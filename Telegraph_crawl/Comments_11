<p>and Cameron expects me to continue to support the conservatives in the forseeable future? The concept of ever closer union is a fait accompli if we do not leave the eu</p>

<p>The DT seems to be absolutely determined to demonstrate to the world that the UK is largely populated with crackpots.</p>

<p>It has long been the opinion of our continental partners that the UK is largely populated by crackpots.  We should encourage them in their opinion at every opportunity.</p>

<p>It appears that 13% of the DT's readers who took the trouble to 'vote' agree with me (I am an unrepentant Inner). 13% is a good start. Where we finish is the important thing and I look forward to the real result.</p>

<p>Fair enough Geoffrey. I think we should leave, but I respect your right to a different opinion. </p>

<p>Thanks to David Cameron.</p>

<p>  His acceptance, with pleasure of these ridiculous terms clears up any doubt.</p>

<p>Cameron has completely made the case to LEAVE the EU.</p>

<p>So with certainty that you are making the right decision for Britain</p>

<p>Vote to LEAVE the EU.</p>

<p>One has to assume that what he got was all he wanted else he would have been placed in the unfortunate position of having to live up to his promise to campaign to leave the EU if he didn't get a satisfactory result. <br/>Of course, it was just a Cameron promise and we all know what they are worth.</p>

<p>Yesterday thousands of "Telegraph readers" expressed their opinion about this issue. By doing so a large majority of them showed themselves to be barely literate and definitely not numerate, the sort of people that Wm Morrison would not employ as shelf fillers because they couldn't read and understand the labels on tins of food. In my opinion these people should not be allowed to vote on any matter important to the United Kingdom until they have passed an intelligence test.</p>

<p>Are you demeaning others because they do not happen to agree with you?  If so, I would suggest it is you who need testing to ascertain whether you can understand the meaning of English vocabulary such as the word FREEDOM as in freedom of expression and thought.  It would seem you believe that only those who agree with you have such freedom.</p>

<p>Freedom of expression is a relative term, total freedom of expression is not permitted anywhere.</p>

<p>Do you have any proof that what I have said above is not true? If so, demonstrate it.</p>

<p>A sure sign of educational deprivation is when the truth is rejected because it's painful.</p>

<p>I would agree that total freedom of expression is an illusion; however, I was asking you a question which, as with many politicians, you either failed to comprehend or, alternatively, merely ignored.  As to your question about if I have proof that what you have said is not true, at this point I do not; however, if you had read my comment and understood it, you would have seen that I was not commenting as to its veracity or otherwise.</p>

<p>Your comment to me about vermin crawling out of the gutter seems to have been deleted. No matter. Here's my reply: my jibe seems to have struck a nerve - as you've proved - once again.</p>

<p>The problem in Spain is the heat. It fries the brain - as you've proved.</p>

<p>I wouldn't stack shelves at Morrisons, much too common.  </p>

<p>You probably are, much too common.</p>

<p>Please explain your conclusions in detail.  Don't worry if you are only able to use pidgin English.  We will make allowances for you.</p>

<p>'Intelligence test'</p>

<p>Learn English. </p>

<p>Wot?</p>

<p>Cállate idiota.</p>

<p>En Castellano - me cago en la leche de tu puta madre.</p>

<p>I think you hit a nerve. He is starting to rant. </p>

<p>Stop lying, you've never thought in your life.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>You are making it very easy for us to be desperate to leave the EU and determined to never mix with people like you. Thank you. Are you a double agent?</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>You are either raving mad or a very nasty piece of work.  You are obviously a compulsive liar who hates itself.  You are more to be pitied than laughed at.  If the EU needs to sink to paying people like you to troll it is better that we leave right now.</p>

<p>As I said, you are not the type of person I associate with.  Goodbye.</p>

<p>What you know about me will fit on a farthing and leave a "great deal of space to spare. How can you insult someone and expect to get out of it unscathed? What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Your attitude is very immature.</p>

<p>"If the EU needs to sink to paying people" You seriously think the EU pays trolls? There are people who can help your sort, they're called psychiatrists, you don't even have to pay'em,</p>

<p>It's one of the multitudinous benefits of living in the UK.</p>

<p>Feeling nervous? Britain is going to leave. </p>

<p>Yeah, I can imagine that's the word down the pub after a few pints have been swilled down. Funny innit that the pundits who write in the world's most respected financial magazine The Economist don't agree with you? Perhaps you could demonstrate, here and now, why your opinion is more believable than theirs? How much do you get paid for your opinion?</p>

<p>Personally it is of no importance at all to me if Britain stays or goes. Only Brits of proven intelligence should decide that.</p>

<p>There will be a vote. And millions will take part. British people do not fear  their countrymen. The EU should. </p>

<p>The EU has NOTHING to fear, Britain will not be leaving the EU any time soon because an acceptable agreement will be reached with the Brits who matter. You will not be consulted, you're a nonentity.</p>

<p>Sadly we are all a  nonentity as far as the EU is concerned. You may wave your little white flag but the rest of us will attempt to bring our country back to British rule.</p>

<p>Goodbye. </p>

<p>Off on another binge are you?</p>

<p>Try learning German.  They will be your masters from now on. </p>

<p>Warum zum Teufel soll lernen ich Deutsch, wenn ich es bereits sprechen?</p>

<p>So you can beg them for more money. Hint: Work on your word order. </p>

<p>Jerk</p>

<p>You jerk, it'll make you feel better for a minute but it might damage your wrist.</p>

<p>You sound frustrated </p>

<p>Yeah, I am, because the sun went down at 6.0pm and I had to abandon my sun bed on the beach. Never mind, 24ºC again tomorrow and rum and coke is really cheap. Enjoy the jerking.</p>

<p>Rum and coke?  What a chav. </p>

<p>It is what passes as sophistication in the barrio he crawled out of. </p>

<p>Sophistication? ¿Estas loco?</p>

<p>Have you ever considered trying to get a job and pull yourself up out of the gutter?</p>

<p>I don't need to. You are the sad act trying to persuade your nation's meal ticket not to stop paying for your free lunch. And failing. </p>

<p>You have not the slightest idea of what my nation is?</p>

<p>In 2015 I and my family visited 15 countries in central and northern Europe plus Scandinavia and Russia. This year we hope to visit more. As a benefactor of a charity I pay for free lunches. I leave consuming them to the people that need them. Do you fall into that category?</p>

<p>It's surely past your bedtime, what time do you have to be at school tomorrow?</p>

<p>Are you a gypsy?  Perhaps one day you will get a real life.</p>

<p>A real life? If it smacked you in the gob you wouldn't recognise it. My real life alternates between travelling around the world with my family and relaxing on the beach which I can see from my garden.</p>

<p>I imagine you know less about gypsies than you do about real life.</p>

<p>You aren't British. We have already established that. you have no vote in our referendum, you are just trolling people. We will vote to leave. Learn to live with it. </p>

<p>I have the advantage over you. I AM British, you are not. Your English is stilted. It's true that as I no longer live in the UK I can't vote in the referendum as things stand, but that may have to change. The EU is looking into the matter at the request of the many thousands of Brits who don't live in the UK but do live in the EU.</p>

<p>"Learn to live with it"</p>

<p>I have nothing to learn unlike the modern generation of young Brits and am living the best time of my life. I had an excellent grammar school education, worked hard for 55 years, learned 4 languages and am now benefiting from my own personal effort. You on the other hand appear to be a poor soul looking for a hole to fit in. No education, no job and no future. That sums up today's young people. Some put an end to it all in Magaluf.</p>

<p>I would have someone look into your self aggrandisement problem, if I were you. ICD-11 may help. </p>

<p>Lying is for naughty little children and the educationally deprived. Some people feel they need to lie all their lives because they've got NOTHING to show for the miserable life they lead. Fortunately I, at the present time, have NO problem, it's excruciatingly obvious that you cannot say the same.</p>

<p>In the context that you've used it ICD-11 is meaningless. You did the same with Q.E.D. How old are you, 10, 11?</p>

<p>Beats that horrible warm beer that they sell at exorbitant prices in the UK and Magaluf. Of course it's cheaper in Magaluf but warmer and does nothing to ensure accuracy when trying to jump from balcony to balcony.</p>

<p>Cat seems to have got Lady Bertram's tongue.</p>

<p>He's being paid to try to persuade people not to leave the EU, but is finding he is not up to the job. </p>

<p>That sums it up.  He and those like him are either very rude or speak in cliches.  They are idiots without conscience.</p>

<p>I imagine you know thousands of'em, and you, the only true genius on the planet. You don't know me and therefore you can't know anyone like me.</p>

<p>When are you starting school?</p>

<p>You and those like you are either very rude or speak in cliches. You are an idiot without conscience.</p>

<p>I am afraid I know you only too well by what you write.  I therefore know you are the type of person I have no wish to associate with.  You really are a perfect fit for an EU spokesperson.</p>

<p>I should be so lucky. Sensible people NEVER need to be persuaded about anything. They investigate ALL the facts and reach a well reasoned conclusion without needing any advice from anyone. That cuts out 98% of the present generation of British males.</p>

<p>QED</p>

<p>It's actually Q.E.D., and on its own its meaningless. If you were hoping to get into the Oxford Union Debating Society, you, like Donald, have fallen at the first hurdle.</p>

<p>"on it's own" - it is QED, not Q.E.D.  It's "its" by the way.  Possessive.</p>

<p>You're wrong. Its Q.E.D.</p>

<p>"You're wrong. Its Q.E.D."<br/>Congratulations for removing the apostrophe from the possessive "its" in your original post. I would have done the same if someone had corrected my incorrect usage. Pity you didn't use the apostrophe in your reply.  If you are going to correct other people's use of English, then do it right, otherwise you make yourself a laughing stock.<br/>I am not wrong about QED either. To be  accurate, it would have been Q.E.D. about 60 years ago when I was at school.  The convention now is to lose the full stops for abbreviations.  You aren't wrong, just out of date.  I am keeping up with modern convention.  It's easy to lose touch when you are an ex-pat. That's probably why you are against the UK's leaving the EU.  (Note - not "U.K.'s leaving the E.U.")<br/>Here's the guidance:<br/><a href="http://grammar-monster.com/lessons/abbreviations_full_stops_periods.htm" rel="nofollow">http://grammar-monster.com/les...</a></p>

<p>Cameron's deal does not address the main issue for the vast majority, which is immigration. The measures will have no effect in reducing the numbers coming in.<br/>If this is not sorted the result will be Brexit.</p>

<p>It also does nothing about the unreformed CAP and Fisheries policy, the democratic deficit, the outrageous, unsanctioned, behaviour of Germany in unilaterally tearing up the Dublin Convention, or the regular, anti-British decision making of the EU commission over many years. </p>

<p>"A senior Romanian government source, who also insisted on anonymity, <br/>added: “We are analysing this proposal. Changes like this have been <br/>considered a red line for us until now so we are debating what to do and<br/> how to react."</p>

<p>he will soon find out about the British public's Red Line.....and he won't like it.</p>

<p>“The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the<br/> apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the <br/>Soviet Union in Western Europe.”</p>

<p>  ―<br/>    Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>

<p>As has been shown time after time, Telegraph polls rarely tend to be representative of the country as a whole.</p>

<p>Just like the last General Election?</p>

<p>Telegraph polls tend to prove that when the older generation say that Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and Tony Crossland destroyed the British education system, they are right, without any shadow of doubt.</p>

<p>Most of the present generation cannot multiply 7x9 without the aid of a calculator, but they can tell you where Magaluf is and the fun to be had there trying to leap from hotel balcony to hotel balcony and sometimes missing their aim, leaving some poor soul to clean a mess up on the ground.</p>

<p>These people have never grown up so why should they be allowed to vote?</p>

<p>Which is why the country is in such a mess.</p>

<p>Listening to Cameron this afternoon, I began to wonder what the man was blathering on about.<br/>He stated that his negotiations meant that, we weren't part of the Euro, Schengen, closer political unity; nor would we subscribe to a future Euro-Army, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Strikes me that with that level of detachment, nobody, fully IN the union, is going to take much notice of Great Britain.</p>

<p>If Cameron thinks his negotiated opt-outs are so good, he might as well go the whole hog (sorry about that David) and campaign to Leave.</p>

<p>"Strikes me that with that level of detachment, nobody, fully IN the union, is going to take much notice of Great Britain."</p>

<p>You mean they will totally disregard the 55 million £ that the UK pays in every week? I don't think so because that money will have to be found elsewhere to keep the EU afloat. Even little kids in countries like Sweden and Finland know that no UK no EU.</p>

<p>£55,000,000 every day. </p>

<p>There are 2 people standing in front of the door to number 10.</p>

<p>One is a crafty, wily politician who actually brings money into his country. The other is a complete sucker.</p>

<p>Like to have a go at guessing which is which ?</p>

<p>In an article in today's DT  (No comments allowed) Raoul Ruparel, Co-director, Open Europe writes The commitment to exclude the UK from "ever closer union" and "political integration", allowing for "different paths" and that not all EU states are heading to a "common destination" is a strong statement of "here and no further".</p>

<p>Open Europe claims to be a "Think tank". Even a tiny amount of thought (to say nothing of research and observation) would convince any thinker that the EU ignores democracy and lies whenever it seeks an advantage. A strong statement is valueless, as valueless it seems as Open Europe's thinking ability.</p>

<p>If this were true then we would be in the position to legitimately finally throw off the Maastricht conditions on our economy which are intended to be "preparing" us to join the Euro.</p>

<p>So true. Even the "ever closer union" opt-out itself is premised on a supposition that everyone not in the Euro currently (aside from Denmark and the UK who have opt-out clauses) won't be in ten years from now. Whereupon the 8 now notionally allies to some slight extent (though in practice not really since we force-fund them as members but won't be doing so once we leave) will be in the 'in' camp majority bullying those outside it, and only we and plucky Denmark shouting our grievances from outside it forlornly on fat deaf ears, just judging by how the world worked when I got up this morning anyway.</p>

<p>A vote for yes is a vote for neverendum. Think Scotland only far more prescient. At least Scotland don't now, and never will alone, have the clout to do the rest of us here any great harm.</p>

<p>A vote for remaining can only ever be be a vote for less independence and less sovereignty, a piecemeal chipping away bit by bit and eternally while one Quisling PM after another lines up to tell us how lucky we are, until at last there is nothing of this nation left worth bickering over.</p>

<p>On the other hand, of course, you are one of the world's most renowned philosophers.</p>

<p>Do ask your minder to give you better lines.</p>

<p>You guessed.  Well spotted.</p>

<p>What the headline actually means is that 80+% of the usual suspects don't want anything to do with Cameron or his deal and never did.<br/>He could have come back with the moon and they still wouldn't have been happy.<br/>Let's see what people in the <b>real </b>world think when the referendum comes.<br/>My money says 57:43 for in. At least!</p>

<p>If Cameron had come back with Poland contributing to us £12bn a year rather than the other way round, and Cameron ready to abolish council tax across the UK, I would have been quite pleased.</p>

<p>But since he insists on being a sucker, then no he can get stuffed.</p>

<p>Even if membership of the EU were free, like it is for the Spanish, Italians and Poles, I would still reject it. Look at what membership of the EU has done to Greece and Cyprus. </p>

<p>In the case of Italy YOU ARE WRONG, VERY WRONG. For many years Italy contributed more than the UK. In the case of Spain you're 95% correct. In the case of Poland, slightly less so. Ask your mum to tell you about Eurostat.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the writing has been on the wall for sometime. Cameron's messaging has been less and less forceful over the past several months and sure enough, what has been agreed is tantamount to a handshake and a gentleman's agreement with JCJ about the public story, with no meaningful change.</p>

<p>A lot of the messaging on here is about immigration; reasonable as it is one of the current agenda items. The broader problem here is that this European project will only ever succeed if the end goal is reached - a fully federal Europe with member states where the most important economic and political decisions are taken centrally. The path to getting there is via a bunch of unelected bureaucrats who are trying desperately to hold a failing EU together.</p>

<p>Cameron has taken the path of "I don't want to be remembered as the guy who drove us out of Europe and as responsible for EU break-up". Such a shame and a missed opportunity. Career politics over courage and doing the right thing. Look at how hard they fought to keep Greece in; a small country with tiny economic contribution. We are the 5th largest economy on the world - that's leverage to strike a far better deal and drive treaty change.</p>

<p>As I sit here in the USA on business (and the US does have some amusing issues of its own...GOP assassination by a certain D Trump) it's clear to see that Europe is seen as a hotbed of failure points right now...cannot manage it's economy, cannot maintain unity, cannot protect its borders, cannot provide a proposition that keeps it members loyal etc etc.</p>

<p>Let's hope the out campaign gets some very strong leadership and far better coverage otherwise the referendum will come and go and the electorate will be too afraid to vote to leave. The alternative is sadly being sucked further towards government by Brussels. What a ghastly thought.</p>

<p>I wonder how many more migrants and how much more chaotic Calais will be by May/ June ? That, I'm sure will sway a hell of a lot of votes.</p>

<p>I think you will hear a lot from Germamy about how they intend to now get tough on migration, until that is the 24th June and then it will be back to normal! </p>

<p>Will Cameron or most of the Tories pay attention? No! Not even to the readers of the Torygraph....But then why should they when their voters continue to vote for them?</p>

<p>Is this the most deceitful prevaricating politician since the slimy Blair,he appears to have laid on his back with legs akimbo to the EU brigade more  times than a Brussels whore.<br/>This is a prime example of the behaviour of these snakes we must get the hell out before we are tied in forever to this putrid corpse,its already imploding and we will be pulled down with it if we don't cut loose now</p>

<p>Are the Brits totally mad? Blair came to power as a result of how BRITS voted. Cameron came to power as a result of how BRITS voted. Do BRITS always vote for the wrong people or is it you that thinks everyone except you is wrong? If it's YOU than the medical profession can help you.</p>

<p>Fine words.</p>

<p>In the face of the EU's gross failures of governance, negotiating a deal on benefit claimants is akin to moving the deckchairs on the Titanic.</p>

<p>A challenge for some of the (presumably paid) Juncker groupies who have an unfortunate habit of infesting these threads.......I play you the migrant/refugee crisis and the ongoing implosion of the single currency. How will you see me in return?</p>

<p>I don't think it even amounts to moving deck-chairs.  At best it's re-laying a knife and fork because one passenger ordered the fish course and another ordered steak.</p>

<p>If we ever do get to vote I have absolutely no faith that the vote will be fair after the levels of blatant postal voting fraud in Oldham. 'Democracy is dead' as someone recently said.</p>

<p>The people who say "democracy is dead" should be provided with free travel to Pyongyang, they would quickly find out how lucky they are to live in a country that's been a democracy since 1215.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if they conduct it fairly. If they lose, the EU will insist on another one "because we clearly didn't understand the question and must have therefore got the answer wrong".</p>

<p>The EU will have no say in it. We will leave. </p>

<p>Sadly we do not have referendum legislation as Switzerland does and as such the referendum is likely to be little more than a poor "customer survey".<br/>We may vote to leave but even though the referendum will be a simple In/Out choice, Cameron has a number of cop-outs including:<br/>1) They didn't vote to leave but to say they are unhappy with the deal so far achieved. Therefore we will remain in and re-run the referendum in five years after I have had the opportunity to win a better deal. Oh, and of course, you'll have to vote me a third term after all."<br/>2) The margin by which the electorate has voted to leave does not represent a clear and decisive result. Therefore we will remain within the EU and re-run the referendum at some future date to seek a clear and decisive result. (this option was set up by his ministers who declared that if we only voted to stay by a narrow margin we should stay but have another vote in five years).</p>

<p>Of course, in all these scenarios it would be better to leave then vote on whether to apply for re-admission given how difficult it is to leave and how easy it is to gain re-admittance.</p>

<p>It would be nice to see us vote to leave but it hasn't been guaranteed that such a result would be binding on government.</p>

<p>Much as I would like us to, it won't happen not with the vast majority of the MSM, Parliamentary establishment and business leaders against us.</p>

<p>I don't think the politicians have cottoned on to the fact that we are going to leave anyway.  You would think that a few of them, being partly British at least, would realise that British determination and gumption will always prevail in the end.<br/></p>

<p>No one in Britain has shown any gumption since the 1960s.<br/>Your granddad must be going wild if he reads your clueless comments here.</p>

<p>Apparently there was agreement that ministers would remain neutral until the final deal was fully approved. Cameron is out campaigning but says that collective cabinet responsibility will be enforced prior to the final package.</p>

<p>Cameron has a decidedly EU view of democracy (he wants to destroy ours) it's time for ministers to put their Country first and face down the snake oil salesman.</p>

<p>Sorting out the postal vote system has not been given high priority on the Westminster agenda.</p>

<p>"It's not who votes that counts, but who counts the votes"  attrib. Stalin</p>

<p>They can prove they are above board by not allowing any postal votes, or group votes, for such an important decision.</p>

<p>But will they?  I'm not holding my breath on that one...</p>

<p>Nor me.  But we have to get our country back.  You know, decent, relaxed, straightforward and peaceful,</p>

<p>You've got more chance of meeting a virgin in a maternity ward.</p>

<p>The runaway UK train went down the track &amp; it blew, the runaway train went down the track.......with the emergency brake thrown out at the back &amp; Cameron blew, blew, blew.</p>

<p>Except he isn't blue - he's yellow, yellow, yellow.</p>

<p>The PM announced the EU was good for jobs with the search for thousands of 'mechanism' apprentices to maintain the agreement on offer.....55% of EU leaders said when asked.....the mechanisms will never be used or allowed if the truth were known.</p>

<p>As the PM announced a third 'mechanism' to assist the 1st &amp; 2nd mechanism for the 4 year halt in benefit payments.... yet another mechanism was introduced as he spoke, this mechanism had no obvious use ...whereas in the fact it replaced the parentheses after the brackets afore the comma which brought about an emergency brake that didn't actually work.......got em shouted Juncker as Merkel just smiled.</p>

<p>A perplexed PM read the note passed to him &amp; thought.....just how much urine do they expect me to extract from the UK electorate ?</p>

<p>"huge majority of the 8,200 readers who had taken our poll "</p>

<p>The problem is that the "majority" of those contributing to your comments about the poll are so obviously here at the behest of their Marxist masters just to ridicule Cameron's education at Eton, his "posh" friends" and the fact that he is a Tory.</p>

<p>The DT cannot rely on their warped views to reflect the public view (remember the General Election polls!)</p>

<p>You obviously don't know that the readers of the DT will accept anything but the truth. You're right but the truth hurts, so the thousands of ill educated louts reject the truth and insult you as if it were your fault that they're largely pig-ignorant brain washed fools.</p>

<p>Your comment is up there for "Contrived nonsense of the year" (CNOTY) !</p>

<p>Doubt if the Beeb will host it though, as quite a lot of their output is in the running too.</p>

<p>Apart from doing an excellent job of showing us what a bigot you are, why do you keep reading a paper that you obviously have total contempt for ?</p>

<p>What a numpty you are.  Don't just look at the DT, look at both other MSM AND non MSM sources - and the reaction is the same.  Many voted Tory not UKIP because of Cams promise of a referendum.  But 4m of us did vote UKIP - people I speak to who don't visit comments boards are all absolutely united in voting LEAVE.  <br/>And calling those that do not want to lose our British Sovereignty 'warped' is laughable.</p>

<p>I voted Tory because I couldn't risk a Labour/Sturgeon coalition. It's as simple as that.</p>

<p>Had that not been a possibility then I would have struggled to know where to put my vote.</p>

<p>Despite being a lifelong Tory apart,  from my very first voting experience, I was struggling to support them, given the coalition policies.</p>

<p>While I know I could never bring myself to vote Labour,  and would rather have my finger nails pulled out than vote for Corbyn, I'm struggling to see the Conservative party I used to feel I had something in common with.</p>

<p>I don't have any faith in this deal and we have had no information on how they intend to deal with migration, legal or otherwise. I will be voting to leave, but I suspect they're trying to get this done, while the leave campaign is all over the place and to reduce the risk of too many questions being asked.</p>

<p>I think the electorate are going to go with better the devil you know, than the devil you don't!</p>

<p>I hope not. </p>

<p>What a stupid, ill-informed remark.  Pointless attempts at brainwashing propaganda which flies in the face of all the information and facts staring us in the face just shames and belittles those who try to use such methods rather than have any effect on those who know exactly where their loyalties lie.  To Britain and the British people.</p>

<p>To think that wanting to leave the undemocratic. Marxist, bureaucratic. fourth reich the EU has become is because we are Marxists is so laughable it makes you seem an even bigger fool than you could possibly be.</p>

<p>¡Payaso!.</p>

<p>Elitist paranoia</p>

<p>Vote to remain in the EU if you like seeing the role of our Prime Minister relegated to a EUro puppet with 'One size fits all' policies being foisted on the people of Europe without their consent. So no matter what's right &amp; fair &amp; appropriate for one country, it still must go with the flow &amp; be dictated to by other countries &amp; unelected commisioners.</p>

<p>The EU is a completely useless construct just like the old Soviet Union<br/>It is precisely what we fought two world wars &amp; a cold war to avoid !<br/>Young men paid with their lives for our freedom.<br/>All we need do is put our cross in the right box to retrieve it<br/>EU democracy = NO democracy<br/>EU Soviet &gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92Vjc_PeYtc" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</a></p>

<p>'Vote to remain in the EU if you like seeing the role of our Prime Minister relegated to a EUro puppet '.<br/>That's all he ever has been.</p>

<p>Since Maastricht certainly</p>

<p>If we were not in the EU now and I was asked would I vote to join. I certainly would - says Cameron. Which proves he is either thick or a bit deranged and certainly proves that he has no concern for the people of the UK. I don't often visit the cities but I went t Manchester the other day and was astounded at the increase in the number of beggars. Some of ours yes, very sad cases but many not. Mainly E European Gypsies. This did not used to be the case. I have always voted Tory but I am finished with them now as long as this lot are around. What with a left wing chancellor and a PM who seems to have lost his marbles along with his credibility, its too much.</p>

<p>I think the real truth is that they wouldn't have clue on how to run the country outside of the EU.</p>

<p>No worries. We are an intelligent people, quite capable of running ourselves. </p>

<p>Thanks, we're only in February but I can't imagine anyone making a more stupid remark this year.</p>

<p>Well said.  That's what they don't like and tried so hard to destroy.  Fortunately, they went too far and we have woken up.  Yet again.</p>

<p>Cameron has said as much. Makes me wonder about  these Eton and Oxford boys. Privileged education does not automatically make a smart boy!!! Far from it as demonstrated in spades by Cameron and Osborne for example.</p>

<p>They may have had privileged educations t institutes of higher education but not a lot of contact with folk in the mainstream of national life.  The same goes for the other lot as presently constituted.  Corbyn and Ms Thornberry are living on cloud nine IMHO.</p>

<p>We need those who are quick witted, far sighted, contemplative and patriotic rather than those who want to be part of a gang where they can show off.</p>

<p>Mr Cameron and those wanting to stay in the EU believe that we are unable to govern ourselves and that permission has to be asked of others before we can change a law or change the terms of trade. This will never be acceptable to anyone who believes in democratic accountability. The 'renegotiation' should have been about a full return to sovereign nation status.</p>

<p>Remember Chamberlain waving his bit of paper ?  Some things never change.</p>

<p>Remember Blair selling the UK down the river over the Treaty of Lisbon for his own career? Well Cameron has just done the same. Some things never change.</p>

<p>LibLabCon voters demanded Blair and Cameron do the things they did! </p>

<p>Brown &amp; D Miliband as Foreign Sec signed the Treaty not Blair</p>

<p>Really? I was sure it was Blair. Either way the point remains. Any belief that politicians will act in the best interests of their electorate is naive. As they say, how do you tell when a politician is lying? His lips are moving. <br/>And Cameron's lips are moving, and moving &amp; moving.</p>

<p>Brown and the Millipede were only doing Tony B lier's bidding.  Not that they needed only real encouragement.</p>

<p>From all I have read it would seem that the PM has returned to the U.K. with precisely NOTHING.  Any and all of the factors which he says have been at least partially satisfied are subject to the whims of other states and we all know they are unlikely to agree if it means the U.K. taxpayers will no longer have to subsidize the living standards of their citizens or comply with E.U. laws (however stupid or nonsensical they may be), or allowing the U.K. to have control over its borders and sling out those who cannot or will not comply with the reasonable standards of British society.  It makes me wonder if, in fact, the PM secretly is hoping the electorate will see sense and vote to exit this egregious club.  If that is so, I truly hope that secret wish turns out to be true.</p>

<p>I think it is the other way round. I believe most Government officials are pretty worried about having to make all the tough decisions involved in running our country; hard work they are not used to, or signed up to undertake!</p>

<p>Thats been my opinion for a long time. They are congenitally work shy.</p>

<p>Either congenitally work-shy or congenitally stupid.  Either way the results are the same.  No wonder Mr. Junkhead and Ms. (Nutcase) Merkel get away with foisting their nonsense on the electorate.  Let's hope that the U.K. voters will deliver a "Get Stuffed Europe" come the referendum and not be afraid of being out in the real world.</p>

<p>BEWARE THE BBC BIAS<br/>The head of public policy at the Institute of Economic Affairs brings us a preview of upcoming analysis by News-Watch, which finds BBC coverage of our Eu membership is blatantly biased. <a href="http://www.cityam.com/233576/the-eu-referendum-is-too-important-to-be-left-to-the-bbc" rel="nofollow">http://www.cityam.com/233576/t...</a></p>

<p>- Knitting together all of News-Watch’s samples of EU coverage on Radio 4’s Today programme between March 2004 and June 2015, we found that, of 4,275 guest speakers on EU themes, a paltry 3.2 per cent (132) were identifiably in favour of leaving the EU. Of these, 72 per cent were representatives of UKIP and 37 per cent were Nigel Farage alone. In that time, just three left-leaning withdrawalist voices appeared.<br/>- In a January 2013 edition of Newsnight devoted to discussing Cameron’s announcement of an In-Out referendum, Farage was the sole declared Brexiteer of 19 guests (this “drip, drip, drip” of guest selection is that support for Brexit is a fringe issue linked irrevocably to UKIP, even though between a third and a half of the British people have favoured exiting throughout that period, and statistically that cannot represent only UKIP supporters).<br/>- Business - The Today programme had 25 business speakers who answered questions on the EU referendum during the general election campaign. Of these, 19 said the referendum was a worry or a threat. None openly backed leaving. Given Business for Britain and YouGov polling suggests business backed the referendum by 66 per cent to 25 per cent, it is reasonable to assume that a substantial proportion believed Britain would be better off economically outside the EU or at least that the referendum would not be overly damaging for their business. Yet they found no voice on the Today programme in the crucial election period.</p>

<p>The BBC is the equivalent of France's Vichy government.</p>

<p>No they are the worse type of the enemy within.  The pretend friend who is the enemy within.</p>

<p>The BBC is in full propaganda mode now - but relax, after the cover ups of Cologne and Jimmy Saville no one believes a word they say any more.</p>

<p>The BBC is a joke now - and a lot of their employees know it.</p>

<p>I look forward to the world post Brexit, we can our attention to them and their lies.</p>

<p>Don't know why anyone listens to/watches that hateful propaganda machine any more!  Bad for the blood pressure and as for paying to be indoctrinated................!</p>

<p>I barely watch anything on Beeb now - certainly NOT news or current affairs.  QT is now unwatchable - and Dimbleby is way past his sell by date.</p>

<p>I know, tell me about it.</p>

<p>Yes, Laura Kuenssberg was in full sneer mode this morning when discussing those who want to leave.</p>

<p>Yes. They (and C4, who do actually have a common-purpose remit at least so…..) are fond of calling the audible expressions of the public will, and democracy in general, 'Populism' these days.</p>

<p>For me that fact is just one more reason to vote 'Out'.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Can someone explain this, the young of this Country think that being part of the EU circus is wonderful. Has anyone explained that the more people we let in the less there will be for them. Less school places, less housing, less less less and yet they are all so very pro aren't they. Crazy World or is it brainwashing?</p>

<p>Just as the Jesuits said:-  Give me the boy (or the young folk) and I will give you the man.</p>

<p>Why do you think that?  Not any I know.  Are you just taking notice of what they want yu to believe?</p>

<p>If your post has more than 140 characters they wont understand it....&amp; anyway they've a pointless petition to sign afore falling into a puddle &amp; drowning as no one had explained the dangers of the shallow end</p>

<p>Is anyone else getting silly 'mechanical' messages when they try to comment?</p>

<p>You've answered your own question at the last.</p>

<p>Despite the embarrassing sight of our PM taking the begging bowl around the EU and coming back with the crumbs from the table I still think that the vote will be to stay in. I think there are still many tricks left in the 'stay in camp' to be unveiled and most of them will rely on scaremongering and a high percentage of frightened and gutless voters. Let's face it. There are enough of the gutless type in the cabinet already. If by some miracle the UK vote to leave then Cameron and his pro EU cronies are finished. If the vote is to stay in then there will never again be a majority Government after the next general election and UKIP will probably hold the balance of power. Whatever happens, our relationship with the EU will never be the same again and amen to that.</p>

<p>With Labour supporting EU membership and their blind cult-followers, I think you could be right and not much extra input is required by the pro-EU conservatives.</p>

<p>What deal? As the Chief Executive of Quidnet Capital Partners surmised, "The PM talks about substantial changes, but this is just a restatement of the existing system". This outline of 'changes' that wholly lack substantial measures that would require treaty change, make Tusk's letter little more than a press release. <br/>The Institute of Economic Affairs say staying in the EU would cost Britain at least £9,265 per household each year, or a staggering 13% of GDP, and this against the best estimate of the CBI claiming the nett benefit to be around just 5% of GDP, but with half of even that effect 'assumed' and a less than comprehensive appraisal of all the costs of membership when arriving at even that miserly figure, there is no contest fiscally. <a href="http://www.cityam.com/233671/eu-referendum-institute-of-economic-affairs-say-staying-in-the-uk-would-cost-britain-at-least-9265-per-household-each-year?ITO=sidebar-most-read" rel="nofollow">http://www.cityam.com/233671/e...</a><br/>As Brian Monteith, Communications Director of Global Britain, writes today:  <a href="http://www.cityam.com/233683/camerons-eu-deal-is-the-biggest-political-fudge-in-history?ITO=sidebar-the-forum" rel="nofollow">http://www.cityam.com/233683/c...</a><br/>We just need to spin back to the speeches made by the Prime Minister at his party conferences or to his Bloomberg address in January 2013 to see how much he has retreated from his original ambitions for reform. Denying in-work benefits to migrants was never an issue in the past. The issue has always been public disquiet about the quantity and the quality of migration, due to Britain’s inability to control the unlimited access of EU citizens. Open Europe calculates that only 15 per cent of EU migrants would be impacted by restrictions on in-work benefits. That is why an economist at the Office for Budget Responsibility has said that changes to benefits will not make any noticeable difference to migration levels. What does attract migrants is our relatively high minimum wage, making bar staff hourly rates attractive to East European engineers. So what does our government do? It increases the UK minimum wage to one of the highest in the EU, more than cancelling out any gain that temporary benefit restrictions might provide. In short, one of the centrepieces of the Prime Minister’s deal is a reform that no one asked for which will do nothing to tackle the problem the public is actually concerned about.</p>

<p>He was never strong enough to be a leader. All he will ever be is a follower. Certainly a major embarrassment to this once great country.<br/>Be gone your time is up.</p>

<p>I think that will happen after the referendum.</p>

<p>The cosy arrangement of Lib/Lab/Con will end, the Scots showed the way and rejected Westminster, time for the rest of us to do the same.</p>

<p>Not sure what you mean; the Scots rejected the SNP take-over of Scotland and voted to stay with Westminster, thank goodness. We don't want to stay with the EU!</p>

<p>Katherine I accept the correction, my poorly expressed point was the Scots have rejected Labour, constitutional arrangements mean that the SNP has to sit in parliament but I think the Scots see that as a necessary evil.</p>

<p>For me the lesson was Scotland still wants to remain in the Union (but only just) but clearly they have had enough of  the public school boy club that sits in Westminster.</p>

<p>I am shoulder to shoulder with them on that one.</p>

<p>The Times said that the so-called concessions won by Cameron can be stopped at any time by the EU/MEPs, presumably since no treaty change is required.</p>

<p>So even if he had got everything the skeptics wanted, there's no guarantee that they would last.</p>

<p>Not all sceptics wanted a deal anyway. Some of us just want to leave.</p>

<p>Most of us want to leave.</p>

<p>The deal was all Cameron's advisor's creation, to fudge the issue and delay the process, aided by the compliant media he has managed to steer the narrative away from 'leave', to one of stay in a reformed EU.</p>

<p>Well, we just have to make sure we do not fall for it.</p>

<p>The game is not over yet and our dave will make a wonderful last minute recovery to save the day . Just follow the script , sorry deceit .</p>

<p>I don't think there is any convincing of the Left that we should vote to leave the EU. A few people seem to see sense, but the rest are willing to even take the side of big business and people like Mandelson and Clarke. And outers are allegedly the ideologues here?<br/>Can only hope that the undecided voters swing it for out.</p>

<p>I think the migrant crisis is crystallising an lot of peoples thoughts.  They see what is happening in Germany, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Finland and even if they only glance at headlines, will have seen the hideous situation developing.  Even lefties don't want to be flooded with rapefugees.</p>

<p>The left yes but not the former Labour voters. Many who voted UKIP (in the North anyway) previously voted Labour. UKIP had almost 4,000,000 votes. Why did they change to UKIP? Because no-one seems to care as they do that their communities have been changed drastically and they don't like it.</p>

<p>Yes these  folks like to think their hip , whilst forcing down the wages of the young, seeing our public services grind to a halt day after day, welcoming in new corporate Trade agreements such as TTIP. <br/>Goldman Sachs  and Cameron in the same SHAM MARRIAGE - why woudl they vote for this?</p>

<p>That will be the % of votes that need to be rigged.</p>

<p>I remember the Daily Express running a telephone poll once 'Is Britain going to the dogs?'  Call Premium rate number 1 for Yes, number 2 for No.  As if anyone is going to take the trouble to vote No I imagine about 96% of responses were Yes.  Just saying.</p>

<p>Writing.</p>

<p>Currently Telegraph poll says 89% agree that LEAVING the EU is best!!!! - Now about those so called 'Official' polls that apparently show an even split?<br/>I know the Daily Express poll is running at about 87% LEAVE as well!<br/>That is a hell of a majority Dave!!!</p>

<p>That's great because not everyone reads the Telegraph. I could go out in the street and ask folk what they want to happen and I very much believe most would hesitate to answer due to a complete lack of reasoning ability on a subject they 'don't want to get involved with.' The tabloids will pay a big part now, and nearer the actual referendum.</p>

<p>I would like to see such a poll on the Guardian website.</p>

<p>Does the Guardian have a website?  it is a sad thing to see what was once a fine Manchester Newspaper reduced to the state that it is in now.</p>

<p>It does and worth a look at the comments - all is not what you might expect from Guardianistas</p>

<p>Latest poll from the BBC shows 179% of voters want to remain in the EU.</p>

<p>it's up to 183% now!</p>

<p>Wow - yes you are right, I double checked your figures on the Grauniad wbestie.</p>

<p>Here's the truth about Cameron’s EU “Deal”<br/>✓ No treaty change<br/>✓ No repatriation of powers<br/>✓ EU law remains supreme<br/>✓ £55m handed over every day<br/>✓ Open borders</p>

<p>the truth is that the EU have finally understood that we do not want to be absorbed into a federal superstate and that britain is set on a different path to the rest of europe. we are to get an opt out from further integration and ever closer union and i think this is a significant turning point in our relationship with europe.</p>

<p>Ne'er!</p>

<p>Blimey, Mr Cameron, I didn't know you read the DT!</p>

<p>Where is this opt-out going to be enshrined in law, without Treaty change?</p>

<p>it doesnt have to be enshrined in law. it will be in the form of a binding agreement.</p>

<p>Naive aren't you?</p>

<p>The EU can only use the legal instruments it has. Which one will it be?</p>

<p>the member states can agree whatever they want to agree.</p>

<p>Thus the agreement means bugger all....55%...never get them &amp; Cameron knows it, he's selling the UK people a pig in a poke</p>

<p>6 months ago, the media was reporting that the changes would have to be attached to the Lisbon Treaty by a protocol added next time there is a Treaty change.<br/>What has changed?</p>

<p>which is why Cameron's deal can be changed at any time</p>

<p>well if people dont think it is worth the paper it is written on they can vote to leave.</p>

<p>we will</p>

<p>as long as they understand the small print but will Cameron be spelling it out ?</p>

<p>Which according to the Times, can be altered/cancelled by the EU</p>

<p>why would they do that?</p>

<p>The same reason they threw out Cameron's agreement on not asking the UK to bail out Greece?</p>

<p>It's not the why that matters but the fact that they can</p>

<p>"Who would activate the brake, and when? Similar measures contained in <br/>deals with Switzerland allow a brake only when migration poses a <br/>“serious” economic or social challenge." But surely, Switzerland, being outside the EU (&amp; with their own freedom to decide via referenda, what the country wants) do not need this sort of device to try &amp; limit immigration?</p>

<p>Switzerland voted in a national referendum last year to limit work permits to EU citizens. They have until February 2017 to finalise an agreement with the EU. Interestingly at Geneva airport arrivals now there is a sign for EU, British and other passports. They're betting on Brexit!</p>

<p>It's like he went there with an entire country to sell, so that he could pay the benefits bill, and came back with a handful of beans. Not magic ones though, just beans.</p>

<p>The EU has more power over us than Hitler &amp; Napoleon were aiming to get.<br/>All done without firing a shot<br/>Thanks LibLabCon.</p>

<p>The commisioners are un elected and we're out numbered and outvoted voted by foreign MEPs on issues of vital importance to our country.</p>

<p>We are overuled and over run.</p>

<p>EU = An out dated pointless 'one size fits all' undemocratic compromise.</p>

<p>It needs consigning to the waste bin of history like the old Soviet Union which it's getting more like every day &gt;<a href="https://youtu.be/92Vjc_PeYtc" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/92Vjc_PeYtc</a></p>

<p>"we're out numbered and outvoted voted by foreign MEPs on issues of vital importance to our country"</p>

<p>Could you give an example please?</p>

<p>A Maltese bureaucrat deciding on our Bass fishing without even so much as a debate &gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoxBq669SeU" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</a></p>

<p>We have very little say within the EU, and would have far more leverage outside EU as an independent sovereign nation and the world’s 6th largest economy. The UK currently has only 8.4% of voting power ‘say’ in the EU, and the Lisbon Treaty ensured the loss of Britain’s veto in many more policy areas. Britain’s 72 MEPs are a minority within the 736 in the European Parliament (worsening to 73 out of 751 owing to Lisbon changes).</p>

<p>With further enlargement (Croatia, Turkey’s 79 million citizens), British influence would be further watered down.</p>

<p>Individual MEPs have very little power to do anything.</p>

<p>Britain has 78 of them and even if they all voted together, they would be drowned out by the rest of EUrope whose interest seldom match ours.</p>

<p>You will probably also be surprised to learn that MEPs cannot propose EU legislation</p>

<p>That is the sole preserve of the wholly unelected and unaccountable Commission.</p>

<p>MEPs sit on the committees that discuss new legislation but, are given no vote at committee stage (which is why Farage seldom wasted his time with the fisheries group) so, the laws go through to the Parliament with virtually no democratic input whatsoever.</p>

<p>Once there we are again at the mercy of the other 27 member states.</p>

<p>From Nov next year ALL of the remaining national vetoes will be scrapped in favour of QMV and we will be unable to stop even the most damaging EU rules from being thrust upon us.</p>

<p>In effect our country will be run by foreigners</p>

<p>Unless, of course, we vote to leave.</p>

<p>This will give you much greater insight into the democratic deficit in the EU &gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da8ZuF2LSGU" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</a></p>

<p>And this will give you an insight as to how we lost so much</p>

<p>The eu.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to Mr Cameron listing the advantages of the ever closer Union of the EU countries. There are sufficient disadvantages.</p>

<p>Why would he do so?  Tusk explicitly explained what is meant by ever closer union.</p>

<p>EVER closer union is not the same as CLOSER union.</p>

<p>Anything on the primacy of EU law over UK law?<br/>No didn't think so.</p>

<p>At risk of stating the bleeding obvious, the fact that most Telegraph readers want Britain to leave the EU is hardly headline news.</p>

<p>Or that the DT no longer represents the views of its readers....Shame innit?</p>

<p>I think it does, V'man – or at least it tries to. The problem is that, in trying to be nuanced and "responsible," it ends up all over the place. I wish I could put all the paper's recent headlines and first paragraphs on Europe into a list, but stories are constantly updated and headlines replaced (sometime to the opposite) and it would be a thankless, full-time job. As an old Fleet Street hack (once employed by both the Sunday and Daily Telegraph, as well as the Sunday Times and FT), I used to believe in presenting news as fact – what the declaration said, what Cameron said, what Tusk said, what Boris said etc – and opinion as something separate. Today, all that has gone. Opinion is built into all factual presentation, thus slanting the news in favour of the author's, and the paper's, view of the issue. The Telegraph's problem is that it wants to damn all pro-EU facts, but cannot do so because of a nagging sense of guilt, compounded by confusion. Thus, we get self-contained pieces by pro-EU people that are placed, as it were, below the fold, or on the online equivalent of Page 94, set against a blizzard of Brexit propaganda that, like the weather, changes by the hour. What there should be is this: news and information, complete with the reported assessments of the principals concerned; then balanced commentary, reflecting all sides; and, finally, the paper's own opinion and that of its columnists (which would, of course, be overwhelmingly in favour of Brexit). Telegraph readers would benefit from this. So, from the opposite side, would readers of the Guardian. They could still sink their fangs into the EU and its "lackeys" (me included), but they would do so better-informed and with a sense of the opposing point of view based on more than distaste and contempt. We are all Brits and we are (most of us) patriots. If we are going to either stay in or leave the EU, let us at least try to arm ourselves with the facts.</p>

<p>Should a newspaper pander to its readership?</p>

<p>There is a distinction between representation, and obsequiousness, as I'm sure you are aware.</p>

<p>I wasn't aware a newspaper had to 'represent' anyone other than its owner/editor.</p>

<p>Lift the other foot and take aim....</p>

<p>The Common Market free trade agreement we were told we were voting for with no loss of sovereignty in 1975 now has; <br/>A federal state with a parliament<br/>A criminal justice system<br/>A fledgling armed force <br/>An executive commission<br/>A federal police force <br/>Law making powers<br/>A diplomatic agency<br/>A federal prosecutor <br/>A supreme court <br/>A civil service <br/>A currency<br/>An anthem<br/>A president <br/>A flag</p>

<p>Westminster has; <br/>Manifestos<br/>Queens speech to announce proposed legislation<br/>Loyal opposition<br/>Elected MP's enact legislation<br/>Not bound by previous parliaments</p>

<p>The EU has; <br/>No manifestos<br/>No equivalent to a queen's speech to announce proposed legislation<br/>It is a one party state<br/>The unelected commission creates the laws<br/>It is now the highest court in our land<br/>If we vote to remain then this is what's planned for us</p>

<p>1) Our complete assimilation into the German dominated EU superstate<br/>2) Our country being split into 12 regions directly answerable to a Brussels <br/>3) Our country being forced to join the failing EU common currency experiment in 2020 <br/>4) Endless flow of migrants we don't have the homes or infrastructure for</p>

<p>If this isn't anti democratic creeping federalisation then I don't know what it. 50 years of LibLabCon betrayal &gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyBr9RNx4k0" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</a></p>

<p>The British people must vote to leave the EU or lose what is left of their country</p>

<p>Where can I read more about the EU criminal justice system?  How does it operate?</p>

<p>Not in your favour I can assure you.</p>

<p>Really?  What crimes can I be arrested for under it?</p>

<p>Allegedly failing to pay a bar bill in Greece.  You are arrested and sent to Greece first, questions later.</p>

<p>That would be under the Greek criminal justice system.</p>

<p>Next.</p>

<p>Not so.  It is enabled by the EU arrest warrant.  If it was under Greek law there would need to be a court case in the UK where evidence would be needed before any request for extradition would be granted.<br/>May I suggest that before you comment you make some small effort to understand the issues being debated?</p>

<p>In which they are arrested under UK law (which incorporates the EU Arrest Warrant).</p>

<p>Breathing?</p>

<p>" He will be given new powers to stop suspected terrorists and criminals coming to the UK."</p>

<p>Now there's a clause you can drive a bus through - if you want to. Just claim to suspect every immigrant of being a terrorist or criminal until proven otherwise. <br/>of course this is not going to happen because Cameron doesn't really want these things, he simply wants to find an excuse to keep us in the EU and ideally to have his cake and eat it too by having a referendum that endorses staying in. If the referendum says to leave then he will simply ignore it. He has plenty of excuses prepared and myriads of "it's in our best interests" cop-outs..</p>

<p>Of course, some of us, those who think his deal a waste of space, will be wondering at what point he keeps his promise to campaign to leave. Just kidding. We all know what Cameron's promises are worth.</p>

<p>They just chuck their passports into the Mediterranean and say they're Syrian refugees, how can anyone prove otherwise?</p>

<p>DNA tests.</p>

<p>Measured against what?</p>

<p>'Just claim to suspect every immigrant of being a terrorist or criminal until proven otherwise. of course this is not going to happen '<br/>Agreed although they don't seem to have too much trouble applying that criteria to law biding citizens in general.</p>

<p>Ah yes, the European Arrest warrant.<br/>For someone claiming to want to repatriate powers, how come Cameron was so keen to force through the EU's police and Justice bill when it came up? <br/>And not e how he was able to rely on the political consensus to force it and everything else EU through despite major revolts in his own party.</p>

<p>He's not even clever enough to disguise his own duplicity.</p>

<p>Hello from Europe.  Don't shoot the messenger, I'm a Brit that runs two companies and imports a lot from the UK.  But as no media outlet seems capable of conveying some simple facts, I thought I'd try:</p>

<p>1) Most EU member countries will NOT give you a social security number without a job - Benelux, France, Germany etc.  Without a social security number you cannot claim benefits.  Other countries have minimum requirements of paid work - a year, two years etc.  <br/>2) What the EU don't accept is a two-tier system - one rule for natives / one rule for migrants.  <br/>3) No other EU state has a 'free healthcare system' like the NHS - a big attraction to migrants.  My health insurance in Holland costs between €2-300 per month.  The Dutch have the same system for all but those earning above €30k must pay insurance - also for their children.<br/>4) English is the 2nd language of a lot of Eastern European migrants.<br/>5) Britain is actually a very tolerant society - celebrates other cultures.  Despite the 'liberal' hype (nonsense) Holland / Sweden / Germany and France are very much 'our way or the highway'.<br/>6) EU labour rates are daft in France, Germany and Benelux.  Landscape Gardeners in my local village charge €55ph - I've brought across fencers, roofers and even painter / decorators because the locals are so expensive.  If the media publicised this it may be more interesting for a brickie to work in Amsterdam for a week and fly back on EasyJet at the weekends.  Auf Wiedershen Pet it ain't.  Even designers in A'dam are between €80-100ph compared with 35quid in London - I use Brits as often as possible.<br/>7) Gordon Brown has created such a labyrinth of a welfare system that it's hard to unpick but if GB scrapped all the 'tax credits' and redrafted the legislation that you had to work &amp; 'pay in' to get benefits - but same rule for all - they'd stop the benefit claiming migrant issues.<br/>8) The media, left, right and in the middle - even the BBC - continue with this Cameron vs Junker / GB vs EU storyline because it taps into the bulldog spirit etc. - it's nonsense.<br/>9) The majority of people in Europe don't want 'ever closer union'.<br/>10) Europe is not in recession as is the received wisdom - there's a big difference between Northern Europe and the 'manjana' Med - I wish Peston would accept that.</p>

<p>Personally, I think GB will vote NO because of the way the narrative has been spun - and all the migrant issues / Greek basketcase economics.  But, as someone who's lived and worked and run businesses in Europe for 20years, I find it sad and frustrating that no one explains the simple truths.</p>

<p>Yes I lived and worked i France. You have to have a job to get into the system and have had to have been in it for two years to get anything out. In addition even after that it Medical and dental appointments and treatment are only subsidized to a certain %age. To cover it all a top up insurance is necessary. But who would bring that in here? Certainly not Cameron or the EU or EU members  as they see it as ideal economic sense for their citizens and themselves.</p>

<p>We are all aware that healthcare systems in the EU are funded in different ways and none of them are "free": Far from being "free", the NHS is possibly the most expensive of all in taxation terms and is already bursting at the seams. It's problems are never out of the news.</p>

<p>Numerous studies have shown the NHS to be one of the cheapest and 'best value' health services in the developed world.</p>

<p>Here's a report in the DT that you could add to your compendium of studies. It's a year old but I'd say the reported failings of the NHS then are a lot worse today.<br/>BTW, glad to see you've dropped the adjective free in favour of best value</p>

<p>A fan of the lethal nhs as well as the evil eu! </p>

<p>A great pity the BBC does not interview you.</p>

<p>Fantastic comment.</p>

<p>It's people like you who we need to hear from. Some home truths. Keep it up please.</p>

<p>it looks like the EU has recognised that britain is set on a different course to the rest of europe.<br/>they have finally understood that we do not want to be absorbed into a federal superstate. i think this is a significant turning point in our relationship with europe and whether we stay in the EU or leave we are going to remain an independent sovereign nation.</p>

<p>You're Mr Cameron &amp; I claim my £5!</p>

<p>Where on Earth did you get that idea?  Hollande is already plotting to make the UK pay the Tobin tax.</p>

<p>it is what EU leaders have just announced.</p>

<p>'and whether we stay in the EU or leave we are going to remain an independent sovereign nation'<br/>If Britain stays it will be neither of the above as independant sovereign states will not survive in the 'ever closer intergration' agenda of the EU. The EU is committed to the destruction of Nation states, that was the reason for its inception.</p>

<p>the whole point is that we will be exempt from further integration and ever closer union.</p>

<p>On what basis?</p>

<p>on the basis that i have just explained.</p>

<p>Britain will not be exempt fron further integration unless you are somebody who believes in fairies, or any promises from Cameron.</p>

<p>you have clearly not understood a word of what i am saying.</p>

<p>"the whole point is that we will be exempt from further integration and ever closer union"<br/>Is what you said, and I'm saying 'we' won't.</p>

<p>you have failed to understand that our relationship with the EU is changing fundamentally.</p>

<p>Ha! ha! ha!  Oooh you are a one for the jokes!</p>

<p>He's just a troll.....</p>

<p>When will Cameron tell the T-R-U-T-H We can NOT change the terms of the Lisbon Constitution. End of. Period. He is just a F@KING actor. Can someone please throw an egg into his coiffured hair - please...?</p>

<p>You also realise that truth is more truthy when you type it T-R-U-T-H.</p>

<p>Cameron thinks he has done well with his negotiating. How can he possibly understand the wishes of ordinary people living in the Westminster bubble as he does.<br/>The whole thing is a sham. <br/>Teresa May is now going to side with the P M. What goodies has she been given.<br/>Cameron and the shambles in Parliament just don,t get it.<br/>For all our sakes vote LEAVE. Before its to late.</p>

<p>Probably some dirt on her past was dug up. The same happened to the now strangely quiet Hague.</p>

<p>Deal or no deal by Dave, we need more information about the full implications of leaving the EU.  As an ex-pat in France I am desperate for information.  A truly sincere government acting in our interests, would set up a help line staffed by people who are trained to answer questions from confused voters about leaving or remaining in the EU.  Will it happen? Never.  Too many agendas benefiting from the electorate's ignorance and fear.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that no-one knows what will happen if we leave.  It might be unlikely but no-one in the Out campaign can guarantee that you won't be marched on to the next UK bound plane.</p>

<p>Don,t be so ridiculous.</p>

<p>By leaving the EU do you want to end 'freedom of movement'?</p>

<p>I want to end freedom of movement for anybody just to walk in. I want us to man our own borders.</p>

<p>So under your system what would happen to the people already here?</p>

<p>If if they have a job and can support themselves they can stay. I am not saying we don't want migrants,but we must be able to choose who we let in.</p>

<p>Then you seem to miss the entire issue that the majority of people here are arguing - the vast, vast majority of EU migrants work and support themselves.</p>

<p>Its you who doesn't see. The word is CHOOSE.</p>

<p>How would we choose to let in?  On what basis?</p>

<p>On how much of a burden on the state they will be or become.  A nurse from New Zealand will be an asset, a drug dealing, unemployable Somali will not.</p>

<p>How many Somali nurses are there working in the NHS?</p>

<p>Australia has already solved that one for us.</p>

<p>Next.</p>

<p>OK, so here's next, say we introduce a points based system, what's to stop other countries doing the same in retaliation to the UK?</p>

<p>I hope they do, it's better that Britons emigrate to where they are needed and in respectful numbers and not become a burden like the one's here.</p>

<p>Nothing - they'd be sensible to do so.</p>

<p>It will be a "phoney war", for ages SFA will change!</p>

<p>Before we get over-excited at David's box of delights, no deal is yet secured - it has still   to be agreed by 28 member states.</p>

<p>And the chances of that are a big fat zero!</p>

<p>Best video ever:  William Hague in 2008 mocking and demolishing the idea that the red card system could ever work.</p>

<p>Video posted by Nick Sutton at 9.56 under the live coverage of the main article: Five Senior Ministers....</p>

<p>I don't know how to repost it, but I urge everyone to watch it.   Please,please Nick Sutton, keep posting it.</p>

<p>Truth is that the renegotiations have not achieved anything.<br/>Thus in order to get a better deal we must vote to Leave.</p>

<p>You seem to have changed your tune?</p>

<p>Not at all.. <br/>I have always written that I will start off with a mind to Leave but do the right thing and analyse the "renegotiation" to see if it is enough to stay..<br/>As the deal is painfully short of anything I will vote Leave</p>

<p>Well done!</p>

<p>I fail to see what we can get by negotiating that we can't get by leaving. It's a no-brainer: LEAVE!</p>

<p>That is because you spend no time understanding what the positives of a trading block can be.</p>

<p>I do understand a socialist super state, where we suffer mass poor migrants, and instructions how to live from unelected foreigners. That looks very much like a USSR system. This has been masquerading as just a trading club.</p>

<p>“The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.” <br/>Mikhail Gorbachev</p>

<p>Everytime I talk to a STAYer, it's like talking to a flat-earther: absolutely no substance. I see you're no different.</p>

<p>FFS somebody please, please, learn the difference between a "bloc" and a "block"!</p>

<p>So sorry and thank you for pointing out my typo</p>

<p>For whomever missed this bit..<br/>Juncker made a speech announcing that the deal was fair to the UK, fair to the other 27 member states and also fair to the EU Parliament..<br/>Since when is the EU Parliament a separate sovereign entity ? <br/>If you are undecided then vote Leave...<br/>By the way you should vote to leave whether or not you are pro-EU.</p>

<p>Ranging of UKIP candidates for the Regional seats in the Welsh Government elections in May will be decided by UKIP Wales</p>

<p>This is as expected, a combination of climb-down, fudge and failure. Cameron asked for little, and achieved even less. This farce of a renegotiation was appropriately summed up by his shameless and laughable attempt to spin it as a success. The man is more transparent than spring water.</p>

<p>The man is more transparent than spring water..... and just as weak.</p>

<p>Indeed, the question is will any ministers now show strength of character ?</p>

<p>Spring water tastes fresh because it is clean.  Cameron is full of ....</p>

<p>Depends on where the spring is located. If it is surrounded by cattle, it will taste of BS.</p>

<p>I agree that Cameron asked for little and got less, but as I'm fairly happy with the status quo that doesn't bother me very much.<br/>However, I think that your use of 'spring water' to describe Cameron is particularly apt as much spring water is tainted with rat and carries Lyme disease. (EDIT. corrected to Weil's disease, thanks to a poster.)<br/>Have a nice day.</p>

<p>The wonderful thing about the DT comments page is that it allows the ill informed and bitter - such as yourself - to comment.</p>

<p>Thank you.<br/>I stand corrected.<br/>I meant Weil's disease.</p>

<p>You also.</p>

<p>The question is, after having achieved absolutely nothing this time, will he be able to go back for another try? It is noticeable that his former ally Merkel has had to keep a very low profile (I wonder why?) and will now be no help to him again.</p>

<p>I suspect the Fat Frau will quite soon be history .</p>

<p>And living in South America!</p>

<p>A pal of mine works a lot in Germany, they want to see her strung up!</p>

<p>Only amazed it is taking so long .</p>

<p>by and large the british people prefer the status quo.<br/>most people have never known a time when we were not in the EU and leaving would be a leap into the unknown. i suspect that this deal - however second rate it may be - will be enough and when it comes to the crunch they will stick with what they are used to warts and all.</p>

<p>How desperately sad.</p>

<p>I prefer to believe my compatriots are more intellectual and discerning than that.</p>

<p>The whole point of the EU is a United Sates of Europe.Those who state they are happy with the status quo are being a bit naive.<br/>Remember that if you cannot get rid of those who govern you then you are not living in a democratic system and that will be the case with a 'Remain In' victory.It won't be the status quo.</p>

<p>a USE is a long way off. lets deal with things as they are now.</p>

<p>Aww Bless, no worries, those with life experience will see them through, the poor dears.</p>

<p>i have no idea what that is supposed to mean and i doubt whether you do either.</p>

<p>The British people that you apparently speak for, failed comprehension at school did we?</p>

<p>i am not speaking for anyone. i am expressing an opinion.</p>

<p>I think that your first sentence is correct.<br/>But I voted to join the Common Market in 1975 and have never regretted it.</p>

<p>We are a nation of head in the sand , turn on the telly sheep .</p>

<p>As Lenin said, there can never be a revolution in Britain, if you told the mob to occupy the railway station you would find them queing for a platform ticket !</p>

<p>Right, David Hussein Qu'ameron after that performance put your papers in!</p>

<p>I suspect the men in the shadows are discussing Camerons departure from No10 right now .</p>

<p>Don't the men in the shadows share his pro EU agenda?</p>

<p>Probably , but they wont be impressed by his lack of bargaining power .</p>

<p>'said the Prime Minister's 'renegotiation' did not go far enough'</p>

<p>What renegotiation??</p>

<p>As far as I can see he has renegotiated nothing  other than if he can get  half the EU countries to agree that mass migration is putting an intolerable Burdon on the UK and that our services are suffering excessive strain he can put some minor restrictions on working tax credits</p>

<p>Probably the one where Cameron pleads to keep his job later this year .</p>

<p>Cameron renegotiation . I imagine him standing in front of a scowling panel of judges , staring at his feet and mumbling , please sir , may I have some more ? To which one of them growls , no , go away .</p>

<p>Dead right, if you read the small print there is no deal!</p>

<p>Dubbing it a farce, a joke and a delusion - Britain's largely eurosceptic press ripped into a deal to keep the country in the European Union on Wednesday, accusing Prime Minister David Cameron of selling out.</p>

<p>Britain's most popular newspaper, the Sun, did not mince its words, describing the deal Cameron threw his weight behind on Tuesday as "a stinking pile of manure".....etc</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>And what of all those Polish workers who did a week or two in the Uk, qualified for unemployment benefits which continue to be paid to them by the Uk even after they have gone back to Poland where they can live a good deal better than before. I note that the possible agreement to scale payments according to the country of origin standards applies only to child allowances...<br/>I'm pretty sure we would find that any child allowances in some countries is better than none if they expected their own state to pay. <br/>And what of their contributions made in their home states? do we not get to draw on them?<br/>On health, we now have changes that count against Brits abroad. This is not a level playing field despite the "harmonised" ambitions of the EU</p>

<p>You can't claim Job Seekers Allowance outside the UK because that wouldn't comply with your 'Claimants Commitments', you also wouldn't be able to demonstrate you were actively seeking work.</p>

<p>Such minor considerations appear not to be a barrier to the payments being made.</p>

<p>And you have evidence, I suppose, of such payments?</p>

<p>here is a quote from the article (<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11124256/UK-embroiled-in-welfare-row-over-European-migrants.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...</a> ) in Sept:</p>

<p>"Under EU rules the UK—as the last state of employment--is obliged to <br/>contribute to the unemployment benefits of jobless Czechs, Slovaks and <br/>Poles who once worked and paid tax in Britain."</p>

<p>Again the report does not say if this is more universal and not simply applied to workers from these countries able to claim benefits from the UK..... but that's modern journalism for you.</p>

<p>PS note the wording - which may just be poor journalism - which says the <br/>"European Union loophole to continue claiming Jobseeker's Allowance from Britain" <br/>but does not say any other workers in other countries can do the same e.g. claim unemployment benefits from France when back in the UK for example. <br/>I am tempted, if I assume good journalism I(not a good assumption, I know) that this just applies to the UK benefits system i.e. an example of the asymmetric rules which work against us so often...... time for Cameron to embrace harmonisation if that is the case?</p>

<p>Just use google and your memory.<br/>IDS was getting all hot and bothered about this and being threatened by the EU for delaying/failing to he necessary payments and this was only last year. He didn't seem to get much support from Cameron or Osborne on this but that's only to be expected.<br/>This sorry saga goes back a long way as this 2008 story suggests <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/3381173/Returning-Polish-workers-encouraged-to-keep-claiming-British-benefits.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fin...</a> <br/>back in 2008: <br/>"They are hosting special meetings to explain to them that rather than signing on for Polish unemployment benefit, which pays just £120 a month, they should use a European Union loophole to continue claiming Jobseeker's Allowance from Britain at a rate of <br/>about £260 a month."</p>

<p>The rules allow any European worker who is already claiming unemployment benefit in Britain to continue receiving it for three months after they move elsewhere, earning them almost £800."<br/>I doubt the situation has improved, probably gotten worse.</p>

<p>But it illustrates the comparative rates quite well and the substance. I admit I didn't recall there was a three month limit which I assume is still in place - but maybe not.... a quick return to the Uk and back again? (Think of all those Irish cows crossing the border by day to claim subsidies and back again at night ready fro a repeat performance the next day...)</p>

<p>But obviously a lot of dosh, our dosh, under the bridge since then......</p>

<p>In fact Poland receives almost all of the UK's net contribution, do the words milch and cow spring to mind?</p>

<p>Remember at the beginning of May we can make our displeasure known  in the various  elections  taking place. Most are  local elections but in Scotland , Wales &amp; NI they will be voting for a new government. From Memory Wales &amp; Scotland use a two member form of PR and NI STV<br/>In Wales it is very likely that Labour will lose power. UKIP could win several of the 60 seats</p>

<p>I have never seen the normally hectoring pompous Cameron look so unsure , he cant even convince himself that this pathetic mish mash of a deal is worth anything at all . Still , it wont stop him and a band of jobsworth MPs flogging it to the public if they can .</p>

<p>He did not have the guts to inform the House of Commons first.  He went to a German owned factory where he would not be heckled.   Even there, some workers said afterwards that they were not convinced.</p>

<p>I still believe the only way out of the EU is via civil war.<br/>Even if the result is 70% in favour or Brexit Cameron and his EU bosses will never accept it. Like Ireland there will be more negotiations, renogotiations, more referendums until the EU get in IN vote they want...and then take it all back again.</p>

<p>We need a guarantee that if the people vote in favour of Brexit this is what will be unconditionally delivered.</p>

<p>Of course we will not be allowed out.<br/>The "clear and decisive vote" ploy will declare that the actual vote plus 10% constitutes a clear and decisive vote and thus we will stay in and have another referendum in 5-10 years. Likewise, it won';t be because we want to actually leave but because we want a better deal than Cameron got (which is one reason he didn't set his sights too high nor draw any lines in the sand) so he'll keep us in while he negotiates for better terms. <br/>Then he has the "its in our best interests" excuses by the boat load to deploy.</p>

<p>We can be forgiven for thinking the referendum, if and when it happens, is little more than an opinion poll or "customer survey" as there is no binding legislation on what parliament has to do when it gets an unfavourable referendum result..... unlike in Switzerland..... and of course, the EU has a standard procedure for dealing with unfavourable referendums with which cameron is fully familiar. Just rename a few few things and make us take it again and again and while we are at it we will stay in.</p>

<p>Cameron was hoping to get the Referendum out of the way before the summer when the migrant numbers will surge even higher and more crime and violence will  have occurred as well</p>

<p>Unfortunately as someone living in France I have no option but to vote to stay in.  The reason why? a) We have no idea what our status would be if we come out.  The information we have is woefully inadequate.  b) our pensions would inevitably be frozen and our access to any health system would ondoubtedly become more expensive.</p>

<p>Apply for French citizenship. I'm sure they'd be delighted to accept you.</p>

<p>My French isn't good enough - and won't be for sometime yet.  It's a difficult language to be fluent in.</p>

<p>Even if or when we leave the EU, I'm sure people like you will have nothing to worry about and the same applies to Europeans working and living in Britain. The one's who should worry are the foreign criminals and spongers.</p>

<p>Your status is clear and is covered by International law  you will be allowed to stay in France. The EU has nothing to do with the EU. Your access to the French health system will be unchanged</p>

<p>Your choice to go and live in France.  We did not choose to be in the EU.</p>

<p>why would your pension be frozen?? and why would health be more expensive???</p>

<p>If you live outside the EU your pension is frozen at the rate set at the time you leave the UK.  If there's no EU then I'm living in a foreign country and my pension will no longer be eligible for the annual increases.  As to health cover, at present there is a reciprocal arrangement between EU member states.  Presumably that will no longer apply if we come out of Europe.</p>

<p>You may not have noticed by the health care provisions have deteriorated over the last couple of years and will continue to do so.</p>

<p>Oh boy the EUrotrolls are struggling today!</p>

<p>They have to try though their income depends on it...</p>

<p>There is zero need for a political union. We just need a trade block. Trying to have a political union between countries with vastly different economic  and living standards and benefits and tax and health systems can never work. There will always be a vast pull from the poorer EU countries to the richer EU countries. This  can never work in the long term. It can only ever  have one result. Massive strain and costs on the richer EU countries which without any check will reduce the wealth of the richer countries down to the living standard of the poorer EU countries as well as the benefits and health systems being dragged down<br/>Will the UK be conned into voting to stay in this failing organisation?</p>

<p>I think a "bloc" would be better than a "block" don't you?</p>

<p>yes, if your head is to be on it.</p>

<p>A Freudian slip I reckon</p>

<p>Not really Bloc is just an abbreviated form of Block</p>

<p>Not at all.<br/>In the context of the sentence, 'We just need a trade block.' it's most likely that it means erecting economic barriers in order to apply pressure.</p>

<p>EU = Undemocratic one size fits all compromise.</p>

<p>You can tweek it for a little bit more of this or a little bit less of that. But that's all it can ever be by definition.</p>

<p>There's no need for the Austrians, the Flemish, the Maltese, the Cypriots, the Croatians, the Estonians, the Germans, the Portuguese, the Spanish [though they like our fish oh don't they just], the Slovakians, the Slovenians, the Danish, the Dutch, the French, the Lithuanians, the Italians, the Irish, the Romanians, the Finnish, the Czechs, the Latvians, the Greeks, the Polish, the Bulgarians, the Hungarians, the Lithuanians, the Croats, the Swedes, etc etc...<br/>...to tell us how to run our country and no need for us to tell them how to run theirs.</p>

<p>I'm sure we can all actually get along better outside the EU dictatorship where we can respect each others wishes much better.</p>

<p>It's called nationstate democracy and here's how it's been given away &gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/uyBr9RNx4k0" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/uyBr9RNx4k0</a></p>

<p>As most EU legislation is designed to mug us for the benefit of others, it is not very likely that Cameron would ever be able to use his red card.  The level of child benefit to be determined by level of benefit in the other countries... a nightmare for the Department of Work and Pensions.  But before the level of benefit is considered, will they send inspectors to those countries to verify that the children exist at all?  We pay child benefit to fraudsters in this country  often enough without checking.    How do we know if the Romanian roofer is telling the truth when he says he left nine children at home?</p>

<p>The whole thing is laughable. I would have some respect for Cameron if he told us:  I did my best, it is not very good, but that is the best we can hope for.   Instead he tells us that the conditions offered are SO good, he would sure want to join, if we were not already members of the EU!</p>

<p>and besides, the EU is intent on harmonising things so that the level of child care would end up the same... for those that get it. It isn't the payments that need adjusting but the qualifying conditions - which probably why they presented this scam to Cameron.</p>

<p>These comment pages are like the attic where UKIP keeps people who are just too barking mad even for them, so it's no wonder that they're not satisfied with the deal.<br/>Nothing would convince them to stay in the EU.</p>

<p>Are you suggesting that UKIP have an attic where they keep people?<br/>It looks like you escaped.<br/>You are very lucky to have Wifi in your ward.</p>

<p>Allow me to introduce you to the word 'metaphor'.</p>

<p>Late for school again ?</p>

<p>Happiest days of your life.<br/>I'd love to go back in time and have just one day of grammar school again.</p>

<p>Why don't you try and persuade all of us here of the merits of why we should stay in the EU?<br/>Please provide your reasoning behind why you believe Cameron has got the UK a good deal.</p>

<p>I don't think that Cameron has achieved anything very much at all in these dealings, but I didn't need him to. I'm happy to stay in the EU and work for reform within it. On the whole it's pretty good as it is.<br/>If you want to make a change to the status quo, then I think it's up to you to make a case.</p>

<p>Sadly, if, even with the "big stick" of an impending referendum Cameron achieved virtually nothing, then you will have to show how we are supposed to have any influence in the EU. We never have had and never will have. We are what DeGaulle called "the trimmings" when he said the EU was France and Germany and the rest were just the trimmings. <br/>When the referendum is over and done with the EU will take even less notice of what the UK wants.</p>

<p>Its pretty good as it is???? Yeah tell that to all the women who are being abused and assaulted by the gimmegrants they have  allowed in....</p>

<p>There are more examples but that one ought to be enough....</p>

<p>I think it I where the EU keep barking mad people like you</p>

<p>You regularly take part and post comments on 'these pages'.. I didn't know you represent UKIP, but I always thought you are barking mad.</p>

<p>As you know, I don't represent UKIP. As for being barking mad, I don't think that that's for me to decide. The mad often think themselves the most sane, so I'll stand by the judgement of those qualified to decide.</p>

<p>Ok, I declare myself qualified and, sad to say, you are at the least deluded if you think the Eu is pretty good as it is. But worse still, there is no status quo. The EU is a moving target continually evolving toward ever closer union, toward a single state with all that entails. So even if you like what we have now can you be sure you will like what the EU becomes?<br/>I'd say to get out now and wait and see the finished project before we decide to join. <br/>Mad? maybe.</p>

<p>Having little or no control over your borders is barking mad.</p>

<p>And with very good reason. What, pray is wrong with sovereignty, independence and in particular with democracy. You won't get much of them from the unelected elite in Brussels. None if they can help it.</p>

<p>So having the country largely ruled by foreigners is fine by you?</p>

<p>Er.....what deal? I see no deal!</p>

<p>You may want to review and edit this comment<br/>You seem to have leaned on the keyboard and accidentally pressed a couple of keys, and it makes you look like a moron.<br/>Happy to help.</p>

<p>What deal do enlighten us...</p>

<p>A 'deal' where 14 other countries have to agree with Britain is not a 'red card' deal.</p>

<p>No problem, you lot have already decided I'm a moron, because I'm an engineer who votes UKIP, I meekly accept my destiny!</p>

<p>It ought to be said that, as every marketing guru knows, while most people make most decisions based on impulse and emotion, engineers are renowned for only making decisions based on logic reason and all the data they can get hold of.<br/>This is because most people rely on their primitive brain stem for decisions, the bit responsible for the "fight or flight" choices which use the precautionary principle and decides based in minimal input while engineers use the modern thinking brain. <br/>I think you ought to credit Yachtsman with knowing what he is talking about.<br/>:)</p>

<p>Sorry, forgot to mention the engineer's best friend - a spreadsheet with lots of complex visual basic .....</p>

<p>I've been away overnight, so please forgive a late reply.<br/>The cobbler should stick to his last.<br/>If I want a bridge building, I'll consult an engineer. If I want a political analysis, I'll leave him to his pencil.</p>

<p>And the qualifications needed to vote?</p>

<p>Come on Boris, climb off the fence and join the OUT campaign, when we get out the job'll be yours for the taking!</p>

<p>Oh God no, not that comedian. We want a leader who has real eloquence, a good nature, humorous, polite, who answers questions put to him and knows his subject backwards and knows the needs of the nation. Oh and tells it how it is. Now who does that remind me of....?</p>

<p>Boris 'I love mass immigration' Johnson.</p>

<p>Hmmm.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10404421/Boris-I-am-the-only-British-politician-who-will-admit-to-being-pro-immigration.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...</a></p>

<p>The 1975 referendum was a sham, the 2005 deal re the exchange of a large chunk of our rebate for reform of the CAP was a sham and twice we were promised a referendum - both sham promises. This referendum was only forced out of Cameron because Ukip were attracting too much support. "But", said DC, "never mind we'll cobble something together to fool the people. Concessions can always be reversed - nothing new in that". <br/>We are being taken for fools yet again. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty and vote to leave this wretched and corrupt institution.</p>

<p>Cameron must have been told by Donald Tusk not to laugh when selling this deal to the British public.</p>

<p>Doesn't stop him (Tusk) smirking in the background though.</p>

<p>One of the darkest days in British history. A prime minister raising the white flag. A man who turned and ran instead of standing up to the EU bullies. We are led by a coward.</p>

<p>But he never intended to stand up to them, he just wants to be accepted by them.</p>

<p>We need a big beast to lead us out of the EU.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Liam Fox perhaps?</p>

<p>Like Farage immensely and Hoey and Redwood but if Boris could step up and seize the day.......</p>

<p>Not Boris - the man is dangerous</p>

<p>And untrustworthy. Sadly that applies to most of them. Look at Hague, for example.</p>

<p>The trouble is he is a natural born leader and after years (since Thatcher - who admittedly went du-lally towards the end) of weak leadership - the electorate have not seen someone so single-mindedly determined. Instead of recognising his qualities many are put off by what they see as his dictatorial manner. And the BBC just hate that.</p>

<p>Farage has told the truth ALL the time, about EVERYTHING, it is an absolute disgrace that the MSM are hell bent on shutting him out!</p>

<p>Remember that debate with Clegg where he accused Nigel of being wrong on everything., Nigel has been proven to be correct on everything he said and Clegg has been proved to be wrong in fact in many cases Clegg just blatantly lied</p>

<p>The man's an inveterate liar.</p>

<p>Examples please. And to prove your point one will certainly not do. If you can't list 'em your point (lie) says more about you than it does about your obvious pet hate.</p>

<p>The unresignation. The 'foul play' story. That he had his kids with him when he ran away from some women in fancy dress.</p>

<p>Hey lads! a new one!</p>

<p>You are referring to Cameron I take it ?</p>

<p>Of course. How silly of me!</p>

<p>Does this mean an end of Cameron's attempts to give away the birthright of Britons as yet unborn?</p>

<p>A rope and lamp post is too good for him.</p>

<p>But first we would have to get 14 other nations to choose a lamp post .</p>

<p>Maybe we could economise and use the same rope and lamppost for Merkel (that's what the German public want to do)</p>

<p>Along with that pr@t Damian Green currently touring the studios trying to sell us out to the EU and the multinationals.<br/>Personally I would prefer heads on spikes.</p>

<p>A win for the Remain campaign will mean full steam ahead for full EU integration as this and subsequent Governments will have a mandate to join:- the Euro,Schengen, a Euro Army,Navy and Airforce,a fully integrated EU tax system et al.<br/>Therefore it will be a lot safer to leave than to remain.</p>

<p>Also TTIP and whatever horrors that will bring to our benighted island.</p>

<p>And with a bit of luck a win for the OUT campaign will bring the whole stinking edifice crashing down!</p>

<p>Only yesterday morning the DT ran a propaganda piece headed 'The Eurosceptics are running out of time.'</p>

<p>Well, it only took Dave until lunchtime to shoot both his feet off.</p>

<p>Now it's 'Remain' who are sinking without trace - just look at this morning's front pages.</p>

<p>I really don't see why there is so much abuse for Cameron. If that's all the Eurocrats will give then if the UK do vote to leave then it will be on their own heads. I am of the view that they have far more to lose than we do. And I would hardly say Cameron is any kind of Eurofanatic. I think he will face the referendum with some equanimity.</p>

<p>The criticism is because he asked for little and got even less and he is over the moon about it. He is a wimp and a coward. His first and ONLY concern is the EU and remaining part of it.</p>

<p>I don't agree, sorry. Cameron is no Heseltine like fanatic.</p>

<p>      “Politics is the art of the possible, the attainable — the art of the next best”</p>

<p>  ―<br/>    Otto von Bismarck</p>

<p>I'm quite sure Cameron was well aware of this truism and he felt something to be better than nothing. That he has not even achieved his fairly minimal requests says far more about the intransigence (and stupidity) of the EU than it does about Cameron. Just so you know, I will now be voting to leave.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>No Polly. Just a rather more rational individual than you are. But I'm quite sure a negotiating team led by yourself would have resulted in an overwhelming triumph.</p>

<p>With an elderly population needing more care, Cancer suffers needing expensive drugs, increased care in the community to release hospital beds for A &amp; E use. The list of urgent needs is huge.</p>

<p>Cameron would sooner poor cash into his pals in the EU (remember the auditors have refused to sign off EU books for 18 years.</p>

<p>If you want improved health care and better infrastructure they only way is to Vote for OUT. </p>

<p>Your public opinion?</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>'to the Beano' I think was your intention. Do not confuse a few hundred yowling anti EU cats on a thread with the opinion of the electorate. That's the mistake the Corbynauts make.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Wasn't the general election more recent, with more people voting?</p>

<p>There's more of us than your lot, so what does that tell you?</p>

<p>I think you mistake my intentions. I was in the 'wait and see what he brings back' camp. Having seen, I will vote for leaving.</p>

<p>Excellent - good man!</p>

<p>Pretty pathetic isn't it? This will not be just a vote on Britain staying or leaving. It is a vote on the continuation of the EU and you would think the Eurocrats would realise that. Without us the EU is on the road to collapse.</p>

<p>I think the EU is on the road to collapse with or without us. It will take longer if we stay, but being dragged down by a collapsing EU will cause enormous damage to the UK.</p>

<p>I agree. And you would think they would be rather desperate for us not to leave which will hasten that collapse. Apparently not. So be it. Reminds me of this very famous WW2 cartoon:<br/><a href="https://www.google.com.ua/search?q=Alone+then+cartoon&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjruMaRqtvKAhXn8XIKHRXrCjwQsAQIGg&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=766#imgrc=-cq83UJ55svgpM%3A" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com.ua/sear...</a></p>

<p>Who do you think you are kidding Mr Cameron</p>

<p>Copyright The Sun</p>

<p>Comrade Dave (certified Apparatchik) is looking for a job in 2020 as President of the EU's Department of Delusion, Lies and Deceit. He's well qualified.</p>

<p>Cameron is the laughing stock of the country, the EU and the whole world this morning.</p>

<p>Dave is full of enthusiasm for Britain to be abolished and run as an EU province.</p>

<p>Vote Leave !</p>

<p>Given his sterling performances in the EU chamber, Farage should stand as a Conservative candidate in a safe seat - and replace Cameron as Leader of the Tories - as PM he would at least be fighting for the UK - not bending over and gripping his ankles for Juncker.</p>

<p>Interesting point. He tried standing for parliament, but the Electoral Commission decided that the gross over-spend by the Tory candidate to keep him out of parliament was quite permissible despite breaking the law.</p>

<p>Farage will likely LOSE you the referendum!</p>

<p>Farage GOT us the referendum.</p>

<p>Nigel got us the referendum, and 'Leave' leads by 4% according to YouGov last weekend.</p>

<p>His work his done, and serious minded "Leavers" don't want him anywhere near the campaign  Why is that do you suppose?</p>

<p>Nonsense. I was at the Grassroots launch a couple of weeks ago with Kate Hoey, Nigel Farage and Liam Fox and if Labour chooses to share the stage with Nigel...</p>

<p>Read Fraser Nelson's piece today.</p>

<p>A paid DT propagandist, have they sacked all the real journalists?</p>

<p>'serious minded "Leavers" don't want him anywhere near the campaign'<br/>So who are these serious minded people? By denifintion it excludes Trolls such as you.</p>

<p>Go back to Brussels!</p>

<p>It's 'heir to Blair' Dave's 'rebranding' scam.<br/>There is nothing here to address the undemocratic and anti-sovereignty basis of the  EU's operation.</p>

<p>Out of 28 member nations<br/>only FIVE are net contributors - THE REST ARE SUPPLICANTS...<br/>...and out of that FIVE ....THREE are currently going bust due to the insane 'one currency'/federalisation dogma of the unelected EU 'Elite'...</p>

<p>...and , if we LEAVE...haha....omg !...</p>

<p>so:</p>

<p>There is a 2 year 'negotiation period' following a vote to LEAVE.</p>

<p>Vote OUT - if you want to leave</p>

<p>Vote OUT - if you want to stay - in a REFORMED EU</p>

<p>Vote IN - if you want NO CHANGE and be cannon fodder for an unelected nepotistic bunch of submarxist/corporatists...</p>

<p>- because, once they see an OUT Vote from the UK, and the SUPPLICANTS see an empty bread basket looming,<br/>this will focus their minds wonderfully on grabbing the unelected EU 'Elite' by the balls and squeezing HARD<br/>to give Britain ALL the concessions it has asked for ...and more...<br/>...in fact they will BEG us to stay - especially Germany, which is faced with having to pick up the tab for the whole bunch of teat suckers if we leave !...haha...</p>

<p>THERE IS NOTHING TO LOSE BY VOTING OUT</p>

<p>Cameron should not even be negotiating on behalf of us, as is only interest is staying in the EU.</p>

<p>He isn't!</p>

<p>In the end, the EU will make European unorthodoxy and anti EU thought crime literally impossible, because they will withdraw the words required to express it.</p>

<p>Every concept and human interaction which could possibly be required will be rigidly controlled with meaning precisely defined by EU rules and all non approved alternatives extinguished and soon forgotten. The process will still be continuing long after the British pro EU faux referendum is nothing more than ancient history.</p>

<p>Every year fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little smaller.</p>

<p>Even now, of course, according to some senior EU officials, there is no reason or excuse for having anti EU thoughts. It is merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control.</p>

<p>But eventually there won't be any need even for that, because through double speak and newthink, the EU will effectively enter our minds to prevent it and control us all..</p>

<p>No doubt we will all be forced to speak German as well in your brave new world...  Or is Esperanto set for a comeback?</p>

<p>The European Commission has announced that, in order to streamline EU communications and meetings, English will now be officially phased out in favour of EU Germolish..</p>

<p>The consequences for the English language are as follows..</p>

<p>In the first year, "s" will replace the soft "c" as in sivil servants. The hard "c" will be dropped in favour of the "k", which should klear up some konfusion and allow one key less on keyboards.</p>

<p>There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when the troublesome "ph" will be replaced with "f", making words like "fotograf" 20% shorter.</p>

<p>In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling.</p>

<p>Also, al wil agre that the horible silent "e", as in disgrasful, should be removed.</p>

<p>By the fourth year, the publik wil be reseptiv to steps such as kompletely replasing "th" with "z" and "w" with "v".</p>

<p>During ze fifz yer, ze unesesary "o" kan be dropd from vords kontaining "ou", such as you, and similar changes vud of kurs be aplid to ozer kombinations of leters. After zis fifz yer, ve vil hav a reli sensibl riten styl! Zer vil be no mor trubls or difikultis and everivun vil find it ezi to understand ech ozer.</p>

<p>Finaly Ze Drem Vil Kom Tru !</p>

<p>Brilliant. Well done.</p>

<p>Cameron has shown Sam how to water down even the thinnest gruel.</p>

<p>Cameron is showing all the classic signs of losing touch with the voters.</p>

<p>The voters want an end to open door immigration<br/>----------- “I believe that will mean net migration to this country will be in the order of tens of thousands each year, not the hundreds of thousands every year that we have seen over the last decade.''<br/>Europhile David Cameron, April 2011.</p>

<p>The voters want an end to the Islamisation of the UK<br/>----------- “Britain will always be open to the best and brightest from around the world and those fleeing persecution. But with us, our borders will be under control and immigration will be at levels our country can manage. No ifs. No buts. That’s a promise we made to the British people, and it’s a promise we are keeping.”<br/>Dhimmy David Cameron, April 2011.</p>

<p>The voters want control of the borders to remain in the UK<br/>----------- ''I believe in a Federal Europe, says Europhile Cameron.<br/>Everytime he goes to Europe.</p>

<p>Dave wants Britain to be renamed EU Sector North West..</p>

<p>The coming referendum will be the one chance British voters have to regain British independence as a sovereign nation.  Otherwise, Britain will continue for the foreseeable future as a province of the EU ruled by Brussels.  What a comedown for a once great nation.</p>

<p>Obviously Dave is a high kipper keen for loads of former Conservatives to head over to UKIP..</p>

<p>He must be Nigel's latest catch.</p>

<p>I am sure that UKIP is in discussions with Conservative MP's  as to cooperating  in the next election</p>

<p>The next election will be too late.</p>

<p>IF there is one, if we stay in the EU that is not certain!</p>

<p>An emergency brake that we cannot use ourselves but which is in the hands of our "friends" on the Continent.</p>

<p>If the normal brakes are so broken that we need an emergency brake, then obviously the whole EU vehicle is decrepit and should be sent to the scrap heap.</p>

<p>An emergency break that's not an emergency break. No mention of the fine print neither. The bar is set so high it will be almost impossible to use it in any case. First we have to prove the number of migrants is too high to manage now given the EU keep saying we can easily take another 100,000 so called refuges a year I can see them  voting with us on that. The second test is that it is putting an impossible strain on our services. I don't see them accepting that neither</p>

<p>Give us a "brake" Bill!....but you're dead right.</p>

<p>Cabinet Ministers must be suffering 2nd hand embarrassment as they read the papers over their cornflakes this morning.Cameron is delusional if he thinks he has achieved anything but failure from the re negotiation farce.Only he wanted a renegotiation.Not the electorate.<br/>Eurosceptic Conservative voters must be questioning their loyalty to the party and looking at UKIP as the only alternative.We will find out in the local elections in May 2016.</p>

<p>Delusional Dave.</p>

<p>Getting to be as bad as Communist Corbyn, Edstone Miliband, Fiscal Incompetent Brown and Weapons of Mass Destruction lies to parliament illegal War Criminal Blair.</p>

<p>We seem to recently have had the worst Prime Ministers and Labour Party oddballs in the last 60 years.</p>

<p>There now follow the biggest lies in history on behalf of the Conservative Party..</p>

<p>"There are some in this country who fear that in going into Europe we shall in some way sacrifice independence and sovereignty. These fears, I need hardly say, are completely unjustified." Edward Heath.</p>

<p>'This deal is good for Britain' David Cameron.</p>

<p>Liars, both of them..</p>

<p>Sailorboy Heath and his predilection for young men - the worst PM we have had since Harold Wilson.</p>

<p>The ridiculous Cameron reached his career ceiling as a PR puffball for Carlton TV.</p>

<p>He was certainly never PM material.</p>

<p>A fluffy useless PR merchant who thinks he is far better than the useless object he is</p>

<p>Presenting this pathetic charade as a victory should convince the undecided what the rest of us have known since he became P.M., he is just not up to the job, he never was.</p>

<p>Reject the E.U., and reject him.</p>

<p>That what PR people do. Damage limitation</p>

<p>A genlteman's agreement is binding in honour only - so this deal fails on both counts then.</p>

<p>It's as simple as this: if we would just LEAVE there would be no need for this negotiation pantomime, we'd have EVERYTHING we want, including our country back.</p>

<p>This is Cameron's idea of a "reformed" EU? Cue hollow laughter.<br/>I'll be voting LEAVE to escape the blasted EU.</p>

<p>Not only Telegraph readers who reject Cameron's 'non deal'. Absolutely nothing promised by him has been achieved.</p>

<p>None of these things have been secured. The first three of your pleas have to be agreed by the EU each and every time – The ‘red card’ must be backed by at least 16 other states and only then will it be ‘discussed’, not acceded to. Add to that QMV, which the majority of Brits have never heard of, let alone understand, and you will see that Tusk, Merkel’s lackey, is making a monkey of you and the EU(SSR) are laughing at you, and us. What you have is a piece of paper no more substantial than that which Chamberlain waved at Heston Aerodrome when ‘Mr Hitler’ made a fool out of him. What you have does not amount to a row of beans. It comes nowhere close to what we want – in short – pathetic! Stop acting like Quisling – get us OUT NOW before the EU collapses in a pile of dust (not far off now). We want our country back!</p>

<p>Cameron is demonstrating some of the behavioural traits of a sociopath. Pathological lying, in denial, and devoid of conscience. Any reasonable, rational person would have been at the very least, exasperated with the shabbiness of the "deal". Not Dave, he's "cock-a-hoop" according to a Downing Street source.</p>

<p>This whole nonsense is to fool the British people and have us continue with the status quo towards the plan, clearly laid out in "The Five Presidents" report. Does Cameron really believe (or expect us to believe) he will get backing on various issues from 14 other heads of state? We are the most outvoted member of the EU. Does he really believe this silly "Emergency Brake" idiocy will reduce immigration? The example shown on the BBC last night explained that we offer the third highest minimum pay in the EU - more than six times higher than Romania. No wonder eastern Europe is is emptying out of its' unskilled workers. When the "New Living Wage" is implemented shortly, more immigrants will pour in.</p>

<p>And of course, the strain on The Ministry of Work and Pensions to develop computer programmes (let alone the cost) that will cope with the differences in Child Benefit systems of 27 other nations.will mean that the effort to stop (in this case reduce) payments being sent from the UK to worker's children back in their home country, won't happen for anything like the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Cameron is as much a traitor as Guy Fawkes. Roll on bonfire night..</p>

<p>Mission creep.<br/>The EU can and does give new powers to itself to continually increase its control. There can be nothing to stop the EU cancelling out any slight provisions the UK has as a majority vote will leave the UK in a minority of one.</p>
