<p>Janet, no arguments please.</p>

<p>The Polling Companies get EU subsidies which they desperately need.</p>

<p>If they predict the wrong things - well it could jeopardise their payments.</p>

<p>Interesting that most of the newspapers do their own polling - just because the Polling Companies are - let's be kind and say, "Not reliable witnesses".</p>

<p>Interesting too that the newspaper Polls show the OUT of the EU running at 60 - 90%.</p>

<p>Why even the Daily Telegraph's poll shows nearly 90% in favour of OUT.</p>

<p>Does that make the DT (in EUSpeak) "Populist, extreme-right wing people?"</p>

<p>Ironic that Janet Daley is criticising those who predict election results after her spurious belief that Mitt Romney was going to win the White House last time.</p>

<p>Civis Britannicus sum. <br/>We need out of the EU s**t. Mr Camoron, you are disgraceful, begging before the GermanSS and their servants ? We are Great Britain. We have made history and we shall make it again, without you.</p>

<p>You sound entirely normal.</p>

<p>The UK has been outvoted every single time it has voted against the EU laws.</p>

<p>This has cost British taxpayers £2.4 billion.</p>

<p>We have no influence whatsoever.</p>

<p>You get benefits because the Empire. The disaster is that morons like you get benefits for doing nothing.</p>

<p>Poland are demanding £10 million from us to pay Polish jobseekers.</p>

<p>What a bunch of scroungers.</p>

<p>Who is "us"?</p>

<p>No, you just made that up.</p>

<p>Who are you addressing?</p>

<p>The scroungers.</p>

<p>Ah of course. How silly of me.</p>

<p>As far as I was able to judge it, some Tory voters who had supported UKIP in local and European elections reluctantly decided to vote Tory at the last moment. Lynton Crosby's tactics of fear worked excellently for Cameron.<br/>The same may happen with the referendum. The elderly in particular can succumb to worry. Also they are a generation with a considerable regard for loyalty. Tory agents play on that.</p>

<p>Doing an British opinion poll on Merkel would give a more accurate result on the upcoming referendum.</p>

<p>I doubt many Brits know who she is. Or else view her as a former enemy.</p>

<p>Postal voting in any election or referendum is not to be trusted.</p>

<p>Expats will be voting by post.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8655697.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_...</a><br/>.<br/>So will they.</p>

<p>British citizens living abroad? Yes, we've covered that.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that those who want out will be determined to show up on voting day. I'm hoping those who wish to remain won't be so bothered to vote.</p>

<p>I also refuse to trust the polls.  I trust Cameron even less.</p>

<p>More, I don't even trust the Electoral Commission on this one.  Is postal voting to be allowed?</p>

<p>One thing we can be certain of, is that the establishment will do anything, no matter how dishonest, to keep us in the rotten, corrupt EU.</p>

<p>The establishment doesn't need to do anything; the people want to stay, despite all the protestations of UKIP and their ilk.</p>

<p>If you are right Mr Blobby, then it is important for the Remain voters to stay at home on Referendum Day, because they ARE voting for the status quo - which needs no support.</p>

<p>Yes. 'Expats' - Britain's version of immigrants are allowed to vote by post dependent on a few conditions being met.</p>

<p>Expats, are generally either working and paying tax or retired and paying tax.  They also tend to believe in the principle of "when in Rome do as the Romans do".</p>

<p>I suppose so. I am one. But they are immigrants too, as am I. Or should I just say 'the I word'?</p>

<p>Why is it rotten? Why is it corrupt? do you have proof?</p>

<p>About as much as Nigel Farage!</p>

<p>You are right. The establishment needs dismantling.</p>

<p>Perhaps the establishment needs dismantling.. Though, since the establishment consists of such as Mr Cameron, BBC types and Guardian reading judiciary, it would have to be done by conservatives, something which, by their nature, they are loath to do.</p>

<p>I sense that Cameron will be responsible for untold violence in this country, what with his spineless attitude to immigration. It's coming, I fear.</p>

<p>Seems that feelings are already rising in some parts of the world.</p>

<p>What a disaster the EU Empire has been.</p>

<p>You get benefits because the Empire. The disaster is that morons like you get benefits.</p>

<p>No, it has been a success. Partly because it is not an empire,by desogn.</p>

<p>Can one assume that, if the British public vote the 'wrong' way, they will simply be asked to vote again?</p>

<p>Or that parliament, after appropriate consideration and clarification of the issues, would interpret the 'wrong' result as a mandate for further 'renegotiation'?</p>

<p>I do not see how the establishment politicians, who have made so much or hold out the prospect of making so much personal fortune as a result of EU membership, can allow a complete British withdrawal from the EU.</p>

<p>Imagine, a would be future prime minister denied the opportunity to have a fortune the size of, say, Mr Blair's? Inconceivable that Britain should exit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3435093/A-world-divided-Violent-clashes-break-globe-thousands-streets-anti-Islam-protests-organised-far-right-group-PEGIDA.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/new...</a></p>

<p>I go around telling everyone I'm Ukip and watch my friends and family evaporate - think how many more are bashful and don't want to be so forsaken? Good analysis Janet</p>

<p>It is rather that Ukip comes with a lot of bad news and no good news. Ukip have no case, no tenable platform and the lying scaremonger Nigel Farage at its helm</p>

<p>I simply told my Lib Dem neighbour that I was voting for the 'racist xenophobes'. It seemed pragmatic to cut straight to where the conversation was likely going to go. It also seemed to steal his thunder though, he simply responded with "Oh well, fair enough then". Since then I've stuck with that line and it seems to work out just fine.</p>

<p>Never mind UKIP, it's still a bit edgy to say you are a Conservative round these parts.</p>

<p>Alternatively, pollsters 'adjusted' the polls as a mechanism for influencing the vote, but we the leople ignored the manipulation of our intention to vote.</p>

<p>quite promising reading the comments on the Guardian how many appear to be equally frustrated with the EU and the untrustworthy PM.</p>

<p>Even Guardian readers are aware of what is going on!</p>

<p>Guardian is coming back to their senses. No one in their own mind could defend Muslim misoginism, terrorism, terrorism and terrorism.</p>

<p>"Guardian is coming back to their senses"</p>

<p>Many Guardian readers are.<br/>The Guardian itself isn't.</p>

<p>Ukip's online Dads army are well established.</p>

<p>As opposed to a Cretter's  view of the EU utopia.</p>

<p>Who rattled your cage .</p>

<p>Just enjoying myself. The Samaritans were engaged.</p>

<p>Well there is no point in hanging around here as you have nothing worthwhile to contribute ,</p>

<p>Thanks. I'll let you lead the way with your knockdown arguments then.</p>

<p>Stupid boy Pike.</p>

<p>Dad's Army: decent, patriotic men who never ultimately let their - sometimes childish- differences get in the way of their love for their people and country.</p>

<p>Prone to incompetence and farce too, perhaps.</p>

<p>That would be the EU.</p>

<p>"as the children of immigrants become more integrated"</p>

<p>It's far from clear that they even want to do that these days, much less that any members of the potential new wave will do so.</p>

<p>It takes immigrants three generations to integrate, but they do.</p>

<p>It will not be long before, in most schools, the children or grandchildren of immigrants will be in a majority in their demographic cohort.</p>

<p>In such cases, it will be the natives who need 'integrating'.</p>

<p>Well on the way to that situation.</p>

<p>Already 20% of new junior school entrants (4-5 years old?) are Muslim.  We have only one generation left before they take over,<br/>unless Muslim immigration, family reunion, spouse entry, immigrant benefits are all stopped.</p>

<p>Weren't some of the 7/7 bombers second- or third-generation immigrants?</p>

<p>Private jets for the EU criminals so Cameron had to get one as well...</p>

<p>"It's the right thing to do".</p>

<p>Half-wit.</p>

<p>Who are you calling a criminal and why?</p>

<p>That much wit?</p>

<p>Most world leaders use them don't they?</p>

<p>So differentiating oneself from the utterly corrupt and deracinated would seem sensible</p>

<p>If you say so</p>

<p>most likely the polls are in favour of the in campaign so they don't look as bad as they really are. most likely its up to around 70 percent out at the moment.</p>

<p>I wish.</p>

<p>What a great result that would be! Cameron would be toast.</p>

<p>Cameron is toast but which of the muppets would you suggest replace him - I can't think of one any better.</p>

<p>That's a good question. After the vote to exit there is no one capable of seeing it through.</p>

<p>So no one has thought through what will happen if we vote No? Typical tory fudge then?</p>

<p>Enoch Powell said during the 1975 referendum, "the people are being lied to this will not remain just a trading bloc, what they really want is political union." Boy was he spot on.</p>

<p>I was lied to by the cheating tory Heath. I voted for a trading partnership.</p>

<p>You can't have. That was never an option.</p>

<p>That`s how all politicians at the time, and the media put it. I remember the assurances of "no loss of sovereignty" repeated time and again.<br/>I definitely would not have voted "in" otherwise.</p>

<p>As time has gone on the much maligned Enoch Powell has come to be proved right time and time again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/comment/14253041.I_am_concerned_about_the_300_names_on_the__late_postal_voter_list__for_the_Crompton_by_election/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk...</a></p>

<p>As the link above illustrates postal voting has introduced endemic fraud into our elections.<br/>I have no confidence that we will have a fair referendum.</p>

<p>Looks like one of Corbyns rat faced lefties has been done for election fraud......... in Tower Hamlets of all places..</p>

<p>The pollsters are constantly being proved wrong. It is just as likely that they are actually right and the result is wrong due to electoral fraud.</p>

<p>And this?</p>

<p>Cameron and his  cabinet sycophants are no longer relevant to the British people, for CAMERON this is his poll tax, his Iraq, his bigoted woman moment -</p>

<p>1. The EU is unreformable - it is led by elites who dont even pay taxes on their salaries, after this CAMERON charade its now PROVEN they cant and wont change. 28 countries stuck together in some death grip.</p>

<p>2. They are undemocratic - name your MEP , who is it?? What have they done for you in the last 2 years since they were elected??</p>

<p>3. They take 11 billion NET Each and every year of our taxes (equivalent to the entire Scottish Income tax revenue) and spend it on what exactly? Export of our jobs to Eastern European.</p>

<p>4. They have never in the last 20 years had their accounts signed off by auditors, because of the manifest corruption in the organisation.</p>

<p>5. They have treated Greece and Cyprus with contemptuous arrogance.</p>

<p>6; They love Trans Pacific Partnership, Goldman Sachs, Elitism, over independent nations, and elected governments.</p>

<p>7. They despise both our referendum and us.</p>

<p>8. They back David Camerons sham negotiations.</p>

<p>9. They want us to take as many economic migrants as possible, to bail out Merkel in Germany</p>

<p>VOTE LEAVE on 23rd June and give Cameron the black eye, and do ourselves a favour.</p>

<p>Just on your point 3. Do you know what percentage of the UK's budgetary income that represents?</p>

<p>It's about 1.5% - however you know what Mr McAwber said.<br/>It is also about 20% of the money we pay to service our debts.</p>

<p>It's still a pittance out of a budget of 673 Billion. I really don't get what all the fuss is about tbh.</p>

<p>It's also unnecessary. There's an irony in calling soemthing that costs 50 million pounds a day 'free'.</p>

<p>It doesn't cost 50 Million a day though</p>

<p>I`m just annoyed that we can`t comment on the real story, that somehow made it onto the telegraph. The fact that some rich golfers may be priced out of their golf club by richer golfers. I am livid that our debate of this serious issue has been suppressed.</p>

<p>what about this, is it okay?</p>

<p>1 female genital mutilation case reported every 96 minutes in England</p>

<p>Is this okay, time to join Pegida maybe?</p>

<p>... probably more like 96 seconds with that shower.</p>

<p>I've a feeling that not many ordinary voters could give a stuff about these opinion polls and will continue to vote as they wish.<br/>What I find appealing is that Cameron might base his preferred referendum date on wildly inaccurate data and come a cropper.<br/>Couldn't happen to a more deserving excuse for a Prime Minister.</p>

<p>he'll ask Lynton to arrange it.</p>

<p>Is this okay, join Pegida and fight this horror/</p>

<p>Pegida marches across Europe, not one mention of it in the DT. You can pretend the anger doesn't exist, the anger is exploding all of the World, we have had enough.</p>

<p>Yes, it is odd when I have to go to the Mail for information</p>

<p>Even Australia.</p>

<p>those that vote to remain had better have a good explanation for their children and grand children...</p>

<p>those who do vote to remain will believe they are doing it for the best</p>

<p>Whilst those that vote to leave know that they are doing it for the best.</p>

<p>University education in the EU without having to take out a student loan should be a fairly powerful incentive.</p>

<p>How much more shallow can the young of this country get? I guess they don't learn too much history though, so how would they know what it has taken over a thousand years, the struggle time and time again to win and keep freedom? Maybe it just doesn't matter any more, they are becoming Human beings that want to be spoon fed and told what to do, so that they don't have to take responsibility or bother to think about it any more.</p>

<p>That's extraordinarily unfair.</p>

<p>Life is unfair.</p>

<p>The mosques and the imams will explain it all nicely to them.</p>

<p>so long as they accept that Brussele has to replace Mecca.</p>

<p>Do they work for the EU?</p>

<p>A point I made to the reliably idiotic everhardus earlier today. </p>

<p>If just those aged 52 and younger had voted on May 7th, we would now have a Prime Minister Miliband. The older the voter, the more likely they will bother voting, strange when it's not their future ; my main bit of optimism for the EU referendum.</p>

<p>If you don't vote for socialism when you're 20 you've no heart. If you vote for it when you're 40 you have no brain.<br/>Definition of a conservative - a labour supporter whose been run over by reality.</p>

<p><b>If... </b>   those just 52 and <u>OVER</u> had voted, Nigel Farage would be Home Secretary and Cameron would be working as a double glazing salesman!  My main bit of optimism for universal suffrage!</p>

<p>Gideon would be folding towels at The Dorchester, yes I can see it.</p>

<p>Where do you get this stupid information from?</p>

<p>a fact</p>

<p>It is a fact only if you can prove it. Can you?</p>

<p>water under the bridge but it'll be proved again in the referendum (when it comes).</p>

<p>So you don't know. I thought so.</p>

<p>I read it, I believe on this website, I just don't have a link.</p>

<p>It's the future of their children and grandchildren.</p>

<p>If only they were affected, they'd probably tolerate it.</p>

<p>many vote that way possibly, pity they can't get get younger voters in their family feel that way.</p>

<p>For all those, and it appears to be the vast majority of posters <br/>below, who will vote Brexit, please cheer up. We are leaving the EU come<br/> what may and no amount of Europhile (BSE Mad Cow Disease) propaganda <br/>will change this inevitable result.</p>

<p>And why?  Because the vast majority of the voting British public - and particularly the older generation like me - will come out in our millions to take revenge on <br/>having been so comprehensively and deceitfully conned in 1975 into <br/>joining the EEC; not realising as did our political masters at the time <br/>that the hidden agenda was always about becoming a United States of <br/>Europe. We're not going to fooled again!</p>

<p>This time the decision is in fact much easier to make as the con (Cameron's pitiful and meaningless negotiation attempt) is plain for all but the stupidest to <br/>see - except for Mark Barber below. The EU is demonstrably unfit for purpose; indeed its shambolic actions of late have been downright dangerous and indicative of everything that is foul about an undemocratic, bullying and shamefully <br/>corrupt regime that closely mirrors the blind power crazy hegemony of <br/>the former USSR.</p>

<p>The deal is simple: once again to be a self governing sovereign nation. And, if in the short term there are economic penalties these will be a price well worth paying to be free from being part of the rotten filth that the EU has become!</p>

<p>Interesting that you are part of the 'older generation' and are advocating Brexit. I think this referendum may be generational in its voting intent. I have yet to see a person below fifty attached to any of the out campaigns.</p>

<p>You should get out more.  Are you a pollster?  [snigger]</p>

<p>No. But it also a fact that UKIP has three times the number of supporters over 60 than 40. i really think age will come into play on this vote.</p>

<p>Nobody can predict the result of this referendum, if indeed we even get one.  Dog don't call him Dave the Liar for nothing you know!  Perhaps our Dear Leaderette will decide that the few steaming lumps of horse droppings he has dragged back from Brussels on the back of a shovel obviates the need to pose the question to us swivel-eyed, racist fruitcakes and nutters at all?  Or mayhap, he may lard himself up in even more graphite, WD40 and PTFE grease and delay the referendum till 2017, 18, or doomsday, in the light of the tens of millions of illiterate savages washing up on our borders like piles of logs and vexing the 3 Customs Officers tasked with their repulsion [ and all without any overtime and all ] ?  The fact is, in times of uncertainty, or nincompoop, vacillating Government and real public fear of their loved ones getting pauperised or hurt, the proposals of those in power almost always get rejected.  And that will not do for Mr Dave Cameronb*llocks - he wants to win and he wants to stay in.</p>

<p>Perhaps, unlike my generation, they are now too far removed from the pesrsonal knowledge of how difficult it is to win and maintain freedom and how easy it is to lose!!</p>

<p>I disagree. Many have witnessed the UK bringing 'freedom' to others based on fabricated evidence.</p>

<p>I have yet to meet a young person who has any interest. They barely know what the political parties in their own country stand for, let alone what is going on in yurup. Except that there are too many immigrants of a certain kind.</p>

<p>I would say your experience isn't typical. Many young people I have spoken to embrace the EU and want to take advantage of the opportunity to study tuition free, learn other languages and live and work in countries with a different mentality towards them.</p>

<p>You can learn another language but tutition is never free.</p>

<p>In any case, the EU does not permit that. It just gets in the way.</p>

<p>The truth is that the EU is utterly unnecessary.</p>

<p>No you're wrong. The ERASMUS programme allows students of any member state to study where they wish. Nearly all similar economies in the EU offer tuition free higher education. The English were persuaded to vote against that concept due to its 'unaffordability'</p>

<p>On leaving the EU it will still be open to UK universities to come to arrangements with foreign universities for student exchanges. Foreigners are generally keen to spend time in English-speaking countries.  Such links existed in pre-Erasmus days.<br/>Life at a foreign university is not always an academic utopia. I recently spoke with an English girl who spent a year at a French university. She was disappointed at the poor behaviour at lectures and the lack of respect for staff. The level of work and rate of progress were also poor.  She wondered whether the year had been well spent.</p>

<p>Well, if they get their wish, very good luck to them. I won't be here for all that long to watch it, but at least they can't blame me.</p>

<p>Human beings aren't as pliable and predictable as you elitists think.</p>

<p>The German elite have destroyed their own country and now want a fuel tax on all EU countries to pay for millions of migrants, the chaos unleashed instigated by US foreign policy in intervening in the Middle East and the europhile fanatics acting as puppets for US foreign policy. Its a matter of paying billions to be ruled  by a German dominated Europhile fanatic extremists and their corporate henchmen  or to decide our own destiny in a sovereign free democratic state.</p>

<p>We're repeatedly told that barbarian immigration is economically beneficial, so shouldn't we be expecting a "Migrant dividend"?</p>

<p>We are also told that robots and automation will replace the need for most workers, so there is no need for more mass immigration.</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>How is the importation of unemployable young Muslim men economically beneficial?  Ah yes Dave can ask the other EU members to apply the benefit brake.......</p>

<p>Most people are talking about the way they are going to vote and the possible result of the upcoming referendum as if the way they vote will have something to do with it.<br/>Virtually every person of influence in our country (politicians, civil servants and business leaders, and probably very soon the religionistas) are determined to get a remain result. On the other hand it seems masses of the electorate are determined to get out.<br/>There has been absolutely no discussion and no interest on what will happen if the result is leave. These people of influence, after all, only have one vote each in a fair referendum. This, to me, is very scary and leads me to believe the outcome has already been decided. </p>

<p>This is why cameron has told MPs to ignore grassroots opinion.</p>

<p>The EU has no external borders; nobody wants to pay for them. Last year a million people entered and were allowed to go wherever they wanted. Many went to Germany and crime rates in Germany went up. The police even tried to cover up the worst of these crimes. People who protested were denounced as racists.</p>

<p>In 5 years time the very same criminals will be eligible to come here.</p>

<p>The EU is a nightmare, a basket case ! Voting to Remain would be like voting for a perpetual NU Labour government that you could never again vote out.</p>

<p>Vote LEAVE</p>

<p>I think it maybe worse than that. At the moment the EU are bullying whole countries into submission with bureaucrats and bankers. How much worse will it get once they have their own military (and paramilitary police). Will they hesitate to use them against their own population? Probably not! They don't seem to be of a mind set that is much different to the old USSR.</p>

<p>Half the EU countries these days were part of the old USSR. I can't for the life of me think why they want to be part of another one.</p>

<p>Germany alone took in more than 127,000 in December and more than 91,000 in January.  For all of the EU, counting all the numerous other entry points in this EU borderless farce, as well as those getting into other EU countries, in those two months (of winter, remember) there were perhaps 300,000 in total.</p>

<p>Over the whole of 2016, there will be two or three million.  Add in family members, it will effectively be TEN million, at the very least.</p>

<p>Muslim?  80% or 90% of them.</p>

<p>Voting to "remain" would be a vote for national suicide.</p>

<p>In Iowa if Cruz secured 7 delegates and Trump won 6, how is that "not even very close"?</p>

<p>Toss of a coin decided it..</p>

<p>ALL DT articles must contain a pop at Trump...even the cricket and Celebrity Big Brother reports</p>

<p>It is all clearly described in The Camp of the Saints (1973) by Jean Raspail.  Well worth reading and it makes DC look a bit redundant.</p>

<p>1973 - the year Dr Henry Kissinger took over the world while his President had his back to the wall over Watergate.</p>

<p>I chiefly remember Kissinger being lauded and rewarded for giving away things that were not in his gift and creating real problems behind the scene.</p>

<p>Why is "Fugue For A Darkening Island" by Christopher Priest, an Englishman, and published in 1972, ignored?</p>

<p>Just downloaded it from Amazon.</p>

<p>don't bother</p>

<p>Because nobody's ever heard of it.</p>

<p>The establishment doesn't like to lose! We will leave over the establishment's dead body, I hope!</p>

<p>Too right. <br/>The UK electorate will be defrauded if they vote leave. Just like Ireland was.<br/><a href="http://www.brugesgroup.com/MaryEllenSynonSpeech2013.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.brugesgroup.com/Mar...</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/12144213/Key-member-of-Jeremy-Corbyns-campaign-team-has-conviction-for-election-fraud.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...</a><br/>.<br/>A 'remain' result will be handsomely helped by such as the above link which is not an isolated incident in the voting procedure by any means.</p>

<p>That criminal only got 100 hours community service for the fraud. That was very cheap for her, so I reckon she will do it again.</p>

<p>Didn't Stalin say "It's not about who votes. It's about who counts the votes".<br/>Goldman Sachs is funding the Remain campaign and I wouldn't put any trust in that "Giant Vampire squid with its tentacles wrapped around the face of humanity" any more than I would trust Microsoft, if it volunteered, for free, to count the votes.</p>

<p>And we all know who used to work for Goldman Sachs, don't we Mr Carney.</p>

<p>It's not just Carney. GS's tentacles go far and wide within the EU.<br/>Greece's entry into the euro was ensured by GS "cooking its books".</p>

<p>But they're only thinking of the children, the little children.</p>

<p>That Bill Gates's whiny little voice makes me want to puke. He's an a**hole. A complete SJW a**hole.</p>

<p>The reason the polsters can't get elections right is that they are asking a stupid question.</p>

<p>We all know now there is no difference between one party and another.  They all tell lies to get elected and then do whatever the bankers tell them to do.  It doesn't matter if they are right or left, DemonCraps or God'sOwnPlonkers, LoveyDim, Corblymy, Camermoron, they all do just what the others would do.  And what the people want them to do doesn't even cross their minds.</p>

<p>We have systems of election that ensure that the status quo always prevails.</p>

<p>So we know it doesn't matter.  However a referendum is different - in a referendum we are voting for POLICY, not Plonker!</p>

<p>I'm voting 'Death to the French (and EU)', it doesn't matter what is actually on the ballot paper, I'll find the one that means that.  I don't care if the guy that stands for my policy is called Garage or Ho Chi Min.</p>

<p>This is finally the vote the electorate didn't get when they weren't asked for their permission over the mass immigration into the country.At last a chance to say no by voting for a Brexit and show the politicians who's really in charge.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Stupid be as stupid is...</p>

<p>Having a bad hair day are we..</p>

<p>Barber...bad hair day...very clever</p>

<p>No, why?</p>

<p>How is it stupid to want your country to be free and independent and to govern itself?----------That's what we fought two world wars for.</p>

<p>Because we will never be free to govern ourselves - it is a tough old world out there. You need friends, not independence.</p>

<p>If you look at the figures the EU needs us more than we need them, we are in a position where we can impose our will on them from the outside. Instead of being ruled by Berlin from the inside.</p>

<p>Take no notice of the Barber chap. Poor fellow, still labouring under the illusion that Cameron's a conservative at heart. He might "identify" as a Tory, but Dave is just a soft left pinko Blairite, we all know that.</p>

<p>Perhaps the pollsters are right and the votes are rigged?</p>

<p>When people see all these muslim "refugees",  issued with passports by Germany, Poland, Rumania and wherever else they've ended up. Then they all head over here for the benefits that will significantly boost the leave campaign.</p>

<p>Eastern Europe doesn't issue passports to Muslims. Western Europe does. There aren't any Muslims in Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>Not forgetting that Dave and many in the EU also think it would be a good idea if Turkey joined.  Imagine the effect of that!</p>

<p>That's why the Dear Leader is having an early referendum.<br/>He knows that more Muslim immigration = more votes to "LEAVE"<br/>as people realise that EU = surrender to Islam.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Of course they will get far more in benefits here.</p>

<p>All polls should carry a health warning given the farce at the last election.</p>

<p>There must be a very good reason for staying in the EU.  More Tory MPs and Ministers are falling into line with our dear leader.  Would someone in the name of reason, tell me what it is?</p>

<p>They haven't got the guts or ability as leaders to leave the EU</p>

<p>Look at those voting Brexit - Farage - loser. Look at those voting remain - Cameron - winner.</p>

<p>Mark Barber = 764 comments = 505 up votes. not exactly Mister Popular are you?</p>

<p>Money.  In the pocket.  Brown envelopes....</p>

<p>Vote OUT and we'll have a new Dear Leader in June.</p>

<p>So that they can get their snouts into the trough.</p>

<p>"Wallet or country? Wallet!"</p>

<p>Career safeguarding - the Tories are going to be in power for long enough to build a few careers...</p>

<p>The vote to stay in the EU can easily be estimated from any state data on the prevalence of madness.</p>

<p>From what i saw canvassing during the GE the reverse is true - most kippers were unemployed eccentrics</p>

<p>There's a cluster around Westminster and Whitehall but you'll need an FOI request on that one.</p>

<p>People have a fear of the unknown and vote accordingly. That's why Scotland lost the independence debate.  In truth, the English, if asked, would probably have voted for Scotland to leave -  but fortunately (due oil prices) for Scotland, it was saved by a "remain" vote.  Fear of the unknown will most likely result in a " remain" vote for the EU as well.  Personally, I think we'll save so much money if we leave that I shall vote to do so. I keep thinking of the money we'd save if we weren't subsidising Scotland!</p>

<p>Doesnt your experience tell you that we are unlikely to see any of it?</p>

<p>There is as much "unknown" by staying in,  can you predict Merkels next mad idea, did she ask ANYBODY?</p>

<p>The Germans are still suffering from a collective guilty conscience...they all agreed to open borders, to start with........</p>

<p>But did she ask any other nations within the EU?  No she spoke for Europe and then demanded that Europe should take it's fair share!!!</p>

<p>well she said a million which was the estimate, but the divvy is as stupid as Cameron. All the world has internet and they act on such messages.</p>

<p>Well, like Angela said: "Germany belongs to muslims".</p>

<p>Before I make my mind up which way to vote, I need to be acquainted with all of the facts. I have already heard the "leave" argument. Now, in the interests of balance, could somebody give me a list of the countries which have benefited from mass Islamic immigration?</p>

<p>Syria and Egypt in the 600sAD. The rest of North Africa and Spain in the 700s.</p>

<p>Memories of the Alhambra?</p>

<p>Thats a "NO" ,then.</p>

<p>Tough one, give me a bit of time?<br/>Like..........................ever!</p>

<p>Pakistan Bangladesh Turkey Iran Iraq.</p>

<p>Maybe the question is easily missunderstood.</p>

<p>"Pakistan Bangladesh Turkey Iran Iraq."</p>

<p>That's reassuring!</p>

<p>That is why Dhimmy D loves it.</p>

<p>Benefited?</p>

<p>Well, all their emigrants are sending money home.....</p>

<p>Do you mean immigrants or emigrants?</p>

<p>Their emigrants become our immigrants, then send money home - hence benefit to their home country.....</p>

<p>well we have the immigration and the listed countries benefit.</p>

<p>Should I edit the question to read "host countries"?</p>

<p>I think the question and answer get the point across very well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for those who advocate staying in, they have no evidence whatsoever that the country will be in better shape in the future. They have nothing to promise.<br/>I know my environment will get decidedly worse and many others are only just coping. Mr. Cameron is taking a great risk delaying the referendum.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that Greece will stay in or that Turkey will not enter.</p>

<p>The polls are correct, it is just that they poll BBC employees and question time audience to ensure balance.</p>

<p>This weeks Question Time audience did'nt seem to be entirely impressed with Dave's "renegotiation".</p>

<p>Well they managed to find some who did, I cannot see why anyone could support Dhimmy Daves deal but they got about half to clap like seals.</p>

<p>For a Question Time audience, that was tantamount to a massive endorsement for UKIP.</p>

<p>I agree, I laughed at the muslim saying she was concerned about EU immigration, well she would be she wants immigration from South Asia not the EU.</p>

<p>Imagine her degree of 'thrust' multiplied.</p>

<p>The bus that busses them in must have broken down.</p>

<p>The EU referendum will be about as fair as the process for choosing who will hold the next world cup or Olympics.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes.... manufactured in America, under a microscope they all look like Bill Gates.... Funny that!</p>

<p>FIFA, Olympic Committee, EU, yes they all have a certain, something about them.</p>

<p>Wouldn't surprise me if Sepp Blatter is lobbying to be next president when Junker's had enough</p>

<p>Dear Janet, We already know the result. It will be Remain. No matter what the polls say and no matter how people vote, there is no way we will be allowed to leave. A second vote ( as in Ireland) is too dangerous for the "powers that be" as we've caught on to that trick, so they will just have to fix the first one. <br/>The vote will be declared for Remain, the cabinet already know this and have clearly decided not to throw their careers away on a battle they can't win. Democracy was always just a con just to placate the populace, only the ideological clowns in the Labour party would actually let it work for real and look what happened to them (and us!) - all my Tory mates paid £3, joined up and made Corbyn our next PM!</p>

<p>Numbers....  1642!</p>

<p>My sense is the polls are correct. The bulk of the population do not know that much about politics and those that vote will be inclined to the status quo, as they usually are. <br/>It's also very hard to see a majority swimming against the tide of what will surely be near-consensus among political and business leaders.</p>

<p>You may be right. The Scots were certainly kicked into line by well-orchestrated scare tactics.</p>

<p>The Scots knew that Salmond's sums didn't add up.  They didn't believe he'd be allowed to keep Sterling.</p>

<p>They weren't scared into voting to stay in the UK.   Gordon Brown - on behalf of Cameron - told them they'd get the Devo Max they really wanted.</p>

<p>The Pollsters all weight their findings:  they basically manipulate the raw data they collect to try and predict the result.  It's their weighting that is faulty.</p>

<p>I prefer to go by what I hear.</p>

<p>I've been campaigning against the EU with UKIP for about 7 years now.  Hostility to the EU has steadily grown and now, when I participate in a street stall, virtually everyone who stops to talk to me is intending to vote LEAVE.</p>

<p>Leaflets which were once ignored or refused are now taken.  People volunteer the information that they can't wait to vote to LEAVE.  Some of them are incredibly angry at Cameron's pathetic tour of Europe begging foreigners for the right to govern this country.</p>

<p>This is in True Blue Leafy Conservative Surrey .  If it's like this around here, then in the parts of the country which have been massively affected by the explosion in EU immigration, such as East Anglia, the vote for LEAVE is likely to be nearer 90% than the 45% the polls are predicting.</p>

<p>All you keyboard warriors need to volunteer to campaign for LEAVE.  We need boots on the ground to deliver leaflets;  people to man street stalls and people to canvass.  Don't leave it to someone else ...... they're probably leaving it for you.</p>

<p>Look in the mirror and you see an activist looking back.</p>

<p>VOTE LEAVE.</p>

<p>Did you know that Merkel has dropped the demographic H Bomb on Germany? The fall-out is unstoppable (Muslim breeding rates) and will utterly destroy Germany within two generations.<br/>.<br/>Deeply European Dave is itching to do the same to the UK.<br/>.<br/>And I'm not even a conspiracist. It's that obvious.</p>

<p>Dangerous Dave. I actually think he trying  to more damage to the UK than Blair managed in his ten years.</p>

<p>Correct. He's a real snake in the grass.</p>

<p>Bliar's ten years were only ever about increasing his personal bank balance.</p>

<p>It's illegal to destroy official documentation. Blair shredded his expenses. Thus he destroyed private property. Considering the state loves threatening people with imprisonment if we so much as put the wrong stuff in the wrong bin why is Blair not in prison indefinitely for fraud pending investigation, and investigation there cannot be so his imprisonment should be indefinite. He can share a cell with Mandelson.</p>

<p>And boy has he increased it...</p>

<p>I suppose it's come in handy in buying lots of things !</p>

<p>It won't do him any good. He will have to relinquish everything before long, and it will be all the more painful because he loves his wealth so much. It's his entire identity. And hers.</p>

<p>Just why are these people so intent on destroying the people's, countries and individual cultures of which they are part?</p>

<p>Why are their self-destructive tendencies being imposed on the entire continent?</p>

<p>Star Trek, I'm afraid it's no better reason than that.</p>

<p>Read about Cultural Marxism and the New World Order. Their aim is One World Government, with the elites holding all power and wealth. They will live in luxury, you will live in poverty, disease and fear in their Islamic State. And it will be in a right old state, believe me. (Think Raqqa, Baghdad, Mosul and every other crummy, busted, dirty, lawless Muslim dump you can imagine).</p>

<p>It's the dogma of Islam.</p>

<p>It's called the Death Gene of Deracinated Altruism.</p>

<p>EUgenics.</p>

<p>A fondness of the Fabians - Labour supporters.</p>

<p>Yes, Labour support the abortion of children with Down's syndrome. People like my brother.</p>

<p>When you present this to Labour voters after usually listening to an incorrect, tiresome, whining rant about 'the rich' they don't know what to say - they usual resort to trope.</p>

<p>But yeah: EU supporters, Labour voters - they support killing babies.</p>

<p>Please don't let Cameron and Merkel take you for fools:</p>

<p>You vote for Europe .. then you vote for ISLAM.<br/>You vote for Europe .. then you vote for Fascism hiding behind a mask of a religion.<br/>You vote for Europe .. then you vote for the Abuse and Rape of your womenfolk.</p>

<p>That is what Cameron and Merkel in their ignorance of Islam and its intentions are determined to get you to vote for:<br/>Albeit, your own women to live in fear of going out alone as now evident in Germany and indeed, Sweden. </p>

<p>Please don't compare us with America. The flea families (no matter how much money they have accreted) have run out of time. Best give back to the natives, they'll take better care of it.</p>

<p>When I cancelled my subscription to the DT, I was asked why and I cited Dan Hodges and Mary Riddell as the main reasons. They pis*ed me off.<br/>They get it so wrong and they get it so wrong consistently.<br/>I'll be voting LEAVE very cheerfully. My neighbours all seem to be equally cheerful about voting LEAVE. <br/>None of us have ever been polled.</p>

<p>Oh wait ... I thought the referendum was about the UK leaving Europe.  You mean it's really about the DT???</p>

<p>Where is Riddell these days?</p>

<p>Behind your ear.</p>

<p>Ousted by Hodges?<br/>Who knows. Who cares. <br/>It would be a typical Hodges move wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Well you couldn't really tell their blogs apart, I suppose.</p>

<p>Janet, people lie, you know.</p>

<p>That includes Janet, she's an Eastern-European Jew who migrated to America, thence to England. In other words, a nobody, a.k.a. a globalista. Nothing would please her more than if we were all nobodies like herself. Then she would finally feel at home. An upstart from top to bottom.</p>

<p>The European Union is going to collapse in the near future.<br/>I remember about 10 months before the Iron Curtain collapsed, Time magazine printed an edition devoted to an appraisal of the Soviet Union, which showed the USSR as a mighty, growing, expanding world power. The front cover was a photograph of the May Day parade through Red Square. The magazine lay on top of a cabinet at work all through the year and then when the Berlin Wall fell and the Red Empire went tits up, the front cover suddenly gained a sort of mystical aura, a sense of something important missed and overlooked. "What the Hell had happened ?"<br/>The EU will go as fast and again without any warning. We won't see it coming, we will be surprised and I hope overjoyed by the outcome.</p>

<p>Talking of May Day Parades, did you see the last one? That is not a lad that I'd want to be picking a fight with. If we do we can expect to see Russian, and probably Chinese troops in English High Streets.</p>

<p>Agree.<br/>2016 will be the year it happens, brought on by sight of thousands of economic migrants (bolstered by a some genuine refugees) heading for Europe.</p>

<p>You've seen World War Z? Then you get the drift.</p>

<p>The situation is very different, not least because there is only a small minority of people in the EU who would want it to collapse.<br/>The EU is also not a top-down structure as the USSR was, so is unlikely to topple.<br/>It makes sense for the core of Western Europe (at least) to be unified and I can't see that ever changing, whatever they choose to call it. The periphery is less certain, perhaps.</p>

<p>why believe them on the EU?</p>

<p>It's simple Janet, what a lot of people believe it will come down to is Vote OUT or lose your country.</p>

<p>Yes, it really is as simple as that.</p>

<p>That's an awful big essay to say that: "the polls might be wrong". But, I agree, all my circle of friends are for "leave", but none of us have been polled.</p>

<p>Do you mean awfully? Sounds like Yankspeak.</p>

<p>Sorry, you're right. Laziness and carelessness on my part.</p>

<p>Was he referring to being 'polled'  ????</p>

<p>Did you know that the electorate is over 46 million people?</p>

<p>Most polls are in the 1,000 to 2,000 person sample category, and there are many adjustments made to the raw data.</p>

<p>The probability of any one person being polled is minuscule.</p>

<p>46 million? That's just the postal votes in Tower Hamlets!</p>

<p>Brilliant </p>

<p>Understood, but you'd think I might have been asked my opinion once in 70 years? ( I even won a premium bond!)</p>

<p>If you read the material on the UK Polling Report and the British Polling Council, for a start, much will become clearer.</p>

<p><a href="http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncrm.ac.uk/polling/documents/19Jan_slides_Final1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncrm.ac.uk/polling/...</a></p>

<p>You agree we must leave though?</p>

<p>Did you know that the electorate is over 46 million people?<br/>Really, you dont say. You are a genius, dear chap.</p>

<p>The point of the figure was to demonstrate the sheer number in the total statistical "population".</p>

<p>Without quoting that, the small size of the "sample" would not explain why the probability of being polled is so small.</p>

<p>By the way, I expect you meant "don't" and not "dont".</p>

<p>Stop pointing at polls. They are irrelevant.</p>

<p>The simple truth is we must leave the EU. It's time you accepted that.</p>

<p>And yet I have made a poll of friends and acquaintances on facebook of which I have 384 Not one of them or any of their families recall doing a poll.</p>

<p>And of course it depends where they target the samples they take. It's a bit like the old Turkey adage.</p>

<p>Same as, I know no one who has ever been asked anything about politics. <br/>But although a bit partisan the DT polls seems to indicate that over 80 % are for LEAVE and so do a lot of other national daily's.</p>

<p>"the DT polls seems to indicate that over 80 % are for LEAVE and so do a lot of other national daily's."</p>

<p>Really? Evidence, please.</p>

<p>No poll from a recognised pollster has produced such a result.</p>

<p>No, most are over 90%.</p>

<p>The EU is a toxic waste dump full of bile and vile, useless, hateful greedy scum. It will end.</p>

<p>You will get your Evidence when we get our referendum.</p>

<p>Thank you for your clear response.</p>

<p>There never was any such evidence.</p>

<p>First off The DT poll indicates 83% the daily mail  has 89%  the Express has 93 % But why are you so concerned about something you clearly do not believe  Or are you the duty EU troll tonight.</p>

<p>No bona fide poll has produced such results.</p>

<p>See the UK Polling Report for all such polls.</p>

<p>False claims!</p>

<p>Links, please.</p>

<p>Your assertion was made without any support, and I challenged it.</p>

<p>Under the Philosophic Burden of Proof, the onus is on the person making an assertion to substantiate it, otherwise the assertion is invalidated.</p>

<p>"Burden of Proof (Onus Probandi)*</p>

<p>This fallacy originates from the Latin phrase "onus probandi incumbit ei qui dicit, non ei qui negat"). The burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim, not on the person who denies (or questions) the claim. The fallacy of the Burden of Proof occurs when someone who is making a claim, puts the burden of proof on another party to disprove what they are claiming."</p>

<p>How about: silence, whelp?</p>

<p>I'm tired of reading your lies. How much are you paid to fight the Eu's corner? How much of our money do you get for spreading their deceit?</p>

<p>What do you mean evidence, any one who frequents these pages would confirm this, there are frequent OPs, do your own research.</p>

<p>By the way, I do my own research and monitor the polling via the UK Polling Report and other sources on a daily basis.</p>

<p><a href="http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/</a></p>

<p>The Eu is a disgusting useless entity that we need to leave. It causes flooding, rapes, fraud, theft, poisons our foodchain, imposes damaged medical devices and actively makes us poorer and icnreases unemployment.</p>

<p>These are facts. You need to accept them, apologise for trolling and post how much you are paid - no one would support the poison of the EU as fervently as you do if they were not on the take.</p>

<p>It’s impossible to predict how voters will behave in the polling booth, for the very simple reason that they are human beings</p>

<p>It's much easier to predict the way in which the votes will be counted though.</p>

<p>Yes. We're supposed to believe that Nigel Farage lost in Thanet against a parachuted-in nonentity of a Tory candidate in what has traditionally not even a safe Tory seat - while even the council went to UKIP.</p>

<p>You can understand why they wouldn't want him in the HoC at the moment.</p>

<p>According to a defined methodology, actually.</p>

<p>What are you suggesting, Bob??</p>

<p>The guy is noted time-waster and wind-up merchant, with weird opinions. Best left alone.</p>

<p>Oh the irony!</p>

<p>You have been included in the long list with bob3.</p>

<p>Precisely.</p>

<p>How many white lines have you painted out today?</p>

<p>I wouldn't bother Bob, clearly another desperate antagonistic Troll.</p>

<p>He's suggesting our electoral system is as rotten as the American one, which is not true, except for postal voting in the West Midlands.</p>

<p>After over forty years of subterfuge and dishonesty to create this super state nobody has voted for, you don't actually beleive the people that brought it about are going to give us a fair vote on it, do you?</p>

<p>Two for In, one for Out, two for In, one for Out,two for In, one for Out, two for In, one for Out.</p>

<p>Cameron will go for the earliest possible referendum date, irrespective of the polls, since he is scared sh*tless of the almost certain prospect of British voters seeing (media permitting, of course) hundreds of thousands or even millions more Muslim invaders breaking through the EU's "borders" (yes, admittedly joke borders) month after month.  That's not to mention the ever more frequent rapes and sex assaults on European women, girls and even boys.  That's not to mention the high probability of more bloody mass terrorist attacks on the streets of Europe.  Remember he said the referendum would be "before the end of 2017"?  Why is he hurrying now?  The longer he delays, the greater will be the vote to "LEAVE" as British voters increasingly realise and recognise that they will be shackled to a corpse if they stay in this putrid, stinking EU cesspit, this oligarchy ruled by a mad German dictating to all the rest of us, this betrayal of democracy and of everything that is best about Europe, this monster destroying our societies and cultures.  So, yes, the polls are perhaps interesting for the political and media chatterati but Cameron knows his time is fast running out.  He'll go for it as soon as he can.</p>

<p>A vote for Brexit is a vote against Cameronism and I would not be surprised at a 90% OUT in June.</p>

<p>It won't make any difference of course. No legislation will ever be tabled or passed and no Royal Assent would be given if it was. We are not leaving. Ever.</p>

<p>Best to just enjoy the flying monkey show.</p>

<p>"I would not be surprised at a 90% OUT in June."</p>

<p>Everyone would be surprised if that were the case.</p>

<p>The Remain campaign can go and collect its winnings right now.</p>

<p>What people feel about Cameron has nothing to do with how they feel about the EU. Why do simpletons reduce everything to "Cameron" - he's just one man in a cabinet.</p>

<p>Oh. I didn't realise he is a man.</p>

<p>Because they are "simpletons"? It goes with the definition.</p>

<p>Lets say you've got 10 "in" and 10 "out" voters. Which group do you think would be more vociferous in making sure that they get to the polling booth to cast their vote? I think the "out" group by a considerable margin. The "outers" hate the EU with a passion. How many people can say that they know somebody that loves Europe. The only people that love the EU are the politicians. I'm fully expecting a minor earthquake.</p>

<p>Farage claimed there was going to be a Political Earthquake back in 2015.</p>

<p>It turned out to be a damp squib, like Farage.</p>

<p>Instead of posting facile responses Blackjake, why don't you give us some good reasons for staying in the EU?</p>

<p>We don't fall for that old ploy, dear chap.</p>

<p>As I have just posted elsewhere:</p>

<p>There is no "fear factor"!</p>

<p>That is just the usual stratagem played by the rattled Leavers.</p>

<p>The losers always play the Scaremongering Card, as Salmond tried in the Scottish referendum.</p>

<p>In that case, the evidence was quite clear, and the OUT campaign would have inherited a disaster.</p>

<p>The Leavers demand evidence for remaining, but when it is presented by all manner of individuals and organisations, the Leavers claim "scaremongering"!</p>

<p>It is quite amusing, really.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Remain vote will romp it.</p>

<p>Fear factor played a very large part, do you remember vote for UKIP wake up Miliband and the SNP?  Again fear factor is playing a very large part. It is the only weapon the Remain lobby have.</p>

<p>There is no "fear factor"!</p>

<p>One heck of a lot of money, Goldman Sachs, government funding, multi-national corporations and maybe, dare I say US government funding is going to be thrown at the IN campaign.  I do so hope you are right and the British people will stand up and be counted. but....</p>

<p>Today's political class don't want to lead the country, they see the role of Prime Minister as that of being a middle manager within a larger global structure. They are inadequate and rather than concede the point, they wish to trick you into believing that their approach is correct, that the alternative is too scary to contemplate.</p>

<p>They're wrong. A brighter more prosperous and secure future awaits the UK if the electorate can demonstrate the balls our leaders lack and vote to leave the EU.</p>

<p>Yes. But in addition we need a new class of leaders that have not spent their whole career in a political bubble. Merely leaving the EU is not, on its own, enough.</p>

<p>Agreed, leaving is just the start. We need to replace vast swathes of our political class.</p>

<p>Any person with an IQ in the plus category, must by now have realised that that paying to belong to a corrupt organisation, that cannot get the accounts passed over several years is to court disaster. Britain had a reputation for democracy, freedom of speech, long established human rights, and a mature and well established legal system, now defunct due to Europe's interference.</p>

<p>I am not sure the reputation you describe is valid anymore. Britain was the definer of natural rights and freedoms. Democracy is futile when you have no real choice. Freedom of speech is a charade when "hate speech" puts people in the dock, government departments control the content of adverts and political speech, and human rights are controlled by the EU. The legal system babies terrorists and jails British soldiers. Britain's reputation is as old fashioned as Mrs. Daley's description of people's voting habits.</p>

<p>Yet the reason we have no choice is because we have no democracy. Quite obviously without referism, recall and genuine demos kratos we have no control over the political class.</p>

<p>I rather think that toboot's point is exactly that.</p>

<p>I thought toboot's point was more about saving Britain's reputation, but I could easily be wrong.</p>

<p>"paying to belong to a corrupt organisation, that cannot get the accounts passed over several years is to court disaster."</p>

<p>That is false!</p>

<p>The European Court of Auditors has signed off the accounts every year since 2007. They have made official statements to that effect.</p>

<p>It is preferable that posters stick to writing the truth.</p>

<p>No, they haven't.</p>

<p>The ECA say otherwise:</p>

<p>"Annual report of the European Court of Auditors – Frequently Asked Questions</p>

<p>Brussels, 05 November 2014</p>

<p>The European Commission welcomed today the European Court of Auditors' latest report on the management of the EU budget. It states that in 2013 the error rate was 4.7%, compared to 4.8% in 2012, and it continues to be below 5% for many years now. This shows that the Commission's continuous efforts to improve the management of EU funds pay off.</p>

<p>With regard to the EU's account keeping, this is the seventh year in a row that the Commission has been given a clean bill of health by the Court of Auditors. In other words, the day-to-day accounting practices of the Commission have proven themselves solid and reliable throughout the entire 2007-2013 period."</p>

<p>Nonsense. The auditors have given a qualified opinion on the EU accounts every year meaning that there were material irregularities every year.</p>

<p>You should keep yourself better informed, dear chap.</p>

<p>Read the annual accounts, then show me where the ECA says "The accounts are qualified" (your words).</p>

<p>Re: Claim by Telegraph that EU auditors refuse to sign off more than £100 billion of its own spending</p>

<p>Dear Jon,</p>

<p>It is a frequent misunderstanding that the ECA did not approve or sign off the EU accounts. As stated in our Annual Report on the implementation of the EU budget for 2013 (published last week), the ECA has signed off the 2013 accounts of the European Union (as it has for every financial year since 2007). The misunderstanding might be related with the ECA’s opinion on the underlying payments, which has been negative (adverse) for 2013 and the preceding 19 years.</p>

<p>In relation to the cited article by the Daily Telegraph, I hope the following explanations will be useful in reporting correctly about the findings of our Annual Report. You may also consult our FAQ sheet, which we have published to encourage correct understanding and reporting of our Annual Report.</p>

<p>The cited Daily Telegraph article among others says that the Brussels accounts have not been given the all clear for 19 years running, that £5.5 billion of the EU budget last year was misspent because of controls on spending that were deemed to be only partially effective by experts, and that the audit found that £109 billion out of a total of £117 billion spent by the EU in 2013 was affected by material error.</p>

<p>What we say in our Annual Report is:</p>

<p>The ECA has signed off the 2013 accounts as reliable (given a ‘clean opinion’), as it has for every financial year since 2007.</p>

<p>The ECA concludes that the 2013 accounts present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the EU and its results for the year. As well as the opinion on the accounts, the ECA is also required to give an opinion – based on its audit testing – on whether the underlying payments were made in accordance with EU rules. For 2013, the estimated level of error in these transactions was again too high at 4.7% for the ECA to give a clean opinion on the regularity of expenditure.</p>

<p>The control systems are – in general – only partly effective. That is why there are errors in payments. The estimated error rate was 4.7%.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the blame for errors rests with those [- beneficiaries and/or Member State authorities - ] who make incorrect claims for funding. However, control systems at both Member State and EU level should prevent such claims being processed in the first place, or detect and correct them after the event. There is potential to use control systems more effectively to reduce the error rate. The ECA concluded that for a large proportion of the errors found, national authorities had sufficient information available to have detected and corrected many of them before claiming reimbursement from the Commission. This could have significantly reduced the error rate.</p>

<p>The total amount of EU budget in 2013 was €148.5 billion and the error rate was 4.7%.</p>

<p>In the past, some commentators have multiplied the total EU budget by the error rate and came up with a total for “money wasted”. This approach is simplistic and can be misleading.</p>

<p>The £109 billion refers to the spending areas for which our audit work shows a material error rate. This is correct but vastly overstates the impact of those errors: 4.7% of the budget as a whole.</p>

<p>• The Auditors reported that the European Commission’s accounts were legal, regular and reliable (i.e. accurate).</p>

<p>Feel free to write to them and tell *them* they are wrong.</p>

<p>You do realise the ECA only audit the EU's books and nobody else's? Hardly the most independent of organisations.</p>

<p>Not independent? Really?</p>

<p>"Overview</p>

<p>Role: To check EU funds are collected and used correctly, and help improve EU financial management.</p>

<p>President: Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira</p>

<p>Members: 1 from each EU country</p>

<p>Established in: 1977</p>

<p>Location: Luxembourg</p>

<p>Website: European Court of Auditors</p>

<p>As the EU's independent external auditor, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) looks after the interests of EU taxpayers. It does not have legal powers, but works to improve the European Commission's management of the EU budget and reports on EU finances.</p>

<p>What does the ECA do?</p>

<p>Audits EU revenue &amp; expenditure, to check EU funds are correctly raised, spent, achieve value for money and accounted for.</p>

<p>Checks any person or organisation handling EU funds – including spot checks in EU institutions (especially the Commission), EU countries and countries receiving EU aid.</p>

<p>Writes up findings and recommendations in audit reports, for the European Commission and national governments.</p>

<p>Reports suspected fraud, corruption or other illegal activity to the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)</p>

<p>Produces an annual report for the European Parliament and Council of the EU, which the Parliament examines before deciding whether to approve the Commission's handling of the EU budget.</p>

<p>Gives its expert  opinion to EU policymakers on how EU finances could be better managed and made more accountable to citizens.</p>

<p>Also publishes opinions on preparatory legislation that will impact EU financial management, as well as position papers, reviews and ad hoc publications on EU public finance issues.</p>

<p>To be effective, the Court must be independent of the institutions and bodies it audits. To this end, it is free to decide on:</p>

<p>what it will audit</p>

<p>how to do this</p>

<p>how &amp; when to present its findings</p>

<p>The Court's audit work focuses mainly on the European Commission – the main body responsible for implementing the EU budget. But it also works closely with national authorities, because the Commission manages most EU funds (around 80%) jointly with them.</p>

<p>Composition</p>

<p>Court members are appointed by the Council, after consulting the Parliament, for renewable 6-year terms. They choose one of their number as President for a 3-year term (also renewable).</p>

<p>How does the ECA work?</p>

<p>It carries out 3 types of audit:</p>

<p>Financial audits – checking that accounts accurately present the financial position, results and cash flow for the year.</p>

<p>Compliance audits – checking that financial transactions follow the rules.</p>

<p>Performance audits – checking that the EU funds achieve its goals with the fewest possible resources and in the most economical manner.</p>

<p>The Court is divided into audit groups called 'chambers'. They prepare reports &amp; opinions for the Court members to adopt, thus making them official."</p>

<p>Oh dear life! Next you'll be saying the EU is democratic! For goodness sake! The accounts for the EU are riddled with fraud, theft and corruption. They are never independently  audited because were they to be the EU would be dissolved and those controlling it imprisoned.</p>

<p>Nothing about the EU is independent. It's a sham, and you know it. You're just terrified of admitting the truth.</p>

<p>Snore,             cut and paste, are you related to  ignoramus jack ?</p>

<p>The facts too complicated for you, dear chap?</p>

<p>If you make a cup of tea, put away that glass, and read, slowly, you will see the official evidence.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I'll put you on the list of time-wasters and wind-up merchants.</p>

<p>Ironic that you're the one refusing to accept the truth.</p>

<p>Signed off, yes I believe, but with notable discrepancies I also believe.</p>

<p>No one believes this, the only way they managed to nail Al Capone was bad book keeping. And the EU is run on the same lines as the Mafia.</p>

<p>Yes, signed off.</p>

<p>Pointing to the EU to say the EU accounts are valid is laughable. Next you'll be saying Mandelson isn't corrupt, or that Kinnock is honest, or the commission democratic.</p>

<p>For goodness sake. Does the dissonance of reality and your lies cause you pain?</p>

<p>Do you want to live in our country where we make the laws and vote for who leads us.<br/>or<br/>Do you want to live in a country where the Germans(EU) rule us and make all the laws by people who we cannot vote for.</p>

<p>Its as simple as that.</p>

<p>It is only that "simple" in your own mind, dear chap.</p>

<p>Yet... Johnny is right and you are not. You know you're not so you don't dispute the argument, just attack the man: because you are wrong.</p>

<p>Just because it is simple does not make it incorrect.</p>

<p>Correct, but in your case it does.</p>

<p>Simple perhaps, but fundamental.</p>

<p>Are you a white line remover?</p>

<p>No, he's a Eurotroll. Expect lots of them in coming months.</p>

<p>Well, Janet, you should start to believe the overwhelming commitment that exists among ' blue collar' workers , white collar strivers and the over 50s age groups. They cannot wait for their chance to vote for less immigration , tight border controls and for laws to be made only in their own country; here. Nothing much else counts for them in the coming Referendum.<br/>Only the " leave" option " offers the prospect  of winning them their highest  priorities.  <br/>These peopls' minds are made up . They are not going to be influenced by any  political party flummery  and shenanigans. <br/>These people have not much need for opinion polls, either. <br/>Their could easily be a new Conservative Prime Minister come July.<br/></p>

<p>You really believe that tosh? You should be following the telephone polling results.</p>

<p>I'm over 50, and refuse to talk to pollsters - they ignore the fact that I'm registered with the TPS. My kind of attitude helped confound the pollsters at the general election. In addition vast numbers of mobiles are not listed and will therefore not be called. Why do you think the results will be better this time?</p>

<p>The polling methodology will be improved because of the research done by Curtice and Sturgis, and the greater-than-ever focus on the polling industry.</p>

<p>Its the ordinary people vs the politicians , corporate business and the BBC. Its as simple as that.</p>

<p>Cruz cheated. Thats how he won, nothing to do with the polls</p>

<p>Cheated what? Death?</p>

<p>You should decline to subscribe further to Conspiracy Theorists Monthly.</p>

<p>The Big difference Janet is this is not about Party politics No matter which way anyone votes Yes or NO the outcome will not affect their party. There is no danger to their MP or leader. This is a cross party issue.</p>

<p>I did not bother listening to or reading what the polls said at the General Election, preferring to make up my own mind on the party I would vote for.  I have already decided which way to vote in the EU referendum, so have no need to depend on polls which can be too easily manipulated and therefore cannot be trusted (much like our Prime Minister). </p>

<p>The polls lie.</p>

<p>The most important thing is who is in charge of ballot boxes, who counts the ballot votes, who counts the postal votes and who does the adding up..............</p>

<p>Whatever the result of the referendum the losing side will inevitably cry "foul". By then it will be too late to find out whether allegations of 'vote rigging' have any merit.</p>

<p>I am sure that there are many folks who would voluntarily give up their time on election day to ensure fair play.</p>

<p>Could this be organised ?</p>

<p>You are surely not suggesting....</p>

<p>Only according to Farage, who has been known to make statement after statement which he then backs away from.</p>

<p>You seem to be very keen that other people back up their statements with evidence. Perhaps you'd please do the same?</p>

<p>How about:</p>

<p>Farage claims:</p>

<p>1/ Thanet South - claims of irregularities, no complaint made.</p>

<p>2/ Oldham - claims of irregularities ("unimpeachable source"), no complaint made.</p>

<p>3/ Wheels coming loose on car - claims of tampering and allegations of statement made by mechanics, no complaint made - Later said, "I made a mistake".</p>

<p>Farage has always been full of the hottest of air, with his statements about a "People's Party" and a "political earthquake".</p>

<p>Result? One marginal seat after spending untold millions of rich donors' money.</p>

<p>OK, you hate Farage. Most crazed statists do. However you keep to the easy things and don't consider his real problems because that would also destroy you, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Only according to 50% of the nation.</p>

<p>Farage claims:</p>

<p>1/ Thanet South - claims of irregularities, no complaint made.</p>

<p>2/ Oldham - claims of irregularities ("unimpeachable source"), no complaint made.</p>

<p>How much are you paid to post gibberish like this?</p>

<p>Ideally there would be no postal votes. For something this important you should be expected to turn up in person if you want to help decide on the survival of the UK.</p>

<p>This referendum represents our last chance to save our country.<br/>If we remain in the EU the Muslims now overwhelming Europe will be entitled to come here.<br/>They will come.<br/>They will overwhelm us and our culture will die.</p>

<p>"This referendum represents our last chance to save our country."</p>

<p>Oh, dear! What has the UK come to when people write such tosh.</p>

<p>Far too long chained to a facist communist entity devoted to destroying it.</p>

<p>The problem is, BJ, <u>you</u> are part of the problem.</p>

<p>Only in *your* mind, dear chap.</p>

<p>I am the disinfectant, the aerosol, to keep the pest population under control.</p>

<p>When you have a pest problem in your house or building, you engage the pest controllers.</p>

<p>Think of me as something like The Ghostbusters, my good man.</p>

<p>Disinfectant? You're the mold. All you spread is FUD - as a paid up Europhiliac.</p>

<p>You're the problem.</p>
