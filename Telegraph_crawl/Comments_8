<p>Traditionally the British people are hard to move. We like things moderate and pleasant wherever possible. We don't generally go for coups or shooting politicians nor do we like extremism - with the exception of our Islamic countrymen that is.</p>

<p>But, once is a while when we are pushed and pushed and pushed the people will stand up and even when the odds are stacked we will give the collective 'Vee,' and deal with the fallout. What we are getting now is the start of a bombardment of truths, half truths and outright lies from the politicians and the BBC who will be desperate to keep us in the EU. MP's will be desperate to ensure that the post Westminster gravy train keeps on rolling. The BBC is full of socialists hell bent on a new world order run by our betters who know what we should and should not do.</p>

<p>And little by little many of the proper British people - the woman and man in the street - get more and more fed up with the posturing and utter madness that seems to pour from every corner of the media and the political establishment regarding the EU. We can't get rid of criminals because the ECHR says so. The EU demands more money from the British taxpayer because it's wasted the last uncountable billions already given. Borders are left open for Islamic people who share nothing in common with our cultures yet demand that we take care of them even when a large percentage hate us. Women are being abused but the authorities are too scared to face up to it because it might offend a medieval bunch of murder cult believers.</p>

<p>We have a chance to give the EU the 'Up yours.' Yes, maybe it will be a bit tricky for a bit but in the long run regaining control of our borders, institutions and money will only be a good thing. Trade is universal and 68 million punters is too big a market for the EU to ignore out of spite. I'll happily continue to buy German cars - I just don't want to be controlled by them.</p>

<p>Wait and see. With one big question on the agenda the BBC will have to do something it has not done before. It will make sure the pro-EU side is subjected to serious questioning. Then remember how Ed Milliband was crushed the Question Time audience in Yorkshire. A few incidents like this would give the leavers the momentum they need. And if this happens the slippery pole Tories will start wondering if their careers might not turn out better if they voted with the diehard leavers who select and reselect Tory candidates.</p>

<p>Him and his stupid hands. Honestly he looks like the village idiot</p>

<p>Quite how you can write that, when with a moniker like that you clearly are exactly what you think Cameron looks like.</p>

<p>Just take a look at the weakness of those ministers in the Out section.</p>

<p>They are not even second-raters!</p>

<p>Those sitting on the fence - especially May, Gove and Johnson - will never switch to Leave. They regard their own political careers too well.</p>

<p>Think of it as an opportunity to get out of a suicide pact.</p>

<p>"If the late February meeting of the European Council endorses the renegotiation package, it will be put on the shelf until after a referendum decides whether the UK will be remaining in or leaving the European Union. Only after this principle is settled will the European Commission and Parliament take steps to put the terms of the truce into effect."<br/>Did I understand this properly?<br/>Nothing of this meant to be "renegotiation" should happen -if is- before the British voters decide to stay in the EU.  Who is kidding whom?</p>

<p><i>"Did I understand this properly?"</i></p>

<p>Oh yes, you certainly did.</p>

<p>Yet more (Cast Iron) promises we are supposed to believe in.</p>

<p><a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/f8/48/4e/f8484e90cb7ba5517d0bbe01af0456d7.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pini...</a></p>

<p>We are supposed to trust the EU's promise to "think about it".<br/>Sorry, this ought to be a cash with order deal - if we then vote to leave they have lost nothing but if we have to rely on them to come through after we have laid down our arms we are likely to be dismissed with nothing.<br/>You know, much as I do not trust Cameron whose promises seem worthless, the EU's promises are probably even less trustworthy. <br/>Too many opportunities for new leaders, changing officials etc to claim not to be bound by what their predecessors said or did.</p>

<p>Exactly!</p>

<p>'To appease this anti-EU faction, the Prime Minister committed himself to fight for a package of changes that would return substantial powers to the UK Parliament.'</p>

<p>A good plan but what a pity that European Parliament President Martin Schulz said today in an interview with Sky News :-</p>

<p>'Some of the EU reforms set out by David Cameron, the Prime Minister, this week - notably the "brake" on paying benefits to migrants from the EU for four years - have to be approved by the European Parliament.</p>

<p>Mr Schulz said that he expected this process to take weeks or months.He said that while the principle of the deal would be the same as agreed by British voters at the referendum the details of the deal could be amended by MEPs as it progressed through Parliament.'</p>

<p>In other words tell the voters what they want to hear and once they have voted to remain within the EU the European Parliament will renege on the deal. No change there then and a bit like political manifesto at election time.</p>

<p>No wonder people are totally disenchanted with politicians, politics and the EU. However it is a pleasant surprise for one of the unholy Brussels Brethren to warn us that they are going to screw us over.</p>

<p>Turkey Planning Military Invasion in Syria</p>

<p>Lets hope those same people protesting outside the UK Parliament will be protesting outside Turkey Embassy  waving their placards and banners "Hands of Syria".</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that waving placards in front of any embassy does not change anything, I think if Turkey is going to invade Syria that is with the agreement of Nato (USA, UK, etc...) like the assault on Bashar al Assad since 2011 by terrorists financed by Qatar and Saudi Arabia has been. They still at it!</p>

<p>Is this flimsy 'analysis' really the best the ESRC can get for their grant money? <br/>This bit made me laugh, as it let the cat out of the bag:<br/>"The Prime Minister’s...own default position, to remain in the EU...is not a positive commitment to Britain having a future in Europe but an easier policy for him to implement than steering Britain’s EU exit"<br/>That statement does have a certain disarming (and I think unintended) honesty - but the writer's idea that Brexit voters are inspired by 'wartime movies' is nonsense. As is the idea that somebody working for a firm that trades with another EU country would therefore vote to Remain. Both assertions are facile, and based on lazy 1970s stereotypes.</p>

<p>And by the way - does the EU give any funding to the ESRC for its 'UK in a Changing Europe' programme? That seems a fair question to ask, as UK academia is already drowning in EU bribes.</p>

<p>Sick of seeing posts with assertions like this: "as part of the world's largest single market, UK firms can export freely to more than 500 million people in the EU. "</p>

<p>Are these people so stupid they don't realise EVERY country in the world can export freely to the EU? Have they not noticed that the overwhelming majority of goods in stores throughout the EU are made in China and NOT in the EU. Have they not heard of Microsoft, or Apple, or Toyota or Samsung or LG or Cisco or Amazon or .....</p>

<p>If there is one area where the EU has little impact in practice it is actually in the area of trade.</p>

<p>"Are these people so stupid they don't realise every country can export freely to the EU? "</p>

<p>Can they?</p>

<p>What's the point of professors if they have nothing more interesting than this to say?</p>

<p>'Publish or perish.' So he escapes the lions for another week.<br/>My sympathies are with the lions.</p>

<p>'The voters who will tip the balance in the referendum expected in June are those who feel they have a civic duty to vote but not to understand how European institutions work.'</p>

<p>Don't you love the patronising tone of the academic mercenary?</p>

<p>And there is nothing to suggest our politicians are any wiser than we are which is what he seems to imply along with the "trust us, we know what we are doing" which is how dictatorships may work but not democracies. <br/>But then this is the ego of Cameron that he knows best what is goiod for us and with that attitude he will be quite comfortable ignoring a vote to leave because he thinks he knows better and thinks it will be in our best interests to stay no matter what the electorate think.</p>

<p>Oh how I long for us to get some decent referendum legislation along the lines of the Swiss, then there would be no alternative for traitors like Cameron but to take us out if we say we want out. As it is there is nothing to prevent him ignoring the referendum just as Tsipras ignored the Greek referendum and the EU ignores any and all referendums it doesn't like and speaking of whom we should be ready for all the tricks in the EU arsenal to be deployed as the referendum approaches including spending shed-loads of money on the "In" campaign.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your thoughtful post.</p>

<p><i>"And there is nothing to suggest our politicians are any wiser than we are"</i></p>

<p>And a great deal to suggest they put their chances of a place on the Brussels gravy train way above their commitment to the greater good of the electorate who they purport to represent.</p>

<p>Sometimes BSOD I despair that you can even think to write such a thing.</p>

<p>Are you so completely blind to the fact that Farage and his assorted <s>criminals</s>cronies have had their seats in the First Class carriage of the Brussels Gravy train for 17 years now?</p>

<p>What is it that makes you so blind and indifferent to his proven and constant troughing?</p>

<p>What is it that makes you think that others might aspire to be such pond life as Farage?</p>

<p>As a shy high kipper yourself, you will of course appreciate how vitally important Nigel Farage and UKIP are to Britain.</p>

<p>Especially now that it has been proved the Conservative Party cannot be trusted on 'Europe'.</p>

<p>As the eminent Charles Moore himself tells us..</p>

<p>'What the Prime Minister offered to the House of Commons on Wednesday is so worthless that it is almost embarrassing to expend any ink on it'.</p>

<p>So the kippers were right all along, and now UKIP is obviously well placed to hoover up all the broken Conservative pieces.</p>

<p>Goodbye Kate Hoey. One after the other they all see no sense in campaigning for leaving the EU.</p>

<p>More lies from the Remain camp.</p>

<p>She's still in.</p>

<p>I wouldn't bother. In all likelihood tomato has been shipped from Brussels, probably in a crate recycled from CAP and energy subsidies.</p>

<p>hey tomato, where are you from?</p>

<p>Why the UK Voters will keep us in the EU:</p>

<p>'1. Jobs:</p>

<p>as part of the world's largest single market, UK firms can export freely to more than 500 million people in the EU. The EU provides a 4-5% per annum benefit to UK GDP. 10% of UK jobs (3.1 million) directly depend on our membership in the EU (CBI, 2013 and UK Treasury, June 2014). 60% of non-UK financial firms are based in London because the UK is an EU member. 1,600 Japanese companies have invested in UK because we have unfettered access to the EU single market. For example, UK car manufacturers export 80% of their production of which 61% goes to the EU market. Outside the EU, our access to the single EU market would be impaired by tariff and non-tariff barriers, and foreign investment (and jobs) in the UK would gradually decline because corporate profit margins would be eroded, if not eliminated.</p>

<p>2. Trade:</p>

<p>as part of the EU, the UK benefits from better trade deals which generates more jobs and direct investment. Each UK household is better off by £3.000 per annum (CBI, 2013). If the UK left the EU, we would not benefit from existing and potential EU free trade arrangements with the US, Japan and rising economies. Alone the UK, as the world's ninth largest economy with only 2% of global GDP, would have less weight in international negotiations with major economies, including the EU (to which we export 45% of our exports but receive only 7% of EU 27 total exports).</p>

<p>3. Influence in Europe:</p>

<p>as part of the EU, the UK is able to influence decision making in Brussels. The UK influences and agrees all EU legislation through the participation of our elected ministers in the EU Council and elected members in the European Parliament. If the UK is not at the table, we cannot influence EU decisions. Outside the EU we would have to adopt most EU Single Market regulations anyway as non-members like Norway and Switzerland know. Switzerland in particular has to negotiate time-consuming, bureaucratic and sub-optimal ad hoc deals. Furthermore, if Norway and Switzerland want access to the large Single European Market, they still have to pay into the EU budget. Any cost budgetary cost savings from leaving the EU would be immaterial, but the macro-economic cost would not!</p>

<p>4. Free movement:</p>

<p>Free movement of labour, capital, goods and services throughout the EU benefits the UK. Free movement of people is part of the package of four EU freedoms along with free movement of capital, goods and services. Even a non-member like Norway has to accept free movement if it wants access to the EU Single Market. If we wanted to restrict free movement of people, would we want to see restrictions on our export of goods and services to elsewhere in the EU? EU workers living in the UK help fill skills gaps, eg the NHS would collapse without them. EU nationals in the UK come here to work - only 2.7% of those claiming UK job seekers allowance were other 27 EU member state nationals (DSS). Two and a half million UK nationals live elsewhere in the EU and our expatriates benefit from the ability to work in, study, and access health and other services offered by other EU states</p>

<p>5. Peace &amp; Human Rights:</p>

<p>the UK benefits from the EU's contribution to building peace, reconciliation, democracy and human rights across Europe (for which the EU was awarded the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize). The EU has contributed to peace in Europe for 56 years. It supported Spain and Greece in their transitions from dictatorship to democracy. The EU, with the UK in the lead, helped transform Communist Central European countries into democracies resulting in the reunification of Europe. Armed conflict between any EU state is now unthinkable.</p>

<p>6. Justice &amp; Protection:</p>

<p>the EU promotes justice, consumer protection, social values and helps curb climate change. EU arrest warrants and cross border policing help combat international crime and terrorism, which the UK cannot tackle alone. EU regulation is curbing banking excesses, customer rip offs (eg the EU has reduced mobile phone roaming charges and made air travel cheaper), and curbs tax avoidance. EU social legislation provides for more holidays, equal pay and a safer working environment. The UK cannot combat climate change alone !'</p>

<p>I agree with your work.</p>

<p>As for "Alone the UK, as the world's ninth largest economy ", do you mean "manufacturing economy"?</p>

<p>The UK is the world's fifth-largest economy.</p>

<p>What a lot of twaddle.<br/>And of course it assumes that we are incapable of doing anything for ourselves.......</p>

<p>Note she doesn't seem to have the pluck or ability to counter any of the posts below.</p>

<p>I have never read such a load of old cobblers in my life. This is nothing but naïve waffle. She has obviously never heard of NATO. And the EU seems to be doing its level best to ferment serious unrest across the whole of Europe. Europe has been in decline for years and is set to decline further over the next 15 to 20 years.</p>

<p>"will keep us"<br/>"us"????<br/>How dare you.</p>

<p>Julie, <br/>EU-ists have been posting this nonsense for years. You`re absurdly late with it. All your points have been rubbished many times over.<br/>Dipping in anywhere reveals it.</p>

<p>For instance, No 2 Trade, the EU sells more to us! No 5 Peace, absolute rubbish, NATO. The EU stood back and watched Yugoslavia burn. No 2 Trade, rubbish, we`re the 5th largest, not the 9th! No 4 Free movement, a straw-man, NOBODY WANTS TO STOP IMMIGRATION FOR THOSE PEOPLE WE NEED. What part of "control of immigration" do you not understand?</p>

<p> It`s all out of date hackneyed and discredited rubbish!</p>

<p>Life`s too short to quote any more.</p>

<p>Facts to Leavers is like wolfbane and crucifixes to vampires.</p>

<p>They have to turn away from them.</p>

<p>The only thing that Leavers "excel" in is unsubstantiated assertions.</p>

<p>Paraphrasing the words of Jimmy Durante, "They've got a million" (assertions). And all of them false.</p>

<p>Please BJ, not all of us leavers are as dim as the kipper leavers.</p>

<p>That's a relief. ;)</p>

<p>She obviously found an old leaflet that suits her rather warped mind.</p>

<p>If the EU was so good for jobs and growth, why is there so much unemployment and stagnation in the eurozone?</p>

<p>This is worse than a wife-beater arguing he is actually a healer!</p>

<p>It was by design.<br/>The Euro was always understood to bring economic devastation to the member countries starting with the weakest.<br/>The French believed (and may still believe despite the evidence) that the "Economic Genocide" inflicted on the PIIGS would bring them to the point where they surrendered their sovereignty in order to be "rescued". Of course, it hasn't quite worked out that way despite Merkel calling for integration on cue in 2011 and Cameron saying Integration is both inevitable and desirable. <br/>Now they cannot claim to have not anticipated the devastation the Euro would cause because their own advisers warned them of it and when one, Bernard Connoly, went public and published his book "The Rotten Heart of Europe" (well worth reading) they sacked him (how's that for open-ness and transparency).<br/>The mystery is that Germany supported the Euro when they, at least, recognised that the Euro would fail unless there was first integration. One can only assume that this is part of the ongoing Franco/German power game which the Germans usually win. Of course, sooner or later the Euro will bring down the German economy too unless thy do something before then.</p>

<p><i>"The Euro was always understood to bring economic devastation to the member countries starting with the weakest."</i></p>

<p>On the basis of never letting a good crisis go to waste, keep on manufacturing a continuous stream of crises that are beneficial to the overall objective, in other words.</p>

<p>Troll face</p>

<p>The only job Brussels is providing is yours</p>

<p>Only troll face here is yours, J-C!</p>

<p>hey! I couldn't help notice. You seem to know the Brussels crowd very well, and seem unusually familiar with francophone spelling.</p>

<p>What's your deal here? Where are you from?</p>

<p>it's not my real face</p>

<p>Coward!</p>

<p>oh i'm sorry I've disappointed you my lord</p>

<p>I hope you will see it in your heart to forgive me</p>

<p>Correct me if I am wrong but didn't Cameron say he would campaign to leave the EU if he didn't get satisfaction?<br/><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/624460/David-Cameron-leave-EU-European-Union-immigration-curbs-benefits" rel="nofollow">http://www.express.co.uk/news/...</a><br/>"The Prime Minister feels he is being “completely ignored” in his renegotiation attempts and will become the forerunner of the Out campaign if he feels he has been <br/>unsuccessful, according to sources.</p>

<p>A senior insider revealed: “He has said that if he is completely ignored or if they give him nothing he will campaign to leave. He has made that clear.”"</p>

<p>All deniable of course but this is probably the real reason for his "deal" so he can claim to have been listened to but if so, he is easily satisfied.</p>

<p>Oh, and what's this "he would stay on as prime minister if the vote is for Brexit?" Does he really think he would b the right person to lead the country if his policies are rejected not just by his own party but by the electorate? Is there no end to his self-delusion and duplicity?</p>

<p>"Correct me if I am wrong"</p>

<p>OK, you are wrong.</p>

<p>But did you not follow the link to where this was reported - and never denied?</p>

<p>It's going to be just like Dunkirk but as we know from experience, every now and again you have to get out of Europe to save it.</p>

<p>My fellow outas - if you all face the fact we're gonna lose, it may help galvanise our side and you never know we might win in the end, but it will be almost impossible</p>

<p>To those today saying I'm an imposter that really wants to stay in, look back at my posting record, I cannot stand the EU nor Liberal doo-gooder Britain, ooman rights or our dire victim creation mentality.<br/>I'd end all foreign aid today. It infantilises peoples and stunts their ambition and self reliance. Malaysia declined FA and went from dirt poor to top 25 nation by yr 2000.</p>

<p>I yearn for full autonomy and relish the bracing winds of change but we're up against the entire establishment and most of us are producing facile abstract swivel eyed arguments</p>

<p>Drama Queen,<br/>How`s the Amateur Dramatic Society these days?</p>

<p>If you did actually want out, you wouldn`t act like a cretinous troll, and constantly shoot yourself in the foot by sneaking in ridiculous phrases like "the bracing winds of change".</p>

<p>Staying in is asking for "winds of change". Turkey, Ever closer union,  more VAT. Much more VAT in fact, etc.</p>

<p>You`re not scaring anyone. Please go away.</p>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p>Because according to this theory, people are going to wake up to the fact that not only the PM has to go to Brussels to negotiate British sovereignty, but British says No. And then the PM turns back and argues it still is a good deal, for reasons completely unsubstantiated. And people say "alright then"?</p>

<p>And they forget that last year, Brussels send an ADDITIONAL demand for 1.7bn, and the PM said "no way", then wrote the cheque.</p>

<p>Do you sincerely think this is going unnoticed?.</p>

<p>"if you all face the fact we're gonna lose "</p>

<p>Say no more. Everything else is a waste of breath.</p>

<p>The EU negotiations are not over yet folks. I suspect Dave knew whatever he came up with would be deemed failure and planned accordingly. He will let all the media fuss and recriminations blow over and conspire with his EU pals to pull a couple of rabbits out of the proverbial hat in a few weeks time if not sooner. He can then say he got even more out of them, the EU apparatchiks will make some generous statements about the fabulous future of the UK in a reformed EU etc and Dave and the spin machine can go to work on the Great Undecided.</p>

<p>sorry, wrong post - my browser moved and I type by looking at the keyboard</p>

<p>apologies..</p>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p>Because according to this theory, people are going to wake up to the fact that not only the PM has to go to Brussels to negotiate British sovereignty, but British says No. And then the PM turns back and argues it still is a good deal, for reasons completely unsubstantiated.

<p>Do you sincerely think this is going unnoticed?</p>

<p>No, he has exactly what he needs. <br/>Nothing that would cause him any problems personally with the EU but a perfect excuse to not take us out even if we vote for out - he will simply say we didn't like the deal and that we would therefore stay in pending a fresh referendum (standard EU practise with unfortunate referendum outcomes) while he seeks a better deal. <br/>If he had returned with a perfectly good deal and we voted still to leave he wouldn't have a leg to stand on. <br/>His policy is not to let us decide but to let us think we have a say. His primary objective is to keep us in the EU no matter what.</p>

<p>In a leaders debate before the General Election, Nigel Farage challenged David Cameron that he was only offering a referendun due to pressure from UKIP.<br/><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/568040/Leaders-debates-seven-way-TV-hustings" rel="nofollow">http://www.express.co.uk/news/...</a></p>

<p>Having secured an unexpected majority, Mr Cameron has engaged in renegotiations in order to deliver a result that would please those of the electorate, who want a chance to scrutinise and vote on our membership of the EU. Unfortunately the fig leaf of concessions Cameron has garnered, indicate that he couldn't be trusted to deliver a newspaper, let alone any meaningful changes or reforms of the EU's structure, conduct and management. It is business as usual.</p>

<p>Mr Cameron needs to be reminded that the pro-Europeans were not campaigning for a referendum. The running has been entirely made by the 'outers'. It seems very unlikely that Mr Cameron will succeed in convincing the voters who prefer life outside of the EU regime, to think again after his renegotiations. If anything their suspicions have been reinforced.</p>

<p>Would you have voted Leave if their had been no negotiations at all?</p>

<p>What negotiations are you referring to? Surely not that fool Cameron's little laundry list of trivia?</p>

<p>The only thing which could have persuaded most of us to vote to stay is if the EU was already, of its own volition, changing itself back into a Common Market. Anything else, including the slapping Cameron got, is a step along the way to an anti-democratic federal Europe run by <i>enarques</i> and foreign technocrats.</p>

<p>Irrelevant to my question.</p>

<p>".....rather than the public – who will vote mostly on their long-held prejudices"</p>

<p>Prejudices?<br/>How about "beliefs"?<br/>Or maybe what the public, the electors, think is to be denigrated.</p>

<p>What is clear is that it is Cameron's own prejudices that are at play here. He has always been in favour of the EU "my EU right or wrong" and never had any concerns about whether or not it was fit for purpose and in need of reform nor if it had too much power. These are a consequence only of his recognising that there is a flavour of dissent at large and it is attempt to try and quench that dissent. <br/>But the reason his "deal" is of no consequence and only a promised "we'll think about it" from the EU and not a commitment. Indeed, there is no commitment nor any binding terms that require the Pm to act on the outcome of the referendum. <br/>It is all too clear that if the outcome is a vote to stay, even if by one vote, then we will stay.</p>

<p>On the other hand a vote to leave carries no obligation on the PM to actually take us out and this deal is a soft way to justify keeping us in - until another referendum in some years time. The excuse will be that we weren't really voting to leave, we just wanted a better deal. Then there is the clear and decisive vote argument. However large the proportion who vote to leave it can always be declared insufficient to constitute a clear and decisive vote. This allows for us to be kept in pending another referendum in 5-10 years time. In other words, standard EU policy when a referendum delivers and unhappy outcome,you get to take it again.</p>

<p>There are lots of other cop-outs including a myriad of "it is in our best interests" arguments to justify setting aside a vote to leave.</p>

<p>The real point of all this is not to bring MPs on side but to keep them out of the way of Cameron's objectives whether they sit on the fence or grovel at his feet.<br/>He doesn't seek to persuade them of the rightness of his cause, he just wants to persuade them to stay out of his way.</p>

<p>Viva El Presidente Cameron!</p>

<p>I have always wanted a major EU reform back to a common market and little else. No major contributions, no EU directives and certainly no open borders. Despite voting for Cameron's Conservatives and I would do so again, as there is no sensible alternative, I am less than impressed with Cameron's so-called EU reforms. He has so irritated me with his minor reforms, which have yet to be and probably won't be ratified, that I would now vote for an EU exit. We needed a strong Thatcheresque type leader, willing to negotiate hard for Britain and the main concerns of the nation: open borders, loss of sovereignty and excessive contributions.<br/>Am I afraid of exiting the EU? Not a bit. We have a huge trade deficit with the EU, so is not in their interests to impose punitive trade levies on us. We will save billions in EU contributions and we will be able to enforce our own immigration policy, including not allowing the flood of so-called refugees into Britain. If we exit the EU, the organisation is doomed, as we are a major contributor, possibly second only to Germany and the EU cannot survive without us.</p>

<p>They say that we will be subject to tarrifs &amp; therefore destitute. How can Ireland remain in the EU then if we leave? Something like 80% of their trade is with the UK. It just doesn't add up.</p>

<p>Agree. I think other nations would also step up and demand<br/>reforms for their country too, especially flow of workers and benefits. An<br/>empire needs a good clean up periodically.</p>

<p>Martin Schultz said on SKY news today that "nothings irreversible". Anything agreed before the referendum can be 'undone' after it! What more do you need to know before you understand what contempt the establishment have for us plebs? They no longer feel the need to hide it!</p>

<p>at least he's honest. Hope the LEAVE campaign puts that comment on a poster.</p>

<p>Agreed!</p>

<p>The actual British Voters have already decided to remain. They were never going to vote to leave the EU.</p>

<p>All we have here is bluster and wind from those involved, which will change 'nothing'.</p>

<p>Similar as the Scottish Referendum, there will be an even greater healthy margin % in favour of remaining, in the end.</p>

<p>Those on the losing side again, will have wasted time, energy and money on another  fool's errand.</p>

<p>I wonder what your confident if absurd assertions are based on. I doubt if you even know any 'actual British voters', and your eagerness to abuse those you disagree with rather than make any kind of positive case for the UK staying in the EU (clue: there isn't one) is typical of the EU shills and stooges who infest these comments.</p>

<p>We'll be leaving. Don't wait up, we can see ourselves out.</p>

<p>A fool's errand is the correct description. We are part of Europe, for better or worse, so lets act accordingly. Europe is the last bastion of our kind of people.</p>

<p>Well woth defending together!</p>

<p>The EU has shown that it is incapable of defending itself or its citizens. Unaccompanied children, 35,000 in Sweden alone, have simply been allowed to walk in. What chance has Europe got from defending itself if Russian tanks started rolling across the borders, when it is allowing free passage to jihadists and criminal gangs?</p>

<p>The EU and the problems it has caused to economies such as Greece is a madhouse. The UK is far better out.</p>

<p>OK - but don't expect to rejoin before bankruptcy beckons by 2040.</p>

<p>Actually, every time anyone is able to escape the financial strictures of the EU, including the ERM for example, they have been financially far better off. <br/>Even though not a part of the Euro the presumption is that we will at some time join and thus we are bound by certain constraints imposed by Maastricht.<br/>If we can finally say we won't ever join the Euro we could cast off those constraints but it would be far better to simply get out of the EU and be much better off.</p>

<p>Laughable nonsense. Our kind of people? The British don't consider themselves Europeans in the way the Germans etc. do. And I imagine you're welcoming millions of unwanted third world immigrants as well? And then in due course Turkey?</p>

<p>They might be your kind of people. They're not ours.</p>

<p>El pratto Giuliano!</p>

<p>Britain invited more 3rd-worlders to Europe than any country, followed by France, then Germany (Turks).</p>

<p>It still doesnj't alter the facty that Europe is our last bastion. I mean, look at the US!</p>

<p>We are our own last bastion and final hope.  Our desire for life ... our independence of spirit ... our love of kind ... that is where our determination to shape the political dispensation comes from; not from some two-bit neoliberal/neo-Marxist dictatorship in Brussels.</p>

<p>You're not a native English speaker. It's "similar to", not "similar as".</p>

<p>You're a sad example of how undemocratic and illegitimate (in both senses of the word) the gnomes of Brussels are....</p>

<p>Indeed. It's "when you pay for being spanked", not "getting spanked" as well...</p>

<p>It all depends upon when you pay. Before, during, or after.<br/>As in, you pay for getting drunk, not being drunk.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>For me the classic piece of comedy in all of this farcical charade, is William Hague supporting Cameron's renegotiations, after having rubbished the proposed 'Red Card' concept in a House of Commons debate back in 2008.</p>

<p>But in opposition you can get to say what you really believe rather than you have to believe.</p>

<p>I can hear and feel the conviction of Eurosceptics who want Brexit, not just on here but on TV and all other websites.</p>

<p>I feel no such passion or drive from Europhiles. Is it possible to be passionately in favour of the EU ?   I mean  really ?</p>

<p>For the nth time... please would somebody list the positive reasons or advantages of EU membership.  No, not scare stories about departure - I want to know the good things that the EU has to offer the UK in return for our money and sovereignty.</p>

<p>it provides a chance for a lucrative second career, away from the prying press, for politicians once they have completed their tour of duty on the national circuit.<br/>And it helps to negotiate against the likes of Google and Microsoft, you can harmonise patents, research, etc. but most of these things can be done by accords anyway.</p>

<p>when you pay for getting spanked, you don't necessarily go and crow about it...</p>

<p>£10 billion is an awful lot of spanking.. can't wait !</p>

<p>Voting ( Democracy) was always a neat little trick to control the populace by providing them with the illusion (delusion) that they had a say. It has proven slightly more acceptable than the use of force in the West, though far less effective than force in many other nations around the globe. The Vote on the EU is no different, it will generate a Remain result ( that's already fixed and nothing will change it) and the usual culprits will claim "it is the will of the people". History can clearly show that there is only one thing that changes which group of culprits is really in charge  - and it has never been a peaceful one!</p>

<p>"Populace".</p>

<p>what is your evidence for claiming that the result has already been fixed?</p>

<p>Losers' excuses are coming in thick and fast already. Poor sods, they are fighting for a lost cause.</p>

<p>As Dan Hodges says: "Can we stop pretending Britain might quit the EU." LMAO!!!</p>

<p>Even if isn't, history says we will have to keep voting until the EU gets the result it wants!</p>

<p>the EU cannot make us do anything. if the vote is to leave we will leave without any question.</p>

<p>Tell that to the Irish!</p>

<p>what the irish do is a matter for them. frankly i have never been able to make much sense of what irish people do.</p>

<p>" We will never leave under my watch".<br/>David Cameron.</p>

<p>he cannot overrule the wishes of the british people.</p>

<p>He can - and almost certainly will - try.</p>

<p>how?</p>

<p>I doubt it.</p>

<p>Ask his cabinet ministers - they have learnt what he means by democracy, "Do as I say or ..... no job and no constituency".</p>

<p>We all have one vote in the referendum, and a secret one at that.</p>

<p>When did he say that?</p>

<p>In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, David Cameron said "that under David Cameron and the Conservatives, Britain will never leave the European Union".<br/>As reported in the Daily Mail 19 July 2012.</p>

<p>Thanks for that. In the telegraph interview, Cameron does not say what you assert.</p>

<p>He says we will never leave. What more do you need to know?</p>

<p>He actually says that he would never campaign for an out vote. That is not the same thing at all. You made a false assertion again.</p>

<p>That guy is one of the leading time-wasters, winders-up and provocateurs in online commenting.</p>

<p>He is in a group, including:<br/>-TheRealMrBlobbysRevenge<br/>-steve3005<br/>-fla56<br/>-EllieMae's Grandad<br/>-alexw<br/>-observer20<br/>-poohsticks<br/>-Michael Clarke<br/>-neil<br/>-borisforpm<br/>-The Browning Version<br/>etc</p>

<p>I give up!</p>

<p>I do not believe the EU will accept a Leave result. We will have to vote again until we get it right</p>

<p>the EU cannot make us do anything. if the vote is to leave we will leave without any question.</p>

<p>“It doesnt matter how many people vote, only who counts them.”</p>

<p>That is apocryphal.</p>

<p>Stalin would have approved of the South Thanet result then in the General Election</p>

<p>Farage complained, then shut up, after making unsubstantiated allegations, no official complaint.</p>

<p>Farage claimed irregularities over Oldham, claiming an unimpeachable source, no official complaint.</p>

<p>Farage claimed that the wheels on his car had been tampered with, alleging words from a mechanic, no official complaint, withdrew his claims saying it was a "mistake".</p>

<p>what a ridiculous comment. this is britain not the soviet union.</p>

<p><i>"this is britain not the soviet union."</i></p>

<p>If the likes of you have their way, it bloody soon will be indistinguishable from it.</p>

<p>“The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.”</p>

<p>No, but Russia is!</p>

<p>Kippers cannot reconcile their bemoaning the so-called lack of democracy in the EU, with their unbridled support for Putin.</p>

<p>Go figure.</p>

<p>He likes things to fit his view of the world.</p>

<p>Then you are misled. </p>

<p>Experience.<br/>.<br/>It doesn't matter if it is or isn't.<br/>Like Ireland, we will have another go to get it right, if necessary.</p>

<p>Do read up on the history of the Irish referenda.</p>

<p>That is an argument for force rather than votes.</p>

<p>The way things are going in the rest of Europe - especially Germany, the use of force by the populace to maintain democracy is rapidly becoming inevitable.</p>

<p>And that is an argument for anarchy.</p>

<p>Liberal  constitutions tend to grant the possibility for the people to impose correctives of an extra-franchise nature to bad law by bad government.</p>

<p>No, it is not.</p>

<p>It is an argument for the retention of democracy in the face of forces whose intent is to remove it.</p>

<p>Who decides, pray tell, what is right and wrong in your vision? You are arguing that the end justifies the means.</p>

<p>So your view is that we as a nation should not resist an attempt to destroy some centuries' worth of democratic progress, including fighting two major wars, and submit to rule from a foreign power without raising a finger to prevent it?</p>

<p>Yes, I really believe you do.</p>

<p>I will be voting OUT even should the commissars in Brussels agree, without reservation, to Cameron's wishy-washy demands, agree to desist from putting their collective fingers in the EU till and to become democratic. So perhaps I might be accused of prejudice, xenophobia and being a little Englander, but in my mind I am a patriot, a democrat and a lover of freedom and the British way of life, unlike Cast Iron Dave</p>

<p>Prejudice? I wouldn’t actually call it that! What I noticed when my kids were at school in the 1980’s, was that they were getting brain-washed into being Europhiles! That still hasn’t worn off for one of them.</p>

<p>What I urge everyone to do is turn up when the count of the Referendum polls is being done! Check carefully that we get a true figure! The last one, we eventually heard, had 63% voting to remain in the EU, but I have only ever spoken with seven people who said they did!</p>

<p>Lots of people, including me, voted IN in `75. They say so on the net all the time. But they were voting for the "Common Market", as it was universally referred to by the media, NOT an EU.<br/> NOT political union. It was specifically stated that it would NOT lead to political union.</p>

<p>Anyway turn up where? Check what?</p>

<p>People will vote Professor on their long held experience of the EU, not prejudice as you suggest.</p>

<p>Maybe the learned Professor thinks it is unjust to judge the EU by events in the Eurozone and migrants.   Just not cricket.</p>

<p><b>Draft EU deal gives boost to Leave campaign</b> - <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/04/eu-referendum-leave-leads-nine/" rel="nofollow">https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016...</a><br/></p>

<p>The result will be decided by fear and apathy.</p>

<p>Those determined to leave will be the more likely to vote, but may be outnumbered by those who believe the Brexit scare stories, which will doubtlessly increase as the referendum approaches.</p>

<p>We can only hope the apathy of those who are scared or indifferent, will work in favour of Brexit.</p>

<p>That is why Rose has resorted to saying it is all a forgone conclusion. He will fail of course.</p>

<p>Sadly you are probably right</p>

<p>I venture to think that the poor quality of Cameron's 'concessions' and the slippery way in which he dodges difficult questions will tilt some 'undecideds' into the 'Leave' camp. <br/>There are also EUphiles who were hoping for some genuine reform. They are disappointed.<br/>This article perhaps has the hidden agenda of trying to protect Cameron from criticism.</p>

<p>i suspect that camerons slick PR machine will persuade a lot of people that we should stay in.</p>

<p>His skills in the PR department should not be under-rated but I have the sense that he has been 'rumbled'.</p>

<p>by and large the british people prefer the status quo.<br/>most people have never known a time when we were not in the EU and leaving would be a leap into the unknown. i suspect that this deal - however second rate it may be - will be enough and when it comes to the crunch they will stick with what they are used to warts and all.</p>

<p>We weren't in the EU on Dec 30th 1992.<br/>I can remember that far back.<br/>.<br/>There is no option to "stick with what we know!" <br/>The EU will change beyond all recognition in the next ten years.<br/>If we are still in, we will have no choice but to go along with it.</p>

<p>well that is the challenge for the leave campaign. to persuade the voters that staying in will be too bad for britain. i still think that most voters will be persuaded otherwise.</p>

<p>You may be right, but they would be wrong</p>

<p>there is no right or wrong in this matter. that is why it is so difficult to evaluate.</p>

<p>Edward Heath, January 1973:</p>

<p>"“there are some in this country who fear that in going into Europe we shall in some way sacrifice independence and sovereignty. These fears, I need hardly say, are completely unjustified”.</p>

<p>February 2016:</p>

<p>Elected British Prime Minister David Cameron struggles to get permission from the Polish Prime Minister to implement one of the policies in his own government's manifesto.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/05/polish-pm-backs-parts-david-cameron-eu-renegotiation-beata-szydlo" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/pol...</a></p>

<p>We need to vote Leave.</p>

<p>britain is still a fully independent and sovereign nation. we can do whatever we like including breaking treaties and telling the EU to get stuffed.</p>

<p>When have we done this</p>

<p>Henry VIII in 1518 was the last time?</p>

<p>Cameron's so-called renegotiation has been pointless. He asked for too little and didn't even achieve it. In any case, the EU will debate our renegotiation after a vote to REMAIN, and will then either turn it down flat (most likely) or debate it out of existence. Cameron takes us all for fools and he is wrong. I'm sure that people have already decided. Those who 'cling to nurse for fear pf something worse' will vote to REMAIN. The rest of us who want out have plenty of reasons for wanting to LEAVE and will vote accordingly. Naturally, there will be a few people who aren't sure (as is their right) who will try to reason it all out based on the various arguments thrown around and Cameron's farcical negotiations. Well, best of luck with that!</p>

<p>This is rubbish. Yes, of course most people have decided, but the referendum will be decided by the people who have yet to make up their mind, just like elections.</p>

<p>Very true and there is evidence to suggest that the vote will be decided by turnout, which is predicted to be low.<br/>That suggests to me if the turnout is low, it will favour out, purely on the basis of the outers being more committed to the cause.<br/>Remember the outcome of the 2014 Euro Election?</p>

<p>Indeed. I will be voting out 3 times. Once for me &amp; 2 times for my daughters abroad.</p>

<p>Single voter registration has put paid to that, sorry to disappoint you.</p>

<p>I have both of their proxy votes. Sorry to disappoint you. Your turn.</p>

<p>Proxy votes can only be applied for, for specific elections or referendums, so as no one knows the date of the EU Referendum, you are telling porkies again.<br/>Making a fraudulent proxy vote application is illegal and subject to penalties.<br/>Your turn, oh forget it.</p>

<p>Oh by the way, I forgot to mention. Your point about proxy votes can only be applied for specific elections or referendums. Wrong in so many ways. Explain to me, why my father voted for me on 3 elections &amp; one referendum, despite me assigning him my proxy only once, whilst I served in the RN in the 70's. How foolish do you feel now?</p>

<p>Because I have looked at the proxy voting application form, "last year the way we register to vote changed, you must be registered under the new system".<br/>"only electors who are (or will be) registered individually for a particular election or referendum are entitled to vote by proxy at that election or referendum".<br/>Looks pretty clear to me, what happened to proxy voters for service personnel in the 70s I have no idea but if you want to vote by proxy for your wife and two daughters now, good luck.</p>

<p>I see you are looking at the wrong proxy voting application. The one for overseas UK citizens is different. It allows you to register a proxy for an individual election, for a set time, or all future elections &amp; Referendums. I think the key was to have read my original post. The one where I stated my daughters were abroad.<br/>Check it out. I just have again. This time read the correct proxy application form.</p>

<p>So if I am understanding you correctly, your two daughters who live abroad have applied for you to vote by proxy in the in/out referendum for them and your wife has done the same  who presumably lives with you? If not what is her status?<br/>If that is correct, can you tell me when these proxy votes were granted and how long do they last for?</p>

<p>Do you have problems reading? I never mentioned my wife in relation to proxys. My daughters have used the overseas proxy appilcation form, to allow me to vote for them by proxy indefinitely, for all elections &amp; referendums. Just like the form allows them to. My wife will vote for herself. it is easier to get to the polls for her, than from the other side of the earth, where my daughters are.<br/>Have you managed to actually read the overseas electors proxy application form yet &amp; associated notes?<br/>By the way. What part of indefinite are you having a problem with?<br/>Tell me you are not a teacher please.</p>

<p>You are so wrong yet again. If you are abroad, either as working, or travelling, you may register as an overseas voter, or as a voter at any constituency you might have a close contact. Both my daughters have registered online &amp; both nominated me as there proxy for any election, or referendum which may occur during their registration period. It is no different to registering in the UK, where one registers to vote &amp; can also register a proxy separately at the same time. The reason I know this? Both my daughters have done it. Unless you no better than the government registration people &amp; online system. Try again, I have actual facts &amp; actual votes. I even voted by proxy for both of them at the last general election, using exactly the same method. Why is it that people just cannot admit they are wrong, after all do you actually have experience of using the registration &amp; proxy system?</p>

<p>That's the way.</p>

<p>Vote early, and vote often!</p>

<p>&amp; all perfectly legal.</p>

<p>Exactement!</p>

<p>Turnouts of the last few national elections.<br/>Scottish Independence Sept. 2014, can't remember exact number but over 90%, 2014 Euro Election 35%, 2015 GE 66%, 2016 EU Referendum, could be anything.</p>

<p>Basically, elections are won by those who really want to vote &amp; there is no group more motivated than the Brexit voter.<br/>Vote for nothing to change, hardly a motivator, is it?</p>

<p>That's true but consider the result of the Scottish Independence Referendum, it's a bit of a conundrum.</p>

<p>The Scottish referendum is similar, but at the same time different.<br/>Language, shared heritage, currency, armed forces, economy, shear numbers of people in each other's country. For instance all the English in Scotland got the vote, but with the exception of Irish, no EU citizens get the vote. </p>

<p>It would be so great to have a prime minister that wasn't a self-interested coward.<br/></p>

<p>"...the public – who will vote mostly on their long-held prejudices".</p>

<p>Typical academic: patronising, arrogant myopic fool, comfortably ensconced in the groves of academe and utterly disconnected with the real World.</p>

<p>Surely, the British public will vote, shortly, and hopefully, from a mixture of political distrust, day to day experience of the affects of being in the EU and the mounting despair of being totally in thrall to unelected non-democratic commissioners and empire building totalitarianists?</p>

<p>The Professor may well adore the concept of bonding with Turkey et al, which would clearly exacerbate the already rapidly growing social problems with Islamists: personally, I would never ever wish to be joined to Turkey in any way.</p>

<p>Ask a Greek Cypriot...</p>

<p>ISIL control some of Eastern Turkey. The border with Iraq mainly.</p>

<p>I think you make his point for him, with your obviously long-held prejudices about academics, about Europe... :-)</p>

<p>Sadly Mikey, I also am an academic and ex BSchool external moderator and examiner and sometime lecturer, who learned about the splendid isolation of enured academic from the real World...</p>

<p>You, however...</p>

<p>I think he was using "prejudices" in the technical sense, ie an already-decided position. It reads quite well that way.</p>

<p>Turkey Planning Military Invasion in Syria</p>

<p>Lets hope people will be protesting outside Turkey embassies waving their banner "Hands of Syria"</p>

<p>wrong forum buddy.</p>

<p>and if you had a bit of acuity, you'd have picked up that by now people in the West are getting a little bored, if not p*ssed off, by the endless and senseless ongoings of middle-easter "dune punks"...</p>

<p>Seems like changing minds is just what it did, if polls mean anything.</p>

<p>Can someone please tell David Cameron to stop flogging a dead horse.  The British people have given the EU a fair go.  They don't like it.  They want to remain British, not European.  They are fed up seeing the nation being de-Britishised, and they have decided they are not going to take it anymore.</p>

<p>Actually I want him to keep flogging this dead horse. As we can see by the rapidly improving polls for Brexit, every time he tries to do a Blair, he shoots himself in the foot. Praise the lord &amp; pass the ammunition, to borrow from another revolution, against an out of touch elite.</p>

<p>They haven't decided anything yet!</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to get a vote on EU I voted against it then based CAP nothing has changed I will vote out because of CAP and Freedom of Movement, there is never going to be any change with either of these, for me these are the two major issues with the EU. I have seen FoM change my region dramatically and not for the better, the effect on public services is bad, the governments response to the issue? to cut funding to public services. I am not against some limited immigration or migrants coming for a better life but it needs to be managed and more importantly funded.</p>

<p>Turkey Planning Military Invasion in Syria</p>

<p>Lets hope people will be protesting outside Turkey embassies waving their banner "Hands of Syria"</p>

<p>That's the second time you've made the same mistake. It's "hands off Syria".</p>

<p>How it is prejudice to have an opinion about the EU at my age?? I'm 46 and have never been given a vote.</p>

<p>President Schulz, President Tusk, President Juncker all three men serving NOW as presidents it he EU commission, union and council all three unelected by YOU and me. All three men anti UK all three staunch federalists. Wake up.</p>

<p>Purely on the unelected point: why do you think that we should be involved in the election of these three posts?</p>

<p>Not only that but if anything the European parliament should be able to table directives. Because at the moment, it is essentially a rubberstamping assembly. They can vote on laws but they cannot table them. A bit like North Korea or the Ussr of old.  The preparation f text is the prerogative of the commission - which is unelected as you know, and operates behind closed door - and wins Nobel Peace Prizes. That last point is frankly hilarious....</p>

<p>You haven't answered the question. Why should members of the public be involved in electing heads of institutions?</p>

<p>i don't think it matters a great deal whether these power-crazed, privileged and deluded bureaucrats are elected directly or not.  The point is that there is no European nation.  You can't have effective government without effective press. And nations were created in the crucible of war. <br/>The lack of transparency in Brussels is caused numerous unforced errors. The whole thing was driven in the eighties by French Socialists and thus has a deep heritage of deception, profligacy and cynicism. Since it has slipped its leash and is now a preserve of an international intelligencia, that lives free of taxes and worldly worries. Scheming pet projects and playing the hapless nations that pay for it against each other.<br/>But Brussels is incapable of prosperity, or war or even sense. It is intolerant, self-absorbed and increasingly derided.</p>

<p>They have power over you.<br/>The question is why would you not want to be involved.</p>

<p>You didn't vote for the PM though, unless the PU are one of his constituents. The point is that these posts are decided by election within the institutions themselves. They are not plebiscites.</p>

<p>And who elected the institutions?</p>

<p>We voted for the MEPs. The rest of it is infrastructure.</p>

<p>The difference is that Dave is head of the party that won a majority of the votes in the UK only election and voters knew that part of the deal (if you voted Tory) was Dave as PM. In Euroland we are one of 28, not one of one. Yes we can vote for MEPs, but beyond that we are simply a tiny minority with frankly little influence on our own.</p>

<p>Indeed. So why the complaint that "nobody asked us"? They never would.</p>

<p>Scumbag Schultz, windbag Tusk and winebag Juncker, puh-leaze</p>

<p>It's one thing to tell a survey "I've had enough of the EU, I want out" and another to vote that way when faced with a life-changing decision in the voting booth. I dislike the way we are treated in the EU and think we'll be better off out, but do I really want to gamble on my children's futures?</p>

<p>The Leave campaign has to produce a plan and vision for a UK outside the EU and argue how that will be better to staying in.  We need someone of substance to stand up, get the Leave campaigns pulling together and produce a viable alternative to the status quo so voters have a proper choice.</p>

<p>Dale, you are very bad at pretending to be a "Leaver" Please stop. <br/>If you really do think we`d be better off out, as you say here, then it`s not a "gamble". Is it. That`s your own logic!</p>

<p>Of course it is. The question is how much of a gamble it is.</p>

<p>Wuss.</p>

<p>All right then, less of a gamble, if we`d be "better off out", as he states above. I`m just following his own logic! His!</p>

<p>Everything is a gamble anyway, IN, OUT, getting up in the morning, crossing the road. </p>

<p>Pro EU folk like the word 'gamble' as it implies some degree of recklessness.</p>

<p>We stood alone in 1940. You people need to grow a pair.</p>

<p>What on earth does your comment have to do with the question at hand?</p>

<p>It was a gamble &amp; not a forgone conclusion. The upper classes &amp; establishment were all for capitulation. That's what.</p>

<p>Ah. So you think we are living in 1940....</p>

<p>He who ignores the lessons of the errors of the past, is doomed to repeat them. He merely points out that we were capable to stand alone before &amp; can again + the usual suspects are spouting the same rhetoric. IE capitulation &amp; collaberation.</p>

<p>I understood his point, but it has little to do with a referendum on membership of the eu. We are not at war.</p>

<p>No, but we are fighting for a nation state, against an EU monolith.</p>

<p>Rediculous, the analogy you should consider is this; escaping the EU is like running out of a burning building, you don't need to check the costs / benefits of the decision.</p>

<p>Be honest, you are an IN troll.</p>

<p>Yep, the gamble being that you run out and might get hit by an asteroid. I think I'll take that risk.</p>

<p>The gamble would be choosing to stay in.</p>

<p>You are arguing that imprisoned men and women must prove the value of freedom before you will join them in it.</p>

<p>We are the British people - at least, we native Brits are - and we have given more to this world than any other people alive.  Why doubt our capacities?  Just demand that we are set free to express them.</p>

<p>"we have given more to this world than any other people alive" zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz<br/>Britiain has done many great things, and many not so great things, so have many other countries. <br/></p>

<p>We British gave the world modern parliamentary democracy, and have fought to defend it. We gave the world the agricultural and industrial revolutions and, thereby, modernity itself. We invented the USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand ... and practically every sport the wider world plays. Our contribution to humanity is unparalleled in modern times.</p>

<p>We need no foreigners to "help" us get by, thanks very much.</p>

<p>Yes and apparently we needed the Human Rights Act (thanks Blair) because we needed some European hand holding in that department.</p>

<p>Some sense in this debate rather than hysterical mis-information. Thank you.</p>

<p>The Leave campaign(s) will have to paint a realistic picture future of the future. That was one of the reasons that the SNP lost the independence referendum, they had no answers to basic questions so their position looked dodgy to say the least.</p>

<p>Well at least Leavers won't have to explain what currency they intend to adopt!!</p>

<p>Or indead that they will save nearly £10 billion a year on net contributions.</p>

<p>The writer of this article may be a very clever professor but he seems to have missed recent polls showing that a third of voters have NOT decided but have yet to make up their minds.</p>

<p>God preserve us from experts.</p>

<p>There is a silver lining to LEAVE loosing the vote;<br/>More and more thoroughly right wing parties are rising to power (often in co-alition) across Europe and perhaps this might rub-off on us, and we could end up being non so liberal lilly livered when it comes to immigration? I visit Austria and France and people I know cannot stand all the immigration and want an Aussie style processing holding camp set up in a desert far away. The Liberal elite British would never do this, but if the EU states out vote us.............</p>

<p>Ah!  Finally! The desperate, perversely convoluted imaginings of an EU-ist!</p>

<p>You have a point there.</p>

<p>Yes but the liberal elites control the voting system.</p>

<p>And how do they do that?</p>

<p>just get us out of the cesspool that europe is becoming, they need us more than we need them, of course they are still going to trade with us, to think otherwise is madness, we would also open up new and old trading partners and regain our fishing grounds. i admit it would be hard at first but not for long and we have to look at the long term, europe is descending into anarchy and war will not be far off</p>

<p>Cameron will not allow the Leave vote to win.<br/>If the polls suggest the vote to be going that way then the result will be rigged to be very close, but miraculously, a small win for the Remain campaign.<br/>His career is on the line, there's no way he'll let us leave.</p>

<p>Another silly swivel eyed point.</p>

<p>The reason Cameron will win is his camp is making the arguments, whilst my camp is barely visible and not making the arguments about the things everyday people are concerned about.</p>

<p>The more we make swivel eyed abstract irrelevant points, the more we loose.<br/>Why not instead focus on the benefits independent nations enjoy, such as Australia and S Korea and how they have no problem exporting to the world and having a full say on global stage matters and full border control?</p>

<p>Why not focus on the fact tiny nations like NZ and Iceland have trade deals across the world, which demonstrate we will easily do the same and better?<br/>No one cares about Camerons career, they care about their wallets, their everyday experience</p>

<p>You underestimate the honesty of the British public. Yes they want to hear the arguments but they also like a fair fight.</p>

<p>It is 'lose' not loose.</p>

<p>Leave is not your camp.  You are here arguing for Cameron whilst professing to be a Leaver.</p>

<p>Trojan horses are not required.  Kindly desist.</p>

<p>And you can wipe off your mascara while you are at it,</p>

<p>I'm the most outey outta there is!<br/>I'd end all immigration and send we already have most back</p>

<p>And how do you think that he can rig the result of what will be the most scrutinised referendum in our history? </p>

<p>Maybe a few ballot boxes will disappear for six hours happened before.</p>

<p>I don't know, vote stuffing, electronic votes, postal votes, he has too much to loose that I wouldn't put anything past him. He has so much power, security services, GCHQ, bankers, Bilderberg, oligarchs</p>

<p>Corbyn the whole world to join, no borders with Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, whole of Africa and anyone else who wants to come here.</p>

<p>No questions asked, no documents checked, everyone gets a free house, free car, free 58" flat screen tv, no council tax, no tax, not required to work and life off the benefits and free money £2,000/month living allowance and uncapped benefits.</p>

<p>And Cologne style living where women are blamed for living.</p>

<p></p>

<p>What is you people's obsession with flat screen TVs? when you were younger I guess you ranted about prisoners having colour TV. I love your obsession with the minutiae whilst getting the big things completely wrong and way out of proportion.</p>

<p>You are being hysterical. He wants Turkey in. That`s a fact.</p>

<p>What's wrong with Turkey?</p>

<p>"No Turkey in Europe" does not mean "No turkey in Europe."</p>

<p>Not much if it stays in Turkey.</p>

<p>Leave.</p>

<p>The EU is incapable of meaningful reform.</p>

<p>Your line of reasoning: The EU refuses to dance to our whistle and we don't feel appreciated enough. Hence we will put our jobs and economy in danger by leaving.</p>

<p>Never ceases to amaze me how anyone can trot out this tired old line. The EU is economically moribund, whereas there are any number of robust economies outside the EU.  The only people with jobs at risk are those whose snouts are buried deep inside the EU trough. I have no sympathy for these Quislings.</p>

<p>Well the snouts in the trough are of course Quisling Farage and his cronies, which explains why he is doing such a good job helping IN.</p>

<p>The idea that we can just switch over 30 to 40% of our exports to other countries is of course pure insanity.</p>

<p>The economic argument for leaving the EU is non-existent at best.</p>

<p>In 1972 I met an English woman who married a Dutchman and had lived there for some time.  She said that in Britain, you could do anything that was not expressly forbidden by law, whereas on the continent you could only do what was expressly permitted by government.</p>

<p>Alas, 44 years in 'Europe' have changed Britain--we now have quangos enforcing EU directives, and we can't make a bat's squeak of protest.  We haven't quite got to the stage where we have to get permission to move to a different address, but we're getting there.</p>

<p>In France, I am told, if you wish to form a little club - say, to go roaming the countryside - you have to notify the authorities and get permission!!</p>

<p>Cameron wants Turkey to join, with its porous Eastern border with Iraq, which is ISIL country.</p>

<p>no one else wants them , you can,t  trust them</p>

<p>why does boydave want turkey in?</p>

<p>Quite. You tell me.</p>

<p>Cameron's handling of his " renegotiation " must leadw any thoughtful person to vote for exit.<br/>Well done Mr Cameron.</p>

<p>Funny how the Brexit folks think Britain votes from a position of strength, when in fact its the opposite. Many will be somewhat less enthusiastic once they realize that jobs are going to disappear, house prices crash, and life in Britain will get a whole lot more expensive...</p>

<p>All of that and a lot worse happened after we failed to join the euro.</p>

<p>Oh, no, hang on, it didn't happen, it was just predicted that it would.</p>

<p>What is the factual basis for the statement ' life in Britain will get a whole lot more expensive...'?</p>

<p>houses are way over priced anyway , ask any estate agent</p>

<p>Surely much lowered house prices would be a huge boost for the young of our country? Strange that if house prices fall you still feel able to predict a 'whole lot more expensive' UK!</p>

<p>Euro super state lovers need to get over themselves</p>

<p>what do you think a sterling crisis will do to inflation and interest rates?</p>

<p>You are sounding increasingly desperate my friend! Increased competitiveness via say a 10% 'devaluation' would be welcomed by many old chum and so what if interest rates rise to say 1% - wow what a terrible thought. Now if you were discussing an end to the debilitating mass uncontrolled immigration from the east then maybe people might listen.</p>

<p>If house prices really do crash, everyone under the age of 30 will be eternally grateful.  Hard to see how this is going to make life in Britain a whole lot more expensive--especially considering how much we pay to support the legions of bureaucrats in Brussels.</p>

<p>Corbyn went to meet Benefits Claimants in Calais, had a party and boogie danced the night away. <br/>Interestingly he did not take his wife with him. What was he afraid of?</p>

<p>Let's waste no more time (or money) waiting for the referendum. Get on with it, the sooner the better, then we can take control of our own borders and put a stop to the madness of the EU.</p>

<p>None of us voted for Angela Merkel, yet she seems to have more control over our laws, and borders, than David Cameron does right now.</p>

<p>We're sick of being told to obey laws that were not made in our own country.</p>

<p>Send the criminals back to their own countries and stop any more entering. Stop foreigners abusing our system.</p>

<p>Britain should be run by the British for the British. If immigrants don't like our laws then they can leave.</p>

<p>We have continuously put more in to the EU than we have got out of it.</p>

<p>Time to VOTE NOW.</p>

<p>MIGRATION AND BENEFITS<br/>No change.</p>

<p>SOVEREIGNTY<br/>The letter recognises that the UK "is not committed to further political integration into the European Union - known as can kicking<br/>Red Card system - absolutely worthless</p>

<p>ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE<br/>British taxpayers' money can never be liable to support the eurozone;<br/><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6d92bbe2-2b04-11e5-8613-e7aedbb7bdb7.html#axzz3zIYZ86SH" rel="nofollow">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6d92...</a><br/>Of course it won't.</p>

<p>COMPETITIVENESS<br/>The EU will increase efforts to cut bureaucracy. HaHa</p>

<p>Note: the word "prejudice" is used only once on this page, in the strapline by the DT writer who thinks the public are unthinking idiots who will decide without the benefit of evidence or reason. I may have missed it........</p>

<p>However, the highly educated prof then suggests:</p>

<p>"If understanding the details of the renegotiation package are required to vote, the turnout would fall to 10 percent or lower."<br/>So he thinks that less than 10% are bright enough to "understand" the highly complex negotiated package that DC came up with! Well, whether he's right or wrong, in my view understanding the outcome of an irrelevant charade will not affect voter turnout, so to that extent I agree with him. Insulting the "outers" is going to be counterproductive for the Remain camp, but maybe they're not as bright as they like to think they are (or maybe they are collectively spitting their dummies).</p>

<p>He might apply the same argument to our MPs - that if understanding the details are required to vote possibly only 5% of MPs would vote. <br/>If we restrict ourselves to cameron then 0% is the figure. I am quite sure he understands nothing because he really isn't that bright. (This is the man whose PPE from Oxford failed to enlighten him as to what the Magna Carta was).<br/>PS it is worth noting that most Brussels documents have to be simplified for MPs to understand them. I forget who it was that compiled these documents, but I'm sure someone can remind us.</p>

<p>The learned professor thinks we need to be qualified to understand the deal cameron has achieved (or has been sort of promised or been promised will be "thought about") which is about the same as requiring us all to be qualified auto mechanics before being allowed to drive or suitably qualified TV experts before we are allowed to watch TV. <br/>No, we don't necessarily need that degree of understanding, just a sense of smell so we can smell the BS and act accordingly.</p>

<p>The Professor himself is prejudiced in his tone and narrative. LOL</p>

<p>absolutely</p>

<p>The author of this piece of course works for a pro-Brussels outfit, 'The UK in a Changing Europe' that merely pretends to be independent.<br/>The clue is in his use of the word 'prejudices' rather than 'views'...</p>

<p>Yes, the electorate could be divided into two camps:<br/>1) anti-EU with their long held prejudices<br/>2) pro-EU with the strength of their convictions to do what they think is right<br/>for us, the country and the EU.</p>

<p>But what's in a word like "prejudices"?</p>

<p>Of course it might be better to declare that the anti-EU camp have the strength of their convictions and the pro-EU camp their long held prejudices......</p>

<p>Not so. He is arguing that both sides have prejudices.</p>

<p>I have to disagree with the headline, while ignoring the lack of logic in the second half (All and Most cannot co-exist in the same context)</p>

<p>Camerons negotiations have certainly changed my mind. For some time I have hovered around the cusp. hopeful the deal would be clear enough for me to tilt towards staying in. Well it is clear enough and for me there can n longer be any doubt. We need to get out before membership destroys this country.</p>

<p>The 'deal ' is laughable. Camerons response no different from the brazen lies we were told by Ted Heath and Wilson when assuring us this was no more than a trading partnership. There is no meaningful deal. We have nothing. The unelected leaders of the EU are so cock sure of their power that they did not feel the need to move one inch towards our already quite limited demands. All they have been prepared to do is offer a lot of fancy phrases and pretence at negotiation then leave Cameron to make the best of a soggy paper bag of nothing.</p>

<p>That means only one thing. The moment this country votes yes they will do all they can to drive us into the dirt and make our parliamentary democracy even less relevant than it is already. No doubt supported by MP's eager to ensure their gravy train jobs are waiting there for them when then get kicked out.</p>

<p>So Cameron has changed one mind at least. It is leave for me.</p>

<p>If I might be permitted to put forward ONE ARGUMENT.<br/>If we examine the effect of EU's handling of the two major crisis of recent years.<br/>1. The 'Euro Crisis'. How have the EU economies grown since 2007? How much has European industry and commerce INCREASED employment - especially youth employment? Is there any evidence of increasing harmony and stability in the Euro Currency recently (ie between Greece, Spain and say Germany)?<br/>2. What SENSIBLE solutions have been put forward for helping the Refugee Crisis?<br/>Only a very ill thought out spasm from Merkel which has done nothing but harm to the refugees as well alienating significant public opinion to their cause! Meanwhile, dead babies will continue to be washed up on European shores.<br/>3.Not to mention issues like 'The Crimea' (something else Merkel has badly misunderstood), Merkel's knee jerk cancellation of the German fast breeder R&amp;D - good science and valuable engineering wasted to pander to her own 'anxt'.<br/>4. "A camel is a horse designed by a committee"<br/>We do not need professorial guidance, when the arguments flow so easily from the FACTS of experience.</p>

<p>"Angst".</p>

<p>ARE YOU DEAF? </p>

<p>Well at least you're trying....<br/>But still these are abstract points that mean nothing to the people standing watching their kids play footie on a Sunday morning.<br/>They need to know what effect leave will have on their wallets, their ability to have a place in Spain, the customs queue time etc. Real things that affect their parochial selves</p>

<p>You forgot to mention how long it will take to get housing, how much wages will be depressed by competition from impoverished immigrants, and whether their kids will go to a school that is recognisably British.</p>

<p>I've a house in Spain and it will still be there when we leave the EU. I'll still be able to go on holiday and even retire there. Nothing will change except showing my passport. <br/>Unfortunately the scaremongers will say otherwise and may even be believed.</p>

<p>They will see that Turkey joining will affect "their parochial selves".</p>

<p>That is four questions. What is the argument?</p>

<p>I suppose one may make four points to put forward a single argument? And - reading between the lines without point scoring - I think the poster is saying the EU is not much use at solving any problems that arise, whether economic or social, and its solutions - by committee - tend to be mongrel and useless.</p>

<p>The despised by the elite, non-elite, ordinary people in other words, will see that voting for the status quo, is NOT an option. Especially when actual facts are given to them.</p>

<p>Like Cameron`s wooing of Turkey to join by 2025. Isil will then have EU passports if they want them.</p>

<p>The first refuge of a Labour fascist and guardian reader is the slander and libel sheet.</p>

<p>Want to leave the EU? You must be a racist.</p>

<p>Want to control the borders? You must be a racist.</p>

<p>Want to fly the Union Flag? You must be  a racist.</p>

<p>Want to fly the St George Flag? You must be a racist.</p>

<p>Want your children to learn about English and British history at school as they used to? You must be a racist.</p>

<p>And what's more the Labour Party Blackshirts who turn up to throw bottles and bricks at police, shop windows and anybody with different ideas call everybody else fascists and nazis.</p>

<p>What a twisted little organisation it is.</p>

<p>Nazi</p>

<p>ˈnɑːtsi/</p>

<p>noun historical</p>

<p>A member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party.</p>

<p>I keep having to point out that Hitler was a socialist too!</p>

<p>His party was a socialist party but he got rid of them.</p>

<p>Krupps and all the rest made sure of that.</p>

<p>Mussolini also called himself a socialist as did Stalin.</p>

<p>Between them all they certainly managed to make life and death a misery for millions of people.</p>

<p>Hitler also called himself a socialist. He was against International socialism (Bolshevism) and for a German National Socialism (Nazism).</p>

<p>Socialism and Despotism have always been inextricably linked.</p>

<p>Tory cabinet ministers who vote to stay in will do so purely because it will support  their own best interests.</p>

<p>Doesn't everyone do that?</p>

<p>College lads again at it again...the Old Boy preferential network over politics.</p>

<p>Nonsense.</p>

<p>Another swiveleyed argument doing the rounds. Wont win a single wavering voter round.</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>It's all the swivel eyed political anorak stuff that will cause us to loose.</p>

<p>Most people on my side are using these swiveleyed more or less meaningless abstractions in place of proper argument</p>

<p>Yep. That and the "keep the gene pool pure" nonsense.</p>

<p>Or their views.</p>

<p>No, their interests. Their personal views are far less important than their personal bank balance.</p>

<p>You know this from personal experience of course.</p>

<p>How's about the expenses scandal? They probably don't personally agree with theft, but were quite happy to undertake activities that were, in essence, theft from the public. I think it's quite clear that most politicians are now career professionals whose first priority is their career. You don't have to know them personally to see this.</p>

<p>In the vast majority of cases, the expense were used as a tacit form of supplementary pay, and in most cases claims were approved. Only in a handful of cases was there fraud, and those people were punished. Having said that, the moral issue raised by the use of expenses is an important matter. <br/>I think that the argument that people will vote to secure preferment for themselves is a weak one. There is way too much scrutiny nowadays for blatant rigging to succeed, and in any event, these individuals only have one vote.</p>

<p>One tiny example. I had a hospital appointment yesterday which was running pathetically late as always. I found out that an Eastern European with an interpreter came in with no appointment, and jumped the queue (this wasn't A&amp;E where no appointment is necessary).</p>

<p>This person jumped the queue for two reasons:<br/>1. The NHS was paying for the interpreter and it's expensive<br/>2. They tick some diversity box.</p>

<p>People are tired of being 2nd class citizens in their own land, and will hopefully vote accordingly.</p>

<p>'People are tired of being 2nd class citizens in their own land, and will hopefully vote accordingly'.</p>

<p>I wish it were so, but the reality is people in the end will be too terrified to leave as the remain lot have so far put the economic argument whereas most of our side make arguments of an abstract nature that most people do not engage with</p>

<p>Not sure the Remain side's economic arguments are particularly clear. I think their rationale is also abstract and always cast in the negative, clearly intended to incite fear of the calamities that will befall us if we leave, even though we were not inside the EU in its current guise until very recently. If you think Remain has convincing economic arguments to put forward, especially at a time when the EU is in economic turmoil with 50% youth unemployment in the South and a massive trade imbalance caused by the Germans using the euro and not the DM (this is all well reported by many economists), then I would be pleased for everyone to hear it.  Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>I agree with you that the Out campaign should be focusing on things that matter to ordinary people. Whilst passport queues and villas in Spain are one thing, I think the situation at home is the most important to people. That's what the Out campaign should focus on. Sadly the In campaign of fear will sway many people. E.g. 3 million jobs will be lost. Utter crap, but it fools people.</p>

<p>I agree, and immigration is my number one issue, but I've done my own polling amongst those that hate immigration and when I dig below the surface I find in the end it will be economics, their wallet and silly things like Customs queues that will win the day.<br/>Brits love a moan but few see it through</p>

<p>The EU would have us believe it is on the Long March towards a social democratic utopia, only the word democratic has lost its meaning and utopia is fast becoming a dystopia.</p>

<p>If Britain votes to remain in the EU we will have ceased to exist as an independent nation. Maybe that is a good thing, but I can't help feeling that in the great Balance Sheet of Britain's influence on the world that the Credit side hugely outweighs the Debit and that if Britain should cease to exist as a sovereign nation the world will be a poorer place. The question is not whether Britain will have greater influence inside the EU than outside, it is whether Britain still has a world role to play.</p>

<p>Maybe it doesn't any more but before we agree to be subsumed into a European superstate we need to reflect on the sacrifices that our forefathers made in order to achieve the most stable and free nation on the planet with a parliamentary and justice system that other countries would literally die for. Benefits to migrants, or a few points of GDP either way should not be deciding factors when we come to decide what country we will bequeath to our children. Self determination is what I inherited and I want to bequeath it.</p>

<p>Thing is - that word "democratic" : it doesn't seem to mean what everyone thinks it means.</p>

<p> If I may illustrate - the old East Germany, which called itself the "German Democratric Republic".... Was it democratic...?</p>

<p> In our own country we have the "Liberal Democratic"Party...Are they democratic...?  Some might say yes they are, but the addendum to that must be "only if you don't disagree with them"</p>

<p>How about further afield.  Isn't there a "democratic Republic of Congo" somewhere in Africa...?     Is it actually a democratic governing regime there as we would understand the word...?  I would be willing to bet that it isn't.</p>

<p>Do British people care how influential we are on a World scale? Isn't that for career politicians to care about? Surely our people are more concerned about their own lives, and how opportunity is scarce, immigration is rife and our culture is being destroyed as a consequence. Who gives a f**k whether we influence the foreign policy of North Korea when your own neighbourhood has changed beyond recognition?</p>

<p>In a nutshell.</p>

<p>Actually only 24% of the electorate voted for Cameron and the Conservative Party.</p>

<p>He got 37% of the 66% who bothered to vote.  When you factor in the 24% who didn't bother to vote, he had the support of less than a quarter of the electorate.</p>

<p>And in the Conservative Party (and presumably Conservative voters who aren't members) 70% want Brexit.</p>

<p>The BSE campaign ..... which is trying to pretend a vote for Remain is a given ..... is whistling to keep its spirits up.  Amongst the Elite (those who haven't borne the brunt of the EU policies or who get a direct personal benefit from membership) they may have a majority.  But out in the country, the little people have had enough.</p>

<p>UKIP got 8%. So?</p>

<p>And what percentage of cats prefer whiskas?</p>

<p>It would be fairer to have PR but of course, as it favours the two main parties, there's not enough political support.</p>

<p>The Conservatives had more votes than any other party. What is your point?</p>

<p>More people voted against them than voted for them.</p>

<p>But that's also true for all the other parties...</p>

<p>Rubbish. Nobody votes against a party in a general election. You can only vote for a party. To argue otherwise is specious.</p>

<p>People vote for all sorts of reasons.</p>

<p>The fact remains that the Tories got eleven million votes.</p>

<p>Labour, SNP, LibDems got a total of thirteen million votes.</p>

<p>Add the nearly four million votes for UKIP and there are seventeen million people who did not vote for the Conservative Party.</p>

<p>Your argument now will be to tell us that even though they voted against them they really wanted them to win.</p>

<p>No, my argument is simple: more people voted for the Conservatives than for any other party. That resulted in more seats for them than any other. If you want PR than agitate for it, just don't bleat after the fact. Nobody in UKIP said a word about the flaws in FPTP prior to the GE.</p>

<p>I'm just pointing out the facts ma'am.</p>

<p>The fact is that the conservatives got more votes than any other party. This is not rocket science. By all means argue for pr, but don't expect to win that argument either.</p>

<p>Voters will use their own eyes and ears to decide which way to vote. The chronic shortage of school places, hospital beds, long waiting lists for medical treatment, overcrowded transport and uncontrolled migration and asylum seekers will be the main deciding factor.</p>

<p>If we leave, the EU will NOT implode.</p>

<p>In fact, countries like EIRE will be overjoyed because of the inflow of investment and jobs from the UK.</p>

<p>UK leaving will be like leaving an awkward work-social gathering. No one wants to leave first, but everyone wants to leave. Once someone does, several will follow.</p>

<p>If we leave, the EU will NOT implode.....Of course easy to say this, trying to convince the populations, when the elite are dirt worried. These tricksters won't reform and never have the intention to do so.</p>

<p>That will be why Irish government sources have confirmed privately that if we leave, they will need to leave too</p>

<p>The Irish have always said they wanted to be free and independent. At present, as EU members, and even worse, in the Eurozone, they are under the full control of Brussels.</p>

<p>Don't be silly. Ireland is already expressing misgivings.</p>

<p>The two paid EU trolls on here should get a room.</p>

<p>Surely your assertion (if true) that the renegotiated package will be put on the shelf until the outcome of the UK referendum is known, should be enough itself to sway many voters to decide to Brexit.</p>

<p>After all, we have no guarantee whatsoever that it will ever be enacted. One only has to look back at all the binding and still undelivered assurances given to Tony Blair on CAP and CFP reform when he negotiated away our EU rebates ten years ago for evidence of how seriously the EU keeps it's promises.</p>

<p>'Surely your assertion (if true) that the renegotiated package will be put on the shelf until the outcome of the UK referendum is known, should be enough itself to sway many voters to decide to Brexit'.</p>

<p>No. Most punters are not political anoraks and will not have the faintest idea about 'renegotiated packages'.<br/>Total irrelevance to average joes. Thus it will have no influence on how they vote.</p>

<p>You can imagine David Cameron as leader of the Barons at Runnymede:</p>

<p>"Yes sir.  King sir.  I have these Barons who have this silly idea about freedom..."</p>

<p>Then there is David Cameron negotiating at Munich in 1938 with that nice Mr. Hitler:</p>

<p>Oh well, you get the idea.</p>

<p>You, and many others, fail to understand a simple fact.<br/>Cameron is attempting to re-negotiate treaties that were signed into European and British law by British Prime ministers and the British parliament.<br/>If you wish to lay blame, target the ****holes that got us into this position, not the man who is attempting to correct the errors of his predecessors.</p>

<p>There is one outstanding difference between Neville Chamberlain and David Cameron.</p>

<p>Chamberlain was trying to prevent a second major war in a generation whilst dealing with someone who was perfectly happy to lie to leaders of other countries.</p>

<p>Cameron wants to give this country away and will cheerfully lie to the voters to do so.</p>

<p>A VOTE FOR LEAVE WILL HAVE ONE TREMENDOUS CONSEQUENCE<br/>If we British can do the honourable thing and put UK freedom before any personal fears or interests then something very dramatic will happen.<br/>The EU will begin to implode and will take a nose dive within a few months.<br/>Denmark will probably join us and Eire will reluctantly have no choice but to join us.<br/>We are the biggest contributor to the EU coffers through our membership fee our open seas fishing losses and through our massive balance of trade deficit with the other EU countries particularly with Germany.<br/>If we refuse to play the whipping boy and request fair trade and no controls ( unlike Norway and Switzerland) then the budgets of all EU countries will be in crisis.<br/>We have a balance of payments surpus with the rest of the world and could survive a few months of hard ball negotiation unlike Sweden and Germany who are rapidly running out of cash.<br/>BREXIT will smash and destroy the marxist dominated EUSSR and we will liberate the native peoples of Europe from the coming nightmare.<br/>VOTING FOR BREXIT WILL BE THE DEATH KNELL OF THE EU</p>

<p>Yes all very well, but to Mondeo Man this is one of those abstract points that mean nothing to his wallet or how long the customs queue is. You could line up 100 people in a high street and not one would mention your point here.</p>

<p>If LEAVE don't start talking to average voters interests, its game over.</p>

<p>I reckon the Prof's right. People will vote in or out based on an opinion they have already formed, whether that's prejudice or reasoned argument. I don't think the political campaigning is going to make one jot of difference. I also think that the opinion polls will likely be wrong and underestimate the "out" vote. I reckon we're already on the way out of the EU. This opinion (and everyone has got one) is based on my perceptions of the mood of the people as viewed through media and social media....not any polling, of course and is as likely to be wrong as those polls.</p>

<p>But I'm not wrong am I?</p>

<p>An honest post Don. Much indeed is opinion.</p>

<p>My own view is that when push comes to shove many will vote to stay in because it represents the perceived status quo and safety.</p>

<p>Despite all the iniquities of the EU they don't have enough visible day to day impact on the vast majority of the electorate.</p>

<p>We also have not seen ANY campaigning from the Prime Minister and IN yet, Cameron will surely do what he did on AV, wait until the last minute then speak authoritatively.</p>

<p>I would be a little more careful with the polls too, we are talking about a simple binary choice without the complexities of the general election. The problem is the reporting of the polls, which invariably misses out the percentage of don't knows.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You are totally wrong I'm afraid to say Dan<br/>Brits never stand up for Britain in the way the French stand up for France.<br/>We're small minded and will vote to remain in as we don't like rocking the boat.</p>

<p>We've had 5 million immigrants in the last 15 years, a desperate lack of housing and still we pretty much don't care as long as X Factor is on the box and our team wins the odd match, all is well</p>

<p>French protectionism kills them!</p>

<p>Ordinary people will see that voting for the status quo, is NOT an option. Especially when actual facts are given to them. <br/>Like Cameron`s wooing of Turkey to join by 2025.</p>

<p>Who is there that is giving facts? No one, certainly not the crazed loonies of Ukip.</p>

<p>Farage made the same analogy on LBC this morning as the one which won him the debate with old Cleggy.   For me that ticks all the boxes and sounds completely sane.  I don't see how you can argue it any other way.</p>

<p>I gave up listening to that liar long ago.</p>

<p>you sound like a complete idiot. No offence.</p>

<p>Yes dear but you are a kipper and therefore don't have to sound like it to be it.</p>

<p>But many will ignore the facts. Too many see it as a vote for either CHANGE or STATUS QUO. And they fear change. The fact that both options mean change is beyond them.</p>

<p>Is it.</p>

<p>I think you are, Don. They shy vote - big factor, here.</p>

<p>"Most people have already decided" And that includes the President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz "if Brits want to leave, let them leave"</p>

<p>Fortunately he doesn't have a vote.</p>

<p>Unfortunately he doesn't have a vote.....</p>

<p>Remain will win, here's why(I'm an out voter);</p>

<p>+ People are parochial and emotional, they will worry the Passport queue will take longer</p>

<p>+ They will worry they wont be able to live in Spain one day</p>

<p>+ They have been frightened into believing jobs will be lost, incomes reduced</p>

<p>+ They have been persuaded we are somehow 'safer together'</p>

<p>Reason I keep pointing this out is I want us all to conquer these and other arguments that are RELEVANT TO THE AVERAGAE NON POLITICAL ANORAK BRIT</p>

<p>I agree. Ultimately, people will vote with their wallets. They are unlikely to risk the unknown, lest it hits them in the pocket.</p>

<p>Remaining in is unknown too. <br/>The EU will be a very different animal in only 10 years</p>

<p>People won't see it that way - that is what matters.</p>

<p>I doubt it will exist in 10 years if we leave.</p>

<p>A typical poor performance was in evidence last night, Paul Nuttal. I love the bloke but he like so many in the Leave camp, keeps not making the critical points to explain how YOU will prosper in an independent Britain</p>

<p>Instead he takes the time to make more or less meaningless points about Camerons past promises - most people don't care about such abstractions, they just in the end want to know about their wallet and the Passport / Customs queue and can they keep their French villa.</p>

<p>Is it really so difficult to understand the connection between freedom and prosperity?</p>

<p>You have put your finger right on it. The case <i>must</i> must be made for us being better off out. If it is not, people will vote for the status quo.</p>

<p>There's that phrase again - status quo. The thing I'd like the leave campaign to highlight is, we won't be voting on the status quo. The EU is already bound by its desire to expand. Will the electorate accept the prospect of Turkey joining the EU? I highly doubt it! What then, push for another referendum?</p>

<p>All fine and good ac, but these are conjectures.</p>

<p>People surely won't vote on them.</p>

<p>Everything about both campaigns is conjecture! That's the problem!</p>

<p>Many Tory MP's still afraid to speak in support of Brexit and many of the 'big hitters,' I suspect, will come down on the side of their careers. MP's have also been warned that to support Brexit will disqualify them from future honours. When a place in the House of Lords is worth £75,000 a year, tax free, what price one's principles eh?</p>

<p>Another of those fringe non points. They will get in the House Of Lords regardless.<br/>Many are just convinced by the remain argument, it's that simple. The sooner we start focusing on the real arguments to leave, the better.</p>

<p>Then why the need to issue threats if the arguments to stay are convincing? The real argument is for freedom and democracy or the surrender of our country to the long planned, undemocractic European Federacy. They know Boris Johnson could be very influential and harm their cause so let's sweeten him, and others like him, with security for life. If you think that is an unimportant fringe point them you are somewhat naive. The dirty tricks can influence the outcome.</p>

<p>Quite so.</p>

<p>Does anyone know whether Farage and UKIP intend to vote for or against Cameron's package in the European Parliament? I cannot seem to get an answer on this.</p>

<p>He'll probably vote against, then claim it was an accident and he really meant for.</p>

<p>He won't turn up and blame it on the traffic, when he is actually just too drunk to attend.</p>

<p>The EP will not be voting on this</p>

<p>They will - I gave you the link.</p>

<p>UKIP probably don't know themselves.</p>

<p>Farage is in a really difficult position, here. If he votes against, then he is voting against reform (it is not nothing - child benefit, for example).</p>

<p>But if he votes for, then is it endorsing Cameron's package.</p>

<p>As I said yesterday, the EP will nto be voting on this</p>

<p>Yes, they will. I gave you the link.</p>

<p>Well, well, what a difficult position they find themselves in.</p>

<p>I've been saying for ages that Farage's strategy was flawed. He rubbished Cameron's aims right from the get-go.</p>

<p>Now, he has to back them.</p>

<p>He doesn't really 'do' strategy, does he.</p>

<p>Never has.</p>

<p>We woz robbed - FPTP. South Thanet - ballot papers "went missing". Oldham - "voter fraud".</p>

<p>Do you think that is where Trump got the idea for spitting out his dummy?</p>

<p>He probably told Trump he was 'cheated' out of winning Iowa.</p>

<p>Well now all of a sudden the press/DT have woken up to knowledge that quite apart from the figure twisting and poll reading, a vast majority of people in the UK do not want to be  part of the Euro Mafia anymore!!!!<br/>We should start looking at a period of wealth creation on the back of an exit and then go back with a new set of terms on OUR CONDITIONS, but hopefully without Dipstick Dave's spanners involved.</p>

<p>i dont know where you get this vast majority from. the polls are showing that the country is more or less equally divided.</p>

<p>Well now, half marks for half reading my comment. If you read it fully the "quite apart from figure twisting and poll reading" should come leaping out at your myopic eyeball. Try again but harder please!!!</p>

<p>when it comes to the crunch i suspect that most people will stick with what they are used to rather than a leap into the unknown.</p>

<p>I suspect you're right, but such people don't know what the future of the EU is to be.</p>

<p>Sadly that would be the worse situation and hopefully not the final one.</p>

<p>There is so much BS floating around at the moment. I hope the campaign proper with rectify that, at least to some extent.</p>

<p>This whole business of ever closer union, for example.</p>

<p>That has nothing to do with subsidiarity - in fact, the Lisbon Treaty specifically states the opposite.</p>

<p>Cameron only put ever closer union in his negotiation to placate his own backbenchers - the author is right.</p>

<p>i know many people who are waiting to see what sort of deal cameron gets.<br/>if for instance he gets an opt out from ever closer union that will be very significant and could well swing it for staying in. even if the deal is not that good a lot of people will no doubt be persuaded by camerons slick PR machine.</p>

<p>We already know he got nothing of any value or any certainty of implementation.  Just what is it going to take before the British people get properly angry about this betrayal?</p>

<p>Before the people can get angry they'll have to pay attention. Now, back to the football or dancing and singing - or something. I'm not interested in politics.</p>

<p>Sad but true I'm afraid.</p>

<p>UKIP is now pulling out of Leave EU and siding with GO.</p>

<p>Good grief.</p>

<p>Leave.EU has aligned itself with GO.  UKIP is not "pulling out of Leave.EU"  we were never IN Leave.EU.</p>

<p>Farage has repeatedly said he will work with anyone to get the UK out of the EU and GO (Grassroots Out) is a cross-party campaign he helped get off the ground.</p>

<p><i>"Farage has repeatedly said"</i></p>

<p>That as we know means nothing. Farage also repeatedly said he was <i>"a man of my word"</i>.</p>

<p>Ukip really do need to get rid of this never-was/has-been.</p>

<p>No, Leave EU and GO are entirely separate, competing campaigns. So says Diane James.</p>

<p>He is just jumping ship to a forum where he can dominate. Normal behaviour for a jumped-up corporal.</p>

<p>Nigel's antics are unimportant.<br/>This is a decision for each and every British voter on the issues. Not personalities.</p>

<p>If personality was not critical, then you would find the popularity of a leader has no baring on General Elections, yet UK EVERY GE was won by the most popular political leader</p>

<p>People aren't logical, they're emotional. They vote for people they like on X Factor / Strictly, not whos the best singer / dancer per see</p>

<p>You can see this in action in any public gathering such as a party - you get some prat who's every word is hung onto, not because he has great things to say, merely because of his 'charisma' and non verbal cues</p>

<p>The choice at a GE is between two almost identical political wonks and makes little difference.<br/>.<br/>This is a real issue.</p>

<p>Not just Nigel - UKIP.</p>

<p>Will Aaron be taking his piggy bank with him?</p>

<p>He's staying with Leave EU, I think. I suspect there has been another falling-out.</p>

<p>Nige was probably still pished from last night.</p>

<p>The issue is simple.<br/>Anyone who has expressed an opinion has stated that the EU requires reform.<br/>Cameron's deal does not create reform, nor will it lead to it. There is no further prospect of reform beyond this discussion. <br/>The UK should therefore leave.</p>

<p>But it's not simple, it never is.<br/>We have to win ordinary people round that think about things like 'will this mean I have a longer queue at Passports control' and 'will this affect my income' and 'will this mean Spain will send me packing, I own a villa there'?<br/>To you an I notions like reform are central, but to the average Brit 'reform' is some vague abstraction, I assure you of this.</p>

<p>The stupid non-elite voting eh? Whatever next.</p>

<p>you miss his point wilfully I think</p>

<p>Well, Professor Patronizer, people who can't write cogent English might do better to write nothing. What a badly conceived, condescending article.</p>

<p>And by the way, what on Earth is a "Commissioning Fund Awardee"? Are we supposed to be impressed? Huh.</p>

<p>Is it not typical, that those who do not live in the real world, (in this case the land of Acedemia), should make the assumption that people will only vote according to their prejudices?<br/>Why prejudices and not reasonable opinions.<br/>I will be voting to leave.<br/>I will do so because I have seen treaty after treaty, ad infinitum, that have been detrimental to Britain's interests and the interests of the British people.</p>

<p>That is not prejudice, that is a reasoned conclusion.</p>

<p>I suggest that if the good Professor wishes to find prejudice, he should look in the mirror.</p>

<p>The 'in' campaigner's strategy includes branding those who want to leave as, 'uneducated.' or nor graduates.  We will hear this often over the coming weeks along with, 'we are safer in,' when the mass movement of people, without let or hinderance, suggests otherwise.</p>

<p>I'd quite like to leave, and I'm a graduate.</p>

<p>Me too - I'm a doctor of philosophy even, and I live in France.<br/>I'm 100% OUT, so there!</p>

<p>I thought that living abroad disqualified you from voting?</p>

<p>It does, and quite right too!  I am however naturally interested in what happens in my home land, and also very hopeful that Britain can show my adopted country the way to go.</p>

<p>"David Cameron's EU deal will not change any minds. Most people have already decided."</p>

<p>Only partially correct.  Those of us who have never had any belief in Cameron's re-negotiation and had long ago decided that the only course was to leave will certainly still be of that view.</p>

<p>However several posters on here in recent days have said that they had been willing to vote to stay in if he achieved something worthwhile and had been waiting to see what he would produce.  Now, they were very disappointed and would vote to leave.</p>

<p>Those like them are probably why a Times poll published today has shown a big switch to the Out vote since the deal was announced - and that's before the other EU countries all try to dilute it, since it's reported that none of them support it.</p>

<p>An awful lot of people fom MPs, the CBI and many others fell in behind Cameron's ploy of " a new deal fro the UK in a reformed EU".</p>

<p>However, Cameron's  deal' produces nothing of the sort and as it stands may well not get past the 'colleagues' in Brussels with out still more watering down.</p>

<p>So where now for those who support UK membership of a 'reformed EU'?</p>

<p>To the Out camp hopefully Sid.</p>

<p>And more will vote to leave when the OUT campaign get their act<br/>together.</p>

<p>Schulz is helping.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12142260/If-the-Brits-want-to-leave-let-them-leave-say-EU-leaders.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...</a></p>

<p>An 'in' vote will be the biggest suicide note ever written by the British people. European cultural disharmony and the gradual assimilation of Islamic peoples, is already having profound effects on European culture and social harmony. This will become increasingly detrimental to our way of life. The politicians have, long ago, lost visceral connections with the voters. They are out of control, immune to the voices of the people they purport to represent.</p>

<p>Europe is no longer about an economic principle as the 'in' campaigners would have us believe. The purpose is to destroy nation state democracy and identity and reclassify citizens as, 'Europeans.' Voters need to think seriously about the type of Britain they want to impose on their grandchildren.</p>

<p>Absolutely!  People need to understand "the EU is not a Trade Bloc - it's a Power Cult"</p>

<p><i>"The EU is not about trade, it is not about cooperation and it wouldn't <br/>recognise multilateralism in a billion years. Everything it does is with<br/> the intent of affording itself more power and more control while <br/>passing the responsibility and the consequences on to member states to <br/>deal with. It is here where nuisance turns to malevolence and such an <br/>affront to democracy, based on a foundation of intellectual sand, should<br/> be resisted.</i></p>

<p><i>If we examine EU for what it really is, it's a power cult - and one that<br/> will never stop until it holds all of the power. It confiscates our <br/>wealth then acts like some kind of benevolent Father Christmas, buying <br/>off all the institutions such as academia, NGOs and local authorities <br/>who would otherwise oppose it, so that when it comes to a popular vote <br/>the establishment will never turn on its paymaster."</i></p>

<p><a href="http://peterjnorth.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/the-eu-is-not-trade-bloc-its.html" rel="nofollow">http://peterjnorth.blogspot.co...</a></p>

<p>I Like that... BIS - Britain In is Suicide.</p>

<p>"It leaves Brussels institutions with virtually the same powers as before."<br/>-----------<br/>Yes, we know.</p>

<p>But that isn't what Call Me Dave promised he would deliver.  He said he would negotiate a Treaty change; reform the UK's terms of membership and would put the new relationship to the British people in a Referendum.</p>

<p>There IS no Treaty change.  There is no new relationship.</p>

<p>All he and the EU are proposing are a few minor changes to existing polices.  They will achieve nothing the British people wanted addressed:  open borders and mass, uncontrolled immigration being the main complaint for most;  Sovereignty and the lack of democratic accountability for others.  And the proposals are not trustworthy or bankable.   Post referendum, the EU Parliament can vote them down or the ECJ can say they are unlawful ..... and we will be stuck.</p>

<p>Cameron has shown himself up to be a useless negotiator;  a liar and a deceitful CON-man with this deal.  His attempt to bully and threaten Tory MPs with wrecked career prospects is disgraceful and his instruction that OUR representatives in Parliament should ignore their local Constituents wishes in favour of doing what he wants is an outrage in what is SUPPOSED to be a Representative Parliamentary Demcracy,</p>

<p>There is only ONE safe option and that's to LEAVE.  And if it gets rid of the Flashman in No.10 who is attempting to scare people into surrendering their country's Sovereignty and Democracy, then so much the better.</p>

<p>WE DESERVE BETTER.</p>

<p>Us out-voters have lost this.</p>

<p>We don't have a big hitting leader making the out case, and most commenters on boards like this one and callers into radio phone-ins, are not making calm logical pro-independence arguments, but instead are using very lame old pub bore type narratives that wont swing a single undecided voter.</p>

<p>Lines such as 'we must get out from under Merkels skirt' or 'the EU is a gravy train for failed Westminster MPs' or 'Cameron is a puppet of Brussels'. This is just the kind of fuming red faced slightly unhinged stuff that doesn't win arguments.</p>

<p>I agree. The kipper mentality is spoiling the field.</p>

<p>Says the frequent dispenser of mindless abuse</p>

<p>Any abuse which I dispense is cogent, aperçu and targeted. Yours is just the sprayings of a troll.</p>

<p>Funny, it looks mindless and repetative</p>

<p>That is because you have no finesse. Oh, and your spelling needs an overhaul as well.</p>

<p>you are a racist</p>

<p>You are clearly stupid.</p>

<p>Hmm! how do you come to that conclusion?</p>

<p>Most people are probably not up to speed on the economic case for Brexit. But they usually understand what's at stake in social and cultural terms. If that understanding gives them reason to vote Out, there's no grounds for complaint. </p>

<p>"who will vote mostly on their long-held prejudice"</p>

<p>How to denigrate and insult your readers.</p>

<p>If I wasn't confused before reading this, I am now.</p>

<p>His writing is as clear as mud. And him a Professor and all!</p>

<p>Let me save you from the confusion.</p>

<p>Vote Leave!</p>

<p>Amazing debate winner that....</p>

<p>Why didn't I think of that.</p>

<p>Voting to leave the EU will be like shovelling the s*** out of the Augean Stables, meaning Cameron, Osborne, &amp; Co will go as they will have lost the war, resulting in that, we, may just, get a new leadership who puts the the indigenous peoples of the UK before immigrants (&amp; so called refugees) and illegals.</p>

<p>We would regain control and run our country as we see fit, close our borders, stop handing out billions to foreign governments in aid, repeal the EHR Act, deport illegals and foreign criminals, and foreigners convicted of a crime in the UK. Also deport those granted UK citizenship or right to stay rescinded if they are convicted of committing a crime in the UK. Rabble rousers, extremists, and others who are here as guests to be educated but campaign for the UK to change in order to accommodate their views (eg, ongoing nonsense to remove Cecil Rhodes statue, demands for Sharia Law), should also be turfed out.</p>

<p>All deportees go and that's it. No more appeals over many years at taxpayers expense. If they don't like it, let them fund their appeals themselves from whichever Third World latrine they were deported to, but not here at our expense. Do I care if Lybia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, etc, are unsafe? No I don't. If they commit a crime or come in illegally they really have no grounds for remaining.</p>

<p>In short, we can put GREAT back in front of BRITAIN where it belongs!</p>

<p>So why not vote to leave the EU? You know it makes sense.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>They're a bunch of lickspittles, prepared to give up their country for the sake of their jobs.</p>

<p>Who is William Haig?</p>

<p>somebody who was shown photos of him in bed with a man and who has been blackmailed ever since</p>

<p>Allegedly like William Hague then? Personally I think the story is nonsense.</p>

<p>Don't be vague...</p>

<p>A child Tory star, now a fading grandee slaphead.</p>

<p>A bit like William Hague then?</p>

<p>I can see what you did there, you are wasted hereabouts.</p>

<p>I was a bit wasted last night. Too much Springbank.</p>

<p>Dame Sally whatsherface will slap your wrist for imbibing so.</p>

<p>If she does I'll slap her right back. I hear she likes a Friday evening at the Dog and Duck.</p>

<p>She does rather have the countenance of a woman for whom your threats are not without common acceptance.</p>

<p>Woof Woof</p>

<p>Just wait and see how many more choreographed 'stay' decisions will come from Tory MPs in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>They will still be outnumbered by articles that show that Cameron's negotiating position is in full reverse. Not to mention the shooting-themselves-in-the-foot diktats emerging from the EU that make the case for Leave stronger day by day, or any new antics that Merkel's guests are getting up to, especially with the Women's Carnival Day in Cologne, coming up soon:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.carnifest.com/events/germany/koeln/531/cologne-women-carnival-day-weiberfastnacht-2016.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnifest.com/event...</a></p>

<p>-assuming the German authorities don't ban it for being 'provocative'.</p>

<p>But at grave risk of losing their seats at the next election.</p>

<p>The electorate have short memories!</p>

<p>Conservative / Ukip  traditionalists will not forget nor will they forgive. If Remain wins expect significant  Ukip gains at the GE. That said I honestly think Leave will win because Remain has only lies and scaremongering and the sensible voter will see right through them. Those that don't care or don't understand won't vote.</p>

<p>Mate you could not be more wrong, Remain will win the day.<br/>I'm to the right of Le-Pen and vehemently want out, but we've lost it.</p>

<p>No one on our side is making the winning arguments. No one is calmly explaining how independent states such as Australia and S Korea are thriving. No one is explaining how lots of business is relocating to Turkey and exporting into the EU thus demonstrating the idea 'outsiders' cannot easily trade with the EU is nonsense.</p>

<p>No one is explaining how the EU has 53 trade deals and that of course we will be 54.</p>

<p>No one arguing how it is Japan and Australia perfectly represent themselves at the true rule setting global bodies, so far from losing world stage influence, we gain it by independence.</p>

<p>Instead people make non arguments about Brussels gravy trains and Merkels big stick etc, which whilst true, are of almost no relevance to most ordinary Brits.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favour pal and grow a pair will you.<br/>This referendum will be decided on individual gut instinct not handwringing indecision. The Leave vote will be rock solid and will get 100% of it's vote out. Immigration will be the biggest driver of that gut instinct and will cause a lot of people women especially to be shy about what they say to pollsters. Leave will consequently be materially  under polling and are already way ahead on 56% of decided voters in the latest poll. A majority of undecideds will be "shy leavers" as in "shy tories." "Events" like Cologne on NYE could also play a big part and can only hurt Remain. Leave will win. Lot of work to do first though.</p>

<p>Who will they not forgive? Those who vote to remain?</p>

<p>Woof Woof</p>

<p>I note Oliver Letwin is in the remain camp, I view him as the useless kid who was always last when choosing sides for football, if you were unlucky, you were forced to include him in your team.</p>

<p>And then he gets blamed for every goal conceded!</p>

<p>It does, at least, give him some purpose.</p>

<p>If Brexit wins surely Cameron would have to resign,</p>

<p>No, he would say that 'Out' was the best thing for Britain and pretend it was his idea all along.</p>

<p>As I keep repeating here, he is after all a politician.</p>

<p>I doubt he will resign, more like he will be kicked out when instead of initiating the exit process he enters more talks with the EU with a view to a second referendum just like in Ireland.</p>

<p>The way that the odds are stacking up with the bookmakers, he would do well to seriously consider campaigning for the "out" crowd.</p>

<p>In a world where politicians had a sense of honour and principles that extended beyond their own self-interest maybe.  Meanwhile ......</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Britishinfluence, the Remain campaign, have used that as a reason to remain.</p>

<p>There's absolutely no reason I can see why that would happen. </p>

<p>Woof Woof</p>

<p>There is no excuse for 'fence sitting'. This is a matter of fundamental principle, which these MPs have had plenty of time to consider.<br/>They are showing that they are only considering their places on the greasy pole. I suppose it's asking too much for them to just be honest (naive of me, I know), but this issue is just too big for petty manoeuvring.</p>
