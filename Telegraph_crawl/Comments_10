<p>Jacob Rees-Mogg writes: "This is why the renegotiation is so inadequate: it does not change any of the EU's powers. In the many lists drawn up by Conservatives over the years there were demands that would have had real effect. The UK's fishing waters were to be returned, free movement was to be changed fundamentally, social and employment law was to be repatriated, the justice and home affairs opt ins were to be returned to inter-governmental arrangements."<br/>Exactly and well-summarised. Why have these all been lost along the way? Why haven't Conservative MPs faced the Prime Minister on these specific issues? If they have done we don't seem to hear why he rejects the call for these subjects to be elements in the renegotiation issues.<br/>Withdrawal from the Common Fisheries Policy is an obvious step yet not mentioned by David Cameron at all. Instead we have Richard Benyon MP, the former Agriculture Minister in Defra 2010-12, former Eurosceptic, and the one Minister who understood the CFP, putting his name to a call from some Conservative MPs to support the draft agreement that the Prime Minister has made with the European Union. Not impressive.</p>

<p>To those of us who were around at the time ,it was an idea to make trade easier and cut red tape not create a federal state ,also having  survived a world war remembered Churchill's words jaw jaw not war war ,so it is no surprise how its has turned out ,and does  not a need a man who seems to have swallowed a dictionary to point this out</p>

<p>Although the conservatism of the electorate ('apathy' probably describes it better) would indicate that it will vote for the status quo, as evidenced by the rejection of change in the last couple of referenda, I am beginning to think it might play in favour of Leave. The Out campaign needs to focus on the inexorable march to integration and the drip, drip, drip of individual cases where decisions contrary to our national interest have been taken by EU institutions. The status quo is not on offer. If we wish to keep our country we need to stop ever closer union and Cameron's bit of paper will not do so. Every veto and success he has declared over his term in office has been overturned, and the EU courts and institutions will carry on doing so. When the electorate realises that Leave is the only emergency brake we have the referendum could have a surprising result.</p>

<p>Cameron is behaving as he is because the Conservative Party big guns, the ones we never see or hear about, are aimed at his head.  These people, the same people who brought down Margaret Thatcher, have their own reasons for wanting to stay in the EU (for the most part, 'follow the money') We will rarely know who they are, but, generally, we refer to them as 'the establishment'. We should not assume that an Out vote will lead to us leaving the EU.  These people are not known for their willingness to bend with the democratic will.  They will fight tooth and nail to defy it if they feel it goes against their interests.  </p>

<p>If the EU is a monster it is an emasculated monster as the Ukraine and Syria demonstrate. The real world action is in Cuba, where Pope Francis is about to meet with Archbishop Kirill, an enormous step in healing a 1000 year schism in Christendom and potentially a huge boost to Russian confidence in Syria. Just in time since Riyadh and Ankara are about to invade with their Sunni caliphate armies. I see the Pope is also getting friendly with Shia Iran. The battle lines are being drawn.</p>

<p>Labour Leave Retweeted YouGov Poll</p>

<p>Labour voters are gradually starting to turn against the EU.'<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/labourleave?lang=en" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/labourleav...</a></p>

<p>It has only taken 100 years.   I cannot see why anyone unemployed or on low pay would consider Labour their friend or remain to be their interest.</p>

<p>well, it's good to have different groups with the same aim of leaving the EU.</p>

<p>The only surprise to me is that the Tories are more divided than Labour, immigration is hammering the low paid and unemployed while driving up the cost of housing even in areas of high unemployment.  The government are farming out immigrants to places like Middlesbrough, of course the ones who are not doctors or engineers.</p>

<p>But I thought the tories had taken over the mantle of being the "worker's party" (without a squeak from the labour party).<br/>Or have I misunderstood?</p>

<p>If we vote remain who on earth would be stupid enough to join the army. Our soldiers will be fighting EU battles and being locked up by the ECHR when they get back.</p>

<p>Please, my sides are splitting.</p>

<p>from 7:30pm <br/><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/02/05/livestream-grassroots-out-public-meeting-farage-pursglove-brady-and-special-guests/" rel="nofollow">http://www.breitbart.com/londo...</a></p>

<p>Thanks for confirming that he is indeed a clown.</p>

<p>How polite of you.</p>

<p>water off a duck's back, child.</p>

<p>How comforting for you.</p>

<p>I am bemused that anybody believes that voting "OUT" means that we will leave the EU. If the “OUT” vote wins there will total panic in the EU corridors of power with them running round like headless chickens to offer us what Cameron should have asked for in the first place to stop us from leaving.</p>

<p>The IN/OUT nature of the referendum is a ploy by Cameron to allow the IN-group to use fear of the unknown to frighten voters into voting to say.  He tried the same tactic with Scottish Independence referendum to avoid having to offer devo-max, but that blew up in his face when the polls suggested an “OUT” vote and he ended up giving Salmond everything he wanted in a state of sheer panic.</p>

<p>The question we will be answering in the referendum is not a simple one of “IN” or “OUT” as Cameron and his IN-supporters would have us believe, it actually a choice between voting “IN” and accepting the pitiful offering that the EU grandees have put in Cameron’s begging bowl, or voting “OUT” to send the message that unless they stop taking us for fools and come up with a sensible offer we will leave and bring their whole sorry edifice down on their heads.</p>

<p>Once that is recognised, it draws the teeth of the “IN” camp and an ”OUT” vote becomes a win/win situation.</p>

<p>I am surprised that the Scottish referendum NO campaign is not studied more closely.  It seems to be being ignored.  Yet the tactics pursued then are now being rerun for Brexit.  It surely helped that Saatchi were on the NO payroll, and may well be employed again as the Government will spend freely of taxpayers money to push the "EU is good for you" message.  The OUT campaigners have to rely on the widow's mites from private individuals.  Expect big business to push for remaining IN along with a generous supply of supportive IN comments from empty-headed celebs.<br/>Some three days before the date of the vote the Government/IN campaign will make a big positive announcement designed to both scare voters and reinforce the message.</p>

<p>I have said many times a leave vote is the only logical one even if you want to remain, Merkel has made it clear that he thinks all problems can be solved with money</p>

<p>Just like Bulgaria got a better deal from the Soviets after they tried to leave the Warsaw Pact.</p>

<p>Seriously?</p>

<p>The "IN/OUT nature of the referendum" is now being viewed as a "ploy"?</p>

<p>only by him.</p>

<p>I wrote to the PM office in December; below is a reply received today from the govt Referendum Unit; .........just for your info.</p>

<p>"</p>

<p>Thank you for your e-mail of 2 December 2015 to the Prime Minister about the European Union.  As you can appreciate, the Prime Minister receives a high volume of correspondence.  Where relevant, letters are delegated to officials at the appropriate government department for a response. Therefore your letter has been forwarded here to the Europe Directorate as the department leading on this issue.</p>

<p>On your two questions regarding Sovereignty, the Government wants to increase the democratic accountability of the EU, including through strengthening the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making.   We need a new arrangement where groups of national parliaments, acting together, can stop unwanted legislative proposals.  We want to see the EU’s commitments to the concept of “subsidiarity” fully implemented, so that decisions are taken as close to citizens as possible.  Finally, we want to make clear that the commitment to work towards ‘ever Parliamentary sovereignty and the UK constitution</p>

<p>People often refer to the UK having an 'unwritten constitution' but that's not strictly true. It may not exist in a single text, like in the USA or Germany, but large parts of it are written down, much of it in the laws passed in Parliament - known as statute law.</p>

<p>Therefore, the UK constitution is often described as 'partly written and wholly uncodified'. (Uncodified means that the UK does not have a single, written constitution.)</p>

<p>Developments affecting Parliamentary sovereignty</p>

<p>Over the years, Parliament has passed laws that limit the application of parliamentary sovereignty. These laws reflect political developments both within and outside the UK.</p>

<p>They include:</p>

<p>The devolution of power to bodies like the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly.<br/>The Human Rights Act 1998.<br/>The UK's entry to the European Union in 1973.<br/>The decision to establish a UK Supreme Court in 2009, which ends the House of Lords function as the UK's final court of appeal.<br/>These developments do not fundamentally undermine the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, since, in theory at least, Parliament could repeal any of the laws implementing these changes.closer union’ does not apply to Britain.   For further information about Sovereignty: <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/sovereignty/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parliament.uk/about...</a>.</p>

<p>(</p>

<p>On your third question, the position is that Parliament is sovereign.  In exercise of that sovereignty Parliament enacted the European Communities Act 1972 (“the 1972 Act”).  The 1972 Act provided for the United Kingdom’s accession to the European Union. The subsequent European Union treaties to which your constituent refers were all ratified by the United Kingdom with the necessary related enactments being passed by Parliament. The 1689 Bill of Rights (an Act of the Parliament of England) did not preclude or prevent Parliament from enacting either the 1972 Act or any of the subsequent amendments to it. Consequently, British membership of the EU is fully compliant with Britain’s constitutional and legal order. Further information can be found at: <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/parliament-and-europe/collections/parliament-and-europe/european-act-1972/" rel="nofollow">www.parliament.uk/about/living...</a>.</p>

<p>Referendum Unit, Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office</p>

<p>You asked whether the Bill of Rights made the European Union Act unconstitutional?</p>

<p>What an idiot!  I bet that gave them a right giggle.</p>

<p>As I said, I did NOT ask any question regarding the Bill of Rights. You made a value judgement and missed the point. But that is because you are not the sharpest knife in the box.</p>

<p>No, their response was plucked from thin air.  Pull the other one Bazza.</p>

<p>The context was related to "your constituent" but that goes over  your head.........as it would being so thick.</p>

<p>In response to your letter.</p>

<p>EU should 'undermine national homogeneity' says UN migration chief</p>

<p>ha! oh dear such a child.  You do not come anywhere near the definition But why not show some acumen and actually deal with the topic.  I posted the reply on the basis that some might be interested in what the Europe Directorate are currently saying on the matter. Now, end of discussion. thanks.</p>

<p>So amusing. Many would beg to differ, but you are of course entitled to your odd little views.</p>

<p>I see your v iews are as popular as ever; almost 15000 comments and you ve scratched just ove 5000 upvotes...says it all...Busted pal. and you can go on and on being obtuse but it means sfa to me.</p>

<p>.here tack this "r" on to "over" for me.</p>

<p>None odder than you Climbdown. You are noted for your strange personal ways on these pages. Off you go.</p>

<p>Think I will stay around for a while, thanks. </p>

<p>Ha ahhaahaaha hahahah OH HAHAAHHAAA <br/>you are a real card.</p>

<p>Hey buddy, I'm white and I used to have a Chinese girlfriend.</p>

<p>Is this a problem for you?</p>

<p>I expect it was for her.</p>

<p>LOL</p>

<p>Aw Bazza, is that the kind of language to come from a former employee of DG101 or whatever you claim it was.</p>

<p>DG23 and as I said your view on my statement is of no interest to me whatever. You could not aspire to more than working (if you are off benefits yet?) in anything more exacting than a burger bar.</p>

<p>I'll just have a little check..</p>

<p>You seem quite cross. Why is that?</p>

<p>He asked me a question then smirked having made a value judgement and not having observed the facts. I did NOT ASK ABOUT THE BILL OF RIGHTS. GOT IT?</p>

<p>As i said, you seem quite cross (hence, I suppose, the childish use of upper case). Are you always like this?</p>

<p>Bazza takes himself very seriously.  It's just a shame no-one else does.</p>

<p>Probably because people laughed at his letter.</p>

<p>I doubt that you could even compose anything of any merit having crawled out of you bog standard comp. school.</p>

<p>(today's KipperRant is sponsored by the word "bog"?</p>

<p>"your". Your education is showing.</p>

<p>Such a stupid retort. It is obvious to anyone but a chimp like you that I forgot to hit the "r" key</p>

<p>bad typing is not uncommon on here. and the big point that you and smoked boy fail to note is the cop out regarding Sovereignty ..........preferring to stab me with your pitchforks. hahaahah</p>

<p>I agree. Most people on here (that includes you, little one) are catastrophically stupid.</p>

<p>None so stupid and thick as you  an oik to all who have any degree of common sense. Not to worry, I imagine it cannot be easy for you.</p>

<p>Did you use up all the capital letters in other posts?</p>

<p>In my old job we used to get a couple of letters like this every week, they'd get passed round and we'd all have a good laugh.</p>

<p>Job? What in the local betting shop?</p>

<p>Have you been sending letters asking about British sovereignty to bettering shops again?  No wonder it took you so long to get a response.</p>

<p>Actually No I didn't .if you notice there was reference to "your constituent" so stop having a perverted orgasm and think...THINK instead of  jumping to conclusions..........you idiot</p>

<p>They stitched us right up. They didn't even read the Lisbon treaty. Even the then Europe Minister, Caroline Flint, admitted that she hadn't read it. They were told it was 'just a tidying-up exercise'</p>

<p>"They didn't even read the Lisbon treaty"... you honestly believe that?</p>

<p>If this is the kind of "logic" the OUT campaign is built upon, support for it will dwindle steadily.</p>

<p>If you want to reach out to reasonably intelligent people who are on the fence, you're going to have to do a lot better than this.</p>

<p>Brooon did not read the Lisbon treaty either, he just signed it,<br/>what a berk!</p>

<p>Is this really representative of the kind of factoids you people share with each other?</p>

<p>It's true. <br/><a href="http://www.theeuroprobe.org/2013-013-how-the-lisbon-treaty-was-voted-through/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theeuroprobe.org/20...</a></p>

<p>'The un-amended Treaty of Lisbon, of some 294 pages, was deposited in the Commons on Dec 17th 2007. Most of the MPs had gone home for Christmas by then as parliament recessed the next day. How many knew it was there let alone read it? For the disastrous consequences for British democracy and sovereignty see 2014 – 028 The facts about the Lisbon Treaty</p>

<p>Parliament returned on Jan 7th 2008. One of their first votes was to ratify the Lisbon Treaty previously signed by Gordon Brown.<br/>Although the government had the amended Treaty (by now 328 pages) for some time it was not deposited in the Commons Reading Room until 11.45am on the morning that MPs had to vote to ratify it (21 Jan 2008).  Again how many knew the amended Treaty was there and would it have mattered. It was quite impossible for an MP to read 328 pages – with numerous sections having then been transferred to, and scattered among, numerous other Treaties and documents – and get an understanding of what it was all about before the vote.'</p>

<p>What a relief that is. All my fears of the UK being subsumed by Europe were just me being silly!</p>

<p>All those in favour of Brexit (and I'm one) need to tell as many people as possible that the true referendum question is "Do you want the UK to become part of a European super-state"? That is what a YES means.</p>

<p>When UK citizens know the true nature of what they're being asked to vote on then I think we'll see a lot more joining the OUT side. We need to keep banging that point home.</p>

<p>Did I mention that the Grassroots Out meeting is live from 7pm on Breitbart London?</p>

<p>Thanks Nige.  Hope you get there this time!</p>

<p>We should never underestimate the power of the printed page to lie and deceive - The drivelgraph has gone into overtime on it .</p>

<p>BBC midland news were giving out some good EU propaganda tonight,<br/>Iron Bridge might have fallen down without the money that EU gave it,<br/>they forgot to mention where the money came from in the first place,<br/>THE UK.</p>

<p>I would not be surprised if they claimed its construction was financed by the EU.</p>

<p>Let us be fair to all the Eastern european countries, in fact to all the poor EU countries (apart from Greece who have been shafted). The EU is good for them, what is not to like, new roads, sewage systems - EU loans up the ying yang.</p>

<p>We need to be concerned whether it is good for the UK as the 5th largest economy and a net contributor it is not a good deal we are getting. Not by a long chalk.</p>

<p>Once the Euro countries start to become one country - they will have to for the Euro to survive, we will be a total spectator with no influence at all. So why pay them billions per year for that? Norway complains that they have no influence on shaping the rules, well not only would they have join the EU - they would also have to join the Euro to have any influence whatsover.</p>

<p>All a bit much - considering you only want to trade with EU countries.</p>

<p>When did we assume we are in control of our own Sovereignty these days.</p>

<p>When we stop doing stuff that defies all logic.</p>

<p>The German's and French have even started to merge their armed forces</p>

<p>Rather like in WWII - they joined forces to round up the Jews, and others they considered  'undesirables'.</p>

<p>That does not mean they trust each other, before the second WW, the Germans trained with the Russians and look what happened.</p>

<p>It means the EU Defence force is coming via the back door.</p>

<p>It will never work!</p>

<p>And we won't be part of it.</p>

<p>And this time, we won't be bailing them out.</p>

<p>Saves the French the trouble of surrendering, I suppose.</p>

<p>That will bring some confusion regarding forwards and reverse.</p>

<p>It is always handy to have some tanks that go backwards</p>

<p>Dan says the outers have all been led up the garden path by lies , deceit , smoke and mirrors and disinformation .  Surely our politicians wouldn't do that to us . Would they .</p>

<p>When the Prime minister of the UK has to ask permission of the EU to Change who comes here. You know just how little authority he actually has.</p>

<p>He has none.  The 27 can vote to put all immigrants here, as Merkel suspended the Dublin accord they can just make a new accord.</p>

<p>So, it is your house, your home,bought and paid for, everyone of the family knows the rules.</p>

<p>You invite a guest - who is eventually found to be a terrorist and you have a family meeting to discuss what to do.</p>

<p>Kick her out is the unanimous response.</p>

<p>So you tell her that she has to leave - IMMEDIATELY.</p>

<p>She refuses and is supported by some committee somewhere in Europe - who tell you - she must be allowed to stay in your house - because she might get hurt if you kick her out.</p>

<p>When did we become the FUNNY FARM?</p>

<p>Couldn't we send her to America to be close to her daddy.</p>

<p>They couldn't complain about that could they?</p>

<p>Have a hunch she 'might' not get a VISA.;)</p>

<p>Just after we joined the EU</p>

<p>Ex flippin sactly.</p>

<p>1997</p>

<p>You sure it was not decades earlier?</p>

<p>David Cameron is keen to allow Turkey in the EU. This would then allow 75 million Muslims to come to the UK if they wanted to. Who is going to vote to stay in the EU?</p>

<p>'Who is going to vote to stay in the EU?'</p>

<p>Given the apathy and indifference of so many combined with the connivance of some, the nightmare might prove real.</p>

<p>It would also open up Turkey to 500,000 Torygraph readers.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Say something about the diluting of white people Adrian. It's not the same when you don't.</p>

<p>Yep and that would allow 70 odd million Brits to go there if we wanted to. Do you see how silly your statement is?</p>

<p>But I don't want to live in a Muslim country. I want to live in a secular democracy. The only trouble is so do millions of Muslims escaping the religious nuts who are killing each other.</p>

<p>But you won't live in a Muslim country.</p>

<p>I thought Turkey was a Muslim country</p>

<p>Indeed. I thought you meant that the UK would become a Muslim country....</p>

<p>The UK would only become a Muslim country over the dead bodies of 60 million people. We have been fighting to escape from religious tyranny ever since the Pope arrested Galileo in 1633. We = those who have escaped from the clutches of priestcraft. England is almost free. We have just got to separate the Anglo-Catholic Church from the state and get rid of the bishops in the House of Lords</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>WTF wants to go there? You go.</p>

<p>No thanks. Why on earth do you think that the entire population of Turkey would want to come here?</p>

<p>Then why even bother mentioning it?</p>

<p>I just said that they would be free to come here. To get in all they would have to do is just show their passports at our border. I did not say the whole population of Turkey would come here.</p>

<p>Accession talks between EU/Turkey are stalled with very little progress on the 33 chapters of conditions that must be met before Turkey can even apply to join,<br/>Cyprus are opposed to Turkey's entry, so even if the 33 chapters are agreed, Turkey must have the unanimous agreement of all EU members to join.<br/>So trying to demonise Cameron on this subject it totally useless and your talents would be better employed in finding another reason to attack Cameron as this one just shows up your lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>I am not demonising Cameron. Just stating a fact. He would vote to allow Turkey to join the EU. We can only hope that Cyprus holds out.</p>

<p>Sorry but you totally missed the point, Cameron will be long gone as will most of us, long before Turkey are anywhere near to qualifying.</p>

<p>Let's hope you are right.</p>

<p>Those that want to leave - do not need scaremongering, it is scary enough in reality.!!!</p>

<p>Only 75?  I bet the Turkish authorities would be more than lax about who they issue passports to under their current regime.  Islamification of Europe is more important to some than the peace and prosperity the liars in the EU promise.</p>

<p>Yes, the same as Cuba after the revolution. They emptied the prisons and sent their criminals to the USA. Any EU state could play the same game. It would be the way in for IS supporters. We would sink into an abyss of a new Dark Age. After Winston Churchill.</p>

<p>European union is more then just Europe, it's about creating a Global government. the hole world can come to britain</p>

<p>No borders = no benefits and certainly no NHS.  <br/>Remind all the lefties that unfettered immigration cannot be supported by low wages and a small tax take to support those who cannot support themselves.  <br/>Low disposable income does nothing for any economy in the long run.</p>

<p>And Turkey allows ISIS barbarians free reign over its borders.</p>

<p>So much for Cameron's sovereignty that he allegedly battled so hard for! The ECJ will not allow the UK to deport the criminal daughter-in-law of Abu Hamza. We have no authority over our own internal matters. Is that what the people of this country really want?</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Ah, Adrian. We missed you.</p>

<p>Where is adrian nowadays?</p>

<p>I am totally sick and tired of reading these pathetic articles in the DT. Our morale will not be shaken, and these pusillanimous weedy words are suitable only for the dustbin. </p>

<p>Go and "read" Breitbart then.</p>

<p>Monkey says the deal is "irreversible".  Organ Grinder says it isn't.</p>

<p>That's actually amusing.</p>

<p>And accurate.</p>

<p>Jacob is quite right. Without treaty changes or new treaties enshrining national independence in EU law, nothing will change its direction. Cameron's 'renegotiation' is nothing of the sort. It is simply a dish of platitudes. EU heads of state or Donald Tusk can say what they like to placate Cameron, it is what is in the treaties that matter.</p>

<p>Independence is a dirty word in their brave new world.  Everyone and everything must be dependent to some degree on the edicts of the EU.<br/>Power must be held by the few over the many, if order is to be obtained and maintained.</p>

<p>Treaty changes can be reversed in the next treaty change.  What would we be able to do about it?</p>

<p>The only way is Out.</p>

<p><b>..................SO THAT WILL BE A BIG FAT 'NO' THEN!..............................</b></p>

<p>Those in favour of staying in the EU love to throw the '3.2 million jobs will be lost' myth about.</p>

<p>And yet not one of them is willing to at least try to debate it.</p>

<p>Pah! What is to be done?</p>

<p>I heard the other day that 5.5 million EU jobs depend on trade with us, so once again, they need us more than we need them.</p>

<p>I am afraid I am going to have to offer the same argument - trade is between businesses - not states - trade will continue whether we are in our out.</p>

<p>The results,consequences, benefit of that trade has nothing to do with the EU.  Trade between buyers and sellers will exist long after the EU has finally decayed.</p>

<p>In the preamble to the treaty of Rome 1957 part of it states - Determined to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe.<br/>Peoples of Europe.  Anglo Saxons, Slavs, Gallic or Germanic.  Not peoples from the Levant, or Africa, North or South, not Asian, or Turks but the peoples of Europe.</p>

<p>There again the preamble is merely a statement of ambition which like the ambition to provide peace and prosperity can be judged only by the liars whose jobs and massive salaries depend on the project continuing and not the people, as our input is of no consequence whatsoever, even our good will is not necessary.</p>

<p>“Nothing Britain does can stop the EU monster from swallowing all in its path.”</p>

<p>The EU will stop swallowing all in its path when its madness in regards immigration and asylum seekers comes back and bites it in the butt. Millions upon millions being allowed in; the vast majority of whom have absolutely no intention of integrating or adapting European values. Rather, they intend making Europeans adapt to their idea of culture and religion.</p>

<p>When the European natives finally wake up to the damage that insane Leftist policies are doing to the continent there will be massive unrest. Merkel in Germany is sensing the people’s wrath and has done a u-turn that’s completely out of kilter with her earlier having invited untold numbers of Asians and Africans to Europe.</p>

<p>The EU natives are similar to that very good-natured man who allowed a down on his luck stranger to share his home. After a while he realises that the stranger is dominating his house and introducing his own set of rules. It will take the good-natured man a while to realise that no-good thugs do actually exist, and that he’s allowed one into his home. But by then the trespasser will have come to believe the home to be his own and it will take force to remove him.</p>

<p>Europe, asylum seekers and immigrants are heading the same way. The difference is that the European natives won’t be able to call the police and get the thugs arrested and thrown out, instead, they’ll have to stock up with implements and throw the ne’er-do-wells out themselves. The best thing we can hope for is that they won’t be wearing jackboots and swastikas while doing so.</p>

<p>Determined to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, <br/>Peoples of Europe, not everywhere else.</p>

<p>Merkel has suggested the referendum needs tweaking &amp; the electorate should include the right for any refugee that wanted to come to the UK to vote to remain....job done said Merk's as she dismantled the handbrake without the permission of anyone never mind 55% of members.</p>

<p>I would not be surprised if postal votes were issued in the middle east and Africa.</p>

<p>You would be wrong.</p>

<p>Being surprised is not an issue of right and wrong is it.</p>

<p>The idea of postal votes being issued in the ME and Africa is though.</p>

<p>Postage paid ?</p>

<p>Yes but there will just be one big container.</p>

<p>The takeover and destruction of Britain has been a long time in the planning.</p>

<p>Some would argue since 1933 or perhaps 1914 or perhaps in 1945 once the dust of another German stab at world domination was beginning to settle.</p>

<p>Edward Heath was apparently involved from the very beginning. It was very clever and very quietly done. As he said once if they told the British public what the ultimate plan was nobody would vote for it. So they had to do it a bit at a time so we got used to each bit at a time.</p>

<p><a href="http://aanirfan.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/heath-named-in-child-abuse-probe.html" rel="nofollow">http://aanirfan.blogspot.co.uk...</a></p>

<p>Of course! A conspiracy! Why didn't anyone realise? get a grip ffs.</p>

<p>There are rumours he did many things quietly</p>

<p>Mr Rees-Mogg as an MP you are in the best position to ask the front bench why they support an unaccountable,completely undemocratic and totally corrupt EU. We look forward to your first ackward question in the HoC</p>

<p>They love it. Unaccountability, who wouldn't like that?</p>

<p>Shame we can't comment on DH's column, it would be nice to ask him how credible the rumours are that Corbyn is about to announce his resignation from the leadership claiming intrusions into his private life are intolerable. </p>

<p>Dan usually loves getting loads of comments as well.</p>

<p>The editor decides who has comments enabled, not the columnist.</p>

<p>The trolls were already working on too many fronts to cope with Hodges blog as well, so they left the comments off.</p>

<p>You don't actually read the hysterical schoolgirl's column, do you?</p>

<p>Never have and never will.</p>

<p>Surely they could pay more of them or are they saving the funds for closer to the referendum?</p>

<p>Well I suppose it is POETS day.</p>

<p>Will postal vote rigging be outlawed or made compulsory during the referendum?</p>

<p>The ballot boxes are already stuffed.</p>

<p>MI5 have the monopoly on this, so it won't be made compulsory for all, no...</p>

<p>They certainly did a great job for Dave in Scotland.</p>

<p>Top UK judge says Govt's EU deal won't be legally binding or deliver 'irreversible' change <a href="http://j.mp/1S5qRYl" rel="nofollow">http://j.mp/1S5qRYl</a> <a href="http://pic.twitter.com/63TCKgqvTm" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/63TCKgqvTm</a></p>

<p>And another top judge says that Dave is just pissing in the wind trying to get the HoC declare itself supreme. We signed the unconditional surrender document in 1972, and nothing has changed since.</p>

<p>WE all know that - it is the EU trolls who deny it.</p>

<p>Good point thank you</p>

<p>Obviously, the treaty hasnt changed.</p>

<p>why did cameron stand in the house of commons yesterday and told all he had a legally binding deal</p>

<p>Because he lies for a living.</p>

<p>Because it is true until such time as it isnt true (after June)</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>The govt say that they are rejecting the UN ruling in respect of Julian Assange and they will arrest him if he leaves the embassy.</p>

<p>So why can't they defy the ECHR rulings when they put the safety of British citizens ar risk or become a liability on the State ?</p>

<p>Good question. No money in it for them.</p>

<p>death penalty for High Treason and for aiding and abetting international terrorism</p>

<p>I cant remember any sensible verdict from those idiots, todays ruling from the UN on Assange was even dafter.</p>

<p>Assange is on your side. There's a reason the EU wants to get him.</p>

<p>I dont care, the whole story is BS.</p>

<p>It is, as is the millions spent on guarding the bloody embassy. No attempt to get Swedish prosecutors to interview him as is standard. Enemy of the state.... he did not rape anyone - the woman doesn't think he raped her either.</p>

<p>I dont care.</p>

<p>You opened the discussion - so perhaps that was unwise. It is another example of wicked double standards in our corrupt Establishment.</p>

<p>I dont care about assange I do care that anyone claiming immunity for any reason can then claim to be unjustly imprisoned, it is ridiculous whether Assange is good or bad right or wrong.</p>

<p>Sorry - I agree with you almost without exception, but here you are wrong. This is a fit-up, and you must ask yourself why.</p>

<p>That is because you thought I was making an issue about Assange he just happened to be the person involved.</p>

<p>Don't bring him up then! :)</p>

<p>I brought up the ruling which could be applied to anybody whether you are for or against it is stupid.</p>

<p>Actually being against what the Swede's have done is in all of our interests. If they can fit up a well-known individual, they can fit up anybody. The dangers of the European Arrest Warrant for British citizens are writ large by this case.</p>

<p>I fear nothing from Assange, and don't believe those women. It is amazing that that the moronic Hogan-Howe can find the money for that operation, in no-one's interest, but none to stop the traducing of a gallant soldier, or bother to investigate the rampant, endemic corruption in his own force - unless of course, like the Kinnocks, he went native and joined in with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The woman he is supposedly accused of raping through "sex by surprise" because he didn't wear a condom doesn't want to pursue it and never claimed she was raped. the swedish, pro-women, state decided she shouldn't be able to decide what happened to her own body.</p>

<p>It appears they are very fond of rape in Sweden, and only pursue white rapists.</p>

<p>Well the other lady in question did write a piece, proudly published on the net, on how to fit up an unfaithful lover for rape. I kid you not.</p>

<p>I have no interest in him at all either way but to say someone claiming diplomatic immunity is being in some way imprisoned is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Well, if I was under house arrest, with Plod waiting to me arrest me if I stepped outside I would consider it prison.</p>

<p>That is NOT a good expenditure of taxpayers money by the corrupt Met.</p>

<p>If you want to talk about waste of tax payers money we could discuss Blair's protection squad.</p>

<p>I would pay twice as much to remove it.</p>

<p>Google has no links to assassins.  It not the squad I want removed, it's their principle.<br/>I know, I know, hatred is bad for you, but when it comes to Blair I just can't help thinking bad thoughts.</p>

<p>It is the law, it is only diplomatic immunity that creates the situation, in any other house the police would go in and get him.</p>

<p>Even if it's for a crime that doesn't exist in the UK?  <br/>Should we hand over all the political dissidents who have the protection of British asylum? <br/>Go back a bit in time, what was he exposing? <br/>Jail the whistle blowers not the offenders.  It reminds me of schools that used to exclude the victim and not the bully.</p>

<p>Pity the Met aren't so diligent with our imported criminals, or any of the Mr Big's who they have taken money from.</p>

<p>It has all been said before:<br/>'Nothing can stop the Nazi war machine'. The Belgians were only too keen for Britain to capitulate.<br/>Nothing changes.</p>

<p>To be honest I don't think the UK will leave the EU. It could happen and I want it to happen, but then you've got most Labour voters who will vote to stay in, and pretty much anyone of a socialist bent. There are millions of them. The majority of immigrants (with a right to vote), the lefty Scots and Nationalist Northern Irish, On top of that you've got a whole tranche of people with second homes and vested interests in remaining in Europe. It will not be easy to win a vote for OUT. That said events can happen that could swing this, and I believe there could be an easy win for OUT. Much of that will depend on what happens in Europe this year. Another million plus migrants turning up might focus minds, as would further terrorist strikes. Once the British people realise that dark and out of control forces are heading this way they will want out in their droves. Let's hope they make that choice before those dark forces and events happen, and which I believe will happen.</p>

<p>And even today you'll find that there are people in the unions and other 'left wing' organisations who are also campaigning to get out.</p>

<p>I dont know how labour retain their vote, immigration affects the low paid more than any other.</p>

<p>They import more who have a vested interest in voting for labour.</p>

<p>And then there is the bent postal vote system which they have got off to  a tee.</p>

<p>A lot of vote rigging, especially in muslim areas.</p>

<p>They don't know how to vote any other way.</p>

<p>Well, Dave has done his deal, and 5 out of 9 cats who expressed a preference are now saying that their owners would prefer to Leave, even though the official campaign for such is a total dogs dinner still. What's not to like?</p>

<p>The cats are of course worried that the closure of borders might prevent them from a 2nd &amp; 3rd lunch at various houses in the vicinity while dogs demand the right to defecate anywhere they please.......sounds much like the EU Commission</p>

<p>SELF FIRST, PARTY SECOND....COUNTRY UNPLACED.,</p>

<p>Given his preference for pigs I would suggest he sees us as a giant piggy bank that he can tip up whenever he's short of cash and empty whatever he can for himself and his mates.</p>

<p>Doesn't Cameron realise that EU law became supreme in the UK in 1972, and any act that we subsequently passed regarding this was merely to adjust our own body of law to conform with such? We cannot "undo" this situation by passing wind in our own HoC, only a war of independence will do it! So, vote LEAVE!!</p>

<p>Vote or war?</p>

<p>True, though sometimes we have to look elsewhere than the DT to find reference to relevant matters.</p>

<p>At last - someone in the Tory party willing to state the truth of what will happen with the EU.</p>

<p>Eu superstate is going to happen - it is as certain as the fact the sun will rise tomorrow - and the UK will be part of it as will Greece.</p>

<p>So we have to keep Abu Hamzas daughter in this country against our will..... European courts rule over us again.Vote Out for freedom,</p>

<p>Perhaps the ECtHR will pay for her keep? Ah, thought not.</p>

<p>Ah, what enrichment.</p>

<p>Dave should just stand up to Heseltine , Clarke and Major and tell them he is going to leave .   Wait ... Two pigs have just flown past my window .</p>

<p>That should get him excited.</p>

<p>LibLabCon are a political cancer eating the heart out of democracy in Britain. Who knew that "Britons never, never shall be slaves" would turn out to be foolish optimism.</p>

<p>Who do we thank?  Blair, Cameron, and the legion of traitors posting on here for their 30 pieces of silver from the utterly corrupt monolith the EUSSR, whose very construction so astonished Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>

<p>Mr Shultz has announced the people of the UK can leave the EU...however they must also leave the UK as the UK now belongs to the people of the EU,,,,er, hang on a mo!</p>

<p>13:5 million refugees ears pricked...I love it 'when a plan comes together' said Merkel</p>

<p>Merkel and her cohorts are now sprawled all over Europe.</p>

<p>The dark grip of our would be oppressors lies just across the channel. we must resolutely and methodically prepare ourselves for the campaigns that lie ahead, long and arduous as they may be.</p>

<p>Two or three months is not a long time, even in our short, lives. There is nothing in the history of the nation, and when we are doing the finest thing in the world, and have the honour to be the sole champion of the liberties of all Europe, we must not grudge these years or weary as we toil and struggle through them.</p>

<p>It does not follow that our energies in future years will be exclusively confined to defending ourselves and freedom of our nation state. Many opportunities may lie open to us as an ambitious power, and we must be ready to take advantage of them. One of the ways to bring this conflict to a speedy end is to convince the EU, by both our words, and our deeds, that we have both the will and the means, not only to go on indefinitely, but to strike heavy and unexpected blows against those that would seek to enslave us under the EU yoke for an eternity.</p>

<p>The road to victory may not be so long as we expect. But we have no right to count upon this. Be it long or short, rough or smooth, we mean to reach our journey's end and free once more the island bastion of the free world.</p>

<p>When the day of reckoning comes, and each man or woman must do their duty and vote LEAVE or else account to the highest power.</p>

<p>When the OUT campaign fails by a small margin....<br/>The EUSSR will consider it business as usual<br/>Expect even more migrants/invaders foisted on the UK<br/>Expect more demands for contributions to €uro corruption and chaos<br/>Expect more knife crime in the UK and more school disturbances a la Crewe gippos</p>

<p>And expect the implosion of UKIP<br/>And finally expect the Rise of The English National Movement<br/>Gloves off marching boots on call to action<br/>ENOCH WAS RIGHT</p>

<p>Highly likely that as "Good europeans" we will have to join the eurozone.Cameron says we wont but what ever he  says he does the opposite.</p>

<p>Merkel opens Europes doors and suspends the Dublin agreement on a whim while the UK needs 55% EU  support to decide how to pay child benefit.  The system is madness. Lets get out of it.</p>

<p>Yes did the EU allow her to do that?</p>

<p>As soon as she spoke the whole EU tried to figure out how to satisfy her demands.</p>

<p>They make it up as they go along. They can do what they want but will stop anyone else trying to do the same.</p>

<p>Hence we are forbidden from deporting that hamza bloke's criminal daughter.</p>

<p>Dear Jacob Rees-Mogg,</p>

<p>Thank you for your article.<br/>There is something we Brits can do, that will turn defeat into victory : -</p>

<p>Let Us return to 'THE DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGS' GOVERNMENT  !!!<br/>As GOD chose HMQEII to be Our Monarch; we can invite Our CHRIST incarnate Queen to form HM'S OWN UNITY GOVERNMENT, and we will see THE SALVATION of Our GOD  !!!</p>

<p>GOD SAVE OUR WORTHY TO RULE ABSOLUTELY, FAITHFUL, UNITING, CHRIST INCARNATE, GOD QUEEN.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br/>Veteran09.</p>

<p>She really is a good old stick. But doubt if she will take the Divine Right of Kings that far. Look what happened to Charles 1</p>

<p>Dear deedee2,</p>

<p>Thank you for your comment.</p>

<p>Christ chose to make HIS Second Coming 1,926 years after HIS death and resurrection - in 1953 at HMQEII's Coronation Ceremony  !!!<br/>What a Co-incidence; HMQEII was born in 1926  !!!</p>

<p>In 2022 we Brits will have been governed by politicians for 333 years; a third of a Millennium, and what a mess we are in; TIME FOR MONARCHS TO HAVE THE DIVINE RIGHT TO RULE US AGAIN IN THE NAME OF THE LORD.</p>

<p>GOD SAVE OUR WORTHY TO GOVERN US, CHRIST INCARNATE; GOD QUEEN.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br/>Veteran09.</p>

<p>You really need to get that caps lock problem on your keyboard fixed.</p>

<p>The Old Testament shows that it is alright to use large type so that it may be read whilst running  !!!</p>

<p>If it is O.K. with GOD it is OK for Us Brits.</p>

<p>GOD SAVE OUR WORTHY TO TAKE OVER GOVERNMENT, CHRIST INCARNATE; GOD QUEEN.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br/>Veteran09.</p>

<p>Just to inform you that no one reads posts full of caps.</p>

<p>Who among us thought when we voted to stay in the Common Market that one day it would have its very own Court which would prevent us from deporting a convicted criminal, the daughter in law of a convicted terrorist even though our elected government wishes to do so?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12142702/Moroccan-criminal-fighting-deportation-is-Abu-Hamzas-daughter-in-law-a-Tory-MP-reveals.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...</a></p>

<p>That is just one measure of how the simple trading partnership we voted for has changed beyond all recognition.</p>

<p>I bet Cameron knows this full well, too.</p>

<p>So Jacob what exactly do you intend to do, if every Tory MP who disagreed with Cameron's terms and were no longer prepared to support him were to announce they were resigning from the Tory Party and joining UKIP etc. then you might be taken seriously, but you won't, so forget it!</p>

<p>Rees-Mogg, along with those other privileged, antediluvian Tories who have spent years undermining leaders of their party to push their minority views, deserves never to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>EU moderators = lupo dio</p>

<p>I like the cartoon - pretty well spot on.  Out is the only way to go, especially since we have been told by the President of the EU Parliament that this "deal" is highly likely to be rejected by MEPs.  Cameron clearly has no idea how stupid he looks and how arrogant he is in ignoring or dismissing the voters' views as negligible.  I hope he or one of his minions is reading these columns and the comments, although I suspect he will just ignore them and bulldoze his way through regardless.</p>

<p>Rees-Mogg. Who was given the job of proof reading this?</p>

<p>"those who agreed the texts have long know this"  Very knowing of them.</p>

<p>"In his evidence to the Treasury Select Committee, he writes that “the phrase 'ever closer union' does not found any legal obligation" - is "found" here a legal word?</p>

<p>Kosher use of "to found", meaning to set up or establish.  I agree with you on the first point!</p>

<p>Lawyers will be lawyers.</p>

<p>Jacob are you singing our song?</p>

<p>Farage's alliance with Leave EU didn't last long!</p>

<p>He hasn't many friends left in the party now. Even big donor, Arron Banks, dumped him, saying he was toxic with the electorate.</p>

<p>I rather imagine that's why he has gone to Go. So to speak!</p>

<p>Can you blame him?</p>

<p> They're   not really  behind the concept of Leaving the Eu.</p>

<p>So we have:</p>

<p>Leave EU<br/>Vote Leave You<br/>Take Your Leave<br/>Leave it Out<br/>Outgoing<br/>Going Out</p>

<p>Out for the Count</p>

<p>I wonder who will get the funding.</p>

<p>The BBC</p>

<p>I suspect it will come together as FUEU.</p>

<p>Phew, surely.</p>

<p>Don't call him surely.</p>

<p>You all look the same to me.</p>

<p>Put that light out! Again.</p>

<p>Anyone got a live link for tonights out of EU GO meeting in Manchester UK ?</p>

<p>here we are...<br/><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/02/05/livestream-grassroots-out-public-meeting-farage-pursglove-brady-and-special-guests/" rel="nofollow">http://www.breitbart.com/londo...</a></p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>I'm sure Sir Konrad's knowledge is unparalleled and I'm sure he's an awfully nice man but none of his comment inspire any confidence.</p>

<p>The evidence of our sleepwalk to political union is there in the EU history. There are generally accepted to be 7 levels of union: Preferential trading area - Free trade area - Customs union - Common market  - Monetary and fiscal union - Political integration. We joined the EEC in 1973, a common market but since then we have progressed part way through the next step. The Euro represents monetary union and the EU, through the Greek crisis, is essentially exercising fiscal union. It's national budget oversight role in the Eurozone is another aspect of this.</p>

<p>When you add in the other trappings of statehood such as the EU's domestic law-making, its movement towards common or coordinated defence and foreign policy decision making then the last step is actually a small one. It will be a recognition of a European Federal State in name as the reality will already have been created.</p>

<p>The EU is a corrupt and dying organisation with a rapidly shrinking share of world GDP. It is centralist trajectory is at odds with today's successful economies such as China where the benefits of devolution has clearly been learned.</p>

<p>Nobody trusts politicians, especially EU politicians. Together with the EU lawyers, we can be confident than any agreements we may have negotiated will be overturned the moment we vote IN. The only thing to do is vote OUT.</p>

<p>Isn't it odd how the Leavers think we have the time and the inclination to read their view of history regarding the EU.</p>

<p>It gets trotted out like a mantra on a daily basis from people one suspects don't realise that the continuous repetition of the same material is a symptom of OCD.</p>

<p>What is the diagnosis for people who will not listen?</p>

<p>The point about the history is to make people understand the journey we are on, where it starts, and critically, where it ends. People seem to be focusing on subsidiary issues such as immigration while ignoring the key issue of sovereignty.</p>

<p>A quick glance at the old and recent history of the EU shows you all you need to know.</p>

<p>Rattle on about "sovereignty" (and "democracy") all you wish, dear chap - no one is stopping you.</p>

<p>However, there are 28 member countries in the EU currently, and they are all sovereign nations.</p>

<p>Not for long and already less than you think.</p>

<p>What kind of sovereignty is Greece enjoying at the moment? Their courts can be (and are) overruled by EU courts, their currency and exchange rates are controlled somewhere other than in Greece, most of their laws (like ours) are not made by them, they cannot make trade deals and finally, their budget is controlled by the EU. They cannot decide where to spend their money.</p>

<p>Ask yourself what is power left to the elected Greek government and how that compares to the freedoms of a truly sovereign government.</p>

<p>What sort of financial freedom does a person, or a company, have when either in liquidation or bankruptcy?</p>

<p>Greece got itself into a massive financial mess, and the creditors have a right to impose restrictions in order for them to provide the massive, massive, assistance to them.</p>

<p>You are backing the wrong horse trying to support a miscreant Greece, dear chap. They will have to take their bitter medicine for a long time.</p>

<p>"Galatians 6:7 - Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."</p>

<p>Surely this fellow realises we were taken in by deceit, so why hasn't he done anything about it?</p>

<p>At least Rees -Moggs contribution to earnest debate is rational and  logical</p>

<p> On the other side of the fence we have Dan Hodges increasingly desperate screams to draw attention to his wild ramblings-"Can we stop pretending Britain might quit EU?"  he shrieks. Its like having the resident nutter ensconced in the attic and escaping just when the Vicars  been invited to tea,</p>

<p>   Its a shame for the poor bloke, but hes a libbie leftie   at heart so quite understandable as hes impotently watching the imminent destruction of their collective new world order.</p>

<p>Hodges has a far better understanding of politics than Rees-Mogg and his ragbag band of disloyal Tories will ever have. One only has to look to David Davis to see how pointless it is to have such disloyal people as party members.</p>

<p>They seem to be indicating that they have the guts to avail themselves of the free vote open to all participants of which ever political shade.</p>

<p>Rees -Mogg &amp; his Father are the voice of sanity in a world of wanting &amp; demanding to transfuse us all with tainted blood!</p>

<p>Err his father is dead!!</p>

<p>He is like Thatcher, speaking from the grave.</p>

<p>There are apparently two ways to deal with the problem that Rees Mogg indicates: one is to hold a referendum, where the Outers win. The other is to get parliament to assert that EU law only has primacy over national law in the UK on the agreement of parliament. <br/>The referendum has no binding power, so the outcome provides government a context not a mandate.<br/>Parliament has the power to rewrite Section 2.1. of the 1972 Accession Act to the effect that the Crown in parliament is sovereign. It thereby ends the existing situation whereby the UK government gives unconditional recognition to the primacy of EU law.<br/>Taking this second path requires no fancy renegotiation.It just requires Cameron to use his parliamentary majority.</p>

<p>No, when the UK did this in 1972 it signed its unconditional surrender document. We cannot have supremacy again unless the EU returns such to us (unlikely) or we leave it (almost certain now). Dave is pissing into the wind here.</p>

<p>Thank you Mr Bush-Lawyer, but "No, thank you".</p>

<p>It would require a General Election to prevent the ensuing riots</p>

<p>It would certainly help but the majority of our MPs have already voted to say that EU law takes precedence - including Cameron and Osborne.  Therefore, they will have to leave if that happens.</p>

<p>Eastenders has a pro-EU storyline coming up in May.</p>

<p>Should just about swing it.</p>

<p>Good old Beeb, you can always rely on them to knock the plebs.</p>

<p>Hard to imagine where they could cast about to find one...</p>

<p>You could very well be more right than you know!</p>

<p>Will an immigrant camp be opening in the square.</p>

<p>If its a BBc Immigrant camp we can be sure they'll all be lovely people, Surgeons, Doctors Engineers to a man.</p>

<p> Not a  gimmegrant or sex offender amongst them</p>

<p>Something to pull more heart strings than that. A poor child who has lost a limb during the war and his blind refugee mother being brought over from Syria only to be put up in poor quality accommodation. </p>
