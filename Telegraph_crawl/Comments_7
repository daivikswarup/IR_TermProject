<p>Its Myanmar stop calling Burma. How many times do we have to tell you people.There is no Myanmese ok Myanmar is a country; Burmese and other ethics group live in it. ok learn about us  before you talk about us ok</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now you begin to grasp why<br/>Britain was so pointedly excluded from talks intended to return the Myanmar<br/>government to a more democratic path. As the former colonial power, Britain<br/>surely warranted a seat at the top table. But sadly HMG has the same dated mind-set as idiots like SE9.</p>

<p>There simply is no percentage in<br/>needlessly antagonizing the people you are negotiating with. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Japan is a former colonial power in Burma too, but the Japanese are also excluded.</p>

<p>You pathetic losers, you have no idea why we proudly call our country "Myanmar".  We are even more civilized enough to change our pronounciation from "Breet-ti-shia" to "Britain".  Only two out of over 200 countries in the world cannot recognize "Myanmar" as "Myanmar".  So much for the democratic principles.</p>

<p>"Pathetic losers"<br/> You hit the nail between the eyes. But that's Brits and their cultural imperialist governments for you. By trying to score some oh-so-last-season political point, they fail to realise how ridiculous they have made themselves. At some point HMG will be dragged into the 21st century as realpolitik reality imposes itself in the most embarrassing possible way. I’m already planning my<br/>gloat. The name of the country was changed to Myanmar in 1988. Try finding a "Union of Burma" embassy. Get with the programme, Luddites.<br/>So VIP treatment on the next visit, OK?</p>

<p>Only the word "The Gods".<br/>In Buddhism, there is no God.</p>

<p>At least when they squandered the nations wealth they actually built something with it, i guess they didn't have any incompetent banks to throw the money at!</p>

<p>I hope they never see that day either. I agree with your comments. </p>

<p>I was in Burma a few years ago by crossing over from Thailand. The strangest place, without a doubt on this planet. The people looked very sad, undoubtedly with good reason.</p>

<p>Not long enough to realise the country is Myanmar, not Burma.</p>

<p>Now tell me, as a Japanese, as you very well are, do some members of the Japanese themselves still refer to the Koreas and the Korean Peninsula as "Chosaen", and to Okinawa as "Ryukyu"?</p>

<p>Says who? The military dictatorship of Burma and the UN...the most corrupt NGO in human history? Ask any of the people in southeast Asia including the Burmese people and you will receive the same answer: BURMA. Obviously you have never visited the country. Smart ass.</p>

<p>Been into Myanmar three times to date, and planning to visit again in the not too distant future. <br/>That's Brits for you; always jump to a negative conclusion on literally zero evidence. May not be quite the nastiest people on Earth, but up there in the top ten.What were you saying about "smart ass"?</p>

<p>He is a Japanese in fact, who obviously does not really speak the English language properly. </p>

<p>Next, we will have him saying that because some know-nothing Americans, who cannot tell their elbows from their backsides, and no doubt of the fat and the not-very-intelligent variety, say so, we somehow have to follow suit! As if the Yank's Talk or the Yank's Speak count!</p>

<p>The United Nations does NOT even speak the English language! Most of that lot speak Chinese, Russian, Spanish/Castilian and Arabic! That lot used to speak French of course, and half of that lot still do, especially the ones left behind in Geneva, at Lausanne, Basel, in Berne and Zuerich.</p>

<p>The so-called "Secretary-General", a pathetic excuse of one at that, from Korea (South Korea), does not even speak English, let alone French! Yes, we should all be speaking OUR English language like him and that lot, sure!</p>

<p>There exists in the Church of England's two local Anglican churches of one's own two plagues from the Burma [Star] Association, notwithstanding the one, or ones, in the local War Memorial, and I cannot wait to see my Japanese friend taking them down and defacing them!</p>

<p><br/>Anyone that disagrees with him, he automatically accuses of not<br/>being British. Although his definition of being British is so narrow hardly<br/>anyone would qualify, including the majority of contributors to DT blog pages.<br/>Anything not found in his 1888 Oxford Dictionary is non-standard English, and<br/>thus the writer cannot be British. </p>

<p></p>

<p>I believe you have replied to my comment in error, as your comment makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You<br/>want to be careful associating with SE9, Rule. Insanity can be contagious. </p>

<p></p>

<p>I was trying to explain that how that man, "Jack t.S.B." (<a href="https://secure.disqus.com/profile/login/?next=https%3A//secure.disqus.com/dashboard/" rel="nofollow">https://secure.disqus.com/prof...</a> ), who is from Japan, and not from this Country or from Burma (Myanmar), is trying, in his one-man fascist campaign of linguistic fascism, since the years 2004 and 2005, to have the name "Burma" banned, and in fact he started off with the B.B.C., calling himself "Andrew Milner".</p>

<p>I am not surprised if he had sent poisoned letters and hate mail to the Burma [Star] Association, as part of his fascist campaign. </p>

<p>OK. I understand now. Thanks for clearing up my confusion. I maintain anyone, even innocently, who refers to Burma as Myanmar is implicitly accepting the claims of its military dictators. I have always for that reason refused to refer to it as Myanmar.</p>

<p>I, however, have a different view. Putting it simply, the name is just not English! The name is just simply unpronounceable in the English language! Not even Aung San Suu Kyi can change that fact!</p>

<p>It is not in fact Myanmar, as "My-an-mar", but "Maann-mar", in just two syllables, à la chinoise et à la viêtnamienne.</p>

<p>Some private American and Canadian organisations adopted that name as the sole name for that Country, but then most Americans , even the ones working in the C.I.A. back in the 1950s the 1960s, cannot even read an international map! As if they ever count! Like I said, what the fat Americans and North Americans say simply do not (usually) count.</p>

<p>If we must follow those fat Americans, by all means, if we are happy that our children might not be able to read a map, like the Americans, in the future.</p>

<p>We should not give in to linguistic fascism, even by democratically-elected and rerturned governments, administrations and authorities. Both the Indians and the Greeks have actually tried and attempted to change the names of their respective Countries in the English language as well, but I think that most in this World and most of the World just simply would not accept, or be prepared to accept, India (Hindustan) becoming "Bharat", or Greece becoming "Ellas", suddenly or otherwise. The Irish even chastises, deplores and reprimands us, the British, for continuing to use the Irish Gaelic name "Éire" to refer to the Twenty-Six Counties of the Republic in the South of the Island, instead of "the Republic of Ireland" or "Southern Ireland". </p>

<p>"I have always for that reason refused to refer to it as Myanmar."<br/>You just did. You're not a friend of Glenys Kinnock are you? She spouts the same Socialist rubbish.<br/>Flash to Realpolitik reality, Rule, and stop living in the past. The rest of the world's media use Myanmar, as do the UN and Amnesty International. <br/>But if you do manage to find a Union of Burma embassy, you will let me know won't you? In the meantime I'll just have to make do with a Union of Myanmar embassy for my visa.<br/>So no chance of running into you in downtown Yangon I assume. Shame, you're really fit it. Imperial measurement is still used in MYANMAR.</p>

<p>"Been into Myanmar three times to date, and planning to visit again in the not too distant future." and "So no chance of running into you in downtown Yangon I assume." made me cringe.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It would appear based upon the language and tenor of your combined comments that you and SE9 come from the same family.</p>

<p><br/>Rule, you need to grasp one<br/>obvious reality. I'm not Japanese. Although<br/>this has to be stating the obvious. </p>

<p>There is also a racist dimension.<br/>To maintain that unless you are British you are not eligible to contribute to a<br/>British newspaper, is racism of an extreme kind.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Looks to me, mate, like the two of you deserve each other. Leave me out of it. My only point was that to refer to Burma as Myanmar is to accept the military junta government's  determination on this or any other subject and to do that is cowardly and to implicitly acquiesce in their brutal totalitarian rule. The fact most world governments and the totally corrupt UN have done so makes it no less abominable.</p>

<p>As for your little feud with SE9, however, you two are welcome to slug it out without my further involvement. Go piss in somebody elses corner. Cheers.</p>

<p>What is it to you? You are from Japan, and you are a Japanese! You are not even from that Country yourself!  </p>

<p>There's a great description of Naypyitaw and the even wierder frontier lands between Naypytiaw, Mandalay and China in Thant Myint-U's new book "Where China Meets India:  Burma and the New Crossroads of Asia".  Napyitaw encompasses the old British logging town of Pyinmana, which is still there, and was used as a base for the Burma Independence Army of Aung San (Aung San Suu Kyi's father) in the days when he was allied with the Japanese against the Allies. </p>

<p>Most of the land for this Disney theme park complete with funny looking and acting clown is owned by villagers fin that area for decades if not centuries. They are simple told to get out and some people die at the time or afterwards with no where to go. </p>

<p>I hope the great NLD admired by the world will have time to remember the tortured souls that still haunt the place when they sit in along with their new best friend Thein Sein.</p>

<p>"Naypyidaw"</p>

<p>No former<br/>colonial name for you to use. Bummer! You know, in your place I'd back off on<br/>using "Burma". You know how sensitive the Generals can be on MSM<br/>Muppets using the former colonial name. They might even deport your ass back to<br/>Thailand. And what’s the percentage in that just to score some<br/>oh-so-last-season political point on behalf of HMG.</p>

<p>Still at least<br/>Myanmar is one of the three remaining countries to officially retain Imperial<br/>measure, so you must feel right at home. The others being Liberia and the<br/>United States of Torture. </p>

<p></p>

<p>"Members of the public accounts committee are reported <br/>  to be considering an offer of assistance from the Westminster Foundation, a <br/>  public body that assists parliaments in developing countries, to draw up <br/>  their own operational rules"</p>

<p>Now we see why they're so enthusiastic. They realised they can still take the people for saps and enrich themselves via the "operational rules"; and now they're going to learn from the masters themselves.</p>

<p>I wonder what the Burmese for Duck House is?</p>

<p>"Oven"</p>

<p>LOL</p>
