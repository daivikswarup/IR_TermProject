But surely somebody among those highly paid estimably expert opinion analysts could have seen that happening – and made a guess, on the grounds of basic human intuition, what the consequences would be. (Hey, guys, have you noticed how many of the targets over 65 aren’t taking our calls, or available on email?) If the age thing remains a factor in the EU referendum polling, then even the latest figures, which show the Brexit camp ahead, may be wildly underestimating its lead. </p><p> But it’s that point about intuition that is the insoluble problem. What has been pretty much ruled out entirely of modern, pseudo-scientific opinion-testing is precisely the indispensable ingredient for making sense of public opinion: some sort of grasp of the human condition. If, indeed, the polling employees who were actually doing the field work – making the phone calls, sending out the emails – had noticed the difficulty in contacting (or getting the active cooperation of) older voters, what could they have done with that perception? If they had reported it, they would have been told that no free-wheeling conjecture about what this might mean could be permitted. No doubt this prohibition on personal judgment would be regarded as essential to avoid “bias”: the collation of data must be free of prejudice or the kind of educated guesswork that makes social functioning possible in most spheres of life. </p><p>

To as great an extent as possible, polling technique should be as mechanistic and coldly neutral as if it were being done by a computer. Which, of course, means that it will miss most of the things that make human behaviour comprehensible, such as the desire for social acceptance, or irrational resentments – not to mention ambivalence and sheer perversity. </p><p> Contrary to what was believed until very recently, the computer model for political prediction is not the ultimate answer: it is the ultimate folly. Just when the peddlers of simplistic mathematical certainty become convinced that they have found the key to all political understanding, the people become more evasive, more mystifying, and more self-contradictory – almost as if they were determined not to be reduced to a calculable foregone conclusion. </p><p> This may be why it is so often the secondary questions that are more accurately revealing. Before the general election, when asked which leader, David Cameron or Ed Miliband, would make the best prime minister, a majority of people consistently gave the polls a reliable prediction of how they would actually vote. If, instead of Iowans being asked which candidate they were going to support, they had been asked which one they thought would be the best national leader in a global crisis, might there have been a different outcome? I suggest that the flat-footed question, who – or what, in the case of a referendum – do you support, is becoming futile. It is an invitation to cast yourself in an apparently closed-minded, no-exit definable way that is not acceptable in our fluid, mobile society which seems to offer so many possibilities for self-determination. </p><p> If this is true, then the real lesson of these mishaps is the one that should have been essential to any method of understanding politics: People Are Really Very Complicated. They are not like the experimental dogs that were taught to salivate when they heard a bell ring because they associated the sound with being fed. Tactical electoral planning relies on the assumption that voters have motives of their own – which they may or may not admit to – but it seems less able to understand that these voter-creatures have the capacity to understand, and react to, the motives of others. </p><p>

(I would surmise that they particularly dislike being taken for fools: EU referendum campaign please note.) The prospective voter is not just responding to stimuli (fear, greed, guilt, etc): he is imagining how his peers might regard his decision, what those who are seeking his support are thinking, and, most important, what his vote says about him as a person. </p><p> That last point is critical. Voting used to be largely hereditary: you supported the party that your family and your community had always supported. In Britain, this was a question of class loyalty. In the US, it was generally a matter of ethnicity and how recently your family had arrived in the country. It used to be a truism of American politics that the first generation born to immigrants were always Democrats. Later on, their children would move away from the sense of being disadvantaged outsiders and make their own political choices. I expect a similar sort of movement away from Labour will happen here as the children of immigrants become more integrated. </p><p> But the close communities with their continuity and their sense of belonging have not just broken down: they have come to be seen as depressing limitations on personal freedom. You are now expected to define yourself as an individual on every conceivable level. Each social act is a moral choice: what you do is what you are. So the current means of evaluating voter behaviour may not be ultra-modern at all. In truth, it may be hopelessly old-fashioned. </p></div>
