<comment>He is undoubtedly the best administrator and visionary among all Indian politicians though not as great a leader. But challenges are just too many this time.</comment>

<comment>He was administrator of Hyderabad largely and not Andhra.</comment>

<comment>That's not correct. He made sure that farmers/villages get guaranteed electricity for 7 hrs even in summer. Neatly laid out roads throughout the state(not just Hyd). Govt employees suddenly started working between 9-5. First state to implement e goverance. Janmabhoomi, dwakra, and other schemes were not for Hyd.Coming to Hyd, no doubt he did more but that's with a vision. Farming was no longer profitable, and he wanted small farmers to look for alternate source of income, and for that he wanted to increase jobs in private sector. For saying that, he was projected as anti farmer, everyone can see the state of farmers now. Farmers used to live a decent life comparatively couple of decades back. Now, daily laborers earn better than them and farmer suicide has become too common.He gave 24 hours electricity to Hyd even in summers. Before that it had 4-9 hours of power cut. It was a drastic and clearly palpable change within 1-2 yrs. He changed the landscape of Hyd and because of him so many MNCs setup facilities in Hyd.He lost election for two reasons:1. There were worst droughts in his tenure, and that resulted in many suicides. He was just unlucky. Probably he could have waived off their loans, but that trend had not started back then.2. He was simply too harsh on govt employees. That proved costly to him. Each employee can influence at least 10  votes, specially in villages.What he lacks is charisma and leadership skills. KCR and YSR are miles ahead of him in that regard.</comment>

<comment>Naidu was a disaster even in the first innings. Why else did people kick him out? The only saving grace was Hyderabad city. Even there he's a nobody now. He was able to manage the media and headlines brilliantly in 1990s. Let's see what he does now. </comment>

<comment>Bjp reneging on its promise as usual.jumla hai sab  jumla hair yeahChaddi bhajto bolo namo namo</comment>

<comment>Esaiah sekhar.... Your words are poison much like the kind that has been spreding across Andhra ever since Raajsekhar reddy became CM.</comment>

<comment>I will write 10 reasons why nobody should read mr saye shekaar. Millions of lies.</comment>

<comment>There is no limit to negativity of Mr Saye shekhar </comment>

<comment>Modiji as promised scrap reservation system. Even mohanji says only needy should be given reservation..</comment>

<comment>U r a Typical aap zombie -who have absolutely NO issues with out right lying</comment>

<comment>Naidu had some hits and some misses so far in his new innings. But to term this government as a disaster is extreme! He did not inherit a normal state. With no money, the scars of bifurcation still fresh, it is not going to be easy ride for anyone. The people have chosen the right candidate for these tough times. We should wait for more time before we pass on judgement.</comment>

<comment>Lokesh is RaGa of TDP...</comment>

<comment>These issues are nothing new. They have been dogging Nanidu since his stint as CM in truncated AP.Kapu agitation , is a manufactured one by the existant and the non-existant opposition in the state. Naidu is a shrewed negitiator and the kapus are no match for his guiles. The only irritant he seems to face is the constant hurdles to his smooth administration . Nothing new from the author.Only known and pedestrian stuff !</comment>

<comment>People of SA are left with no options.. Naidu could win in previous elections only coz voters had no other alternative.. YSRCP is openly corrupt and no way people could have voted Congress after bifurcation.. Instead of focusing on a  newly formed state he prefers getting boot-kicked by Telangana ppl repeatedly.. TDP hit a new low with Cash-for-vote scam.. No wonder they are decimated in GHMC election.. He's selling Singapore dream repeating the same mistake he did with Hyderabad.. Whatever happened to his DoD promise! Rayalaseema people have voted for YSRCP in elections.. CBN's neglect towards the region only proving their point that he's not trustworthy..</comment>

<comment>You mean that the state should have given a chance to Jagan Reddy.</comment>

<comment>నాయుడు దాని ఉత్తమ వద్ద మూర్ఖత్వం</comment>

<comment>This is challenge ..not challenge for leaders but people and their intellect in choosing the right leaders. Whenever a leader takes tough measures at revival people end up choosing leaders who throw freebies (this happened when Naidu exited in 2003 and YSR took over) the amount freebies doled out by YSR destroyed the whole economy and bifurcations woes added Naidu ended promising too many freebies himself which are now hitting him back? But here is a question to people let us assume Naidu takes all the risks and actually builds a new fantastic capital for AP will we give him the credit? Answer a Big NO  ask the current people in Hyderabad they mock him if he says he built hyderabad. Again we end up choosing wrong leaders to follow ..India reformist chief PV Narasimha rao never got his due and we sing praises of Rajiv and Sonia ...</comment>

<comment>So, it is evident that Naidu's current tenure  has been a total disaster on all fronts !!It is unfortunate that this chameleon got elected to power leveraging the short public memory of the gullible masses who after a decade of his alienation from office  just forgot the kind of scant disregard he showed to the farmers, artisans, weavers, small scale labourers and other vulnerable sections of society by pompously coronating himself as the CEO of AP rather than a Chief Minister by concentrating the development in the Metro Cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad which were already pampered a lot !!What can you expect from this turncoat and cut throat who stabbed his own father in law in the back and was in a way responsible for his death  by causing him huge distress by splitting the party and hijacking the MLAs !!</comment>

<comment>this author is a known Jagan fan. what else can you expect from his articles? But the reality is he is doing a good job considering the fact that he is not getting any support from center either financially or through special incentives to the state.</comment>

<comment>It's quite clear from YOUR OWN portrayal here most of the points mentioned above are NOT his own undoings. Points 7, 9 & 10 have certainly been disasters, above all he's supposed to run the state on exhausted fumes of treasury. How can anyone do that? With NO SUPPORT from center how does a CM run a state-- actually for point 9, how will the allotment of said 1000crs be made when the state has no money ... on top the subject of caste(s) and which section of society needs to be included in the list rests with Center.. hope you know abt Gujjars/ Patel agitations for quick reminder!Everyone (myself included) want many wishes fulfillment by the state... but realistic expectations need to be taken. CBN did manage success in other areas, why have they not found reference here??</comment>
