<comment>That's it! I'm done with the BJP, this is the last straw for me.</comment>

<comment>be politically agnostic like me, support good initiatives of all parties including BJP. BJP represents a community(upper caste hindus) and they are not going to go away, even if they lose elections now and then.</comment>

<comment>But this, I can't tolerate. I knew of the Hindutva risk involved if I elect BJP but this is too much. I'm not ready to live according to the dikhats of RSS and it's chaddi gang.   Even if BJP is gone tomorrow they will India be free of these superstitions?</comment>

<comment>What nonsense are these guys talking. What crisis are these megalomaniacs talking about. The world is running fine without them, just by renaming they think they are better. </comment>

<comment>If world is a fine place without them, why do you need to poke your dirty little middle finger?</comment>

<comment>''Sitting in the audience and making their presentations in due course will be 55 vice-chancellors of various Indian universities.''That is frightening .</comment>

<comment>Frightening to think that the fate of the nation is in the hands of people who believe this poppycock.</comment>

<comment>Feku today cried in Coimbatore that he is not against Dalits but this news says different view </comment>

<comment>how is this anti dalit?</comment>

<comment>It's a democracy. Chut$%%pa has the right to exist too</comment>

<comment>We are the chut$%%pa for having elected this moron who out-smarted a billion+ people with his marketing and ad campaigning of photoshoped pics and cooked up figures.</comment>

<comment>what is weird sounding? NASA is spending fotune is researching sanskrit  to see how best it can benifit computer programs effectiveness and ppl like you enjoy demeaning our heritage</comment>

<comment>I heard they ran out of funds and still did not find a thing.</comment>

<comment>no its still going on</comment>

<comment>Did they find anything ?</comment>

<comment>>> NASA is spending fotune is researching sanskritSimple: It did not. They only funded a small study of Briggs, who has been misquoted by many in India that Sanskrit has a CFG structure that is much more suitable for language processing algorithms. This is false.Having said that, there are many other genuinely proud scientific accomplishments that have come out of ancient India, that have later been developed upon by other civilizations and countries. It is worth pondering how to revive modern science in India, than to harp on false-feelgood-stories that somehow tries to convince that researching ancient indian scriptures will still yield new unknown results.In short, look to scientific literature than vedic literature if you want to revive Indian science.</comment>

<comment>SIMPLE IT DID NOT and that reveals that you are from PAPU or KEJRI brigadeMy cousin works in there and I know for sureno need to argue with ppl like you who has not knowledge</comment>

<comment>Cousin works in there and so you know about this research LOLI work with NLP researchers all the time, some from NASA. I bet you have never heard of Briggs or know what CFG is? LOLSo much for your "knowledgeful" comment :))</comment>

<comment>What is stopping our government to do what NASA is doing? Kejriwal or Muslims?</comment>

<comment>they are doing it an will do it slowly  sickulars can jump  and make noise no one cares</comment>

<comment>They are only making fools of themselves</comment>
