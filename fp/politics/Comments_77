<comment>Apples and Gulab Jamuns cannot go hand in hand either.Stupid comparison by RaGa</comment>

<comment>Itis a shame that this upstart of a politician, is addressed as Gandhi. Even RaGa should not be used. He should be called by his name in his Passport  viz., Raul Vinci or RaVi. He has no education and he wasted his youth. He is just a over grown KG Kid. The only asset he has, which is not mental, is the 1,76,000 crores in black, stashed in havens abroad ( this is as per wikileaks list published in the Hindu many months back, but strangely withdrawn within few hours). Modi is unable to get this out and hence this kid is revelling. The very fact that media was not allowed in the venue is an indication of how the party is preventing any disgrace. He knows nothing of technology or silicon valley. He only speaks what he is advised to speak by his joker advisers. He hardly understands what he talks. GOD bless the Congress.</comment>

<comment>they have chashed money in one single room where they stay......so no one can do search....because they ruled india and no one has right to search ...recent example .. Nentional herald case...</comment>

<comment>Now that David Hadley has mentioned Ishrat, RaGa says his testimony is all set up. Ishrat was a holy cow and the best of nationalists are students of JNU who held meeting to commemorate Afzal and talked of splitting India into pieces.</comment>

<comment>A failure in every department lectures India and technocrats about how to Progress India.What a shameful day for Technocrats to attend his lectures - do you have any shame left????And what a sad day for Indians, we have to hear from this guy who has not done anything for 8 years in parliament and last 2 years with zero outcome or a single Idea.</comment>

<comment>Can anyone pls tell me what worthwhile work he has done other than gracing funerals & getting noisier by the day ..., Why cant he work better than Modi & challenge him face off..than farting & shitting big time..fooling around & just whiling his time...My pets are clever than him atleast know to bark when required..</comment>

<comment>arey bus bhi kar!! aur kitna bakwaas karega.....khud toh kuch kaam kartah nahin hai, aur doosron ke kaam main taang adaata hai.......abhi bhi samay hai, maan jaa..... yeh netagiri tere bus ki nahin..... shimla-vimla jaa, seb uga, aur shaan se baaki ki zindagi basar kar!! rehne de politics, tujhse na ho payega!!</comment>

<comment>Extreme stupidity, idealogical bankruptcy and airheadedness also can not go hand in hand with ambition to lead a Nation, even if the ambition is inherited!</comment>

<comment>even if the startup is lets a ' young India '- pappu</comment>

<comment>Congress is intolerant of talent. That's why even talented people within Congress cannot progress because the top spot is permanently reserved.But Congress can surely claim credit for driving away a whole generation of talented Indians. That's why Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, Indra Nooyi and so on should come and give thanks to Congress.</comment>

<comment>What is he talking ?Startups in Silicon Valley dont have intolerance. Here also people with different racial backgrounds form groups, or like each other and hangout together.. Nothing can be done.Intolerance in US government - Racial bigotry, People who are anti-immigration, People who are anti-Mexican, anti-Cuban, anti- Latino creep the corridors of Washington.. There are so many incumbent Senators who come from different constituencies of thoughtSo, what happens in startups, and what happens in government are not related, even in USIn India,Startups don't have intolerance. or maybe the owners of the startups only want people of certain origin, state, language.. People who speak Malayalam, always want people who speak Malayalam to be their colleagues. Same with people who speak Telugu. People who speak Bengali always gang up together.. So, what can we do about it.. Nothing...Government has same level of intolerance like - people who are anti-Tamil, anti-Kashmir, anti-Bangladeshi, anti-Pakistani, anti-Hindu, anti-Muslim, Christian, etc..So, again, its the same in India like US.So. this intolerance debate is past its expiry date.. and the comparison is junk.</comment>

<comment>ROFl ...raga has told congress words to effect ' u can fight after elections but dont fight now'.....also wy oh why doesnt he promise the kerala public that there will  be no bandhs if they are elected to power, wahtever the reason...AH that none can do.or wants to do..not even CPM or CPI</comment>

<comment>Rahul is not happy becAuse tgevschrnevisht named after his family members. </comment>

<comment>That explains why no start ups or any talk about them during congress rule.</comment>

<comment>But saying India is intolerant and raising anti India slogan in JNU can go hand in hand</comment>

<comment>Of course, Rahul. I believe my country's politicians will never ever give importance to country but own narrow interests.You should not let Modi do work otherwise many of your kind of shops will close down after his 1st extremely successful tenure. So, you need to be intolerant to him and NDA govt. Keep it up.</comment>

<comment>v congress gave u freedom n food to eat  everything....atleast be faithful......to us.........</comment>

<comment>Yes. Also you gave us unheard record level of scams. Coal gate (1.8 lakh crore), 2g (1.6 lakh crore) .cwg, son in law ji, .... And total is infinity!!!! All you did was to threw some food in our bowl and looted us. Stripped us. Literally. </comment>

<comment>u deserve it.......</comment>

<comment>c u al il com later....................................HOPE ALL BJP BAKTS TAKE LEAVE FOR COMING FOR DAYS TILL 14th.............coz am here...</comment>

<comment>Chamchas of congress. How much of their loot do they give you a to write about the corrupt congress? I can fabricate good about them if I can get it too.  Where do I get it? </comment>

<comment>:) u cant write coz :)  ur uneducated like modiji :)</comment>

<comment>Kiran Majumdhar Shaw told that it appeared that Rahul Gandhi was leading lynch mobs against entrepreneurs. It is natural as Nehru onwards Gandhi's were a disaster without letup on India.</comment>

<comment> RAHUL OUR PURE PM 2020...........</comment>

<comment>Yes, and in 2020, Raga will kick your butt along with chamchas, be ready..</comment>

<comment>2 zeros.</comment>

<comment>ur modi il get 2 zeros..in 2020...wait n c...........did u c delhi ,banglore ,kerala,tamilnadu ,telengana,bihar.......................now c in punjab n assam also......c wat i il do to ur bjp n modi</comment>

<comment>with p&^*%s like this and Tharoor who blows his bugle in his homeland Britain with his clipped accent asking investors not to come to India.... who needs enemies? we are our own worst enemies..</comment>

<comment>If royalty and low IQ can go, then anything is possible. Go and ask any business man, how did they thrived for 6 decades, you will feel the real intolerance on your cheek</comment>

<comment>Nothing positive from kujliwal and pappu only negative words against modi. </comment>

<comment>Pappu is better than kujliwal. At least he entertains public.</comment>

<comment>But where is start up india ???I need details but no clue ... Only online forum ... That too is of no use ...Anyone has any details ???</comment>

<comment>It just has started. After next budget.</comment>

<comment>But Atleast a website ... Some criteria ... So priority industries ... Just hi decibel announcement .... Without any content or info ...It's very crucial for startups ... Even VCs and investors are holding back due to this ..utter disappointment ...</comment>

<comment>Moron start up is not for investors...It is for common youth.  By the way as per announcement it will be starting from April this year. Final touch to policies is underway. After budget things will be clear.</comment>

<comment>Aghast at the microbial iq of a person plus his audacity to call someone a moron without knowing what he's talking about ...Unless investors know what's the risk free or risk adjusted rate on which the government is facilitating finance to the startups ... How are they supposed to reposition ... In the meantime ... The startups which are negotiating with VCs or Angels need some sort of framework to leverage their pitch ...Go and hang your brain on your rooftop ... Idiot ...</comment>

<comment>The journalists brigade should refrain from reporting anything from the politician bag considering the IQ level and the character that goes into the analysis. Rahul should be educated and taught on the tolerance of the people of India on his nehru dynasty clan. High time we shunted the family to the yard for an endless clean-up session. Don't give the crap that Indians are fools and can be ruled by media and the scoundrels and vagabonds. Going by the current attitude may be the answer is YES</comment>

<comment>To all his fans, RaGa is the real Pappu. His comments, statements and thought process continue to draw people's attention to the fact that there are thousands of people with a pea-sized brain. I really wish for his long life and longer career at Congress.</comment>

<comment>when Raul Ghandhy gonna Die ?? worthless piece of shit...</comment>

<comment>After he single-handedly kills corrupts Congress party</comment>

<comment>dont know ....  why ur so unmatured ....hope god giv u gynanodhayam......i know u cant under stand..........but still let me tell u ..u istupid il always think stupidly....like @GUNSE007</comment>

<comment>what about Your Uncle vadras properties,,still counting..</comment>

<comment>So does dynasty and democracy. GTFO fake Gandhi.</comment>

<comment>tolerance towards corruption,looters and unemployment can certainly go together...only thing u have implemented so far u retard...hence this arrogance</comment>

<comment>This guy is a फकिंग मोरोण।</comment>

<comment>There is one start up required in Rahul's brain. God has forgotten to start it up.</comment>

<comment>haha  dr ads .....c wat i il do to u from today....i il do n do n dooodly dooo...</comment>

<comment>This is an standard pappu dialogue, which proves you are big fool as well. Do you know how many jobs and taxes it got in turn. It is better than congress stealing several billions & billions of dollars.Be a brilliant by reading some good news. don't be a fool by following pappu again</comment>

<comment>let me troll n make u cry....can u dare to with stand me ...........its open challenge</comment>

<comment>This is an standard coward dialogue. Again you are an same pappu guy with no substance.If you have any facts talk on facts without personal indulgance . Run away if you want to involve personally .</comment>

<comment>All you can do is personal accuse. You can personal accuse people as much you can. Which doesn't make you brave. Be a coward to even expose your name.Ask your coward friends as well to join you ... Good luck. Be a coward and feel good</comment>

<comment>haha madame became mum .......like MODI.......can u answer why ur modi sold land for 2 rs... ??? why did he do corruption...n send lalit modi to out of country ????? why vyapam scam ????</comment>

<comment>What is the point in speaking to an idiot like you and Pappu? You are good in speaking bad & foul language like MR.Kejariwal. If you are good enough to speak in good language people might engage in a debate. All you have got is a foul mouth to defend an dumb guy?As you say your id suits you.</comment>

<comment>i may hav not brushed ...in morning morning  but i dont foul....also....its my habit......so dont take about my personal...everyone il hav their own loves n disloves.......i never used bad word on u...till now...but u only used ...AM READY TO DEBATE ...but ur spoiling the debate coz ur not able to answer me..........also miss rajalakshmi pee................."PLEAE DONT TROLL ME .....coz am cute handsome sweet ...n well knowledged........." ...dont dont dont......................if u love then do healthy debate...dont be like ur other bjp fooliful bakra bakts.....atleast try to gain some wisdom from me though ur uneducated</comment>

<comment>chup bh0sdike</comment>

<comment>You don't have guts to reveal your name like Pappu. you are an idiot ID before now some thing else. Tomorrow id would be a "fools of congress"?There must be two things. One you don't know to read english or having an problem with your eyes. I have commented already why Modi is promoting industrialisation than Rahul promoting caste , rape and corruption.Selling land for free was started by Nehru if you know history or know to read wikipedia go and read it and better change your id to "Ignorant Pappu followers"</comment>

<comment>Fools of congress are good in insulting women and say women empowerment. They are also the same kind of dumb heads with no brains like Pappu.Its an bad strategy to use foul language like Sanjay Jha you lost already when you use petty language . "Petty followers and dumb masters" Please use this id for day after tomorrow.</comment>

<comment>he scolded me  and he can scold me coz he is my friend.......r u my friend ......, why r u supporting me ????....if ur my friend then scold me....</comment>

<comment> STOP CRYING.....</comment>

<comment>Britishers have handed over the strategy and trained us on how to divide and rule this country. Our leader follows the same strategy:- Divide the communities into Muslims and non-Muslims- Divide non-Muslims into Hindus and Christians- Divide Hindus into upper caste and lower caste- Divide the lower caste into BCs and SC/STsFinally bribe print and electronic media and start spreading hatred and stall progress using Rajya Sabha.Long live Nehru dynasty....long live Congress</comment>

<comment>Rahul Gandhi is a real joke regarding the question of human rights.  He constantly talks about intolerance on the part of the Narendra Modi and BJP administrations.  Rahul Gandhi disregards the fact  that Indra Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi have headed the Congress party and the Congress governments only on account of their race -- their Caucasian resemblance and identity; or else, who would vote for a bunch of incompetent, corrupt, and selfish family of scoundrels.</comment>

<comment>Pappu and knowledge also can not go hand in hand</comment>

<comment>This guy is a good entertainer. </comment>

<comment>Whatever it is he is making statements soon BJP will utter some crap and will backfire them sure </comment>

<comment>You have great experience of back getting fired since 2002.</comment>

<comment>This has already backfired on pappu. No need for BJP to make any statement...</comment>

<comment>We will wait one more month and sakshi yogi will open the motor mouth and then the fun starts </comment>

<comment>Sakshi is not BJP PM candidate. Pappu is Congi's PM candidate. Pathetic...</comment>

<comment>One must learn from RG how to be wise when not in power! ( and be silent when in power)</comment>

<comment>ur great ....</comment>

<comment>Phir bola ! Pappuda. Teri Ma ne tujhe tameez nahi sikhaayi ? Apne se badon ka aadar karte gain.</comment>
