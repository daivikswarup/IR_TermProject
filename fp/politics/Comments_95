<comment>who are you to decide that Kanhaiya  was trying to represent the views of Jawahar lal nehru or even Mahatma gandhi ? Kanhaiya is a traitor , a man who stands with Jihadi supporters. He is anti nationalist. jabardasti apne man se kahani na banao</comment>

<comment>Are you seroius ? None of the two can be the face of Indian nationalism. Here are a few who are face of Indian nationalism :Havaldar Abdul Hamid .P J Kurien.E Shredharan.Baba Amte.Captain Lakshmi Sahgal.And many many more unsung heroes who build India, who guard India and make India.</comment>

<comment>Is this article a joke?? IS this idiot Mishra trying to glamourize anti-nationalism? What the hell is going on at Firstpost???</comment>

<comment>Firspost has waged a war against Rss,all past authors have been chosen to spread lies and venom against Natioalist in India. None of the articles have any truth behind them</comment>

<comment>he is a gaddar ,just like you , a muslim hater, whoc ant see Hindus in power</comment>

<comment>It should be Vikram Chauhan, the man who risked breaking law to uphold the integrity and dignity of the mother land. Laws should be respected but integrity, dignity & respect of the country is much higher than any law and should be upheld at any cost irrespective of few individuals rights or whims. Individuals rights are not above the nation, they come under the nation. If one does not have respect, love and loyalty for the nation they have no moral right to live in that nation. They are free to go & live in any other country where they can feel love and loyalty for that nation.</comment>

<comment>Vikram Chauhan over Kanhaiya any day, any time!</comment>

<comment>It is too late for such a choice, Mr Mishra. One-third of our fellow citizens already chose the face of our nation, back in May 2014: The face which is a living nightmare to the survivors of the 1044 massacred in Gujarat in 2002, the face of hate and bigotry and the face fronting the entrenched Manuwadis of Nagpur.Indians have made the same fateful decision which (1/3rd of) Germans made back in 1932 and paid dearly for it. We are left only to hope and pray India won't meet the same fate as Germany did between 1932 and 1945.</comment>

<comment>Sad, but seems to be true!</comment>

<comment>What is more important than his being Anti national is Kanhiyah is not an Individual [rather he is ANTI INDIVIDUAL] - he is a CPI worker, who was powerful enough to Impose emergency along with Indira Gandhi. He will protest Afzal Guru execuation but he will not say a word on murder of merit an Indiviudual right. Rather he wants people themselves to murder Individual rights so that he can impose his single party collective dictatorship=================================================================================Rohit Vemula was also a goon who assaulted ABVP person. They are from the ruling gang [as subset of population]. They are pro-reservation. Perhaps Rohit vemula recognized the emptiness of his life and committed suicide.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------When a person scores above 94% and another gets same seat for 49% in an EXAMINATION when the examiners dont know the examinees then merit does not exist because it has been murdered. A person who was murdered did exist. So also merit.That is the argument of relative morality of Mixed economy, a fascist economy - because measure and morals is a product of ones upbringing they dont exist. What is only moral is what the Constitution and mafia politicians laws state.Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim’s gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of money taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials and mafia politicians.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, but that it cannot be used honestly.Why does not the state allot a seat strictly on merit and snatch it away OPENLY?</comment>

<comment>I fully agree with you. He is anti national .Period. but don't you think ,he must have been very young at the time of emergency 1975.may not even have joined CPI at that time. any by the way their another organization whose chief wrote from Yervada Jail that his organisation would be at the disposal of the Government "for national uplift" if the ban on the organzation  were lifted and its  members freed from jail. Vikram is the epitome of justice, he is a superman, who delivers instant justice ,who is judge and prosecutor rolled into one and from where you can get such a multi tasking man. He know how to leverage IT uses whatsaap for collecting everybody , does not bother to response to police summons because he himself is Police apart from prosecutor and Judge. we live in interesting times and Vikram is true face of this time.</comment>

<comment>HA HA VERY YOUNG = NOT YET BOTN, HIS AGE IS 28 AND 2016-1975 = 41</comment>

<comment>Vikram Chauhan is not the reason for India being a Ocholocracy[mob rule].  More importantly Kanhaiya is anti-Individual[read carefully]Rajiv Goswami was the first student to attempt self-immolation while a student at Delhi University in October, 1990 to protest against Prime Minister V.P. Singh's implementation of the Mandal Commission laws for Affirmative Action (reservation) recommendations. His action sparked a series of self-immolations by college students and led to a formidable movement against job reservations for backward castes, as recommended by the Mandal CommissionSurinder Singh Chauhan was the first student to perform self-immolation while an evening student of Deshbandhu College (Delhi University) on September 24, 1990 to protest against implementation of the Mandal Commission recommendation for reservation to candidates based on birth. He left a suicide note stating that "The responsibility for my death lies with those people who consider reservation a vote bank, people like V.P. Paswan, Yadav</comment>

<comment>a right, comkmies imposed emergency and got theri asses locked in jails while Devi indira sat at the throne</comment>

<comment>What we would very much like is not to see your face, or read your articles (which we anyway usually don't, and come to the comment section, given that you write either paeans to that duuffer, or gibberish when you are not doing so. That is what we would like. Please, can you do that for us?</comment>

<comment>Well, it depends. If you are on the left, you are going to root for Kanhaiya and if you are the right you obviously choose Vikram Chauhan. Both these individuals represent these sides perfectly. One is trying to bring change from the inside, trying to do the right thing, correcting the historical mistakes and holding a mirror to the society as it is today. The other is a thug - no doubt about that - emotional, tries to prove his point through shouting, muscle power - truth be damned. Hang one to satisfy the other side.</comment>

<comment>I have made my considered choice. I would any day choose Vikram Chauhan over Kanhaiah kumar[a secessionist legal robber by socialist strategy  and murderer of merit, reservation policy,  by socialist tactics]Rajiv Goswami attempted self immolation but did not die. There was Surinder Singh Chauhan who died of self immolation - Surinder Singh Chauhan was the first student to perform self-immolation while an evening student of Deshbandhu College (Delhi University) on September 24, 1990 to protest against implementation of the Mandal Commission recommendation for reservation to candidates based on birth. He left a suicide note stating that "The responsibility for my death lies with those people who consider reservation a vote bank, people like V.P. Paswan, Yadav ..."</comment>

<comment>Stop singing this monotonous tune of " murder of merit". In order to be murdered, the damn thing has to exist. Merit never existed in this country, in the first place. We are a country that is in love with deferential parroting. How can merit exist in such circumstances. </comment>

<comment>I just changed my mind. To Bhakts. Wake up. If you are a BJP supporter you will be sold. Look at how Jats will get reservation by reservation thuggery.

<comment>When a person scores above 94% and another gets same seat for 49% in an EXAMINATION when the examiners dont know the examinees then merit does not exist because it has been murdered. A person who was murdered did  exist. So also merit.That is the argument of relative morality of Mixed economy, a fascist economy - because measure and morals is a product of ones upbringing they dont exist. What is only moral is what the Constitution and mafia politicians  laws state.A “mixed economy” is a society in the process of committing suicide. Modi and rajnath Singh are commiting a sin in following the nehruvian model of mixed economy and also they have not denounced Vajpayee's Gandhian Socialism[ MK sold his supportes the Hindus to purchase good will of Jinnah and Muslims and Socialism is legal robbery - which is why the consensus gang loves him. The struggle against Modi for tolerance is to chain him down to the consensus space.If a nation cannot survive half-slave, half-free, consider the condition of a nation in which every social group becomes both the slave and the enslaver of every other group. Ask yourself how long such a condition can last and what is its inevitable outcome.When government controls are introduced into a free economy, they create economic dislocations, hardships, and problems which, if the controls are not repealed, necessitate still further controls, which necessitate still further controls, etc. Thus a chain reaction is set up: the victimized groups seek redress by imposing controls on the profiteering groups, who retaliate in the same manner, on an ever widening scale.Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim’s gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice.

<comment>Dude, you and I are talking at completely different wavelengths. I am saying 94% is memorised facts and 49% shows a lesser ability to memorise scholastic facts, as many generations of certain people were kept away from memorising scholastic tasks and academia.You call the same 94 % and 49 % as being reflections of " merit" and moan the murder of which I say never existed in the first place.By supporting " Free economy" and deriding " Socialism" you are implying the olden days of removing strategies of providing supports for the discriminated and thereby maintain inequity.Gosh, we two, are residents of two different universes. </comment>

<comment>What nonsense. The winner in any competition be the winner is merited. If you are foolish enough as owner of YOUR company want to fill up people with 49% so be it - nobody will question you. You must be a scoundrel of the highest order you want to do experiments with OTHER peoples money .I know you are not foolish enough to believe in your own arguments. reservation policy has created a few Government brahmins [people who support and benefit from reservation policy] and because competition is killed currency has structurally collapsed - with the result that cooks, drivers, nurses, doctors, carpenters are fleeing your gaga land of reservation and socialism.Read my other posts completely and patiently.</comment>

<comment>A new theory has to be built up to explain why some Indians still stick to communism/socialism when the system has been SHOWN to produce hyperinflation genocide and single party slavery. Let us take the help of Freud----------------------------------------------------------------------------------What if some Indians want to screww mother and Indians want to screww motherland?? Is this the reason why Indian men have difficulty in have girl friends and India does not want to get involved in wars outside India, and is deeply INWARD looking?Sigmund Freud father of psychoanalysis said "mother worship" when asked to define India. Continuing this analysis::Arnab Goswami goes slightly wrong when he says even left loves India. Love non-mediated by religion turns motherly love to love for female. That is why Left is intent of screwwing India. That love is sexual love for mother, motherland. Jats and Kapus in Andhra Pradesh[who have burnt a train] are demanding reservation. That is again immoral sexual love for motherland.Such effect of predatory sexual love for motherland [nothing wrong with motherly love]has even led to murder of motherland in history as following shows..Dahir was BRAHMIN King in Sindh. By enlisting the support of local tribes (such as the Jats, Meds and Bhuttos) and Buddhist rulers of Nerun, Bajhra, Kaka Kolak and Siwistan as infantry to his predominantly-mounted army, Muhammad bin Qasim defeated Dahir and captured his eastern territories for the Umayyad Caliphate.Dahir then tried to prevent Qasim from crossing the Indus River, moving his forces to its eastern banks. Eventually, however, Qasim crossed and defeated forces at Jitor led by Jaisiah (Dahir's son). Qasim fought Dahir at Raor (near modern Nawabshah) in 712, killing him; Dahir's wife immolated herself (with other women in her household) in accordance with the Hindu tradition of Jauhar.=========================================================Academicians have swallowed a fascist lie spread by media that India is a democracy.What a Joke! What about the assault on Individual right of merit by reservation policy? In which country are cities brought to a halt by bandhs? Media should first say India was a Ocholocracy[mob rule].India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] not a democracy. Free speech can be explosive unless it is a part of movement to uproot the Ocholocracy. In a Ocholocracy INDIVIDUAL rights are murdered by definition with help of state. Examples of murder of INDIVIDUAL right are reservation policy which is murder of merit, an INDIVIDUAL right and socialism(by definition legal robbery) which is murder property right, another INDIVIDUAL right.Why are Indians not trusted with free gun laws as in USA? Answer to this simple question demolishes free speech argument.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why were leftists associated with secessionists? The culture of socialist legal robbery is manifesting itself as secessionism - because the socialists may have realized it is impossible to come to an understanding on who the supreme dictator should be and they want to establish numerous single part dictatorships over fragments of country. Socialism has to lead to single party dictatorships over fragments of country.Adam Smith, the father of economics, says in economics Man Proposes and God Disposes. If every body in a nation become do-gooders -- God disposes -- and we will have hell on earth. if man proposes to be selfish -- God again disposes -- and we will have prosperity and peace.Giving rational explanation of God, the elder do-gooders , MK Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Ambedkar etc forgot that a strong socialist state is required to do good. And it will demand its pound of flesh closest to the heart – rampant corruption. A strong state emerges in an environment of shortages – to distribute scant resources. Any socialist state will NOT destroy the reason for its existence. 24 hour water supply will reduce water required to be released by 30%. No Government Engineer in India will accept this. Scarcity, distress is required for the reason for its existence. If no scarcity exists it will manufacture it. Mysore had water scarcity even though it had KRS dam beside it. It is a question of power. A society can either have equality or freedom but never both. Why? To enforce equality a strong and intrusive state is required. Stateism is against Individualism and kills freedom.Since 1947, the political parties, government need not care as they have attained emancipation from democracy -- principally by the tool of reservation policy, where vote banks are formed. And they will vote according to predictable patterns whatever the rulers do or don't do. In other words India has become a Fascist state[socialism is a necessary component of it --Nazi means National Socialist]by the vehicle of reservation policy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just voting does not make India democracy. Protection of rights of the smallest minority the INDIVIDUAL MAKES A SYSTEM DEMOCRATIC. The problem is, India is an Ocholocracy[mob rule] where Individual rights are murdered[example is murder of merit an Individual right by reservation policy and property rights by socialism. Socialism is legal robbery.A period of good dictatorship may be required to cure Indians of disease of bad democracy, due to the infection of socialism or legal robbery. Otherwise bad democracy can kill in millions like in Cambodia under Pol Pot. Ocholocracy looks like democracy but it is not. Just look at immorality of Indians- Laloo the reason for largest migration of Biharis from Bihar was reelected.-----------------------------------------------------------It is logically wrong to allow communist parties to function in a multi party democracy as they are for single party dictatorship - they openly state it! Ban communist parties===================================================Now BJP/RSS should bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=============================================</comment>

<comment>Neither is representative of the nation, and doesn't deserve to be our poster boy.</comment>

<comment>"A powerful section of the media, in connivance with other forces in the country, is out to divide the country on this question. They are out to brand a whole lot of Indians as anti-nationals in their own country." spearheaded by the greatest & loudest TV Anchor of the world, and who is even greater than  Tim Sebastian of BBC</comment>

<comment>If it is Nazi Germany, 'Desa Drohis' would have been shot dead on the spot. Since it is not Nazi Germany, they are still posing as fighters to a cause.</comment>

<comment>The BJP Govt is confused. Instead of pragmatic approach, tt prefers opportunistic and popular governance. Since the assembly election dates in five states are nearing, BJP is much more worried. If the police uses force to control the situation then 24X7 media starts crying. If the police becomes inactive and the general public takes law in their hands then also the Govt is blamed. Unfortunately a middle path that can satisfy all including media, govt and public is not available. Last week, SFI activists attacked the former diplomat TP Srinivasan in Kovalam, Kerala. Disciplinary action was taken against there police officers and a Sub Inspector for inaction. Police has become a punching bag for all politicians. Sreenivasan blamed police for failing to act. CPI(M) district secretary Kadakampally Surendran alleged  a “conspiracy behind the police inaction”</comment>

<comment>The whole issue is getting boring now unfortunately. I think media has milked it dry. People have gotten tired outraging. Give them a break to replenish.</comment>

<comment>The break will come after the state assembly elections. The medias will take a two month long vacation</comment>

<comment>Neither. </comment>

<comment>Checkout new sickular argument after they have been caught with their pants down!Kanhaiya didnt make anti India slogans...some infiltrators did...so arresting Kanhaiya is wrong!! LOL!Dear LOW IQ sickulars...what was Kanhaiya and 200 other students doing there?? and why didnt they stop if someone infiltrated????NO ANSWER!!</comment>

<comment>A few video clips have emerged recently from unclaimed RSS sources... JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar is charged sedition, beaten in court and put behind bar on the basis of it and a frenzy is created allover the country... BUT why there is no attempt, yet, officially to verify the authenticity and genuineness of these clips... Why? Why?? Why??? Is not the Fascism knocking at the door of India?The storm-trooper 'Bhakts' may brand me anti-National and abuse in filthy language for raising this question... BUT these questions are bound to reverberate among the people of India in coming days.....</comment>

<comment>Beaten in court?? LOL. You just exposed yourself!</comment>

<comment>wrong question. the choice is Afzal or hanumanthappa. who do you think is the hero?</comment>

<comment>Oh u liar communist idiot Akshaya - the correct answer is none of the 2. The face of the nation is NaMo, period. Don't by a psycho and a do-nothing fellow to muse the way you do. Nehru was a buffoon and the main cause of India's problems today. So stop saying anything good about that idiot and his progenies.</comment>

<comment>When EVERYTHING FAILED...Congress and Commies have taken refuge under a brainless pseudo activist trying to and eulogize terrorists!</comment>

<comment>It appears on face like it boomeranged,thinking so might be a solace for rationale Indians;But the greater design behind this fake nationalism euphoria  could be polarising the society against minority communities and progressive,rationale and liberal Indians.Yes this is a litmus test for India.which side its going to chose?.Hitler (Nazis) did the same thing and got success for a short period of time. Finally they were defeated but not before the loss of millions of lives.This is a high time that a united front should be launched against this fascist onslaught comprising all non Hindutva forces before it's too late.</comment>

<comment>Neither.</comment>

<comment>Kanhayya kumar is the face of the nation.</comment>

<comment>BJP is a failed in all fronts his goons creating law and order situation in the country everyday and entire govt wasting time on beef and buffalo politics only, nation is going towards down, what ever got from congress even we are going to worst under BJP rule</comment>

<comment>total failure of cong and commies strategies</comment>

<comment>Mishra is setting up a straw man to topple over easily! This is the extent of the leftist discourse in this country. Intellectually bankrupt, tactically wily, and ideologically antinational.</comment>

<comment>Intellectually bankrupt, tactically wily, and ideologically antinational - Perfecto. Describes the right wing very well.</comment>

<comment>The face of the Indian Nation is, not should be, Hanumanthappa !!!! And, all those protecting the national boundaries!If India makes like of Gilani, Kanhiya, Shahela Rashid, Umar Khalid, the face of the nation, then we better get ready for "Bharat Ki Barbaadi" "Bharat Ke Tukdey", "Kerala, Kashmir... etc. ki Azadi, InashaAllah, InshaAllah" !!</comment>

<comment>Kanhaiya Kumar ofcourse</comment>

<comment>Pls dont tell me tht a person shouting slogans for breaking up India can be my idol. For obvious lack of choice I vote for the other guy. There can be no negotiations against my country's pride.</comment>

<comment>Even after the thorough expose you are still parroting the fake "truth"... Is this not called Goebbeltian truth?</comment>

<comment>Stupid ......your "thorough prob" is sponsored ..... ha ha :-)))</comment>

<comment>Whether it is the stupidity of RSS thinktanks or Mome Ministry or Delhi Police or ABVP, they have badly lost this battle to capture the mind of the youth of India.... The conspiracy has finally boomeranged...</comment>

<comment>Kumar did the action, while Chauhan did the reaction. Please justify the action of making anti-nation speeches and then ask for justification of the reaction to it. Or, prove that the statements were never made...</comment>

<comment>some say he did not make the anti nation speech.  he was just standing among the crowd. which is correct?</comment>

<comment>Well... some would also say he was playing carrot in his hostel</comment>

<comment>If the reaction is violent, then Chauhan is automatically wrong.</comment>

<comment>There goes another one ... has no guts to talk about the action .... </comment>

<comment>If the action is non-violent, the reaction cannot be violent. Doesn't matter what the provocation is.</comment>

<comment>Welll... there you go again... trying to hide your head in the sand.... is a wrong reaction an excuse or a justification for a wrong action?</comment>

<comment>Except that it wasn't even a wrong action. The SC has very clearly said that sedition laws can only be applied to armed rebellion against the state. In this, no violence was planned, or carried out. So legally there is nothing wrong with what he said. It's a joke, and a drama. He will be free soon.But what the lawyers did was illegal. Action = legal. Reaction = illegal. Do we really need to discuss this further?</comment>

<comment>Super.. good to see you talk about the action. Kindly justify why talking (including inciting others) of destroying india is right?</comment>

<comment>He was "inciting others"? Did he tell them to pick up guns and storm parliament? Did he tell them to rig elections? Did he tell them to kidnap politicians? All of these count as "destroying India". If he didn't say any of this, what exactly was he inciting others to do hmmm?Also note. This article is about the lawyer's actions - not really about what this JNU guy said. So if you have to pick between criminals and a peaceful person, which would you choose?</comment>

<comment>Appreciate your skill of avoiding the topic .... please look up the dictionary for the meaning of inciting .... anyway thanks for not denying that the guys spoke of destroying india. As for the article ... it again talks about the reaction .... which would not have happened if an incorrect action did not happen .. So, you are in favor of people coming out on streets and supporting those who ambushed our parliament and those who openly talk about destroying the country, right? </comment>

<comment>Notice how you didn't specify exactly what "destroying India" is. Also notice that you use the word "inciting", but once again refuse to show me what exactly he was inciting people to do. Exactly which action was he "inciting" them to take.And I disagree - it doesn't matter how "incorrect" you think the reaction is. It doesn't justify an illegal reaction. Yes, I am in favor of people saying whatever they want as long as they don't talk about actual violence. Even if that means talking of splitting up India. I don't bother about words without violence attached to them.</comment>

<comment>Well... i already asked you to look up the dictionary for " inciting". Please delink your thpughts from the reaction. Lets focus on the action. So, are you saying that you have no problems with Hafeez Sayeed making anti india statements and thereby creating an army of militants, as long as no court has found him guilty?</comment>

<comment>I wonder if you yourself have looked at the definition for "incite". It means to encourage others to engage in illegal actions. Note the word "illegal". So tell me...please tell me...what illegal action was the JNU student encouraging his followers to take hmmm?And militants use violence. As long as there is no talk of violence, no plans for violence, and no actual violence, I don't care if they discuss the break up of India, I don't care if they insult soldiers, and I don't care if they talk about surrendering Kashmir.No violence = I don't care.</comment>

<comment>So, you are okay with someone peacefully asking another to destroy the country? You want to wait till someone who has been hearing this discussion to come and blow up your home before taking action</comment>

<comment>Lol, why will someone hear this discussion and blow up my home? If they were going to blow up my home anyway, this discussion won't change their mind. If they weren't going to blow up my home, this discussion won't encourage them to do that. What kind of weird argument are you trying to make?</comment>

<comment>So, you believe a nation can be destroyed within the legal frame work, and if that happens you are fine with it... no voilence, no plans of violence, no actual violence.. awesome thoughts...</comment>

<comment>How can you destroy a nation without actual violence? Give me an example.</comment>

<comment>Neither. Just as FP cannot represent the high ethical values of Indian journalistic system. I am logging off for forever from FP. They are behaving worse than any other paid media in India. Till now I thought FP team will have some shame, but their articles are becoming worse day after day and that too without any remorse. #boycottFP</comment>

<comment>Hon'ble Gen BakshiI am very angry and hurt that a distinguished soldier like has cried because of anti national stand taken by so called liberals and secularists. But rest assured that you have shown us the way to respect the tri-colour and nation. We will teach these traitors a nation</comment>

<comment>Please watch a video of Retd. General Bakshi crying during a Newshour Debate of hoisting a tricolor. These liberal and sickular  bxxxxxxs have made a soldier cry in dispair.....Let us resolve that we will make that soldier happy again with our dedication to nation. We will crush these anti-nationals elements with unity. Vande Mataram</comment>

<comment>Who was the moron that banned the screening of 'The Da Vinci Code' in Kerala and Bengal??That's who I'd like to be the Face of the nation?</comment>

<comment>Did The Da Vinci Code ban in Kerala? Who are you moron! I've seen it here in my native tongue Malayalam.</comment>

<comment>It was banned in WB.It was banned in Kerala initially, it was the HC that stepped in.</comment>

<comment>No it was never banned in Kerala. Use google, before propagating nonsense.</comment>

<comment>In a country called India there lived a liberalHating anything Indian was of course naturalDadri murder he described as a gruesome lynchingAnd Malda riots he ignored without even mentioningMurders of some activists he protested loudlyMedals given by anti-sikh rioters he paraded proudlyCleansing of Kashmiri Pandits was never worth adiscussionBut killing of a terrorist caused deep frustrationHanging of Afzal and Yakub was an act of violenceDeaths in Pathankot didn’t even drew condolenceFor him Ishrat Jahan was not a terroristNaturally patriotic Indian was on his hit listAnti-National Slogans at JNU are freedom of ExpressionSinging Vande Mataram drove them to depressionHis dislike of Hindus was very visceralThat’s why he was called a TRUE SECULAR</comment>

<comment>Well said</comment>

<comment>Can the author explain the criteria for comparison between cheese and shit?</comment>

<comment>The face of India is the bengaluru lad, while being cut in half urged people to donate his eyes.The face of India is Hanumanthappa and hundreds like him who quietly do their duty. The face of India is Neerja Bhanot and Jyoti Singh.The face of India is the nameless, faceless farmer. The face of India is the announcer who saved thoudands in CST duting26/11and many many more.Not the rabble rouser Kanhaiya, loser Vemula or goonda lawyer Chauhan. </comment>

<comment>Vikram Chauhan by a long margin. He is not a hypocrite. He is not ungrateful to his motherland unlike Kanhiya, the despicable anti- national and a friend of separatists.</comment>

<comment>Chauhan doesn't believe in the law. Therefore he is anti-national. Without laws, there is no India.</comment>

<comment>No, he does. That is why he chose to be a lawyer. However, lawyers too are humans. They too get upset when someone threatens to dismember and destroy their country.</comment>

<comment>I don't know why he chose to be a lawyer. But he should know that India is not just physical boundaries. India means rule of law. If he has a problem, let him file a case. Especially a lawyer should know how to keep his hands to himself. It's very clear that these thug lawyers do not believe in the law. They are way, way more anti-national than these JNU guys.We don't need these types of anti-national thug lawyers in India.</comment>

<comment>You do not have any choice. The Constitution of India gives its citizens the right to pursue any profession.Thanks for agreeing that the JNU guys are anti - nationals.</comment>

<comment>The lawyers are from JNU? What???</comment>

<comment>I do not think an anti- national hub can produce lawyers, naxalites may be.You said that the lawyers are way, way more anti- national than these JNU guys . Does it not mean that both are anti - national. The difference is only that of degree. Some are less while some are more anti - national.</comment>

<comment>Depends on how you define "anti-national". There are no dictionary definitions, and in any case, being anti-national is not a crime. Breaking the law however, is definitely a crime. I don't care about what a person thinks. I only care about what they do.</comment>

<comment>If being anti - national is not a crime then nothing  wrong you do can be characterized as crime.  Anti - nationalism or gaddari is the most heinous crime a person can commit. A person does what he does only after giving it a thought.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense. Who am I harming if someone is "anti-national"? Do they prevent you from eating? From sleeping? Does it harm your freedoms? Does it harm anyone? No! What kind of stupid crime is this that doesn't harm people?Being "anti-national" isn't and can never be a crime. We can't have "thought crimes" in India.</comment>

<comment>you are harming the nation of which you are a citizen. Here I am assuming that you are a citizen of India. You are putting into jeopardy the freedom of the country you ate living in, eating the food provided by it and enjoying the facilities given to you. The genesis of crime lies in the thought process of an individual/organisation. Thinking hw to destroy India is a crime because when you think of harming someone or something there is always a possibility that you would put your thought  into practice. So, do not act childish and recognize that being anti - national is the gravest crime one can commit.</comment>

<comment>Give me an example of how exactly this will "harm India". Will Parliament stop functioning? Will the courts stop working? Will the army vanish? Will elections be rigged? Show me the actual harm, instead of talking in generalities.Being violent is the gravest crime one can commit. No one bothers about non-violent words and thoughts.</comment>

<comment>Gladly. The country's enemies will get emboldened and may attack it  safe in the knowledge that there were people, anti- nationals, inside which will help them in their nefarious designs of subjugating it. If anti - nationals enter Parliament they will pass laws inimical to the country. If they become judges their decisions will be against the interests of the country and its people. If the anti -nationals join the army country's security will be compromised. There will be nobody to stop the enemy army from occupying the country. Rigging elections will be no big deal if anti -nationals occupy the posts of election commissioners, election staff and police.In short, the anti- nationalism strikes at the very root of your existence as a free and sovereign country and society. The harm is incalculable.</comment>

<comment>So you're saying that JNU students will help carry out bombing attacks? Show me where they said that. Or if "anti-nationals" enter parliament (democratically elected) and pass laws, I have no problems with that. At all. Give me examples of these laws you're so afraid of. Let's see what is so dangerous about them!Show me where JNU students have told army people not to do their job and "let the enemy army occupy the country". Show me where JNU students have said rigging elections is ok.All this is in your own imagination. Nothing like that is being planned.</comment>

<comment>What I have said applies to all anti - nationals whether they are in the JNU or outside it. All of them are capable of carrying out bombing attacks too because they are loyal neither to the country nor to its people.When the entire election machinery will be manned and occupied by anti nationals, how would the elections be democratic? Moreover, what is the guarantee that there will be elections at all. You may not have problem with that but the people who love this country definitely do.Anti - nationals, since they do not have any love for the country's territorial integrity, may pass laws conceding Indian territory to her enemies. They may declare that Kashmir is not a part of India and Pakistan can have it. Same for Arunachal Pradesh which may be handed over to China. Assam and parts of West Bengal may be gifted or sold to Bangladesh.When anti- nationals are in the Army do you think they will fight  and be ready to sacrifice their lives fighting against the enemy. When they do not love the country why will they risk their lives for her. Do not limit it to the JNU. I am talking about all anti-nationals and of course the JNU is at the fore front of producing them.When anti-nationals will be calling shots there will be no country whom you will be able to call yours. Some other country will occupy it and you will be slaves again.</comment>

<comment>First of all, why would "anti-nationals" join the army in the first place? Only those who want to fight for their country would join. Others will simply do something else. Second, if we legally pass laws ceding Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh, let it happen. Who cares? If the people want it, who are you to say otherwise?But I disagree about being slaves again. Even your "anti-nationals" don't want to be slaves. I personally don't love India, but I will not want Pakistan to take over because I don't want to live in an Islamic regime. So your fears are illogical and ridiculous.Your problem is that you have too broad a definition of "anti-nationals". In your mind, all anti-nationals hate India. Not true. I don't hate India, but I don't love it either. I don't want India to fall, but I don't care about Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh or whatever. The only importance is militarily. If we need it for defence purposes, let it remain. Otherwise whatever benefits us.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, I did not know that I was interacting with a lunatic.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, I did not know I am interacting with a lunatic</comment>

<comment>So basically you have no argument. Fine. It's not as if I expected anything else.</comment>

<comment>Can I have a bit of whatever you are smoking! A goonda is acceptable to you as face of the nation, simply because he mouths inananities that are acceptable to you and does not mouth inananities that are unacceptable to you!!!</comment>

<comment>Have you heard the word 'hookah'? It promotes community smoking. Try it. All the anti - national germs in your body will get killed and you will become a nationalist.</comment>

<comment>Aha, I do not engage in gundagardi and I do not act like a Thekedharni of patriotism, I must therefore be anti national. </comment>

<comment>Not necessarily but if you support anti -  nationals then you too are an anti- national. If you  have patriotism in your blood, you need not fear anybody but if you have anti - nationalism in your blood, you will be afraid of your own image.</comment>

<comment>Thank you dadaji. Perhaps you then define nationalism and patriotism for me and how crossing those definitions constitute being an anti national. </comment>

<comment>Nationalism is love for your nation, love for the people of your nation, dedication and devotion for the welfare of its people, determination to protect it from external and internal aggression. Patriots do all these things and hence they are also called nationalists. Being anti - national is like cutting the hand that feeds you. I don't know whether you know enough Hindi to understand the meaning of a couplet i am quoting here. The story goes like this.  There was this big banyan tree on which there were many nests and different kind of birds were living in those nests. Among those was a pair of old pigeons. One day a big fire broke out and it engulfed the tree. Birds started flying out of their nests on the tree for safer places. Seeing that the old pair of pigeons was not showing any signs of moving out, a younger bird asked them why were they not leaving the burning tree, were they not afraid of burning? This couplet is the answer of that pair of old pigeons to that young bird.' Phal khaye iss ped ke, gande keene paat,Dharam hamara kaht hai, jaren issi ke saath'.Do not ask me to translate it into English because that language is not rich enough to convey the feeling in this couplet.</comment>

<comment>You are a very confused man. If you did not have the rather limited focus of " Nationalism" you would be even more confused. Survival, gratitude, love of belonging are all different things, but have become one big kichdi in your mind.I don't know if you know Kannada at all. When confronted with intelligent people who preferred not to use their intelligence, my grandmother would say, " Huccho? Beppo? Shiva leeleno?". I can't translate that adequately to English or Hindi. Not that either are not rich enough, just that I wouldn't want to lose the original resonance. Also, this saying could be well used for me. </comment>

<comment>Since I do not know Kannada, it is better for me to let the issue of what is nationalism and what is not rest there.</comment>

<comment>is this the best you can do ? what poverty of imagination.  !!  Please look below for better choices.  If you dont have anything  constructive to write just shut up.</comment>

<comment>I would rate the young man Madhav Mishra, running a street food joint at night, in Khar, Mumbai, while attending school during day time as the face of the nation. Spirited. Unlike the viles of JNU and its defenders</comment>

<comment>Chauhan</comment>

<comment>The hero of India's English media is now Kanhiya Kumar and his buddy Umar...but I bet if you take a poll of JNU Commies on who the real 'hero' for them is, it may be toss up between Afzal Guru and Ajmal Kasab</comment>

<comment>Done mein se koi nahin. We need liberal, forward looking, progressive leaders. </comment>

<comment>NONE, Sant Kabir would be more appropriate.</comment>

<comment>This Kanhaiya dude is a shame to his parents. The parents thought their son would resemble Lord Krishna, but in reality their son is follower of the asur king Kans.So, their is no choice really. Kanhaiya is a criminal.</comment>

<comment>Between the two of them,why would the moronic author even for one moment think any Indian would support the AsssHole who supports terrorists,anti-India activities and throws parties when Indian soldiersare killed?!!!Does the author and his KIND support terrorists by any chance??</comment>

<comment>Arre bhaiya AAP to senti ho gaye... Ama yaar sach likunga to bikega kaise... Ganda hai par dhanda hai ye...</comment>

<comment>To my knowledge Big B is getting that chance !!</comment>

<comment>Now photo of K with Nitishwa is out .Is that why Nitishwa was defending K sitting thousands of miles far ?</comment>

<comment>Bihar ka beta haei</comment>

<comment>oh is it , where is the photo - just for info . do we hear sickulars shouting doctored</comment>

<comment>Well done Mr. Chauhan.  I am glad to see someone stand up for India. We need more such bold people.The article as usual is biased not true journalism at all.</comment>

<comment>Writer is suffering from comparamania !!!</comment>

<comment>Correction I meant tunnel ision.</comment>

<comment>Writer as usual has tunnel gvision.</comment>

<comment>I DONT WANT BOTH OF this face. ONE IS GIVING UMBRELLA FOR ANTI NATIONAL POPLE AND OTHER ONE IS DOING GOONDAGIRI and Cheap publicity.</comment>

<comment>It is not goondagiri. It is patriotism and commendable.</comment>

<comment>We must try to be a more mature nation. If any calamity occurs in, say Japan, they maintain calmness and behave with utmost dignity. They will not wail and rant and cause public stampede or riots even if a situation called for. During the great tsunami in the aftermath, western even journalists were shocked and surprised to see the calm with which they managed the crisis. They helped each other, maintained calm and stood in queues for long hours without any complaint. Nobody stole  any possessions lying around the streets. Society does not call each other names. And here, we are always bickering even for small things. Now do not say that the Japanese are not patriots. Nobody is as patriotic as a Japanese.</comment>

<comment>Precisely.. Till date I have never seen any commie jnu free loader coming to rescue of people it's always defence forces and other religious organisations like sgpc , RSS ,vhp, and don't know the name of the organisation of ulema at sharanpur.. But these religious entities are the ones look down upon by these commie free loaders of jnu...</comment>

<comment>Rather we want to remember:1. Lance Naik Hanamanthappa Koppad2. Sepoy Mushtaq Ahmed3. Subedar Nagesha TT4. Havaldar M Elumalai5. Lance Naik Havaldar S Kumar6. Lance Naik Sudheesh7. Sepoy PN Mahesha8. Sepoy Ganesan9. Sepoy Rama Murthy10. Sepoy nursing assist Suryawanshi</comment>

<comment>this is an awesome replyTake that you sickular therefore anti national motherfuckers</comment>

<comment>neither. One is a over emotional. And other has no shame in waltzing with those JNU jihadis who wish ill to the nation </comment>

<comment>He is NOT a hooligan. He is a patriot.</comment>

<comment>apologies i stand corrected. For a moment i tried to balance my criticism of JNU like sickular media. But i stand corrected</comment>

<comment>calling patriots as Hooligans is the new fad.Even Bhagat Singh and Bose are Hooligans as per these people!</comment>

<comment>What exactly was the difference between Bhagat Singh and Afzal Guru, if both attacked Parliament and justified it. Glorifying those who chose the path of violence is a coin with two sides. One man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist, this is no fad but a fact of life.</comment>

<comment>Moronic.... Bhagath singh was a freedom fighter... got himself arrested.. So that he can have a platform where he could question the british colonial occupation of india... Afzal guru was a terrorist who  was caught after he conspired with enemy state pakistan and orchestrated attack on a democratic elected govt... By the way he also got paid for it and he made a complete confession</comment>

<comment>no difference...so India is and was ruled by democratically elected govts: when both attacks happened..reading a lot of Irfan Habib history...????</comment>

<comment>The point is that both were wrong to choose violence, no matter what their beliefs. Even Gandhiji condemned Bhagat Singh. If we praise one violent chap today, it should be no surprise that others are encouraged tomorrow. Let's condemn all violence and stick to civil debate and constructive criticism.</comment>

<comment>of course not....fighting an enemy of ur country is not violence....high time u strt to distinguish violence</comment>

<comment>Any time we make an argument for fighting an enemy of your country/society/language/religion/group realise that argument is also true for the other side. You cannot glorify your violence and condemn others for it.Violence is violence and must be condemned on all sides for any issue to be resolved meaningfully. Society does not progress with violence.</comment>

<comment>if the argument is true for enemies they shud stage that in their soil not in enemies' soil...preaching is all fine...</comment>

<comment>Neither -- the face of the nation is that of Hanumanthappa Koppad!</comment>

<comment>All ten Soldiers for that matter.</comment>

<comment>These Pseudo intellectulas, liberals et al are trying there best to somehow push back the real cause of the public anger- that is anti national slogals and acts of leftist JNU students. But we must keep vigil and ensure that the root cause is not forgotten lest these fake liberals tomorrow will say that it is ABVP which gave anti-national slogans and Umar Khalid actually prevented them.</comment>

<comment>True...Guys.. These commies and MSM are trying to confuse everyone.. Earlier they tried Hindu muslim Thatbdid not work they tried upper caste lower casteThen they tried anti bjp and anti govtThen they said one mla has beaten up their supporter completely hiding the fact that they were provoked... Just be careful of these free loaders....And don't let the original issue of raising anti India slogan be put on the back burner...Let's keep the debate alive and force them to answer some questions...Jai hind...</comment>

<comment>In a country called India there lived a liberalHating anything Indian was of course naturalDadri killing he described as a gruesome killingAnd Godhra was called a mere accidental burningMurders of some activists he protested loudlyMedals given by anti-sikh rioters he paraded proudlyCleansing of Kashmiri Pandits was never worth a discussionBut killing of a terrorist brought caused them frustrationHanging of Afzal and Yakub was an act of violenceDeaths in Pathankot didn’t even drew condolenceFor him Ishrat Jahan was not a terroristNaturally patriotic Indian was on his hit listAnti-National Slogans at JNU are freedom of ExpressionSinging Vande Mataram drove them to depressionHis dislike of Hindus was very visceralThat’s why he was called a TRUE SECULAR</comment>

<comment>Honestly For a second I thought I was reading detail description or rajsheet sardesai :)</comment>

<comment>Aansu aa gye... Wah..</comment>

<comment>Excellent!</comment>

<comment>Sir,  really a great one.   Thanks.</comment>

<comment>These writers will stoop to any level! Defending an a hole commie...unbelievable!!!</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't like either of the chaps to be the face f the nation. Both are foolish, selfish and brutal. But the sad truth is , both represent core aspects of this diverse and ancient country. Both are indispensable to the character of this civilisation we call India. But India is greater than just these two thugs. </comment>

<comment>Definitely Neither of them.What a disgrace brought over by few extremist & ill-advised students of JNU & Jadavpur on India at a time when whole of the country  should be paying great respects to souls of soldierswho sacrificed  their lives doing the duty at Siachen Glacier for protecting the Country...We should be remembering the names of1. Lance Naik Hanamanthappa Koppad2. Sepoy Mushtaq Ahmed3. Subedar Nagesha TT4. Havaldar M Elumalai5. Lance Naik Havaldar S Kumar6. Lance Naik Sudheesh7. Sepoy PN Mahesha8. Sepoy Ganesan9. Sepoy Rama Murthy10. Sepoy nursing assist SuryawanshiBut the whole country was made to forcefully remember names like1. Umar Khalid2  Kanhaiya Kumar3. Anirban Bhattacharya4. Riazul Haq5. Rubina Saifee6. OP Sharma7. Vikram Chouhan8. Ali Javed9. Jubi Saha10. Raktim Ghosh11.Lenin Kumar12.Shela Rashid Shora</comment>

<comment>thanks bro ,dont care about others but i will try to  remember all above martyrs  a throughout my life</comment>

<comment>For the first time in life,  I see the "Intellectuals" are  SCARED.   Great..</comment>

<comment>ya they are so much scared that they started raising anti national slogan.</comment>

<comment>Neither of the two. India is much better than these two clowns.</comment>

<comment>VIKRAM SINGH CHAUHAN ABAAD HAIN, O.P. SHARMA SAHAB BHAGWAN, SRI RAMACHANDRA KI SAUGAAT HAIN!!!!</comment>

<comment>Kanhaiya hamari awaz hai...Bharat Tere Tukde Honge!!!</comment>

<comment>Yes... Kanhaiya is the Face of India   as Akshaya Mishra / Sandipan / Tarique Anwar   are the Face of Indian Journalism   showing "Honesty, Integrity & Professionalism" !!!Anyway, vultures like you will find the bloated corpse better than anything in this world.</comment>

<comment>Arre ap emotional ho gaye.. Bhaiya.. Ganda hai par dhanda hai. Sorry haan..</comment>

<comment>All this video/audion voice overlapping theory is a ploy by the sickular media to subvert the truth.</comment>

<comment>People should just remember HOW all this started!!!JNU Commies went out and started shouting anti India slogans! Thats how it started and the police had to crack down!!!! They are not some innocent students protesting against some govt policy!!!</comment>

<comment>This Kumar chap was NOT opposing anything the government has done! makingThey were shouting Pro Afzal slogans, Kashmir separatism and anti India slogans!!He can NEVER be the FACE of INDIA!!!!!</comment>

<comment>He is the faeces of India. Looks like it too.</comment>

<comment>This is a stupid  question as Kanhaiya is a Commie and is not interested in the nation and at least  Chouhan is nationalist.We will not have true freedom and democracy if the likes Kanhaiya are there, they dont want to listen to other voices as well.  For eg, they didnt permit Ramdev Baba from entering JNU campus. So who are these guys like Kanhaiya, Gov. must take strick action against such brain washed students.</comment>

<comment>Innocently unaware that 'Bharat tere Tukde Honge' could be seen as sedition!Wow! Kya defense hai! Sickulars are truning out to be worse that common Pakis!!!</comment>

<comment>Kanhaiya has not done anything good...I would have choosen him if he would have opposed the event very moment he was on spot...but he kept silent & let the event run n conclude....Even if he was not involved in anti india sloaganeering....by virtue of being president of JNU students...he indeed give his silent support instead of opposing.....He can not be ideal....at the most people can have sympathy with him only because "police went extreme & put sedition charge on him".....nothing more than that....</comment>

<comment>Where did you get your informatin?  From the paid traitor media?</comment>

<comment>one of these folks here venting as usual was seen surreptitiously winking at a lady in a burkha as well as a hijab....the atmosphere was redolent with honeys and traps.ergo, one of these vile venting vermin should be immediately copped for treasonous activities and then questioned aka third degreed.he won't succumb otherwise.jai ho !</comment>

<comment>Most of this nation s ctizens be it Muslim or Hindus or sikhs are religious we don't want athiest commie ideology</comment>

<comment>the face of the bloke on the potty should be the bearded fellow's while the paper to be used later should have the face of the clean shaven fellers.actually, 'twasn't 'nationalism' nor 'patriotism' that the thug was exhibiting. please !it was arrogant adolescence and half witted hooliganism and an attempt at accruing brownie points from his bloodthirsty baboon like bosses.erm, wonder if this scum of the courts even knows how to spell nationalism or patriotism.btw., these two words signify different thingies, but, leave that for another day.</comment>

<comment>This nation,Hindus have suffered enough from Islamic hegemony we don't want to take any risk in the name of freedom of expression or commie ideology</comment>

<comment>Niether of these are national  heroes to be emulated... So why use one to defend the other...Cant u come up with better argument  for your narrative... Let both of them be held responsible  for respective deeds... Bar council as per the SC initiated action against chauhan... So why such hurry to let kumar go without  being questioned...The point is  people who espouse Bharat ki barbadi... Are indefensible... However much spin doctors keep making specious arguments </comment>

<comment>True kanha Krishna was gou rakshak this commie kanahayya kumar is happy with gou bhakshaks</comment>

<comment>A painter faced sedition case during Congress govt. under Sonia Gandhi...Why comparison with Nazi Germany was not made at that time...</comment>

<comment>Arvind Kejriwal is the true face of the nation.....Burn Bhakts Burn</comment>

<comment>In your dreams..</comment>

<comment>How about neither? Why do you need to present these two as only choices? How about Hanumanthappa ?</comment>

<comment>Iss Kanhiaya ne Kishan bhagwan ka naam hi kharaab kar daala.</comment>

<comment>We do need hyper nationalist patriots to scare the anti-nationals away with their tails between their legs.</comment>

<comment>No Doubt my choice is Vikram Chauhan. He represents the anger of country against these traitors of nation. Ham sab Vikram Chauhan hai</comment>

<comment>Excellent I like and support your sentiments.</comment>

<comment>None.</comment>

<comment>Akshaya Mishra says it is Nazi Germany...well,  Akshaya Mishra, in Nazi Germany, you will get a bullet for writing this article...so do not make this kind of hyperboled comparisons...</comment>

<comment>Yup. Hitler would have had him hung like cattle, in his own words.</comment>

<comment>Vikram Singh Chauhan is a little more pleasant to look at. So will opt for him. :D</comment>

<comment>Absolute BS. The words you have used to glorify Kanhaiya Kumar can also be used for glorifying IM and SIMI cadres - they too take for granted their Indian nationalism and freedom and express themselves. But don't for even a second conclude that I am justifying the Patiala Court lout. As such you have offered a choice most of us will not exercise or vote on. </comment>

<comment>So, did author conclude that Kumar is upholding Gandhi's ideology because he studies in JNU? He is the representation of leftist ideology and more of a upholder of Bose's ideology which Gandhi hates. Authors don't let facts hindrance their juicy theories.</comment>

<comment>He is not an upholder of Bose's ideology either mate !!! he and the organisation he belongs to have long been followers of Mao Tse Tung and have at all points of time in history tried to take india in the paths of Maoism...</comment>

<comment>Guys please educate people about Corp orates like Reliance trying to control India with their Money power....We have to teach them a lesson</comment>

<comment>We just need to look at the poster of the controversial JNU event organized on 9th Feb...Anybody who has a little bit of patriotism will oppose the event...But, Kanhaiya Kumar did not oppose the event...But, of course, JNU opposed the Baba Ramdev event...</comment>

<comment>completely agree, I get so angry when I see these FP articals supporting K Kumar after all what he has done</comment>

<comment>None. Both faces are as filthy as Akshay Sharma's pen</comment>

<comment>Why if FP trying to sell us kanihya so desparately?? have you noticed their last 20 articles. They trying hard to make us love him.</comment>

<comment>Hang them all together. Free the country of DESH DROUIS.</comment>

<comment>Useless efforts.  But can't blame these intellectuals ... they always  do the right thing  after everything else has been tried & proved futile.Like Leftist agreeing that   1947 slogan "Yeh Azadi jhoota ha"  was wrong in 1970s ... Jyoti Basu saying "Himalayan Blunder"  some years after the event had taken place.If one can understand things and can express that in simple terms, then he is not an intellectual.</comment>

<comment>yes that is what I am surprised....These people are trying to push bad name on Indian Govt so that they can get their gas prices corrected if Congress comes to power in next election..  The worst think is they are even ready to stab Mother India in this process</comment>

<comment>sandipan flap around while watching his photos</comment>

<comment>Guys we have to see the problem from root.....There are people funding terror inside India....Intelligence have to wake up put the facts out.</comment>

<comment>How do you know that Vikram Chauhan belongs to RSS...Is RSS saying that?...</comment>

<comment>They are using the JNU lingo .... if someone is Not  Leftists ... then he/she is from RSS / BJP.</comment>

<comment>ITS  the great pseudoliberal fear that makes every person rss if they doesnt love muslim/anti national appeasers</comment>

<comment>People like Ambani think they can manage everything if they have money...Guys if people revolt u are nothing but ashes</comment>

<comment>Vikram Singh Chauhan is a sanghi lumpen, like Maya Kodnani.</comment>

<comment>FirstPost is funded by Bigger Ambani</comment>

<comment>THIS IS AMBANI'S FORUM TO BLACKMAIL GOVT</comment>

<comment>nerds?</comment>

<comment>probably</comment>

<comment>We have made our choices and our nationalism will not give either Kanhaiyaa Kumar the opportunity to collude with anti-national forces to denigrate India nor Vikram Chouhan the authority to beat up people just like that...We are going to expose the middleman and liberal self declared intelligentsia and media houses who try to create a counter narrative to extremely seditious environment nurtured by a section of JNU teachers who shit on the plate they eat from....</comment>

<comment>Well said. </comment>

<comment>none and by the way who are you to conduct such a survey and divide the society</comment>

<comment>WE ARE PROTECTOR OF INDIA ,THE PSEUDO LIBERAL MEDIA</comment>

<comment>What is Firstpost Articals upto?? are u Mad.Why support K Kumar, yes he may be fellow Indian....but we all saw what he did at JNUFirstpost posts are going crazy...Days are near People will teach you and your funders Ambani a lesson</comment>

<comment>The real issue is not Kumar but "India ki barbadi". When the "secular free speech" journalists realised the whole country turned against them, they focused on Kumar, as though he is the issue.</comment>

<comment>For last few days, a series of such articles are trying to make people feel sympathy for Kumar and JNU.The common theme in these is calling everyone who wants to feel disgusted by the slogans a goon, killer of Gandhi and so on.In the guise of Kumar, they are basically calling everyone who felt revolted by the slogans stupid for having felt what they felt.Wonder if they realize that they are basically saying "if you found the slogans revolting, you should vote for BJP. Because everyone else is going to sympathize with the slogan." You authors are just making BJP very happy.</comment>

<comment>Why should we have only these 2 lousy options, Mishraji ? It is like choosing to read either you or R@ndipan - both unacceptable to a vast majority ! India is not so handicapped and short of options !</comment>

<comment>Vikram Chauhan of course. A man who earns his livelihood and not lives on government doles. Pays taxes which feed freeloaders like Kanhaiya kumar. And a man who is ready to take on anyone who insults his motherland. Where is the confusion?</comment>

<comment>LOL. Vikram is a loser of an advocate. His only source of income are the perks of shady dealings that come with being involved in the politics in bar council.</comment>

<comment>Very good comment these free loaders  like Kanhya are the namak harams of the first order.</comment>

<comment>agreed</comment>

<comment>HA HA HA HA</comment>

<comment>One is Stalin, other is Hitler. :)</comment>

<comment>dont lay mud on great leaders according to western stereotyping ,neither u nor i are dust in nails comparison to them,and though they caused so much trouble but they were true patriots unlike mr kanahiya</comment>

<comment>In a historic judgement justice deepak chaurasiya found kanhaiya guilty of sedition and In another historic judgement justice umar khalid found guru innocent. people found these judgements more accurate than our regular court judgements...</comment>

<comment>Thanks Akshaya for appointing Vikram Chauhan as a sanghi/ RSS and painting the whole organisation in one single sweep !!you commies have been doing this for a very long time. Too bad for you, educated ppl of India wouldnt fall for these generalisations any more.I dont know if Kanhaiya is wrong or right, its for the courts to decide now. I dont even know if Vikram is right or wrong (Bar council is looking into his conduct), but i know one thing, you commies know how to trivilaise all matters that hurt your ideologies, but this time India wouldnt let the main issue be trivilised by some non-events unrelated to the main question hog the lime light...</comment>

<comment>Guys Google Ebiz fraudsthese people conduct seminars in the name of part time jobs and ask people to sell a CD with some crap educational videos to people for 11000Rs telling that actually that CD is worth over 3 lakh Rs content, and many people had fallen prey to it,and they say the seller will get 3000Rs if he sell 2 CDs...and they all run it saying we are into Skill india and helping government in universal Education, its run by some pawan malhan, please beware and spread the word.....</comment>

<comment>vikram chauhan by his loutish behavior has allowed anti national commiees and traitors from jnu to escape scrutiny of the nation a lot of ugly filth from jnu would have also come out if this useless delhi lawyers had not hijacked the commiee jnu episode   these lawyers have let down arnab goswami of times now  who was the first to expose the jnu traitors</comment>

<comment>Yes,  Vikram Chauhan has unwittingly given an escape route.   But the other consequence is -   These Adarsh Liberals are now SCARED  for the first time.</comment>

<comment>'The country has to make a choice between Vikram Chauhan and Kanhaiya Kumar' . This is so funny. Author trying so hard to make a hero out of Kanhaiya by pitching him against Vikram Chauhan. Country needs to choose none out of the two.</comment>

<comment>Definitely Chauhan ! Do you have any doubts , my dear author !!!</comment>

<comment>Saving Kanahiya and his fellow friends is like saving a rapist saying that girl wear a sexy dress!</comment>

<comment>Between the two, Vikram Chauhan..At least he does not, wittingly or unwittingly, help people to ask for dismemberment of India.</comment>

<comment>Azadi from PhD in subjects like history, anthropology, sociology etc. etc. non technical subjects... which does not contribute in the development of India,....There is distance of only one road between JNU & IIT Delhi... but a lot of diiference in level of study and contribution in India's development.... In JNU, students do everything, like freedom speech like a hardcore politician, revolution, protest march etc., except studies..........</comment>

<comment>Guess when it comes to FP's idea of India, and yours - objectivity be damned, nationalism be damned, and constitution be damned, in that order..But to take at face value this moronic op-ed you'd just posted, we and by that most of us would definitely prefer Vijay Chauan as the face of India for being the lesser of two evils..for with Chauan, the idea of the union of India, security, constitution, and not to mention the various checks and balances are ensured - the last ironically by the excess of chauanesque incidents.Where as with parasites like Kanhiya, under the garb of freedom, the national security is threatened.and incidentally, you do not require an invading force to threaten the nation - just an idea, an concept as the one you aired is enough. Sedition is a serious charge and more to the point, as framed by our parlimentariams, is one that Kahniya is guilty of, by all counts. To this end, he will face the music as the proof against this anti national rhetoric is presented before the courts. Nice try but no dice..</comment>

<comment>All these people who are defending the events at jnu would not present the same arguments in court... Let them make the same statements in the court as the slogans that have been raised at jnu.. Would they be able to defend themselves at that point.... These people dare to defend such statements only outside  court</comment>

<comment>in your trial kanhaiya is guilty and in omar khalid's trial guru was innocent. do we still need courts?</comment>

<comment>In my opinion, they should be hanged and quartered..but Unfortunately I am not the emperor of India or as Kejriwal likes it..that being said, all anti national sentiments deserve to be crushed under the boot, no exceptions..period.</comment>

<comment>INDEED.</comment>

<comment>Media is playing the Pimp role or the R@ndi?? Please vote</comment>

<comment>just saw eye opener ravish kumar show about today's debates and journalists. the media trials should stop and people should wait for the truth to come out before making their opinion about anyone.the answer to the question above would be none of these.People like Arnab Goswami should be ashamed of their style of questioning. He does not let anyone speak and its really irritating to listen to the debates he conducts. He may think he is very talented and people love to listen to his debates. but if you check the comments on youtube about his shows the reality is totally different.The job of a journalist is to ask tough questions and let the other party explain his stand clearly.</comment>

<comment>Irrelevant Comment.</comment>

<comment>India map shown in the pole does not show POK and Aksai kashmir as part of india. What kind of anti national activities FP is up to?</comment>
