<comment>Khalistan .... LOL!!! Who would want to be a citizen of a country with such a ghastly name</comment>

<comment>How I wish keepers of our Hindu temples learnt to keep the place clean like the Sikhs. How I wish the pandits in the temple were more devoted to God and less to money. My personal experience of even well-known temples in Kolkata, in Haridwar and other places is that the pandas are out to fleece people. It is so bad that we Hindus donate gold, silver and  cash to the already rich temples, but will haggle with a street-side vendor while buying small things.</comment>

<comment>Sikhs Gurdwara, the most welcome place in India! One must be careful when entering a Hindu Temple!Sorry no offense but it's true! It is a pleasure to see the Sikhs with turbans all over the world! "Our love for God is demonstrated primarily by our love for our fellowmen"!Sikhs can be a blessing to India,like in Canada!</comment>

<comment>Congress is the one who plays the tricks but the traitors of Sarbat Khalsa will face the same baton in Congress rule too. Sabat Khalsa should go to west Punjab for their Khalistan. In India they will find just Punjab.</comment>

<comment>Sikh are the most respected community in India for their sacrifice and participation in nation building.  Few NRI supported by ISI are creating trouble for the whole community and the country.  Most of these NRIs  escaped Pakistan to save themselves from ethnic cleansing during partition.</comment>

<comment>Peace must prevail in India. Sikhs and Hindus are brothers and will always remain so. those who are trying to divide the two community will never succed</comment>

<comment>The Sikhs have seen what 68 years of being in India have given them. Tens of thousands of Sikh deaths by the hands of the Indian military, destruction of Akal Takht and the state now in the grips of a drugs epidemic. A whole generation of Sikh youth murdered and people still think that the Sikhs want to stay in India. It is time for the Sikhs to create their own country and not to live as slaves in India.</comment>

<comment>All the reason you are talking, the good thing move to west Punjab, you still have Lahore as your capital go for it.</comment>

<comment>You seem to be one of that NRI types, screaming about Sikh victimization in India. Wake up, India is a lot kinder than what people like you paint it to be. There have been serious aberrations in the past though.</comment>

<comment>I am sure sanity will prevail in Punjab. It will be a tragedy to see this beautiful state and its merry people again suffer what it already did many decades ago. Bad governance and lack of statesmanship have resulted in the restlessness among our brothers and sisters there. But with a high level of education and the average family better off in comparison with those from other states, I hope people will relent and leave aside the idea of leaving the Indian union. Peace to all.</comment>
