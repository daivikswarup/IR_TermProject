<comment>Good. It is a clear war between Modi/Jaitley and the Sangh. By destroying the fascist, regressive Sangh, Modi will do at least one good thing in the larger interest of the country.1. The moment Lalit Modi named Jaitley, Lalitgate went cold, as Jaitley used his contacts in the Media to jump on Vyaapam.2. Modi used this opportunity to remove the Sangh's last mass leader against him: Shivraj Singh Chauhan3. Now the Sangh will be trimmed down to size using the CBI and Vyaapam. One less headache to deal with.Win-Win for Non-Bhakts !!</comment>

<comment>well according to rss science and others like them, homosexuality is a mental/genetic disorder and a filth from west, but what is involvement in vyapam scam? i guess it is core value of indian culture and a sane state of mind na dmoral valuesand what is most shameful is even though congress ministers were involved in many scams including 2g, the biggest in indian history (till now) but at least nobody got killed when those scams were exposed. at least congress has some shame.</comment>

<comment>RSS aka saffron terrorists have no morals just like other political outfits, of course bhakts will swear by them because they get drilled every night by the same thugs every night at Gayshakha...</comment>

<comment>sangis are Chors.</comment>

<comment>RSS will liken Politics to prostitution for public consumption, but will always meddle with it.  This shows their hypocrisy of the worst kind ? RSS cannot leave politics because without politics they cannot make the kind of money they are now making through such scams !!  If you question them for this loot, you will be asked to pack your bags and leave for Pakistan or Afghanistan !!</comment>

<comment>BRING INDIAN SPRING  ........ONE SINGLE MOBILE PHONE IN ONE HOUSE CAN CHANGE A COUNTRY.  India only has 150 million internet connections in a country of 1.3 billion people. Know what? The Congress wants to keep it that way. If more of us had internet connections, the whole country could show how angry people are. There will be a ground swell and there will be an Indian Spring. It is time for Indian spring. Indian people have start making a change with the tools available today. Start voicing your opinion. HARASSING Indian government cannot control 1.30 billion people. A handful of Indian political dynasties and other scum bags cannot control 1.3 people of India any more</comment>

<comment>Looking at whats happening these days, I think the Indian spring, if any, will be against BJP rule</comment>

<comment>CRIMINAL RAPIST BJP MINISTER NIHAL CHAND IN A RAPE CASE................A rape complaint filed some time back has returned to haunt Union minister of state Nihal Chand, the lone MP from Rajasthan to get a berth in Narendra Modi's council of ministers.   a 20-year-old woman at the metropolitan magistrate's court (11) who accused her husband and his friends of sexually exploiting her. The court has asked all 17 of them to appear in a court. The woman in her petition said she belongs to Abubsher in Sirsa district in Haryana and was married to one Om Prakash of Hanumangarh district on December 20, 2010. The alleged victim has accused the Union minister for trying to intimidate her into withdrawing the case and has also appealed to PM for justice. She said, "Since I was threatened, I have been really scared. I was offered monetary compensation and a job if I withdrew the case." THIS IS THE FEKU MODI’S CRIMINAL CABINET OF MINISTERS. Criminals in Guajart like Babulal Bokharia, Purushottam Solnaki, Amit Shah and criminals again in New Delhi on a public dime looting the nation.</comment>

<comment>FAKE DEGREES OF BJP’S CORRUPT MINISTER VINOD TAWDE................Maharashtra Education Minister Vinod Tawde caused major embarrassment to the government Monday after it came to light that he received an engineering degree from a university that is not recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC) or the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). The disclosure came after a Marathi news channel flashed reports about it Monday morning. Tawde is a senior cabinet rank minister who is charting out new education policies for school and higher education. BJP’s uneducated education minister Smriti Irani lying about education under oath 3 times, Fake degrees of BJP's corrupt ministers Lonikar and Ram Shankar Karatia are burning examples of corrupt, lying and immoral BJP that will driving India further into the ground.  This is why India commands no respect in the world. Like leader, like people of India.</comment>

<comment>FAKE DEGREES OF BJP’S CORRUPT MINISTER RAM SHANKAR KATHERIA................BJP’s corrupt and lying minister Ram Shankar Katheria has been charged with forging two of his degree mark-sheets (for B. A. and M. A.) allegedly to secure a job at the Agra University. The case is being heard in a court. Katheria has also listed 20 other pending cases against him in his election affidavit. Also, in a condemnable incident, a child was found working at a press conference called by Junior Human Resource and Development (HRD) minister Ram Shankar Katheria at his house in Agra. At a Press Conference in Agra held by a junior minister of Modi government, Ram Shankar Katheria, a 12-year-old was found serving snacks. The child was spotted working at the minister’s home where the Conference was held. When the boy was asked if he worked at the Minister’s house, he nodded and agreed that he was 12 years old. When asked about the child labour Katheria denied and casually said, “Kahan shram hai? Ghar ka bacha hai (He is from the family)”.  However his spokesperson said that the child was a party worker’s son.  It is shocking that people who make laws are breaking it shamelessly. THIS IS THE FEKU MODI’S CRIMINAL CABINET OF MINISTERS. Criminals in Guajart like Babulal Bokharia, Purushottam Solnaki, Amit Shah and criminals again in New Delhi on a public dime looting the nation.</comment>

<comment>FAKE DEGREES OF BJP’S MAHARSHTRA MINISTER BABANRAO LONIKAR................BJP’s Maharashtra Water Supply Minister Babanrao Lonikar had claimed in the election affidavits in 2004 and 2009 that he had done the first year of Bachelor of Arts course. However, his 2014 affidavit says he has studied only up to class V.  Corrupt and liar Lonikar mentioned his qualification in his affidavits of 2004 and 2009  as FYBA from Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University (YCMOU) in 1991. However, in 2014 election affidavit, he mentioned he has completed his education till Standard 5 from Zilla Parishad School at Loni (Khurd) in Partur Tehsil of Parbhani district in 1973. There is another document in which Mr. Lonikar’s education qualification is stated as ‘BA’. It seems that liar and forger Lonikar studied backwards, first BA and then back to high school.  BJP’s Narendra Modi lying about his marriage on election affidavits for 24 years, BJP’s uneducated education minister Smriti Irani lying about education under oath 3 times are examples of corrupt, lying and immoral BJP that will driving India further into the ground.  This is why India commands no respect in the world. Like leader, like people of India.</comment>

<comment>AAP WILL PROSECUTE AND THROW CONGRESS AND BJP CRIMINALS IN JAIL  ........AAP will arrest and prosecute you for corruption and crimes against Indian people. Indian people will not stop.  No more corruption, no more staying in power for 30, 40, 50 years like Bhagoda husband Modi, Pranab Mukerjee, Sharad Pawar, Karundanidhi, Chidmbaram, Kalamdi, A R aja, Kanimozi, Bokharia, Solanki, Kodnani, Amit Shah etc., No more installing stupid children in power like slow brain Rahul Gandhi, Supriya Sule, Omar Abdulla, Sachin Pilot, Milind Deora, Dushyant Singh, Digvijay's Son, Yeddyruppa’s sons etc., no more nation looting like Suresh Kalamadi, Yedyyuruppa, A. Raja, Kanimozi, Sharad Pawar, Bokharia, Solanki, Amit Shah and others.  Congress and BJP are the same... Corrupt, dynastic, criminal, nepotistic nation looters.</comment>

<comment>INDIA'S SHAME - BJP'S UNEDUCATED EDUCATION MINISTER SMIRIT IRANI................In 2004 Smriti Irani submitted an affidavit claiming a Bachelor’s degree in Arts in 1996 from Delhi University’s school of correspondence. But in 2014, Irani submitted another affidavit saying she had completed just the first year of her degree course. Such is the confusion about the HRD minister’s academic background that nobody knows if she is a graduate, a Yale scholar or somebody who couldn't pursue education beyond school. Yet, Irani continues to strut around as a symbol of BJP’s shuchita and sanskriti. The uneducated education minister lying liar Smriti Irani, the HRD minister of the country gets away by jazzing up her own dossier, obfuscating her educational qualifications by submitting self-incriminating conflicting affidavits. She must be arrested immediately and taken to a police station frog walking in front of Indian people. BJP’s Narendra Modi lying about his marriage on election affidavits for 24 years, lousy BJP’s ministers Babanrao Lonikar, Vnod Tawde and Ram shankar Katharia lying about education under oath are examples of corrupt, lying and immoral BJP that will driving India further into the ground.  This is why India commands no respect in the world. Like leader, like people of India.</comment>

<comment>A PUZZLE FOR BJP CHUMACHAS----------A corrupt BJP minister appointed by none other than FEKU and wife deserter Modi has faked his degrees. His is from Agra constituency in Uttar Pradesh and lied about his education. Can you guess who this corrupt, lying liar and criminal minister is?  HINT.... He has 2 God's names in his name... RAM AND SHANKAR. Can you guess now?</comment>

<comment>TODAY'S RIDDLE----------BJP's has appointed a fat, heavy, lying liar and uneducated woman as our great nation's education minister. She is only 12th pass and has repeatedly lied about her education. Sometimes she said she is a law graduate, sometimes she says she is a BA. She did not stop there. One time she said she has a degree from Yale University in the United States of America. Fake degrees, fake leaders and fake promises of clean politics by feku Modi and his cronies. Guess who that lying liar dumb MOTI is?    HINT.... SHE IS NEVER ELECTED AND HAS LOST ALL ELECTIONS.</comment>

<comment>BJP Chumacho....... You cannot put lipstick on the pig called Napunsak Modi (NaMo) any more because Indian people are finding out that this phony emperor has no clothes.</comment>

<comment>What happened to toilets in every home that napusak Modi promised before elections? Why has he decided to sh*it on them instead with scams and nation looting?</comment>

<comment>What happened to Rs. 15 lakhs Modi was going to give to each Indian from the black money within 100 days? Is the black money stuck in Modi's black hole ??</comment>

<comment>MODI CANNOT TAKE CARE OF HIS WIFE. HOW CAN HE TAKE CARE OF YOU?.........We know that Narendra Modi abandoned his wife Jashodaben since their marriage when she was just 18. Darpok and napunsak Modi ran away because his tool does not work. Modi chumachas have been hiding this truth for 40 years. Jasodaben is a school teacher and is languishing in Rajosana village of Banaskantha district. She had studied up to class VIII. Jashodaben does not like to be photographed and she is conscious of Modi’s position although she is hopeful that someday Modi will come to her and publicly accept her as his wife. If this is what Modi can do to his own wife and hide the truth...... HOW WILL HE TAKE CARE OF YOU?</comment>

<comment>THIS NAPUNSAK MODI WILL PUT INDIA INTO A COMA-------------------FEKU MODI realised 14 months gone now but he cannot figure this out:1. How is the corruption free India now?2. Robert Vadra is in which jail?3. Whether Rahul/Sonia are in jail or escaped to Italy?4. I need to go Lucknow, Whether bullet train is cheap or flight is cheap?5. How much money returned from Swiss banks?6. After receiving 15 lakhs all the poverty will be eradicated from India. Is it so?7. Is 1 USD = Rs. 35 now?8. Whether indians are happy with lower prices of Petrol, Diesel, Gas, tomato, onion, potato now?9. What happened to Dawood Ibrahim, after the terrified Pak has sent him to India?10. Whether the farmers are happy now after feku returned the land grabbed by Congress to them?</comment>

<comment>SCAM INDIA YESTERDAY.... SCAM INDIA TODAY..............India is the only country where you are literate if you can just write your name.  in MP's Vyapam scam CM's secretary's daughter scored 85% and got into a medical school but answered only 15% questions in the Exam. This doctor will operate on Indian patients. No wonder 75% of engineers from India are unemployable but atleast parents have paid and can call him an engineer and can recover in dowery. We thought BJP and a pig with lipstick called Modi wanted to end corruption but even there are members of cabinet who have lied about their background and even SC warned him but Judges being impotent could not do anything. Like the UPA we are seeing new scams every day in BJP. What we forget is that we are all chips of the same block and can blame others. WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO WILL THROW ALL THESE SCUM BAGS IN JAIL.</comment>

<comment>There is little doubt that RSS members have been beneficiaries of the scam. BJP shoushould cut its losses by taking corrective action immediately. Action should be taken against those found guilty in a free and swift probe. NO useful purpose will be served by pretending that everything is all right. It is in the party's interest to be upfront on this matter.</comment>
