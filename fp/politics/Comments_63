<comment>Wow! This is what journalism has come down to. Bashing Kher for not being eligible to get visa. First the author puts words in Anupam Kher's mouth. Anupam Kher never said that he got denied visa for supporting BJP or Modi. I guess, somewhere author's conscience got hurt when Shashi Tharoor was called Congi Chamcha. May be he identified too closely with the term.Second, how can you justify Pak denying visa to Anupam Kher simply because he expressed views in India against Indian issues.Sandipan Sharma - you've lost it. I don't think you have an iota of journalistic ethics left in you. Your mercantilistic tendencies are visible in the title, tone and content of the article which is directed to flame a certain passion and get readership.</comment>

<comment>There is a concept of zero sum game in economics... Anupam and Kapil both were trying to use it to get fame and got defame from the other side. They both behaved as immatures. Those who arise win win situation are mature people. Mature in one field doesn't mean that he becomes mature in every field...</comment>

<comment>What a senseless article !!</comment>

<comment>Only to bhakts</comment>

<comment>I do not support Modi and he looks like a waste more and more as time passes. This article is just an ill-written piece of bs. But the way you are going about replying on everyone's comments calling names tells a lot about how bankrupt you are mentally.</comment>

<comment>The author is obviously on the payrolls of the Congress Government and Terrorists from across the border. Otherwise it is impossible to understand the level of vitriolic one would spew against an individual.Maybe the government should check Sandipan's movements and his bank accounts and other details. It would be interesting to see him getting money from Terrorists and anti-national.The author is worse than the worst cancer that afflicts nations. I wonder if the Americans can take him to Guantanamo Bay. I am sure he would fit in just fine there.</comment>

<comment>Why don't you share your real name and details so that we can find out who is paying you and which country will accommodate a bhakt like you now that even nepal is sickular. Want visa to Pakistan bhakt? </comment>

<comment>The author should undergo treatment for his mental state. Someone sick with hatred mouthing inanities should not be allowed the indulgence of his publishing his rant in a media platform. He deserves sympathy & help not a mouthpiece.</comment>

<comment>Explain Padma to chamcha first </comment>

<comment>It amuses us to shock that how can an anti-Indian in-Acting Anupam Kher was not allowed to enter in Pakistan.Kher, A sycophant to Prime molester Modi, An emerging anti-social element who coined the term Intolerant India first time in the history of last 4.5 Billion years,  An Opportunistic Hindu who misuses Hinduism and expresses “scare” for calling himself a Hindu, instead of representing an Indian, is not welcome in Pakistan?</comment>

<comment>Dear Sandipan, Your article is complete nonsense. Tell us how much money our enemy paid to you to write this cheap article.</comment>

<comment>Dear Sandipan .. I just read your well crafted intolerance against one of our respected Padmabhusan Indian and more than that famous Artist .. You are justifying to raise issues which is not suitable for our enemy country and there supporter like U .. It is completely correct not to support paqkistani player to invite india in IPL.. Why u justifying to bring them here.. Absolutly correct being kashmiri hindu..and they are tortured killed murdered and become Migrant in his own country and people like U where r u ? peopl must come out identify like u inteolernt people and supporter of terrorist and traitor ..</comment>

<comment>Padma is equivalent of knighthood ........was he expecting Pakistan consulate bow their heads and welcome Sir Kheer ....guess he got served dumb aloo biryani !!  ...LOL</comment>

<comment>Manish Tiwari's reaction is highly irresponsible.</comment>

<comment>Why this auther behaving like band Baja barati. only one mission do not the complete details but starting bangda on topic. how to you feel when one organizer want you to come to their event and their gov denying it, Anupam ji did not ask for visa. They call him in that event. So it means that need to call this article writer as one of the guest and them denying entry. It is stupidity suppose to say positive to actor but this person look like Arvind kejiriwal, without knowing the reason writing anything.  Recommend to take boost</comment>

<comment>The author seems like a Congi pimp.</comment>

<comment>Seriously the writer is supporting Pakistan. I am really pissed </comment>

<comment>Perhaps the main reason he wasnt given a visa by Pakistan is because they perhaps do not recognise him as a""writer"" or literary person but a political person. Maybe at the SAARC conference Modi can take him rightly as part of his delegation. His other quaklification as a kashmiri pandit is no longer valid as he  has .settled in Mumbai for decades in his profession where he is good as a n actor though there are many more deserving than him to get the Padma honour.and his wife has stood from Punjab and not J&K.. He has managed to get attention today only as a faithful BJP worker for which he has been rewarded.</comment>

<comment>So they want Anupam Kher to dance to the tune of Pakis and make them happy ? Why Pakistan did not say this reason then. We have Indians who are ready to surpass Pakistan in criticizing Indians.</comment>

<comment>For those asssholes who were talking about equality and misogyny during that Shani temple issue.. some detailed reason which media mind telling u.ishadotsadhgurudotorg/blog/sadhguru/spot/shani-shingnapur-controversy-discrimination-or-discretion/</comment>

<comment>Wow these pressti's are taking side of Pakistan :)</comment>

<comment>Presst!.  Once the money started not flowing from Congie account, you started acting as if you are a neutral person. Now as the money flow is restarted, you are back to your usual self.</comment>

<comment>Anupam Kher should be rechristened Anu-Bum Kher since, he is a potential Atom Bomb on a short fuse who can not decide a Friend from a Foe and whose only purpose is to spread intolerance, hatred, jumlas/lies, etc. So may god forgive this scoundrel because he does not know what he is doing.</comment>

<comment>mind explaining how he is spread intolerance, hatred, jumlas/lies and why he need to rechristened to tht religion of piss..</comment>

<comment>Anupam Kher has been behaving like a Modi fanboy.</comment>

<comment>Anupam Kher, baap of trollsApplies for Pak visaGets rejectedGets Pak to apologize & welcome himDoesn't go to Pakistan..hehe haha hahahahahahahahahahaahahahaha</comment>

<comment>According to Pakistan High Commission, he did not apply for a visa. Hence granting or rejecting the visa does not arise. What is the truth, I do not know.Primarily, over the course of time, he is just tying himself into knots.</comment>

<comment>Pls see this video.. none of d 18 ppl applied, they all needed 2 wait for the clearance from pakistan before applying.. all 17 except Kher got the clearance.twitterdotcom/TimesNow/status/694562695937335298</comment>

<comment>OK.The general point - any person with dignity and self-respect would have taken this into his/her stride and kept quiet. There was no need to make a song and dance about it. </comment>

<comment>if he would hv kept quiet how would hv we knew about the hypocrates and payrollee of isi in indian liberals.. gone time of keeping quiet.. ppl should kno d reason..</comment>

<comment>What a balderdash. "People In India on the payroll of ISI among Indian liberals".  Provide "evidence", plus why don't you give this evidence to the authorities to take against these people?</comment>

<comment>check for Tufail Ahmed articles on this.. we have ppl in media who are really on isi payroll.. ppl in media and congress is infested with such ppl..</comment>

<comment>Did he even apply for visa or just said he will visit when someone requested?</comment>

<comment>Anupam Kher, baap of trollsApplies for Pak visaGets rejectedGets Pak to apologize & welcome himDoesn't go to Pakistan..hehe haha hahahahahahahahahahaahahahah</comment>

<comment>Both Modi and Anupam kher and actually any one who has self respect should not go to pakistan and apply for any VISA. Have some self respect guys. Do we really need any friendship with Pakistsan. Anyway we are spending lots of money on our borders with Pakistan.</comment>

<comment>he didnt go na..</comment>

<comment>opportunistic, hypocrite, sycophant, arrogant not to mention the suddenly awoken after 30 years (fake) kashmiri pandit, this moron deserves all the humiliation he can get.</comment>
