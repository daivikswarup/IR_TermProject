<comment>During the 2011  assembly poll campaign Rahul said that if the LDF was voted back to power, Kerala would have a 93-year-old CM at the end of five years. VS retaliated by calling Rahul an 'Amul Baby' and sang a poem by TS Thirumumpu "A grey head is not a sign of ageing, neither is lack of grey a sign of youth. The refusal to bow my head before tyranny is the sign of my youth". VS is hale and healthy now and if politics are favourable then he is fit to become the next CM of Kerala and rule for another five years. Then Kerala would have a 98-year-old CM at the end of five years</comment>

<comment>After 2014 Elections PM MODI has been advised to travel only by Air because of health reasons....he cannot manage to meet people staying on land....Its not his fault....</comment>

<comment>Rahul Said - "I am happy that Chief Minister Oommen Chandy has delivered many of the things he promised," So looks like Oommen delivered the cash (money) he had promised to maa-beta. so Rahul is happy with him :-G</comment>

<comment>I thought Rahul was referring to "women" that Chandy delivered him.</comment>

<comment>why need politicians take photos with farmers , laborer etc...  just do policy n budget for people... let the parliament function..rahul, u worthless piece of shitt , uneducated buffoon...</comment>

<comment>This idiot should explain even after 60  year of this thugs family rule why farmers and laborers still in poor condition.</comment>

<comment>Not sure why Congress  is family  business  of papu & co ?</comment>

<comment>It is high time HE becomes TOLERANT to PM otherwise people will become INTOLERANT towards his party</comment>

<comment>Comedy Piece Pappu restart his Show</comment>

<comment>Brilliant speech by Rahul. After this speech, every farmer and laborer is going to vote for congress party. Rahul should demand dissolution of present parliament and seek immediate elections to LakSabha,before farmers and laborers forget his speech. Kya future PM chunahai, congress partyne ?Kamalki cheeze hai, yeh Pappu</comment>

<comment>Gandhi topis are creating one holy cow after another, one communalism after another[farmers, labourers etc]. Why CANT Rahul Gandhi speak of ALL Indians and INDIAS development.Moral relativism IS moral suicide. The essence is stateism of Mixed economy. For example the president of India as head of state has to commit suicide as merit, an Individual right, is murdered by reservation policy. The state is duty bound to protect Individual from mob rule[India is a ocholocracy(mob rule), and in Ocholocracy Individual rights like merit are murdered by DEFINITION].Such arguments are not answered but ignored -- what the state does is right. Nazism was stateism like socialism. Those who could obtain power could justify state-sponsored murder and plunder by pointing out that since morals don't really exist and are merely a product of one's class or upbringing, there is no moral argument against the state version of murder and plunder.</comment>

<comment>That's correct - Modi is a rich man's PM.  He has no time for minorities and poor. Wish we had a PM who cared for all.</comment>

<comment>Hahahaha  did you  got attention  in past no ? Mental  beggar  don't  deserve  it  got it ? Be beggar  for life or work hard beggar </comment>

<comment>Hope Pappu campaigns in more and more states. After all he's our greatest hope for achieving 'Congress mukt Bharat'.</comment>

<comment>Rofl cant agree more</comment>

<comment>Neither will Namo be mama's baby,little Pappu.</comment>

<comment>Just as you cannot see Modi getting into the Huts of poor villagers and eat away the meagre food they have so that the accompanying Photographers can shoot that picture to show how poor-friendly he is like Rahul Baba.</comment>

<comment>Modiji is anti dalit wants to stop reservation. He is anti reservation. Although he will never admit but mohan bhagwat spoke his mind before bihar polls.</comment>

<comment>Why you  need  reservation  ? After  65 years why you  couldn't  prove  your  self ? How  much mmore  reservation  you  want ? It's  65%  right  now  useless  beggars  don't  deserve  any mercy  khujli  dog go begging  thats what  you  born for shameless  beggars. </comment>

<comment>First d rich sc st bc should b banned from taking reservation benefits.....or put reservations on basis of economically backward quota....poverty knows no caste.</comment>

<comment>First the creamy layer should stop taking away all the benefits of reservation, In India only 20% of SC/ST get all benefits again and again, while 80% never get to see the benefits of reservation. My friend who is SC, has his own house in Bangalore, in fact bunglow, but still takes the benefit of reservation thus preventing the people who need it actually.</comment>

<comment>Mohan Bhagwat said that analysis of benefits going to real people must be done.It is propoganda of opposition to twist the quote.</comment>

<comment>Where was BJP irrational and immoral in Bihar elections? Less said of murderers of merit and criminals of opposition the better. Irrational and Immoral countries die - which is why I say India is already conquered by ISIS and ISI because of reservation policy1)Appeasement to thugs of pro-reservation, by saying "BJP is for not for scrapping reservation policy" is thoroughly immoral. Casteism is also communalism . Modi committed SUICIDE when he said it and the psychological space was left vacant with contest was between Laloo and Nitish. Why would Yadavs choose Modi when they have their own caste leader in Laloo?Lesson: Election results are entirely unpredictable and depends on whims and fancies of electorate. The master election strategy is - be moral. Even if you lose the elections openly say people are immoral. Dont make "people" into holy cows as socialists will like you to do.2)Begging of votes by Modi by reservation appeasement and begging for investments from foreign nations does not pay. Investors come to get profit and wont drop even a single coin into begging bowl of Modi3)Modi should have defined tolerance as tolerance to inequality - with the bold moral strength of people to say "Let better man win". Believe me people value morality and not just base instincts.======================================Now BJP/RSS should bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit</comment>

<comment>You are too harsh on Pappu !</comment>

<comment>I am kind to him by suggesting him how to avoid future embarrassment ;-)</comment>

<comment>Is Pappu wearing boots?</comment>

<comment>You will never see, Narendra Modi admitting that he was responsible for the Godhra Attacks and he celebrated the death of all victims in the Godhra attacksyou will never see Narendra Modi admitting that his Rashtra Dharma and Hindutva prompted him to carry out Godhra Attacks.Pappu and Modi  are two sides of the same coin.</comment>

<comment>Bogan  what do you  know  about  godhra ? Did any of your  kin set alight  ? Barking  is easy  what do you  expect  from  CM holding  gun go to street  ? No secular  liars ever talk about  kashmiri  pandits  shameless  liars. </comment>

<comment>We do not know about Godhra, you are right, We want to know what is right, We will never come to know, We will never be told.We dont know whether Salman Khan was Driving the Car or Not?We dont know if PM Narendra Modi is Pakistani or Indian.So if our Kin is Safe , the all is fine, let someone else's kin die and no need to give explanation , You are arguing, You think just like CM , he is alive, everything is fine.</comment>

<comment>Rather  than  bluffing  first  learn  what is SIT bogan</comment>

<comment>Rahul Gandhi should shut up. Enough of his nonsense is enough. In his 10 years as PM, Manmohan Singh never went to see a farmer also. Where was Rahul then.It would be much better for the country if Congress Party starts playing a positive role instead of always trying to rake up controversies.In the democracy, Rahul certainly has full rights for his opinion and free speech. He should use it to layout an alternative vision for India if he has problems with the direction country has taking now under Midi's leadership. People have voted BJP into power for a reason.</comment>

<comment>The last para- the question of more bars. That's for the people to answer.Do they want to enjoy a peg safely at their home towns or ride across the border to Karnataka and pile on enough for 2 days.And ride back on those twisty, narrow (albeit good) roads. In the dark. </comment>

<comment>दिस गई इस ए फकिंग मोरोण।</comment>

<comment>It sounds apt even in Hindi ;-)</comment>

<comment>AK and Rahul are living in India of 1970s where it was easy to fool Indians by doing all those fake dramas like holding hands with farmers, or eating food with poor or showing their fake tears all this while driving 7 Series BMW, traveling in Private jets, faking illness to get away on a paid trip, having crores in bank balances, making fraudulent claims and finally, claiming all the proofs but doing nothing.. India is no longer that place where people are illiterate snake charmers as Nehru showed the world.. India is where new techs are emerging and AK or Rahul do not belong here..</comment>

<comment>They have been quite successful in fooling people.</comment>

<comment>Modi fooled u too! Satisfied by getting jumla instead of 15 lac????</comment>

<comment>At least give proof of one scam where Modi involved.......</comment>

<comment>Vyaam n ol</comment>

<comment>Sounds like you would rather lose  another 15 lakhs or your entire life savings to prop up a Gandhi moron</comment>

<comment>U blind bhakt?</comment>

<comment>Its better to get fooled by a samrty than by a moron.Modi is not perfect, but do we have anyone better than him in India?</comment>

<comment>Smart monkey?</comment>

<comment>So u mean you are dumber than a smart monkey???</comment>

<comment>No its ur father langoor !</comment>

Did khujli  took  any action  against  sheila  despite  he had load of proofs ? No? Did anything  happen in electricity  fake  enquiry  ? No ? Did khujli  found  any proof  in gas prices  ? No ? Shameless  liars. </comment>
