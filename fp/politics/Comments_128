<comment>Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will never do anything with honesty given their loss of political power after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.</comment>

<comment>if mehbooba forms a secular govt with the help of Congress, NC and independent, then i think BJP will never form any coalition govt in J&K in future and bjp will be wiped out in valley and also in Jammu is fresh elections are held now and in future.A very good and positive decision by mehbooba for the betterment of J&K and to throw BJP from the power as soon as possible. BJP dream of his leader becoming a CM of valley state will be doomed for everha ha ha ha ah</comment>

<comment>What secular government can be formed with Congress and National Conference ?  It will be a Muslim League government and not an Indian government.</comment>

<comment>The media are at it once again. They don't leave an opportunity even over the dead. It is one more instance that the media are newsless.</comment>

<comment>Question is how long BJP can serve under Mehbooba ? I guess they will pull the plug in two years.</comment>

<comment>The BJP will not try any tricks on the Congress party and National Conference mold.  The BJP wants to get a strong foot-hold in Muslim majority areas with the cooperation of the local people.  The other parties will just use the Muslim population as vote banks and try to deceive them.  The People's Democratic Party leaders very well know these equations.</comment>

<comment>If state goes for re-elections BJP will surely get zero seats</comment>

<comment>of course you are right and also in jammu bjp will get a big 0</comment>

<comment>If Mehbooba tries to establish a government that essentially excludes Jammu altogether, Jammu And Kashmir will likely cease to exist. BJP likely to pursue a separate Jammu and Congress would be happy to support it as it would provide a state where it would neither require NC or PDP to be in charge. Ladakh as a Union Territory is also likely to be pushed if Mehbooba breaks the alliance. And she can kiss any support from the Centre goodbye. It is up to her the decision, but the consequences will could be serious</comment>

<comment>State Governments are functioning under Central Government.</comment>

<comment>matlab uska bhi banta dhar..</comment>

<comment>Both the corporate masks will try to exploit every opportunity.</comment>

<comment>Congress will not spare the opportunity to encash such emotional situation for their own political benefits,, &  to degrade Modi,, nothing  to.  Do. With Nation's sake....</comment>

<comment>Congress Party and the Nehru dynasty members are unscrupulous in their political approaches.</comment>

<comment>What is the status of Kashmir today as compared to when Raja of Kashmir handed over to India at the time of independence.Did he want it to have the status of POK? Is the special  status still meant for converting J&Kt into another Bangla Desh with refugees from Jammu and Ladakh taking shelter in other parts of India? It is right opportunity and time to revoke article 370 and allow people from other parts of the country move to J&K. Already we have reason to believe people of Pak have occupied Kashmir while Pandits were driven from Kashmir. This is the place where democracy or socialism failed to work but Islamic extremism has been allowed to take control over in the name of secularism card.In the event of a weak centre another exodus from J&K can be predicted   The political class of India should think of grim side of the future J&K going by the terms Mehbooba wants impose on the present BJP-TDP alliance.Revocation of article is necessary because political parties in Kashmir misused the "Special  Status" detrimental to the interest of people of J&K and Sovereignty of India.By revoking article 370 India can handle PoK problems also efficiently.</comment>

<comment>Mehbooba is playing hard ball and  seems to be keen on extracting her pound of flesh from the shameless BJPee. Remains to be seen if this unscrupulous  party will crawl when asked to bend in its desire to chomp away with   the loaves of Office !!</comment>

<comment>Mehbooba Mufti will lose power to the Congress, Conference and Buraiyat combine if it breaks the alliance with the BJP.  Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has been betrayed by the Nehru dynasty for a long time.  The Abdullah family will gain complete control with the  Congress party and the Muslim hard-line parties.  According to the Sonia-Rahul Gandhi clan, the Abdullah family members are the   preferred  people due to Caucasian heritage.  The PDP people with the Muftis and other leaders do not count according to the opinions of the Congress party members.</comment>

<comment>Sonia Gandhi must have done some gossip against Modi. She do not want section 370 removed from JK and Sonia Gandhi do not want any Kashmiri Pandits return to Kashmir.</comment>

<comment>who knows what kichdi is being made... ?</comment>

<comment>where is 56 inch ?? will he reestablish Kashmiri pundits ??</comment>

<comment>On the way... It takes time but will happen for sure.</comment>

<comment>Hahahah....#Blind_Bhakt</comment>

<comment>Nothing wrong in being a Bakth, everyone's a Bakth to a cause... Like you are a Bakth to everything anti Modi or anti India...But on the other hand there's something seriously wrong in being an AAP(re)tard... REETARD is a state of mind where everything logical is sin.</comment>

<comment>We should also respect the sentiments of the people of jammu and Ladakh. The Union Territory status for Ladakh was a long-standing demand. Due to the stupid Article 370, Jammu and Ladakh had become the colonies of Kashmir Valley. The best solution is to make Kashmir a buffer state like Bhutan or a guarded neutrality similar to Switzerland. Scrap Article 370 and grant statehood or UT status for jammu and Ladakh. The status of Hindus in Pakistan is infinitely worse than that of the Muslims in India. So any solution that involves Hindus ending up in Pakistan is far worse than a solution involving Muslims ending up in India.</comment>

<comment>We should rule all teh SAARC nations under the Indian Union per your calculations.  You are very right.</comment>

<comment>Wish Mufti Mohammad Sayeed may alive again to see d politics over his dead body</comment>

<comment>I am sure he could have foreseen the eventuality.</comment>
