<comment>Can the quantity of methane gas produced by India alone change the entire world climate to cause flooding only in Tamil Nadu? NDA's MPs  are playing dabbu to become popular over bogus talks.They should rather concentrate to give strong hand to Modi Govt for the development policies  for India, and  give hand to violent negative  opposition in India to disrupt parliament for petty issues and create  more trouble for the govt. as also to western countries to snub Modi for making West responsible for global warming.</comment>

<comment>well, obviously. climate change is probably like the last thing on their minds. their minds are probably stuffed with beef right now.</comment>

<comment>Restore the lakes in every city and remove lake and drainage encroachments.</comment>

<comment>Stop diesel vehicle manufacturing and sale. Increase public transport and declare vehicle free days. Stop Air Conditioners use and others which will improve quality of life. Repair the bad roads immediately.</comment>

<comment>The current situation of climate has been brought about by other countries, not that they are not suffering but also making us suffer and then offers to impose global restrictions, but that chokes our opportunity to develop.  Maybe 50 more years later "maybe" it will be our fault that too if we develop (the media and opposition is highly against it).So yes todays climate change is definitely not our doing, and please someone ask her not to preach shit. </comment>

<comment>I dont understand one thing- if they say these are the highest temperature/recorded rains in 100 years, then how can it be blamed on global warming/whatever? Surely 100 years ago, an even higher temperature/rains were recorded?</comment>

<comment>It's based on record keeping. Calculations are done based on available data, 100 years is the breadth of data that is being dealt with in this case.It doesn't mean what you're suggesting.</comment>

<comment>It might be due to climate change but surely when you cramp a city its river , ponds and other natural pits , surely it will bring floods. </comment>

<comment>Climate change does occur, but Maneka Gandhi exaggerates everything to her political  advantage like other members of the Nehru dynasty.  By accusing Narendra Modi and creating internal problems within the party, she thinks she can acquire more power for  Varun Gandhi within the BJP hierarchy.</comment>

<comment>RSS has an office where they employ people to spread propaganda . plus indians r easily manipulated with few images on social meadi or press.like Modis pic in which he is seen taking an aerial view of the flood.</comment>

<comment>RSS did good see it as advertisement or words of a sufferer. </comment>

<comment>.Knowledge is an outcome of study in depth followed by careful reflections.Mrs. Gandhi has been studying environmental science from her youth! Today she is a qualified expert in this field. We must heed what she says!Alas! In comes Modi who is instrumental in making Gujarat as a most chemically polluted state; and he with superficial  knowledge in environmental science takes a high ground: the ‘not our fault’.Chennai is suffering today! Why? Because we abused ecological balance! We too joined the world’s top carbon culprits.Today it is Chennai, soon it will be otherIndian metros!Wisdom is that we respect ecology and become a positive contributor in maintaining its balance..</comment>

<comment>Dude there is something called city planning storm drains and all, Chennai being one of the oldest city didn't manage it. So many cyclones dodged iIndia and others like Aila, dude that place is prone to such climate, its not wholly CO2 idiot, its normal for east coast to face cyclones anyways mitigation is something which was necessary, and impossible to restructure the city because you wont accept government land acquisition bills and related stuff, where in a city like chennai where will you have storm drains? (Build it on your head man idiot)Listen we get that you hate Modi, but dont be an idiot, Maneka Gandhi can be a expert on environment but i don't think she took town planning into account. </comment>

<comment>Long before environment became 'fashionable', principles of designing dams, bridges, railway lines etc had the requirement that you design for the severity of a 100 year flood (ie a flood which is expected to occur once in 100 years) and various methods including identifying old flood marks, asking old people etc were employed. This flood appears to be a 100 year flood and may not have much to do with climate change. It is more due to blocking / narrowing the natural channels. Environmental changes bring about Climate change is not disputed but it will be gradual.</comment>

<comment>All the comments on Chennai floods are completely off the mark. Human memory and deductive powers are indeed below the level needed  to run a country. Cloud burst in Uttarakhand, Kashmir , Quake in Nepal and several connected events have one simple reason that has caused the cloud burst in Chennai and along the south coast. Uranus and Neptune both the  giant planets have been hovering over the same section for  several  years now, have been playing havoc and will continue to do so for a few more years .We all know that even the tiny moon  creates giant tides at its closest transits that are only a few hours. The same planetary gravitation phenomena has caused the floods in Chennai made worse by the fact that moon transit along the ecliptic for the whole week now. Uranus Neptune transits occur very 168 years and the last one in 1847 played similar havoc lasting about 10 years according to scanty records that have survived. Man must understand that all these events can be predicted YEARS  in advance and the areas can be prepared in advance to  tackle it. It needs  the will and determination to create special cells  to monitor and predict. The urgent need for India is to create a network of canals to link  the rivers and even out rising flood waters immediately or else Chennai, Uttarakhand etc will be the result.When will people in the saddle learn to look beyond their noses? see kapillavastu dot com for an appraisal of how to conserve resources through forward planning instead of looking into the rear view mirror to plan tomorrow!!</comment>

<comment>Just sea the natural calamities statistics. All are occurring at very speedy phase in this two decades. There is something more than what you are explaining. Please visit NASA site.</comment>

<comment>This is a great discovery what Mrs Menaka Gandhi is speaking. It is very different from what IPCC and UNFCC, both UN bodies have been talking so far. According to these bodies, the share of India in the current Green House gases is about 6% though rising  and the aggregate contribution of India is less than 0.5%. According to accepted research, the climate change is the result of aggregate emission  ( pollution of last 200 years or so ). Mrs Gandhi should share her research work with world scientist and UN bodies otherwise it will be misconstrued that she like any other politician is pestering the everyone's punching bag Mr. Modi for a better portfolio.</comment>

<comment>Maneka Gandhi wants to push her son Varun Gandhi to the fore-front in the party hierarchy.</comment>

<comment>To all the environmentalists here, what you said is absolutely correct. But this is no moral issue or a matter of national value. It's purely international and national interest is what stands here. Don't believe me? Just check the per capita emissions of western countries like US and also China. We stand to be less emitters than the countries which are preaching to cut our emissions. Still if you want to show you faith towards mother nature then start opposing the real high emitter nations. Thank you.</comment>

<comment>Two targets with one arrow. That's Menaka Gandhi. With kids like Smriti Irani taking the best places, she has no way to hit the best bullseye.......</comment>

<comment>Degradation of forests by over 50%in last 4 decades is the main culprit. Adulterated & leaded fuel is another  cause for vehicular pollution  of massive scale . We use more coal to produce lesser power. High Methane due to poor disposal of waste, garbage & cattle waste is a serious issue too.How many more Chennai like deluge will wake us up is a big Questions.  Two days later, we will be back to our Chalton hai attitude. </comment>

<comment>Age is taking its toll on her intelligence. Recently she had offered a ridiculous advice to the people of Kerala to climb up a tree to save themselves from stray dog attacks. </comment>

<comment>Which tree?</comment>

<comment>Pine tree dumbass. </comment>

<comment>Neanderthals don't have sense of humour.</comment>

<comment>She is very very correct. She is very much concerned of the environment issues and for the cause of the animals welfare. her concerns are of the concerns of every human being . let's support her voice.</comment>

<comment>When it comes to environment, nature will not single out any party or religion. So it is better that we all understand this and support anyone who wants to take climate change more seriously. There will always be the ones who want to ruin all for a few buildings and roads. But we must go ahead and adapt ourselves to changing times. We must know how to put back carbon into the earth's crust and use green energy, reforestation and most of all, maintain our civic sense and not clog the rivers and drains. We Indians are notorious of treating rivers as dustbin. It is time to be 'civilized' in the real sense.</comment>

<comment>we accept a fact that on the terms of Volumes, due to sheer high population India becomes on of the highest polluter. But on per cpatia basis it is low, US with one third of India population is a bigger polluter than India.But the current enviroment condition is not due to pollution done by India it because of the past sins of others. Though we cannot be absolved of our responsibility to control pollution but the cost of this must be brone by the historical polluters. That what Modi stand is. If you see the commitment made by India, it is more than expected as compared to others, but the cost has to be brone on equitable basis and there is nothing wrong in it.</comment>

<comment>PER  CAPITA  BASIS   CO2 EMISSION  OF  US  IS  MUCH  HIGHER,,BUT IT  IS MISLEADING,,LOT  OF  METHANE  IS  GENERATED  IN  INDIA  DUE  TO  SHITTING  IN OPEN,,SEWAGE  ROTTING,,,ANIMAL  CARCASSES ROTTING,,ADULTERATION  IN VEHICLE  FUEL  ETC,,ALL  THESE  FACTOR  THOW UP  CO2  AND  METHANE WHICH  CAN  NOT  BE QUANTIFIED</comment>

<comment>FYI open defecating does not produces methane. Methane is only produced when carcass and fecal matter are in closed places with limited supply of oxygen.Agreed that co2 does not throw the actual picture but on close examination of atmospheric gases show significant increase in CO2 percentage ot in methane and other green house gases.I am not trying to justify that we should not anything to control this what my point is that the developed world should pay the cost.Modi too said we must act quickly on climate change but it should be at the cost of our delevopment. the cost of green technology should be shared by developed nation and there should be free technology transfer</comment>

<comment>Are humans destroying earth or earth is egging humans to do the harm so that nature can cleanse the earth ?Circle of creation and destruction is unavoidable - one can prolong it - but superiority of humans will end one day and like dinosaurs they will too be extinct.Nature will always claim back what was its originally and which we took for granted</comment>

<comment>Even if you are right,  it doesn't excuse you from doing your bit to a cleaner environment.</comment>

<comment>you mean loss of millions of human lives in a great disaster will be manure of the mother earth?</comment>

<comment>Why do we personify the nature and its laws as the mother? and why is the father missing from all this?</comment>

<comment>I was talking generally. the earth is called earth mother generally in India. Bhoodevi</comment>

<comment>Do you really need clarification or you understood first time you read my comment?</comment>

<comment>That's why I replied.</comment>

<comment>though I support vision of modi but she is 100% correct. we can't stand without mask in cities ,  footpaths and small roads are dustbins, no rule  followed to construct buildings , most of lake beds are encroached so where. water to flow</comment>

<comment>MADAM THIS IS NOT YOUR SUBJECT. WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT HAS NOTHING DIRECTLY TO DO WITH CLIMATE ENVIRONMENT MINISTRY. U ALWAYS COME UP WITH SOME OFF THE CUFF REMARK....TIME TO CONCENTRATE ON WHAT U ARE PAID TO DO! I CAN;T SAY IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY BUT PLEASE BE CAREFUL AS NOT TO ROCK THE BOAT.</comment>

<comment>You are correct with regard to portfolios.  But what Ms. Maneka Gandhi said is 100% correct.  Let us appreciate that atleast one Minister tells the truth in this subject, and this cannot be construed as 'rocking the boat'.   Otherwise, our future generations will have to pay a very heavy price.  We, the present generation should remember, that we should remembered for our deeds and actions and what and how we leave behind.</comment>

<comment>Stop Population growth, and Real Estate Development every where, water need to flow out from river area, you can't have all river area to be developed without letting water to be flown out. You need to have a balance in a city with population, and make more mangroves on river side area to stop flooding. Enough of Real Estate Development the green area of the country is diminishing very rapidly.</comment>

<comment>Maneka is another Jairam Ramesh. Craving international green awards. Nothing else matters them. Neither the nation nor the national interest.</comment>

<comment>Why we are not able to admit that it is our own greed - greed for buying multiple cars, houses as investments - which has led to the poor state of cities. #Giveitup is not limited to LPG - give up the greed, be content with basic needs. No PM or CM can change anything if we do not change ourself.</comment>

<comment>Cities like Bangalore are forcing people to use cars because of influence of lobbyists and insensitive legislators. Chennai has very good public transport, but still it has suffered! Chennai floods happened because illegal construction over drains, Otherwise, Chennai should not have flooding because it is so close to sea. With global warming more temperature will increase evoparation of water and so rain.</comment>

<comment>The point to consider is per capita emission, where India pollutes less. But if we use that criteria, the car owners, pollluters will go scotfree. There is need for carbon and congestion taxes immediately. Methane is a pollutant but it should not be considered because it is created by natural processes like farming and animal waste.</comment>

<comment>Methane is more than 25 times more potent than CO2 of course it should be considered and meat and dairy should be taxed, Just like cars/ bikes they are not necessities.</comment>

<comment>If you try to produce food for yourself in your own back yard, you will recirculate most of the waste including CO2. But if you want to stay in a apartment and wish to have food products home delivered, you will end up inhaling smoke only, walk in smog only. The choice is yours.</comment>

<comment>That is not a choice I or many of us have, each person needs at least 1.2 acre of land to produce enough food. Also cities (vertical cities even more so)are more efficient per person than villages.Your point looks (Just looks) Good, but will never work.</comment>

<comment>too hypothetical , no house is constructed leaving inch around their house, I left enough space around my house so all rat holes are in my garden</comment>

<comment>very true, Forest cover as per policy should be 60% in hilly areas and 33% in plains as per GOI  norms but it is bare abort 12 %.It was as far back as 1996 Supreme court issued concern but  sucessive government failed to take measure, we are heading for disaster  avoidable one</comment>

<comment>But Modi government has just come to power . Why did she not open her mouth when SIL wasguiding the affairs of the nation. Yes, we need to take heed.but India is not the major polluter...</comment>

<comment>We only have to look at what is happening in Chennai and Delhi to realize that we are harming our environment in very negative way. Rather than blaming each other its time to take some drastic steps to improve the climate.</comment>

<comment>DUE TO PARTICIPATE IN CLIMATE MEETING IN PARISH GOD SHOW ( GOD RAM ) MODI WHAT KIND OF A CLIMATE INDIA HAVE.</comment>

<comment>Wow...they will blame Modi for floods, too!!!!!!This is becoming a  mental disease...:)</comment>

<comment>so be late respected madam minister from bjp you understand it. good for the country.</comment>

<comment>What a strange coincidence...NDTV is the only TV whose shows are always full of Pot Shot on BJP/Modi govt....Starnge na....</comment>

<comment>Somebody kick this piece of $hit Gandhis out of BJP.</comment>

<comment>It flooded and cars were floating in the Gulf desert at Dubai few years back. We have put up thermal-based gas and coal power plants, while we were not allowed nuclear technology. These plants will stop if there is no coal.</comment>

<comment>Lets us face it that despite the fact that our children in Delhi and NCR are going to be worst suffers of pollution and may end up with lung related disorder in their late thirties yet we are not concerned.Do not blame political class they are busy with their own agendas,  Nice clean environment for our children has to our top agenda first then ask politician to do something. They keep fooling people to the point where they are thrown out.</comment>

<comment>no body has contradicted maneka....but the question is what is our priority...should we leave the present population struggling for future or we find a midway out.....I need job and clean environment also...govt have tough job on hand....but instead of all these we are discussing INTOLERANCE most of the times..unfortunately</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>For industrial purpse...if govt can take back from Industrialists those land which they have kept for years without using them...then all the reuirements will be filled for industry....but then the question is will govt do that or the otherway will industrialists allow that to happen....Agricultural farming also needs help from govt in the form of co operative farming.....since the land holding is small....so pooling resources togeher will help...But for all this we need a dedicated parliamentarian....sadly we have none...</comment>

<comment>Of course we all know that the developing countries are causing pollution. And their argument is that the developed countries have damaged the earth enough during their development phases, and now it's our turn. That's a just demand too.Except that they are also at equal or more risk, with such large population exposed to catastrophic events waiting to happen.</comment>

<comment>these are the consequences of last 30-40 years.....and yes its due to exploitation of sources by using chemicals.......obviously in future natural disaster will increase....we should be prepare for the results of our mistakes done in past.....</comment>

<comment>I feel that Maneka Gandhi  is correct in the "Tamilnadu Flood" Matter.  What I have seen was that the Tamilians lack in civic sense, and pollute the  surroundings by dumping the waste in the canals (eg: Buckingham Canal) and block the  water flow.Like this, water logged at several parts and flooding was the result .Regarding ban on entering the temple, as quoted by the MP, I would like to invite the whole gang of MPs to visit theGreat GURUVAYOOR TEMPLE, where at the entrance it is exibited as a prohibitory ORDER  --"NO ENTRANCE TONON-HINDUS". It is KERALA, not any North Indian State !!!!  Any response ?</comment>

<comment>It is nobody's contention that there is no truth in Maneka's point.  My issue is with ndtv and other anti -nationals that want to show this to weaken india's position in climate negotiations. Modi is negotiating in india's interest to bring electricity to all.    Also these comments by Maneka should put to rest the claim that modi is dictotorial.</comment>

<comment>Yes  Madam  Gandhi  ask your  chief  not to be  irilable. world knows.</comment>

<comment>Last 18 year one man is shouting,howling,lying,screaming, over the roof top...Climate surely going to Change</comment>

<comment>Ha ha - ha ha ha ha........</comment>

<comment>kind of construction going on india (flat culture) is worst....it should be stopped...atleast the number of floors can be limited....</comment>

<comment>Height of apartment  can be increased in certain places. But encroachment of lakes, marsh lands, aquifer zones, etc are catastrophic. Sensible development is sustainable development.</comment>

<comment>Its good that Maneka is speaking her mind... I also agree with Modiji's stand that India is not responsible for the mess created. Although its becoming evident that as India  will develop Green House emissions will rise...Maneka also rightly pointed that methane is a bigger problem than co2....However its difficult to explain it to people who want to create controversy for no reaon. As a solution I would have suggested that in both of their speeches Modi and Maneka should have included word SECULAR again and again . Then everyone in the media and opposition would have agreed to what they said and understand their view point</comment>

<comment>I second that.. Ms Maneka is speaking her mind but what media will portray it as Maneka is not in sync with MR Modi, she doesn't believe his ideologies and blah blah. End result will be just another controversy.</comment>

<comment>Both Menaka and Modi are correct in their own ways - it's all relative. Of course India is a huge polluter lack of regulations or lax enforcement or absent enforcement of its industries.  And so Menaka is correct. The Congress party that ruled the center is mainly responsible for it and so are the various state governments.Still the metric tonne of carbon dioxide per capita for India is 1.7 whereas for any nation in this west is way higher - Belgium 8.8; Denmark 7.2; Finland 10.2; France 5.2; Germany 8.9; Luxembourg 20.9; Netherlands 10.2; Spain 5.8 Sweden 5.5; United Kingdom 7.1; USA 17.  Thus Modi is correct.So, there is no real contradiction when Modi said that climate change is not our making and for Menaka to say that West alone cannot be blamed for the pollution. Experts suggest the plausibility that the severity of Chennai rains may have to do with El Niño effect, though it remains to be confirmed.Bottom line, all this article tries to do is an attempt to set the proverbial cat among pigeons. Good idea, but shoddy effort.</comment>

<comment>F.P. wants that the ministers must not have a mind of their own and should not tell contrary to a senior minister even on such matters like climate change where every opinion has its own merit.  At the same time, it also wants to blame Modi for centralising everything.</comment>

<comment>If it rains more and more when temp.goes up, why is most parts of India having a drought.</comment>

<comment>India is still struggling to improve the economy of its citizens. If the west wants us to start costly measures to stem climate change then they should subsidise us. If the climate gets worst the west have a lot more to loose than what Indians have that they can loose.</comment>

<comment>You have to look at per capita emissions - not just in absolute terms. Per capita we are not the biggest polluter. In absolute terms we are 3rd, but this is recent - maybe last 30 years. 30 years is not long enough to cause climate change. The west did not just pollute 100 years ago - they are doing it even today. If US with less than 1/4th of our population is polluting more than us today - you can imagine how much they are polluting. They have not done their fair share in fighting climate change </comment>

<comment>Looks like similar floods happened 100 years ago. Was India destroying climate then too.</comment>

<comment>whats up with all these anti modi news by fp and all these fake upvotes now days.??</comment>

<comment>We modify the nature to suit our comfort. Over the last 20 years, Chennai has developed so tremendously and as an inevitable modification, we built cemented roads, concrete buildings and tarred roads  everywhere. There is no place for water to sink down to the earth below!  To light our cities and homes, we burn coal all over India, adding to Green House effect, and warmer climate and melting of Ice bergs all over the world and heavy levels of rain fall as we are seeing in Chennai. When we modify the nature to suit our comfort, Nature replies through natural calamities.  I am worried about the drinking water shortage and its contamination all over the flooded regions, and the shortage of food materials. In addition, considering the overall damage to the equipment, vehicles and the huge loss to the economy as whole, are really making a real progress by modifying the nature to the extreme levels? Unless an alternate solution for the flood water to sink to the earth, the life will be miserable in the low lying areas of Chennai, especially for those who live in bungalow houses and ground floors. We must not forget that when flood water remains for longer time, it leads to decay of vegetation and generation of more of methane gas, adding to the Green House effect. This can trigger a positive feedback cycle of floods and methane gas.</comment>

<comment>Menaka Gandhi is right on spot,,methane gas is more dangerous than co2,most Indians shit in the open which generates methane gas,,animal carcasses are rotting in the open  which generates methane. ,,even in cities where toilets are used,sewarage gas had to be extracted and burnt,,all this is not done in India,so India is a major contributor to pollution in the form of methane</comment>

<comment>This is the fault of Modiji. The birth rate is not controlling. Their basic needs are going so high. Modiji is unmarried, no family. You narrow thinking. You see first ownself then others. You are the main culprit to climate change.</comment>

<comment>So basically if you have something to say against modi call up ndtv and fix up an interview. Now this nonsense will go on for a few days. I wish modi all the best to tackle all these opponents.</comment>

<comment>Hey prudence man. We can understand u narrow thinking guy. First u look and said any thing to our PM. He is honest man. Not working under pressure like MS. He take all decision by hook or thook. He always thinking for nation. He is real citizen of India.</comment>

<comment>One has to review history ..... corruption root cause of all evils ... atleast PM discouraged corruption from top level.  We have to salute him ...   just remember Congress rule last 60 years ....</comment>
