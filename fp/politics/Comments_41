<comment>Until now, the BJP could claim to be different from the Congress due to inner party democracy. The current leadership seems to be transforming it into a modern day version of Congress (I) where no one dare criticize the leader. This mindset of denial and refusing to come to terms with reality is going to be a disaster if it continues that way. This iron fisted leadership will ultimately result in there being no change in the basic structure of BJP or Congress. Hope the leadership has the sense to understand and correct their course. If not, it's going to be just another party of leaders and sycophants.</comment>

<comment>Pappu has not failed at all.  See the media everyday he gets first page coverage whereas, many successful politicians are forgotten.  Moreover, he belongs to Nehru's family which is always first family and they have the right to rule this country perpetually.  Further, the family is very kind to corrupt, black money people, land grabbers,  etc. Even Indian judiciary is not able to haul them up.  See Vadra's case, is he going to jail, never. Pappu belongs to such a powerful family his grand mother even had guts to suspend the constitution and declare emergency,  which PM has such power?</comment>

<comment>If we have a strong leader as PM, we complain. If we have a weak leader as PM, we complain. If we have a regional leader as PM, we complain.</comment>

<comment>History is a good lesson, was India ever united and ruled by a single person or dynasty for a long stretch of time  ? how many national leaders have we had ? Ashoka, Samudra Gupta, aurangzeb, Akbar ?I predict regional parties will come bouncing back sooner or later if BJP ignores or tries to scuttle regional leaders of its party.</comment>

<comment>This is the nature of politics. You have to ensure that the regional satraps do not become a threat to you. The comparison with Vajpayee is entirely misplaced. For one, he had been a national leader for a number of years, unlike Modi whose politics was confined to the state level till recently. Secondly, the regional chieftains in the Vajpayee era were light weights compared to Chauhan or Raman Singh. They were never a threat to Vajpayee whose only rival for the top job was Advani, another national level leader.  This is how the real world works - you can give no quarter to those whose latent hostility to you on account of personal ambitions cannot be disregarded. This is how it has been since times immemorial and this is how it shall always be. The incumbent will always be at risk vis a vis the challengers and he needs to do what it takes that his position at the top is not threatened.</comment>

<comment>The best thing Modi can do now is to jail the Italian gang by hook or by crook. A party is power in never short of incriminating documents and these foreigners should be shown no mercy. This will galvanize all patriotic Indians and dampen Mahagathbandhan type adventures. There is so much hatred for these white skinned crooks that Modi's position will become invincible.</comment>

<comment>Jail ?? No !! Then they will say he is  Fascist and all. Then there will be protests by stupid caste obsessed Marxists. So no jailing. We need to deport them. Throw this Khangress swine outside our Holy land !!</comment>

<comment>They will run off themselves if things get too hot, and then the House of cards will collapse. It is this nucleus which is long term danger to India - a dagger pointed right at India's heart. But I m sure Modi knows what to do. His record of eliminating opponents is impressive.</comment>

<comment>Yep !! He has been through hell after 2002 under the hands of media.  His calm mindedness is his is strength. That's something learned during his pracharak days</comment>

<comment>I feel the fun is going to start soon. All those who complained that Modi is not acting against Gandhis don't know how Govt functions. You may know about the general contours of a scam but taking it forward needs documents, and they take time to unearth. A aprty in power holds all cards if it wants to screw someone and a chargesheet can always be filed.I feel that S Swamy will be used as battering ram and all documents and help extended to him by Govt agencies.</comment>

<comment>Well, up to Modi to accept challenge. All the Papu statements are going to come now, The Real Pappu of Indian politics has been Modi, who speaks of plurality but his MPs and party members speak the other language, who has failed on black money promise, who has lost 2 states for his party this year and who has failed to act against Raje...with charge similar to one they put on Vadra...in fact more clear since Vadra isn't in active politics, Raje and her son are. To top it all off, he used to make jibe at MMS for being week against Pakistan, they've martyred more of our soldiers and civilians in the last 18 months than the preceeding similar period of MMS.</comment>

<comment>Okay lets vote for papu then . Who says all the complex problems in economy can be solved by women empowerment.</comment>

<comment>The less and less we hear of RSS and Bhagwat and other right-wing loonies, the more it seems BJP is the saviour of the nation socially and economically. We have enough culture to go by for a few thousand more years. What we need now is a party that is smart, strong and development oriented and BJP can be just that if it can keep the RSS shut forever.</comment>

<comment>You are making stupid suggestions . Can the body function without  the mind ??</comment>

<comment>The mind you are talking about has a bi-polar disorder. They are usually high-functioning but also equally hazardous.</comment>

<comment>The mind you are talking about has a bi-polar disorder.</comment>

<comment>The RSS and Hindutva is what separates BJP form the rest of the parties. BJP was born because the Hindutva  needed a political arm. Without RSS and Hindutva  there would have been no BJP. Without RSS there would have been no MODI. No chai walas becoming PMs. Only dynastic rules.</comment>

<comment>That is a narrow mindset. If BJP severs itself ideologically from the RSS, it could go a long way in the country as a political party and could take the country where it cannot go when its associated with the divisive RSS. See the number of companies that started selling something totally different but are conglomerates now from Berkshire Hathaway to Reliance. Even Maruti was started by Sanjay Gandhi but today's Maruti Suzuki is a far cry from how it started. I know I am giving corporate examples but that is why one must think innovative. There is a large hole in the country for a political party that is non-corrupt and development-oriented without any ideological baggage. If the BJP doesn't take the chance, someone else is certainly going to. Just wait and watch.</comment>

<comment>Now that the RSS and its religious agenda/propaganda has fallen flat on its face, will the BJP at least now realise there is nothing more the people of this country want than development? If this week is anything to go by, it looks like it has indeed woken up and realised. I am pretty impressed with the traction this week on reforms on various fronts by the BJP. I think we must really thank the smart people of Bihar for this.</comment>

<comment>The best thing is that the Bihar win of Vikas Purush Nitish, has spurred Arvind Kejriwal also into action!</comment>

<comment>Yes I noticed that. This is precisely how a democracy should function.</comment>

<comment>The people of Bihar have nothing to do with this. AND Modi was always development oriented.</comment>

<comment>Ohh please...you can yell me 1000 times u r einstien...it wont turn you into one</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should learn the spelling of "Einstein" first, no? Maybe you should write it down a 100 times so that it registers in your brain, even if it won't turn you into one.</comment>

<comment>Modi wasn't talking development in Bihar. He was talking caste, religion and freebies.</comment>

<comment>FYI, he was talking about it in the context of casteist politics being dominant in Bihar, especially under Lalu's rule. He criticized Congress for being hypocritical in their secularism when it was accusing BJP of nurturing intolerance, by pointing out their involvement in the 1984 riots and their shielding of the guilty. As for the freebies, you got the name wrong. It was SUSHIL Modi, not Narendra Modi who did that. But don't blame the BJP for that. Every party is guilty of doing that during election time.</comment>

<comment>This is where disruptive thinking is required. 2014 lok sabha election wasn't won on caste or religion. It was won on corruption, governance and development. Why has the agenda changed in 2015? It is quite bizarre. Applying Occam's razor, this simple reason is the reason why 2015 elections have been lost by the BJP.</comment>

<comment>Maybe. But why antagonize BJP over everything? Every party announces hefty packages and incentives and freebies. It's a political strategy adopted by every party to woo often illiterate and immature voters. The hypocrisy among us citizens as a whole is that we badly desire development but don't wish to hear how it is or can be brought about. That's the reason vitriol in speeches coupled with promises of freebies, attracts crowds more than any talk of development can possibly achieve. Modi or BJP can't be blamed for the idiocy of a couple of motormouths. How is it that Rahul Gandhi, the VP of Congress gets away with making reckless and unsubstantiated statements or even Digvijay Singh for that matter? In any case both JD(U) and Congress piggybacked on Lalu's popularity to bag a lucrative position in the Bihar mandate. I can bet that there will be no development in Bihar and that Lalu has merely established a "puppet" government. Bihar got set back by 25 years at least. Also, more so, Lalu-Nitish won more because of BJP and RSS' faults than by any special talent or merit of their own. And that's saying something.</comment>

<comment>Breaking his silence today on the continuing BJP allegations against him, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi today issued a challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanding that either the BJP proves its charge or keep its peace."The BJP and RSS people have been flinging dirt on my family forever, on my grandmother, my father and my mother. I have been seeing this since I was a child," Mr Gandhi said at a function to mark the 98th birth anniversary of former prime minister Indira Gandhi."I want to say this, Modiji it's your government, you have all the agencies. Set them after me. Launch an investigation me and if find anything in six months put me in jail... but stop using your lackeys to dump dirt on my family," he said.</comment>

<comment>Havent seen this on FP yet. The BJP is finding its reforms mojo after Bihar polls big time. This is what the BJP should have concentrated on before the Bihar elections and passing GST would have been much easier.http://economictimes. indiatimes. com/markets/stocks/news/buckle-up-reforms-earnings-can-lift-sensex-to-30000-in-2016/articleshow/49843588.cms</comment>

<comment> A MAN LITERALLY ASKED FOR PAKISTAN'S HELP TO REMOVE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED P.M. OF INDIA BUT THE LEFTIST INTELLECTUALS DIDN'T BURST INTO "INTOLERANCE" MARCH!!!! WOW, WHAT "TOLERANCE" TOWARDS "PAKISTAN APOLOGISTS"!! </comment>

<comment>have u seen the full interview if not watch it again</comment>

<comment>So does that justify when he said "Aap modi ko hatao, hum ko le aao". Even the pakistani anchor was amused what kind of a moron aiyer is? He said "woh kaam aapko karna hai, humko nahin". Only brain dead people like you can support such statements made in a country, which is considered as an enemy of India.</comment>

<comment>watch the interview again</comment>

<comment>For a intelligent person, watching once is more than enough. Even the pakistan media has run counter debates after the foolish statement of aiyer. Do you think all are fools? Whatever is the sum total of his statements, the means don't justify it. Lastly, to correct you, it was not an interview, but a debate as their were other guests in the program, if I remember, there were four including aiyer. A seasoned politician making a seditionist statement in front of a panel, is not foolish, but criminal in nature. Even the pakistanis are shocked by his statement. Can any educated person condone the statement "aap modi hatao, hum ko le aao"? Even in India such a statement against a ruling dispensation having a wide majority of seats will be considered a crime, and making the same in an enemy country & stooges like you justifying is all the more insane.</comment>

<comment>Narenda-Modi is must if India has to come out of colonial Islamic rule. Rest everything is secondary. Note the visceral hatred all Muslim  / liberal commentators have for Modi - proof enough that he has hit them where is hurts. No one kicks a dead dog.India's future will be hopeful if we come out of foreigner rule - whether European or Arab-Muslim. Even if Modi brings no dramatic reforms in 5 years, how does it matter? Congress didn't do anything in 60 years. But long term continuation of BJP is a must if Indians desire self rule.</comment>

<comment>yes and it shows the TOP ten criminal list when we search NARENDRA MODI</comment>

<comment>but one has to appreciate his sense of dresses obviously! What a wardrobe! even VijayaLalita will be envious! no other foren leader can go near to him! Omama has already acknowledged that.</comment>

<comment>Arey bhai... it is part of service tax ... n that to for a good cause....</comment>

<comment>I cannot agree with you. Somebody robbing me to fulfill his fetish of fancy dress and rangin chaddi, cannot be called good cause.</comment>

<comment>Bhai earlier we used to pay 3% service tax, 4% VAT and 10 % Stamp duty... now  the service tax has become 3.5 %...  will u agitate for other taxes to....</comment>

<comment> AND WE ARE SUPPOSE TO BELIEVE THAT??? </comment>

<comment>Both Feku and Kangressis are criminals. Just like Chot Rajan and Dawood. The all must be hanged.</comment>

<comment>yes google shows the fact</comment>

<comment>People complained when Manmohan had no control over his ministers. People complain when Modi controls them, so no scams take place. What do people want?Scams and a fiefdoms of ministers or astrong centre?Idont think Centre is interfering in BJPruled states,It is just a figment. Modi is being unjustly maligned. And Indira Gandhi was woshipped. Funny situation . Indians are never happy and they deserve third rate leaders like Lalu,andPappu.Forget progerss, be happy if we dont regress with people like Lalu coming back.</comment>

<comment>Modi controls the ministers?.....hahahahahaIf that were true bhartiya jumlabaaz party wud ve won bihar</comment>

<comment>not a fair comment, Gujarat, Maharshtra and most other progressive states are firmly with BJP or NDA, no pappus n lalloos there.Bihar is still a backwater n it will take time. no need to be alarmed</comment>

<comment>No scam? what's 36,000 crore ramana singi scam, Shavraj singi Vyapam horror movie scam, DDCA Karun jhatley scam, Basudha carpet scam, Lalit artistry scam! many more!</comment>

<comment>State and central Govt are separate entities. Read Pol science 101...........</comment>

<comment>Indians are impatient, can't take orders and think they are know alls - all hallmarks of a childish people. Is it any surprise then that such a vast country was defeated an any invader who cared to cross the Khyber, handful though he might be.</comment>

<comment>U too are an indian</comment>

<comment>Shatru was sidelined because he was part of the obstructive Advani gang.... prefer not having BJP in govt than member of this group heading it</comment>

<comment>Bihar It was a victory for the message, not the postman</comment>

<comment>BJP is just failing in media management. If we go by work content BJP is way ahead of UPA. Even in case of lose talk UPA guys were more outrageous only thing was that media was not reporting.. Even now Mani Shankar Aiyyar's remark gets hardly any mention however comments of Sakshi maharaj gets headlines space.</comment>

<comment>>> Mani Shankar Aiyyar's remark gets hardly any mention however comments of Sakshi maharaj gets headlines space.Media has also adapted to the current trends of "customer deciding the product". They put out a story and up it or kill it depending on how it engages people - real people, not fake social media handlers.From the view of an average media consumer, Mani Aiyyar comment was stupid and an insult to the office of PM but Sakshi Maharaj comment was poisonous and dangerous to the very existence of fellow muslim citizens.Muzzafarnagar riots might have worked once (or twice, if you count gujarat riots), but as BJP has realized, delhi tilokpuri riots or bihar's anti-beef posters only leads to a loss.</comment>

<comment>So you support pakistan to unseat Modi.. i think we should devide India one more time.. those who love Pakistan should get separate country.. Atleast we who want our independence and progress live in separate country.</comment>

<comment>I said: Mani Aiyyar comment was stupid and an insult to the office of PMYou replied: So you support pakistan to unseat ModiA true moditard indeed! :D</comment>

<comment>Fully Agree</comment>

<comment>I don't care. We want Modi & only Modi! </comment>

<comment>Stalin is attending Nitish's oath taking ceremony. So, Jaya will be on the other side. KCR will certainly extend "outside" support, because he simply cannot afford to see Congress grow. Pawan Kalyan with all his Kapu votes will again play the Item girl role before elections. Thanks to Tipu, BJP's chances are actually brighter in Karnataka. Kerala too is seeing a marginal improvement in BJP presence. All these things are going to add up and work for BJP.</comment>

<comment>oh what a dream</comment>

<comment>In the morning I wanted to daydream that ..Rahul Baba giving speech at Red fort.... Saala dream also rejected the idea.. :)))))))))))</comment>

<comment>bhakts cant dream also that much hawabaaz and Jumla made them dumb</comment>

<comment>There's a difference between dream & day dream. What Avnesh said was "day dream", which is voluntary unlike dream which is involuntary. That's why he said even his voluntary action rejected the idea. So, please understand the sentence before you comment. Hawabaaz & jumla is better than monumental corruption, atleast it shows the money is rightly spent on development causes rather than giving 15 lakhs free to beggars, who don't know to earn but wait for somebody else to throw food & money on them.</comment>

<comment>my only dream is to see congress from 44 to 0 ! :))))))))))</comment>

<comment>no need for that, its good to have a silly opponent</comment>

<comment>Thadhastu!</comment>

<comment>that will be always dream 13 yrs of GUJ modi cant do that in GUJ what he can do in entire India</comment>

<comment>N Biggest youth Icon of India is  Shri Pappu Gandhi :)))))))))</comment>

<comment>After a thousand of relaunch, Rahul baba is still in the dream phase....   :)))))</comment>

<comment>no issues 27 out of 41 contested how many seats BJP won and contested in Bihar</comment>

<comment>Bihar respects corruption and reveres corrupt politicians. Don't expect the rest of India to vote on the lines of Bihar and UP.</comment>

<comment>India is much bigger than bihar, wake up</comment>

<comment>Do you seriously think people voted for congress based on pappu's charismatic leadership? If yes, then you are living in an illusion. Lalu will be cursing himself, saala isko 40 seat dediya, jo mera tha. Even lalu & pappu would not have expected before elections that congi will get so many seats. Let's see in UP, unless pappu parasites somebody else and starts riding piggy back, which will prove his mettle, that has failed in umpteen number of elections.</comment>

<comment>was BJP ruling Bihar.. ??</comment>

<comment>8 yrs who was the ally for JDU you are so dumb</comment>

<comment>Prior to this election JDU had 115 seats.....</comment>

<comment>they contested 101 only now and dumb you questioned had BJP ruled i mentioned 8 yrs why no reply on the same need more burnol</comment>

<comment>so after 8 yrs .. who ruled ??? :)))))Anyways.. Under Modi leadership BJP made govt.. in 4 states .. which was not ruled by them....</comment>

<comment>next 2 yrs JDU with RJD and people liked it so they voted back them</comment>

<comment>in gujarat even opposition leader(Congress chief) is  from BJP..</comment>

<comment>60 seats in GUJ assembly what modi has done to make it to zero</comment>

<comment>but if out of 60, 40 are ex bjpites than? Secondly congress mukt bharat means actually nehru gandhi family mukt bharat.. we don't want prime ministers and chief ministers accountable to none other than one family. they should be accountable to people. in congress anyone can be CM who send money to first family(I am talking with concrete evidence).</comment>

<comment>like MPs now in BJP are ex congressmen you cant do congress mukth anytime</comment>

<comment>it wll happen.. as soon as we start educating public congress will fade away..let me make myself clear.. i said educating not certifying..</comment>

<comment>yes in land acquisition modi educated via monkey baat formed teams to educate ppl but what happened in the end</comment>

<comment>Land acquisition was necessary unfortunately rumors of opposition and media defeated right cause.</comment>

<comment>BJP is all set to gift the victory to Maha Mahagatabandhan in 2019 on a gold platter, unless it acts now proactively. Don't leave KCR and Chandrababu. If you lose Jaya, you will lose victory. Fight elections ONLY on development. Use duct tape to silence the loose mouths.</comment>

<comment>Like political correctness matters!! Look at lalu . Did he fight on development agenda ??? No !! Caste obsessed fools don't give a damm about development. BJP needs to polarize. Let Hindus vote as one block , and BJP is unstoppable !!!!!!!</comment>
