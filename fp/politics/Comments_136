<comment>how is this that when upper caste people grab all plum post in any govt. department with their clout and marginalised class employees are transferred here and there, is it not casteism ?It is reality of India and you cannot be selective about it, when it suits upper caste people they make most profit out of it and when they see they might lose on some resources grabbing like seat in educational institute, Govt. Job or politics they start to denounce it. This is double standard.</comment>

<comment>What the heck ... Why do u need caste? If it is for the purpose of reservation make it based on economic status of people. Not on caste</comment>

<comment>Your comments reeks of negativity - the smell is un-mistakable, it is that of constitution, which has kept people poor, by making them wage Jihad against "upper castes". The real upper castes are the government brahmins.  Politicians/bureaucracy are having a swell day looting. Drivers, fitters, cooks are running away from your reservation paradise.</comment>

<comment>Is this for real? A convicted politician given such importance in a public forum. Media is more crooked and maleficent than the politicians. Absolutely disgusting.</comment>

<comment>He served his time. Unlike the goons in his opposition who are roaming free</comment>

<comment>MK Gandhi was a dead man long before he was killed.  Any doubts? Try using his super human ideas in practical life. Anna became Gandhian after a suicide attempt. Because none effectively fought Gandhi in his days -  it includes everybody including Ambedkar, 1947 batch were a set of dead men.  Look out! Following Jihad of Gandhi Topisi against white man led to partition riots, following Ambedkar on reservation policy will lead another civil war as in Sri Lanka, which started with reservation policy.So much for idealism.Bury the 1947 batch by having new constitution, based on Individual rights and freedom[that is capitalism] and free gun laws as in USA.</comment>

<comment>Why is that in India its not  ok to be communal but completely ok to be Casteist?  The fact this the media has enabled this gutter of a person Lalu to become the poster child of secularism shows the sorry state of liberalism in India.They will sell of the country if it will keep bjp out of power!</comment>

<comment>Why the Ghanchi caste of Feku was included in the OBC category by the Gujarat Govt. led by BJP ??</comment>

<comment>Because to become Chaiwala he need reservation.And he can't BECOME pm and cm too if no reservation was given to him.Congress got 50% seat but modi got 20% but due to reservation he won.</comment>

<comment>A convicted Criminal is interacting with students and lecturing them about polity? The organisers of this "show" and the media which reports this have any morality left?</comment>

<comment>Network18 has to hide its head in shame</comment>

<comment>Caste really needs to be made irrelevant to public life. Caste is a cultural identity that cannot be eradicated. Just like you cannot stop talking in your native language or worship your gods. Many people seem to think that caste should simply vanish for India to prosper. My opinion is that caste discrimination is what needs to go. As long we have crooks who claim to work for one caste or another, they will keep the passions burning and there will never be a long lasting solution.</comment>

<comment>People of great India, state of Bihar, can you reject cast politics. India needs progress. The state of Bihar needs progress. How long people of Bihar stay away from their homes, their family and bashed and seen unwanted in other states. Get your right choice. Discard politicians with retched thinking. This is your time..people. c'mon rise !  BJP also need to give up over-confidence and stay on ground. Its a mother of all election. The whole world is looking for making or breaking of India as Bihar being at center-stage.</comment>

<comment>Caste identity matters as soon as you move out of big cities. Infact during marriage, caste identity matters even in the big cities.</comment>

<comment>Caste is an ugly reality in India. Those who want to ignore Castes are fools of the first order !!</comment>

<comment>Those who  go against uniform laws are cannibals. Well, one can rationalize cannibalism</comment>

<comment>Bihar people will vote on caste or whatever basis. The problem others in india will need to endure as these people will come andtake jobs and other needs from all other states. What is the idea of beliving in caste when they cannot stay in their state?</comment>

<comment>In states like Bihar, TN states out of total problems in these states minimum 50% of it is attributed to caste and further it goes to 69% in TN besides it is accentuated by additional 15% to 20% by religious problems..This is the idea of states in India.Younger generation started seeing no merit in these ideas. They look forward to solving problem on economic basis setting aside caste and religion.</comment>

<comment>Which caste did these youths belong. Every survey says,  Upper case people have praised Nitish, but said they would vote for BJP for obvious reasons. Dalits, Mahadalits, extreme other backward classes were tried to be conglomerated with NDA.</comment>

<comment>kudos to the youths. good, youths denounce castes. Let's throw the politicians to the hell who play card  of  caste and religion  for power sharing.</comment>

<comment>Lalu gadha he...15 raaj kiya bihar pe, aur aaj bhis sala caste or communalism felakar jitna chahta he?..does he tell what is his vision, policies for state??? illliterate lootera</comment>

<comment>To the resident aapturds who asked me to wait until DU election results are over, to see that langur Kejriwal win - well, we did and kejriwal came, he campaigned, and fell flat on his face..The people are not morons, they can see what you lot have been doing in delhi which is absolutely NOTHING..either way, since kejriwal campaigned for nitish, lalu and congress in Bihar, we have every faith that IT will fall flat on its face, all over again..</comment>

<comment>Delhi kids proved they are smarter than their parents :)</comment>

<comment>LOL..True 'dat..</comment>

<comment>next five years for bihar with lalu means total backwardness and end of nitish regime people of bihar should vote bjp as modiji is boss and he can command the CM of nda towards progressive path he has changed image of india worldwide now bihar must change its image of backwardness lalu means dirty politics dump nitish-lalu-rahul  for betterment of bihar</comment>

<comment>Fakeriwal campaigned for CYSS in DUSU Elections - Result: 0/4 (Overall 3rd position amongst 3 key contenders)Fakeriwal now gonna campaign for Convict Laloo + Hawalabaaz Sonia + Zehreela Naag Nitish in Bihar :==> Acche Din for Bihar :) :)</comment>

<comment>One really hopes that the people of Bihar specially the youth dump this convicted criminal out on the bail,Toilet(La Loo) Prasad Yadav in to garbage can, electric arc weld the lid and throw the can in to the deepest part of some fodder polluted swamp far away from Bihar/India!

<comment>which party, except left and AAP, does not play caste/ religion/ regional/ dynastic politics?</comment>

<comment>AAP does one better. It plays the bhukha nanga and bijlichor politics</comment>

<comment>But the same youth would rush to join the queue where reservation is being dispensed.</comment>

<comment>That only goes out to prove that reservation policy(a murder of merit) is shameful and it is not to be indulged in in presence of all.The point is political parties, state has emancipated themselves from democracy by the vehicle of reservation policy.That is because stable VOTE BANKS are formed.</comment>

<comment>Is this a turning point when the young throw the progeny of the Nehru-Gandhi-Ambedkar-Periyar trash like Lallu and the Indian Constitution into the crematorium?</comment>

<comment>like it or not ambekar wanted reservation only till 1970's due to condition in those days :p....all these years they are having ammendments every 10 years to extend reservation</comment>

<comment>You are wrong! The original provision in the Indian Constitution was only for Ten years.</comment>

<comment>ya sorry, ambedkar put in place  till 1960</comment>

<comment>Go and see the Ambedkar-Gandhi Poona Pact. Reservation for 10 years was given in the legislature for equality in representation but reservation in public services have no fixed time frame. The amendment is meant for legislature only.</comment>

<comment>How can any idea of little pregnancy  work? Murder of merit is murder all right.Send home all the government employees because they live on tax payers money by DEFINITION and not on profitsThe point is political parties, state has emancipated themselves from democracy by the vehicle of reservation policy.That is because stable VOTE BANKS are formed.</comment>

<comment>You mean to say that the Army and Police should earn profit for Government in controlling law and order.</comment>

<comment>Since any government employee by DEFINITION live on tax payer's money, they cannot live on earned profit.1)Go for all out privatization2)Perhaps police and army are required[however our India example of East India company, where police and army and judges were private sector employees contradicts the assumption]3)Free gun laws for self defense+  capitalism</comment>

<comment>In India where a vast population lives under poverty, squalor and there is a huge income inequality privatisation will be a one sided approach. We need a certain percentage, the concept of Welfare State, where some of the tasks which the private entities cannot do for obvious reasons of profit motivation, the government has to step in.</comment>

<comment>MK Gandhi was a dead man long before he was killed. Any doubts? Try using his super human ideas in practical life. Anna became Gandhian after a suicide attempt. Because none effectively fought Gandhi in his days - it includes everybody including Ambedkar, 1947 batch were a set of dead men. Look out! Following Jihad of Gandhi Topisi against white man led to partition riots, following Ambedkar on reservation policy will lead another civil war as in Sri Lanka, which started with reservation policy.So much for idealism..Bury the 1947 batch by having new constitution, based on Individual rights and freedom[that is capitalism] and free gun laws as in USA.</comment>

<comment>A new Constitution cannot be written overnight and without the consent of oppressed and downtrodden peoples. See this reality. You have stated half truth of both Gandhi and Anna and overlooking the results they achieved in their life. A majority of masses lives in inequality with a minority being the elitist and capitalist class. Imagine who will be at the loosing side if a civil war breaks here. You can see how Maoist are giving challenge to the Government. Your's theories does not meet the requirements on the ground.</comment>

<comment>My ideas are not empty "theory" [ignoring life]. Rather the 1947 batch was full of such theories. Proof of the pudding is in the eating Just look at wealth and power USA where Individual rights are protected.</comment>

<comment>If India does not write a new constitution with absolute protection for Individual rights - India deserves, beggary, civil war like in Africa and the government brahmins [people who receive reservation benefits] are to blame. India will once again enter dark ages.Socialism was introduced into constitution, during emergency. Constitution  winks at Naxallites encouraging them to set up a single party dictatorship like it did to Indira Gandhi. </comment>

<comment>There is a need of wide range of reforms in Hinduism. The first one to start is increased mobility across different castes by marriage. In this way the difference between Sarkari and Inherited Brahmins can be cleared. After all, the developed nations and those aspiring one have shed up their ego's in achieving harmony inside the country. If Apartheid can be done away with who stops casteism to get nullified.</comment>

<comment>Since right or wrong comes from class, caste origin, there is no right and wrong!  Mixed economy gives the right  to the Bureaucracy/Judiciary/Politicians to become the supreme arbiter. Power will be snatched away from the entrepreneur and capitalism to the bureaucracy which cannot INCREASE the size of the cake - Nation thus sinks into civil war. Sri Lanka is an example where 30 year civil war statrted with reservation policy. As India bigger than Sri Lanka it requires  a little more time to catch fire.</comment>

<comment>Wondered why India is so low on all human development indicators?Stateist argument is incorrect as bureaucracy has a profoundly destructive influence on the human mind. Inequality does not destroy the human mind, lack of freedom kills human mind.</comment>

<comment>The sense in which reservation was created was not murder of merit.. it was to bring out talent from all pockets of life. Shallow politicians misused it.</comment>

<comment>The point is, no good can EVER come out of murdering INDIVIDUAL rights for social, national good. Yudhistira was so so wrong when he told that an Individual can be sacrificed for family, a family for a city and city for a nation. THE ONLY WORK OF A GOVERNMENT IS PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS - JEFFERSON.USA has shown that only by protecting Individual rights creativity, invention can prosper. USA has been the source of all inventions, bulbs, to aeroplanes to computers to bio-techonology</comment>

<comment>aap policy for youth kiss of love in centre of streets lol ...they hv no jobs, but free kiss, free electricity and all those freebies</comment>

<comment>There is no more beautiful way to describe at once the problem with leftist goons, and the changing mindset of the youth of this country, than those 2 simple sentences.Lalu: "Do you believe in casteism?!!" Youth: "NO!"Perhaps there is still hope for the future of India after all...</comment>

<comment>If people vote for likes of Lalu, Mulayam, Nitish,and Rahul, there is no future for India.</comment>

<comment>That was exactly my point</comment>

<comment>Now Italian MINIONS  alongwith their counterpart of pAAP come in rescue of caste system.No pAAPad or MINION of PAPPU dared to criticize LALOO.They are drowned in their ocean of slavery</comment>

<comment>Funny that the youth who do not believe in caste silently accept their parents choice of marriage partners according to caste and horoscopes </comment>

<comment>That's okay, marriage is a personal matter and marrying within the caste does not hinder economic progress of the country, but electing useless leaders on caste basis would.</comment>

<comment>Youth should kick off their parents to old age homes like Italy.#SARCASM#SARCASM#SARCASM</comment>

<comment>If you have children , hope they have noted this fact.</comment>

<comment>I am a senior citizen. I have seen that the elders are the main cause for the difference between their children and their spouse.  The reasons range from dowry to jealousy.</comment>

<comment>Is IQ DECREASING in India or putting #sarcasm is must on comment which supposed to be sarcastic</comment>

<comment>sarcasm is also based on one's sanskars and upbringing. it reflects upon your personality and thinking.</comment>

<comment>Yeah I am commenting on Italians sanskars and MINIONS of ITALIANS got hurt.My bad,...Sorry MINION !!</comment>

<comment>Losing DU ELECTIONS</comment>

<comment>Even the self presuming Hindu Hriday Samrat Feku believes in caste structure as otherwise, he will not be projecting himself as the first OBC Prime Minister (which is ofcourse devoid of truth as Deva Gowda was the first OBC PM. But Feku always fancies himself getting away with lies). He will also not be hailing Manjhi as the darling of the Dalits in public platform  and rail, rave and rant against Nitish for back stabbing a poor Dalit ?What about his flirtations with Khushwaha who presents himself as a OBC leader par excellence as well as our dear Paswanji who also is in the forefront of mobilization on caste lines and is in a slugfest with Manjhi as to who is the real representative of Dalits !?You can understand such crude cynical  caste politics adopted by Lalu or Nitish ? But  how can a so called Hindu Hriday Samrat who feigns that he disbelieves in the caste system and batting for so-called Hindu unity adopt such third rate tactics totally alien to the ideology that he professes  ??  It is simply plain hypocrisy, double standards and cacophony of contradictions which can only be reconciled by the  brain dead Sanghis while targeting Nitish and Lalu for fomenting caste politics   !!</comment>

<comment>People do take selfies with monkeys & wild animals.</comment>

<comment>god save bihar and biharis from this joker....</comment>

<comment>first you save yourself from jealousy</comment>

<comment>People against reservation pose themselves as supporters of merit. Meritocracy is fine but when more than 80% of population is unprivileged that argument is a sham. People being poor is the result of an oppressive caste system practiced for a 1000 years. Now that reality can  be changed only by money and social status up gradation. That is a national commitment as the nation can prosper only when all can prosper.</comment>

<comment>The point is no good can EVER come out of murdering INDIVIDUAL rights for social, national good. Yudhistira was so so wrong when he told that an Individual can be sacrificed for family, a family for a city and city for a nation. THE ONLY WORK OF A GOVERNMENT IS PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS - JEFFERSON.USA has shown that only by protecting Individual rights creativity, invention can prosper. USA has been the source of all inventions, bulbs, to aeroplanes to computers to bio-techonology.With inequality but with freedom the cake would have grown bigger - now people have to fight like dogs because Individual rights of merit,  freedom has been murdered by reservation policy.My new idea: Either a society has equality or freedom but never BOTH. Why? In order that equality is enforced a strong state is required to do good and it strangles freedom. Very little of human[creativity etc] will be left after the state strangles freedom.</comment>

<comment>You have a point, but remember this when you fall seriously ill, don't try to locate a best doctor who has built up a reputation on his merit for treating you.You must encourage doctors who passed on quota system also by patronizing them.</comment>

<comment>Why not be honest and have a new category of degree -quota degree?</comment>

<comment>What abt poor upper castes?</comment>

<comment>It is a fatal flaw to grant justification for reservation policy by economic criteria for reservation. All reservations are murder of merit, an Individual right.My new idea: Either a society has equality or freedom but never BOTH. Why? In order that equality is enforced a strong state is required to do good and it strangles freedom. Very little of human[creativity etc] will be left after the state strangles freedom.</comment>

<comment>No I don't think reservations should be viewed in that way. Reservations should be viewed as a levelling factor to set those who are from underprivileged backgrounds an equal footing with those who had a head start. Basically can it is a form of providing equal opportunity. However this is meaningful only if reservation is limited to abt 25-30% at the entry level and is only for the truly deserving</comment>

<comment>MK Gandhi was a dead man long before he was killed. Any doubts? Try using his super human ideas in practical life. Anna became Gandhian after a suicide attempt.

<comment>Your viewpoint is false as if it were true great progress would have been achieved - reservation can only sow the seeds of civil  war. It does not expand the cake. 30 year old sri lankan conflict started with reservation policy. As India is big it takes a little more time for it to catch fire, than Sri lanka. Further murder of Individual right of merit is murderRead all my comments in this post</comment>

<comment>The answer is not reservations. Reservations only ensure spots for people, regardless of whether they are competent for those spots or not. Would you be comfortable going to a doctor or surgeon whom you knew was only able to enter medical school because of reservations, and not because of his actual marks/qualifications?The answer is to expand  solid, quality education to all sections of society. Make sure that equal opportunities are delivered to every single person, including the most backward communities. Make sure that everyone is equally trained and taught from childhood, in all schools in the country. Then, let survival of the fittest take over. Only the best will make it anywhere in India, and suddenly the quality of society and of life in general will soar drastically </comment>

<comment>Laloo is only a jokar. Good for nothing.</comment>

<comment>It will not be fair to blame one or two persons for spreading the poison of caste-ism,rather there are many culprits & sinners.These dirty elements have no heart,no love, no concern for humanity.Dirty politicians can go to any extent for achieving power & wealth.People need to be matured enough to understand the nefarious design of these anti social elements who spread hatred & ill feeling among people.Humanity is supreme religion & supreme caste.Now it is election time,people must reject all those candidates who play the caste or communal card,let them be from any party.People must elect candidates who are honest & strive for human values.People of Bihar have suffered a lot due to misrule of dirty politicians,else Bihar would have been the most developed state.Now people are matured enough,honest & able candidates will win.</comment>

<comment>Now India politics in Bihar is viewed as the competition between political parties which want people should not change and people should change! Politcal analysts also slice the politics into samparthaik (traditional caste/religion based) instead of bringing in innovation in it.Why Nitish ard Lalu are asking the audience about only  caste belief  in politics? Have they got guts to ask  questions against Reilgion based politics in the group of minorities? That will give a full answer to where our secularism exist.</comment>

<comment>Good news. When people will change,so will politics</comment>

<comment>I am amazed that in India, a convicted politician who cannot fight an election, nor take any elected post is allowed to lead an election campaign in the name of OBC empowerment! Anything goes and media too promotes him!!</comment>

Every firstpost comment section is filled with this commie, terrorist sympathizer, corrupt, thieving AAPtards AAPHoles. To all #aaptards, stop spamming firstpost, your Dhongriwal can keep trying for years, all he will ever win is a city like Delhi. Forget Punjab and stop dreaming about making him PM..wont happen ever period.</comment>

<comment>Sorry moditard, i know you would like to silence all free speech and bow to your little altar,but that is just not how it works.give modi time though,he will surely bring about his hindutva utopia</comment>

<comment>LOL !!!</comment>

<comment>Some use caste, some use religion, some even use food discrimination as a vote bank political tool.</comment>

<comment>Lalu uses all of them. Nitish too uses caste and religion.</comment>

<comment>BJP are the pioneers of all of them.which means all are the same.</comment>

<comment>Some use Jumla as well</comment>

<comment>Education and education led development will change the face of India. It is the educated youth who are slapping tightly on the face of Lalu Yadav for his caste politics. Politian’s in the past have NOT focused on the primary education; their main focus was only on higher education. As a result we still have so many uneducated, illiterate folks who still believe in caste politics. Educated youths are very demanding; the Politian’s who don’t deliver have to simply GO; they no longer can fool people…………I am looking a resurgent India who aspire for equity, jobs and development for better livelihood.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately even educated youth are still bowing to caste when it comes to what should be a personal choice of marriage partner.</comment>

<comment>What a strange story. Not to believe in caste is good. Caste is the problem with society in India. It is also the reason why parties like the BJP do not get votes unless they whip up mass hysteria</comment>

<comment>1)The point is political parties, state has emancipated themselves from democracy by the vehicle of reservation policy.That is because stable VOTE BANKS are formed.2)Every one suspected that the holy cow "farmer" was not having the highest suicide rate[ It works out to 0.0181 percent. It is clear, therefore, that the rate of general suicide is a full 3.6 times higher than the suicide rate among the so-called farmers. ].The system has therefore subverted itself because people havemoved away from the villages to towns, but relatively ADJUSTMENT in number ofMLA/MP seats has not taken place and there is relative disenfranchisement ofurban voters( the intelligent section). The system could not take correctiveaction as system is not a democracy(emancipation from democracy from point 1above). Inevitably mafia has captured parliament. That is why the excessivefocus on the holy cow "the farmer" - A fascist lie by all parties3)It is a sign of inefficient economy, driven by socialist principle. Again it underlines socialism whatever its intentions does NOT work. Economic efficiency[which HAS to include individual choice]has to dictate whateveryone should do.Solutions:1)URGENTLY make buying and selling of votes transparent and legal - it will once and for all shatter vote banks and finish off populism. Presently buying and selling of votes EXISTS and  is not transparent, and is concealed in ideology of populism like reservation policy and loan waivers.2)RSS has been plaing second fiddle to socialists - it is shirking its responsibility to educate people on immorality of socialism[read point 4 for details3)Free gun laws will be a game changer[and it will be extremely POPULAR as can be seen that Republicans in USA get large number of votes on this issue] - criminals will kill each other first. Capitalism, privatization is a must.4)Regarding Rahul Gandhi "Land bill is for corporates", Kiran Majumdhar Shaw, made a good point that Rahul Gandhi is dividing people - a charge made against BJP/RSS by seculars. The mother of all communalism was the schism created by Marx by his bourgeoisie and proleteriat. Gandhi Topis are communal in the extreme. They are inventing one communalism after another by inventing one holy cow after another - this time it is farmers. I want to catch hold of Lal Bhadur Shastri and ask him are other humans not humans, apart from Jawan and Kisan? In this process, raping economy[non-violent rape of economy!], Rupee has collapsed from Rs. 4 = 1 dollar in 1947 to Rs.74 = 1 dollar in 2013. If the same state of affairs continues rupee will sink to Rs.10000 = 1 dollar. Even the holy cow, farmers, are led into the paradise literally - India has become suicide capital of theworld. It is fashionable, for some to argue that ANY exchange rate is OK -forgetting that with a country with zero productivity will have an infinitelylow value of currency, say with respect to say Gold. Raping the economy doesnot pay - but that does not mean I support artificially support a fixedexchange rate. I am questioning CONTINUOUS devaluation in UNOFFICIAL exchange rate. Also gold should not be forgotten.Alsodevaluation against gold should not be forgotten. In 1947, 11.66 grams[tola] ofGold was Rs.103. That represents a 12 % devaluation annually. However assuming3% increase in volume of gold production increase every year - there has been9% devaluation every year. That is due to sin of legal robbery of socialism[asdistinct from charity]</comment>

<comment>Bihar's elections are undoubtedly important for the nation and Bihari's. A win for NDA will keep media mills and the "Keep India Poor" Congi and AAPtard gang at bay for quite some time. A loss would on the other hand make things very difficult for NDA. I just hope Bihari's vote in huge numbers using their own views, rather than be driven by drama's that are fed to them.</comment>

<comment>Why should a loss in Bihar for NDA make things difficult for them ? This idea is being promoted by the pseudo secular English Media in alliance with the opposition because their very existence is at stake. A second term for Modi will be the death knell for the looters of India.</comment>

<comment>Its just a sentiment game. A cautious, strong and focused approach will ensure NDA sweeps the Bihar elections. A victory will push the media crooks and fringe players like Lalu and Nitish to the walls. That is what I intended to mention.</comment>

<comment>I have my SERIOUS doubts if people believe you. The inflation is going in negative which means prices of all the commodities are going down; things are becoming cheaper.PS: The average inflation rate during (2007-2012) eleventh five year plan under so called great economist Dr. Manmohan was 7.4 percent which is the SECOND highest since our independence.</comment>

<comment>LOL, aap not fighting in Bihar, we know that aapturd..but kejriwal already shared the stage more than once with nitish and supports the odious alliance of nitish, lalu and congress and more to the point, has already spent over fifty crore rupees of delhi development funds campaigning for this group..that explains it all, aapturd</comment>

<comment>A very apt, valid and relevant response from the sensible Bihari audience. Lalu still living in yesteryears, has not recognised that India has moved on and this will be the reason for his downfall, probably RJD time is limited and it seams that RJD will be wiped off the face of Indian politics.</comment>

<comment>Hang on...who is in charge of garbage in Delhi? ...who?  I can't hear you,speak up</comment>

<comment>LOL moron, had you taken the time to do the research or for that matter, even read the news, you would know that kejriwal the langur stopped paying salaries of the corporation workers, and four months of non payment, the workers naturally went o a strike. You may believe in working for free but these guys have families and were justified for striking, more so the high court rapped kejriwal on the knuckles and told him to pay up and he did..That's the whole story so next time before you blather on, take the time to do the research aapturd..not that we expect much from you lot. BTW, kejriwal falls flat on his face again, gets wiped out in DU election..nice.</comment>

<comment>AAP's Punjab story : 4 MP's. 2 kicked out, 1 on the way out, 1 hanging with thread. This is how Khujli plans to expand in Punjab ? You are a true AAPtard. Remember, sticking a broom up your a** does not make you a peacock.</comment>

<comment>Sorry what?? Nitish a development man? You would need to transport yourself to an alternate dimension for that to be even partly true. And should you vote for nitish, you are dooming Bihar all over again, for one of the most corrupt, odious alliances in all of bihar happens to be that of nitish, lalu and congress..</comment>

<comment>LOL, feel free to be as deluded as you would like to be but don't ask us to get on the insanity train called lalu nitish express to nowhere, EVER..we want Bihar to be developed and know fully well that it WILL GO TO THE DOGS should nitish, by a miracle, end up becoming the cm again. Thank god the possibility of that happening is slim to none..</comment>

<comment>Modi believes in the development of his suit and his travel portfolio </comment>

<comment>And that's why all aapturds are morons, for proof, see above..one of the resident aapturd's white paper on what he thinks of everything..</comment>

<comment>Then you will be a proxy voter of Lalu too. And Lalu and development poles apart.</comment>

<comment>That's your counter?? Seriously? That you hate pappu and giriraj? Just one quick rebut, the other side does not consist of either of these two..giriraj is a lunatic who has long been sidelined and as for pappu, he is on shaky grounds, both legally and with any party he allies with and cannot do anything more than say "meow"..all said and done, voting for lalu and nitish, is to welcoming herpes along with gonorrhea and doing the tango with it all over your body..</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>In other words, you do not have any counter at all and are getting increasingly desperate..GOOD, you should be worried, very worried that your balwass leader is going to lose big..</comment>

<comment>Where are AAPCON members? Why are they not protecting Lalu? Oh wait...they are on NDTV posting negative comments on Modi!</comment>

<comment>LOL well said and FYI, it is no longer ndtv, but aaptv..</comment>

<comment>LALOO & NITISH are symbol of EVILONE IS SUPER CASTEIST , who never hesitate to divide society and create havoc in country for his own benefitWhileOther is biggest opportunist and can do anything for his lust of CHAIR, even call terrorist his daughter.</comment>

<comment>Lalu destroyed Congress rule, now next is Nitish, who is counting his days.</comment>

<comment>Lalu's speach shows that Bihar will be safer, better, progressive under BJP.  Lalu has not apologised or returned corrupt fodder money of hungry cows.</comment>

<comment>The explanation that he gave to the CBI in the fodder case, is one for the books. As rumors go, when the CBI knocked down o lalu's door, along with ED, asking for an explanation for the seven to nine hundred crores of money and receipts, it seems that lalu took them to his farm and showed them his cows..as for the explanation, the cows ate it all, this cow ate so much, gave birth to more cows and they in turn ate more..Not kidding..no on in their right mind would vote for the nitish, lalu and congress combine, EVER..</comment>

<comment>Just like when SIT was asking Feku Modi about his role in the riots, all of Modi's answers were that he did not remember what happened as if he had Alzhiemers. The only thing that saved Modi was that he has cunning enough to destroy all the evidence (cdr's etc) and bribe or intimidate witnesses which caused the SIT to give a final report that there is " Not enough prosecutable evidence against him". Even though the Amicus Curae asked the SC to file charges against him the SC felt otherwise. This is what the RSS Chaddis call a "clean chit".</comment>

<comment>Lalu's fears are coming true. People are getting educated and no longer buying his plans of letting bihar stay underdeveloped.</comment>

<comment>Typical scumbag politician trying to get into the heads of youngsters and pump victimhood into their brain.  He wants to convince them "you are a victim" so blame all the problems on others.  This is exactly what Muslim apologists also keep telling the global muslim communites "you are the victims of the western nations, victims at the hands of the Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists.  Pumping victimhood propaganda is now a big political business.</comment>

<comment>Could not have put the facts on the table any better !! Victimization is often used as a tool by the media mills and politicians.</comment>

<comment>There are not too many taker of Lallu's views as people now know that he is convicted corrupt man. People go to the meeting of this joker because they like to watch him perform stupidity!</comment>

<comment>LoL what a joker!</comment>

<comment>Tathagata is a name of Lord Buddha who was never fixated with small things of life, preached peace, took the middle path. You are fixated with Kejriwal all the times I have seen you on social media. Leave him to his work, and let his voters decide periodically whether he is doing good work or not. Assembly results we know. Now the DUSU results will be out tomorrow. Then Corporation one year later. So why worry! Buddham sharanam gachhami.</comment>

<comment>hahaha</comment>

<comment>Modi is OBC so we patel will never vote for OBC </comment>

<comment>Sab mile hue hain jee</comment>

<comment>LOL, It is fun to see these aapturds getting frantic and all worked up, at the very thought of their beloved bakwass leader kejriwal and the maggot ridden corrupt coalition - insert congress, lalu and nitish - lose heavily in Bihar..Dear Khulji, froth away but just so you know, while these residents aapturds are more than happy to remain demented, insane and post moronic comments - we see you for what you are, a useless and good for nothing CM who has not delivered on a single promise to date. FYI, announcements are not delivering on promises, you need to do actual work, so when do you plan to work as the cm and deliver on the various promises you made to us?Will you ever deliver on anything at all? We don't think so..so feel free to jerk yourself off as much as you like, but the only customers you will get to that kind of the show would be the aapturds and as for us,, sane indians, we ain't buying your crap, NOT NOW, NOT EVER..</comment>

<comment>Why in love with Kejriwal so much? Discussion is on Lalu here. The more you love AK he seems to be gaining ground even more thanks to friends like you. The Delhi Univ results are out tomorrow, and you will know it once again.</comment>

<comment>Getting frantic, prof? BTW, the reason kejriwal is mentioned, and in such terms is on account of the fact that he and aap threw out the anti corruption plank right out of the window for power..right along with his principles. This is why that langur kejriwal and aap supported and still do support one of the most corrupt opportunistic alliances in Bihar to date, namely that of congress, lalu and Nitish.Furthermore, kejriwal and aap had already spent over fifty crores of delhi development funds to campaign in bihar for this alliance, need I even say more? That's why kejriwal is mentioned, each time the topic of bihar comes up or that of nitish, lalu..you get the idea.And what the heck do DU results have to do with how aap and kejrwal is perceived as..as complete "good for nothing's"..more to the point, so many aapturds went around claiming that nitish was going to win in Bihar because of kejriwal..either way, we would much rather wait for Bihar results to blacken the face of kejriwal rather than just du results..</comment>

<comment>No where has AAP supported Lalu, Kejriwal has been seen appreciating Nitish governance. A state govt cannot spend in another state and there is CAG to prevent that. If you are less informed do no spread your ignorance. Bihar results have nothing to do with AAP, Punjab results are as they are a force there. And your language shows your culture, which unfortunately, you will never realize. Does a drunkard ever find anything wrong with rampant drinking?</comment>

<comment>LOL, back pedalling much prof?? Hare, I do not even need to state this out here, just google for kejriwal's one quotes about how aap will support and campaign for Nitish, lalu and congress in Bihar and he has done that. More to the point, he used our money, meant for delhi's development to do just that..And FYI, you were the one who asked us to wait for DU results and now, the results are out prof..and it seems that aap and kejriwal the langur have fallen flat on their collective faces. Anything to add to that or are you planning to sulk like Bhagoda?And state gov may not spend its development funds on another state but that has not stopped kejriwal, has it? He not only used five hundred and odd crores, earmarked for delhi's development for moronic ads glorifying himself, he spent an additional fifty crores of our money to campaign for nitish, lalu and congress in Bihar. I suggest you make a beeline for your base camp or as we call it, the langur headquarters, and ask kejriwal some pointed questions.Bottom line: The people of delhi have woken up and have seen the langur kejriwal for who he is, a megalomaniac who would even give the likes of Hitler and stalin a run for their money. And the DU results are just the beginning of the end, do see the writing on the wall and call us when reality bites you aapturds on the "you know what"..</comment>

<comment>I am glad you did not mention the DUSU result which you had been harping all the while. Updated yourself, I guess.  And going by your convulated logic it is ok to support a guy who in turn is supporting a scam accused as long as you don't support the scamster directly. Are you really a Prof? Going by your logic you would be classified as a moron and of course you would not realise you are one because you are a moron. That really sounded nice I'd say.</comment>

<comment>We should do dharna so that Modiji fulfils his promise of removing Vadra's no-frisking priveleges at airports</comment>

<comment>bc baat Laloo ki ho rhi hai aur in bhadwon ko Vadra yaad aa rha hai..aise slave hai y bkl</comment>

<comment>AAP has installed AC in all gov school but media r not showing hahaha</comment>

<comment>Fibbing already?? But then again, for you aapturds that's the norm, right? Pathetic..and fyi, the article is about lalu, and the fact that the aap supported congress lalu nitish combine is set to lose heavily in Bihar..Guess kejriwal is only good for nautaks and entertainment value, NOTHING MORE.. .pffft</comment>
