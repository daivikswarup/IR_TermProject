<comment>XYZ se azadi, ABC se azadi, .. on and on their screaming goesThe chanters don't realize when in their narcissim's throes"Azadi se Azadi, Azadi se Azadi", they have begun to shoutAnd we send in the police to bring just that about.</comment>

<comment>JNU sick minds are depicting Devi Durga as a prostitute and they are lauded as champions of free speech, but a guy in UP told truth about the prophet and he is in jail.</comment>

<comment>Again you bring in religion in a very civilised debate of whether this is sedition or not. Please read the article and then comment ...Dont just randomly cook up stories in your mind and then blog</comment>

<comment>Dear FP Staff, have u have not uploaded full pages of the Status Report? Why r u selective?</comment>

<comment>For Delhi Police one can only say " Jagira ko bhaya, kutta kaat khaya"</comment>

<comment>BJP should not have been “conservative” in the bad sense of the word. It should have been imaginative and made SEDITIOUS SPEECH A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. The logically the only punishment for hot  air is cold air – that is when the person works in a MNC in a AC room. The problem with BJP is it wants to be congress+cow as Arun Shourie puts it.=========================================================Congress government did not ratifiy [made into laws] 1988 United Nations resolution on Torture. It shares august company of states such as Sudan and North Korea. Rajan was tortured, killed and his dead body was fed to pigs during emergencySeveral provisions within the Indian Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and various national security related laws provide immunity to these officials. Section 197 of the CrPC allows for all-encompassing immunity by providing that the Central or state government in question must grant sanction for the prosecution of any government official … alleged to have committed a criminal offence “while acting or purporting to act within the discharge of his official duty.” The Supreme Court has upheld this provision and has stated that even those who abuse their power are considered to be “acting or purporting to act” in their official position and thus enjoy immunity.=================================================================Government Brahmins[supporters and beneficiaries of reservation policy] are cannibals of merit. Indian state tutors them to NOT see that reservation policy caste certificate holders who murder merit practice cannibalistic culture. The problem is no Nation practicing cannibalism human sacrifice can be a democracy! Bureaucratic Indian state, still follows the laws of British Bureaucracy.Lack of free speech [sedition laws]and reservation policy was promoted and encouraged by British Bureaucracy which saw to it that Indian share of GDP fell from 28% after East India Company's rule to 3%. Brahmins are modern dalits who are sold by the Indian bureaucracy - they even have a plan to bring in reservation in private sector.What is the secret that BJP/Congress policy are always similar. That is because after having both parties call each other anti-national, the moot question remains WHO IS THE NATION? Why are parties subservient to it? NATION  is the Indian bureaucracy, which maintains its power by INTELLIGENT rigging[read indiaevm . org elections by Electronic Voting Machines]. It is the same bureaucracy which makes ease of doing business and nations progress very very low. Unfortunately Modi trusts in the same bureaucracy================================================================Emergency and socialist congress terrorists hoisting national flag in RSS office?. Actually it became Indira Gandhi's flag after emergency. Congress chief's Barooah words still vibrant "India is Indira and Indira is India" - then it must be true of National flag as well. Socialism[legal robbery] introduced into constitution during emergency HAS to lead to single party [single family in India] dictatorship.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interestingly the Topiwallah Khejriwal does not speak of free speech1)If cannibalism and human sacrifice is practiced in a country can it be democratic?2)Simply voting does not make a Nation democratic. India was and is a Ocholocracy [mob rule] because by definition Individual rights like merit is murdered by reservation policy and Individual rights like property rights was murdered by socialism [legal robbery]. Along with voting Individual [smallest minority ] rights should be protected.3)Interestingly socialism was introduced into constitution by Indira Gandhi, CPI and KGB during emergency. Lack of free speech and  reservation policy was promoted and encouraged by British Bureaucracy which saw to it that Indian share of GDP fell from 28% after East India Company's rule to 3%. Like all governments it was inefficient spend thrift and became bankrupt. Laws should be made guaranteeing free speech, BECAUSE India should not be backward. The old colonial law restricting free speech IS anti-national-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BJP [See Khattar’s statement]is anti National as it wants to give reservations to Jats at the expense of merit seats without disturbing OBC Quota. BJP is anti-national. What MORAL right does left have to function in a multi party democracy when they are for single party dictatorship? Have left students forgotten Polpot Stalin who crushed INDIVIDUALS for building collective? Left is anti-human. Why was communist parties not banned. Kanhaiya Kumar, member of CPI, INDIVIDUALLY  can be forgiven because communist parties were not banned.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What if the state is captured by a mob? India is a Ocholocracy [mob rule] as Individual rights( like merit) is murdered, by definition, as by reservation policy and Individual right of property rights are murdered by Socialism. Will you call Jats who destroyed an entire state as anti-National? Will you call kapus anti-National as they burnt a train. Reservation agitation is action as compared to just hot air of sloganeering [logically punishment should also be hot air]. VP Singh has made constitution anti-national and Modi I suspect will bring private sector reservations to become another VP Singh----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------No Support to Khalid. Kanhaiya Kumar is different as he is not a member of communist Democratic Students Union which is for the murder of Individual rights and is for collectivism. Communists support reservation policy, which is murder of Individual right of merit and also are for demolishing property rights another important Individual right.Kanhaiya Kumar as PM!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------However Let us examine Sedition laws------------------------------------1)Law of Vikamaditya: A prostitute hears a Brahmin who says to his friend that she had appeared in the Brahmins man's dreams and she was wonderful. The Prostitute drags the Brahmin to Vikramaditya for her fees. Vikramaditya hangs a bag of Gold and asks the prostitute to get her fees from the MIRROR. If service is virtual reward is also virtual. In sedition laws if the 'crime' is talking then the punishment should also be 'talking'2)USA Laws protect a person who burns the National Flag as the crime is CONSIDERED virtual and is not action. State acts when the 'crime' is in action3)In Kedar Nath Singh’s Case, 5 judges of the Supreme Court – a Constitution bench – made it clear that allegedly seditious speech and expression may be punished only if the speech is an ‘incitement’ to ‘violence’, or ‘public disorder’. Subsequent cases have further clarified the meaning of this phrase. In Indra Das v. State of Assam and Arup Bhuyan v. State of Assam, the Supreme Court unambiguously stated that only speech that amounts to “incitement to imminent lawless action” can be criminalised.There is a flaw in the LOGIC  of supreme court. How can an INDIVIDUAL be punished for the actions of the mob - particularly when India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] as the reservation policy agitation of Kapus and Jats showed. IS IT THE FAULT OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAT INDIA HAS BECOME EXPLOSIVE? HOW SHOULD THE INDIVIDUAL KNOW IN ADVANCE if a situation will explode? The faulty logic of mixed economy[read article on mixed economy down below] and acts of VP Singh, which made the constitution anti-National. Indira Gandhi has made the constitution anti-national by inserting socialism[as by definition legal robbery, as distinct from charity and implies forceful SNATCHING]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arun SHourie put the problem in two words Present BJP govt is congress+cow. He implied Modi has been a failure. Failed persons in politics can be dangerous. I strongly suspect that he will try to bring in private sector reservations and try to become another VP SIngh, who made the constitution anti-national along with Indira Gandhi when she inserted legal robbery of socialism into constitution.--------------------------------------------------------------------The solution is to test PM on the basis of  MERIT. He has not been proactive. I had recommended, earlier:Now BJP/RSS should be creative, PROACTIVE, and bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics. USA experience shows that goons kill each other in presence of free gun laws. None will kill with a legal weapon.2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=========================================================Mixed economy is a fascist economy. Bureaucracy/mafia politician becomes the supreme arbiter. Consider reservation policy: The only work of a government is protection of Individual rights - Jefferson, 2nd president of USA.. President of India as head of state has to commit suicide as merit, an Individual right, is murdered by reservation policy. The state is duty bound to protect Individual from mobs. Such arguments are not answered but ignored -- what the state does is right. Nazism was stateism like socialism. Those who could obtain power could justify state-sponsored murder and plunder by pointing out that since morals don't really exist and are merely a product of one's class or upbringing, there is no moral argument against the state version of murder and plunder.Socialism introduced into constitution during emergency is legal robbery. Way forward is capitalism[another name of freedom]Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim’s gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of money taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials and mafia politicians.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, but that it cannot be used honestly.Why does not the state allot a seat strictly on merit and snatch it away OPENLY?Gandhian Socialism of BJP is Gandhiism [selling of ones supporters to gain support of Jinnah and Muslims and Socialism is legal robbery]</comment>

<comment>Looks like each and every TOM, DICK and NDTV wants a say in this case, We are tired of hearing too many experts who say sloganeering is not sedition, Well it is very much sedition as per the section,  take your time, have a deep breath and read IPC. IPC bare act is available for Rs.20-25 in any decent book shop. But who reads anyway?. The scolars gaining fat on national funds in JNU does not have any idea what Constitution is?. I remember an incident when I was in law college, We went to conduct a legal service camp in a far off village. Our professor, a  constitutional expert, gave a huge explanation to the gathered locals about Fundamental Rights, Especially rights of a person arrested and all that. ONe young man sitting and listening very seriously actually stood up in a thrilling mood and asked "Babuji Yeh to bahut badiya hai. Yeh Samvidhan kahan milega, Mujhe yahi chiye. Paise ka parva nahi, Ghar bhi girvi rakhunga, akhir is se hum bach to javoge".  Well those experts on TV too look much similar to that poor young man who was thrilled to hear about Constitution.Now I did hear a lot of shocking observation on tv. A professor who says His University has a flag and does not need National Flag, since National Flag will interfere with his autonomy, A lady who tells "National Flag is about Hindus", and what else. Everyone comes to the show with a ready to serve speech and I have to admit I did enjoy Arnab actually not letting those bafoons to have their malicious stuff to be vomited on his TV.</comment>

<comment>Sir what would u say about ppl who r describing devi Durga as prostitute? Such sick minded are the JNU guys</comment>

<comment>Is there any surprise on that?. Those who wants to cut their Motherland into pieces will insult  mother, even if it is thier own mother. So I'am not surprised to hear that...</comment>

<comment>Sir, Please dont go by word of mouth, Thats how you spread rumours</comment>

<comment>Looks like you watched 2-3 arnab debates at once an then finally logged into fpost....first you talk of ipc then fundamental rights then national flag...what's ur point....speak on the article</comment>

<comment>Well I watched both sides, The Leftists simply got it wrong this time around, Why not admit that the Left leaning thugs who does not have any responsibility to the Nation and wants all RIGHTS is simply being sidelined on everything in the Country. Their last standoff also went miserably wrong.As for your problem with the article. Has this writer or any of his accompliece ever attended a court trial in full?. They will know the Delhi police "Report" WAS IN FACT THEIR LIST OF OBJECTIONS, on the bail application. There is no question of having full proof or evidence during a Bail hearing. IT is not even possible. Delhi police achieved what they wanted with their counter statement. Well just pointing out that leftists with only rhetoric and hooliganism is causing their "Kanaiyya" more harm than he needs now and that is squarely because of something which looks like plain arrogance and ignorance. If things go this way the accused will find it more difficult as investigation goes by. Now see how fast those so called knights of "AZHADI" succumb, especially when Police gets their way of confronting all of them with others answers on interrogation.</comment>

<comment>See now this is what happens when you watch too much ARNAB, you start speaking ABSURD</comment>

<comment>What is absurd, Can't you see the courts are all dismissing the Bail application and the so-called students are being sent to police custody. So Delhi police simply beat their interference plans. See how they tired up the opposition and failed their plans to create loud voices for students suffering police thing in JNU. How the Delhi police acted throughout this case was excellent and very very professional. They in fact shifted the pressure on anti-nationals and see how they are whimpering now, things like he did not say that, the other guys sadi that etc. Inf act before police got involved all of us saw the same fellas shouting on TV with arrogant voices and arguing that it is their "FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION". Now they find it was their "doom", So they simply go and beg for sympathy. The whole opposition has been on back-foot. The very things  they said are being held against them all over the country. The TV channels which were always insulting this country and especially parroting the British Missionary hate speeches of 18th and 19th centuries to convert Hindus, are not selling now. One TV channel blacked out itself, because no one except some anti-national sympathisers does not watch it any more. And what is more 9/10 of Indians want action and control for every University in India. They simply say they does not want their kids to be indoctrinated. They sent their kids to study and not fight anyway. Only Commies and terrorists think they are living to fight and kill and destabilise Nations, Others live to enjoy life and to serve humanity. </comment>

<comment>I am all for the national flag flying over our institutions from that very day, NOT a SINGLE religious symbol should be allowed in there. Not the Sanghi flag, no RSS uniforms, no Sanghi or other religious posters ... I am sure the Bhakts will throw the national flag into the gutter if this were to be the rule. So much for their love for the national flag. And I am pleased to meet someone who thinks that his reading of the IPC'd provisions on sedition are superior to learned judgments of India's highest courts. Well, not surprising, because Sanghis nowadays are taught to think of themselves as owners of this country.</comment>

<comment>Is anybody booked from Zee Television for airing a cooked-up-video?What happened to those hooligans, who in the disguise of lawers took law in their hands at Patiala Court?What happened to those security personnel, who instead of stopping these hooligans remained mere spectators?</comment>

<comment>Morons like you could not prove so called video was actually cooked up.</comment>

<comment>Understand that the video was actually cooked up based on which sedition charges were labelled on wrong fellows. The way the matter was handled is questionable. Truth will anyway unfold in coming days. I have full faith in democracy and our judiciary.</comment>

<comment>We'll leave the proving of anti india slogans to chanakyas like you</comment>

<comment>no need... hear Smriti Irani's speech - enough to send these boogeroos to kala paani</comment>

<comment>You can hide behind her, coz she's huge enough to cover all bhakts, but there is nothing to prove kanhaiya has raised those slogans</comment>

<comment>clear you are not listening - just seeing her size. She presented info - signed affidavits, posters and such (apart from videos) - that is how people are nailed in Indian courts (and bureaucracy). Next all 3 idiots in custody right now will be providing testimonies against each other. These are mostly upper middle class totays - you will hear them sing soon enough.</comment>

<comment>Err.. the evidence is in the video</comment>

<comment>Err... the video has proven to be doctored!</comment>

<comment>Err.. by our resident forensic experts Rahul Kanwal & Barkha dutt.</comment>

<comment>Mediocrity all over... Basically the BJP is mostly mediocre. Supporters make a lot of noise but get squat except a way to vent their frustrations, and some rich industrialists get away making a lot of money. Well deserved all around. </comment>

<comment>So mediocrity is thinking for oneself and excellence is being brainwashed by jehadis and maoists and saying "India ki barbadi"</comment>

<comment>Your opinion. And aren't you making a lot of noise and spreading lies the same thing you blame others? Mediocrity at the best I see from you</comment>

<comment>Don't know if you can judge mediocrity with one post - you could have called me other things - opinionated, perhaps.Just watch what many of the BJP leaders do and say. Take Jaitley for instance - compare him to MMS and Chidambaram. Congress may have been corrupt to the core, but atleast they had more competent people in many portfolios. But they didn't command a majority like the BJP does. Seems BJP just mostly has angry mediocre people.Probably Amit Shah is one of those few truly competent people in BJP.  They should have kept some of their senior leaders around atleast for continuity.</comment>

<comment>If you are opinionated perhaps base your opinion on facts not on noise created by media.Cannot compare Jaitley to MMS but to Chidambaram. Chiddu I was the most arrogant failure who could have taken India to growth rate of 7% or more. Instead UPA2 growth came down significantly. Chiddu looted more than 1 lac crores which is managed by his son Kartick. just because you are qualified does not make you a good administrator. Instead he was a looter. How can you even think of comparing a Democratic Party like BJP with a single family hijacked party who are even ready to make a foreigner fundamentalist Christian spy as their messiah. Do you know that Sonia as an Italian Citizen stayed in TOP Secret PM house for 15 years? Can you go and stay as a foreigner in White House?Now let's compare Chiddu as HM and MMS as PM. List total respect for MMS when he let the nation looted. MMS practically surrendered as if he was the whipping boy of Sonia. And what is the qualification of Sonia that you make her the head of NAC that overruled everyone? She was running the country I meant looting the country. While the world was developing BRICS was shining India didn't shine as much as much as others. Today only India in BRICS is doing far better than others while B R C S are going through recessionary signs.Do you know as an HM Chiddu went after with MMS and Sonia after CBI to nail a CM they even went to the extent of showing Israt Jahan was an innocent girl which in fact she was an single terrorist cell roaming with married Pakistani LeT operatives. I am glad they were killed by IB and Gujarat Police.Now let's talk about ministers and portfolio. Do you know Anthony practically made India very vulnerable and thank god we have people like Manohar who are rebuilding the defense. We have people like Suresh Prabhu who has to bring back railways on track ( no pun intended) we have Gadkari who has started again rebuilding the highways which came to a grinding halt. And the education system was so corrupted that you had Kapil Sibal who hired Teesta Stelvad to write our text books glorifying the looters and pirates of Middle East Moguls and how Britishers were far better Masters. Thank god this also needs to be stopped. I would rather be a nationalist than a terrorist. </comment>

<comment>At least they are not asking for our barbaadi or describing our goddess as a prostitute like the JNU guys, thats the mark of excellence right?</comment>

Backed by RSS, they just want the conservative right wing ideology to spread throught India starting from the universities which are the temples of knowledge. Rest are all excuses.</comment>

<comment>There are reports that some news agencies, politicians, etc. are trying to weaken India.

<comment>Stupid article posted just to justify that Grammar is more important than national interests!!Dear FAKEPost- All the anti-nationals including media, are now very well-known to all the Sensible Indian citizens.Now you can easily tell us WHO is your boss abroad or inside, transfers hefty amount of perks in your account to always post negative comments about any postive steps taken by the present Indian Government?</comment>

<comment>Positive steps...to put wrong sedition charges on students...?? do you even know what your talking...you think the boss abroad cares about what's going. In india...they care a shit about this place.  Infact all they care is indians taking away their jobs</comment>

<comment>The quality of this Police report goes to the heart of the problem with this Government. With an ill-educated Prime Minister, fake-degree Education Minister and clueless Home Minister, everything has to pass through Arun Jaitley's hands to make it even decently presentable. No wonder Jaitley is unable to manage his own ministries.</comment>

<comment>Wanted to share this nice article, which i read today. Very well articulated and highly relevant to what is happening.“The difference between a nationalist and a patriot is the difference between believing your country is great, and can do no wrong; and believing that your country is great, but not perfect. Nationalism asks you to be blind to the bad aspects, and to believe your country is without fault. True patriotism is loving your country , while also criticising the things that are imperfect and considering the ways it could be greater."epaperbeta.timesofindia(dot)com/index.aspx?eid=31809&dt=20160225#</comment>

<comment>you guys guys read this if u think these JNU students are actually studentsMahishasur Martyrdom DayDurga Puja is the most controversial racial festival, where a fair-skinned beautiful goddess Durga is depicted brutally killing a dark-skinned native called Mahishasur. Mahishasur, a brave self-respecting leader, tricked into marriage by Aryans. They hired a sex worker called Durga, who enticed Mahishasur into marriage and killed him after nine nights of honeymooning during sleep.this was posted on on JNU campus on October 4, 2014is this education or cultural in any way !!!!</comment>

<comment>What do you expect lower caste to make of all these hindu godess and gods who claimed that they were untouchable and lower castes..they should never ever get education, if they do then lead should be poured in their ears.</comment>

<comment>All irrespective of caste prey to her. Only the JNU sick minds propagate such vulgarity and lie about "mahisasur" being lower caste to reap political benefit. They will sell their mother for gain. Well they r already selling Bharat mata I guess</comment>

<comment>Perhaps this reporter gives more importance to grammar than to National Security. Shame Shame to those who SUPPORT SUCH ACTIVITIES. You must learn  Grammar of the Nation. Your article is full of errors and lack of National feelings.</comment>

<comment>HOW MANY IPS OFFICERS APPLIED FULL & FINAL SETTLEMENT OF IPC IN THIS CASE? LET US SEE THE RESULT.</comment>

<comment>I sometime feel BJP mastermind Amit Shah is behind all this. They have created so much mess and now they have 90% of India on their side supporting GOVT on this issue. And Headless Rahul fell into trap supporting on wrong side. Any common man (other than politicials) who love India will be on govt side. I dont want this to be the truth because no-one should play with our Mother India --Jai Hind</comment>

<comment>Corrigendum : 90% of BJP/RSS not India!</comment>

<comment>where did you get the funny idea that 90% of India is supporting govt on this issue?</comment>

<comment>I think the number of Government supporter on this are less than 30 percent. I cannot see 70 % lower caste supporting them beating of Khaniya  and police turning on their people. The supporters are very vocal and use filthy abuses.</comment>

<comment>this is not about caste or religion. Majority of Indians are against this kind of hate politics and this is exactly why, despite a decent job, Mr Vajpayee's govt was voted out in 2004.</comment>

<comment>This is a class war, if Khaniya was from Brahmin family he would never ever be beaten for three hours mercilessly and cruelly  till he pied in this pants. This very definitely class war.</comment>

<comment>One of them is belong to brahmin family don't play cast card</comment>

<comment>Whole India plays caste cards and you pretend there is no caste in India...very funny and stupid.</comment>

<comment>I sometime feel why there are so many idiots surfacing in the country</comment>

<comment>If Iam a Idiot then what to call Rahul, Khaniya Kumar, Khalid and co?</comment>

<comment>You will know very soon when they are out cause of lack of evidence</comment>

<comment>Lawyers who took law in their hands should lose the license to practice and police who enabled the lawyers to beat Khaniya should lose their jobs.</comment>

<comment>Will act as deterrent for others, I support this.</comment>

<comment>Majority of the hard core BJP followers call names and use extremely filthy language and then they blame Khaniya for bad slogans.</comment>

<comment>FakePort, raNDTV, India today crossed the line in JNU Row reporting</comment>

<comment>I sometime feel BJP mastermind Amit Shah is behind all this. They have created so much mess and now they have 90% of India on their side supporting GOVT on this issue.

<comment>"दंड प्रसास्ति प्रजा" It is a sanskirat shlok I learned around 7-8th standard, Today it seems so true and live.It means Any Govt. and King don't rule the kingdom, Only "Punishment system" rules the kingdom.India has a very weak and useless punishment system.Our bodies had been got freedom before 60 years ago...

<comment>Government Brahmins[supporters of reservation policy] are cannibals of merit. Indian state tutors them to NOT see that reservation policy caste certificate holders who murder merit practice cannibalistic culture. The problem is no Nation practicing cannibalism human sacrifice can be a democracy! Bureaucratic Indian state, still follows the laws of British Bureaucracy.Lack of free speech [sedition laws]and reservation policy was promoted and encouraged by British Bureaucracy which saw to it that Indian share of GDP fell from 28% after East India Company's rule to 3%. Brahmins are modern dalits who are sold by the Indian bureaucracy - they even have a plan to bring in reservation in private sector.What is the secret that BJP/Congress policy are always similar. That is because after having both parties call each other anti-national, the moot question remains WHO IS THE NATION? Why are parties subservient to it? NATION  is the Indian bureaucracy, which maintains its power by INTELLIGENT rigging[read indiaevm . org elections by Electronic Voting Machines]. It is the same bureaucracy which makes ease of doing business and nations progress very very low. Unfortunately Modi trusts in the same bureaucracy</comment>

<comment>I must say one thing Anti Indians should not be allowed to live in India. either they should be encountered or should be banished from India. They don't have rights to live in India.

Or do I claim to be a victim of my circumstances and say that I am married to a micro-minority family. I am a woman, and hence you did not allow me to speak in this House. Do not play politics with me.Those seeking response on an issue are specifically the ones who ask for personal favours, for example, to get their kids' admission in Kendriya Vidyalaya.Congress leader V Hanumantha Rao had written a letter, saying that there is a need for justice in Hyderabad University. He said that it was under the rule of the vice chancellor, which was appointed by the UPA government where Dalit students were committing suicide. Rao had urged me to take action and launch a probe.As soon as I got the news of Rohith Vemula's suicide, I called KCR [chief minister of Telangana], only to plead that the law and order situation should be under control. I was told, "Sir is busy right now." I never issued a public statement against the chief minister thinking that he will call back, but he never called back. But I have a call record. I even spoke to his daughter.I issued several letters in reply to Rao's letters. An idea has been created that the HRD minister responds only to government ministers. I have always tried to resolve issues irrespective of the complainant's caste, creed or religion.I am not going to apologise for doing my duty. If you want to leave, you may do so. You never wanted to listen to my response, you never had the intention to do so.You don't have the courage to listen to what I have to say. You just want to do your politics. Listen to what I have to say, if you have the courage to do so.Asaduddin Owaisi and I are political opponents. He had once written a letter to me, I responded to it accordingly. Am I being condemned only because my department had issued a letter? I was just doing my duty.Oomen Chandy, Shashi Tharoor also sent letters to me, and we responded immediately. Today, I am being accused of discrimination? Even I can do the same.Political parties are busy trying to use the death of a child [Rohith Vemula] as a political weapon. The committee which suspended Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula was not constituted by our government, but by the UPA regime.I looked at the case as the death of a child and not as a death of a Dalit.My name is Smriti Irani. I challenge you to identify my caste.I am enraged by the manner in which a child's death (Rohith Vemula) is being used as a political weapon.I am taking it personally. I'll tell you how the entire incident has been used as a political tool.According to a report submitted to the Telangana high court, the police had reached Rohith's hospital at 7:20 pm when they found the body. The police said that when they reached the hostel, they found the room open and the dead body was on the table. A hand written suicide note was found. The suicide note that was left behind does not blame anyone.This is not my submission. This is what the police said. No one allowed a doctor near this child, to revive this child. Instead, his body was used as a political tool. No police was allowed till 6:30 am the following morning. Who tried to help this child?The ones who passed judgement are not the ones appointed by the BLP-led NDA but by the Congress party.Rahul Gandhi made the most of the opportunity and visited the hostel twice, something which he had never done before. Have you ever seen him visiting the same place twice? Did he do the same when 600 students died in the Telangana movement? Rohith blamed no one, yet Rahul tried to use this child as a political tool. The child in his suicide note said that no one is responsible for my death, yet you seek to use this child for your own political ends. That is the tragedy. The people who espouse the cause of free speech and attack this government, who say we are anti-minority, anti-Dalit, anti-tribal and time and again, they've been requested to not make it 'us against them'. I am not certifying your patriotism, but do not demean mine. I am not certifying your idea of India, but do not demean mine. To them I say this. Madam speaker, this is the permission slip from JNU.On JNU rowThe slip clearly says that Umar Khalid, one student, wanted to book the venue from 5 pm to 7.30 pm for the night. The form asks what is the purpose of booking the venue. He says poetry reading. The form asks whether any special arrangement is required. He says electricity for mike. Very well, the university gives him the permission. What transpired later has been question marked by many people. They said - Arrey yeh jhoota hai, woh jhoota [He lied, they lied]. Tariq Anwar said: Let the university carry out its investigation, and then let the police come. This paper is the report of the security department of the university.This paper is the report of the security department of the university, dated February 11, 2016. In this, 35 security personnel and 3 female guards gave their statement with their signatures. They said that at 16.45 pm, the personnel reached the venue. 38 people have given their response. They are part of the security of the university, and not the police. They say - "The crowd started to swell. Umar and Anirban stood there. 'Afzal Guru, Maqbool Bhat zindabad', 'Kashmir ki azadi tak jung rahegi', 'Bharat ki barbaadi tak jung rahegi', 'jis Kashmir ko khoon se seencha, woh Kashmir humara hai', 'hum kya maange azadi, bandook se lenge azadi', 'go India, go back', 'Indian Army murdabad'. There were a few people present there with their faces hidden with cloth.This is not a video, not a police, not an Arnab Goswami, this is the report of the security personnel who do not have connection with the government.Madam, an office order is issued by JNU. The letter is addressed to the complete staff and faculty at the university. This committee, which again has nothing to do with the government, ... A Communist party leader had said here that Smriti Irani had tried her best to get her own vice chancellor, but someone else was deputed. The person who we tried for was a Padma winner, decorated by the Congress government, not ours. This is the right of the President to appoint a VC.This is the same VC, who we did not appoint, issued this. "Misrepresentation of a proposed cultural event, although the objective was to hold a political meeting. Forcefully holding the event when the permission to hold was withdrawn. Creating a law and order situation in the campus and the prima facie inquiry committee finds the following individuals to be involved. The individuals who have been named by the faculty of JNU - Syed Umar Khalid, Anirban Bhattacharya, Ashutosh Kumar, Rama Naga, Anant Prakash Narayan, Kanhaiya Kumar, Aishwarya Adhikary, Shweta Raj. Considering the seriousness of the offence, and in order to enable a fair inquiry into the incident, the inquiry committee has recommended that the above mentioned students be academically suspended from JNU with immediate effect, during the pendency of the inquiry. However, they are allowed to stay in their respective hostels during the period of inquiry."This is not an order issued by the Home Ministry. The university faculty had issued this judgment based on facts.To accuse is known to be a sign of a successful democracy. I am presenting this evidence to counter people who have accused us. This has been attested by registrar of the university. The registrar was not appointed by us, but by the previous government. This pamphlet is dated February 22, 2013. Malikarjun Khadge was passionately saying today - "Hang everybody, including professors, if they speak against the nation." If he was here today, I would have shown him this.Two professors came out with a Kashmir solidarity rally during his government. "To show solidarity for the struggle freedom in Kashmir, and refuse to be a part of the collective conscience of this country."Another evidence we have from the university. "Abolish death penalty. Burn effigy of home ministry, not minister. Speak up against the judicial murder and hanging of Yakub Memon."Who was there in Mumbai on March 12? It's my mother's birthday, hence I remember that day till now. Bombs went off. Indians died. The terrorists did not ask the religion or caste of the people who died.This poster says: "Supreme Court judge, Hindu Fascist State of India, the state was scared of Yakub Memon. Our media is a communal corporate media. We are a murderous republic and our cannibal collective conscience was satiated by hanging Yakub Memon's. We must rise against this judicial muder."A call to rise against Supreme Court, which they approach for bail now. That is the strength of my democracy. A call to rise against the president of India, to whom you go and implore and say - "Nyay kijiye [please deliver justice]." The people who call him a hangman go knocking on his doors and he opens his doors and welcomes them. That is the strength of my democracy.Another MP here said that I am from Communist Party and Kanhaiya is my party member. Brother, I agree.Madam, this is a poster, which has the name of a child, unfortunately. I look at this child who has been mobilised as a weapon against the State. This is a child who does not have an idea that India is one, but a child who must have been infected with this thought. By those who want to bear arms to overthrow the state. It bears the name of Kanhaiya Kumar, Shaila Rasheed, Rama Naga - they are all members of the student union. Apart from saying - "Condemning the hanging of Afzal Guru", they claim it as a "nervous attempt by the Congress government." And this, Madam Speaker, is a notice given out on February 10, 2016. On the 9th night this transpires in the campus, and on the 10th this pamphlet is stuck all across with signatures.It says - "The public meeting was also disrupted for Mahishasur Martyrdom Day."What is Mahishasur Martyrdom Day, madam speaker? Our government has been accused. I miss today Sugata Bose and Saugata Roy in the House - champions of free speech, because I want to know if they will discuss this particular topic which I am about to enunciate in the House, on the streets of Kolkata. I dare them this.Posted on October 4, 2014. A statement by the SC, ST and minority students of JNU. And what do they condemn? May my God forgive me for reading this."Durga Puja is the most controversial racial festival, where a fair-skinned beautiful goddess Durga is depicted brutally killing a dark-skinned native called Mahishasur. Mahishasur, a brave self-respecting leader, tricked into marriage by Aryans. They hired a sex worker called Durga, who enticed Mahishasur into marriage and killed him after nine nights of honeymooning during sleep."Freedom of speech, ladies and gentleman. Who wants to have this discussion on the streets of Kolkata? I want to know. Will Rahul Gandhi will stand for this freedom. I want to know. For these are the students. What is this depraved mentality? I have no answers for it. [Irani throws away the pamphlet]Then, I thought, when many leaders say - "They are kids. They are saying it. Pardon them." It is possible. But how does this depravity gets seeded into the minds of our children?Unfortunately, the rows of the Congress party here are empty, madam speaker. I have said it time and again, 'shiksha ko ranbhoomi mat banao' (Don't make education a battleground). No one listened to this request of mine in both Houses. Today I am compelled to say this, madam speaker, are these just slogans?I seek to quote a Roman philosopher, who said - "A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gates freely. His lie whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of the government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor, he speaks in the accent familiar to his victims. He wears their face and arguments that appeals to the baseless that lies deep in the hearts of men. He rots the soul of the nation. He works secretly as an unknown. In a night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear."If I had quoted Chanakya here today then people said it was saffronisation.This is the reason I seek to quote a Roman philosopher.I wondered, where do our kids learn from? I am presenting an example in this House today, which just came to my desk. This is a history book for students of class 4 - Teacher's Reader. What are our teachers taught? The author of this book is Teesta Setalvad. This book has been commissioned by UPA's Kapil Sibal. The same UPA whose chairperson is Soniaji. Let's see what is to be taught to student of class 4."In our text and syllabus, we continue to perpetuate the colonial legacy of portraying ancient India, as synonymous with Hindu and Medieval India past with the Muslim." I quote from this book, Madam Speaker. Arvind Sawantji is from Maharashtra. This book was given to Don Bosco, Matunga. The school of my colleague Piyush Goyal."When we teach Shivaji, Akbar, Aurangzeb as responsible educators and animators, we need to ask which Shivaji do we need to take into the classroom."It is not only against Shivaji that is taught. Congress politicians allowed the killings for three days during the Sikh riots. That is also taught."Hindu-Christian riots in Kanya Kumari. How the propaganda of Hindu organisations target Christian minorities."You are teaching this to a child in the 4th standard. This is their idea of secular education. History taught to standard 6th. I quote, madam speaker."Kashmir is a much demonised land today...{pause} that the State militates against. The atrocities of the Indian State."Are we shocked that our students go to universities and say "Kashmir ki azadi tak jung ladenge.."?Scenario 4 on Page 5 - order issued to Delhi schools after the death of Indira Gandhi."Check what an English teacher is teaching." One of the words given to the children to draft a sentence was the word arrive. Of the several children who raised their hands, the one that the teacher chose to read out is - 'When a Sikh arrived in Delhi, he was killed by a Hindu.'Scenario 2 - The title is fascinating - 'Breeding Prejudiced Minds'. This commissioned by the UPA, led by the Congress party, given to children in the 6th standard. They are taught.Scenario 3 - Teaching of history in school boards all over Maharashtra. Has a single prescribed textbook on Shivaji. Teachers from the school in Bombay have expressed great difficulty in controlling emotions. One of them has said - "The schools that have active enrolment of Muslim students are rushed through the chapter on Afzal Khan and Shivaji's confrontation. It is a politically and socially loaded connotation. I can't meet eye to eye with Muslim students, so I start my chapter with an apology. There are many Afzals in my class." Says this teacher teaching in class 6th.I begged and I pleaded, don't make it about us and them. Our children are not vote banks. But nobody heard me.NCERT had warned not to distribute these books. No one heeded to their warning. Wasn't the NCERT of our government? The committee that studied these books and incidents, I am compelled to say that one of the committee members is a Muslim Vice Chancellor appointed to his post by the Congress government.An income tax officer, who served under the Congress government, now a Supreme Court lawyer. I did it because I will not be accused of politicising something, which should be a matter of concern for every Indian citizen and Parliamentarian. What do those committee members said after they read these books."This committee fails to understand that to what and whose purpose is this trust serving?" By quoting from authors from Pakistan writing pertaining to education of Indian students to an impressionable mind of a standard 6 student. This committee was enraged when the name suggested intention and action - Allah zarmeen Pakistan, Hindutva hell in Hindustan.Madam speaker, I have not shied away from answering any question in this Parliament.My plea is this. Across universities, when vice-chancellors said that we want to raise our flags proudly. They were condemned. Mr Gandhi went to Uttar Pradesh and said -"All these VCs belong to the RSS." I am sure he doesn't know that even today that among the chancellors of central universities, there are 20 VCs who were appointed by the Congress. 16 VCs were again appointed by the Congress. I challenge any of these Congress-appointed VCs to come and say with evidence that I have saffronised them, I will quit politics.In this same House perhaps. Sonia ji is not here, so can't tell her. Atal Bihari Vajpayee had said - "India is not a piece of land. It is a nation that is alive Rashtrapurush."He had said - "Yeh vandan ki dharti hai, abhinandan ki dharti hai / Yeh arpan ki bhoomi hai, darpan ki bhoomi hai / Ki nadi nadi humaare liye Ganga hai, iska kankar kankar humaare liye Shankar hai / Hum jiyenge to iss Bharat ke liye, marenge to iss Bharat ke liye / Aur marne ke baad bhi, Gangajal mein behti huee humaare asthiyon ko koi sunega, to ek hi awaz aayegi - Bharat Mata Ki Jai."The question that rises is that the same Atal Bihari Vajpayee who had said this had supported Indira Gandhi. Considered her a reflection of Durga. When for the pride of the nation, Indiraji had said - "Go and protect humanity."Today it seems that politics makes strange bedfellows. Sugata Bose delivered a speech, that was academically very good. I applaud to such speeches. Soniaji and Rahulji were compelled. We all should compliment each other. Shook his hands. I only wished that Dr Bose was to gift them a book called The Dead Reckoning by Sharmila Bose, Dr Bose's sister. A renowned historian. In the book, she writes that the Bangladesh liberation war was a fallacy. That the Pakistani army did nothing to Bangladeshis that Indira Gandhi went to support. The question that rises now - [Satta to Indira Gandhi ne bhi khoyi thi lekin unke bete ne Bharat ki barbadi ke naaro ka samarthan nahi kiya tha]. Even Indira Gandhi lost power, was out of power, but his son never supported slogans of India's destruction.The death of students is unfortunate. UGC had formulated regulations in 2012, in which it was required to have an anti-discrimination officer in all campuses. We had called a meeting of VCs. They accepted that there will be such an office in all campuses.We set up the Judicial Commission. Those students weren't delivered justice, the ones who lost their lives when the Congress in power. We did not indulge in biased politics. We said - The law should prevail, and hang those who are found guilty. It was attempt. I try to attempt every day.This is my request to all. If we make a battlefield out of campuses, vote banks out of kids, what will a few astray students from JNU raise slogans about. This nation will be led to the brink of anarchy by a politics that makes an opportunity out a dead student. Let the law take its course please. Let the police do its work. I declare that if Rahul Gandhi had asked me to go to JNU together and tell the students that the tricolour you are ashamed to hoist, and the nation that you wish to be destroyed, it is this same university from where students have gone and lost their lives on the border so that you can chant anti-national slogans in this campus. Rahulji did not do such a thing.My request to you all is that wherever you face a challenge - you said SC/ST kids should be in faculty - this is the same request I made of all vice-chancellors. I have myself requested them to listen to all children, especially who to them with emotional legacies and social challenges. It is incumbent upon us to provide them refuge and a productive life. My request is, help me build this nation, and not destroy it from within.Thank you madam speaker.</comment>

<comment>One correction there were no Sikh riots, it was Sikh genocide, no hindu was killed. Smriti is trying to be politically correct by calling it riots.Sikhs didn't get justice either from Kongress or BJP. Sikh history is never taught in India, the sacrifices of Gurus, Gurus Children buried alive in a wall because they refused to convert is never ever taught, neither by BJP or Kongress, so that muslim vote bank is not offended.</comment>

<comment>Its an absolutely brilliant speech . Hats off to that woman. Khujli jhaants and gandi s ran away scurrying for cover. She should become a teacher for pappu maybe he can become atleast 1% what she is. Its high time people of this country get over caste religion political bias and save this country from the sick commies congress mentalities</comment>

<comment>Your standard of a brilliant speech is very low, emotional drama doesn't make for lack of substance. Btw Smiriti said that no doctor was allowed. A doctor who attended Rohith, refuted her claim in hindustan times.</comment>

<comment>Isn't it that these funny fourth estate morons, most of them show rahulled wisdom and kejriwalled connivance in every share of pie.  So keep enjoying their Laluisms.</comment>

<comment>Oh here we have chanakya speaking</comment>

<comment>Call CBI and they'll turn it into another Aarushi case, kyun ?</comment>

<comment>And this is the police force that AAP wants under it ?!Eek, they sound like those paki fellows on arnab g's show : witless and wilfully malicious.What a spectacle dilli has become !S. Irani's ghost may now place her head after she's cut it off, at the feet of the lassi, if she doesn't prove the arrested students are JeD, JeM, ISI, D'aesh, LeT financed ....What fun.</comment>

<comment>The rest of us also have poorEnglish.Question is was a function held to  honour Afzal Guru, and were anti national slogans shouted.?Were these gentlemen who were arrested there.?Now Law will  take ts course</comment>

<comment>Can you be specific what SLOGANS?, Pakistan Zindabad was ruled out</comment>

<comment>Ruled out by whom?</comment>

<comment>Ruled out by your zee news producer</comment>

<comment>Any reason, Khalid and co are not cooperating, but trying to mislead and confuse the police?Who trained the comrades in interrogation techniques?</comment>

<comment>Not cooperating in police language means denying the accusations</comment>

<comment>Yes..you are right, they will beat him up mercilessly, to escape beating they will say anything.</comment>

<comment>Let the law take its course.The judiciary was appointed by Congis.</comment>

<comment>Haan chaddi...ab agar students jeet jaye to kehna cong appointed judiciary</comment>

<comment>Do not get panic....have faith in constitution and in our judiciary....truth must prevail....</comment>

<comment>Yeh report hai ya chewtiyapa?</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately for us, the nationalistic thugs like in the comment section here and in real life, like the lawyers, don't care about logical arguments. They don't believe in due process, free speech, or rule of law. They talk, and think like the Hulk in The Avengers. All they say is basically "Hulk Smash!!!"</comment>

<comment>Do not try to get away by intellectual superiority argument.  Frankly class of people who defended JNU anti-national under the argument of constitutional nationalist got caught with their pants down.  And that is the reality so don't try to spin the story.</comment>

<comment>Blind bhakts! Blind bhakts ! Blind bhakts ! Blind bhakts!!!! Those words suit you..... Your minds have been doctored at Nagpur so what difference will it make even after the revelations. Stupid people do not catch the real thief an caught a passerby and say "here is the thief!!!" Witchhunting at its crudest form.</comment>

<comment>If you don't want to appear as intellectually dumb, then please respond to the article point by point. Let's see.</comment>

<comment>They have nothing to say. Like the doctored video, their brains have been doctored permanently now!</comment>

<comment>Why divide India for whatever reasons you have? Oppose Govt as much as you like, support Congress, AAP or any dumb party you like..but why divide India?</comment>

<comment>Who is dividing India? The ones who doctored the videos with an intent to cause disrepute to a few student leaders? Why this mob mentality? You do not realize that they have done enough to break this country in this short span of time what the Congress could not do in more than 60 years!</comment>

<comment>Really? The biggest division in this country is given by Congress itself. And the way dirty politics are being played, if at all videos are "doctored" who knows who was behind the scenes. Grapes are sour only when you can't have them. India has to remain united and has to prosper. I am not in favor of compromising one for another</comment>

<comment>Yeah right. The congress and the Muslims divided India and you claim something else. You want to spread hatred go somewhere else.</comment>

<comment>You have virtually divided us into  a thousand pieces .</comment>

<comment>Only thousand pieces? I thought that there are more than 1000 pakis antinationals terrorists.</comment>

<comment>I'd go to Bhutan. Just make sure that it is you who do not have to go to Gambia!</comment>

<comment>Don't worry about me. You go to Bhutan first. They will not let you in.</comment>

<comment>Pakistan?</comment>

<comment>Hell</comment>

<comment>Lol lol ol ! Now I know what the paranoia is all about! The two virus - fake patriotism and political correctness is the flavour of the day. But please do not exhaust all your options here itself. After this patriotic cola has been sold, what will you sell? Hitdutva was sold. It was not sufficient.However patriotism is like salt that everyone needs. So you are latching on to this to create a paranoia around you? This is what happens when you put a soap opera specialist into the reigns of governing a huge and diverse country like ours. You think that you want to use the anacin for all kind of diseases? Gimmicks won't last my friend. Maturity will only ensure your longevity.</comment>

<comment>Sounds good man. Now the Doctor of anacin has spoken and you keep giving the anacin for all the virus you are spreading. After this cola you drink what else you will drink so that you can live in your fantasy world? Huge and diverse country like ours was in the hands of a foreign born Christian spy for 10 years. This person is far better than a family which looted us. So you don't like it go and vote for Congress again next time so that we can be looted again. That is your choice.</comment>

<comment>Have you started to drink the Patanjali brut wine? or the Gaumatra matured ale? And I suppose you have this much intelligence to know that the BJP or Congress are not the last word in Indian politics. Parties come and go. We do not have to be tied to one. The so called nationalists thumping the chests right now were the same ones who were in the Congress before and reinvented themselves at the right time. So no need to fool the pubic.</comment>

<comment>And you are the only super intelligence person left who knows parties come and go and blah blah. So called people like you have a gripe about everything since you are so in secure. </comment>

<comment>You can have any opinion about me. That I shall not dispute after all we are not going to be future relatives! What is needed is a logical stand on issues that are dear to our heart.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. Amen to it.</comment>

<comment>Don't get mad at me. I can't understand why we need to be over reacting to anything that happens here. Have we ever heard a riot, stampede or a dharna, say in a Denmark or a Japan? Why are we so emotional about everything? Had this thing occurred there, no one would even know about it. The law will take its own course and then the rest ca go about their work. The state need not be so jerky all the time. maybe the failure to get the correct intelligence in recent times like the Punjab affair made them nervous and made them do something to go on stirring up the only issue where majority of the people would not question. appear. I don't know why educated guys like you are not more rational in your thought processes. Why do we have to join a mob? What would a slogan do to us tangibly?</comment>

<comment>Have you heard about a non Muslim Japanese cannot buy land in Japan but a Muslim Japanese can. Have you heard about a non Muslim white Dutch not able to buy land in Netherlands some place but a Muslim Dutch can? No right? So in India a Hindu Buddhist Christian Sikh non-Muslim cannot buy land in J&K but a Muslim from there can buy anywhere. Have you heard a Japanese Muslim can have more than one spouse but a Japanese Buddhist Japanese Hindu Japanese Christian and Japanese Muslim woman can have only one spouse? Well in India a Muslim man does have to follow the same law what everyone else follows. If you have more than one spouse and if you are a non Muslim man or woman or a Muslim woman you are breaking a criminal law. Did Japan or Netherlands got divided and Muslims got what they wanted and yet they stayed here and multiplied like anything. In return the Hindus Buddhists Sikhs who fought with Muslims not only lost land to Muslims but now have to carry their burden. Why? So stop comparing us to Japan or Netherlands or brush up on your world knowledge before you want to debate.How did I join a mob? How did the state become jerky? Did BJP invent dharna? Trying to second guess everything people like you only shows that you don't believe in this democracy or the people who voted for the party in power. You just blaming BJP and showing your contempt is one thing but putting allegations with no proof and trying to spread lies and hatred is another thing. People like you question hoisting of a national flag and comparing it with fake nationalism is like saying you have nothing else to do. Else the how can the tax payers funded students where People like me are paying 3 lacs per student at JNU so that they can go there and become model citizens of India instead spends more than 10 years spending 30 rupees only per month so that they can raise anti Indian slogans and you are telling me we should lie low not worry about it and just move so that people like Abdul Hamid or Hanumanthapa can continue to give their lives for these anti nationals terrorists? No way. Universities are not anti India shitting grounds at least not the ones where people like me are paying. If they want to divide India they can do that in their own private house.</comment>

<comment>So it all boils down to the Muslims? The issue here is about evolved set of principles in dealing with the contentious issues.  When we face a tragedy, our brains do not act as the way we should. Have we tried to find a solution to any problem till now? The matter is not about Congress or BJP, Hindu or Muslim. The Dutch suffered the sea water  incursions in their low lands and they treated that problem not now but way back in the Middle ages. The Japanese solved many problems related to space, sanitation and the natural calamities with logical solutions. We have a list of several problems that have inflicted us since generations. And yet we make no attempt to understand that. What I meant to say is that this present government is always at the defensive and tries to act like the Bush doctrine - either you are with us or against us! In the real world there need not be one truth alone. There can be several truths too. You need to tackle them with soft and hard means. Islamic reformations are needed no doubt. But an illiterate mind will not appreciate logical analysis as easily as an educated one. Mohammad Ali or Chaka Khan are also Muslims. But have they not integrate with the advanced set of thoughts? Similarly, we also have many of our blind believing Hindus, Sikhs and Christians. Education (in the real sense) helps. Nationalism of the kind of Prussia or the Third Reich does push a nation into several wars. The European countries are wary of a war now and so they have formed a Union to check the chauvinistic tendencies of individual nations.  I am sorry there is no scope to discuss this over here. My explanation will run into hundreds of pages. Had you been near to me I would have offered you a drink and we could have discussed the matter the whole weekend. :) It is simply far too complicated to state in a few lines.</comment>

<comment>Did I say that? I just put the facts. If it boils down to something you can interpret the way you want. Also I disagree that this government is always on defensive and act as per Bush doctrine. You need proof and I don't see anything that suggest what you said. This government has brought kudos to India and in spite of we loosing out on defense railways roads etc during MMS it has brought back glory. I have never seen a noncorrupt hardworking government like this where the PM works 16 hours a day. If you don't like him that is ok but at least respect it as an Indian. Anyway thanks for the offer of drink. I am not worried about this government crossing its lines. India is a thriving democracy and it threw away a family hijacked party. This government is working but can always control some fringe elements as well as market how good they are working. Love to see non corrupt Suresh Prabhu or Manoharji or Gadkari bringing back road and ports focusing on infrastructure or even Irani correcting the fallacies of our education system where we are taught Nehru's jacket were dry cleaned in Paris. Wow hungry India just got independence and this is what we are taught in schools or what terrorist Teesta created text books are feeding us venom.</comment>

<comment>Yo Hindu Slaves...... Do you see the Taj Mahal? At least in beautiful pictures? How about the Red Fort where your nation looting and corrupt leaders give speeches?  Remember each time that your slave forefathers carried bricks day in and day out with Mughul lashes... they did not eat Mughlai Chicken Biryani or Shahi Beef Kabob... That is luxury food..... Remember that each time you eat Mughlai food in expensive Indian restaurants. You like fair skin and long legs of Katrina Kaif, Alisha Bi (Hema Malini), Tabu, Saira Banu and Shabana Azmi? ..... my soldiers gave Mughul genes to your short and dark Dravidian women. Thank Allah for not having to see actors like Rajnikanth every day.... Once a slave... always a slave..... You all have Mughul blood... Auarangabad, Gaziabad, Islampur, Shayari, Music, Dance, Architecture....It is everywhere.... You cannot erase your coward history of 1,000 years......Now get back to work... No slacking... Babri Masjid must be completed on schedule.</comment>

<comment>No we have the Govt influencing the Justice system to do that</comment>

<comment>Can you elaborate? What govt. did so far to influence the decision? Yes lobby is activated including rogue media and KHAP panchayat of JNU to influence the judiciary ...they did it many time earlier especially press.</comment>

<comment>may be they are not..may be they are just pure anti nationalsbut they are Indians and a iron hand is always not a solutionlook at afzal guru...made a martyr...I would have made him rot in jail for his life</comment>

<comment>Afzal guru went through the judiciary process and an ex congressman our President saw enough proof that he was a terrorist. And you are smarter than all of them. Wow</comment>

<comment>Ur stupid bjp made him a martyr u moron by turning a non issue into an internation one</comment>

<comment>BJP is full of hate towards anybody who is not hindu, they hate secularism, they want to copy Saudi Arabia.</comment>

<comment>Yep BJP divided this country, BJP made Afzal GUru attack Parliament and kill people, BJP made the court to give him death penalty, BJP made the ex congressman Pranab Da to waive his mercy petition, BJP made terrorists like Umar to raise antiIndia slogans while BJP gave 3 lac rupees per student so that they can go to JNU and BJP should have kept quiet while these terrorists are spreading terror and people like you who are their supporters are world experts. Yep got it man. Keep smoking what ever you are</comment>

<comment>I think Khalid is screwed..Kanhaiya may be charged with lesser crimes and let off with a lesser punishment, only and only if he cooperates and gives out dirt on JNU professors..So, I am very sure more than a few of JNU professors are completely screwed. I heard first hand that some of these JNU professors have relations with girl students even by coercion. The stink of JNU is too much..One good thing is JNU is finally breached. I</comment>

<comment>That's sickular logic..Latest sickular logic is that the offenders parents are poor and from low income family so the offender CAN NOT be an offender!!The sickular logic is reaching ridiculous low each passing day.</comment>

<comment>Naa...first 2 sentences and it enough for me...The usual BullShit from a pressstitute who had zero facts but an argument of "mere bai ne bola ki padosan ki bai ne bola ki padaosan ki bai ne bola..."It sounded more like a rant of a middle aged aunty than an article from a "journalist"</comment>

<comment>I tried to read, but could not go after half.. This is totally written with pre-occupied mind...!!</comment>

<comment>My lordKindly give final verdict, so that kanhiya might be released.Thanks for hearing this case on fast track, you r the saviour of justice in india. And kindly spare those ill-literate policemen, they studied in hindi medium school, that's why their english is so poor, order the govt to make them study english at least two hours a day on govt expenses.Jokes apart - RIP judicial system ( as these media persons doesn't need them)</comment>

<comment>i think kanhiya  will be released. but what about umar khalid ??</comment>

<comment>Nope...Kanhayya is a gone case..AAPHole morons and sickulars are thinking they KNOW what police strategy is..Wait and see, Kanhayya will become another hardick, Dhobi ka kutha, na ghar ka, naa Ghat kaa..Best thing is...JNU bastion is breached and all the left leaning orgs and professors are shiitting their pants...well done BJP...</comment>

<comment>What wrong did Umar Khalid do??? Please provide proof</comment>

<comment>for god's sake srinivas !! aren't u watching the news??</comment>

<comment>I am. Thats why I am questioning.One side of the story The video didn’t have any ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans at all, yet we played it repeatedly to spread madness and mayhem.  - Vishwa Deepak of Zee News stated in his resignation letter “As the main video, brought by reporter, did not have Pakistan Zindabad slogans, they aired another video in which anti-India sloganeering could be heard but no one could be clearly seen without confirming its authenticity or location. I do not know from where they brought this second video,”  Vishwa Deepak of Zee News stated in his resignation letterThe other side.Bassi has not shown any proof at all despite claiming he has plenty to show</comment>

<comment>Punjab gone for pAAPi's...https: //www. youtube .com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=tyb-JrmJlyA</comment>

<comment>Abe aur kuch ho na ho you are definitely lookin like a gone case. Ja jaake condoms count kar logon ke dustbins mein</comment>

<comment>More Bhakwaas</comment>

<comment>This is ridiculous, u show some news, i show some news is not what proves what happening there..in a personal interview he has clearly mentioned he supported the seditions..now what else do u need, if u say even that is wrong, then let the trial result come out and will satisfy on that</comment>

<comment>Lets assume again I am wrong and my source is wrong. But do you trust Supreme Court???In Kedar Nath Singh’s Case, 5 judges of the Supreme Court – a Constitution bench – made it clear that allegedly seditious speech and expression may be punished only if the speech is an ‘incitement’ to ‘violence’, or ‘public disorder’.So why were the cops in a tearing hurry to press sedition charges and arrest these students???</comment>

<comment>here ur pressing again the wrong button...pls see the impact of students doing this..do u understand what impact it can have when u ignite student minds like this... and who says the story is over..see what happens next...and our country where we have highest percentage of youth than any other who can build the nation..and if students perform these kind of acts..it will incite to violence and public disorder which is already happening.. the other case which u were telling also should be investigated and if the trial is done without punishing the offender, good citizens or nationalists should not stop in opening the case again...that is a really long time ago and manythings have really changed with time...</comment>

<comment>Actually everything that happen afterwards is cause of bjp. They turned it into an international event. Those students didnt say anything and even if they did after doing it they wud ve gone back to hostels smoked some gaanja and gone to sleep and next day it wud be something else but ur bjpigs had to make afzar a martyr so they shud be charged for sedition</comment>

<comment>chulle bhar paani mein doob ke marja tu</comment>

<comment>People should become Critical Thinkers and avoid jumping to Conclusions and Be more Responsible</comment>

<comment>Critical Thinkers ... Thinking: Cannot allow universities to be the breeding ground for terrorist ... polluting the mind of youth is the first step AND training in the explosives is the last. Cannot allow this in the name of free speech..</comment>

<comment>Are you being a Critical Thinker???1. Where is the proof that Universities are becoming breeding grounds for Terrorist activities???2. How many Terror attacks carried on Indian soil has had students from JNU???3. Provide an iota of proof (not doctored videos and biased views) that these students who have been arrested were indulging in anti-social activities</comment>

<comment>It goes like this.First, Afzal Guru is made a hero, his death is proclaimed to be a murder. Both of which is utterly despicable lies. He was a terrorist.Somebody, somewhere uses the meeting at JNU, its video to convince and motivate the youths of Kashmir or elsewhere to fight Indian police and soldiers.Even without  JNU propaganda, there are so many misguided youths fighting in the name of Islam. Do you want more of them?Today it is Afzal, tomorrow it will be Osama Bin Laden, is it okay to do so? Think again. </comment>

<comment>You are making claims again without proof. Let us assume for a moment your claims are True.Even if it is True that Afzal Guru was being made a Hero (actually he was not), this does not fall under the category of SeditionIn Kedar Nath Singh’s Case, 5 judges of the Supreme Court – a Constitution bench – made it clear that allegedly seditious speech and expression may be punished only if the speech is an ‘incitement’ to ‘violence’, or ‘public disorder’.So why were the cops in a tearing hurry to press sedition charges and arrest these students???</comment>

<comment>Is it not true that Afzal's hanging was proclaimed as Judicial Murder? How can a Supreme Court judge do it? Indian courts are slow, but not kangaroo court.Ghar ghar mein Afzal paida hoga ? What is that --- is it not making a terrorist a hero?</comment>

<comment>In a democracy you are entitled to criticize the Government, Police, Judiciary and even the Army. There is no Illegality in it. It may provoke a few emotional people but nothing wrong legallyDid we not criticize the courts when Salman Hit and Run verdict was out???Did we not criticize the courts when Jayalalitha acquittal happened???Now coming to Ghar Ghar mein Afzal Paida honge. What is wrong with what they said???</comment>

<comment>That's not what happened there moron..Kanhayya insulted Hindus and Hinduism..."bramhanical Tyranny"..WTF is that?? I am a low caste and even I am offended by this statement!!Moron Khujili has been attacking govt and Modi for past 1 year as if that is his only work..So, your argument that the students were targeted for anti-govt slogans holds no water..We all aw the videos...NO, not the ones in NdTv...but the real ones...</comment>

<comment>I think he was right in insulting bramanhical Tyranny, that is the truth and that has ruined India and brought on slavery for generations.Guru Nanak, Kabir, Ravi das all spoke against brahmical Tyranny. I don't think you are low castes you are just a liar pretending to be lower caste.</comment>

<comment>Stop being emotional. Where is Sedition in all that you claim they have said.Bramhanical Tyranny is a phrase used very often by several Political parties (Hindus). Why were they not arrested???</comment>

<comment>Ideology is as dangerous as weapons ...Strongly suggest this article: Please google:‘Jihadi John,’ a graduate of my radical universityBy Avinash TharoorThis happened in University of Westminster UK. The reason why UK muslims are more radicalized ...</comment>

<comment>Lets stick to JNU issue. I will read the article you have mentioned for sure but later.Emotions are even more dangerous</comment>

<comment>Had I not read this article, I would not be blaming JNU students to this extent ... this article is so important, and one hundred percent True.You will not understand JNU, until you read this article.</comment>

<comment>This clearly shows you are Gullible. One article changed your Views??? Dangerous. This is how young children in Pakistani Madrasas are brianwashed</comment>

<comment>I keep an open mind and get new ideas, if it is worth it. Maybe I am gullible, but I am open to positive things. Afzal for you is probably a Hero, for me he is just a piece of garbage who killed innocent Indian citizens</comment>

<comment>For me Afzal is a Traitor. But for BJP's best friends he is notPDP: Afzal’s hanging a travesty of justice http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pdp-afzals-hanging-a-travesty-of-justice/article8234905.ece Thanking Pakistan not enough: PDP now wants Afzal Guru's body to be returned to state http://www.firstpost.com/politics/thanking-pakistan-not-enough-pdp-now-wants-afzal-gurus-body-to-be-returned-to-state-2131377.html MLAs of PDP party demand Afzal Guru’s remains; Omar terms move attempt to buy vote http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/mlas-of-pdp-party-demand-afzal-guru-s-remains-omar-terms-move-attempt-to-buy-vote/story-YRosPV5E9NP22WEK3MvBFP.html Signing memorandum for Afzal Guru’s mortal remains was political compulsion: Cong, PDP MLAsA year after they signed memorandum seeking return of mortal remains of Afzal Guru, the Congress and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) legislators call signing of the memorandum a political “compulsion”.http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/signing-memorandum-for-afzal-gurus-mortal-remains-was-political-compulsion-cong-pdp-mlas/#sthash.PeVl1RWS.dpuf But BJP did not arrest PDP for Sedition???</comment>

<comment>That is politics. No political party is God. But for ordinary people like us it is important that terrorists will not be eulogized in the India, no matter what. That is it. Because they bring pain and tear for us ...</comment>

<comment>Where did your Nationalism disappear??? What happened to your Patriotic anger against anti-nationals??? Politics dissolved your patriotism???</comment>

<comment>well said...Supporting terrorists seems like a fad..</comment>

<comment>Samir Ji...That moron you are debating is a AAPtard...What ever his Khujili supports will be what he will parrot here..Tomorrow if Khujili takes a U turn and starts saying these people are traitors, he will also take a U turn..For you and me, irrespective of BJP/RSS/ABVP stand, we know these "middle aged" students in JNU are traitors....</comment>

<comment>Thanks a lot!!!</comment>

<comment>so what to be done in this case as per you ?</comment>

<comment>too late.  damage has been done</comment>

<comment>yes for the country by the protestors..we will together not let it happen more..are u with us</comment>

<comment>How can protesters do any damage to the country??? If you do not know history of BJP let me enlighten you. BJP also grew as a party by protesting against the government of the day - Congress</comment>

<comment>i dont care how bjp comes or congress or AAP comes, what i know is there are some ppl protesting and shouting anti india slogans..is this truth as per u or not ??</comment>

<comment>Where is the proof???</comment>

<comment>u show me the proof to believe in your favour</comment>

<comment>I did not accuse anybody. It is you and your government which accused the students of Sedition</comment>

<comment>right. so show me proof that he is not guilty...just by saying u dont accuse doesnt prove ur statement</comment>

<comment>According to Indian Law, anybody and everybody is Innocent unless proven Guilty. So it is for the people who accuse somebody of a guilt to prove the charges made and not vice versa.Get to know the Indian law first and then go dancing around town screaming Nationalism</comment>

<comment>indian law ?? u ppl explained them nicely... That in our country we can do anything and say anything and can still defend...i am waiting for the judgement and not jumping to conclusions... ur the one who is dancing here,,,let the trial output something on this case....</comment>

<comment>that's what we are doing... ur the one who are dancing here.. I am waiting for the o.p of trial to come out...indian law is well explained by u ppl that u can always do anything say anything in this country and still can defend.. Irony..Lets wait for the judgement</comment>

<comment>Even after declared innocent, Khujili keeps bringing up 2002 and Ishrat..I wonder why...As per you, if a Hindu is declared innocent by courts, its not validBUTif a commie or muzzie is under scanner, he/she is innocent until proven guilty!!!Kaunsi mansiktha se jee rahe ho thum log?</comment>

<comment>Khalid already confessed,yet, this moron is asking for proof..when courts asked Khujili for proof against gadkari and jaitley, he was making excuses...</comment>

<comment>When and where did Khalid confess??? Give me Proof please and I will rest my case</comment>

<comment>Like I already started, go to some other sites than NDTv and FP...</comment>

<comment>ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha</comment>

<comment>well, your kind was dreaming they will get bail next day..Courts have deemed it otherwise after seeing the proof..YEAH...all are mental fellows..only YOUR kind is smart ;)between, these morons are in front of the same judges they shouted against..You think they will get out soon ;););)</comment>

<comment>It does not matter. Amit Shah stayed in Jail for a long time. His Bail was rejected several times. Does that make him criminal???</comment>

<comment>But he did not bittch like you guys. He trusted courts and got out..If a person as important as Amit Shah can sit in jail and go through the justice system, why these JNU anti-nationals can't??</comment>

<comment> Page 8: Explains how Kanhaiya Kumar was apprehended, basis the Zee News footage.   The video didn’t have any ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans at all, yet we played it repeatedly to spread madness and mayhem.  - Vishwa Deepak of Zee News stated in his resignation letter “As the main video, brought by reporter, did not have Pakistan Zindabad slogans, they aired another video in which anti-India sloganeering could be heard but no one could be clearly seen without confirming its authenticity or location. I do not know from where they brought this second video,”</comment>

<comment>then its simple ask Vishwa Deepak to testify in court save those students and have his revenge on zee</comment>

<comment>But this government and its machinery branded them anti-nationals, terrorists etc etc. Why did they not wait for the trial to be completed???</comment>

<comment>does our government decide or our court ?? I hope trail is still going ...... let the govt say what they want to why being bothered about that</comment>

<comment>The government has branded him as an anti-national. They have defamed him. He have harassed him. What if the same thing had happened to you or your family member (God forbid)???</comment>

<comment>Simply file a defamation against govt ....please don't make it look one sided as if those students are damn clean ....they must have done something that has lead to this situation</comment>

<comment>The damage has been done. Irrepairable damage</comment>

<comment>nonsense..When Khujili can write a sorry letter to gadkari after lying, govt can say sorry if you lot can prove Kanhayya's innocence,,,</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal got punished for his mistake. Kejriwal committing a mistake does not entitle BJP to do the same. Anyways are you claiming BJP is following the footsteps of Kejriwal???</comment>

<comment>It was in relation to 'irreparable damage' bakwas,,Every "potential' criminal will claim the same....The law and courts must be allowed to take course..Even Modi was hounded for 12 years, he did not bittch like you lot are doing now..</comment>

<comment>Lame excuse</comment>

<comment>AAPHoles + Logic = never happens..</comment>

<comment>God Bless you</comment>

<comment>He/she already has..But your Khujili is supporting people who are insulting Dura maa..What would you to a person who calls your mother a 'sex worker'?why is Khujili supporting people who are insulting Hindus and our gods?</comment>

<comment>hope a fair trial does it all now... if they really have those ideas against country, they will be out in the trial....however Mr.khalid condessed himself in the interview on national channels that he has done that or he is in favour of those kind of protests what else do u need ??</comment>

<comment>What did Umar Khalid confess?? Where did he confess?? Times Now - where Arnob Goswami jumps to conclusions without allowing the other person to speak???</comment>

<comment>no but when he said shouting slogans pro afzal guru is his freedom of speech because he thinks fair trial was not done for him !!</comment>

<comment>thats misinterpretation. he questioned afzal guru's hanging which is allowed under the law</comment>

<comment>enough of defending yarr.. u and me may misinterpret, u saying like everyone has misinterpreted and why more defending when he is clearly talking in simple english saying he is supporter of protests..whatever let the courts decision come ...</comment>

<comment>Let me even consider you are right. Prove it</comment>

<comment>boss common, i may mis interpret, u might, but does everyone misinterpret when he is clearly saying for himself supporting the protests, enough of defending man !!</comment>

<comment>I will change my views. Just prove it</comment>

<comment>let the judgement come in favour of u, i will also change my views</comment>

<comment>Sure. I am in no hurry.</comment>

<comment>Bassi is out of his mind! The poor bugger! He has made a laughing stock of himself. But then the top brass of the police are basically powerless buffoons. Stuck between the politicians and the lower ranks - they have nowhere to go - enjoy while you can!</comment>

<comment>Well, not quite, but we can point a terrorist from far, like kanhaiya Kumar, and party.... Terrorists, you heard that right</comment>

<comment>I am NOT certifying your patriotism, But you DON'T demean mine.</comment>

<comment>The courts will decide</comment>

<comment>That is very generous of you sir.  Will the courts get same opportunity in kanhaiya case too? </comment>

<comment>Very much. But unfortunately you and your gang have abused, insulted and defamed him</comment>

<comment>Why not let the courts pass judgment on that too? </comment>

<comment>That does not entitle you to Insult anybody</comment>

<comment>and you are an Andha Bhakth???</comment>

<comment>Rahul Gandhi hails from a family of scoundrels like Indra Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi who were supporting the Soviet Union and its Eastern European communist satellites, harboring cruel anti_american and anti-British sentiments. If at the center of a United States governmental institution, an agitating group shouts "long live the Soviet Union," the United States government would arrest the person for unlawful activities, and rightly so. In the Jawaharlal Nehru University, a governmental institution, Kanhiya Kumar and his gang shouted "Pakistan Zindabad," protesting the executions of the likes of Afzhal Guru and Yakub Memon after Supreme Court verdicts, Rahul Gandhi says it is not an act of sedition, and hinders freedom of speech and freedom of expression. This scoundrel's grand-mother and his father would not even tolerate any small criticism against them by the general public, and would promptly arrest the so-called offenders.</comment>

<comment>What kind of a fuckin senile idiot are you? Jobless oaf, I've seen you post for more than a whole year pointing fingers  paapu and Sonia looteri mata. You idiot, you buffoon, please be reminded that the BJP won the national elections 2 years back. Yes, you senile man, they did. Ask questions to the BJP, why aren't they arresting the crooks in the congress? Why do they still turn a blind eye and point fingers, just like you shamelessly do?Do you have the guts to do that?</comment>

<comment>India is country of law and order.  Cowboy attitude is unlawful and unexpected.Let the law take are of allegations like National Herald, JNU celebration of Afzal Guru, etcTo answer your question, India will not be banana republic that can lock up anybody without proven guilty.And lastly one free advice, don't try to legitimize your anguish by using hostile and uncivilized vocabulary. </comment>

<comment>This is a free country, dear bhakt. I'm not legitimizing anything, simply exercising my freedom of expression, my uncivilized vocabulary was directed at a troll, and there is nothing hostile in it.

<comment>The answer is NO. They dont have the evidence. They dont have the guts. These are all Campaigns to insult Nehru family</comment>

<comment>so much love for tharki chacha nehru!</comment>

<comment>He was the Prime Minister of India just like Modi is now</comment>

<comment>His legacy remains</comment>

<comment>Remain in History Not Today. Legacy what other follows and make it continue.. Who is Follow his legacy today.??</comment>

<comment>Its my choice</comment>

<comment>I guess he meant the fake Gandhi family - the fascist vich and her braindead son.Curse would be a right word instead of legacy.</comment>

<comment>Would you believe me if I told you that this senile oaf is based in the US, has been posting the same comments for more than a whole year? The dedication is just out of this world, I'm astounded that BJP have the power to brainwash stupid fools to such an extent. </comment>

<comment>Please don't strain what ever is left of your pathetic brain...</comment>

<comment>Says a keyboard jihadi based in a gutterYou could also been in the US if you used your time judiciously instead, you chose to waste it by trolling all day and blame Modi for your miserable life!</comment>

<comment>rukmi the gutter pig, found here just like vardarajan singing paeans for modiji. Jobless since years, but finds solace in worshiping a God who already happens to be PM. Lol.</comment>

<comment>Whats with AAPHoles and logic..Do you become brainless AsSsHoles after becoming an AAPHole ORbecause you are a brainless AsSsHole, you have become an AAPhole?aaah...the great mysteries of life I say..;)</comment>

<comment>Mirchi lagi?!I worship no one - neither Modi/RSS/BJP, nor the god of murderous desert cult who apparently gifts 72 booby babes and unlimited sex for slaughtering Kafirs.As far as the joblessness is concerned it's directly proportional to the number of trolls, ask yourself and you friend mr. fake Srinivas.Happy? Now go back to the drain where you live.</comment>

<comment>David Headley also went to United States</comment>

<comment>Have you not observed that these guys dont even have a conscience. They spread Lies, abuse people, praise the government even if it has faltered BIG time. And yet they call themselves protectors of Hindutva and Nationalism</comment>

<comment>Can you show me an iota of proof that Kanhiya Kumar and his gang shouted "Pakistan Zindabad,"??? I mean un-doctored proof</comment>

<comment>it cannot be shown to blind people like you</comment>

<comment>So you dont have proof</comment>

<comment>In Kedar Nath Singh’s Case, 5 judges of the Supreme Court – a Constitution bench – made it clear that allegedly seditious speech and expression may be punished only if the speech is an ‘incitement’ to ‘violence’, or ‘public disorder’.Where is the Sedition in this case Mr. Bassi???</comment>

<comment>We do have respected judges in Patiala HC who will do the judging. The whole intent and tone of this article is for the press to appoint themselves as advocate of Kanhaiya and others. Why don't you stick to reporting the facts instead of joining the fray and trying to influence the minds of your readers?Where is similar diligence in unearthing exactly the kinds of questions any forensic apparatus of law and order is required to do, in order to do their job comprehensively. If the police have overreached, surely HC will reject the sedition charge; if not, then he will be held accountable as needed. In either case, you have failed your job of not becoming the part of the story you are supposed to be reporting on without taking sides.</comment>

<comment>Madam, it is the Delhi High Court that will hear the case and judge.All the initial drama was at the Patiala House Court in Delhi. </comment>

<comment>madam ji.... ganda hai par dhanda hai ye... ab main ye nahin likhunga to meri daily ki daru ke paise kahan se aayenge... khana to jnu main sarkari kgarche par badiya chal raha hai...aapk sewakcommie free loader author</comment>

<comment>Hey before you get into forensics and all that technical stuff, teach your police friends to spell Kanhaiyas name right in the report. They even spelt it wrong. Let's start with the basics, yeah?</comment>

<comment>What will happen to these students??? Did they deserve the suffering and harassment and insinuation???</comment>

<comment>Bassi deserves a Bharat Ratna for this status report???</comment>

<comment> Page 10: "During the course of investigation, the investigating agency intends to unearth larger conspiracy." Then Kanhaiya should have been arrested after the conspiracy was unearthed???</comment>

<comment>Bassi has already coined new terms:1. Guilty until proven innocent2. pre-sedition arrest, where you are arrested for predicted seditionary activity</comment>

<comment>I wonder how such people become Police Commissioners???</comment>

<comment>It's quite clear it's even more than bribe</comment>

<comment>Appears so</comment>

<comment>So FP's couch journos their hero is innocent  just because of the incorrect English in the FIR!Is it English exam or what?</comment>

<comment>From this status report, I dont even think these students should be made to  "Stand Up on the Bench"  as punishment???</comment>

<comment>Is your name "Srinivas" or "Shahnawaz" or maybe "comrade "</comment>

<comment>he is perhaps a sissy jihadi scūm, no guts to clean ISIS toilet so doing keyboard jihad he posts about 500 daily trolls just on this comment sectionmust be sitting in a madrasa</comment>

<comment>I am not a liar like you. I am not a coward like you to hide my name</comment>

<comment>coward? really?if you were not a sissy you would have gone to Syria to clean ISIS toilets like your jihadi friends did instead of doing useless keyboard jihad with fake Hindu name. allah doesn't give 72 booby babe for unlimited sex just for keybaord jihad.</comment>
