<comment>Rahul Gandhi is an idiot.As much as he is on the right side of the argument, he is not the leader who can lead and make a change in our politics.</comment>

<comment>which are the paid media news channels?</comment>

<comment>Rahul - and OUT OF THE BOX thinking. Cmon, what is the writer writing. Which box is he referring to. The best box he has is the money box. Loads of corruption cash.</comment>

<comment>His nana Nehru divided India on religious lines and now he and his Italian mom want to divide India further on caste lines. This one family has inflicted so much loss, so much pains/agonies and bleeding wounds on the nation which even Pakistan couldn't do after waging 3 full-fledged wars.</comment>

<comment>We have to thank GGGGGREATTTTT Nehru, for plight of Kashmiri pundits, every death of Indians in Kashmir, every solders death in Kashmir.  What we expect from his great grandson is plain bullshit.  Hope that voters will learn a lesson and not vote for congress</comment>

<comment>This Buddu's great grandfather - first PM ( and his Congress party) is mainly responsible for the death of every Indian soldier in J&K since Independence.</comment>

<comment>Ask this Johnny come lately what was he doing when momma was ruling with the muppet Manmohan?</comment>

<comment>The only other word pappu has learnt after women empowerment is modi and rss. In two years two words! Wow! </comment>

<comment>Better than feku who says let the student come out in you and yet imprisons innocent students</comment>

<comment>Hating modi is ok and every one has different views. But hating India and slogans against India not accepted. If few were shouting against India why kannaiyya . Khalid and bhaytacharya did stop them. It was not forum or discussion table where they were expressing their views.  It was protest with big round of slogans</comment>

<comment>Morons can lie only chanting  anti national  slogans  are innocent  this idoilogy  show you  must be khujli  papau. </comment>

<comment>Ha ha, they were as innocent as hafeez saeed. Your hatred for modi seems to define the character of who gets arrested. Don't support ppl who shout down down India or ppl who encourage them...</comment>

<comment>Sonia Gandhi must take seriously that India is also her country though she migrated. She must know that because India is very rich cultured. she is accepted as the president of the congress party, India voted her to rule the country. She must not betray Indian. Before every parliament session she is bringing  some issues and derailing the session. Now the issue Sonia is using to derail one more parliament session is challenging the integrity of India. It is anti national and challenging SC verdict on Afzal. It may not matter to Sonia Gandhi,  but she cannot instigate militants and anti national openly to take revenge to people of India for becoming  a minuscule party.  Supporting anti nationals and challenging SC verdict is just criminal activity. Hope Indian judicial system will take action against the congress party and save India.</comment>

<comment>Sonia Gandhi has no business to be a leader in India.  You may address other aspects later.</comment>

<comment>anti hindu and pro afzal pappu gandhi will never get support from true patriotic indians. he can only bribe and buy votes from his looted black money to win elections.</comment>

<comment>Why he failed to bring legislation at the time of his govt regime more so when more students committed suicides..Now he lives chanting mantras RSS  RSS MODI MODI.In the absence of these two words he is a big zero.We are  eager to see his performance in thecurrent session of parliament.</comment>

<comment>What an utter fool.. The Indian penal code applies everywhere including universities</comment>

<comment>Just to be the front page news in the paid main stream media  Rahul Gandhi will go to any extent, even if it means supporting the students of JNU who raised anti national slogans , calling of destruction and break up of INDIA and supporting a terrorist like Afzal Guru who was responsible for the Parliament  terror attack. Was he sleeping (as usual!!!!!!) when the supreme court gave its verdict that Afzal Guru  be hanged? Why he did not tear up the SC verdict as it was his UPA which was in power? Why Rahul did not show sympathy to Afzal then when he was in power? Why he is sympathising with a terrorist now and showing disrespect to the Supreme court verdict and the constitution?  Why a contempt of court and disrespect of supreme court verdict be slapped on him? Rahul is ably assisted by his B-team AAP unemployed CM Of Delhi Kejriwal who has nothing better to do except to criticise the PM OF INDIA and NDA for all the problems faced by Delhi as also to support the Desh drohi communist background students of JNU who not only supported terrorists like Afzal but also shouted slogans on break of India and favoured the anti national elements of Kashmir. Does Rahul realise that he is foolishly supporting the break of India just because Congress lost the elections in 2014? Does he ever comprehend that the worst form of dictatorship was imposed by his grand mother Indira Gandhi and that fundamental rights were abolished and many students were killed, jailed and tortured. It is better Rahul reads the history of India from 1947 onwards. He should also realise that the Scamgress he heads as VP is a breakway congress created by Indira Gandhi and has nothing to do with the original congress of the Nehru - Sardar Patel era. It is high time that Rahul thinks of doing something good for India's development instead of siding with students who are hell bent on destruction of India. It is high time that Rahul pays respects to lakhs of brave armymen, airforce and navy personnel who sacrificed their lives to make INDIA A SAFERPLACE instead of showing disrespect by supporting the anti govt, anti national and anti INDIA destructive students of JNU.</comment>

<comment>Rahul is a totally lost cause and a curse. He ishould be called Rahu the malefic graha. No need to waste our time on these traitors, crooks and conspirators. They all need to be locked up in Tihar or wherevr.</comment>

<comment>How has Congress treated dissent in their party?? First make a law to protect dissenters of your party. YSR-dead, Pilot-dead, Scindia-dead, Jitendra Prasad-dead...list is long...'Emergency' bhool gaya 'Buddhu'!!</comment>

<comment>Excellnt comment!. Remind the people of these murderes.</comment>

<comment>MMS was not able to dissent ever.</comment>

<comment>That is why he is alive.</comment>

<comment>Maunimohan Singh and dissent. Are you kidding???. History will rate him as the most nikamma PM ever.</comment>

<comment>That honour will go to feku soon</comment>

<comment>It is now clear that all parliament sessions until 2019 will be washed out...May even after 2019 because this has now become a trend....</comment>

<comment>If Rahul Gandhi wants a law on dissent, he should first win the Parliamentary election for Congress. Which looks very much possible now !</comment>

<comment>he doesn't even qualify for the title of LOP</comment>

<comment>keep it for Modi !</comment>

<comment>if rahul opposed anti national slogans at jnu. he would had support of indians</comment>

<comment>Glad to know that RG wants to end discrimination in colleges and universities.  But, does he have the capacity to understand this simple concept - discrimination will truly end only on the day when quota system - an insidious form of discrimination - is forever laid to rest?</comment>

<comment>Rahul Gandhi himself is a product of discrimination.  If not for the Caucasian race of his family members, no would pay any attention to him.</comment>

<comment>TOO THICK to understand ANYTHING .....they want the SAME quota system and also overturn the SC guidelines in the states they rule ...they are insidiously bringing in reservation for muslims</comment>

<comment>Nation first POLITIRCS next PLEASE. We have huge problems in country. Poverty, unemployment, Health and R&D research. Keep talking about moving targets... Lame excuses to block the business.What are you doing to pass GST?</comment>

<comment>He is hoping that with generous help from media, this government may fall and he may be able to form a patch-work mahagathbandhan government ! In that case, some family slave will sit on the PM chair and Pappu can just roll up his sleeves and throw a bunch of papers at him, which will be passed as law !</comment>

<comment>Let us make ervery effort that instead of mahagathbandhan govt. he gets the bandhan-handcuffs- on his wrists and goes to jail along with mama and the rest of the criminals and desh drohis.</comment>

<comment>raga biggest mistake of india after partition</comment>

<comment>Pure poitics no inclination towards nation or its well ness</comment>

<comment>MP'S IN PARLIAMNET MUST FIRST RAISE THE  QUESTION ABOUT HIS SUPPORT TO JNU ANTI NATIONALS ---ASK FOR HIS RESIGNATION</comment>

<comment>YES INDEED.</comment>

<comment>I don't see parliament functioning normally until 2019...</comment>

<comment>The day congress looses majority in RS and the VP changes, BJP will have the RS Chairman (VP in this case) throw out the Congress MP's and get on with business. Remember what the same Ansari did during the hooliganism of SP and RJD MP's during womens reservation bill passage ? They were thrown out using RS marshals and now the same VP cries foul as madam Sonia is no more driving things on the Govt. side and still seems to be doing the bidding for congress. Its a mess and we Indians are on a royal ride to say the least</comment>

<comment>Actual he has no powers to do unlike Speaker of Loksabha.  I don't understand under which capacity he did that but now he asked for such a law because he also fed of congress</comment>

<comment>It has become a fashion these days to offer unnecessary advice to young and emerging leaders of this poor nation. Be it Rahul, Kejriwal, Tejaswi, Tej Pratap, Akhilesh, Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya, Jai Vardhan Singh, Karthik Chidambaram, or Kanimozhi...Jao bhai jao...These young leaders are eyes and hearts of the country...They know the best.</comment>
