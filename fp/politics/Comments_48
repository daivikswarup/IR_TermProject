<comment>The Vatican is extremely unhappy that its forced religious conversion programme has been halted and the Gujarat Hriday Samrat defeated all of its sinister designs and became Bharat Hriday Samrat. That is why there is so much of hatred against Modi and they tried to implicate him falsefully in 2002 riots, efforts to tarnish his image and defeat his govt are in full swing. Pre$$titutes are fed daily from the hands of Church. As per the Church, Muslims in India should never be allowed to support BJP. Church needs the Muslim support to defeat hindus and convert everyone to christianity.The Church is working against the will of Jesus by converting everyone. The Pope had said, we forcefully converted and planted the cross in europe and north america in first millenium, South america, australia and africa in the second millenium and now is the turn of Asia and especially India and China. That is why china has banned him and china says one more christian = one less chinese as they are brain washed by the pedophile, homosexual and r@pist fathers and archibishops and turn them into anti nationals</comment>

<comment>AAPtards have lost the trust and credibility of the people of Delhi completely. Now no one listens to them. Their drama over 'fight against corruption' is similar to a pr@stitute fighting for virginity. Nobody cares a hoot for them, so wherever there is a news item aaptards quickly login and show their frustration on that forum making unverifiable baseless accusations against non AAPtards ! Earlier Delhiites used to say with pride 'paanch saal kejriwal', now after Kejriwal showed his true colours and betrayed them, they are saying ' l@-ude ka ball kejribal' !.-</comment>

<comment>The author seems to be  a  paid congressi and doesnt want to say the obvious. AK will win the majority if elections are held now or in the future.  The authors fantasy of congress winning will not happen. Congress will be crushed and AK will win majority in all the three regions of the state.  Unlike last time when parties were restricted to their  own regions this time it will be AK  across all regions of the state.</comment>

<comment>if you are talking about J&K, Congress was the only party which won seats in all 3 regions last time.</comment>

<comment>IT will be AK this time. Remember Delhi Actually he took the entire congress votes which  he will repeat all over the  country including JK.  He actually demolished and decimated congress....</comment>

<comment>If not for the BJP presence in Jammu and Kashmir, the problem will never be solved and Pakistan and Arab states will play their own game for ever.  Mehbooba Mufti is not smart or else she would have assumed power within reasonable time.  He father realized this problem long ago. The Congress dynasty and the Abdullah family will never allow her to be re-elected if the legislative assembly is dissolved and fresh elections are called so quickly.</comment>

<comment>WISH BJP HAD SELECTED NITISH KUMAR INSTEAD OF MODI IN 2014--------This is not the India we wanted in 2014.......Indian people are so disappointed with Narendra Modi that 2019 has started looking like 1977 again. Indian men are angry and Indian women are disappointed at how this feku from Gujarat and his 40 chor and 5 choranis have done nothing to change how things were in India under Congress but made it worse. Black money was promised within 100 days but not a single paisa is brought back yet, nobody has gone to jail for corruption. Suresh Kalamadi is free, A. Raja is free, Kanimozi is free, Sharad Pawar is free,…. Nobody has gone to jail but on top of that Modi has delivered his own corruption, nepotism and incompetency through Arun Jaitlley’s DDCA corruption, Sushma Swaraj’s misuse of office, nepotism and breaking the law, Vasundhara Raje’s blatant misuse of power and helping a criminal Lalit Modi, the Vyapam scam and murders, Chattisgargh PDS scam, Smiriti Irani’s lying under oath about education, religious intolerance and killing of Muslims, increasing fanaticism and making a laughing stock of India with gayish behavior on world stage by hugging Western leaders all the time. Modi and his nincompoop goons could not protect India at Pathakot terrorist attacks on Indian soil… We only wish that BJP had selected a family loving man, a good husband and good father Nitish Kumar in 2014 instead of this Feku Modi.</comment>

<comment>Nitish is much weaker now than he was with BJP. For Biharis Jungle Raj ke achche din wapas aagaya hain !In seats, JDU goes from 117 to 71.Strength of partner, RJD this time has 80 as opposed to 91 for BJP.In coalition strength, 178 instead of 206.In coherence, BJP would stand-by him in every way possible. Now, JDU, RJD and Congress are old enemies working together.In governance, BJP has shown much, much better results everywhere. Laloo is a pathetic failure at governance, and will provide no administrative or technocratic input.Of course, weakness itself can be a source of strength for JDU/RJD/Congress, like for UPA-1. Still, expect a dark period of dramas starting a fortnight or two later. Like what happened with the AAP after the Delhi victory.The only reason this result is being hyped is that Nitish looks like a major anti-Modi messiah and a probable PM candidate for sickulars !--</comment>

<comment>leaders in Kashmir are living like a frog in a well, happy with the cool surroundings around. They do not see what is going on outside, they just look in the mirror and praise themselves.</comment>

<comment>I am seeing since past few days, muzzi writers from Kashmir spend lot of time threatening Indian govt about JnK loss on Dailyo and first post websites. It seems like by writing such Bs they will make delhi govt bend....but they are hiding true fact that its PDP who has lost a big face in Kashmir.</comment>

<comment>The BJP has nothing at stake if this alliance does not form the Government again.  In any case BJP will not get seats in the Kashmir area. The loss in Jammu, if what the writer says comes true, will not cause any great upheaval in the BJP's fortunes. J &K was never a state where the BJP could have struck roots and come to power on its own or even with a larger proportion of seats. BJP's reversal in Jammu will not effect its prospects anywhere else either. Hence, it would be better for the BJP to allow Mahbooba to break the alliance rather than hanker after her conditioned support, which she will always use as a weapon of blackmail. Let her suffer her losses in the Kashmir area first..</comment>

Enforce president's rule and stop  all trade with Pakistan until this issue is resolved....And start by throwing off Modi who slept with PDP and release masrat alam....</comment>

<comment>You're asking for the impossible. It won't happen even in a 100 years from now. BJP has shown its true colours in less than 2 years of coming into power. It is useless to expect the secular parties to help the cause of the Pandits. It's a lost cause and we are rightly at the receiving end. We are happy to fight amongst ourselves than tackle bigger problems as this one.</comment>

<comment>Thats the unfortunate problem. Politicians are not magicians and cannot solve problems until people want them to. The problem with this country is we treat them as god and refrain from questioning them. And if others question then, bhakts would start barking. BJP is a ruling party but Modi is not a ruler. He is a public servant that is suppose to hear the people's outcry. Treating his as god is like hiring a janitor and not questioning him on the  garbage.</comment>

<comment>Oh yes. The inability to take criticism against your leader is what's harrowing! If I feel BJP is losing the plot somewhere and make my opinions heard I immediately get told that I'm pro-Congress/AAP.</comment>

<comment>A CAG audit of funds sent to j & k from 1947 till now must be done, nc, congress and pdp all will be caught with their pants down !</comment>

<comment>It is very enlightening to note that the author calls BJP hindu right wing but no similar labels to PDP or NC. Hypocrisy at its best, which is also perpetrated by the media and the other political parties. For those denying their Indian roots, just need to look at their language which is a Indo-Aryan language close to Sanskrit. Kashmiriyat is veiled form of islamism and nothing else. It reinforces the view that Muslims can't co-exist with other communities. The state is totally dependent on Center's aid which is being paid by ordinary Indian tax payers. While on one hand they want money from the center as matter of right at the same time blame the center and India. Shameful !</comment>

<comment>Dear all Why should PDP form the government with BJP now. When this coalition came into being it was for the reason to reunited the three regions of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh, which had seen communal polarization like before in the run up to the election in the state in 2014. One more important reason for this alliance was to help the flood effected people of Jammu and Kashmir rebuild there lives. The verdict was fractured and all the areas of the state had to be taken along, this was the reason Mufti did this alliance.Now political statesmen ship and maturity demanded that BJP which is ruling the centre, should have taken all the steps to make sure the state gets whatever for the rehabilitation of the flood victims. The state government failed, unfortunately, to do that. And people were not effected in Kashmir only that it was PDPs problem, they were effected in Jammu also. No media writes a story on this. But nothing happened.The money which was annoyed my Mr Modi was actually repackaging of the schemes announced by the UPA. almost 85 of the 80,000 crore announced is being now spend on the defense instillation in Jammu and Kashmir, something expected by the Defense Minster himself, now in this circumstance what do to you think the PDP should do?Mehbooba Mufti’s father was publicly humiliated by Mr Modi, and here i want to tell you all, please understand that if nothing India shovel respect the mainstream politicians in the state, because they are much more Indian than those who are sit in Nagpur. They face the wrath of people every day. But the problem in Kashmir is that they were never trusted because India was never concerned about people but land of Kashmir.If people had voted BJP to power to Jammu there was something at play at that time. The things is BJP was supposedly to be a party that would some kind of confidence building measures and talk to Pakistan. understand Kashmir is still a conflict the guns might have stopped firing but the minds have not stopped thing.The policy of deceit followed by New Delhi has been only creating problems for the future of India in Kashmir. Until and unless you start caring about people there is going to resentment against you. This should have happened by strengthening the hands of people who despite a great risk have always supported the idea of India.An Idea of India that failed Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, despite knowing the track record of the PM, he trusted him and hoped the PM would change  things on ground because he had come yup with such a big mandate. But he failed him on every count, he gave him ministers that were totally unaware who they were. they did not knew how to spell a word minister. He was left alone and that consumed him. So do you think Mehbooba still has the reason to go ahead with the alliance.</comment>

<comment>Whatever the Indian government do or did for criminal Islamists in valley thus far since 1947, all the money and goodwill have gone to drain. All we hv ngot is bite in our face. Muslims can never be peaceful unless they have fear of reprisals. When they become majority, first thing will be law n order issues. It is shameful that Islamists have completely ethnically cleansed d valley and communalised it. shame on you communal racists. India should act like other Western nations to cool these criminal goons, who eat at our tax money and sing for our enemy.</comment>

<comment>Jammu  & Ladakh  suffered lot of discrimination and neglect since Independence. Even though Jammu generates more revenue, the representation in J&K Assembly is less. The Valley enjoys the lion's share of development spending. There is no fair play in the Administration. The Valley has largely been purged of its native Hindu population. Article 370 is "as dangerous as cancer" and has been used by power elites and vested interests in bureaucracy, business and the law courts in Srinagar as an instrument of exploitation. The only way to cure cancer is to remove the patient's organs or body parts. The best solution is to make Kashmir a buffer state like Bhutan or a guarded neutrality similar to Switzerland. Scrap Article 370 and grant statehood or UT status for jammu and Ladakh. The status of Hindus in Pakistan is infinitely worse than that of the Muslims in India. So any solution that involves Hindus ending up in Pakistan is far worse than a solution involving Muslims ending up in India. The Pandits have already migrated out of the valley and PDP is not keen on their resettlement. So spending time and money on the Valley is a wasteful exercise</comment>

<comment>Please talk about 1947 when 2 lakh muslims were forced to leave from Jammu. Jammu was a Muslim majority area untill 1974 how did it overnight become Hindu majority area. That was the worst genoise of muslims anywhere in India. and yes if remove Article 370 you will to renegotiate your terms of with state. because that you India constitution provides for. There is nor problem if Jammu is given state hood and Ladakh union territory no problem. if you think these are the areas which are problem you should leave Kashmir's to they own. But one day you would realize all you have done form last 60 years in Kashmir will come and haunt you.</comment>

<comment>In approx 20 - 50 years, fake religion Islam will start dying out. I am not saying that Hinduism is great of something.. but we have the option of finding and making our own path rather than relying on some psycho prophet. Hence end of Islam is inevitable since it relies on some nonsense that someone started rattling.. after that there will be no more wars. But this is the last war to end all wars. Death_to_Islam.</comment>

<comment>Tu 2 lakh muslim ke liye itna bura manta hain... what about you kicking off all Kashmiri pandits from Kasmir? they and their ancestors where living in kasmir even before Mr. Mohammed the Prophet was born? Pehle khud ke g-a-n-d ke neeche andhera dekho bhai.... phir dusro ko dikhao kitna andhera unke g-a-nd ke niche hain</comment>

<comment>The fact is that Jammu and Ladakh today are no more Muslim majority regions. It's a good idea to turn them into UT and free up the valley. Article 370 is an amendment to the Indian constitution and the Indian parliament has the powers to scrap it if needed. The valley could be an independent country supported by India the way we support Bhutan.</comment>

<comment>Sympathy wave definitely for not getting 15 Lakh.</comment>

<comment>Listen understand one thing. Don't expect BJP win seats for obvious reasons. They got only nine months to rule the state. The truth is all these ministers of BJP in coalition government were very new they were still struggling to understand what a minister is supposed to go. If they will time to govern the state may be they would do better than what is the situation for them today. Most of these guys were new and first timers who were still struggling to understand the meaning of what a Minister is supposed to do. Although BJP won't become loser in next election if the coalition continues if it doesn't then understand as a rewind of Jammu i would tell they will lose big time.</comment>

<comment>at max 3 seats. bjp betrayed jammu</comment>

<comment>Don't  fall to pressure from PDP win or no win in j & k fight it out ,bjp need full majority to work better in state can't trust PDP leadership as they are flip-flops on many issue which matter to voters of bjp</comment>

<comment>Full Majority for BJP in J&K .....???? Check your numbers Jammu + Laddkh <<< Kashmir in seats</comment>

<comment>BJP should fight the battle standing firm on the side of Dharma, even if it means losing. Dharma means consistency in action - in alignment to people's expectations and hopes. You may lose a battle or two, but at the end you are sure to win the war.</comment>

<comment>Yes BJP should Sakshi Maharaj , Yogi Aditya Nath and Sadhvi Nirajan in Kashmir Valley as star campaigners (and also they can teach Dharma )</comment>

<comment>better than acting like coughing and doing dramabazi with no result. To hide failures shout on tv cameras and hurl insults at others.</comment>

<comment>Hmmm..... Jumlebazi is also a part of dramabazi</comment>

<comment>We can invite Azhar Masood from across the border instead.</comment>

<comment>Why Azhar Masood !! We have our very own BJP's Masrat Alam</comment>

<comment>You want al-Bhagdhadi?</comment>

<comment>No Masrat Alam is more than enough for getting full seats in Valley for BJP</comment>

<comment>dharma means truth,honesty and transparency, experience. Truth we have seen in vyapam, lalit modi, DDCA , sichai , rice scams and cases.Honesty we know how much BJP leaders are as bangaroo, yedirappa, nishank, jaitley, gadkari etc .transparency we are seeing in swach bharat abhiyan, petrol prices, other failed schemesexperience thrown out as no advani, joshi is there.</comment>

<comment>They are all better than the Congress party leaders who were involved in several mega scams.</comment>

<comment>Go read Bhagavad Gita once more to understand what dharma really means. Assuming we were to accept your definition of dharma, you aren't being honest. Vyapam was a scam that began during Diggi's rule. Lalith Modi was a problem created by Congress. Dharma for you means turn a blind eye to the Scams of congress in 60 years and point a finger at the current government with issues that don't fly. So go try this elsewhere. Not everyone who come to this is a moron, like you.</comment>

<comment>No for sanghis Dharma means  Sakshi Maharaj , Yogi Aditya Nath and Sadhvi Nirajan</comment>

<comment>If there is no sakshi maharaj, yogi and sadhvi....tere jaise will get converted whilst pissing in pants or lungis within no time. you will also sell your own family members to stay alive. I have seen how liberals like you live their life of cowardice.</comment>

<comment>You will also sell your own family members to stay alive !! ----- Well Modi Ji did that ( With his wife , and i dont think the Sanatan Dharma (Non Sanghi Version) in which i believe permits that  --Its called running away from your responsibilities  )</comment>

<comment>Dharma works for people, and not the other way around. </comment>

<comment>"Dharma means consistency in action - in alignment to people's expectations and hopes." Those two are mutually contradictory. Consistency in action is rigid. Then you can't align with people's expectations and hopes which vary and change. Dharma should be flexible and mutable. Only then it can align with people's hopes and expectations. It is not Dharma at war. It is people's expectations and hopes at war. Dharma's goal is to make the people win the war.</comment>

<comment>adherence to Dharma in governance or causing imbalance in the society misusing dharma?</comment>

<comment>Disclaimer (I am a registered BJP Voter) - Dear trolls instead of throwing muck at others or pointing fingers at others energy would be better used for introspection. Think about why were we defeated in Delhi & Bihar. Has anything changed for good within the party? Old saying "Don't burn your bridges"  is apt here. Most who toiled hard for 2014 elections were grossly disrespected these were the guys who got us the amazing victory. Modi wave I really would not agree with it. Think what caused this wave??? A tremor in the ocean bed causes destructive Tsunami. People often never remember that tremor and remember only Tsunami as in this case "Modi Wave" and not who help create it. Neither Modi nor Amit Shah can win single election on their own they need the wave creator who unfortunately they humiliated post victory. Unless they get them back which I doubt they will as ego reigns supreme here they will continue to loose one state after another</comment>

<comment>Modi used Shanghai and Korea pics to sell Gujarat. Now what will he show to sell India ? If they want to be back in power, accept that they made a mistake by opposing GST and FDI in retail as opposition, sack Modi and bring more competitive leadership as PM. Retail Jaitly and Sushma as deputy PM and Home Minister respectively. Only then they can be back in power.</comment>

<comment>Well you are a smarter troll than most congressis I see here. But pretty easy to figure out you are one among them.</comment>

<comment>LoL the modi wave was created by advani, joshi, yashwant, shourie !  Chill, The vote share of BJP is impact and opposition has come together along with unaccounted funds from ford foundation and fatwa of imams, this is the logic behind delhi and bihar !</comment>

<comment>Ye sare tere maa aur behen ka rape karenge bari bari se.</comment>

<comment>They will. Dont worry.</comment>

<comment>It will be a tremendous loss of face and clout of BJP if there is midterm polls in J&K and if it is washed away in Jammu. There are several mistakes of local MLAs and Ministers of BJP in Jammu region and they are largely perceived as failures by the public. Also, Mehbooba may manage to do well playing the victim card as BJP has not delivered on Agenda of Alliance promises. She has already raised the bar by asking Modi personally to deliver on all promises given in the Agenda and his last Kashmir rally. She may also get the benefit of Mufti's goodwill if there is midterm polls. J&K is surely not voting for Congress and NC is still not out of the bad will earned in its last regime. If however this is NC+Congress+ Panthers' Party alliance, it may clear majority.</comment>

<comment>For sure she will use her fathers death as card in the elections, you are spot on.</comment>

<comment>Comments make an interesting reading. When BJP is diminishing its supporters resort to abuse,</comment>

<comment>Some Indians are experts in posting off topic comments.  Read some of them below.</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal should immediately set aside fifty crores of Delhi development funds to help run a political campaign in Kashmir and better yet, he should stand for elections in J and K..Khulji, would you care to oblige us? After all, you swore that you would hand kashmir back to pakistan so they would love you,definitely.Care to move base to kashmir? Please do,we have had enough pleasure of your..er company for a while now and frankly, we delhites need a break..</comment>

<comment>You have gone mad indeed. Kejriwal talk in Jammu and Kashmir politics. Huh! God save you. And, you are a Berliner. How are you bothered with Delhi or Kashmir?</comment>

<comment>Now, now, alleged prof, if you really are one for we have our doubts seeing the moronic reply you had posted - anyway moving on, Kejriwal should really go and set  up base  in kashmir,given his penchant for supporting terrorists and pakistan, he will win the elections hands down..I guess your abuses  are on account of my speaking the inconvenient truth..Figures,Pfffft</comment>

<comment>This WE you talk about is the dwindling band of paid Bhakts. Who are running helter skelter due to continuous decline of BJP from Delhi to Bihar, Gujarat to Maharashtra local polls, and now crises in J&K with PDP and off-on with Shiv Sena in Mumbai. What should Kejriwal do let him decide. He is smarter than us. Or else you won't be writing these stupid lines, and I won't be replying to you taking you seriously. Huh! And for your 'alleged professor' part, have replied online many times (from Symbiosis, Amity, to Mumbai Univ, Unitedworld, enough). Abuses? Bhakts have a monopoly of the same.</comment>

<comment>Why do you believe that J and K is not a part of India. The fact is Kejriwal is AFRAID to go into J and K because just like in Gujarat his candidate will get 42 votes</comment>

<comment>J&K is surely part of India and will remain so. But a politician will decide his strategy as per his organization and political situation. Even Mayavati or Mulayam or Jaylalitha or Naveen Patnaik or Paswan does not need to go to J&K for political purpose. As for AK in Gujarat, forget LS polls (that was in 2014). BJP just heavily lost (80%) in rural and semi urban Gujarat in local self governing bodies polls recently. Worry about that. You find AK in everything shows HOW MORTALLY you guys are afraid of AK, and that proves his political impact. You guys make him the Hero. He should be thankful to these blind Bhakts who see AK in everything in the world.</comment>

<comment>these bhakts are suffering from mental disorder. their main problem emanates from the poor/non performance of their govt. and their own reluctance to face the reality.</comment>

<comment>On the dot. Bull's eye.</comment>

<comment>BJP strategy.  Distract the masses by1. Throw dirt on opponents2. Start a communal violence3. Religious debate , caste debate, pick a mosque and threaten to bring it down4. Let loose their motor mouths5. Let loose their vanar sena6. Destabilize states which were relatively peaceful</comment>

<comment>Khuli has no balls to do it, he is a castrated dog !</comment>

<comment>The Vatican is extremely unhappy that its forced religious conversion programme has been halted and the Gujarat Hriday Samrat defeated all of its sinister designs and became Bharat Hriday Samrat. That is why there is so much of hatred against Modi and they tried to implicate him falsefully in 2002 riots, efforts to tarnish his image and defeat his govt are in full swing. Pre$$titutes are fed daily from the hands of Church. As per the Church, Muslims in India should never be allowed to support BJP. Church needs the Muslim support to defeat hindus and convert everyone to christianity.The Church is working against the will of Jesus by converting everyone. The Pope had said, we forcefully converted and planted the cross in europe and north america in first millenium, South america, australia and africa in the second millenium and now is the turn of Asia and especially India and China. That is why china has banned him and china says one more christian = one less chinese as they are brain washed by the pedophile, homosexual and r@pist fathers and archibishops and turn them into anti nationals</comment>

<comment>Any connection to the article above? None.</comment>

<comment>Has connection with the pre$$titutes who are misleading people !</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal is like a castrated dog, he has no balls to talk about Malda riots, ISIS, corruption of Sonia Pariwar, went to Dadri to consolidate secular vote bank, 400 page corruption document against Sheila Dikshit is buried along with Lokpal bill under the AAP office !--` When asked about Pathankot attacks, Malda riots, ISIS he replied saying that he would not comment on happenings outside Delhi and he is the CM of Delhi ! And now to Hyderabad asking PM to resign !</comment>

<comment>Farmer Gajendra who committed suicide in the AAP rally is haunting kejriwal, he is also a dalit !</comment>

<comment>AAP's Vikaspuri MLA Mahinder Yadav was arrested on Friday under various charges including rioting and assaulting public servant during a protest against the arrest of an alleged sexual offender, the sixth lawmaker from the ruling party in Delhi to be arrested. He was supporting the rapist of the 3 year old baby !</comment>

<comment>he should learn from snoopy dogs how to escape?</comment>

<comment>So much for BJP's agenda of good governance. Don't expect Modi to solve every issue.</comment>

<comment>AAPtards have lost the trust and credibility of the people of Delhi completely. Now no one listens to them. Their drama over 'fight against corruption' is similar to a pr@stitute fighting for virginity. Nobody cares a hoot for them, so wherever there is a news item aaptards quickly login and show their frustration on that forum making unverifiable baseless accusations against non AAPtards ! Earlier Delhiites used to say with pride 'paanch saal kejriwal', now after Kejriwal showed his true colours and betrayed them, they are saying ' l@-ude ka ball kejribal' !.-</comment>

<comment>Self-serving BJPee is like a Pr0stiute willing to sleep with any body if it serves its monetary and political purpose !!  Ideology and principles be damned which are the lexicon of the absurd and the faithfuls to dope the masses !!</comment>

<comment>The alliance between PDP and BJP was against people's mandate to begin with as both had fought bitterly against each other and both won seats from only one region each. Both should stop the drama and form the govt immediately or call for elections without any delay. Both will get a taste of reality then.</comment>

<comment>two anti nationals talking of national agenda. hypocrisy of the lowest order.</comment>

<comment>Why can not two nationals talk of national agenda?</comment>

<comment>So, Mufti and Mehbooba have become Nationalists for the Bhakths !?  Ha Ha Ha Ha !!  Do you mean Kashmiri Nationalism ?  I cannot control my laughter !!</comment>

<comment>You really are stupid. Are you not? Where did I use the word 'nationalists'. I said two nationals which two persons belonging to the same nation. Keep on laughing your stupid laugh.</comment>

<comment>If there is a manifestation of unholy nexus in Politics- the PDP BJP Combine stands for it literally, figuratively and obviously. PDP has always favored separatists, extremists and were never amenable to the Indian State. Its a symbol of muslims and Kashmir ValleyBJP always favored nationalism, patriotism and is a symbol of Hindus and in JK the Jammu region.There is no common ground whatsoever. Even a school kid will understand that.The alliance was always tumultuous and the Mufti's death gave both parties the time to rethink. I dont think the BJP is stupid enough to sacrifice their identity for power again. They have done once, doing it again will wipe them out of JK for sure but also will have a cascading effect in other areas.</comment>

<comment>no the people of india</comment>

<comment>Please be careful when you mention Pakistan, it now includes feku in Lahore.</comment>

<comment>No, I'm a sickular jehadi AAPTard!</comment>

<comment>The alliance between BJP and PDP was doomed to fail given the wide gulf between the interests they represent. It will be in the best interests of all concerned if President's Rule is imposed for an year after which fresh elections can be held.</comment>

<comment>BJP is being targeted very heavily at the slightest opportunity. As Congress was never really expected to deliver in their 60 years of rule of corruption and apathy, people never complained this loud. Now, the whole pre$$titutes are against the BJP on each and every small issue.</comment>

<comment>Yeah because loud mouths like shah and modi are in BJP. loud mouth every promise to select groups and after 19 months rename UPA schemes!Targeted? yes because of loud moth promises.. BTW no one asked them to promise, they jumped up to promise for votes</comment>

<comment>Sahi baat hai...</comment>

<comment>Exactly..If anybody watches Indian Media they will think that before 2014 - Everybody in India was driving Ferrari & then MODI came & took it back</comment>

<comment>No dear, we were happy with what we had expecting something better.... then came fekuchand and gang and said we will give each of u a ferrari.... ppl believed him and forgot about his past sins..... now after 2 years... forget Ferrari, we dont even have petrol to ride our bikes ... and to add insult to injury .. tadipaar shah says it was ur problem u believed us.... we were doing jumla baazi</comment>

<comment>Your words reflect that u are a paid hatemonger.</comment>

<comment>Bang on..!!!</comment>

<comment>You want everything right here right now... where was your sense of urgency for the last 60 years... ??</comment>

<comment>Dont blame me dear... ask the feku and gang</comment>

<comment>Your sky high expectations only convince me that you have more faiths in the PM then the Bhakts..</comment>

<comment>dont be so desperate ..... hold on ...</comment>

<comment>Its ok to be critical of govt.. but your comment show  another level of hatred ...  n of course you are entitled  to your opinion but please tell us how RAGA or AK r better options...</comment>

<comment>Well said</comment>

<comment>it is 19 months now since Mr Modi came to power. Stop blaming others now for his failures.</comment>

<comment>What do you want? new porsches for everyone? that's success??</comment>

<comment>is that what you wanted during UPA?</comment>

<comment>Lack of success is not equivalent to failure. Sixty years of Congress misrule will need more than 19 months to be wiped away.</comment>

<comment>once gain the same excuse, go see what is the result of misrule in Gujarat by Mr Modi.</comment>

<comment>is that why Mr Modi is copying all UPA schemes only, latest being his u-turn on MNREGA?</comment>

<comment>Ah come on! Quit talking about the 60 year misrule. The finance minister just 24 hours back praised their MGNREGA!</comment>

<comment>Dont't worry congi's , Appy's and Mullah's about BJP and it chances, It will take care of its own. Let the President rule be there for next 5 years and Kashmir should be under Army's rule for ever . Only elections should be held in Jammu and ladakh and then these Mullah maroons will be taught a lesson.</comment>

<comment>Only an idiot and who has no empathy for the people of JK can write like this. what are you a slave of BJP or Modi that you forget even basic humanity in your blind love for them? Do you know what will happen under Army rule and Governor's rule. People like you have supported such alienation of the people in JK for years.</comment>

<comment>Pandits are the original inhabitators of Kashmir. The fake Kashmiris should be deported to deserts of Saudu arabia.</comment>

<comment>I am really surprised to read this article and some of the comments here. It's been just 9months for this govt for god's sake!!! 9 months!...so, people expect nothing from congress for 65yrs and expect BJP to deliver in 9months! Either impatience at best, or those who hv not voted for BJP are the ones commenting here.</comment>

<comment>What kind of relief was provided to the Pandits during the six year tenure of Vajpayee !?</comment>

<comment>Really? The difference between BJP and Congress is that the loud mouthed Modi, Shah and BJP trumpeted themselves so much about all grandiose things themselves. BTW No one asked them to. Do try and search about "buried under own expectations". The more the expectation setting, the sooner the burial will happen. It took congress 60 years but for BJP the timeperiod is shortened because of their own doing.</comment>

<comment>Some of the paid mullahs are throwing venom on modi and BJP by changing their names here. Actual situation is very much different in the ground.</comment>

<comment>Just like the situation in Bihar? The sooner we wake up from this delusion the better it is. We all thought Delhi was an aberration (including me) but Bihar proved that BJP has lost the mojo and that all the state elections in 2014 were won solely on the Modi wave. It has diminished rapidly and the ground reality is that people are yet to see positive development on the ground. Worst is the inability of the incumbent government to communicate their achievements with the common man. Mann Ki Baat has become a 'waste of time' with no concrete actions/steps taken to educate people on the ills affecting the country. Sitting in front of a computer I can prepare the best speech ever but it all comes down to action. Unfortunately this government is lacking in that department. Very surprising that Modi and the likes have refused to learn from the Atal-era debacle that communicating the achievements with the common man is the one fool proof way of securing votes in the future elections. They have done zilch in that respect. Ironically the media management team of Modi and BJP during the run up to the 2014 elections were going all guns blazing! I doubt such an approach in 2019 would work. Opposition will finish off BJP without even firing a bullet thanks to the incompetence of the incumbent government.</comment>

<comment>PDP will win most of the seats in Kashmir, riding on the sympathy of Mufti's demise. In the last elections it lost four seats in south Kashmir and they are expected even to win these seats back from Congress. I think every one is forgetting that Congress would do much better job in Jammu than National Conference. BJP doesn't stand a chance for reasons it commonly polarized the three regions of the state. That communal card has not sustained and people have yarned for development in the region. The thing is Prof from Jammu is right, BJP doesn't stand a chance if the election were to be held in next six months in the state. They failed to win a seat in Kashmir valley but Jammu they won it was election between Narendra Modi vs rest, if the state  BJP leaders were be to pitted against the rest they would have lost their deposits.   Truth in the BJP leaders who were grass root leaders have all been sidelined by new leadership for the reason better known to them. In Jammu, were i live, not even a single BJP leader who was associated with previously and was a visible face of party  is no longer in party. I am not sure what would happen to PDP in Kashmir but if you go by the regional newspapers they would even lost seats in north Kashmir.If the PDP would lose elections, if the mid term polls were to be conducted, bale it non other than its finance minister. He lied about the package, he lied to Mufti and to the people of Kashmir, for the reasons, there are rumors he was promised a job by BJP as Governor of RBI. If he stands for his election from his constituency he would lose the despite. I am sure all the ministers in the previous government which ruled the state for nine months would lose the elections. BJP win in last elections was charisma of Modi that played well in Jammu. It was and will remain a non entity in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir.</comment>

<comment>Stop this bogus ploy here, it is not ur ISIS playground.</comment>

<comment>Dude get a life man! Anyone who opposes modi is not a mullah or Paki. This bigoted and parochial mindset will be your doom, watch out!</comment>

<comment>the biggest paki sympathiser nowdays is the santa claus who was seen roaming on the streets of lahore on Christmas with gifts for birthday boy and the bride</comment>

<comment>both the core voters of PDP and BJP have realized how they were betrayed. so in the coming elections, both the parties will get hurt, and NC may come back. so it will be better if both of them restitch their failed alliance.</comment>

<comment>The people of Jammu are literally vexed with the untrustworthy  BJPee  which has failed to honour its electoral promise of resettlement and rehabilitation of the Pandits who panickingly  fleed from the Kashmir valley and have been made refugees in their own land. Neither the erstwhile Vajpayee Government honoured its promise to the Pandits nor the current Feku Government which has been tall on promises but not even lilliputian in implementation.   What has made the radicals in the Jammu region  more aghast is its wholly unprincipled and opportunistic alliance with the PDP which it had earlier castigated as Pro-Pakistan and Seperatist party in all its platforms of public interaction and media briefings !!So it will not be a surprise if the BJPee is reduced to fine dust if snap polls are held !!That said, even now, you cannot rule out a compromise between both these unscrupulous parties at the last minute as they are seeking more time from the Governor who ofcourse will be delighted to grant them.  A lot of shady dealings might be worked out from behind the scene with the pernicious and malicious intent of personal profiteering while craftily veiling  this impulsive induldgence with the veneer of working up on the agenda of governance to yet again bamboozle the gullible masses !!So it is better to wait and watch the drama as it unfolds as the desperate Politicos might stitch up an arrangement at the last moment to claim it as a victory for Jammu and Valley regions !!</comment>

<comment>BJP will get morethan 30 seats if elections are held today in JnK</comment>

<comment>Mission 44+ will be achieved</comment>

<comment>Well, the decimation  of your party in   Delhi and Bihar hasn't still taught you guys any good lesson !!  Ofcourse, you always have the liberty to  dream !!</comment>

<comment>But, victories in much larger states like Maharashtra and Haryana has given much more confidence.</comment>

<comment>in your dreams. Let it pull out and see for itself.</comment>

<comment>Yasir Mian, please don't worry about BJP and India ! If Jammu and Ladakh are separated out, Kashmir put under army rule and all Indian funding stopped - think what wiill happen to your stone pelting brothers !</comment>

<comment>Were is that Modi wave gone, someone please tell me. The RSS chadies who helped BJP to win the election in 2014 assembly election have left for their homes from Jammu. Now tera kai hoga kalia. Congress and AAP will make sure you are decimated from the map of Jammu and Kashmir, like your Shama prasad Mukherjee was by NC.</comment>

<comment>AAP? You means Khujliwal the Cheat Minister of Delhi? come on kid grow up. I am sure you are using fake name and you must be Paki</comment>

<comment>Modi and the BJP are going to the there whether you like it or not, upto 2019.  So pl stop this day dreaming.  As for Late Mufti, his daughter and their party, every one know that they are pally with the secessionists.  Congress is expert at double games, and all have seen through them.  So dear, no choice left other than NC, BJP or at the worst PDP.  Congress and PDP winning in Jammu and Ladakh is ruled out.</comment>

<comment>yeah why the heck did Modi and BJP wearing the nationalism and hinduism on their sleeve ever agree for power sharing with PDP - when you know they are pally with secessionists. Was it blind desire for power or lust for power? Either which way, the BJP flight has crash landed even before take off in JK. Congress was and is a political party that has its own agenda and they have paid the price for it. Why justify BJP actions citing congress, like that demented sambit patra. Ask him anything on BJP, he will with his irritatingly shrill voice say- congress did it.. grow up guys, the country is now far more smarter!</comment>

<comment>Dear u can keep sailing in ur dreams..... if they were pally with secesesionists , why were feku and gang sleeping with them ? and no u r wrong.... we really want these pack of jokers to stay till 2019... coz every passing day the aura of theirs and any semblance of governance is coming down..... so let this continue till 2019 and we can be rest assured we wont ever see the face of feku again.... just like the previous PM of the jumla party</comment>

<comment>AAP is irrelevant in kashmir.</comment>

<comment>The author is basically putting pressure on BJP to accept PDP conditions. The dominance of valley must continue, thats the message.</comment>

<comment>What do you think should happen. It i like Instead of Centre keeping Delhi police we should allow i tot go to AAP hands. Kashmir will have always politically better placed than Jammu.</comment>

<comment>U apptards want delhi police wear ur white caps and help u to make dharna day in day out</comment>

<comment>Also respect the sentiments of the people of jammu and Ladakh, considered as colonies of Kashmir due to  the stupid Article 370. The Union Territory status for Ladakh was a long-standing demand. The best solution is to make Kashmir a buffer state like Bhutan or a guarded neutrality similar to Switzerland. Scrap Article 370 and grant statehood or UT status for jammu and Ladakh. The status of Hindus in Pakistan is infinitely worse than that of the Muslims in India. So any solution that involves Hindus ending up in Pakistan is far worse than a solution involving Muslims ending up in India.</comment>

<comment>If people of J & K want NC and Congees back, it's their funeral.And if Jammu people don't vote for BJP, again, they would be the loosers.It's not like when other parties were governing Jammu was a heaven....Polarized voters are now so easily swayed...Look at how muslims will never vote for BJP..Similarly, why would Hindus of Jammu vote for muslim parties?</comment>

<comment>so hindu bjp and muslim pdp can't get along with compromises on both sides and a common minimum programme. I do worry about the future of J&K and of India too.</comment>

<comment>And you can't hide ur glee with the prospect of disaster for bjp</comment>

<comment>Nice analysis but sorry I do not see the bjp coming off worse, they would have to rework the old faces in and would be set to gain in Jammu. On the contrary it is the PDP which would be worse off, starting with the inordinate delay. And here's the flip  side to the whole article, both NCP and congress are set to take a larger hit in the valley for the resentment against their mismanagement and scams, not to mention misgovernance still ranks high even today</comment>

<comment>nonsense !!! .... bjp will win in jammu .. anyway muslims dont vote them in kashmir</comment>

<comment>yes just like they did in delhi and bihar.......... ppl have understood that they have basically elected a tourist in place of a PM</comment>

<comment>Even Hindus won't now. So please Shut up</comment>

<comment>shut down !</comment>
