<comment>Dear Pappu,All Indians know you as Mr. Pappu because the acts whatever you were doing shows that. Shame on yourself to be called as future leader of India and leading such a huge party.If you are an Indian and you really concerned about the students or let's take it as AFJAL GURU, you fight for him and try to get the justice in the right way. Again before doing that you should take on your party as everything happened during the UPA rule. But you whatever you are doing by backing the group of illiterates who are raising such slogans against my Country (If you accept yourself as Indian) is not acceptable.If your only concern is to raise your vote bank over this row, you are not the right person to lead my Nation and you will never become a Leader.Last but not least as a prompt Tax payer in the country, I'm very much disappointed by the things happening in the JNU and shame on us to have such a group of students (anti social elements) educated on our money.</comment>

<comment>ISIS, I do not know who you are and where you live, but if you are listening, then please take away #RG #AmulBoy with you. I assure you have the mandate of over half the Indian citizens to do whatever you want to.</comment>

<comment>Useless fellow. His family destroyed India for 60yrs with such divisive politics</comment>

<comment>Not vote bank Pappu this time is trying to impress Pakistan. He wants maintain good relation with our  goatfuc@#ng neighbour</comment>

<comment>Pappu actually acts like a robot. Doesn't have his own brain. His brain is rotten</comment>

<comment>Entire communist party along with Pappu and kujliwal shud be dumped in Syria. </comment>

<comment>Pappu ko Syria bej do. Woh mansik tor se bhimar hai.  </comment>

<comment>This guy has no idea or intellectual capacity of his own and would like to somehow catapult himself through other's ideas and protests. BJP again going to get 2nd term full majority if thsi guy and commies are not standing with the govt. on valid issues and oppose the govt. for the sake of opposition. Land Acquistion Bill ok. Why GST? Opposition needs to answer</comment>

<comment>In Syria, ISIS is facing a shortfall of people they can torture and then behead...Please ship Kanhaiya Kumar and others who want India ki Barbadi to Syria...In fact, their entire extended family should be shipped to Raqqa</comment>

<comment>Citizens of India,  please remember that this VP of Congress supports  and encourages students wanting "BHARAT KI BARBADI" ...when next time you go and vote in ANY election . ..Do Not Forget !!</comment>

<comment>Rahul is a great prop for the Congress puppet masters...they use him to grind their own axes...he anyways, is "mentally negligible"...he didn't have time when Malda exploded</comment>

<comment>Rahul Gandhi (pappu) crushes himself, there is no need for others to target Pappu</comment>

<comment>If Freedom of expression allows "Bharat ki barbadi" on JNU, should we also accept Idiotic, Stupid, Nonsensical Statements by politicians like1. "rape is just a small thing"2. Boys are boys3. All muslims are terrorists4. All brahmins are blood suckers5. All dalits are slaves6. All christians are Conversion terroristsetc etc. Will the same commie support these statements in the name of freedom of expression?</comment>

<comment>This Pappu has no idea what he is doing, the only way they can cover their faces is by spreading a fake video with voiceover of ABVP student protesting against the Anti-National scums.</comment>

<comment>Vote ke liye saala kuch bhi kahega.</comment>

<comment>These parties are bent upon creating another partition of India  with the support of Pakistan . This moron's brain even at 45 is not developed fully . He is supporting students who want to destroy the country . After all Italian aulad .</comment>

<comment>Does rahul know that j nehru was his grandpa and afzal was hanged by his mothers govt</comment>

<comment>Many Indian Army soldiers lost their lives fighting against terrorism (Afzal Guru etc) - RG & Congress are now reduced to this issue to exploit to get back to power. What a shame.</comment>

<comment>This overgrown Kid, Does not know what he is talking about. He is encouraging the anti nationals who were protesting against the UPA Gov't who sent Afzal Guru to the gallows. It ws the same at HCU where again the protest was against the UPA for hanging Yakub. It was the NDA which took action against these protesters. Not realizing this fact , this fool of a person is supporting these anti national protesters. He seems to have forgotten that he is a Congress leader. The problem with this kid is he gets worked up at any incident and rushes to the venue, just to project himself as a concerned leader in the people's view. When he decides to visit such venues, he asks his joker advisers to give him he script. Having to perform at short notice all the advisers send their check sheets. This kid immediately on receipt mixes up all the advises, adds some stock words from his previous statements and delivers his speech, making a fool of himself. But the most laughable feature of his irrelevant, immature and out of context delivery is the sad story of a gang of politicians supporting his cause. In all his outings, he had the support of politicians turned jokers, like- Yechury, AK, Nitish, Didi and their followers. In JNU we had the added presence of Jokers like anand Sharma and Maken. The whole world is laughing at these jokers.</comment>

<comment>Dear pappu,When trying to snack on corpses which you have shown a preference for, of late - you may want to ask your script writers to come up with some originality instead of rehashing what you spoke at Hyderabad Uni..more to the point, pappu, your party alone did not fight the british but all of India did..And while you are at it, they would be shocked to see a pappu like yourself batting for anti national elements like this..which is why I personally think it is great that you and the congress came out batting for these anti national parasites for it makes it patently clear to all that the congress is and will always be an anti national party. We have seen it in action, destroying all of India, swindling it blind to the point of bankruptcy and now this..to morons like you, national interest, security and sovereignty are taboo terms, are they not?Either way, please continue snacking on corpses, maggot ridden parasite, for we have no intention of letting anyone forget just how anti national the congress and its B parties, like aap, and left truly are and come next election, the people would soon realize that even forty four seats is fourty four too many to hand over to anti national elements like yourself..It is, and will always be India first and those who think otherwise will be crushed underfoot, period</comment>

<comment>Shame on Rahul. What are these guys doing. Just for politics.</comment>

<comment>These guys have stooped so low that they will not hesitate to sell the country for few votes.</comment>

<comment>Rahul, to use PG Wodehouse's phrase, is "mentally negligible" I have not come across a single statement from him that gives any evidence of even average intelligence; his only qualification to rule this nation is his surname/the family - fortunately the common voter has moved beyond the "One Family; One Nation" (unlike the congress slaves who are still hoping that they can pillion-ride on the family, come to power and loot merrily and shamelessly) Rahul, or for that matter JNU, Arvind & Commies never open their mouth when our Army personnel are martyred: for a few votes (appeasing you know who) they can sell their motherland without an iota of conscience. What is amusing or rather appalling is that this specimen with zero intelligence thinks that he can rule us one day!!! His comment " "They do not understand that by crushing you they are making you stronger. They are terrified of weak Indian people raising their voice," reminds me of Emergency and how the "weak Indian people" raised their voice and crushed Congress. Now it is a pathetic 44 party with a set of stooges, slaves and unpatriotic thugs; it has still not learnt the lesson. Just waiting for the day when Congress is wiped clean out of Indian political scenario.</comment>

<comment>two weeks ago rahul was in hyderabad  university playing the dalit card yesterday hewas in jnu  playing the sickular card  and left liberalism   desperate attempts  for creating a vote bank</comment>

<comment>What secular card ????? He played the anti-national card !!!</comment>

<comment>He knows that he is going to be decimated in the next elections. So he needs the support of the jholawalas (Communists) who are anyway reduced to 15-20 MPs in PArliament. Low level politics being displayed by tourist politician, who land everywhere there is a controversy without ascertaining the facts.</comment>

<comment>Subject: ANTI NATIONAL UNIVERSITY MASQUERADING AS INTELLECTUAL THINK TANKTo: dr_acad@mail.jnu.ac.in, dr_admin@mail.jnu.ac.in, secy.dhe@nic.inRegistrars JNU,Your awful university is wasting taxpayers money and hosting and supporting anti national activities, because of spineless officials like you and your vice chancellor.  In his appearance itself he looks like 'namak haraam' who would sell his mother to keep his position.Freedom of expression is contingent to ensuring unity and integrity of the nation.  Please read the preamble of the Indian Constitution, which I am sure that you anti-national elements have not read.You sit in the heart of our country and become silent observers to the anti national slogans and shamelessly take high emoluments at our expense and pretend to be intellectual which in fact you are cowards, who would sell the nation and hide under your tables when anti national shameless uncouth and sick criminals who masquerade as students start barking anti national slogans in front of you.  Your ineffectiveness while your criminal students lionize a terrorist; Afzal Guru, is enough to make you a complicit and subject to sedition charge.Pathetic and helpless looks of your vice chancellor, who is supporting and abetting anti national activities at the campus shows him as a pliable person who would succumb to pressure and would willingly subjugate himself to any menial service to any oppressor,  to earn his daily bread.SHAME! SHAME AND SHAME.  If you have any ounce of moral conscience left in you I am sure all three of you would resign.  I have no doubt your shameless breed would continue to cling to your chairs and continue to shame our country feeding your wife and children with the money of the taxpayers that you thieve from us.Secretary of Higher Education.  I did not find the email address of the Union Minister for HRD hence I am writing this email to you.  Please ensure you show it to the Cabinet Minister and take action against the spineless officials at university.Any true Indian would not tolerate anti-national activity in our country.</comment>

<comment>Correctly said.The name can be chsnged to ANU to mran anti national university</comment>

<comment>no buddy you are wrong. The name of the university is the FITTING name for activities it encourages.there cant be any suitable name other than the current one.</comment>

<comment>Pappu Bhaiya also supports anti India terrorist sympathizers. How low can these Congressi guys stoop for petty political points. Even start supporting anti national elements just because they are opposed to Modi? Tomorow if HAfiz Saeed or MAsood Azhar attack the BJP / Modi (verbally), Rahul Pappu will start supporting them too? This guy has no original ideas, no plan for the country. His only agenda is anti modi rhetoric, even if he has to support India haters for the same. Shame on you COngress VP. Shame on you.</comment>

<comment>What a blessing this duffer is. May you live long. And ensure congress dies a slow and painful death. </comment>

<comment>This is pretty insane....apne pappu ji is supporting Bharat is barbaadi' n expects Indians to make him PM !! He really needs a psychiatrist ;0</comment>

<comment>Secularest leader is back to save anti nationals...One more feather in cap why dont he ever support any gud cause which has nothing to do with politics.</comment>

<comment>rahul gandhi is now supporting anti nationals.....and congress wants him to be prime minister of india????God save india from rahul gandhi...A guy who can support anti nationals will even sell his country...</comment>

<comment>Why were leftists associated with secessionists? There is no circumlocution. I am just coming back to sad reality of culture of socialist legal robbery manifesting itself as secessionism - because the socialists may have realized it is impossible to come to an understanding on who the supreme dictator should be and they want to establish numerous single part dictatorships over fragments of country.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------India is the only nation in world where teachers are murdered by students. There is a film in Kannada "Nagarahavu" where a useless student murders his teacher. Indian people, Socialist legal robbers, consider him a hero! A remake in Hindi was Zehrila Insan - I have not watched the Hindi version and I dont know if it exact copy of Nagarahavu. The problem is, India is an Ocholocracy[mob rule] where Individual rights are murdered[example is murder of merit an Individual right by reservation policy and property rights by socialism. Socialism is legal robbery.A period of good dictatorship may be required to cure Indians of disease of bad democracy, due to the infection of socialism or legal robbery. Otherwise bad democracy can kill in millions like in Cambodia under Pol Pot. Ocholocracy looks like democracy but it is not - 30 years of no elections, even if it means lot of blood shed will do India good. Just look at immorality of Indians- Laloo the reason for largest migration of Biharis from Bihar was reelected.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anti-Brahmin comment from possible Pakistani spies like , Kali Kutty, shows that it is anti-national to attack brahmins[modern dalits].</comment>

<comment>This guy has audacity to tell it is India's greatness to raise anti national slogans.  He should be put in mental asylm </comment>

<comment>Naivete for Rahul"s naivete....wouldn't he be suing if someone called him a terrorista and his  Columbian ex girlfriend a drug pusher...his mother is of Mafia lineage ? What kind of dissent is it if someone so blatantly slanders his own country?</comment>

<comment>This is clearly misuse of freedom of speech & sedition,if they hate this nation so much why they are in India  go and join terrorist camp in azad Kashmir.It is happening because they are more into politics than education.It is fashionable to oppose establishment.</comment>

<comment>Let RG expose himself his negativity for our nation by doing such support of anti nationals. He thinks that it was 1980/1990...ppl are watching him and give the strong reply in 2019 elections.YOU never become PM of India this is for sure and congress buried long back.</comment>

<comment>This man Rahul and his cronies really believe that he is the one to rule India. Being out of power, now this guy is man become low of the low politician to have it back!</comment>

<comment>He thinks he is aristocracy  hence statement that waving black flag at him is a great achiement for Indian common man </comment>

<comment>So, his family has been robbing us to make us RICHER too???</comment>

<comment>Whatever Pappu has been smoking, or what he got from Myanmar, is really good stuff. The poor bloke feels the Nehru burden on his shoulders that they are born to rule over India.  Hehe, what a joke. A billion people are standing behind him waiting for their chance to kick his behind...</comment>

<comment>Hindus of kerala please note , what this christian is trying to tell the nation*( sedition ) , as u are about to vote shortly</comment>

<comment>I tell you,there are more than billion people in country who believe what you believe in and standing right behind you,- idiotic statement , how can 1 billion people out of 1.2 stand behind their own country's down fall ( after all bharat ki bar badi was the slogan ) - appu u also get a new  proof reader ( other one is FP )</comment>

<comment>He himself first believe what he says   aaaaallllll nautanki</comment>

<comment>Joker</comment>

<comment>Now anti-nationals, traitors, seperatists, intellectuals, Award Bapasi brigades ranks are getting swollen by Congis (aka Congress, Khangress, Scamgress), Leftists and their vote bank turn coats. These ranks have their associates like Let, JuD, Hahiz Sayeed in Pakistan also. In India, this group can be headed by Rahul (fake Gandhi) Khan.</comment>

<comment>“Bharat ki Barbadi tak Kashmir ki Aadi tak jung karenge jung karenge; Bharat ke solah tukrade honge Insa Allah Insa Allah; Kitne Afzal maroge har ghar se Afzal niklega; Afzal hi hatya nahi sahenge nahi sahenge, halla bol halla bol, ladkar lenge Azadi, cheen kar lenge Azadi, Azadi Azadi, Pakistan Zindabad, Pakistan Zindabad…"Rahul save some grace for next election, do not try our patience... Do not be so despo your mom wd die of heart attack if you come out to be such a stupid, shooting your own foot.Next time you wd carry a visitor pass to enter parliament.It's great going rahul you best kept out of national duty.</comment>

<comment>Was not the UPA  in power when Afzal Guru was hanged?</comment>

<comment>Support from Pakistan will make you weaker Rahul Gandhi</comment>

<comment>retard..preaches sht and practices sht</comment>

<comment>Why is this joker saying a billion people are with those traitors? No Pappu we are against these retards. Cheapest form of politics to support anti-national elements just because of his hatred towards Modi</comment>

<comment>Rahul is bent upon digging congress's grave. All the best. People are watching.</comment>

<comment>Whats happened to you Rahul?Rahul why are you supporting antinationals?Our jawans will be so ashamed of you!You should rise above politics and support PM.I really cannot believe that you have stooped to such low level!</comment>

<comment>At least get the name of ABVP right, FP</comment>

<comment>Dumbo like RaGa is the key reason for Congress' fall to disgrace. With his intellect showing no sign of improvement even with passing age and receding hairline, India doubts whether his "views" & "advises" are taken seriously even within his own party!</comment>

<comment>Seriously? Rahul baba went to express solidarity with anti nationals who raised slogans against India? Wow!!! What a shame.</comment>

<comment> pappu pip pip karta hain aur koi nahi sunta uska. ch000tiya kahin ka</comment>

<comment>I like your comments...I wish India had more Indians like you and lesser of the JNU type...</comment>

<comment>Congress is in alliance with communists for Bengal polls when it had choice between BJP or Mamatha. CPI and congress are in ideological agreement on socialism. Congress and CPI, largest communist party imposed Single party dictatorship of emergency.</comment>

<comment>In his quest for opposing modi on everything...Rahul Gandhi has taken the wrong bait....bjp should now heat up this</comment>

<comment>Pappu the duffer has walked into a trap of his own making. Jolly. </comment>

<comment>after the circus in hyderabad rahul takes part in the jnu circus with one point agenda how to create a vote bank of commies and anti nationals</comment>

<comment>Before that it was FTII circus. 45 year old youth (duffer) Leader</comment>

<comment>rahul gandhi probably has not bothered to know that this institute in the name of his great grand father like hundreds of other institutes named after this lame duck prime minister has survived aimlessly  on tax payers money</comment>

<comment>Shut up ragas abusers. It is not his fault papas cond@# tore. </comment>

<comment>Pappu is also supporting the communist anti national students. Big vote bank.  Real master piece. </comment>

<comment>I fully support Pappu, he is ensuring death for Congress... Keep it up Papu, its almost done.</comment>

<comment>His aim is winning the heart of his vote bank(Muslims/Christians)</comment>

<comment>Will this not consolidate the Hindu vote?</comment>

<comment>He is playing caste politics there. Hyderabad was example.</comment>

<comment>There are too many contenders wooing this vote bank. It will split. </comment>

<comment>Why Sakshi Maharaj/Giriraj were stopped. They just said what they felt. Is freedom of expression is reserved for some groups only?</comment>

<comment>Rahul Gandhi's moral support is with terrorists and anti-nationals. </comment>

<comment>You mean immoral support</comment>

<comment>Rahul Gandhi, a CHRISTIAN, has only one agenda. He want to weak our country just for his own benefit. Why did he expelled the people who wrote against Nehru/gandhi(ROYAL/VVVVIP) family? Where was freedom of expression?</comment>

<comment>Hang this GADDAR first....this IDIOT is shame to the country</comment>

<comment>Rahul Gandhi supporting anti-nationals is a shame for Indians who are still tolerating him. If Indians don't rise up against such a treachery on the nation India will be doomed. </comment>

<comment>U r right, this IDIOT shud be killed in front of parliament</comment>

<comment>RaGa is unfit to become sarpanch of a grampanchayat and see the irony he is dreaming to become PM of India..</comment>

<comment>Today this bugger has proved that he is a barmaid's son..</comment>

<comment>Why insult barmaids? He is treacherous woman's dumb and treacherous son</comment>

<comment>Fully agree sir</comment>

<comment>How can any sane person support these anti national. We people of india make sure they not given a vote in any election</comment>

<comment>This b@$tard says that Government is bullying JNU for not toeing government line..What sh1t is he talking?So now the fact that Afzal, Yakub and Kasab were terrorists is government line? </comment>

<comment>We hindus wake upNow we know. .these people rauls khagress and leftist and khanjraeala are ready ro distroy our nation.</comment>

<comment>4 Hindu's can unite when they have to take the 5th one to the crematorium</comment>

<comment>Already they have dismembered our country. Cut off its arms. Now they want to get at its heart. Country men the freedom struggle is not yet complete until we throw out the viceroys of the west the Gandhi family and their commie stooges. </comment>

<comment>I think we shoukd not see Pakistani soldiers across the border as our concern but traitors under the garb of politicians and democratic rights fighting us from withinThere is one way, a mass movement across the country where all Indians say that being indian and being proud of our nation and it's interests only count. All other idealogies can go to hell. These protesting students and their parents must know that they are taking a path at their own peril. </comment>

<comment>All the free scholarships etc. to these desh drohi students should be cancelled right away, faculty members supporting them fired and Rahul should Shut up.  But he is hastening the demise of the Congress party so let him blabber. Real Indians need to UNITE.</comment>

<comment>Shame on this moron! His family is trying to sell India in pieces! </comment>

<comment>Rahul is India's no.1 anti-national b@$tard</comment>

<comment>Rahul is a b@$tard.He is cock suckker of ISIS, Commies & Pakis.</comment>

<comment>If Indira Gandhi was around, today she would have put Rahul in prison.</comment>

<comment>I doubt it very much. She was a very corrupt opportunistic person.</comment>

<comment>He should not be released for 30 years, along with Sonia.</comment>

<comment>"I tell you,there are more than billion people in country who believe what you believe in and standing right behind you," What a joker. How did you get 44 seats then?</comment>

<comment>If there is a congress supporter out there - hang your head in shame. If Nehru were alive today, he would have publicly whipped Rahul.Today you have been made to support“Bharat ki Barbadi tak Kashmir ki Aadi tak jung karenge jung karenge; Bharat ke solah tukrade honge Insa Allah Insa Allah; Kitne Afzal maroge har ghar se Afzal niklega; Afzal hi hatya nahi sahenge nahi sahenge, halla bol halla bol, ladkar lenge Azadi, cheen kar lenge Azadi, Azadi Azadi, Pakistan Zindabad, Pakistan Zindabad…”</comment>

<comment>Such forward planning. solah tukade tak Some dream !</comment>

<comment>Two years out of power and congress is sending it's leaders Salman, Mani and others to Pakistan.And then Rahul supports slogans below - you do the math.“Bharat ki Barbadi tak Kashmir ki Aadi tak jung karenge jung karenge; Bharat ke solah tukrade honge Insa Allah Insa Allah; Kitne Afzal maroge har ghar se Afzal niklega; Afzal hi hatya nahi sahenge nahi sahenge, halla bol halla bol, ladkar lenge Azadi, cheen kar lenge Azadi, Azadi Azadi, Pakistan Zindabad, Pakistan Zindabad…”</comment>

<comment>Rahul and every congress supporter now has to answer only one questionWhich of these "dissent" slogans from JNU they are supporting“Bharat ki Barbadi tak Kashmir ki Aadi tak jung karenge jung karenge; Bharat ke solah tukrade honge Insa Allah Insa Allah; Kitne Afzal maroge har ghar se Afzal niklega; Afzal hi hatya nahi sahenge nahi sahenge, halla bol halla bol, ladkar lenge Azadi, cheen kar lenge Azadi, Azadi Azadi, Pakistan Zindabad, Pakistan Zindabad…”</comment>

<comment>rahul gandhi is supporting these traitors????Shame on you congress....</comment>

<comment>Lo aaa gaye rajkumar.. Woh ek kejriwal aur ye pappu... Shaap hai Shaap is desh ko...</comment>

<comment>Shame shame pappu</comment>

<comment>If required one year of useless schooling may be cut for compulsory army service. Guns makes people responsible - or one may be shot! For example MK Gandhi was shot. Modi should abandon the path of Gandhian Socialism of Vajpayee. Gandhiism was selling of his supporters (Hindus) to buy Jinnah's support or Muslims support. Socialism is legal robbery. Why does not Modi denounce Gandhian Socialism. If required blood needs to be shed [Mahabharata]------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is well known that ISI/ ISIS target Brahmins. Suppose Free speech is used to create conditions of genocide by ISI against Brahmins? As India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule, where Individual rights are secondary and frequently murdered like merit is murdered by Reservation policy and property rights by Socialism], for the short term, immediately, Brahmins need protection. Hence Maoists, communists, Kashmiri militants and ISI agents need to be crushed. With free gun laws + Capitalism constitution changes to INDIVIDUAL centric and former Brahmins[present dalits] will not need special protection.Leftists follow the communist politburos which have the aim to establish their single party dictatorship. Socialism has to have ultimately single party dictatorship. As George Orwell puts it:" One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safe guard a revolution, One does a revolution in order to establish a dictatorship". In India since a single party dictatorship is not possible over entire India - they have to take recourse to dictatorships over FRAGMENTS of India - hence support to secessionism.=========================================With free gun laws + capitalism society will not be VULNERABLE and all kinds of free speech can be allowed for INDIVIDUALS[not for Gangs]. AT PRESENT INDIANS ARE NOT CITIZENS BUT ARE GANGSTERS - example Frequent Bandhs halting cities, Reservation policy, Burning of trains</comment>

<comment>Rahul Gandhi is such an unimaginable b@stard</comment>

<comment>30 years of jail life will do him a lot of good.</comment>

<comment>I doubt it very much. His is a hopeless case.</comment>

<comment>Its  a  Shame  that  Rahul  Gandhi  is  supporting  Terrorist  sympathizers  posing  as  students.  The  JNU   President   led  the  students in   shouting  anti-India  slogans  fully  well  knowing  that  the  VC  had  cancelled  permission  to  hold  the  cultural  programme.  Is  Rahul  Gandhi  encouraging  indiscipline  on  our  student  Campus?  Is  this  why  the  Indian  people  subsidize  these  University.  You  are  a  disgrace  Mr  Rahul  Gandhi</comment>

<comment>rahul gandhi should not support those shouting supporting a terroristand shouting anti indian slogans ,that is not the mark of leader of a national party</comment>
