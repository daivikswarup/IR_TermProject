<comment>CM sahib Please for Delhiwalahs stop hating and blaming our nation loving PM. If you will talk good of him he will certainly cooperate with you.Why dont you think this way that if he can talk with Nawaaz then why he cant talk to you?You give him a gali like psychopath and you expect him to cooperate.Are you the PM of this country?You behave as if 67 seats in delhi have made you the PM of this country?Please please start working as we delhiwalas are suffering everyday due to your bad behaviour.</comment>

<comment>Kejriwals never ending Obsession with MODI,  he has stooped so low that even if he loses his cellphone , he blames MODI for that. No CM in the country is behaving as cheap as Kejrwial a biggest 420 in the history of INDIA</comment>

<comment>Modi is arresting AAP ministers for small things like fight with wife and not asking his own corrupt ministers like jaitley against whome their own ministers are blaming for corruption. Is this double face of Modi. How can they blame others while they themselves are corrupt. First clean your own house.</comment>

<comment>I wonder what AAP supporters see in this useless guy. Modi is working 16 hours everyday for our country's progress and this guy is visiting theaters and seeing movies. Wears designer sweaters that is beyond the means of any aam aadmi but wears chappals to see a visiting president. Such a hypocrite, so obvious but still some are blind.</comment>

<comment>Kejribai see political standard of mr. Modi that he never even replied or tweeted against your countless allegations. If he wanted he could have dragged you in the court and stripped you naked in front of the whole country for your abuses. You just change the way you do dirty politics, whole country is watching.</comment>

<comment>Is this the "Team India"  Feku is talking about by not allowing a duly elected Govt., which registered such a comprehensive sweep unparalleled in history without bringing any emotional issues  upfront  and taking up just  the issues of common man and brought them to the forefront as the guiding agenda !!Feku's Govt., is shamelessly trying to create every obstacle by misusing the position of Lt., Governor and leveraging the advantage of absence of clear demarcation of responsibilities shared  between five power centres namely, the Central Govt., State Govt., Lt. Governor, MCD and DDA by not delineating them and muddling the picture making a farce of his slogan "Team India" which has proved to be an absolute non starter like his other slogans !!</comment>

<comment>u shameless ....afzhal gurus chamcha,...</comment>

<comment>Have you elected a c.m. or kaamwali bai?</comment>

<comment>Hey moderator scumwhy pro vulturewaal comment with less up votes is shown as the best comment?</comment>

<comment>Oh even with absolute majority Kejriwal is playing victim....so what's new?</comment>

<comment>Is it any different from what Feku and BJPee are doing blaming Congress for every one of their mishaps !!  He he he !!</comment>

<comment>Yes you are, rather worst than ISIS....</comment>

<comment>AAP ki Nautanki...what else!</comment>

<comment>And BJP is a Dokla Fart..what else</comment>

<comment>Since ak has done no work in delhi, neither he has any intention of doing something good for delhi, so he will keep shouting to remain in media. Someone rightly said that he is worst than a traitor.</comment>

<comment>An enemy is better than a Traitor Mr. Kejriwal</comment>

<comment>why is it that crooks from dmk made merry with 2g while being part of the UPA and went to jail are now bosom buddies wiv the current dispensation ?</comment>

<comment>Can Aravind Kejriwal answer why is it that Sheila Dixit had no issues with Center when she was a CM for 3 terms, of which one was with Vajpayee?? Why is that only Kejriwal has all the problems in the world. Naach na jaane angan tedha??</comment>

<comment>She have no issues..since she only wanted to do corruption..Since BJP was in Bad shape with the factional fights..She won three elections...BJP gave the victories to her in platter</comment>

<comment>There is a mental problem here.</comment>

<comment>Arwind wants people to wish his and be his well wisher while calling names and beating wrong drums. He need to think about the state of his affairs and how to work with people with governance.</comment>

<comment>well u should know whether u are worse than pakistan , or not . anyway , wishes cannot be begged , they are spontaneous , u call the PM psychopath and expect him to wish you , well now u are the psychopath khujli</comment>

<comment>This question must be asked to yourself Mr. Kejriwal and not to the PM.  If must amend your ways if you find an affirmative answer to your question.  Even Pakistan did not call our PM a psychopath.</comment>

<comment>for bankrupt bjp it is vendetta agenda and nothing on ground.Jumlas are flowing in Ganges and promise to clean it getting murkier....BJP is just talking like a broken record and repeating what congress did</comment>

<comment>Why dont u state what Kejriwal has done in 1 year? Odd Even, only when High Court interwened? What else.. List it down here. Be  atrue Kejri fan</comment>

<comment>haha look at your comments bro......U are a true bhakt of Kejriwal.</comment>

<comment>Anarchist AK, for Modi you are not only worse than Pakistan but worser than RSS, because here is where Modi's ego falters and since he can not get even with RSS, Modi is venting his frustration on you, understood, you moron. </comment>

<comment>If a guy thinks aamir Khan has been kicked out of the job, well, he's just a follower of this poor fellow, brainless aaptard </comment>

<comment>Headley is their new hero ! Look how all the VVIPs immediately fell for his soothing and comforting words !The man has been certified as a serial liar. He has cheated everyone who trusted him. He laughs and claps during a court session. He does not give the posterior of a rattus rattus who thinks what of him.He even said Kasab was a martyr.Yet, he's the darling of folks like that glaucoma eyed patra for saving vanzara and his ilk.Yep, ArKe is right : some folks like Pak more than him.And, if Hafeez Saeed, tomorrow says that some 19 yr old girl whom he never knew was a suicide bomber then, his b'day too shall be celebrated.The trouble is, mobs of men who are only capable of mob mentality, can be played like puppets on a string as is right now being done by the US passport holder Headley !</comment>

<comment>Headly is a bjpig !</comment>

<comment>You sir, are a certifiable moron</comment>

<comment>But of less degree than that of ur runt fekuu n bhakat bjpigs like u </comment>

<comment>But ironically he born up from your mothers womb </comment>

<comment>I want to see him become the PM</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal as PM is more scary than Rahul Gandhi as PM lolz</comment>

<comment>Gawd! What a horrible prospect.</comment>

<comment>It will not be so bad, at least for common people of country. Crony capitalists like Ambani, Adani, Jindals, Vedanta, Mallyas will have a tough time though. Also when we can handle a man who got thousands murdered under his direct supervision, man like AK will definitely not hurt the country so much.</comment>

<comment>Acha....then how much capitalisets had tough time in Delhi till now.....If you didnt knew ask kejru</comment>

<comment>Was it your dad who murdered thousands ? Ugly bstrd</comment>

<comment>If my dad had, I would have left him or rather made sure he pays for his deeds. Would not have allowed him to get away. Well, bhakts can not get this.</comment>

<comment>Of syriya?</comment>

<comment>This man should get a chance to run nation or at least a real state like UP.</comment>

<comment>Let him run a statte like UP. He will know what it is reality.</comment>

<comment>First let him run delhi properly</comment>

<comment>why ?</comment>

<comment>This man should be taken to Everest and nudged down from there so that not a single part will left behind intact</comment>

<comment>Am I worse than Pakistan???Simply Yes.</comment>

<comment>exactly my thought</comment>

<comment>He is Pakistani as s that's why he is worst than Pakistan </comment>

<comment>Kejru and his gang killed 2 BJP leaders in 12 hours in Bihar...This Assshole kills BJP leaders and then turns around and says 'whyare they not talking to me?'Kausi Manasiktha se jee raha hai yeh sala?</comment>

<comment>Arre o Budbakwa - Lalua bahut naraaj hai ! Ee to humra credit uu sasure Kejru ko de raha hai !</comment>

<comment>Mass murderer killed 2200 peoples !</comment>

<comment>wish you were in the list too</comment>

<comment>Woh meri umar ka hai. If my dad was like him, I would have been the proudest son in the world.</comment>

<comment>Well AAPHoles, kejru himself admitted he is worse than Pakistan..</comment>

<comment>But ur hizra feku loves nawaj's hairy balled biryani 😄</comment>

<comment>Kujli you are worst than kasab </comment>

<comment>Oh yes. Otherwise he would not have gone out of the way to make life better for Delhites. He would have rather kept the petrol prices higher and let public suffer.</comment>

<comment>U a shit eater of khujliwal ., u r really a pig holes </comment>

<comment>Yes you are worse than even Hafiz Sayeed</comment>

<comment>But feku loves sayeed n his balls !</comment>

<comment>No no khujliwal ka naya papa londu saeed Aur tera dada </comment>

<comment>bhakt ki chir gayee.</comment>

<comment>When modi appeared on the national scene he gave most of us hope of a better future. Unfortunately over the last year we are seeing him act less towards that goal and more towards actively crushing political opponents. This strategy is backfiring badly and the BJp will continue to lose the mandate it once had. This will also revive the fortunes of parasites like mulloo lulloo aku mayu jayu etc, who are the worst products of our country and destroy the Federal structure. </comment>

<comment>He is working day to night but this mosquito khujliwal has lost his sleep even </comment>

<comment>So, BJP should support people like Yakub, Afzal, Kasab and Ishrat..BJP should also support people who kill and Rape Hindus..Thank god BJP is not like that...Regarding Lallu - Biharis voted him, despite him being a criminal.And Khujili hugged Lallu.And here you are preaching...All the intolerance nonsense is nothing but anti-hindu agenda of Congress and AAP.We Hindus know who is for us and who is Nautanki.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, of course ! It's just that we seldom cast our votes, because picnic on voting day appeals to us more !</comment>

<comment>BJP should instead trust Headley and Haafiz Sayeed. After all, these people are good for India. Right?</comment>

<comment>Tu itna bada gndu kyu h</comment>

<comment>BC </comment>

<comment>People of India has to realise that there is an unholy nexus existing between Corrupt political parties, Corrupt Business groups, Corrupt Bureaucrats, Paid Media groups and Corrupt elements in Judiciary in this country. Each member ofthis corruption mafia takes the help of other members to pin down people who question their corruption. If one fails then they employ another and together they have so far always succeeded in silencing the voice of the common peopleagainst corruption.These powerful and corrupt vested interest groups feel threatened by the presence of Aam Aadmi Party which has been constantly questioning their large scale corruption .Hence corrupt corporate groups and political parties are working 24x7 to malign AAP by all means. For this they misrepresent facts, misinterpret the comments made by AAP leaders, Post derogatory paid news against AAP and have also deployed thousands of paid trolls to post negative comments all over the internet against AAP. Indians should be careful and not get carried away by this malicious campaign by paid media and paid trolls</comment>

<comment>Ritik excellent observation. The day voter of india becomes aware about what is actually happening around them will be the turning point for this nation.</comment>

<comment>Yeah..This Moron Kejru abuses PM opelny and then turns around and says PMis not co-operating with him!!Kaunsi Manasiktha Se jee rahe ho thum log?</comment>

<comment>The moron PM openly got thousands butchered and can not even handle open criticism? Wah re Bhakt.</comment>

<comment>tera papa bhi tha kya ? bh0sdike</comment>

<comment>Who has doubt about what AK asked ?</comment>

<comment>Pakistan</comment>

<comment>Don't worry it's the corrupt media which is giving this joker undue coverage... Much better CM's are sidelined for this colossal joker.</comment>

<comment>Typical paigambar strategy..spew venom against Modi and a toady media prostates itself to carry the word of the master...</comment>

<comment>This tharki thinks that it's PM's job to send two guards if someone's wife feels unsafe in India...he's a shame on us IITians...destroyer of middle class hopes of clean politics</comment>

<comment>answer yourself. you inflict unprecedented shame with 67/3 and they hug him with return gift of Pathankot in return to the safa as birthday gift he presented. then who is worse?</comment>

<comment>Handful of bhjpa and RSS people think that india belong to them and they can do whatever they want. They ask every other person to leave the country.</comment>

<comment>Handful of anti nationals think they can  insult anything and everyone at will and peach it's tolerance.... But when I practice the tolerance against them then it's intolerance..... Why this hypocrisy? </comment>

<comment>Arvind Kerjriwal, popularly known as or alias Kuljiwala Mullabhai, is a king of gutter and it was a political accident he came to occupy the seat of power.Nawaz Sherif perceived to be more a patriot of his own country unlike your image as a traitor of your country.You cannot question Modi for making accusations against, but i ask you to juggle your memory and recollect your own description of Modi as a psycopath and coward. what respect you have for the office of PM?Aamir Khan said his wife wanted to leave India and he also felt so.  Why should he need two guards?  He has the choice to leave the country and go to one which his wife recommends.  No one can stop him.  Perhaps you too can join him.All your actions and notifications are in clear violation of the constitution. They need nothing more than strong condemnation.</comment>

<comment>'Hindu tolerance' as you choose to describe it is what makes us different from Pakistan. This is what makes the fact that despite coming from a common past we unlike Pakistanis did not become terrorists this is because our leaders post independence like Patel, Nehru, Ambedkar etc took us on a different path. Lose that and we will be no different and start creating our own Hafeez Saeeds and other such creatures. Vicious sub humans like Adityanath, Sangeet Som, Owaisi Thackerays etc are trying to make us like them, and must be isolated. Views like yours are not what our country needs. </comment>

<comment>Sorry Rms - we have had enough peacedoves amongst us who only cared for their own peaceful & progress existence.  This is what has been done to Hindus.  People like your own leader, euphemestically called Pandit, had and succeded always in throttling the aspirations of Hindus since independence and thrown to gutters.If you are aware of what happened to Kashimiri Hindus and those Hindus where they lived in minority in independent India ,you will know what the damage has been done to India and the Hindus.violence, though not has been our preferred choice, violence to eliminate violence is not forbidden for us.  Otherwise, there would have been no need for Ram or Krisna to incarnate.  To protect y ou have two ways - either take on to your heels and run faster than your enemy or confront him with equal force.  We have been running and running and now tired to run.  It's time to stop running and start giving back.</comment>

<comment>Hindu tolerance is not what you want..If you turn a blind eye to evil, you are not a Hindu.when evil happens, it is every Hindu's duty to fight it.Look at Hindus history, we are kind and forgiving butYou want Hindus to be cowards and submit to abuses.</comment>

<comment>Hindu tolerance? Explain.....On the Other hand you are totally confused likeNehru and his coteries.... Who experimented with Indian society with their demented thoughts...Tolerance wasn't coined and described by socialist but imbibed in our culture for millenniums.Technically speaking second half of your comment reeks of intolerance by your own logic.</comment>

<comment>Yes you are  mofo, yes you are. You are worse than a filthy street rat...</comment>

<comment>There you go. Drama queen. I was counting the days. Not even 4 days he cant keep quiet and rule the state. Again started his verbal diarrhea.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately for creatures like you AK is doing more for Delhi than Modi is doing for the country. I hope that they get a chance in Punjab, and I hope even more that they don't screw up. </comment>

<comment>Oh God! How much he Krazywala speaks???? There is no odd-even formula for his bloody mouth???????? Always speaks as if he is God and all others are bad in this world......</comment>

<comment>Kejru has one day oral diarrhea and next day vomitting. So thats his Odd even formula.</comment>

<comment>A rat is always worse than a wolf across the border</comment>

<comment>Traitor self confessed it....</comment>

<comment>Central govt should not have taken away ACB from state...thats really goondagardi..even after taking it away just 15FIR in 8 months??...while ss yadav filed 150 FIR in just 1 month!!!...</comment>

<comment>Mr Bhushan wanted a debate with Kejri... Why run away then....</comment>

<comment>Yes, you are worse than Pakistan. Pakistan never threatened to disrupt the RD celebrations but you did.</comment>

<comment>KHAMOSH  !!….. I am Zahir Ud-din Muhammed Babur – a.k.a Emperor Babur, Master of Short and Dark Hindu Slaves….. I am disappointed that you Hindu slaves have gone back to your infighting again… Now I will unite all lands of India, Pakistan and Afghanistan again under one rule, under one God Allah and under one flag of Islamic Caliphate. Everybody will behave and obey…. Just like in the old times….. Smriti Irani will wear a Burkha during the day and dance at gazal parties at night and serve as a “saki”. Ugly Nitin Gadkari will not  F A R T but hand out land allotments to W H O R E Hema Malini a.k.a. Aisha Bi R. Chakravarty and Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel’s daughter through Waqf Board… not under the table… Delhi will be called “Baburabad”.  \</comment>

<comment>I am drawing a picture of your prophet can't get the nose right.. Care to help?</comment>

<comment>Much better than crazy lipstick wearing blue Hindu Gods... take the example of Lord Shiva. You put him in the cold Himalayas without a shirt that froze his B A L L S and now you put warm mild on his lingam here. Goddess Parvati is totally frustrated with him since he beheaded her son Ganesha and does not return home for years. She cannot take him anywhere with his crazy snakes around the neck. So he is now eloping with Mohammed in heaven when Goddess Saraswati is giving him a BJ on the side.</comment>

<comment>Man you sure are funny for a Mohammedan.. By the way does your prophet have a a hole?</comment>

<comment>LOL !!! Emperor does not have hole or pole!</comment>

<comment>He had circumcised nose;) !!!</comment>

<comment>Yes kejriwal u r not loving boy, bkos day and night u have one agenda just curse Modi the Prime Minister of India.. Being a mayor of city and giving subsidy on everything to get vote, itself shows u r harming india and its people. U made fool of everyone, judiciary, big companys, executives and so on before election and now just Modi. So I know what is wrong or right. In straight words I just love and admire Mr. Narender Modi, Prime Minister of India. want next three terms for Mr Modi as Prime Minister.For kejriwal, he can abuse Mr. Modi or our country, it doesn't make any difference to us.</comment>

<comment>Cooperative federalism is a sham. Bewakoof bana rahein hai saari duniya ko (They are fooling everybody). But the statement is valid for Mr Kejriwal too. Cooperative federalism is a two way traffic. Mr Kejriwal himself is always combative.</comment>

<comment>An enemy of country within its borders is far more worse than  the one across it.. </comment>

<comment>A man (?) Who  is a coward and a psychopath calls the PM of the country   as coward and a psychopath and THEN  has the disgusting GALL to play victim ??? This piece of crap vulturewaal is BEYOND CONTEMPT !!Unfortunate part is (if India today poll on 1 year of vulturewaal govt is anything to by) MORONS of Delhi haven't learnt ANY lessons ..They are least bothered that this man supports khalistani secessionists,  that he plays politics on dead bodies of students , tries worst form of minority appeasement ..shields corrupt officers,  and does nautanki instead of governing. .its rightly said in democracy people get the govt they deserve</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal has all the Characteristics of Pakistan, lying, playing victime, cheating, betraying, back-stabbing, falseness, blabbering, supporting the fall of India etc..etc...</comment>

<comment>But with pakis at least you know they are declared enemy of state</comment>

<comment>yes, enemy inside the country is more dangerous.</comment>

<comment>Yes u are Worse than Pakistan. PERIOD.</comment>

<comment>Kejriwalji, please stand in front of the mirror and ask this question. You will get your answer. Track your history from cheating attempt on government loan to Anna Hazare episodes and you will get your answers. Think about your attempt to do politics over funeral pyres, you will get the answer. Above all, ask your family what they think of you and whether they are able to hold their head without shame, you will get the answer. You are a national shame!</comment>

<comment>Yes Mr. Kejriwal you are worse than Pakistan. Because Pakistan is enemy, while you are traitor.</comment>

<comment>Mohammed and Aisha lol</comment>

<comment>And i have already scr*wed your 72 lol</comment>

<comment>And i have already screwed your 72 lol</comment>

<comment>NO NEED TO DIE AND GO TO HEAVEN FOR 72 VIRGINS..................You Hindus do not have to die and go to heaven to get 72 virgins. You can get them right here in New Delhi city buses or police station. It is allowed if you are connected or corrupt, camina or cruel like bhagoda Narendra Modi. You can burn them alive in SATI, you can hang them on trees in UP, you can rape mothers with infants in police station, you can do bride burning, do honor killing on orders of Hindu khaap punchayat, you can hit a woman with a brick if she refuses to give you a bribe, you can get out from back doors of justice like Salman Khan or Sanjay Dutt, you can abandon your wife and deny you were married like napunsak Modi... There are many more choices as a Hindu than you were Muslim. Understand the power of Hindu stupidity.</comment>

<comment>Breaking news..BHEL @ NSE  is cheaper than BHEL @ Bombay shiv sagar 😂</comment>

<comment>See and recheck, Modi never told that he will give everyone 15 lakh, secondly the day Modi came to power people with black money already shifted their money. Just wait and write against modi, its nothing wrong but not bad words.</comment>

<comment>FORGET CONTROVERSY OVER MASTERS DEGREE, PM MODI TO GET PHD DEGREE FROM BHU-----------------Feku Narendra Modi is accused of not disclosing his educational qualifications with his office declining to reply to repeated RTI requests. However, thanks to Banaras Hindu University (BHU), the prime minister can soon be proudly flaunting his doctorate degree. The BHU has proposed to felicitate Modi with a degree of Doctor of Law during its convocation ceremony later this month. No wonder no Indian university is ranked in the top 200 (forget the top 50) in the entire world. And no wonder why Modi appoints the uneducated and a lying liar Smriti Irani as the nation’s uneducated education minister. All fake degree Indians are welcome in BJP and become ministers like Vinod Tawde, Ram Shanker Katheria, Babanrao Lonikar and MLA Sangeet Om. India will never be rescpted outside with these corrupt, unqualified criminals who keep undermining the respect and dignity of India, . These criminals belong in jail.</comment>

<comment>Feku and his Bhakths are obsessed and even afraid of Kejriwal governing a quarter State that they reserve all vicious venom against him and his party even ignoring their principal enemy, the Congress.  These Morons do not realize that they are making AAP and Kejriwal a larger than life  figure with such undeserving concentration and spewing hatred !!</comment>

<comment>I just want to know what happened after the raid on Kejriwal's Principal Secy., when the caged parrot named CBI recovered whisky bottles.  This case is in what stage ??  Has an FIR been filed and the charge sheet prepared ?  If not, this is a raid maliciously conducted with pure vengeance by Feku and his marauding gang !!</comment>

<comment>A very frank answer is YES. Pakistan is a known enemy, you are an enemy in our midst - which is more dangerous. One is surprised that you graduated out of IIT - it should have been JNU.</comment>

<comment>hahahahaha...good one...</comment>

<comment>You talk of cooperative federalism, Mr. Kejriwal? Even after using such scurrilous and opprobious language against the elected Prime Minister of the country you went scott free, it was cooperative federalism only.Whatever the government has done, it is well within constitutional bounds. Delhi is a union territory and not a state. In a union territory all the power rest with the President to be exercised by the council if ministers. Having said that, it us equally true that in a traditional union territory there is no state legislature. Vesting power in centre in existence of State Legislative Assembly is a clear violation of people's will.Thus, Delhi should be granted statehood as promised by the BJP government in its manifesto. It will solve all the problem.</comment>

<comment>Granting full statehood to Delhi will be dangerous. With a madcap like AK, he can stall the whole country by holding ruling party leaders on false and frivolous charges. He can even cause a coup. All parties are at fault for making this promise.</comment>

<comment>I agree. But don't you think vesting power with the centre with an existant legislative assembly makes a mockery of will of the people. It completely obfuscates the purpose of electing representative in Delhi. </comment>

<comment>In the recent past, the CM of a state in western India abused the PM of our country. What was that?</comment>

<comment>Criticism is an inherent part of democracy. But, criticism should be done with appropriate words, specially when it is the Prime Minister, who represents the will of the people of this country. Vitriolic and scurrilous language should always be avoided. There should be healthy debate and not ad hominem attacks.This applies to every leader and citizen of this country, whichever state or part of the country he belongs to.</comment>

<comment>Agree with you but mauni baba, shikhandi,robot,bootlicker, dhritrashtra were used by him and his campaign machinery. Not to mention morphed and photoshopped images along with lots of abuses circulated by BJP IT cell. The genie is out of the bottle now. People love such language, that's why leaders use it. Speaks more of our intellect and thought process</comment>

<comment>Don't give logical answers to  AAP zombies and/or haters from minorities</comment>

<comment>Parliament to commence...Opposition led by RAGA garnering opportunities to stall the parliament..</comment>

<comment>In many ways, Kejriwal is a much better CM than most others non-BJP CMs like Akhilesh, Mayawati, Mulayam, Mamta etc.Yet his understanding of so called "communalism" is equally faulty. I cant believe that an educated person like him is still defending Amir Khan, the Paki agent.</comment>

<comment>My housemaid didn't show up, is this what we voted you for Modi? </comment>

<comment>Of course Kejru, you are far worse than Pakistan ! But while we will have to suffer Pakistan for all times to come, there is every chance that after 4 years you will be in some dust-bin !</comment>

<comment>"Cooperative" needs at least two sides -- you're not filling your side of it at all AK!</comment>

<comment>Please don't put words into his mouth. The language you used against the PM and now you talk of federalism.</comment>

<comment>THE BIG ISSUE IS MODI'S POOR CHARACTER------(1) Modi lying to Indian people(2) Modi lying under oath on legal papers for 15 years(3) Modi abandoning his wife and family responsibilities(4) Modi not providing for his wife who lives in squalor(5) Modi snooping on other women in Gujarat using Government machinery(6) Poor Jasodaben doing fast and Vrata for Modi where this scum bag is salivating for power</comment>

<comment>NATION THAT THINKS JASODABEN’S INJUSTICE DOES NOT MATTER-----------Modi married Jasodaben at the age of 18 and left her without providing for her, without ever caring about her during sicknesses and hardships, without divorce and lied about marriage in public for 47 years. YET, people think there was nothing wrong with it and it was personal matter. In the Hindu cultures the scdriptures tell us to be a man and stand up for our responsibilities even though you do not want it. He did not want to be married BUT the fact was that he was married at an adult age. Modi chose to run away and lie about it. This is the character of people we elect and glorify them. No wonder India is ranked at the bottom in how we treat our women…. SATI, female infanticides, rapes in streets, rapes in police stations, murder and hanging them on trees and overall substandard treatment, to women are DIRECT results of how we think and mistreat women. We are all responsible for how Modi mistreated Jasodaben.</comment>

<comment>THE TRUTH IS THE TRUTH, YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CANNOT HIDE FROM IT---------------------The truth is ugly and it is often horrific. The truth about criminal and liar Modi will not change just because you do not like it. Often the truth is inconvenient and it hurts but you cannot shoot the messenger because you don't like it. The truth must and will shine no matter what the authorities, cronies, criminals and chumachas think. ..... BUT THE TRUTH WILL PREVAIL AND THE TRUTH WILL SHINE....... The truth has no fear of the dynasties, political thugs, the Gandhi Family and their cronies or Bhagoda Modi, Amit Shah and their cronies. Poor Nibhaya was brutally assaulted from the evening hours into the late night in a moving bus in the capital of the nation that prides in the 8,000 old superior cultural heritage. No matter how much we do not like the truth, we have to face it, admit our failings and do something about it. The truth will expose you no matter how hard you will try and throw criminals and their supports in jail to rot. KNOW THE POWER OF THE TRUTH.</comment>

It will matter to millions of Indian people who obey the law and not lie about marriage on election affidavits but it will not matter to chumachas like you and Napunsal Modi (NaMo) who break the laws of the nation and are real desh drohis of India.</comment>
