<comment>The country would have been better off with Nitish Kumar as the leader instead of this lying machine called Napunsak Modi</comment>

<comment>NITISH KUMAR WHO IS A LOVING FAMILY MAN AND HAS NOT ABANDONED HI WIFE LIKE Feku NAPUNSAK MODI.... WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE POPULAR LEADER OF nda</comment>

<comment>Yes, it is true that people from world over come to see the Taj Mahal and not the Ram Mandir but the Moghul Emperor Shah Jahan stole the architecture from a Shiva Temple and built the Taj Mahal by whipping Hindu slaves. The Moghuls stole ideas from the Hindus all the time. Like the Qutub Minar was based on Jain architecture and built by whipping Hindu slaves again. Even America and CIA stole ideas from the Hindus. For example, America stole the nuclear bomb technology from Lord Ram who had invented Agni Astra already 6,000 years ago. But it was not built by Hindu slaves because Hindus and their mangoes were not allowed to enter America.  The Americans preferred smarter and cleaner scientists from Israel. India is going to be a super power soon and the only difference between America and India today is that America has toilets for its people while we, the proud Hindu followers of Lord Ram defecate in public just like Lord Ram and Maa Sita did in their good old days. As far as we know, there is no record of Shabri, Vali, Sugreev or brother Bharat holding the potty basket for them every morning.</comment>

<comment>WHY INDIANS DEFECATE IN THE OPEN?..................Many foreigners have aksed me why Indians defecate in public? There are many theories going on but I know what the truth is. It started thousands of years ago when brother Ram was the Earth. During his exile, he lived in jungles, in mountains, by the river… you name it. There were no toilets there but he had one thing going….. DEVOTEES ! They were ready to do anything for him. Devotees like Shabri, Vali, Sugreev and even Hanuman used hold a pot*ty bucket for brother Ram, Sita Maiyya and Laxman. Lo and behold…. King Ravan of Sri Lanka got the wind of it and he was furious. He loved Sita and could not swallow Maa Sita’s miserable living. He thought Ram failed her. King Ravan was angry and he decided to bring her in Ashokban, a beautiful garden wth all (organic) fruits, full with comforts, protected by his soldiers and an in-house covered toilet. Sri Lanka was advanced. Ma Sita did not want to leave but the rest is just mythology mumbo jumbo… The Hindu devotees followed whatever Ram did blindly and are still doing it like abusing wives.</comment>

<comment>Shame! 'Toilet before Temple'!</comment>

<comment>Nitish Babu, Badhiyan hai ! You make a law in 2006 and abolish it in 2016 ! In the intervening 10 years, you did not consider it necessary to act on your own law and get the toilets built ? But no issues, Biharis have elected you again - so Mast Raho !</comment>

<comment>A certain kumar now knows what death wish means...</comment>

<comment>Aaloo's goons are used to doing it in the open...so, the move is obvious...JUNGLE RAJ fear not, here we come...</comment>

<comment>Indeed it is a great shame for a country to be talking about the loo when it should be a normal  necessity for all its citizens.</comment>

<comment>Khuli hawa me ...... karne ka maza hi kuch alag hai !Laloo Rumours now Bihar will use pee for everything to save water,from cooking to bathing. Already rivers are polluted so better use this "organic Detol" instead.</comment>
