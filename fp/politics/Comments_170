<comment>Owaisi is funded by the BJP/RSS gang !!</comment>

<comment>His younger brother should be sent to jail for 10 years for making insulting remarks towards Hindu Gods</comment>

<comment>what about your leaders like prachi,adityanath,togadia,bhawat?</comment>

<comment>It will be good if he "takes care" of Mulayam</comment>

<comment>I dont see why this jihadi is a problem. He will split the Mullah vote. His rise will be the end of the "secular" parties.</comment>

<comment>Civil War in making! For good or bad, I don't know!</comment>

<comment>During Nizam rule in Hyderabad, AIMIM (or formerly MIM) was a small cultural department of a larger organisation called Razakars. The Razakars was Nizam's Islamic militia who were infamous for terrorising hindus in Hyderabad. During partition Nizam pledged allegiance to Pakistan and Razakars passionately defended their Nizam and fought the Indian Army during Hyderabad's annexation. Ofcourse, Nizam and his Razakars lost, Sardar Patel wanted to punish the captured Nizam for war crimes, but the complacent duo Gandhi-Nehru "forgave". After all the anti-nationalism shown by Nizam and his army of Razakars, they were allowed to live happily in India. Ofcourse now Nizam is dead, but Razakars thrive as AIMIM.</comment>

<comment>As a reaction, Indian army killed 25,000 muslims....google and see the police action.....whoever want o leave India left at that time....MIM stayed and chosen India and will remain here to defend and die for this country.....</comment>

<comment>25000 muslims who opposed the Union Of India, just like you seem to do. Army's duty is to kill anti-nationals like you. The audacity with which you muzzies live in this hindu nation, will one day bring upon you the wrath you deserve. Remember Gandhi-Nehru are dead too!</comment>

<comment>and hindus like u are deserving the wrath in pakistan...you jerk..</comment>

<comment>you ain't very smart, are you? Thats alright, but first stay away from Indian forums you obsessive lunatic pakistani!</comment>

<comment>His elevation is result of one and half year of RSS govt...</comment>

<comment>Azam+Maya=Owaisi! No! Weird mathematics.</comment>

<comment>Since this feku came in power RSS and feku won't stop before destroying this country</comment>

<comment>Welcome Tiger as name suggest.....Muslims need representation in assemblies and parliament to stop right wing terror....Muslims don't fear/shy supporting Owaisi's....if Hindus can support to a mass murde*** why not a honest gentlemen?</comment>

<comment>assaddin owaisi also may bring some hope for some section of muslims in hindi belt who don't find representation in yadav and "bhumihaar/qureishi musalmaan"....led SP..RJD...JD(lik azam khan)e it is neither a positive nor negative development...but may aact as a sub ordinate of BJP in UP.....</comment>

<comment>dangerous trend is emerging , going for another partition .Horrible to think . all communal parties should be banned</comment>

<comment>RSS has started it.....they never fought for freedom but this is what expected from them....division..</comment>

<comment>was RSS responsible for partition no. 1 .... RSS or not ...partition is inevitable...it was just waiting for person like Owaisi to come on stage ...</comment>

<comment>This guy is thinking spltting india and making another pak.. dream on..</comment>

<comment>He never says so, its RSS's plan...</comment>

<comment>W T F are you talking? Can  you come again?</comment>

<comment>Its RSS who wants  a complete hindu nation, which will lead to another partition...now u understood?</comment>

<comment>His power is overestimated. The Dalits were with mayawati and now they seem to have hopped on BJP's new coalition - upper caste, Dalit and non-Yadav OBCs. There is not a chance Muslims in UP will leave MSY for owaisi the same way he was a nonexistent alternative to Lalu and Nitish in Bihar. Keep in mind even in Maharashtra which is being used as an example of his success, he got less than 1% of the vote and won in a couple of Muslim-dominated constituencies in a huge state. Nothing to revel over - he is overhyped </comment>

<comment>Aimim is going no where by just giving some token seats to dalits.</comment>

<comment>He is one of the few best and smart politicians that India has ever produced, whatever he speaks he speaks with facts and statistics which I bet no one can challenge this, also he is the one of the few politicians who is highly educated that makes him the suitable leader of Indians and Muslims, it just that some Bhakts do not want to educated leader in society and they still want some chaiwala to lead the nation instead, so they cry like a baby, I guess that's there job and for that they are getting paid</comment>

<comment>And that's exactly why NiKu party & allies are going to lose deposits from more than 80% of contesting locations.  Come November 8th.</comment>

<comment>Owaisi should form coalition with mayawati and then no one can stop them from winning the polls.</comment>

<comment>Dalits have dropped Mayawati for the BJP umbrella and Muslims are not going to leave MSY. No one can say for future elections but in 2017 at least mayawati and owaisi are not in the picture anymore</comment>

<comment>That no one can predict right now. It's too early. Anything can happen. </comment>

<comment>Disagree. Unless Owaisi surprises in Bihar which seems highly unlikely Muslims will never see him as an alternative when MSY is there. And the upper castes fell out of behenji'a coalition already and a heavy number of Dalits are flocking away from her because no caste block wants be with the loser, and right now she looks like a loser. After losing a few years back she has virtually gone into isolation. </comment>

<comment>AIMIM's winning formula Dalits and Muslims. Maywatiji, if they ever come to power in UP, what will happen to your statues ? Islam does not tolerate human statues of any kind.</comment>

<comment>As there are no statues in Hyderabad.</comment>

<comment>Search tankbund and see all status....</comment>

<comment>kya baat  he thode din kya election me busy ho gya pure desh me rada suru kar dia now "Prem is back"....:P..:))</comment>

<comment>Actually Owaisi is good. He and his kind is quickening the final solution. Necessary for India's progress.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Well said.</comment>

<comment>He ran away from Bihar sensing that even is co-religionists are not buying his nonsense. He will be eaten alive by Mayawati if he as mush as sees in the direction of a dalit in UP.</comment>

<comment>Like him or not . But his is one of the fastest rising political parties in India. U r just jealous and insecure... Admit it..... :-)</comment>

<comment>But in UP he is nobody just like Bihar.</comment>

<comment>In maharashtra and telangana lot of dalits have started voting for him. Check Aurangabad municipal elections 5 dalit candidates of AIMIM won.</comment>

<comment>I was talking about UP and Mayawati, not Telangana or Mharashtra. Mayawati is hardly relevant in these two states while UP is her fort.</comment>

<comment>Look BJP in parliament, not even a single muslim....wake up muslims....RSS/BJP made you irrelevant</comment>

<comment>Yes. True. He is highly educated. And he is rising fast. I am not a fan of AIMIM. But 1 thing is for sure... All the people who r speaking against him, are just jealous.... </comment>

<comment>Stop dividing country in name of religion n caste... Bloody lunatics</comment>

<comment>How are Dalits doing in the Muls!m-raj of Pak/Bangla???</comment>

<comment>Excellent ... no lych like in dadri, no riots like muzaffernager, godhara, and mumbai</comment>

<comment>Donâ€™t they have the great doctors that get rid of the head to cure headache. How would you like that treatment in India!</comment>

<comment>India certainly need it, particularly in Delhi where they are raping toddlers and 4 yrs kids...good for our women..what say?</comment>

<comment>YEAH, BECAUSE ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. There is no dalit left in thses countries to torture or lynch.</comment>

<comment>Cow is a part of our religious psyche as "Mata" (mother). Slaughtering it is absolutely unacceptable. In fact milking of cow by non-Hindus (Muslims, Christians) cannot be allowed nor they should be permitted to drink milk of Hindus Mata. This is an article of faith and has to be implemented by the government of the day. Our religious leaders like Shakshi Maharaj, Yogi Adityanath & Togadia should understand this point and have this implemented. As regards the issue of Gow Mutr  I have reservations. We have to review and reconsider because even urine of mother is not something to drunk.</comment>

<comment>Rats (ganesha BMW), monkeys (hunuman brothers), snakes (vishnu's muffler), and bulls (vishnu's trailer) too are sacred to hindus too. So ban killing of these animals too like the hindutuva terrorists are overacting for cow issue to consume its urine/dung. hidnutuva morons can never get brain!!!!as a bhakt, you should drink your cow mata's urine and dung as well.</comment>

<comment>And you do the same with pigs. Eat their sh**t and drink the watery substance they discharge.</comment>

<comment>I think what Owaisi is doing is best for our Nation...he is laying open the faultlines which exist in our Society and wants to have an open discussion on those....Discussion is good....lynching is bad...</comment>

<comment>Finally, someone on this post with an open mind.... :-)Good to c u, sir</comment>

<comment>Owaisi is strengthening the weak's and stitching them into the nation's fabric, which unfortunately they are apart in today's India even after 65+ years</comment>

<comment>This moron will some seats in Muslim-dominated pockets.Other than that,all he does is spreading communal hatred.</comment>

<comment>Many Hindus voting for him and many hindu corpora-tor won from MIM.</comment>

<comment>Hahahahaha.Wait for it.Hahahahahaha.Sorry,you were saying...........No,dont say anything.HahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaI am from Hyd by the way.</comment>

<comment>No Mr. Barbaric opinion. Please do ur homework. Not just Muslims, he has found support from other people too...    Only Muslim's support can't give a political party the type of success Owaisi is enjoying.... </comment>

<comment>He is not enjoying jack sht.I am from Hyd and I know what his party does and where it wins.Even in Maha,he won from Muslim-dominated seats where SS-BJP fought independently.Take your whitewashing attempts somewhere else.</comment>

<comment>what is your hindutuva filthy moths of sakshi, yogi, and leader are doing? are they showering flowers? chaddi A$$O!</comment>

<comment>Aa gaya MIM ka moron.Did I say I support them you brainless chicken?</comment>

<comment>Tamils have own party, marathi, punjabi, yadavs, reddys, kammas, bengali, kannada caste - every one has party- should be no problem for having dalit muslim unity party- jai mayawati, jai owaisi- no political representation - no share in democracy-dalit muslims have same socio economic educations parameters - constitution supreme in democracy</comment>

<comment>Nice name - DUMP party - dalit unity muslim party...What to dump?  And where?</comment>

<comment>owaisi sahib is true representative of our community . i love mim</comment>

<comment>Ominous development. The idea that muslims can be represented only by other muslims was at the root of the two nation theory that divided the country. We are seeing something similar happening once more. The notion that muslims need a separate political organisation of their own is fraught with great danger. Pakistan became a reality within forty years of formation of the Muslim League. Are we headed for another partition ?</comment>

<comment>You are right. Pakistan creation started with a political party called Muslim league. Now with Owaisi history is repeating itself.</comment>

<comment>Yes Mr.  Shiv. U r right. And the type of intolerant atmosphere that has been created in this country in recent times, will only accelerate the division process... Sad, but true... </comment>

<comment>PRACTICING TAQIYA AGAIN!! INTOLERANCE IS SOMETHING ONE SEES IN PAKISTAN (HATRED AGAINST PEOPLE OF BALUCHISTAN, WAZIRISTAN, POK BY PUNJABI DIMINATED PAKISTANI MILITARY AND MILITANTS). YOU CAN SEE THE SAME AGAINST SINDHI SPEAKING PEOPLE BY URDU SPEAKING MUHAJIRS. MINORITIES LIKE SHIAS AND AHMEDIAS TOO ARE FACING THE BRUNT OF HATRED. DID YOU SEE A "DRONE" LATELY, YOUR NATIONAL BIRD?????</comment>

<comment>Recent times? You mean the partition in 1947 ? Or Aurangzeb ? Or the 7th century arrival of  a cult that considers everyone who doesnt believe in it to be infidels who should be killed?</comment>

<comment>Military rule is impose in kashmir . muslim don't have SC & ST Status but a hindu from pakistan and bangladesh can get SC & ST Status if they become indian citizen  . Anti beef law in each and every province of india . plus hindu celebrate 2 festival durga and ganesh puja in which they take money from muslims in the form of  ''chanda'' .  these thing are not in pakistan . that why pakistan is created</comment>

<comment>Military is present in Kashmir not because it is a muslim majority state but because of insurgency there. Military was present in Nagaland and Mizoram too when there was threat of insurgency in those states, and these are not muslim states. We find a large presence of Pakistan army in Balochistan to prevent insurgency and in Ceylon we had a large presence on the Jaffna peninsula to tackle insurgency. You will appreciate that this is not a Hindu Muslim matter. It is true that muslims are at a disadvantage to the extent that they do not have SC /ST benefits; but in this respect they are no worse than millions of general category Hindus who do not enjoy any reservation benefits. The most fair solution would be a complete abolition of all reservations but again, to view this as a Hindiu Muslim issue is not correct. It is not clear why prohibition on beef is viewed as anti muslim- it applies to all communties including beef eating Hindus, christians, sikhs etc.  As for extortion by goons at the time of the festivals, this is utterly wrong and there is no justification for it but I would like to point out that both Hindus and Muslims are equally impacted by it. Many Hindu shopkeepers are forced to make a contribution even when they do not want to.  I am sure there are genuine grievances that muslims have , but let us not construct an excessively negative narrative of victimhood - that does not serve the interests of anybody.</comment>

<comment>Dumbfock, don't like it in India get the fock off to Porkistan.</comment>

<comment>u go to nepal</comment>

<comment>IRAN, SYRIA AND IRAQ HAS DECLARED HOLY WAR ON UAE, SAUDI ARABIA AND TURKEY. RUSSIA IS HELPING THEM IN THIS HOLY WAR. CAN YOU DIG THAT :)</comment>

<comment>Nepal? Lol...it's funny Muslims telling hindus to go to Nepal. Hey moron, this is India, a country as old as humans started learning how to wear clothes. It is 5,000 year old civilization older than your pedophilic cult and better than it. Madrassa graduates who don't like to sing Vande mataram are telling Hindus to go to Nepal lol? There was a separate country created for you in 1947, you should get the fock over there, this is not your country.</comment>

<comment>this is land of dravidians and not hindus ...people cant be termed based on religion ...u bafoons u dont know history ..before some years there was nothing called as hindu ..even the vishnu worshipers were against the worshipers of shiv ... dalits were nt even considered hindus ...  dont be a fool just by changing a religion does not loose the rights from a country .. first go and learn the history properly and come ...dont be blind ... sorry for saying u to go to nepal i said because u said to go pakistan... we are dravidians and we have the top most rights in this contry than the aryans like u</comment>
