<comment>Khattar wants to give reservations to Jats by protecting OBC reservations at the expense of general  merit. BJP is anti-National.------------------------------------------------------------------What if the state is captured by a mob? India is a Ocholocracy [mob rule] as Individual rights( like merit) is murdered, by definition, as by reservation policy and Individual right of property rights are murdered by Socialism. Will you call Jats who destroyed an entire state as anti-National? Will you call kapus anti-National as they burnt a train. Pro-Reservation agitation is action as compared to just hot air of sloganeering [logically punishment should also be hot air]. VP Singh has made constitution anti-national and Modi I suspect will bring private sector reservations to become another VP Singh----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------No Support to Khalid. Kanhaiya Kumar is different as he is not a member of communist Democratic Students Union which is for the murder of Individual rights and is for collectivism. Communists support reservation policy, which is murder of Individual right of merit and also are for demolishing property rights another important Individual right.Kanhaiya Kumar as PM!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------However Let us examine Sedition laws------------------------------------1)Law of Vikamaditya: A prostitute hears a Brahmin who says to his friend that she had appeared in the Brahmins man's dreams and she was wonderful. The Prostitute drags the Brahmin to Vikramaditya for her fees. Vikramaditya hangs a bag of Gold and asks the prostitute to get her fees from the MIRROR. If service is virtual reward is also virtual. In sedition laws if the 'crime' is talking then the punishment should also be 'talking'2)USA Laws protect a person who burns the National Flag as the crime is CONSIDERED virtual and is not action. State acts when the 'crime' is in action3)In Kedar Nath Singh’s Case, 5 judges of the Supreme Court – a Constitution bench – made it clear that allegedly seditious speech and expression may be punished only if the speech is an ‘incitement’ to ‘violence’, or ‘public disorder’. Subsequent cases have further clarified the meaning of this phrase. In Indra Das v. State of Assam and Arup Bhuyan v. State of Assam, the Supreme Court unambiguously stated that only speech that amounts to “incitement to imminent lawless action” can be criminalised.There is a flaw in the LOGIC  of supreme court. How can an INDIVIDUAL be punished for the actions of the mob - particularly when India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] as the reservation policy agitation of Kapus and Jats showed. IS IT THE FAULT OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAT INDIA HAS BECOME EXPLOSIVE? HOW SHOULD THE INDIVIDUAL KNOW IN ADVANCE if a situation will explode? The faulty logic of mixed economy[read article on mixed economy down below] and acts of VP Singh, which made the constitution anti-National. Indira Gandhi has made the constitution anti-national by inserting socialism[as by definition legal robbery, as distinct from charity and implies forceful SNATCHING]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arun SHourie put the problem in two words Present BJP govt is congress+cow. He implied Modi has been a failure. Failed persons in politics can be dangerous. I strongly suspect that he will try to bring in private sector reservations and try to become another VP SIngh, who made the constitution anti-national along with Indira Gandhi when she inserted legal robbery of socialism into constitution.--------------------------------------------------------------------The solution is to apply merit to PM on the basis of  MERIT. I had recommended, earlier:Now BJP/RSS should be creative, PROACTIVE, and bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics. USA experience shows that goons kill each other in presence of free gun laws. None will kill with a legal weapon.2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=========================================================Mixed economy is a fascist economy. Bureaucracy/mafia politician becomes the supreme arbiter. Consider reservation policy: The only work of a government is protection of Individual rights - Jefferson, 2nd president of USA.. President of India as head of state has to commit suicide as merit, an Individual right, is murdered by reservation policy. The state is duty bound to protect Individual from mobs. Such arguments are not answered but ignored -- what the state does is right. Nazism was stateism like socialism. Those who could obtain power could justify state-sponsored murder and plunder by pointing out that since morals don't really exist and are merely a product of one's class or upbringing, there is no moral argument against the state version of murder and plunder.Socialism introduced into constitution during emergency is legal robbery. Way forward is capitalism[another name of freedom]Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim’s gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of money taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials and mafia politicians.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, but that it cannot be used honestly.Why does not the state allot a seat strictly on merit and snatch it away OPENLY?Gandhian Socialism of BJP is Gandhiism [selling of ones supporters to gain support of Jinnah and Muslims and Socialism is legal robbery]</comment>

<comment>100 years ago, untouchability was the norm. Now it has been banned in the constitution. Now why should the government concern itself with whom I consider 'untouchable'  ? if I consider a person untouchable, what is government's problem ? I won't harm him/her physically in anyway, but I will not let the untouchable in my kitchen which I consider 'pure'. How can government stop my thoughts about untouchability ? why does government need to ban untouchability.. Is not government interfering with my freedom to consider whom I want to be untouchable ?how does my view fit in with your theory that government should not interfere much and should give maximum freedomPS: Not trying to fix you, just wanted to know if you consider the provision of untouchability being banned constitutionally correct or not.</comment>

<comment>i stand by your opinon...if my level of hygiene is not maintained by you...i am sure i will not let u get in my house and sit on my sofa...i think most will do that way...this is also untouchability...how can govt stop this...</comment>

<comment>I only meant it hypothetically. I expected him to say1) that he denounces untouchability2) and he also opposes putting it in constitution as it is against freedom.  If someone wants to practise it at individual, he should be free to do so.I would support both 1) and 2)</comment>

<comment>Busy. I will reply in short. Economic development, particularly of women would lead to a situation, as a research paper showed, that women prefer INTERRACIAL sex. WHite women love black dikkks and vice versa.The solution is NOT to trust the bureaucracy and mafia politicians to do ANY good.</comment>

<comment>Congress is a mafia party, with its owner family hailing from the birth country of mafia. Congress is desperate. They are unable to fight Modi on development and other issues that matter for the welfare of the country. Therefore, they have plotted a number of deceptions to create chaos and confusion the country. The Jats agitation is, without doubt, planned and executed by Congress. Their henchman Hooda is the one who is implementing it. The audio clip recently released beyond all doubt implicates Congress in this dangerous game where unprecedented and unnecessary violence and loss has taken place. Congress does not care what disastrous precedence they are creating. For them discrediting Modi is the only aim and for that they would support Hafeez “Sahib” (as Salman Khurshid, former MEA addressed him), Lakhvi, ISI or anyone. They would place the entire country in any danger.Rohith episode is another of these cunning manipulators' trick. In JNU, they are all praise and support for Umer Khalid who raised series of slogans against the country. Polluting and misleading the young people of the country is a very dangerous and destructive ploy. It can turn violent and go out of control of even the people who fan the fire. But for Congress it does not matter. They want to see Modi out somehow and place the idiot Pappu on the throne of prime minister of India.The new Patel reservation hostilities are also organized and operated by Congress.They are also determined to ensure that no bill that would bring good to the nation is passed by the government in the parliament. The family has instructed the sycophants to cause maximum damage irrespective of any other concern so that Modi could be dislodged from position of Prime Minister.Just imagine what irreparable damage this party of sycophants are causing to bring their owner family back to power! There is no parallel to this anywhere in the world.Stoppage of corruption has blocked sources of money for the Congress. They want to come back so that they can further loot the country and fill their coffers. The family cannot think of losing ownership of the country which they have been fleecing for the last sixty and odd years. They are frantic. They will stoop to any level and any murderous act that would put the nation beyond a point of no return. People will have to be aware of this and act accordingly.</comment>

<comment>Poisonous and stupid - a deadly combination.</comment>

<comment>You call his politics poisonous today - our Pappu had declared it at Jaipur 3 years ago : "Power is poison" ! Unfortunately people of India gave power to BJP, so they have to accept poison too - don't blame our Pappu !</comment>
