<comment>Amitshah is right politicians should have retirement age some of them think that they can hang until they are taken for funeral; that is bad for democracy; they have to learn from developed democracy</comment>

<comment>No he is not right. Accept it or not, older leaders are better to lead the country. Because with age,comes wisdom. Youth and passion is not what's needed to run a huge nation like India. It's Experience, and maturity.</comment>

<comment>Are vai...this is effect of weed smoking ! He forgot about his master's age )))) hota hai...koi bat nehi taklu gunda.</comment>

<comment>His master look much younger than his age and he work round the clock</comment>

<comment>Headlines written in haste</comment>

<comment>Its a very valid and sensible statement. Most developed countries have below 60 leaders. But looking at challenged 45 year old pappu, I think we Indians should choose to remain an exception to the rule.</comment>

<comment>Remove Modi as PM as he is above 60. Make Arvind Kejrival PM.</comment>

<comment>When did kejriwal join bjp? </comment>

<comment>Ah! Now Shah wants to be PM, after all Modiji is 65 now!</comment>

<comment>Feku is 75 and going strong</comment>

<comment>He is 65 , at least don't lie retard</comment>

<comment>O I didn't know, should've done some fact checking...my point still stands though</comment>

<comment>pappu is 45+,u can have still chance --</comment>

<comment>Advaniji will not retire at 90 also.</comment>

<comment>Taklu should ask saheb to step down</comment>

<comment>Advani has lost all his sense if proportio. It is pathetic to see this oldie behaving in such a childish manner ganging up with the self seekers likes of Sinha,Shanta and Joshi.</comment>

<comment>This is the height of irresponsibility in journalism. you can't believe anything you read anymore. everything twisted out of shape. just plain lies all the time.</comment>

<comment>You said it.  Firstpost is desperate to publish anything, absolutely anything that they think will catch the eyeballs.  Idiotic journalism.</comment>

<comment>Is modi above 60 or less than </comment>

<comment>what is the requirement ? accordingly he will produce the DOB.</comment>

<comment>like the masters degree he received after 10th exam...</comment>

<comment>That's what you normally practice? </comment>
