<comment>I hope this time Badal loose. BJP needs to breakaway from this highly corrupt and drug selling party. BJP should go alone in the assembly elections. Badal should spend their last days in prison. No one deserves to go to prison more than badals except ofcourse the gandhis and vadras.</comment>

<comment>Politicians have been selling dreams to the gullible people ever since India became independent. But do people really have a choice? They have to vote for one or the other party, this or that politician even as the dream merchants laugh all the way to the assemblies or the Parliament getting not just a security for the next five years, but for the entire life.</comment>

<comment>Why opposition, Badal will remained CM for next 10 years or till his death with blessing of charismatic leadership of Feku PM of BJP</comment>

<comment>We would like AAP leaders to respond to Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal's comment that AAP leaders are like misguided missiles!</comment>

<comment>Had there been no split in AAP they could have done miracles like Delhi in Punjab.But spat with yogender & company has led to taking much sheen of this party. I don,t think they can have majority here. In case of hung assembly. They will loose in second round unlike Delhi.Bringing there folks together through ideological reconciliation is not expected from kejriwal given brut majority he has in Delhi and his stubborn haryani nature. But this will deny Indian chance for alternate at the centre. This is what AAP was born for.AAP needs to come out of bania party tag it is getting now.</comment>

<comment>Miracle in Delhi ? AAP govt? ?...AMAZING DELUSIONS OF AAP ZOMBIE</comment>

<comment>Badals are miserable failure in Punjab and head ache for BJP.No wonder their 4 seats were captured by AAP a coming up party in LS polls.It is almost sure they will be kicked out n the assembly elections of 2017.Mass s cale loting and leading luxurious life without caring about people Badals have resigned themselves to be out of power in two years.As Congress can do well under Amrinder Singh BJP will be the sufferer unless it takes efforts to keep distance from Badals and chalk out its own  strategy and not opt to be with Akali dal in the assembly elections and fight on its own and the main contender will e Congress and AAP will not be a force despite Kejriwal claiming otherwise as people are not happy with that fellow showing his tantrums always without merit..</comment>

<comment>Tantrums vs "65 years of corruption"....1st one is anyday better and will win for sure :)</comment>

<comment>Tantrums  without governance is very pathetic. .see Delhi. .but no one can talk sense to AAP zombies</comment>

<comment>Badal sahab should cool his heels in the cellar along with this family. As a coalition partner(-in-crimes), BJP in Punjab will have to face the consequences for this loot by Badal and Co.A new dispensation will form the government, and I would not be surprised if Khujlikhan can succeed in tapping the anger to AAP's benefit. It will not be the first time in Indian politics that people will vote for an alternative between otherwise two dominant parties (eg. BJP-SAD or Congress&Co). In Tamil Nadu, people were fed up with the only two parties that seem to matter - AIADMK and the DMK, that in one election when an id1ot who called himself "Captain" and an absolute pain-in-the-wherever formed a party called DMDK, he cornered a lion's share of votes (11%) ending up as a big time spoiler than anything else. He then allied with AIADMK before becoming an opponent and was then courted by Modi during his LS campaign in TN. And there can be no greater $ickhead than him that people could vote for.After all, all that freeloader will have to do is to make wild accusations by waving a sheet of papers and the media will breathlessly cover it.</comment>

<comment>so what do you want? Italian Mafia rule in Punjab?BJP+SAD will be kicked out, congress is dead anyways...it will be AAP sweep in Punjab, whether you like it or not :)</comment>

<comment>Are you from punjab ?? You seem to be very upbeat about watching daily mujras by AAP. ..but I don't envy you the choices. .everyone seems to be equally bad. .</comment>

<comment>Wasn't there a similar piece on Madhya Pradesh 's finances too? How come we read it only on fp and no where else?</comment>
