AFP"I did not join hands with Modi. I joined hands with the people who joined hands with Modi," Mufti told reporters after her meeting with Vohra."The Governor wanted to know where we stand on government formation in Jammu and Kashmir," she said. "I don't have that vision which Mufti sahab had, neither do I have the experience," Mehbooba said.Saying that PDP faced various challenges in the ten months of alliance with BJP, Mehbooba further said, "We want a government which will actively address the problems in Jammu and Kashmir."Mehbooba's cryptic statements on government formation in Jammu and Kashmir came hours after BJP attributed the continued uncertainty over government formation in Jammu and Kashmir to "adamancy" of ally PDP while asserting that it is committed to the common minimum programme of the coalition.BJP is sticking to the "agenda of alliance" but "adamancy is from PDP", state party unit's general secretary (Organisation) Ashok Koul had told PTI in Jammu.Lessons from J&K impasse: Leaders of house groups must decide about coalitions, not party bossesBJP slams Mehbooba Mufti, says political crisis in Jammu and Kashmir is due to PDP's adamancyMehbooba, BJP leaders to meet governor NN Vohra over govt formation in J&K"From our side there is positivity and we feel the same from other side. There is no uncertainty from BJP side," he had said.His comments came just hours ahead of the party leaders' meeting with Governor NN Vohra who had asked the coalition partners BJP and PDP to clarify their stand on government formation.The political crisis in Jammu and Kashmir arose after the demise of incumbent chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed on 7 January.Sayeed's daughter Mehbooba had said on Sunday that before taking a call on continuing the alliance, she wants to "reassess" whether the Narendra Modi government would take substantive steps within a 'set time-frame' to address the "core" political and economic issues of the state.PDP, with 27 MLAs in the 87-member Assembly and BJP with 25 legislators, ran a coalition government headed by Mufti Sayeed for 10 months before his demise on 7 January.With inputs from PTI
