<comment>Whatever be the feelings against Kejriwal, his one year in office has been commendably successful. BJP cannot claim this about their Government in Delhi. Their performance has so far been dismal, to say the least. Their credibility among people is fast waning. BJP and its leadership would do well to analyze his performance as CM and take lessons from his performance, if they do not want to be discarded by people in 2019.</comment>

<comment>If the Congress and BJpee released their own list of failures there would be a shortage of paper created to write down the huge numbers of them. Chief among them the failure to oust the AAP through all the crooked means possible. </comment>

<comment>KHAMOSH  !….. I am Zahir Ud-din Muhammed Babur – a.k.a Emperor Babur, Master of Short and Dark Hindu Slaves….. I am disappointed that you Hindu slaves have gone back to your infighting again… Now I will unite all lands of India, Pakistan and Afghanistan again under one rule, under one God Allah and under one flag of Islamic Caliphate. Everybody will behave and obey…. Just like in the old times….. Smriti Irani will wear a Burkha during the day and dance at gazal parties at night and serve as a “saki”. Ugly Nitin Gadkari will not  F A R T but hand out land allotments to W H O R E Hema Malini a.k.a. Aisha Bi R. Chakravarty and Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel’s daughter through Waqf Board…..Delhi will be called “Baburabad”.</comment>

<comment>If this campaign will be like the booklet campaign against the land bill and award wapsi, we know we will have tiny books with the lotus flag cover that party members will pose with and no one including the ones who belched the steaming pile would bother to read.</comment>
