<comment>Emergency and socialist congress terrorists hoisting national flag in RSS office?. Actually it became Indira Gandhi's flag after emergency. Congress chief's Barooah words still vibrant "India is Indira and Indira is India" - then it must be true of National flag as well. Socialism[legal robbery] introduced into constitution during emergency HAS to lead to single party [single family in India] dictatorship.----------------------------------------------------------------------Interestingly the Topiwallah Khejriwal does not speak of free speech1)If cannibalism and human sacrifice is practiced in a country can it be democratic?2)Simply voting does not make a Nation democratic. India was and is a Ocholocracy [mob rule] because by definition Individual rights like merit is murdered by reservation policy and Individual rights like property rights was murdered by socialism [legal robbery]. Along with voting Individual [smallest minority ] rights should be protected.3)Interestingly socialism was introduced into constitution by Indira Gandhi, CPI and KGB during emergency. And reservation policy was promoted and encouraged by British Bureaucracy which saw to it that Indian share of GDP fell from 28% after East India Company's rule to 3%. Like all governments it was inefficient spend thrift and became bankrupt4)Laws should be made guaranteeing free speech, BECAUSE India should not be backward. The old colonial law restricting free speech IS anti-national</comment>

<comment>Shame Shame...</comment>

<comment>Blind in opposing RSS....Doing wrong reporting....</comment>

<comment>Misreporting</comment>

<comment>Misreporting....no barge....its voluntarily by RSS...</comment>

<comment>Till now we used to have good entertainment by the political jokers of AAP and Cong (Pappu & Dappu Games). Now both have withdrawn to their den after the JNU incident. So it is the turn of other Congress leaders to fill the void with unlimited amusement</comment>

<comment>What barge !!! Such gross misreporting by FP,worthy of being labelled as those by VK Singh ! When Congressis tried to barge into the office, they were politely invited to come inside with roses and offered tea and snacks and then flag was hoisted jointly. That is the truth !! FP if your fellows do not know !!</comment>

<comment>Great job Congressis....</comment>

<comment>Does congress too wants to hoist national flag on all organizations? If so its a great news for country.</comment>

<comment>the pic published by FP shows 'chaddis' paying attention to Triranga while patriot congis looking for media attention.what did these patriots achieved? Yes they reassured the nation that RSS is nationalist and respects Tiranga.</comment>

<comment>For not protesting to congress attempt the bjpigs wont get bread today ðŸ˜€</comment>

<comment>whn will u start speaking the truth. or chng ur name.</comment>

<comment>The day chewtea gay starts delivering !</comment>

<comment>whatever!</comment>

<comment>Yes...the media conveniently avoids the aftermath...on RSS members welcoming the Congies to hoist the flag...one should ask the question to some of the Media morons...are you also involved in instigating people to anarchy</comment>

<comment>Congratulations to Arun Yadav and other Congress patriots. Please ensure that only tricolor is saluted as the national flag in all RSS shakhas, not a piece of orange colored cloth.</comment>

<comment>u r mad or wat. its nowhere mention in law that an organisation need to hoist the flag. they are not shouting anti India slogan that is suffice. do u even know that our 5 brave soldiers martyred and what kashmiri mosque did. they played recording of pakistan jive and praised terrorist.</comment>

<comment>You should know that rss never show any soliderity on indian  national flag and constitution. Not bangladeshi, indian history says this . However , you may not realise. </comment>

<comment>how about madrasas and mosques ,</comment>

<comment>I have not mentioned about the temples also. However, in many temples of India, the flags of the erstwhile princely states are still flying on top of them.</comment>

<comment>they are built of land granted by the erstwhile rulers of princely states unlike churches and mosques built on encroached land like B. masjid of ayodhya</comment>

<comment>These lands, after the merger ot these states with the Union of India belong to the Government of India, isn't it?</comment>

<comment>because they are owned by mutts and the states /rulers which gave land for construction of temples to mutts , but well churches and mosques we know is built from illegal encroached land like babri masjid for ex</comment>

<comment>temples never fly flags only on occasions , , but as a proud indian national accept your suggestion to fly flags on temples , when are you going to start taking out the green and white flags and start flying the saffron flags</comment>

<comment>We will salute who and what we want.... JNU row is only to smash socialistsBhagwa forever</comment>

<comment>No Indian citizen should be allowed to salute any flag except the tricolor as the national flag. A saffron peice of cloth can not replace the trioclor.</comment>

<comment>its nowhere replaced. so stop dis when u dont know d fact.</comment>

<comment>Only RSS should hoist it and what about other organizations??</comment>

<comment>There is only one pseudo-nationalist organization in India - RSS.</comment>

<comment>yes... india means nothing ... just a peice of landhinduism means everything</comment>

<comment>Then why shouting nationalism ? why arrest kanhya ! A very newly invented concept . never heard. </comment>

<comment>this is just to crush the pseudo-secular-socialists</comment>

<comment>Sorry don't overestimate yourself . you have no guts to do that . the bunch who have no minimum courage to reveal their name and pass the name of old heros asia of him are can't not even touch us - we run they nation and will do so  </comment>

<comment>no you don't  .... RSS and true Hindus rule India, we don't need to touch you, you are fading into oblivion</comment>

<comment>Hinduism is spread across the world. In India, all hindus are Indian first.</comment>

<comment>for the moment yes ... thanks to decades of congi-socialist-pseudo-secularistbrainwashing...... ut how long will this make-belief last?</comment>

<comment>HAHAHA. Best news  i read all day</comment>

<comment>Ha ha ha ha. I pity you...</comment>

<comment>Awww... is the chuddi buddy feeling bad that the National flag replaced the saffron rag?</comment>

<comment>Someday chaddi color would also be changed ðŸ˜„</comment>

<comment>Ha ha! I still pity you. Cause if you see the photo close you can see one gang saluting the flag while another being exposed. Go read real news vs blabbering on the forum about chaddis...</comment>

<comment>Yeah... It still had to be raised by One group as the other group didn't want the national flag. Nothing you say can hide the fact. #RSSagainstnationalflag.</comment>

<comment>Other group did not shout down down India questioning the country's integrity. #Indiaagainstantiationals</comment>

<comment>You mean saffron asswipe rag lol</comment>

<comment>Posted distorted news.</comment>

<comment>Why post half news??</comment>

<comment>Half news is for half chaddis like you</comment>

<comment>Why dont you tell the whole story as it unfolded...12 members from congress were welcomed inside with tilak on forehead and were offered refreshments by RSS sakha workersPost this the RSS workers fixed the tricolour with flowers, incense sticks and garlands.After the RSS workers were done, the Congress delegation was welcomed to the rooftop to unflur the flag !!Result: The entire game that congress was playing by getting into a confrontationist mode was diffused... RSS is not against flying the tri colour on its sakhas... Its just like any party office (congress, CPI, JDU, AAP etc.) that will have its party flag on its mast...Poor congress, the whole event was a phuss and Firstpost here is giving out half truth to save congress's embarrassment !!</comment>

<comment>I stopped reading at "Offered refreshments by RSS workers"Guess what refreshments Mr Godse offered, a couple of bullets. Come to think of it, loyal RSS pigs like you need to be 'refreshed' by a couple of RSS workers </comment>

<comment>ha ha ha ha ha....u brain is half filled...i pity ur mother..nalayk beteko janam diya...he he he he....my vote to modi</comment>

<comment>Good culture , your mother must be proud of you for your language . its expected from team bjp or team rss</comment>

<comment>n wat about congress rita aunty, who said its a shameful decision to hoist flags in university</comment>

<comment>u amuse me ? the guy before was more vitriolic . sorry did not see ur name bengali babu - leftie anti nationalist</comment>

<comment>You should pity your r andi mom who gave birth to you, have a good look at your fathers down every corner of the street, you f ucking rabid street dog.</comment>

<comment>Why can't same thing did try in idaga maidan in Karnataka ? They can force nationality on muslims</comment>

<comment>Bjp's nationalism heights : 1. Mentor : RSS - never wheists national flag 2. Partner : PDP - mufti termed afzalguru    as "  shahid " </comment>

<comment>Sir jee...stop u'r commie lies.RSS hbeen foisting flags ever since 2002.Prior to 2002, it was a crime to hoist national flag on private buildings, courtesy congress rule..</comment>

<comment>Wrong - RSS like every organisation hoists national flag on occasions like independence day an republic day and since 2002 has been hoisting it at all important functions... it didnot do it before 2002 because it was illegal for a non-govt institution to hoist the tricolour on its building under the old flag code... this was changed when SC passed an order in Naveen Jindal Vs Union of India case in 2002 allowing private entities and individuals to fly the national flag... dont fall for congress's lies.. they are lying through their teeth !!!if congress is lying under its teeth dont fall for it..Most of Kashmir valley MLA's have called afzal a hero... including congress MLA'sPlease know facts before commenting...</comment>

<comment>congressi still call him afzal ji, n rita bhaguna said its a shameless decision to hoist flag</comment>

<comment>until recently,  R. SS never hoisted the Indian flag. They always have the ideology to make India as Hindu rastra and Manu Smriti as there constitution and BHAGWA DWAJA(saffron flag) as national flag .They didn't agreed to believe in the indian constitution, which believes in secularism and tri-colored flag with ashoka chakra in the middle indication of unity</comment>

<comment>everyone have their ideolgoies and untill and unless its not harmful for nation it is ok. saffron is color of Hinduism and RSS support it but it never asked every one to hoist saffron flags and never disrespect Indian Flag.further RSS is far better as it atleast never taught ppl to celebrate death of Indian army soldiers, which madrassas are doing.</comment>

<comment>But JNU and congress people are even worse because they are supporting anti nationals who want the breakup of this country. Congress flies the national flag but supports anti nationals. Wow what an irony.</comment>

<comment>killings of Gandhiji worst anti national.  Those  who are responsible for it are now in power and garlanding Gandhi statues publicly but hero worshiping Gandhi killers privately</comment>

<comment>A strange comment unrelated. You pl read they news ! </comment>

<comment>guys please don't follow this website , it survives on negative news</comment>

<comment>Negative when against the team bjp and very positive when in favour.Kanhya kumar is favourable but  others - note. Nationalim favourable but rss - negative . Clannished hypocrisy . </comment>

<comment>exactly , we will boycot your e paper</comment>

<comment>obivously..if we show ur family videos which is morphed even ull be forced to hate... ... my vote to modi</comment>

<comment>That is since voted you will vetoed for a protest for wrong doings ! finding facism in you . </comment>

<comment>Hypocrisy is when Kamlesh Tiwari is jailed for his speech while JNU students go scot free for their anti national speech.</comment>

<comment>thnks for raising this here else ppl have already found a new hero in umar khalid</comment>

<comment>As you said they do hoist on national days, no one does every day because we have to maintain the flag as per rules, some times it is not possible. Congress expected opposition but they did find it</comment>

<comment>In this matter alone the Congress party is correct because the RSS indeed has  national stature as an organization.</comment>

<comment>Islam gonna be destroyed by Donald TRUMP... hahahahaheard the Folk story narated by Trump about shooting with pork laced Bullets of 49 moslem Mindanao Insurgents who were against Americans in Phillipines n the General let go the 50th terrorist to go back n tell wat happened... hahahha..</comment>

<comment>After headley, it's trump . . then ? ! ! dream land us of a.</comment>

<comment>FYI, who all don't know RSS raised the Indian flag in Dadra and Nagar Haveli when Mr. Nehru was even opposing its liberation.</comment>

<comment>FYI, there have been only three arrests in independent India for hoisting an Indian flag...and all were arrested after RSS complained to the police after they had hoisted the national flag in their headquarters</comment>

<comment>Sir, that's because Dadra and Nagar Haveli was not Indian territory then. But the scenario you are talking about is different, since Indian constitution did not allow private individuals, companies, organizations to hoist national flag. The law of the land is a factor in your comment, otherwise you are correct to say so, only when law allows and RSS complains.</comment>

<comment>LOL..Do you it was Nehru and Congress who made it a crime to hoist national flag on private buildings?It was BJP and RSS who fought to change it in 2002.Learn your history dumbo..</comment>

<comment>Don't doctored history.your history is home made of rss. you had opposed nataji also. </comment>

<comment>This is wrong news. RSS welcomed them with sweets and raised the flag with CONgrass leaders. FP is trying to show as if CONgrass forced RSS. This is called brainwashing agenda to highlight CONgrass as good and others as BAD. Unfortunately many fall for it.</comment>

<comment>Rss invited congress with sweet ! !  A real andoh original joke for life time . Q bhai bjpse tana tuta kya ? another scary jock.</comment>

<comment>Read carefully, I said RSS welcomed him. It means when Congress leaders came, RSS welcomed them, gave them sweets and hoisted the national flag together. It is not mentioned by the newspaper, they twist it showing as if Congress forced to get credit it. This is how media's twist of words brainwash us, when we do not know the truth. Perhaps you misunderstood what I said, that's y you got excited.</comment>

<comment>pl RIP in ur bangladesh. do not bother we Indians</comment>

That's why i told you to chop your nonsense utters to avoid showing hollow safronised stupid brain.</comment>

<comment>If thats do why dont chaddi raise mational flag on each branch of theirs?</comment>

<comment>I know you were excited as you said this. Do you know the rules for hoisting flags for private organizations or social service organizations? Does it allow organizations like RSS to hoist? To brush your knowledge, pls read history. RSS was the first to hoist our tricolor in Dadra and Nagar Haveli union territory when India was fighting to get it from Portugese. Mr. Nehru (your guruji from Gandhi family) protested it, but still RSS hoisted it. Pls read history and then do bakchodi. Don't be blind with your eyes and heart in the hatred you have for others.</comment>

<comment>Now they even started saying CONGRESS IS ANTI NATIONAL HAaaaaaaa.....? Think again and ask the question !Can anybody say his own dad is not his dad?....Just because your dad is old and don't know the new ways of mass media propaganda marketing doesn't mean he is not your dad.He will always be your dad.You can ignore history,change history, twist history,place your agents in the news rooms for propaganda and selectively misrepresent facts.But no matter how much you try the genetics can't be erased .If you disagree just ask the following genetic questions ?When we got liberated, even the sewing needle was imported in our country.Within 4 years, in 1951, first IIT at Kharagpur was started. with in 15 years, till 1962 all original five IITs started functioning. AIIMS was made in 60's, Bhilai Steel Plant, fertilizer factories, BARC, Space research all came during Nehru's time. list is long to go on typing. And remember he started with a clean slate, no economy and nothing to build on and also with the pangs of partition of the country (who is responsible for it is irrelevant), hostile PAK with first war as early in 1948 (with PAK).Like humans, he also committed mistakes, had his share of vices and failures but can you ignore his contribution towards laying basic developmental infrastructure in the country?STILL NOT CONVINCED ?Ask more questions!!A)>>>Which political party fought the war of Indian Independence, drafted the Indian Constitution,given fundamental rights to its citizens,fought the war of integration of different administrative units,kingdoms,princely states and brought all of it under a single union. ?B)>>>Which political party ruled India integrating its pluralism with out any administrative and constitutional failure for 50 years when most of the countries which received Independence in the same time disintegrated and fall in to complete chaos of governance ?C)>>>Which political party created the Indian judiciary, Indian Legislature,Indian Executive system ,Presidents office, PM,Cabinet,Council of misters, Panjayathi Raj and initiated a federal structure and given maximum freedom and operational Independence to its states in-order to protect the uniqueness of each states ?D)>>>Which political party created the Roads, communication network ISRO our ARMED FORCES Military and paramilitary forces, RBI and other financial Institutions, media infrastructure,media rights and freedoms,Economic Liberalization of 1991, RTI act, Information Technology Industry infrastructure in IndiaZ)>>>>WHICH POLITICAL PARTY JUST BORN IN 6 APRIL 1980 (35 years ago) RULED FOR ALMOST 7 YEARS AND CLAIMS CREDIT FOR DEVELOPMENT ,PATRIOTISM ,NATIONALISM and DIGITAL INDIA .?</comment>

<comment>See no one deny that congress did work, but they ruled so long. and since the Independence they there is slogan is "hum garibi hatayenge" but after 60 plus year of Independence d conditions are same. most of our antiques are gone to Italy. can u Imagine a son in law, who is not eve npolitician was exempt from checking at airport. y? this is wat congi has given to us.Manmohan Singh allowed China trade and in 10 years we were totally dependent on our enemy country. the production houses were shut down. young genration relied on BPO's. this is what was done wrong.do u know abt Maruti scam done by Sanjay Gandhi, sure u don't. do u know Congis swiss accounts and when Sanjay Gandhi died Indira asked for his keys and watch - wat a Mother India.it is the work of true nationalist who take our nation to the pave of success. Congress has also given us Naxalites, supported LTTE, and alpha.Bloody Nehru give Kashmir to Pak, Shastri called back the army when they acquired places till Lahore.china our mansarovr was given by ur Nehru to China.for u ppl party matters but for us Country matter the most. BTW it was Mnamohan singh who said Muslim have more rights in INdia. the dalit and quota card was always played by Congress.als, pl come out of the world of ur assumption where congress did everything for nation. no they take India as their Baap ki Zagir only. coz when Indira loss election Sanjay Gandhi want sole rule of Indira Gandhi.</comment>

<comment>So with that logic..Before congress what was the reason .say last 10000 years .....And why countries which got independence,much smaller countries still remain political mess ..India was a collection of 10000 countries which were never part of a single union ....Even TN is bigger than Germany as a country ...Secondly with the exploitative caste system ..how do you suppose to get more that what they have got ..Blaming is very easy ...When you have no reference point to compare on Indian uniqueness how can you just say ,its becoz of congress</comment>

<comment>if u would have talk about India I WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY not said anuthing, but here u r doing gaga of Congress. also, they were separate states n not country.</comment>

<comment>Bro even my state Kerala was 3 countries .....Must read Integration of Indian states..Make a search ..Am definitely not a fan of congress..But fact is fact ...</comment>

<comment>India developed inspite of Congress and not because of Congress. What are all these factories? India could have hundred times more of these factories had Nehru encourage private initiative, enforced correct policies and put in place a sincere and enlightened buereuacracy but he failed in all this. Chinese invasion, the festering wound of Kashmir, the staggering poverty and hundreds of other failures is all a result of Nehru's failed governance.</comment>

<comment>Congress created India as a country...it was just a collection of 10000 nations,castes and creed</comment>

<comment>Dude...The jawans died in the Kashmir valley in the last 2 years is much more the last 10 years combined (from 2004 to 2014). Daily basis now we have atleast 2-3 infiltration attempts in Kashmir valley. One of my sanghi friend said as soon as Modi declared as a PM candidate, China pulled back it's forces from Arunachal and Pakistan piss on it's pants and stop firing at LOC, yes earlier China tried to intrude only thru Arunachal, but now there submarines are roaming in Indian ocean which never happened prior 2014..:) Even they are trying to setup a base in Nepal and Srilanka, yes, you can attribute these as the milestones of BJP govt within a span of 2 years ruling..:)        One of their sensational propaganda/promise was bring back the 13 lakh crore black money stashed in swiss bank within 100 days of change of rule, even after 2 years, not even a single penny came back and as per the latest estimates the black money reduced from 13 lakh crore to 7k crore..:) Another hypocrisy of this govt is they blame UPA for their tax laws and call their policies as tax terrorism, and now pls tell me just 1 example where you pay less tax compare to UPA, this blood sucking govt even taxing the money you earn in abroad. Another good example is the Diesel prices, during UPA each litter of diesel had a subsidy of Rs 14 which was a huge burden on the govt, but now this blood suckers earning Rs 15 as levy on each litter of diesel apart from all other taxes and still they couldn't stick to their election promise of OROP as it supposed to be implemented..    The industrial production is on its historical low, the share market is crashing on daily basis, FDI is coming down, Rupee is depreciating and national integrity itself is at risk now...          So talked about Nehru's failed governance, what do you call it? Nehru had to build this country from the scratch, but after all this ground work done  still the present govt is struggling to build further..Luckly after independence , Indian economy is in it's strongest position not because of the NDA govt policies, but because of the historical low of crude prices, but still NDA couldn't bring the country back to track...</comment>

<comment>According To Flag Code Of India Citizens Of India Did Not Had The Right To Hoist The Indian Flag Except For Some Important Days Like Republic Day, Independence Day And Mahatma Gandhi's Birthday. A Renowned Industrialist Naveen Jindal Challenged This In The Court As When He Hoisted The Flag On His Office Building He Was Told Not To Do So As It May Be Taken As A Breach Of Code Of Indian Flag. Then He Lodged A PIL (Public Interest Litigation) In The Court Now The Decision Of The Court Is Pending In This Regard But A Temporary Permission Has Been Granted To Indian Citizens To Hoist The Flag On Any Day But In A Respectable Manner.</comment>

<comment>Is that meant - RSS won't bcz it can't respect ? be clear </comment>

<comment>The commies are brain dead...</comment>

<comment>Good....fartpost has grown to this extent that anybody who wants to spit at prstitutes can straight away use the comments section</comment>

<comment>Don't spit on prostitutes. They are in the profession to make ends meet. Nobody is in it for fun meeting all kind of dangerous, violent,abusive men. A little bit of sympathy from you will not hurt.You fight your political battles but don't do it on poor people who are virtually selling their body and soul for survival.</comment>

<comment>read properly and then respond..ur "O" makes a lot of difference.... u r right...compared to the above entity prostitutes are so very decent and dignified</comment>

<comment>Black money is back..stop reading pressstitutes. Go to govt web site.one Italian marine is already back..another will be too...If you want to blame some one, blame congees who agreed for Italian marine to go on vacation.It has nothing to do with BJP or Modi..But, AAPholes as usual as brain dead because of smelling too much of kejru's farts..</comment>

<comment>Shameless reporting this guy should be questioned why he is doing this third rate reporting </comment>

<comment>This is biased reporting. You should have mentioned that sanghis welcomed them. Even in the pic a guy can be seen standing at attention</comment>

<comment>Firstpost is the worst yellow news set up in India  it is reported that RSS people served laddoos to congees. This site should be reported for false news if there is a law to curb false reporting.  </comment>

<comment>There are photos of RS workers in Indore welcoming the congees, offering them Ladoos ..then they themselves took them to the pole where the flag was hoisted ..YOU ARE SUCH A SCUM GHOSE THAT YOU COULDNOT WRITE THE TRUTH!!(Remove spaces b4 com and after :)https: //mobile.twitter. com/kaushkrahul/status/701700146812178433</comment>

<comment>Chaddis saw no option opposing it ... Would be Caught pants down ... :)</comment>

<comment>Indore to bas jhanki haiNagpur bhi baaki haiROFL</comment>

<comment>Congress workers were welcomed by RSS members and fed with snacks for hoisting National Flag at RSS office.</comment>

<comment>Chaddis saw no option opposing it ... Would be Caught pants down ...</comment>

<comment>Same enthusiasm people want from Congress to hoist National flag in Lal Chowk, Srinagar.Sapore and in other places in Kashmir.Gulam Nabhi Azad to lead.</comment>

<comment>Oh they won't show it buddy, aye the muh kala karne, khud ke muh pe hi kaalikh pot li, sanghis welcomed them with teeka, and made breakfast for them, ha ha ha, khangressi stooges </comment>

<comment>Is it true? I mean first hand news?</comment>

<comment>Yes congees wanted to play. RSS played better.   Burnol folks. This site had become cheap with these reporters </comment>

<comment>Chaddis saw no option opposing it ... Would be Caught pants down ...so generously accepted it..</comment>

<comment>MP is a BJP ruled state for Last 3 terms.  So congees are a micro minority there . this is simple congees wanted to create a tension in MP and try to create an impression that they were also nationalist and RSS wasn't.  This fell flat. RSS was smarter. They did not use force instead gave laddoos to these thugs as they came there to raise national flag.  But beware congress is trying to create as much tension as possible in India using every opportunity  jatt issue is an example.  If left untreated attended these guys will create a situation which can harm the country </comment>

<comment>Any ways they allowed it as they respect national flag.  MP is BJZp for the third time congees are insignificant in MP</comment>

<comment>Yes my friend just confirmed it ,</comment>

<comment>Why is it prohibited to hoist on Congress party office?</comment>

<comment>what a joke!RSS folks welcomed them to hoist ... and these gutter snipes make a big deal out of it!And look at the biased media.... quotes congi goons that bully their way with the tiranga but does not care to carry a soundbite from the host patriots?  Shame on the media!</comment>

<comment>Sir, do you have first hand info?</comment>

<comment>Yes read CNN ibn report fully </comment>

<comment>Got confirmation from a sanghi friend from Indore itself.</comment>

<comment>Wow ...It's time Nagpur & jhandewala premises are invaded by india ...Bharat mata ki Jai ...</comment>

<comment>Brilliant work. That's how you stamp the arses of the RSS</comment>

<comment>exactly..brilliant way to stamp the RSS..RSS would take that any day....</comment>

<comment>What brilliant work? As if you people tried to put a Pakistani flag? It is Indian flag and RSS has never an objection unlike the pseudos. Let Congress respect the legends of yesteryear congress first. Sardar Patel, Lal Bahadur, Martyr Subhash Chandra Bose, Martyr Bhagat Singh, Mualana Azad, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Jhansi Rani ........ and not the dumb family of Jowahar, Indira, Madam, Son...</comment>

<comment>If RSS wanted they could have finished these idiots but then they came to hoist national flag and RSS served laddoos to them.    For the first time after many years congees were forced to respect national flag and not photos of Italians </comment>

<comment>Yeah the congress forced their way into the chaddi HQ and were 'forced to respect' national flag. Lol wtf chaddi, even basic common sense escapes you.</comment>

<comment>That is the truth and truth some times require a lot of burnol for congees </comment>

<comment>How much burnol did you donkeys eat when you won the Delhi and Bihar elections?</comment>

<comment>With one state of consequence left behind congees have exhausted all burnol in the country after Kerala and Assam there will be burnol shortage because congees will need quite s lot. Then only Karnataka left for 2 years then total wipe out.  India can look forward to better days from then on </comment>

<comment>Congees were served laddoos for becoming patriots more congees to follow.  Burnol friend. Congees tried to play to gallery and RSS stole the show.  Congees bootlickers bought a lot of burnol</comment>

<comment>Yeah RSS stole the show when their saffron asswipe flag got showed down by the Tiranga. How retarded can you get, chaddi.</comment>

<comment>Don't cry congee bootlicker. RSS is a nationalist organisation and support hoisting of tiranga even though congees wanted to make it a scene they got screwed up.  Why do you cry even if you cannot digest this. RSS did a great job. You cannot understand patriotism buddy you need to be a nationalist first.  </comment>

<comment>Rss nationalist ! - The team don't hoists tricolor--the team don't respect secular status, constitutional fact - supports godse Most corrupt</comment>

<comment>That is your opinion. There are millions who believe other wise  by the way that is freedom of expression and not antinationalism </comment>

<comment>Yeah your patriotism begins and ends with the celebration of godse divas.</comment>

<comment>Thats all you can think about Indians. How is patriotism defined in Italy my friend ?? </comment>

<comment>Patriotism in Italy is defined as letting the marines go scot free even after they were caught red handed killing Indian fishermen. </comment>

<comment>So you know about Italy better than India be there comment on them you need to know about India </comment>

<comment>Hey chaddi licker, do you or your feku bhagwan know what is to be done to get justice for our dead fishermen? </comment>

<comment>Looking forward to Modi to take take tough actions against all anti nationals who have made India So weak in 60 years. Italians are insignificant to India.  </comment>

<comment>Phekuworshiper, I asked you a question, how does your fake God decide to punish the Italians who killed those fishermen</comment>
