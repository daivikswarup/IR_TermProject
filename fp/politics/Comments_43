<comment>When is Maunendra coming back from his "char-dhaam" yaatra?</comment>

<comment>Think logically, BJP Govenment is in power in MP for more than a decade. Do you believe any scam of such proportion take place without those in government not involved ?Now BJP is in power in both state and centre. They are killing witness and ensuring everyone that the top leadership is safe. There is no doubt about it. The thing is during congress corruptions , people were not killed. Now the govenments are doing corruption but will destroy the evidence and kill witnesses. </comment>

<comment>Even the Judges of MP High court are BJP/RSS supporters...That is why the MP government is getting favorable verdicts...BJP is in power of MP for last 12 years</comment>

<comment>.BJP = Congress + Murders + Terrorism + CommunalismDid you knw right wing terrorists did the malegaon bomb blasts and framed 9 muslims for it??RSS is worse than ISIS. Atleast ISIS claims responsibility for their bomb blasts.</comment>

<comment>I am actually laughing... good joke</comment>

<comment>Courts stayed the legal action against MP Governor, perhaps emboldening exam killers. Courts show lots of activism where their activism is NOT needed and is  harmfulSupreme court is pushing for blocking porn in India and BJP has agreed .=========================================================Socialist Press/activists in banana republic India acts as ideological Jailer. Socialism was introduced into constitution during emergency, with opposition in jail. Socialism is legal robbery as distinct from charityWhy do I call India as banana republic? India has not ratified 1988 United nations resolution on torture, with countries like Sudan and North Korea. The brainless movement against corruption by Anna has resulted the risk premium of corruption event going up - now aam admi  has to pay Rs.1000 instead of Rs.100 being paid previously for the same corruption. WHY ARE GANDHIANS ALWAYS BRAINLESS? Gandhi Topi appears to be a powerful tool of brainwashing.BJP GOVT SUPPORTING SUCH INITIATIVES will make it much more UNPOPULAR. Adult porn is OK BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON MUTUAL CONSENT OF ADULTS. Sushma Swaraj's initiatives as I&B minister caused BJP's defeat more than anything else. Already every clerk asking address proof is acting like a terroristIt is a shame that Supreme Court is indulging in judicial activism, in strangulating Individual freedom. Jefferson says "The ONLY work of a government is protection of Individual rights. Therefore Modi working 18 hours per day and strangulating individual freedom is meaningless. Restricting freedom may give a high for people in power, but it is suicidal for BJP. No one likes a prof. killjoy. Dont fall into trap.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Banning has never worked. banning liquor in USA made the mafia into a very big entity. Dawood will rule India, with large Indian population. That is the problem with idealists. I think he already is ruling - Vyapam's mysterious deaths looks like his hand. Legitimate capitalists, in search of PROFIT, like Narayana Murthy, etc are not allowed to open colleges, though they would like to[ license permit raj of socialism]. It is only THE POLITICALLY CONNECTED MAFIA CAPITAL which runs engineering and medical colleges. Hell was unleashed on India by Supreme Court, which observed "education should not be a business" - a unreal pious wish. If legitimate capital is not allowed mafia capital will enter.In India too banning corruption, by anti-corruption movement, may perhaps have resulted in Dawood Ibrahim taking over the lucrative business of corruption. IF there is any foul play, I suspect Dawood Ibrahim is behind it. If it is so, then investigation has to be given over to Military Intelligence. CBI will be out of depth on this.Government officials have become perverse, under stateist policies and no corruption. A clerk asked me - why did you change your address, when I went to get address changed in Adhar Card. In this way every clerk will become a terrorist. PM Modi should watch out. Whole sectors of economy like mining was halted by Supreme Court during mining scam breakout.Can Anna even understand this? In socialist economy for things to move the only way it can move is by corruption. The incentive for work has shifted from profit under capitalism to corruption and crime. Corresponding to it the agent has changed from capitalist to politically connected mafia capitalist.Further in socialism since public money is being dealt with, there is risk of litigation. If I were a government officer I would not risk anything and later be accused of corruption - I would simply sleep, create obstacles, take my salary and enjoy .IF INDIA IS DERAILED BY ANTI-CORRUPTION IDEALISTS, DAWOOD IBRAHIM WILL BRING INDIA BACK ON RAILS. How many times in its History has emergency been declared in USA in its history?</comment>

<comment>I don't understand why some one from the scam is not going to press and tell the entire story. There are thousands of people who are involved in  the scam so naturally they must be worried for their life. More than their career is life not important? Why somebody is not opening their mouth. And if nobody is involved in the scam then what point in shouting Vyapam Vyapam Vyapam?</comment>

<comment>political parties are involved, governor is involved, senior officers, senior police officers involved, high court judges are also under clouds of suspicion as their relative are beneficiary of scamâ€¦ just watch this entire videoâ€¦shameless politician trying to defend the un-defendable with foolish argumentsâ€¦.lets presume that all 45 murders are not related to Vyapam scamâ€¦but think about fraudsters who were not eligible for admission to medical collage but now became doctorâ€¦.how many lives these doctors will takeâ€¦God bless India!</comment>

<comment>Yes under BJP rule people will call god. Trahi Mam. Trahi Mam.</comment>
