<comment>unless brainless electorate keep voting such scoundrels in ....like Lalloo and KSR in local elections ...INDIA IS DOOMED ....</comment>

<comment>RIP Congress.</comment>

<comment>TRS has swept the GHMC elections so now KCR is  superb candidate for PM candidate in 2019 elections</comment>

<comment>Anywhere there is a third alternative to BJP and Congress, people are opting for it... Where there is no such situation, people are deserting Modi and have no other choice than Congress...</comment>

<comment>Just so that you know, BJP had never a great presence neither in TS or erstwhile United AP. The so called alternative which you are talking is nothing but an aberration. Have you checked what is happening in Bihar right now? 600 deaths since MahaGatabandhan came there. Totally lawlessness,if this the alternative which you are dreaming about. You should definitely worry about your own future..;-)</comment>

<comment>Ha Ha !! Hyderabad and Secundrabad are normally considered as  BJPee's fortress of strength !!What a lie spun  by a dumb Bhakth claiming that BJP never had a great presence in Telangana or United AP !!  The above election is for the Hyderabad City dear !!And this Chandrababu Naidu who was hailed for atleast  transforming Hyderabad sidestepping  rural Andhra in the process   just hasn't been able to convince the masses of his so-called good job of upgrading infrastructure in the City because they never felt that improvement on ground and it was just a goeebels propaganda   !!</comment>

<comment>Fortress of strength ? BJP got 5 seats in Hyderabad in 2009 out of 150, Congress had 52.In 2016, BJP has got 4 seats and Congress has 2.Next time google, if you don't want to come across as a complete dckhead.</comment>

<comment>Dunderhead - BJPee used to win Hyderabad Lok sabha seat and it is its stronghold !!  Why do you take just one instance to prove your point !!BJP got 4 seats because of its alliance with TDP while the Congress fought alone. So much for you trying to prove a point that the BJP performed better than Congress. Ha ha Ha !!</comment>

<comment>Well people aren't that stupid to not differentiate between lok sabha and municipal elections. If today it was lok sabha, people would have still votes for Modi. Your analysis is pretty fukn illogical. Bjp didn't do any better or worse. It was Congress which got fked.</comment>

<comment>"If today it was lok sabha, people would have still votes for Modi"--- Are you day-dreaming???</comment>

<comment>That's what they said before May 2014. You must have wet your pants that day and will do again in 2019.</comment>

<comment>When BJP had only 2 MPs in Loksabha in1985, one of them was from Hyderabad, who is even today an MP from the city... And your propaganda shall not and had not decided the fate of Bihar, people of the state are supreme...</comment>

<comment>are you Happy now, People are happy to go with the Ruling party and they are doing good job, now why do you make a theory of your own.Peole like you should be communists, or the Agents of the Church,  or Pakistani slaves</comment>

<comment>2019 will be the dawn of the Federal Front !!</comment>

<comment>More like Anti-Modi front with members who don't agree with each other, some who are just there to loot and others who don't give a rats a.$s about governance. Would be great for India.</comment>

<comment>100%</comment>

<comment>How many seats were bagged by the BJPee ?  I am sure it should have come ahead of the independents !?</comment>

<comment>These regional parties will give nightmare to saheb ...</comment>

<comment>Sonia amma gave Telangana to its people. People showed her the middle finger!...LOL!</comment>

<comment>And showed third leg from their lungi to fekuüòù</comment>

<comment>Don't worry for the death of the dead Congress, worry for Modi's future...</comment>

<comment>Don't worry about Modi's future,worry about your own...;-)</comment>

<comment>My own? Are you threatening me?? Are you a Sanghi Bhakt???</comment>

<comment>Looks like your pea-sized brain cannot interpret things in an objective way. Where does the threaten come from donkey,if I am saying that you should spend your time in building your own future? Are you a nut case?Did you forget that you started giving unsolicited advises here?</comment>

<comment>He is for sure a chaddi goon !</comment>

<comment>End of Harish Rao???</comment>

<comment>Where is BJP in the list??? I am searching.........................I am searching....................</comment>

<comment>In GHMC..Congress fell from 52 seats to 2 seat          &BJP fell from 5 seats to 4..But Psephologists out here are painting this as BJP loss .. Why ?? :-)</comment>

<comment>BJP got 4</comment>

<comment>Thnx for the info.</comment>

<comment>U will find dead bjpigs in graveyard or naidu's lungi üòÄüòÄ</comment>

<comment>I think it got a big nought literally humiliated in the polls !!</comment>

<comment>Nikamma modi bites the dust.</comment>

<comment>I am searching for AAP and Congress as well :)Oh...these morons think BJP supporters are against TRS....We are not baby.We wanted Congress to be decimated - checkMIM to be shown it's place - checkNow watch what will happen to MIM in Hyd..;)</comment>

<comment>Congress got few seats more than tdp n bjp üòä</comment>

<comment>And i'm searching for SS, SP, BSP and other parties. Oh wait AAP n others parties mentioned didnt contest elections. So the losers are - 2 main national parties (BJP n Cong) and TDP...</comment>

<comment>But BJP got decimated in the process???</comment>

<comment>grt shame dat rahulji tried 2 cash in on vemula case bt sad results in electns. 2 improv image aftr dis shameful loss vil rahul go 4 foreign vac snort coke bang his gf n return refreshd? media pimps can also write sum farticles. sibal saab rahulji ko koi naya punch line sikhao. suit boot ki sarkar purani ho gayi yaar, baat main aaj kal dum nahi hai.</comment>

<comment>BJP has to wake up from the complacency of last Loksabha win.</comment>

<comment>FYI prior to GHMC poll BJP had 5 seats only n scamgress had 50 seats...</comment>

<comment>Loss of Congress is not same as BJP's win.</comment>

<comment>It's not a loss either falling from 5 to 4 seats</comment>

<comment>What difference does it make whether you have 4 seats or 5 seats or even 10 seats, when the strength of house is 150?</comment>

<comment>Makes a difference because Congress fell from 52 to 2 and BJP from 5 to 4. I am happy Congress is wiped out. BJP needs to increase presence in south, that's a known.</comment>

<comment>KCR is silently becoming another Navin Pattnaik..   this election was  a cake walk for him...</comment>

<comment>Go n bite on 56" ka ch#ttad to wake him up n also remind him of black money !!!</comment>

<comment>KTR Established himself as a formidable political leader! Hats off!</comment>

<comment>Rohit couldn't fetch any votes for Rahul Baba. So sad. </comment>

<comment>Rohit was not supposed to fetch any votes in GHMC elections for Rahul anyway. Punjab and UP will show if there is any impact on BJP because of that.</comment>

<comment>Yeah..Chandigarh just showed the way to Congress.Go and check the local elections just finished there...</comment>

<comment>yeah, as if Chandigarh represents the Punjab demographics.</comment>

<comment>Not very excit d about TRS but very glad that MIM has been wiped out. Never in history, could BJP, TDP or congress could stop MIM as the votes got split and Muslims vote enmass to MIM. TRS did the unbelievable. Hyderabad will loose the stink of MIM</comment>

<comment>Are you a dreaming modi bhakt? If so wake up and see the result numbers. TRS has decimated BJP and Congress, MIM remains where it always was.</comment>

<comment>MIM has not been wiped out! Infact, they have gained a seat compared to the previous elections. However, since TRS has gained a complete majority, MIM can`t influence anything.</comment>

<comment>MIM has not been wiped out. it is still pretty strong in its den, purely due to religion and intimidation and nothing else.</comment>

<comment>Hearty congrats to TRS. However, what is happening in Telangana is neither good for the state nor for democracy.</comment>
