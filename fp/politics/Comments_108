<comment>What they should do is get the CMs of MP and Chhatisgarh in center. And let younger guys take charge there. BJP ain't gonna win 4th time there anyways.</comment>

<comment>NM was made CM of Gujarat by LK before NM had not even fought one democratic election leave aside winning any. LK has been the creator and mentor of NM. It would be fitting if NM listens to his creator and mentor- who also saved him from a clear sacking in the wake of Godhra.</comment>

<comment>party with a difference.  always takes their differences open in the public. the party may call it democratic tradition however, it is only gross indiscipline and nothing else.   why issue a post dated letter to press.  Advaniji and others must accept the fact that they are old and have no new ideas.  they had chance in 2004, 2009 but failed.</comment>

<comment>advani lost 2 general elections and lost delhi 3 times and maharasthra 3 times,  why is complaining now !!!!</comment>

<comment>On a positive note- those who lost can ask out of experience, those who fought 10 or more elections can ask too, those who founded and built the party from zero can ask too. Those who think can create a bigger party are welcome to found a new party beginning from their home state and see the pains as well as failures.</comment>

<comment>yes they can ask, but they cannot blame top 2 guys alone,political party is not a company in which the guy who started will own till the end !!!</comment>

<comment>What about staring anew party- in Gujarat by NM and AS? It took 50 years to start a party. The party cant be usurped or gobbled up by newbies. Accountability is essential. Those who want to thump chest and take credit, must stand up , thump chest and take discredit- this will ensure continued support and encouragement. There is a good opportunity to go to Bihar, same venues and thank people for having voted in whatever measure and repeat the promises. With such humility next elections will be easier and better- this is not the time to rebuke the Margdarshak and dance and roll in London. If you fail the exam, reappear as soon as possible, prepare better, correct mistakes and pass the exams. Voters have been so kind that they gave second opportunity to even Lalu in Bihar and to AK in Delhi. They are waiting to forgive and reassure but go with folded hands, without any arrogance or '' I was right, you are wrong- Voters'' attitude. Dont rebuke voters or critics.</comment>

<comment>party leaders have taken credit and discredit too !!! if you read the news the u will know Advani and vajpayee started in 1982 not 50 years as u said !!!.many people in BJP went to jail during emergency it was not only Advani. its was Vajpayee and Advani who won elections in 1996 and 98 it was not advani alone !!!.why do Critics only blame Modi, what about bihar state leaders , people lihe Shatru who think he can become CM,BJP never won Bihar on its own due to caste combinations so to expect BJP win itself is a big task , even Nitish cannot win on his own he had to ally with criminals like Laloo to win caste combination.Neither Advani nor Vajpayee had led BJP to victory in Bihar on its own !!!</comment>

<comment>Have they blamed anyone? Cant they ask questions from their proteges? The two went to his house to wish birthday- but they were very glum- as if they committed some crime and both unlike before did not touch feet of their master which both started on their own and did for 30 years. Those who stop learning- are punished by their own ignorance. Not correcting mistakes and stalling criticism may cost next election including the one inevitable in Varanasi.</comment>

<comment>Party leaders are answering why should they raise this in media , Modi will election don't worry , same people criticize Modi in Gujarat he won 3 state elections</comment>

<comment>They will raise internally as well as in media. What is wrong with that? Truth will ultimately prevail. Transparent and public disclosure as well as discussions are hallmark of democracy. Why gag? Going in media only helps if it is true. BJP spent 10,000+++  crores in Bihar and lost because voters did not like their version of truth. NM was made by Media and he needs to face squarely and upfront- that will bolster his prospects.</comment>

<comment>ROFL why should party leaders discuss in public !!!we all know turth , Advani wanted to be PM at such an old age !!!BJP spent 10,000 crores in bihar show the proof !!!NM was made by gujarat people not by media !!!</comment>

<comment>You are the proof.Dont digress.Ads were banned by the election commission else the results would have been worst and  a few crore more.Thank EC.Suppose BJP spent 0 rupee on the ads.25 cabinet Ministers were camping yet the truth prevailed.Justifications and denials will bolster opposition resulting in continued electoral drubbing.</comment>

<comment>Justifications and denials will bolster opposition resulting in continued electoral drubbing.</comment>

<comment>2 drubbings after winning so many elections does not mean much !!!</comment>

<comment>Dont worry, 3rd coming and then 4th. Keep counting.Those who dont  learn and are arrogant towards voters will be shown the door again and again till they improve, that is the lesson- take it or rub it in the face.</comment>

<comment>This rage is not genuine.It is the result of being neglected in the party for so long.Genuine rage could be of the cadres that worked very hard to win an election and then lost due to stupidity of few.LKA or MMJ or Sinha or Shanta Kumar are too old to influence the course of the party or the government.That is the reason why even RSS would not take them seriously.It is only the MSM that has found one more reason to criticise Modi.To that extent these "veterans" are playing in to the hands of those who are opposed to Modi,BJP and its ideology.</comment>

<comment>these so called elders can never be a threat to pm modi for the simple reason no leader in the history of the erstwhile jana sangh or bjp had such a huge deep connect and popularity with the masses not even vajpayee the  latest india today survey says that inspite of bihar loss pm modi,s persona  is as popular as it was a year ago if push  comes to shove one is sure pm modi will not only take the elders but also the rss headon like he did togadia and gang in gujrat</comment>

<comment>There is no doubt that the Modi Sahh duo has been greatly weakened by the electoral reverse in Bihar. It is only a matter of time before they are forced to buy peace with the older leaders. I feel a compromise will be reached in the form of a cabinet reshuffle where nominees of the old guard will be inducted / given more important portfolios. After passage of a decent interval of time, Shah may resign on grounds of poor health. We could then have Raj Nath Singh  as BJP President once again. Raj Nath Singh, clearly, is the man to watch.</comment>

<comment>What is a ricebowl convert?</comment>

<comment>Better word is ricebag.A ricebag is like a cockroach. A rat.</comment>

<comment>For that you need to know the story of evangelisation that happened in Orissa and you have to read Niyogi committe report of 1956.</comment>

<comment>Let me guess Christian conversion of tribals?</comment>

<comment>Thats all you can do.GUESS.Read a bit.Its good for mental health.</comment>

<comment>Do you think I can read? Considering your condescending tone I don't think you think I can. I won't surprise you, so I won't.</comment>

<comment>#facepalm</comment>

<comment>Read what you wrote. You made your assumptions. I m not trying to be rude here, you started it.</comment>

<comment>I didnt start anything.Your hyper-trivialisation of a horrific crime that happened to tribals is insensitive to such an extent that it needed an equally condescending reply.</comment>

<comment>And if its such a serious thing why are you making fun of it? One side you are judging me for being condescending and you started it. </comment>

<comment>I don't even know about it. "All you can do it GUESS". That was uncalled for.  How am I trivializing something when I don't know head or tail about it? That was my question here exactly because I was unaware about it. Whatever. Maybe you are too educated and look down at people around you who don't know something, good for you I guess. </comment>

<comment>Sorry if I was rude.</comment>

<comment>Thank you. I m sorry also if something i wrote bothered you. We good. :)</comment>

<comment>I have been asking this over a year now. Chaddis never answered. Don't take them seriously, they are good for nothing.</comment>

<comment>I am sure they are wearing their own Chaddis, but looks like yours was sold out to pay for PAPPU.</comment>

<comment>If in future someone insults me with that, I just want to know the meaning. So that I can reply in kind.</comment>

<comment>These Advanis and Vajpayees are nothing but secular windbags.Have said this all the while and will repeat it.They will bring nothing but misery for Hindus.</comment>

<comment>What are the achievements of Vajpayee??</comment>

<comment>You need to ask this to Chaddis. But, as a former PM of India, I respect Mr.Vajpayee.</comment>

<comment>you respect Vajpayee for what??</comment>

<comment>For being the PM of India.</comment>

<comment>The real cause of this crisis is not some revolts here and there and changes in the role of "cast and characters"...

<comment>Pakistan is fast gaining international importance due to weak foreign policy of Modi government.Today 20 important members of British House of Commons brought forward a resolution in the British Parliament to urge the British PM to raise the issue of Human Rights violations in Kashmir with Indian PM Modi. Obviously, Pakistan's lobbying is getting some success in comparison with India's weak policy towards Pakistan.These Parliamentarians also want the British PM to raise non-deliverance of Justice in Gujarat riots of 2002 with Mr. Modi.In the meantime, the students of Cambridge University protested against the visit of the Indian PM there. The reports state that Modi has been forced to cancel his visit to the prestigious University in view of the protests.Meanwhile, 200 writers – including Salman Rushdie, Ian McEwan and Hari Kunzru – have urged British Prime Minister David Cameron to raise issues of freedom of expression and intolerance with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi.Indian media as usual is not reporting any anti Modi event</comment>

<comment>From: Indian bharatheeyuduINTOLERANCE OF A FASCIST GOVT IN INDIAThey screamed that a church was vandalized and windows smashed. Then I came to know a bunch of school boys playing cricket had smashed the panes and fled.They cried that a church was set on fire by arsonists. Then I came to know a Christmas tree had caught fire due to short circuit.They ranted that a nun was raped and church looted. Then I came to know that 4 men from a particular community across the border were hired to intimidate the church in a land dispute; apparently no rape even took place.They yelled that 2 children were burnt to death by upper caste men in a caste conflict. Then I came to know the children were burnt to death in a fit of rage by their own father after he walked into his wife in bed with her brother-in-lawThey agonized that a man from a particular community was killed for eating beef by another community who revere the cow. Then I came to know that the cow loving man who found chopped up legs of his missing calf in his neighbor's backyard is fighting for his life in hospital after being shot by the neighbor's son during the argument and the mob lynching happened as a backlash of the firing. While they named one community's man all over to leave nobody in doubt, they didn't name the man from the cow loving community. Then I came to know the man had a surname that starts with 'Y', and wasn't named in order to protect the now legendary M-Y vote bank for Bihar elections.They said that the software czar of India is upset about growing intolerance in India. Then I came to know he has been appointed as India Head Of Ford Foundation, the CIA front NGO which has been put on a watch list by Home Min and his son had just been replaced from a top education advisory board by the Govt after a non-satisfactory IB report.They said an ageing superstar who plays college boy roles at 45, is upset about growing intolerance in India and who strangely chose to remain silent when his colleague from South faced bans on his movie in 2013. Then I came to know that the superstar has been served 2 Enforcement Directorate notices in 6 months (last one just 5 days ago) and the noose is tightening around him for money laundering in a cricket league and all his lobbying with the Govt to save his a** have been rejected.They said a world renowned sculptor has expressed disgust at growing intolerance in India. Then I came to know he was referring to France where his art was vandalized and sprayed with hate graffiti.They said a great actor who once in a movie said "when a cockroach enters my home I will have to crush it" in reference to terrorism by a certain group, has expressed concerns about growing intolerance in India. Then I came to know he said no such thing, they simply economized with the truth.A world reknowned Economist and Nobel laureate expressed concern at growing intolerance. Then I came to know that he presided over the revival of a once great ancient university of India and used the opportunity to siphon 2700 crores for a building that looks like a sophisticated toilet. The university is in Bihar but this man would sit in London and fly first class to Delhi to attend sanitized meetings in 5-star hotels with his cronies. The govt ended his party and we hear an enquiry committee is about to submit their findings.A world leading business and economics magazine from the UK expressed concern about growing intolerance in India. Then I came to know that the magazine is owned by the wife of the above Nobel laureate economist.They alarmed all over that rationalists are being killed one after another. Then I came to know all 3 rationalists were killed during rule of another govt and that law and order is always a state subject. One of them was killed after he slammed the diocese and openly invited another Indian living in exile in Finland due to fear of the diocese to return back. Oh by the way one of the rationalists 'rational' act was to regularly pee on an idol of Lord Krishna and announce to the world.An eminent historian slammed govt on growing intolerance. Then I came to know he was the eminent 'distortian' and 'hysterian' who white washed our history books for 40 years at Indian Council Of Historical Research and deprived generations after generations of young impressionable minds of their country's true history. He finds himself replaced and irrelevant today.A global sovereign debt rating agency warned India about growing intolerance, something well beyond their mandate. Then I came to know it was the back office of this sovereign rater that issued it, not the sovereign rater. It was also written by a 24-year old BA-Economics grad who's working there since 2012. He just happened to be son-in-law of the above 'eminent' historian.The central bank Governor of all people noticed the growing intolerance. Then I came to know that his father was deported from India many years ago for his links with CIA and the highly educated son is on the advisory board of Ford Foundation. I also came to know that articles dating back to May-2015 warned about Ford Foundation planning to use his services to pressure govt into rolling back the restrictions on it's activities in India.They shouted that several dozen 'noted' artists have returned their award as a snub to the government for rising intolerance. Then I came to know they didn't return either the trophy or citation or the cash.It was a fake announcement designed to stir. I also came to know that the award was given by the previous govt, so isn't returning a snub to the giver?They hoarsed endlessly that an eminent Indian writer known for exactly 1 book in 2 decades and a great philharmonic orchestra conductor are concerned about growing intolerance in India. Then I came to know both were awarded by this private news channel as 100-Indians Of The Century in a glittering ceremony which was very kindly hosted by the President Of India at Rashtrapati Bhavan.And so goes on the dance of democracy among this incestuous cabal called "intellectuals", even as India overtakes US and China in FDI for the first time, jumps 32% in brand value, achieves 1 year without a single scam and finally completes the seemingly impossible task of construction of toilets in every school and college of the country and a bank account for every adult.</comment>

<comment>The present gang of Modi + Shah + ... has brought BJP to power, which otherwise was in no position to go even close to a win even after anti congress sentiments. Now that they are faltering, the power balance within BJP needs to be corrected bit by bit. But the way seasoned veterans (all 80+) are sulking, it is simply childish and not at all done.</comment>

<comment>few bhakts are on cloud nine hearing the news of Jihadi john death India is not even called for joint strikes by anyone But modi says i have developed good friendship</comment>

<comment>(1) Shri L K Advani, M M Joshi and other partyveterans, who are no longer consulted, got a golden opportunity tocriticise both Mr. Narendra Modi and Mr. Amit Shah after the Bihar polldebacle. But apparently not many have come out in support of the old guards. (2)These party veterans would be aware that our Prime Minster and his closeconfidante party president Mr. Amit Shah have today a stranglehold on theparty. There is virtually no one in top leadership of the party to challengethe duo of Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah.  (3) Inthe context of Bihar poll debacle, it may be in interest of the party to do some serious introspection for itsfuture, and not merely because what Shri L K Advani, M M Joshi have said. (3) Perhapsnothing of that sort will ever happen. In all probability the top leadership ofthe party will simply ignore the protests of the old guards and move on.</comment>

<comment>In india politicians donot want to retire,it is true for every party.Those who get no berth in the govt and party starts to bite the party when it may seem weak,I am not telling their criticism and evaluation of the present situation is totally incorrect but as Venkaiah Naidu uttered that they should speak it within the forum of party, after all one -two state election losses do not make any big difference. Embarrassing party will not help them either instead of giving opposition some ammunitions to criticize their own party i.e. BJP.</comment>

<comment>The chinks in the armour of BJP are showing!  Indian economy is in the doldrums and the morale is down. We'll see less   of Modi's bluffing (Rs 15 lakh gift to each  Indian from the black money jackpot) and his 56 inch chest-thumping (even the great Primo Carnera had only 48 inches normal and 54 inches expansion). His 'Make India', 'Digital India', ' Skill India' are yet to take the first steps. Meanwhile, the RSS has asked him to proceed with "Divide India!" Does he have the X factor to haul the country out of the economic doldrums?   Bihar's Mahagathbandhan model is expected to spread across India.The Bihar verdict is in: The jury is out!</comment>

<comment>BJP till now created upper cast vote bank talking against reservation. Then in Bihar poll they spoke even worst than congress. They openly claimed they are never against for reservation. Why should upper cast vote them? Congress really did stick to its view. It provided reservation as per its ideology. BJP neither has ideology nor has any ethics. So lost both upper cast and lower cast vote in bihar.</comment>

<comment>That's why RSS killed Gandhi </comment>

<comment>I hope you know that your beloved Pappu made the same statement and then got sued. His only defense was freedom of expression - he couldn't provide a single document to prove RSS was involved in any way. </comment>

<comment>First of all modi should ask all media to stop the coverage of his trips non stop The coverage may be to the liking of bhakts but common man feels other way </comment>

<comment>and in india, the opposition can come up with an argument that runs like this - "the pm has spent 25 crores on his visits abroad. you could have fed 2000 hungry people with that much  money"</comment>

<comment>Fact is that people who are in BPL feel the same and they are the real voters Not we nettarati community </comment>

<comment>actually...you can never say what the common man in india feels. maybe some common people even think like : "so many times he has gone abroad, he never took any of us along" :)</comment>

<comment>it's same as telling Salman khan not to take body enhancing drugs...</comment>

<comment>One of the reasons why Barack Obama got re-elected in 2012 was the amount of negative campaigning done against him by Republicans..I am fearing Congress is just doing the same right now...</comment>

<comment>Who was the Candidate against Obama in 2012? A Mormon...No one remembers his name now...Only remember that he was a Mormon...The voters in America thought that a known moron Obama is better than a unknown Mormon</comment>

<comment>How many parties does USA have and how many in India </comment>

<comment>Ask ur momHahahahaha hahahahaha</comment>

<comment>Number of Parties don't matter...either you are pro PM Modi or Anti PM Modi...</comment>

<comment>In that case most states are anti Modi </comment>

<comment>Advani & co, Sonia and other leaders must be ready to pounce on Modi and Amith Shah  with drum beats, after B.J.P looses in opposition strongholds like Kerala, T.N, W.Bengal, Orissa, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram, Puduchery.</comment>

<comment>U continue with this bhikmangaaa statesHahahahaha</comment>

<comment>In these states BJP is not in power and has very little vote share. So what's there to lose. BJP can claim victory if its able to increase its vote share. Thats all.</comment>

<comment>i remember that in 2009 when advani was the face of the party, he did some really funny photoshoots - like pumping iron in the gym and all...if he becomes pm by some chance, it should be fun to see him do some of those.</comment>
