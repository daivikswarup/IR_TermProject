<comment>nitish ji if you wish to win bihar once again you will have to come out of alliance of r.j.d. & congress</comment>

<comment>The People of Bihar will ultimately reject Nitish Kumar even if they like him as chief minister.  He is guilty by association with corrupt goons.</comment>

<comment>If Grand alliance is a corrupt group then NDA is worst group in bihar</comment>

<comment>Now matters what survey says about grand alliance and nitish, people are definitely going to support nitish as they have seen what he has delivered but see what's happening in BJP govt in Maharashtra then how people will believe what bjp will say about Bihar and Biharis!</comment>

<comment>Yes people are not very happy about nitish grand alliance. But to avoid Gujarati attack they needed to bury their local differences. And with people like Paswan and Manjhi Bjp has not presented itself as a development seeking party. Manjhi is the only former CM from their side so in case their alliance gets majority most likely Manjhi will be CM. Those who loves Manjhi and Paswan will surely vote for them. </comment>

<comment>A good political entity worthy of being promoted to national political horizon have lost his way in midst of his long political career having been bitten by  'SECULAR BUG" and finally landed up into the lap of most corrupt,self-serving,casteist, political joker of the decade who can give run of money to comedian Kapil just to seek power in Bihar. It is really very strange to see  Nitish failing in assessing to see the rising star of the political horizon of India or he too was overshadowed by the game plan and tricks played by  the congress dynasty to curb and stop NAMO. The congressi dynasty have all the reason to hate the guts of NAMO not only  for he being an astute  politician but more for  a man of a humble background making it to the to of the political ladder. This has not gone down well with maa-beta since they have long perceived that the dynasty is born to rule this country even by proxy. It has hurt them to the innermost core of their consciousness which is reflected in their parliamentary behaviour as well as speeches made out from time to time since they tested worst defeat in 2014 parliamentary elections and other state elections.</comment>

<comment>The flower that withers away by next morning?</comment>

<comment>The author is prejudiced, it appears. Nitish may have been good in the initial term. But tell one thing, when the slate is clean, working on development and anything you do is a development. Such was the state of Bihar. He was average and his governance was certainly better than his predecessors. But over a period of time, it appeared that he lost his focus and started day-dreaming about becoming PM. The turn-around of Bihar is still a far fetched notion as many indicators are still not OK. Today Bihar is more of a consuming state than earning state though it is a resource-rich state. Where are the jobs? How do you answer that? A person at his level must be innovative and work in a multi-pronged approach, if desiring a quick turn-around. But alas, his focus was only MODI MODI & MODI. Huh!!</comment>

<comment>which other leader in bihar has these qualities and better than him?</comment>

<comment>I do not want to support any particular party. But it is time for Bihar to think that they had given enough chances to Congress and Janata Dals. Trying a new party, i.e. BJP+ sounds logical as they are at centre too. Whatever one may disagree, Modi had done a good job as a CM. Bihar must elicit something from his good experience for some betterment. Nitish is certainly in BAD company. He is making wrong moves one after the other like getting sunk into vicious circle further & further.</comment>

<comment>Bjp was ruling partner of nitish govt so they are not new to this. Now instead of nitish they have allies like Paswan and Manjhi so their level certainly has dropped. It's no more A B bajpayee BJP. It's Modi. His Monkey baat is like monkey only. Only baat-no real development. Nitish is only chance for Bihar to grow.</comment>

<comment>A PROMISE WELL KEPT - Miners to Pay 10% Royalty for Tribal WelfareThe Centre will on Wednesday notify the Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojana, which would make it mandatory for all mining companies to contribute 10%-30% of royalty for welfare of tribals and other affected persons in mining areas. The move comes within a month of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise of Rs 6,000 crore for development of tribals in mining-affected areas in his Independence Day speech.Each district where mining activity is initiated will have to set up a District Mineral Foundation (DMF) under the district magistrate or district collector. This foundation would identify people affected by mining activities and works that should be undertaken for their welfare.</comment>

<comment>Why the Bihar CM has not done any good work since BJP parted him?I think the good work was of BJP behind his mask. I think Good governance is not his cup of tea, Rather it is BJP's. So Bihar go for BJP. A hard worker loves another hard worker. why he hates Modi. Why he speaks all lies about Modi. It shows his nature. If Bihar chooses him back it will be their mistake. they will not find the same Niyish behind whom a good implementing BJP was there.</comment>

<comment>Bihar ki Janta kitni majboor hai aaj. Log Nitish ko pyar de sakte hain lekin VOTE Nahin. Sach hai burai ka sath denewale ka koi bhi saath nahin deta. Ab to NDA ko Jitana hamari majboori hai. Sirf NDA se nivedan kar sakte hain ki Biharion ke saath "Mumbai" mein badsalooki na Ho.</comment>

<comment>Last three years is what Nitish needs to be judged on.Seven years before that BJP gave him the stable majority and clean administration that comes with having a coalition partner that is not gunning for your throat every day. So for those seven years split the credit between the two partners.So for the last three years, what exactly happened in Bihar that shows Nitish as a great leader?- Mamta is able to get more for her state from center than Bihar. And that is when Mamta called Modi every abuse one can think of.- Laloo is back in the power equation. He and his sons are already spilling poison, and that is before they have gotten the deputy CM post. - Congress, which is being thrown out of every state and municipal corp in the country is a power broker in Bihar, thanks to invitation from Nitish babu- Kidnappings are back- No real development work, all energy spent in kicking out Manjhi and then playing to Kejriwal and then Rahul/SoniaThis is what arrogance does to a man - Nitish is being used by Laloo and Congress and they will spit him out soon enough and he will be the laughing stock - will join the ranks of Deve Gowda, Gujral and Chandrashekar - people who got used and discarded.</comment>

<comment>Nitish's problem is his obsession with Narendra Modi for he thought that he is a better person in terms of academic qualifiction to become the PM. What he lacked was common sense to act in a way benefitting the nation.  This has been evident in his anti modi campaigns with the sole urpose to become the PM.This is leading to his own political demise for which he cannot blame the Bihari voters.  By not voting for Nitish, the people in Bihar stand to lose only the anarchy and rudderless rule of Lalu and Congress.  Whose gain is it, it is the gain of those in Bihar.  Whose loss is it anyway ? Only Nitish's.!!!</comment>

<comment>Grand alliance broken before elction.Sp-outNCP-outLeft-outCong-? 50/50</comment>

<comment>I am sure Nitish Kumar is a good man, but he has always made wrong political choices due to his shortsighted and opportunistic tendencies.Any one with average intellect would tell you that in this country a political tie-up with someone who is convicted by the courts can be suicidal.Nitish could have taken a principled stand saying - victory or no victory, I will not tie-up with those convicted by the law of the land. I will not stand by corruption. But, he didn't.Entertaining Lalu meant disrespecting the courts, people of Bihar and India alike.</comment>

<comment>The last three words of the last line says it all "Certainly not happy tidings for Nitish after all the good work of two terms, especially the first." The first term Bihar was ruled by #Nikku in alliance with the BJP. Therefore the rule was fair and square and Bihar saw development.But soon after commencing his second term, #Nikku back-stabbed BJP suddenly wearing the secular topi. Back-stabbers and traitors are never appreciated by the public. God Willing it will be proved so in the coming two months!</comment>

<comment>AAP learned sales tricks from Modi.</comment>

<comment>With lalu, not only is nitish ship sinking but kejriwal's ship too.AAP is doomed.AAP is finished</comment>

<comment>ओवैसी किसी मुस्लिम संगठन के देन नहीं ये बीजेपी और RSS का पैदा किया हुआ शैतान हैं। जिसे साम्प्रदायिक माहौल खराब कर वोटों का ध्रुवीकरण करने का काम सौंपा गया है। बीजेपी का गेम प्लान है ये कि मुस्लिम वोटों को ओवैसी भड़काएंगे और हिन्दू वोटों को Rss, और जीत होगी बीजेपी की।महाराष्ट्र चुनाव में इसका सफल परिक्षण हो भी चुका है, जिन सीटों (लगभग 40-45) पर बीजेपी कभी नहीं जीती थी वहां ओवैसी ने अपनी पार्टी खड़ी की नतीजा ये हुआ दो सीटें ओवैसी को भी मिल गई बाकी बीजेपी जीत गई और शिव सेना को बाहर का रास्ता दिखा दिया। अब शिव सेना नाम मात्र की सपोर्ट में है।अगर ओवैसी इतने ही मुस्लिम शुभचिंतक हैं तो जम्मू कश्मीर, दिल्ली क्यों नहीं लड़े क्योंकि जम्मू में हिन्दू वोटर कम है किसे भड़काते, और दिल्ली में बीजेपी अपनी जीत मान कर चल रही थी।कुछ भी सही बीजेपी का चुनाव जितने का ये गेम प्लान उसी तरह खतरे से खाली नहीं जैसे पाकिस्तान ने आतंकवादियों को पाला तो भारत के खिलाफ था लेकिन अब उसी के लिए मुसीबत बन गया।</comment>

<comment>Vote for honest nitish do not vote for Lalu</comment>

<comment>AAP is not in Bihar that is problem </comment>

<comment>so why didnt AAP contest Bihar elections???</comment>

<comment>Only vote for AK do not vote for Lalu or Kalu or Bjp n paswan </comment>

<comment>This will be the last election for both Lalu and Nitish.Bihar had had enough of both of them.</comment>

<comment>Kris - No,  Nitish  is not bigger crooks than Shah and Modi. They are  marketing and sales crooks like Congress. AAp learned marketing lessons from BJP. the secret for modis selling his shirt is to buy out bihar for sake of Rajya sabha to get lucrative bills passed for his  corporate thugs ...it is not for sake of bihar which can live without crumbs... Corporate has promised lot more than just shirts to him.</comment>

<comment>BJP SHOULD SELECT GOOD CANDIDATES WHO ARE NOT CORRUPT, AT LEAST GRADUATE, BELOW 60 YEARS, GOOD PUBLIC IMAGE. APART FROM SELECTION OF ABLE & HONEST CANDIDATES, BJP MUST ANNOUNCE ROAD MAP TO ERADICATE RAMPANT CORRUPTION FROM STATE WHICH IS MAIN ROAD BLOCK IN DEVELOPMENT OF BIHAR. THIS WILL GIVE AN EDGE OVER OTHER PARTIES WHO LOOTED BIHAR RECKLESSLY IN PAST & PUBLIC ARE EAGER TO GET RID OF CONGRESS, RJD, JD(U) & SMALLER PARTIES LIKE LJP, MAN, RLSP, SP,CPI, CPIM), NCP etc.</comment>

<comment>See the conceitedness of these two leader., what they said today clearly depicts they have already lost their mindsLaloo : says country won't forgive who will vote for BJP.Nitish : says if Bihari don't vote for him then they are looser not me.</comment>

<comment>---the secret for modis selling his shirt is to buy out bihar for sake of Rajya sabha to get lucrative bills passed for his  corporate thugs ...it is not for sake of bihar which can live without crumbs... Corporate has promised lot more than just shirts to him.</comment>

<comment>Nitish is no saint but he is definitely a victim of a joint BJP-SP assault. This BJP is nothing like the Vajpayee BJP, It is systematically tearing down all possible opposition. Congress deserves being kicked out from India's political landscape but BJP is shutting down all others too. With Kejriwal faltering and a non-bothered Jaya, Nitish could have spearheaded the anti-BJP campaign once RSS unleashes its venom on this country. It is an open secret that Mulayam is a darling of BJP and they used him lay the bait. Of course Nitish took the bait the baggage "Lalu". Nitish-Lalu combine will sunk each other to help BJP.</comment>

<comment>as i said to Satish -- it is not for bihar Modi is BSing. Do u know why modi is aggressive in Bihar and why Manji is on bankroll. All this is done To control Rajya sabha such as to pass those lucrative bills for his corporate paymasters. Democracy cannot function when only one party take it all. Rajya sabha will have seats of same party as lok sabha and it happens when certain party wins fully like congress used to do. Congress used to pass all the bills their way. Now there is a breather because there is an opposition party that can oppose through Rajya sabha if LOK sabha has all been bought out by "ACCHE DIN" marketing like Congress "Garibi hatao" marketing. And stooges parties of bjp-congress loot cartel who offer fake opposition are no different.. BJP is trying to rule in states as well to take control of rajya sabha and very aggressive in Bihar as we speak by having manji on Bankroll. As much we support certain party. We know where all this will lead. And it could be total control of xyz party like congress used to have in name of progress and economy..</comment>

<comment>BIHAR HAS BECOME DEN OF CORRUPTION DUE TO CORRUPT & BAD GOVERNANCE BY CONGRESS, REGIONAL & SMALLER PARTIES WHO ARE DOING DESTRUCTIVE POLITICS SEALING FUTURE OF PEOPLE IN LAST 50 YEARS RULED BY CONGRESS, RJD & JD(U) WHEN NOTHING HAS IMPROVED EXCEPT POLITICS HAS BECOME ROARING BUSINESS FOR CORRUPT & DISGRUNTLED POLITICIANS TO LOOT PUBLIC MONEY. NO IMPROVEMENT & DEVELOPMENT IS POSSIBLE TILL CONGRESS, REGIONAL & SMALLER PARTIES ARE REMOVED FROM BIHAR. SO PEOPLE SHOULD BEHAVE IN RESPONSIBLE MANNER IN COMING ASSEMBLY ELECTION BY OUSTING ALL SUCH DESTRUCTIVE PARTIES RUN BY INDIVIDUAL LEADER FOR PERSONAL FIEFDOM & TO LOOT RESOURCES OF STATE RESULTED IN ACUTE POVERTY & BACKWARDNESS ALL OVER STATE. THIS FACTOR MUST BE SERIOUSLY TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BEFORE VOTING TO ABOVE PARTIES OTHERWISE PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO FACE MORE HARDSHIPS & ACUTE POVERTY IN FUTURE IF PAST HISTORY IS REPEATED TIME & AGAIN. SO PEOPLE SHOULD ONLY VOTE TO BJP WHICH IS NOT CONTROLLED BY INDIVIDUAL LEADER & HAVE INTERNAL DEMOCRACY WHICH HAS SOME CHECK ON CORRUPT PRACTICES WHICH IS NOT POSSIBLE IN INDIVIDUAL LEADER CONTROLLED CONGRESS, REGIONAL& SMALLER PARTIES LIKE CONGRESS, SP,RJD, JD(U),LJP, RLSP, MAN, NCP ETC. THE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT FORGET PAST MISDEEDS OF CONGRESS, RJD ,JD(U) IN LAST 50 YEARS OF JUNGLE RAJ. BIHAR WILL NEVER PROGRESS UNDER REGIONAL & SMALLER PARTIES'S RULE. SO IT IS FUTILE TO VOTE TO THESE SPOILER PARTIES WHOSE OBJECTIVE IS ONLY TO LOOT PUBLIC AS EVIDENT IN LAST 50 YEARS. MODI IS TRYING HIS LEVEL BEST TOWARDS  DEVELOPMENT. WHATEVER MODI HAS MADE SINCERE & HONEST EFFORTS TO SPEED UP DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IS VERY APPRECIABLE. SO PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE TO BJP FOR FASTER DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS PEACE & PROSPERITY WHICH CANNOT BE PROVIDED BY CONGRESS, RJD, JD(U) ETC. THE PEOPLE SHOULD GIVE FITTING REPLY TO CONGRESS, RJD & JD(U) FOR CORRUPT & BAD GOVERNANCE IN LAST 50 YEARS BY DEFEATING THEM IN COMING ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS. THE PEOPLE OF BIHAR MUST END JUNGLE RAJ FROM BIHAR BY DEFEATING ALLIANCE OF RJD-JD(U)-CONGRESS. BJP MUST ANNOUNCE CONCRETE PLAN TO END CORRUPTION IN BIHAR SPECIALLY WHICH IS BIGGEST HURDLE IN PROGRESS OF BIHAR SINCE PEOPLE OF BIHAR ARE WORST VICTIM OF MASSIVE CORRUPTION SINCE LAST 50 YEARS IN CONGRESS-RJD-JD(U) JUNGLE RAJ.</comment>

<comment>all those who tried to destroy NaMO are getting destroyed themselves. Just the beginning.</comment>

<comment>Negative answer to 4th question despite positive response first 3 questions shows that people trust blind faith in religion more than their brains. Otherwise both nitish and modi are guilty to colluding with corrupt like lalu and paswan.</comment>

<comment>BJP in Bihar may be VIII standard pass. But Nitish is a failed 11th standard.we have to see whether people will elect a passed candidate or a failed candidate! ah ah ah ah tell whether pass is big or failed is big!!!</comment>

<comment>if corruption is the issue for degrading lalu, then I would say feku is the most corrupt among the two.It was during lalu's time indian railway was run effectively without increasing the cost of the ticket andd no burdden on common man. now feku is planning to sell out railway to his corporate masters.</comment>

<comment>You escaped from which mental asylum? </comment>

<comment>Times of India July 26, 2014 - "The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) — the country's apex auditing agency — has slammed the Gujarat government in its five different reports, for severe mismanagement of the state's financial resources. The reports highlight irregularities amounting to more than Rs 25,000 crore, which includes what the CAG says was around Rs 1,500 crore in undue benefits to certain companies, including Reliance Petroleum, Essar Power and the Adani Group.

<comment>probably u dont understanding anything :)</comment>

<comment>You are the proof morons exist in our country.. you are typical votebank of parties like laloo and congress.. have you seen minorities? if the dad is an auto driver even his son will be a mechanic.. his grand son will remain the same.. you never want to see development.. want the cost to remain the same as per your dad's time.. you dont want to change.. you want to remain as is..</comment>

<comment>btw, why do you feel feku is non corrupt?CAG audit showed that feku did a corruption of 33000 crores scam.</comment>

<comment>ha ha don't cook up stories, if there were any scams of that size, all secular media dogs have started hounding Modi, and Sonia would have done poll dance. because that is what entire opposition is waiting for</comment>

<comment>no need to cook up fake  like feku doing with pphotoshopp.. it is CAG audit.</comment>

<comment>where is the development in feku's failed guj model.guj is one of the backward states in india.</comment>

<comment>yes true... yesterday World bank said Gujarat is number one state for ease of doing business.. and you guessed it right.. World bank is lying.. Modi bought world bank also.. its a PR stunt...</comment>

<comment>oh, the reserve bank governor is than lying. He rated guj as under developed based on some 16 parameters.</comment>

<comment>you are the proof that antinational goons come in the name of patriots.</comment>

<comment>NITISH SHOULD READ COMMENTS OF PUBLIC & APPRISE HIMSELF WHETHER HIS ALLIANCE WITH CORRUPT & GREEDY LALOO IS CORRECT. THIS IS BLUNDER DONE BY NITISH WHICH WILL END HIS POLITICAL CAREER FOREVER.</comment>

<comment>Delhi is different fromBihar.. the people wanted to give one last chance to AAP before they write off their newly born party.. But Bihar is different.. people had experienced the jungle raj of lalu for many years.. its very easy to predict the outcome.. Nobody is saying vote for BJP coz of Modi.. but everybody is saying dont vote for Nitish coz if his relationship with lalu.. Even if Modi does not campaign BJP will win.. the fools are still living in 1990's and congress era where the caste and creed mattered.. Why dont they take the example of recent LS election results where BJP scored a victory against everybody in Bihar? shameless fools.. and stupids I should say..</comment>

<comment>First of all there is a difference between people of Delhi and people of Bihar. There are more chances of BJP to win. People of Bihar want development and now they know that AAP is nothing but a failed party with failed politician.</comment>

<comment>I very well know that.. AAP is a bunch of losers..... first of all Modi's expectation was very high.. consider the moron who campaigned criticizing Modi's 9 month rule and came to power? people will hit him slap him and throw him out by the end of his 5 years.....</comment>

<comment>5 years? haha... wait for one more year and see what happens.. He will disappear from Indian politics soon....</comment>

<comment>It is known issue - Nitish will suffer for his friendship with Goonda Lalu...</comment>

<comment>Lalu irritates when he speaks, how ppl of bihar elected him for 15 years is a mystery same as ppl of delhi elected anarchist arvind</comment>

<comment>Have you seen development in the last 10 years? The answer is yes, and thank you BJP and Sushil Modi (ex-Deputy CM Bihar) for helping in the development agenda of the state govt. Now that Nitish Kumar broke ties with the BJP in 2014, a genuine question to ask in the survey would have been "would you like to see Nitish Kumar or Sushil Modi as next Bihar CM?"</comment>

<comment>Nitish may not have been the Super CM but he was by far the best. There is indeed a "ring of Honesty and Sincerity" around the man. Call it image management or whatever. However honesty and sincerity is not enough for success in politics. He made absolutely foolish decisions : 1. To get of of NDA citing Secularism 2. Joined hands with that devil called LALU. Game over.</comment>

<comment>You are right. But is it not naive to say what you or me can understand, Nitish could not see the pitfall of joining Lalu? Ofcourse he knew. The real question is could he do anything else? I think no. The ground was swelling for BJP, and fractured non BJP would have been bigger disaster. Actyually by joining with Lalu, Nitish has accepted defeat.</comment>

<comment>It is  the difficult situations which demand the true test of the character of a leader. I think instead of looking at the short term gains (so he thought) and tying up with a spent force like Lalu, he should have gone for long term vision. If it meant losing current elections ..well let that be so!</comment>

<comment>Paswan did the same during advani's time but he is ready to jump from party to party as per his convinience.</comment>

<comment>Paswan is too small a fry to be compared with Nitish!</comment>

<comment>BJP is entering into alliance with LJP, RLSP, HAM party which are smaller party run by individual leader like Paswan, Kushwaha, Manjhi for fiefdom & dynasty politics. These leaders are permanent headache for BJP who will ask for creamy portfolios later on to amass wealth as happened with Paswan & Manjhi who enjoyed power & amassed huge wealth by abusing power in past. So BJP should keep distance from these greedy & corrupt parties. BJP should announce immediately strongest measures to eradicate corruption from Bihar which is continuing since last 50 years ruled by Congress under corrupt Jaganath Mishra, RJD under Laloo & JD(U) under Nitish. There is urgent need of Strong Lok Ayukta bill on pattern of Uttrakhand proposed by the then BJP CM Khanduri to nail corrupt & incapable alliance partners as well as corrupt BJP ministers if indulged in corrupt practices. Bihar could not progress unless corruption is totally curbed in state. The public are worst sufferer of massive corruption promoted by Congress, RJD & JD(U) in past 50 years. The people should not repeat past blunder of 50 years by electing three parties i.e. Congress, RJD & JD(U) and smaller parties who are not capable of giving good & honest governance resulted in repeating past Jungle Raj of 50 years. BJP SHOULD TAKE ACTION AGAINST REBEL PARTIES AFTER ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS BECAUSE THESE PARTIES WILL CREATE PROBLEMS EVEN AFTER ELECTIONS.</comment>

<comment>dear friends as i had mentioned earlier as the election date approaches we will be seeing more and more of such useless articles glorifying sickular kumars imaginary popularity among biharis the sickular media  is working overtime to promote sickular  kumar  this man along with his bandit partner chara chor yadav  are 2 people primarily responsible for destroying the dreams of lakhs of young biharis the past more than 35 yrs</comment>

<comment>Read the article again. It ACTUALLY denounces Nitish Kumar in spite of having done a good job for last ten years. It is doing just THE OPPOSITE of what you are saying.</comment>

<comment>Why did Nitish choose Lalu over Modi. ? Does not make sense (since the communal angle which was hes reason for quitting the BJP alliance appiles to RJD as well)</comment>

<comment>I have seen only JP Narayan from Andhra as honest politician with moral values, all others are boneless creatures and it includes kejrival as well. The tragedy of our country is that even if your are honest you can not win because of your marginal presence at limited place. Even though i know JP as a good candidate in Andhra I will not vote for him in Lok Sabha election as his chances to win are none.</comment>

<comment>In my study of world history its the cunning, smart ,ruthless, efficient that have always won.The important thing for me that the leader/Gov should have India's concern before party/self</comment>

<comment>Whether janta parivar wins or loose, NItish definitely gonna lose his power.</comment>

<comment>Good work mate</comment>

<comment>ha ha</comment>

<comment>First, why would you want to believe that people answered question 3 in a manner favorable to Nitish??Actually, people said that Nitish Kumar when heading the government in coalition with BJP was able to make these development possible and without the BJP he may not have done so.JDU volunteers edited the response!  😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😀</comment>

<comment>Where is kejriwal in the mahagatbandhan equation?Oh he ran away? Again?Is that why people call him obsessive compulsive bhagoda?</comment>

<comment>Sir, Kejriwalbhai has asked us to represent him on this forum. He is in namaz right now will be back shortly.</comment>

<comment>BJP seems to be gaining strength and may make a big comeback this time.</comment>

<comment>No question of "comeback". they have always maintained their winning streak since December 2013 (MP, Raj elections). Delhi was just a small speed bump in the ride. That is all.</comment>

<comment>Ladnay say pehlay harnay walay ko Nitish kumar kehtay hain..</comment>

<comment>What is drastic fall is not explained... Is it 50%... Let them do a one more survey with fifth question: Which Jumla of Modi has travelled from mouth to ground?</comment>

<comment>Thank you Iqbal for supporting AAP agenda in every forum. It is namaz time now so please face west to Islamabad and start namaz now. After that, you can have your pork sandwich in AAP HQ Kitchen.AAP Social Media</comment>

<comment>lol</comment>

<comment>Jumla or no Jumla. Save Bihar defeat laloo. This should be the only aim for every Bihari.</comment>

<comment>Ok. So what's the survey result? Seems like Author is privy to the survey result. Why not publish the fourth number as well like in 40s, 30s or 20s..The writer gave away all the positive numbers but didn't even gave a hint on the negative number.</comment>

<comment>Who in hell can like Father of ISHRAT JAHAN,BACKSTABBING OPPORTUNIST, can do anything for his VOTE BANKIn my view HE IS MUCH WORSE THAN LALOOPeople like him can make 100 LALOO FOR THEIR OWN GOOD.</comment>

<comment>Nitish is the biggest loser here. He broke away from bjp to hurt bjp after they didn't select him for pm candidate. He wanted to show his worth but instead voters showed him his worth, which was very little without bjp as an ally. He can't even campaign much. What is he going to say. I did good work while i was partnered with bjp</comment>

<comment>If you are looking for fun.. Go to facebook.. search for mark zuckerberg open up the post where he has invited Modi to FB HQ and read the comments....... You will die laughing.....</comment>

<comment>I do not have a Facebook account... Please copy paste so all can laugh...</comment>

<comment>Only AAPtards have that talent.No one else can spam "copy paste" non stop</comment>

<comment>Nitish is no match for Modi and his wiles and guiles. Earlier Nitish had to contend with Modi as a CM. Now Modi is a PM , a much bigger ball game altogether. And the one big mistake committed by Nitish was to tie up that slimeball Laloo who is nobody's favourite.At best he is a buffoon, dispensing comic relief to saddened souls. If by any chance the Nitish Gathbandhan does even come to power ( the chances are remote), he will have Laloo breathing down his neck as never before. Even if he becomes the CM , do you for even a moment  think that Laloo will let him work ? He will unleash his goonies Syed Shahabuddin et al on Bihar and its hapless folk. Bihar's salvation lies with BJP and BJP only. The state sends its largest quota of bureaucrats to the country. But the people dont seem to apply their mind when it comes to choosing the right people to head their state. Woe on it !</comment>

<comment>There starts the media distortions.1. "Percentage fell drastically" ..please tell us the percentage. We will decide if it is drastic or not!2. Cicero poll is cited what about the  C-Voter poll?3. One student giving an answer to Laloo's question in a studio has given concrete proof that caste doesn't matter in India. Research material that the author of this FP article considers pure gold!Certainly not happy tidings for people who believe in the fairness and sensibilities of the media!</comment>

<comment>desperado Nitish trying to hold on to just about anybody anti-modi - Jhadoo to Laloo ;-)</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Survey design is by Prashant Kishor.But regardless of whether or not you ask the question - "Will you choose Nitish again" in the survey, people would have made that decision in their minds. If now now, then atleast before going to to the polling booth. So asking that question in the survey is not a bad move. At some point down the line, people will ask that question to themselves.</comment>

<comment>Nitish has put a dead snake around his neck. He will rue it at leisure.</comment>
