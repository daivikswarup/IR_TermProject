<comment>PM Modi for heavens sake dont get trapped by Gandhian Ideology. MK Gandhi sold is suppporters, Hindus to buy the support of Jinnah and muslims. Spill blood if required as Mahabharata advice. Vice keeps on growing with peace.Emergency was single party dictatorship inevitable and essential to socialism. Congress was socialist. CPI supported emergency.Leftists followi the communist politburos which have the aim to establish their single party dictatorship. Socialism has to have ultimately single party dictatorship. As George Orwell puts it:" One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safe guard a revolution, One does a revolution in order to establish a dictatorship".In India since a single party dictatorship is not possible over entire India - they have to take recourse to dictatorships over FRAGMENTS of India - hence support to secessionism.=========================================With free gun laws + capitalism society will not be VULNERABLE and all kinds of free speech can be allowed for INDIVIDUALS.It is well known that ISI/ ISIS target Brahmins. As India is a Ocholocrcy[mob rule, where Individual rights are secondary and frequently murdered], for the short term, immediately Brahmins need protection. With free gun laws + Capitalism constitution changes to INDIVIDUAL centric and former Brahmins[present dalits] will not need special protection.Constitution of India should be INDIVIDUAL centered [free gun laws of USA is example]. Else we have seen the result - democracy has degenerated ito Ocholocracy[mob rule]. Constitution of India is group centred.</comment>

<comment>Secular Sources say that Dadri killing of Akhlaq was by his muslim neighbour only due to personal enemity between the two. That is why both his family and the Samajwadi Party and Azam khan shied away from CBI Probe ! But pre$$titutes like burkha dutt, and bhupendra chaubey ilks distorted and diverted the news to project muslims as victims always !</comment>

<comment>Story of a dangerous jihadi brahman who was expelled out of India ! How dangerous a jihadi brahman can be ? Very dangerous indeed !If we go back in history, K@@ba stone in Mecca was a Shivling. The whole of Asia was the empire of Raja Vikramaditya . He established Kaapaleshwar Shivling in Mecca to civilize the barbarians and instill dharma and also Mecca was center point of the earth. After Conquering the entire Asia, Vikramaditya established the Vijaya Stambh also known as Vishnu Stambh and now known as Qutub Minar was originally a 11 storey building and used by Varahamihiracharya as an astronomical observatory and a museum. Taj Mahal was Tejo Mahalaya the Shiv Mandir built by the Rajput kings. You can find Numerous Shiv lings throughout Asia. The Ancient story says that Muh@mm@d the Prophet was a Sama Vedi Brahman expelled out of India because he f^cked his own daughter. Filled with rage and hatred, Muh@mmed vowed to start a religion that is completely inverse of Hinduism about 2000 years back. In Islam there is no concept of love, only r@pe and multiply and expand your religion. As Mark Twain says, Hinduism is the mother of all religions is very much true.!</comment>

<comment>It's a real wonder that Ms Irani decries this an an insult and threat to Mother India. Isn't the plunder of the resources of the land, the displacement of people to make way for dams and the courting of the very worst of western culture the real insult?</comment>

<comment>Such divisive forces like RSS has risen in different part of India many times and  could not succeed.RSS is big challenge to idea of India but I am sure Indian will beat them, though some scar will be visible for decades to come.</comment>

<comment>You are a joke, RSS is not a foreign element, it's people force, it's going from good to better, strong to stronger</comment>

<comment>This forum is the best example of the wave of intolerance, vicious venom, fascism and cynical hatred perpetrated by the Sanghi  sympathisers who are insolent, delude that every thing is black and white and unable to tolerate alternative opinion nor the patience to constructively debate with intellectual strength !!Moderator has to  to kindly take note of their insidious and wh1msical  way of targeting columnists who become their  punch bag and are castigated in the most denigrating fashion when  they write columns unpalatable to the narrow and biased view point of these douche bags !!The way our future generation  is being shaped up by the  Shakha mindset of the Sangh in the name of cultural rejunevation  is fraught with grave consequences for communal harmony and social fabric of this multi lingual, multi cultural, multi ethnic, muti religious Nation which is a sub continent by itself in terms of its extreme diversity and can never confluence  nor integrate with the Sanghi preamble of "One Nation, one Culture and one Religion" !!</comment>

<comment>My way or high way.either do as what we tell you or pack your bags</comment>

<comment>You are pests to me which I will trample upon the floor !! Ha ha ha !!How many years I have been in this forum with all yr insinuations and intimidation. I know how to deal with lumpen elements and rogues of yr kind.  I will be dignified to those who deserve it and treat cockroaches of yr kind with sheer contempt.

<comment>hahah!!No Chaddi swine...you are barking  for so many years ....what have you achievedMuslims were butchered in Gujarat like stray dogs and then Modiji was made PMwhat u could do ..nothing except barkinggo on keep barking</comment>

<comment>New age Hindu nationalism is nothing but a reaction to corrupt, perverted, pseudo secular, closet Islamist Indian left... most so called internet Hindus are actually normal people frustrated by hypocrisy and minority(read muslim)  appeasement of the left... so far people like you had a free ride in many government run institutions where you shamelessly enjoyed subsidized luxury at the expense of tax payer's money and probably hoped it to last forever... now that you are being paid back in our own coins, you are running scared to some invisible "moderator of the forum"... serves you right</comment>

<comment>Bull sh1t !!!!!</comment>

<comment>this article reads like ideology of fossilised left and secularists ideas. lot of the panelists in the media ,let it be times now or ndtv or cnn ibn have similar sentiments.now india cannot  be  forced to accept one ideolog with a vast young population to challenge it. it is time for the leftist and secularists to realise this.</comment>

<comment>The Sangh  Parivar and its associated  fringe outfits are the scourge of this Nation and must be exterminated lock, stock and barrel if this Nation is to survive and thrive !!</comment>

<comment>keep dreaming, RSS does not care about dogs like you from 5 to 5million in 90 years and growing stronger...thats RSS</comment>

<comment>yeah then u sickular islamic porkis can start jung against india in the name of Jihad or whatever u like......</comment>

<comment>If BJP fails to eliminate Antinationals from Central universities now it wont get another chance and the Nation has to live with anarchists occupying Central universities and getting fatter by eating scholarships .</comment>

<comment>RSS is the best organisation any patriotic Indian can dream of joining. Discipline, action and devotion to the nation with actual work on the ground is one of the most satisfying things being in the RSS. Some old schoolers in the group which might not go well with urban kids but that will change culturally as the membership gets younger.</comment>

<comment>The campuses were the fortresses of antinational commies for 65 years. Why should the RSS or BJP not challenge that?!</comment>

<comment>If the bunch of eunuchs in the Media do nothing about these termite not only eating government money but also destroying the ethos of the Universities, the ABVP will continue to grow stronger. Students who earlier were just focused on getting a degree and getting out, are now sparing some time to fight these anti national Afzal followers.</comment>

<comment>congress agent. Ajay Singh never said anything about the anti national statements and protests of the JNU students and their slogans supporting independent Kashmir. When will Indian journalists become professional and report the news with proper analysis, instead of showing their bias and thus proving that they deserve to be called "prestitutes".</comment>

<comment>RSS should meet all other Hindu Organizations and even Shankrachrya & Unite and fight against the enemy of Nation and Hindus.</comment>

<comment>ITS good INDIA has RSS which do every thing in NAtional Interest, they may be whatever ,  but not anti national</comment>

<comment>Learn, educate your self friend. History tells us RSS sold the country to Britishers when the nation was fighting for freedom. Anything but national.</comment>

<comment>yeah Mr Harishchandra</comment>

<comment>FP pl do not raise non sensical bogey. When a criminal was hanged as per judgement of top court, how these anti nationals talk against it? In any most other countries they would have been shot dead.</comment>

<comment>Anti national are selected to be hanged on religious line. Nobody in RSS talks about sikh terrorists on death row , should they not be hanged.</comment>

<comment>I guess Ajay Singh doesn't understand the derivation of "news" (it isn't north-east-west-south as some imagine), given that he posts such non-news articles as this.</comment>

<comment>better late than never. RSS should have moved in long back before all these  antinational seditionists and their supporters like this author of this completely biased article based on his personal prejudices had got a strong foothold in subverting this nation.TV 18 should not give platform to such outrightly biased writers to publish such propaganda material</comment>

<comment>How do you carry out conversion attempts in India?Father Johnson -You see the local people are so simple and naïve that they do not have any clue as what out motive or means are. We target mostly the poor, illiterate, tribal people because they are the easiest to convert. We do that by various means – we establish schools, hospitals that overtly or subtly promote our faith, we allure them with money or goods to the needy when they convert, we "stage’ miracle cures, we use our influence on the media, we use our experts in propaganda, we promote the influential people and so on. We use the money sent to us by unsuspecting religious and faithful Christians from all over the world. We have numerous NGO and AID organizations to funnel the money into the country. There are a great number of missionaries of various denominations who are working there, all literally competing for the most number of converts. The Southern Baptists alone are a group that has nearly 100,000 career missionaries in North India, all working to spread our "good word."We convince the "natives’ by our appearances and even use their own culture. A native converted person will continue to use his Hindu name so as not to alienate himself. Some of the numerous Catholic priests in Southern India dress like "sannyasis’ (monks), and call their organizations "ashramas’ (hermitage). This is to make Christianity more similar to the Vedic traditions. Bharat Natyam, the classical dance of India, is also taught in the Christian schools, but with Christian symbols and meanings replacing the Vedic. This is all in the attempt to actively sway Hindus over to Christianity. The Evangelical Church of India (ECI), established in 1954, targets the slums, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, in cities and villages. Its logo depicts a cross struck deep in a lotus, the seat of Hindu divinity.</comment>

<comment>Why do you target India?Father johnson -India is the right country because Hindu Indians are generally peace-loving tolerant, law abiding people who are truthful and virtuous. India"s devotion to being good rather than being clever comes nearer the heart of a true civilization, said W. J. Grant, in his book, "The spirit of India’. The unsuspecting Indians have always welcomed everybody on their shore and still keep on doing so. You cannot say the same about a Muslim country or of communist China. You see Hindus are such naive – they go out of their way to say that "all religions are same – they all lead to God’. Christians and for that matter, no other religion, says that.</comment>

<comment>What about Hinduism as a religion?Father johnson -Hinduism has a deep philosophical and spiritual heritage that has repeatedly mesmerized the world including western scientists, leaders and philosophers. Despite propaganda to the contrary, Hindus, like us, believes in one Supreme God but they do so in many forms, that helps to develop personalized relations. Hinduism is the oldest major religion in the earth with 900 million followers. Unlike monotheistic institutionalized, religions like Judaism, Islam or Christianity, it is not based on any single prophet or scripture, but allows its followers all the freedom to pursue God and Truth in their own way, while living harmoniously with all creation.We know that the Hindus are tolerant of other religions. Recently, UNESCO pointed out that out of 128 countries where Jews lived before Israel was created, only one, India, did not persecute them and allowed them to prosper and practice Judaism in peace. Similarly the Zoroastrians, when driven out of Persia by Islam were given shelter by the Hindus in India and still coexist in India peacefully. Very recently, the Dalai Lama, driven from Buddhist Tibet, has been accepted with open arms. Such is the ethos of Hinduism and India.I have heard that Mark Twain once said that "In religion all other countries are paupers; India is the only millionaire’. I have also read Arnold Toynbee’s writing "…at the religious level, India has not been a recipient; she has been a giver. About half the total number of the living, higher religions are of Indian origin’. What do you think about it?We know India gave birth to religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism. Hinduism, though the predominant religion, has, to quote Aldous Huxley, "never been a persecuting faith, have preached almost no holy wars and have refrained from that proselytizing religious imperialism which has gone hand in hand with political and economic oppression of colored people.’What many do not know and I will not elaborate further for obvious reasons, is that there are researchers who think that the teachings of Jesus Christ have something to do with the ancient wisdom of Vedas. The Hindu concepts of "karma’, and "reincarnation’, which are part of the New Age Movement that we see today, were not unknown to Jesus and his teachings has its roots in India !</comment>

<comment>Chamcha Nehru referred to Subhash Chandra Bose as "War Criminal". This is the result of degenerated secularism of Najayaz aulads ! On the other hand RSS has been credited by international agencies as the largest NGO in the world which is striving hard to implement and sustain the ideals of Swami Vivekananda - the fiery monk of India !</comment>

<comment>I am Gujarati but I always have disappointment with Gandhi since he is the one who made many mistakes being so liberal and entire India has been paying for all his mistakes.</comment>

<comment>Sister Nirmala Joshi was also a victim of sexual harassment by the fathers and clergy men after she converted thinking that she will reach heaven after converting. Sexual harassment is nothing new in the west and happens as a daily routine, remember ? the POPE had apologized for unspeakable crimes against women and Children by the Church across the globe. For Isl@m and chirsti@nity women is a child producing machine to expand their headcount and satisfy their holy lust ! Most shocking is in Tamil Nadu and Kerala churches, during weekend prayers there will be small groups of children playing and if you ask them '' who is your father", don't be surprised if they say the church father \ archibishop is my real father and the nun is my mother ! These so called unmarried Vatican goons who preach celibacy to others are running several illegal families and have fathered several illegitimate children ! Nothing gets reported as a large section of the media is fed and controlled by the Vatican....</comment>

<comment>Who destroyed the v!rginity of v!rgin Mary ? the same evangelical barbarians made her a b!tch, Jesus became a saint seeing the pain of his mother and to civilize the barbarians !The successor of Jesus was his wife. But barbarians like - the evangelist Church, killed her for the lust of Power. In the name of Jesus, the successors of the Pope have committed genocide of women because Jesus wanted women popes. Christianity has a bloody, horrendous history which the current pedophile r@pist fathers hide and which no Christian like me would love to know ! Refer Da vinci code for more details !</comment>

<comment>You should be ashamed of yourself. Just try reading what you've written and why don't you ask the parents that raised you to read it as well! I cant imagine they'd be proud to have brought up one like you.</comment>

<comment>So what is wrong with it. It is the only nationalistic grouping that has to face off against the anti-national, jihadist Scamgress, the China-paid-CPI/CPI(M), and the ISI-paid AAP. In fact, for the sake of this nation, ABVP must move aggressively into the campuses to counter these anti-national and uproot them.</comment>

<comment>The ISIS is brain washing m^slims telling them that if you fight for your religion, @llah will be happy and when you die and goto heaven, 72 virgins will be waiting in heaven to be f^cked by you. Wait a minute, while you have buried the body of terrorists on earth, how the hell can he r@pe the virgins in heaven ? The tool used by them to fu-k 'the holy L-_nd' would be dead and buried in Kabristan. Then can any one tell me how the poor chap can fu--k ?</comment>

<comment>Dear Indian seculars and liberals,Its the need of the hour to practice real secularism....All types of communalism and extremism is detrimental for the country be it Sanghi goons or SIMI/IMTo maintain your credibility, be neutralIf you cannot condemn anti-national acts, at least don't condemn the actions taken against it..No one is asking for your certificates.You people don't have that credibility.A PROUD INDIAN MUSLIM</comment>

<comment>Secular Sources say that Dadri killing of Akhlaq was by his muslim neighbour only due to personal enemity between the two.

But pre$$titutes like burkha dutt, and bhupendra chaubey ilks distorted and diverted the news to project muslims as victims always !</comment>

<comment>You mean Campuses where ANTI INDIA slogan have been raised . right????</comment>

<comment>What an irony that those who never had their footprint in the freedom struggle are the vanguards of patriotism today in this Country ?  The history of RSS during the freedom struggle is one of betrayal, treachery where they were siding the colonizers by ridiculing the then freedom fighters and their contribution to this Nation !!Name one RSS freedom fighter of eminence and  significance ? All they can quote is Savarkar who was in the Hindu Mahasabha and its animosity with the Sangh is well known !!The RSS infact never hoisted the National flag in their Nagpur HQs and it is only recently that they are fiddling with such an arrangement to fool this Nation on patriotism !!</comment>

<comment>Such half baked stuff.</comment>

<comment>Yeah !! You are right.  I should have heated it more adding more spice !!</comment>

<comment>RSS is a Hindu separatist just like LET is Islamic separatist. Neither of them want to let people live peacefully.</comment>

<comment>One of them frequently uses bombs to blow sh!t up all around!! Maybe u shud try too!!!</comment>

<comment>When a mulla terrorist tries to substantiate Indian freedom struggle to cover his jihadist activity... thats a blog op there!!! hehehe</comment>

<comment>Are you that incestuous pest, dirty imposter and shameless wimp  named Space Ocean ??</comment>

<comment>Communists have a vision that is not constrained by national boundaries.  It relates to a universal vision &  takes the constraint posed by nations as an irritant.  Obviously, they have no time for any nationalistic feeling.  The Indian communists  had coined "Yeh azadi jhoota hai'  in 1950's,   split in to two after USSR & China split ideologically in 1959, some of them raised funds for China in 1962 war,   called "China's president  our president"  during naxal movement.In their fight against 'Colonialism' , they find Islam as a great friend. Islam, when enters a new land, tries to destroy all signs of past glory and erases history.   So do communists.  They try to distort history and want to make people self-loathing ones.When INC split into two in 1969,  Left supported Indira Gandhi.  In return, she put a self-proclaimed Leftist Prof Nurul Hasan as Education Minister (1971-77).   Since then, Leftist control over Educational Institutes began.  Faculties were chosen accordingly in many such institutes. The Leftist influence runs deep in our intellectual realm.Now when Congress is no more in centre,  the Left may not get extra support they were getting earlier.   Obviously,  other factions will move into these areas.   Nature never likes a vacuum.   And yes, there will be some clashes .... nobody likes to give up what he/she enjoyed for so many years.The  student politics will remain interesting to watch for next two years.   After that, everything will settle down.</comment>

<comment>When antinationals sprinmg up patriots must keepmum.Is that what is needed.Dont patronise antinationalism whether it is one campus or other.Dont  put blame on the nationals.We want to live here peacefully with out fear.</comment>

<comment>..........OR "Uproar over Afzal at JNU and Yakub at Hyderabad indicate just one thing: Islamic terrorist is moving into campuses!!</comment>

<comment>Or may be it means that it is getting reported NOW.</comment>

<comment>Why is there a new image about this article unlike the others for the links? Also while FP has a column for the anti nationals being questioned under "Rohith Vemula" or the "Beef controversy" why does it not persist in reporting the opium fields of Malda or the killings there? Not secular is it? Shame on you FP</comment>

<comment>What is FP or its owners intent in running down the RSS and portraying the outrage as RSS acts - it is from all right thinking people.</comment>

<comment>Come whatever may, some people'll always try to find a way to implicate RSS/BJP/Rightists in events and issues which are as crystal clear as water. Their mental compass'll point only in one direction, and with that biased view, they'll interpret the world around. No one can help them, for it would have required the focus of a microbiologist, discipline of a nuclear physicist and perseverance of a research scholar to train their minds to remain blinded and shut from the reality. We can only wish them good luck and pray that they get well soon. My only humble request to those gentlemen and women is please choose profession other than journalism though it is the easiest to get entry into, for here you spread your polluted world-view, nefarious thoughts and negativities to the world across, and that is not good for the society.</comment>

<comment>this is what has happened in the last 60 years. Majority of journalists are from leftist background as they are never good at studies</comment>

<comment>so what , we are fed up of the leftist ideologies and sickularism , which could not provide lets say toilets to 60 % of populace . school books - hail tipu as a great sickular leader who fought the british ( lol ) his father forcefully usurped what was not his andtipu  later converted a majority of those into muslims in mallapuram/ wynad  (, kodavas , kasargod , and malabar too ) , he is fcking AH and these are taught to children</comment>

<comment>Rumour Spreading Society (RSS) motto is to "Catch them young" to  indoctrinate with false glory, pride, achievements, traditions by distorting history,  vitiating Science and circumventing Geography !!</comment>

<comment>ISIS model of recruitment is also the same.</comment>

<comment>who;s distorted history katua rationalist . u guys </comment>

<comment>Are Ramayana and Mahabharata history or mythology ??</comment>

<comment>Tipu sent a letter on 19 January 1790 to the Governor of Bekal (near Kasaragod), Budruz Zuman Khan. It says:"Don't you know I have achieved a great victory recently in Malabar and over four lakh Hindus were converted to Islam? I am determined to march against that cursed Raman Nair (Rajah of Travancore) very soon. Since I am overjoyed at the prospect of converting him and his subjects to Islam, I have happily abandoned the idea of going back to Srirangapatanam now."[48]that shows what u katuas did to Indian history , all thiose malabari muslim chutes are the byproducts of rampant rapes by Tipus hordes , may be ur fore mother might be one of them and look  at school books , which glorifies a muslim chute</comment>

<comment>Was this Tipu's letter printed in Panchanjanya ??</comment>

<comment>not at all mate by vaticano led wikipedia , u should have known that panchajanya is a nationalist paper , will not not bother about anti national 's letter , in fact is more of a tissue paper for unatioanlists  , i brought it out to show how rational the rationalists  were and who distorted history</comment>

<comment>Haha</comment>

<comment>well was koran told by a god to a man or did a pedo write it</comment>

<comment>See again a typical Chaddi diversion !!</comment>

<comment>not at all just a retort for ur diversion on my note about distortion of history</comment>

<comment>Glorifying terrorists is the right way to go</comment>

<comment>Ask your Subramaniam Swamy as to why he expanded RSS as "Rumour Spreading Society". He is with you today. Why not seek a clarification from that blackguard ??</comment>

<comment>well the rumours he is spreading is bring down the faithful sickulars ,  keep going swamy u always rock</comment>

<comment>So, the buffoon has become a hero to you.  Mark this, it will not be long when he rocks yr boat and join the sickular camp yet again !!Chaddi Morons    - Where are really yr brains ?</comment>

<comment>lol ,ask your mama maino , who has a live time bomb under her ** , thanks to the nationalist swamy , anyway thanks for accepting a that sickularism exists . now where is yours( brain ) in your AH or washed down the drain</comment>

<comment>It means only means one thing. Traitors who have had a free run are now being exposed.</comment>

<comment>Indian Media : LeftistIndia Peoples : Nationalist</comment>

<comment>so author suggests no kind of watch is allowed on ANTI-NATIONALS. And it is against democracy!</comment>

<comment>If RSS is moving into campuses, it better move in!  To stop anti-nationals, Islamic terrorists and criminals who are settling down in campuses.</comment>

<comment>Hope they can check anti national activities ta campuses. Event at JNU will make any Indian hang his head in shame.</comment>

<comment>It's not RSS that is getting into universities.  It is Islamic fanatics, Congress sympathisers, anti-nationalism and terrorists that are getting into universities.  And people protest against it - and media (like FP) is pulling in the RSS name into the picture to create sympathy for these terrorists and anti-nationals.</comment>

<comment>Nehru and Edwina courted relationship to give birth to Pakistan. Then Indira conspired to hand over North east region to Bangladesh and china, and Jk to Pakistan. Congress under Italian Sonia/Pappu turned into a huge termite eating away at the innards of MotherIndia . What we see at the Jnu / Ftii are the new worms coming out of the mother termite body to eat away at the very founding roots of this great nation to deal it a death blow. Communists like Yechury/ BrindaKarat are tools of the congress in this. But hold on, India has Modi and Hanumanthappas (not unlike Krishna and Arjun)  to defend it. </comment>

<comment>Why cann't government ban FP</comment>

<comment>Ajay Singhji...are you sure you are in the right profession?...Your writings dont show that...neither does your intellect.Its not about the dissent on thoughts....We all can disagree and thats fine...but your writings lack the finesse....your thoughts lack attention to detail on a story or a piece...You cant conveniently pick "facts" which suit you..and discard others when trying to put in something....Or you do it so that you get more comments and maybe more money...I dont know...But if the later is true then...then they have a name for such presstitutes.....If the former is true...then you shouldnt even be here....</comment>

<comment>So what ? Isn't this India, the only homeland to Hindus ? So, First Post, when you start singing verses praising anti-nationals and terrorists in places of learning, while Hanumanthappas of the nation lay down their lives, you are certainly going to face Rss, Abvp, Bajrangdal, Vhp and other nationalist orgs. Don't expect red carpet into India from Pakistan border.</comment>

<comment>Rabid antinationals!!! They are pests to the growth and development of a society. I see a lot of these in these forums.... conveniently call themselves AAPTARDS!!!</comment>

<comment>At least the writer accepted that so far the universities have been controlled by commies congress coolies. But things are changing. Fresh ideas and thoughts will come and whoever wants to imbibe them can do so without fear. Let there be no inbreeding of thought process.</comment>

<comment>well said...</comment>

<comment>ha ha ha !!  If somebody attacks the Congress and Commies, this Moron gets orgasm !!</comment>

<comment>not as much as you get being a desh drohi ....</comment>

<comment>Not a piece of news at all -- no surprise RSS "pilfered fire" from the evils (islam, communism) it portrays itself as being a "necessary evil" to block (somewhat like "grey magic" blocking "black magic")!</comment>

<comment>Good that you atleast accepted that the Sangh Parivar is an evil !!</comment>

<comment>Not "accepted" -- it is shown beyond doubt in Deuteronomy (get yourself a Bible if you don't have one and read entire 36-chapters book; and while at it, see also Revelation 13, which describes Islam almost-to-a-t -- only detail not duplicated by that cult is irreversibility of beastmark).</comment>

<comment>As I told you I reiterate once again that I am very happy  that you atleast accepted that Sangh Parivar is an evil !!</comment>

<comment>Necessary evil!!! </comment>

<comment>An evil nevertheless !!  Necessary, may be for you !!</comment>

<comment>Hmmm.... when u irradicate pests in a society,it becomes evil the very moment. Its legitimate when courts does, it's necessary when politics get into it!!!</comment>

<comment>Clumsy Twats need no explanation !!</comment>

<comment>Hence I rest my case!!!</comment>

<comment>It is better you take a rest instead of commenting in such forums and vitiate it with your scum layered filth !!</comment>

<comment>Look who is talking!!! Filth, scum, vitiate, slime, lunatic.... do you realize these are synonyms used to describe a herd of swines called terrorists and their supporters!!!! I was actually just responding to one..... hmmm!!</comment>

<comment>You Chaddi Morons deserve this language as you are the provocateurs !!  There is a reason you are personification of intolerance because you do not have the ability to debate coherently  due to your intellectual bankruptcy !!</comment>

<comment>Hehhe....If I open my mouth... u will probably die of flushing ur head in ur commode!! Well, i do not want to stoop to ur level yet!! And look who was running away from a debate all this while!!! Its the terrorist sympathizer I guess!!! The embodiments and personifications of tolerance!!! hehehe</comment>

<comment>What ? You have still not opened your stinking mouth ? Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha !!What can one expect from Chaddi Morons like you except farting around with f1lth !?</comment>

<comment>Oops!!! U laugh stinks horrible than my fart on U!! Lolzzz!!!</comment>

<comment>I want to vomit on your face so that you can tongue it as a delicacy !!</comment>

<comment>U can only vomit if u take tht d!ck out off ur mouth!!! Hehehe</comment>

<comment>islam and communism are evil, who is to say that vedic feudalism with its concepts of divinely ordained caste system is not evil. This is exactly why many hindus themselves(chiefly of the lower caste) oppose RSS.</comment>

<comment>"Vedic feudalism " lolzz... How about "vedic fascism" or "vedic communism" or maybe "vedic terrorism ".... Lolzz. Ur tongue can reach so far where ur d!ck gets cut!!!! Lolzzz!!!</comment>

<comment>The Entire Africa was there for Mother Theresa to choose for serving humanity but why did that lady from Albania choose Calcutta ? Because of the hidden agenda of these goons. There were and are numerous community development centres and local NGOs and charitable institutions of Indians and by Indians serving India. India is not bereft of humanity so as to get outside criminals to serve our people in the garb of humanity.</comment>

<comment>One of the other insiders, Sister Janaki had confessed that all the leprosy patients whom Mother Theresa claimed to have treated were brought to the Missionary hospital and were given only and only pain killers in high doses as a slow poison to kill them and then convert them before their death. Mother Theresa's these (in) humanly acts earned her the saint hood and the vatican goons used her as a mask to cover their sinister designs. So many millions of dollars have flowed in all these 67 years that the entire West Bengal would have become a super prosperous state if the forced conversion funds was utilized purely for development. The British b@stards after looting, exploting and r@ping India and Indians for 200 years, left behind the christian missionaries to civilize the 'uncivilized' pagan cow worshippers of Hinduism !</comment>

<comment>How successful are you in your conversion attempts in India ?Father JohnsonOh we are doing a good job. The Northeast Indian states like Assam, Nagaland, and Manipur, have witnessed a surge of nearly 200% in their Christian population in the past 25 years. Their grasp is so strong now that practicing Hinduism is forbidden in some areas. Hindus can no longer do worship or "puja’ in the open because of our influence.In another northeast state, Tripura, where there were no Christians at the time of India’s independence, 55 years ago, there are now over 120,000 today. The figures are even more striking in Arunachal Pradesh, where there were only 1710 Christians in 1961, but over 1 million today, along with over 780 churches. In the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, churches are coming-up every day in far flung villages and there is an attempt to set-up one near Tirupati, the world famous Hindu temple. Many of the North-East separatist movements, such as the Mizo or the Bodos, are not only Christian dominated, but also sometimes function with the covert backing of the missionaries. Christian Nagaland terrorists have been killing non-Christians for decades on end. More than 20,000 people have lost their lives to insurgency in Assam and Manipur in the past two decades. We understand that there are some social problems that crept up – the northeast states are the highest in India in terms of drugs and AIDS related problem – but we accept that as "casualties of war" –that should not deter us from our goal.</comment>

<comment>Is the so called caste system in India an advantage ?Father johnsonThe "Caste-ism in India’ is a boon to us. Though Varna or caste was once an essential part of the culture, based on occupation and vocational skills, which kept the civilization going for over 5000 years, caste-ism is a degenerated socio-political system now that has been declared illegal. However it is one big weapon against Hinduism. We have learnt from the colonial British that it is very easy to divide the population on the basis of caste and religion based politics and we use it to our own interest to the maximum. We join the anti-Hindu forces and help to keep the stigma of caste-ism alive for our own benefit. We target the "untouchables’ (the unprivileged people, that has so marvelously crafted to be a result of the Hindu religion and not the social system) and convert them in the lure of "liberating’ them. However I must confess that we maintain their "untouchability’ by not allowing them to mix with the general Christians, maintaining separate entry to churches and even giving them separate churches and cemeteries.We also use opportunities that God gives us. During natural disasters like floods, earthquakes and the recent Tsunami, taking advantage of the need, we were able to convert successfully entire low caste villages in Tamil Nadu to Christianity with the lure of money and aid.</comment>

<comment>The Vatican is extremely unhappy that its forced religious conversion programme has been halted and the Gujarat Hriday Samrat defeated all of its sinister designs and became Bharat Hriday Samrat. That is why there is so much of hatred against Modi and they tried to implicate him falsefully in 2002 riots, efforts to tarnish his image and defeat his govt are in full swing. Pre$$titutes are fed daily from the hands of Church. As per the Church, Muslims in India should never be allowed to support BJP. Church needs the Muslim support to defeat hindus and convert everyone to christianity.The Church is working against the will of Jesus by converting everyone. The Pope had said, we forcefully converted and planted the cross in europe and north america in first millenium, South america, australia and africa in the second millenium and now is the turn of Asia and especially India and China. That is why china has banned him and china says one more christian = one less chinese as they are brain washed by the pedophile, homosexual and r@pist fathers and archibishops and turn them into anti nationals !</comment>

<comment>Planted the cross in North America in the first millenium, eh? So Christopher Columbus and the Pilgrims must have encountered Christians in the 16th century, right?By the way, why do you use a Christian name to sling mud on Christians? And, puhleeze, don't tell me that you are a "former Christian" or some such nonsense. It's clear that the sangh is now reviving its anti-Christian activities after a lull during which Modi was air-brushed into the PMO.</comment>

<comment>He has a christian name and u r called Vivek. What an irony!!!</comment>

<comment>Excellent point!!</comment>

<comment>The sinister aim of the Sangh Parivar is to institutionalize the Saffron hate agenda in every sphere of governance and in this explicit purpose  it is using its political arm ruling at the Centre to diabolically take it forward .  What it is specifically aiming at is those key  Institutions which are in touch with the masses like academic, films, Prestigious scientific forums etc., in its insidious  attempt to trigger the so-called cultural engineering  in its efforts of  mobilization by brain washing the minds of the young and inculcate the ideals of Bharat Varsha as it would like to put it in an utopian  National perspective undermining the Nation's  pluralistic ethos  and overwhelming diversity !!The ideology of the RSS is more palatable to the upper castes as it closely identifies with those culture, traditions and the caste hegemony as envisaged in the scriptures.  It wants the Dalits in the H1ndu fold only on its terms by being reconciled to their despicable  status in the society and yet  cherish those traditions which have condemned them in such contemptible fashion !!And this dangerous trend of the Sangh Parivar gaining a foot hold and traction in every sphere of public Institution has to be nipped in the bud before it is too late !!</comment>

<comment>Neither you know the RSS ideology much nor you know what the fk you are talking about. And the author is smoking pot if he thinks RSS is not attractive to the youth of India.

<comment>The left and radical left have already institutionalized their hate and anti national agenda.  When the same is challenged, it could not be digested by the radical left.  The radical left used to be congress darbaris and pampered by them since independence.  Now other than Ford Foundation and vily anti national NGOs, they do not have any sponsors.</comment>

<comment>How can the Left and its radicals  institutionalize their hate when they were never in power at the Centre. Do not just babble just for the sake of it !!</comment>

<comment>The Left of Centre credentials of the Congress died when it became the votary of neo liberal policies !!There is only history.  There is no Left history or right history.

<comment>"thank liberal India"Well, that's the point, isn't it? For all their flaws, the "leftist-commie-congis" have not destroyed the liberalism of democratic India, something that the sangh is trying to do. The sangh is using the freedoms of a liberal democracy to destroy it, a tactic that was successfully used by the Nazis, after they realised that mere thuggishness would not propel them to power(see the similarity?). Given enough time, absolute rule by the BJP will destroy freedom of expression, and criminalize any opposition to the sangh.</comment>

<comment>What "liberalism" is there for the Sangh to destroy? It is the Congress that was hell bent on marginalizing opposing points of view, like those of the Communists and the Sangh itself, a very illiberal act, to perpetuate its hegemony in Indian politics. It was the Congress that introduced the 1st Amendment to the Indian Constitution to limit freedom of speech and property, that initiated the License Raj to strangle economic freedom, that started banning books and censoring films, that initiated the Emergency (that the Sangh fought against) and went so far as to censor Twitter when it was in power. For all of this fearmongering, the BJP hasn't done nearly as much to destroy freedom in India as the Congress has. Heck, it hasn't even fulfilled its Hindutva poll promises like ending Article 370 or building Ram Mandir, and can't even get basic legislative reforms, like easing land acquisition or establishing a GST, through parliament. No self respecting dictatorship would be willing to acknowledge BJP ruled India as such.</comment>

<comment>Putting the cart before the horse, aren't you? The BJP isn't a dictatorship.....yet. But the signs of what it will do if and when it does become one are showing up all the time. To use one of the VHP's favorite phrases, these are being tested in "crucibles".Marginalizing opposing points of view, as you put it, is very different from criminally prosecuting them, as the BJP is increasingly doing, or in using the machinery of the state to harass and intimidate critics. For all your criticisms of the Congress, has the BJP or the Shiv Sena done any better? Are they not using the CBI, the IT department and other official machinery to harass and marginalize opponents and critics, like the Congress did, but only even more brazenly?  Have they used their time in power to roll back the curbs on freedom of speech, to stop censorship of films and books? In actuality, they have pressed the curbs to the limits. As has been observed, the BJP is nothing but Congress plus a cow, the cow being symbolic of the retrograde and obsessive hindutva agenda of the BJP. There is a long, narrow and precipitous road ahead which will determine how India fares as a nation and as a true secular democracy.</comment>

<comment>At best, that just means that this is an Indian political tendency towards repression, not something unique to the BJP. People made these same predictions about Vajpayee, and nothing came of it. If anything, it is an indictment of the Congress that they set the bar very low for the BJP and other parties. As far as a "true secular democracy" is concerned, India is not and has never been truly secular; the Congress panders to minorities while the BJP panders to Hindus.</comment>

<comment>The point is that the BJP was supposed to be this super, incorruptible, can-do sort of party, and they are turning out to be no better than the Congress. It doesn't matter that the bar was set low, or that the Congress panders to minorities(which it doesn't actually, that's simply the spin placed on the generally secular tendencies of the INC), or that the Congress institutionalized corruption. The fact remains that the wunderkind BJP has the same cut of the jib, with the added baggage of a retrograde "cultural agenda".</comment>

<comment>There are no "generally secular tendencies" anywhere in Indian politics. Saying that minorities have the first right to national resources, as Manmohan Singh did, is not secularism. Protecting religious personal law, as the Congress does, is not secular. In this case, it is the BJP that is advocating the secular Uniform Civil Code. Having special autonomy of J&K, as well as Nagaland and Mizoram, but no Hindu state, is not secular, and again, it is the BJP that wants Article 370 removed. State control over Hindu temples, and only Hindu temples is not secular. State interference in Hindu educational institutions by misusing article 30 of the Indian Constitution, as the Congress does, is not secular. The Haj subsidy is not secular. The BJP's cultural agenda has more than its fair share of flaws, but it's much better than pandering to mullahs and missionaries, as the Congress does. Additionally, while the party is hardly incorruptible, it isn't spewing forward gargantuan scandals from Delhi on a regular basis, as the Congress did under MMS' second term.</comment>

<comment>"For all their flaws, the "leftist-commie-congis" have not destroyed the liberalism of democratic India, "They destroyed India in many ways and promoted their brand of "liberalism". Which was nothing but identity politics and caste aggravations mixed up with a brand of socialism that no genuine socialist would recognize.</comment>

<comment>If the hardcore nation-destroyers were not constantly stirring up trouble, the people would have had other issues to consider in voting them back into power. I am under no illusion as to the tactics of the sangh in the current situation either. For all the hype about development and patriotism, the BJP has not let go the core ideology of its parent, the RSS, which to any sane person is impractical short of a devastating civil war. Speaking of which, I have heard some sanghis actually support the notion of civil war as a means, in their addled minds, of "throwing out the Muslims from Bharatvarsh". The Christians, of course, would be a bonus "collateral damage".With regard to your comment about socialism, I recall that the BJP was vehemently opposed to opening up the Indian economy, and that its forebear, the JP, actually evicted multinationals from India and proclaimed that traditional Indian industry would carry the day. As it turns out, they made a u-turn after seeing that reversing the gains of economic liberalisation begun by Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh would be counterproductive. In fact, the major fear of business in 1998, when the BJP headed the coalition government, was that it would reverse the reforms, which the BJP assured them would continue. so you see, the BJP inherited a liberalised system that it was against to begin with, but then realised that it would be damaging to reverse it. So let's not give credit where it is not due.All that said, my remark that you quote stands: they did not destroy the liberalism of democratic India, which is something that remains a strong possibility under continued BJP rule.</comment>

<comment>the problem for RSS is upper class is now thoroughly westernized.

Knowledge of English, knowledge of modern science, knowledge of economics, modern law, modern medicine etc.The lower class on the other hand know that reservations which the upper class/caste is bitterly opposed to, is the key for them to grab power which they were hitherto denied, thus I fail to see how they reconcile with RSS.</comment>

<comment>Religion instead of spiritual elevation has only become a convenient tool to acquire power and in those days the treasures of Kings and Queens were hidden only in Temples, Churches  as kind of safe keeping. Thankfully the Bishops no longer weild absolute power like they did in the 16,17, and 18th centuries where even Kings have to be subservient to their wh1ms and fanc1es !!Well Chengiz Khan was  secular in the sense he didn't follow the organized religions, but he was a worshipper of blue sky.  But, you are right, he was tyrannical and ruthless to be a prisoner of his times. To his credit, he was the ultimate conqueror and  threatened the World with just a mention of his name.  The Sultan of Delhi then tremebled when he heard that Chengiz Khan was approaching India, but then he changed his plan and didn't touch India !!</comment>

<comment>RSS is actually a good organization with Hindu interests at heart. And I don't think they need to apologize for wanting to spread the rightful culture of Hindu civilization amongst the youth. Xtians and muslims do that all the time. But when a Hindu organization wants to preserve their culture, its considered communal. Were it not for the RSS, Hindus would slowly become a minority in their own motherland. RSS bashing has become the norm with these prestitutes...lage raho. Youth is awakening, to your dismay!</comment>

<comment>The RSS are not truly Hindu. They are simply a set of patriarchal men, elderly men, who are really in thrall to monotheistic thinking and would love to replace vibrant and multihued Hinduism with a monochromatic and dull Hindu version of monolithic religious thinking. </comment>

<comment>The problem is without it, there is no defence against the agressive predator religions/ideologies</comment>

<comment>The only protection for Hinduism over 5000 years has been its vibrancy and its ability to consume the aggressor. This it did, despite all the ugliness inherent within Hinduism, because it was vibrant and pluralistic. Middle aged and patriarchal minded men are no protection. Indeed, they are are the biggest danger to Hinduism, as they seek to mound it in the monochromatic form of the aggressors belief system. </comment>

<comment>Thanks continue with your beliefa</comment>

<comment>Vivekananda..ISIS is a deadly worm.. nothing can be done to teach them but ....is RSS really inspired by Vivekananda:This theory of Ishta, therefore, means allowing a man to choose his own religion. One man should not force another to worship what he worships. All attempts to herd together human beings by means of armies, force, or arguments, to drive them pell-mell into the same enclosure and make them worship the same God have failed and will fail always, because it is constitutionally impossible to do so. Not only so, there is the danger of arresting their growth. You scarcely meet any man or woman who is not struggling for some sort of religion; and how many are satisfied, or rather how few are satisfied! How few find anything! And why? Simply because most of them go after impossible tasks. They are forced into these by the dictation of others. For instance, when I am a child, my father puts a book into my hand which says God is such and such. What business has he to put that into my mind? How does he know what way I would develop? And being ignorant of my constitutional development, he wants to force his ideas on my brain, with the result that my growth is stunted. You cannot make a plant grow in soil unsuited to it. A child teaches itself. But you can help it to go forward in its own way. What you can do is not of the positive nature, but of the negative. You can take away the obstacles, but knowledge comes out of its own nature. Loosen the soil a little, so that it may come out easily. Put a hedge round it; see that it is not killed by anything, and there your work stops. You cannot do anything else. The rest is a manifestation from within its own nature. So with the education of a child; a child educates itself. You come to hear me, and when you go home, compare what you have learnt, and you will find you have thought out the same thing; I have only given it expression. I can never teach you anything: you will have to teach yourself, but I can help you perhaps in giving expression to that thought.</comment>

<comment>Functioning is becoming similar .. a Hindu or a Vedantee can never be so coward.... see what Vivekananda says on different religions:"No one form of religion will do for all. Each is a pearl on a string. We must be particular above all else to find individuality in each. No man is born to any religion; he has a religion in his soul. Any system which seeks to destroy individuality is in the long run disastrous. Each life has a current running through it, and this current will eventually take it to God. The end and aim of all religions is to realize God. The greatest of all training is to worship God alone. If each man chose his own ideal and stuck to it, all religious controversy would vanish"</comment>

Anyone eulogizing anti-nationalists individuals need to be shot and shut out, even if it is you.You are a party who calls for a fight till India is destroyed and what kind of nationalism and patriotism you claim.  There are hundreds of millions of patriotic people and do you want them to take you few hundreds seriously.Yeah ! we would take you seriously for a destruction of your fountainhead of anti-national thoughts. If you call yourself a left oriented element in the society and if you are recognized by the established left parties in India, THEN they too will be included in your category and taken to task the way you all deserve.</comment>

<comment>I like Godse , would i be branded an anti national ?</comment>

<comment>Ask yourself Goddu for your question has no relevance to the subject in hand.   I shall repeat that those who wow to fight till the end to destroy India are anti nationals.  Now introspect and ask yourself whether you would take such a wow.  I shall then answer your question.</comment>

<comment>Our Dharmic children and  youth have always been ours.We are battling Abrahamic evangelists who wish to harvest their souls</comment>

<comment>Why no article on JNU left party students protest condemning Afsal Guru hanging with slogan against India in firstpost???. But they have article on ABVP. If it was not for ABVP, JNU leftist student antinational activities would not have come in media. Writer should understand that for balance there should be always yin/negative(left) and yang/positive(right) in correct proportion and not just yin for better future.</comment>

<comment>Left and BJP are two sides of the same coin.. both are negative ..</comment>

<comment>Your brain too is negative.</comment>

<comment>For the so called sickularists anything to do with the BJP or the RSS is always wrong. When the CONgress was ruling they appointed their people as heads of Institution, When the BJP does it its wrong. According to the Sickularists any person who supports the Majority community is right winged, and he is not qualified for the post.</comment>

<comment>Yes,but these so called sickular people forget that raising slogan like fight till the end of countries destruction is equivalent to  'chopping a branch they're sitting on'. It will lead to not only their destruction but also others who thrive on that branch. Either these sickular people have completely brain washed or they don't belong to this country. </comment>

<comment>Brain Wash Game!! They know very well their rhetoric will have no takers post a decade from now, their ideas on nationalism is grossly flawed and skewed towards violence, arm twisting etc. They might still find takers in some states a decade from now but the end is not to far.</comment>

<comment>Congress spoiled most of the central universities by appointing leftist s as Vice chancellors. If leftists or centrists can have presence in these institutes ,why not the rightists. This is as per aticle-14 of constitution.Equal opportunity to all. If congress can appoint Vice-Chancellors of their liking , why not BJP. what is wrong in this. Writer needs to change his mindset ,which is only ANTI-BJP.</comment>

<comment>Chaddi dhari gang...ha ha ha</comment>

<comment>Why Chamaars like you hate  other Hindus and love Muslims, become Muslims and get lost .</comment>

<comment>RS is danger to our country and believe in divide and hatred .</comment>

<comment>The doors of Ram temple at ayodhya were opened at theinstance of Rajiv Gandhi there is much material written by many peoples pointsthat.who was head of the country at the time of relatively large scale tworiots. Yes, I am talking of 1984 anti-sikh pogrom at Delhi and October 1989anti-muslim riots at Bhagalpur. The SC appointed SIT was never constituted toinvestigate the interests and participation of top head of country and hisrequirements of these two riots just before respectively two general loksabhaelections 84 & 89 in country. Yes, the Congress’s centralgovernment, law and order situation and police of Delhi is always remainedbusiness of Ministry of Home “central govt. GOI”, and in case of Bhagalpurthere was also the Congress’s Bihar Government. In Delhi riots about 2700people were killed and in Bhagalpur riots about 1180 people were killed almostequal to after Godhra 2002 , these are figures of police records not fromrumors. Both Delhi pogrom and Bhagalpur riots blew-up in small geographicalareas when compared to riots in most portion of Gujarat including thousands ofvillages in 2002, which implies that Post Godhra riots were relativelydifficult to control. A very few number of Hindus lessthan 10 were killed in all three ways “security forces bullets + in retaliationof opposite community + rioting mob of opposite community” at both places Delhi& Bhagalpur , but in case of 2002 almost 150 to 200 Hindus were dead due toall three ways. All these three ways were absolutely missing in Delhi andBhagalpur riots means very few incidents of retaliation by Sikhs and Muslims.2002 post Godhra riots and Delhi 1984 pogrom were in control after three daysand In Gujarat there is very few killings on both side of communities afterthree days that too in rural areas difficult to control but Bhagalpur riotshappened for very longer span of time. There was largest unorganized mob onroads in differently scattered places of Gujarat 2002 after Godhra ( someleftist journos in their bid to show communal Gujarat like above themselvessays that 20 lakhs peoples were on roads in different villages ) , so it wasvery difficult to predict that where & when and which section of mob willconvert in to rioters . Both post Godhra riots & 1984 pogrom were aftersudden provocative happenings not predictable one but this was not the case ofBhagalpur riots. Many peoples think that 1989 Bhagalpur riots on the eve ofGeneral Loksabha elections were left to happen to appease the Hindus of thecountry after two disgraceful chronological events Shah Bano episode in 1986exposing the HardIslamist fundamentalist face of Rajiv Gandhi even Left was against theconstitutional amendment done by Rajiv Gandhi in this matter & Boforsscandal , there was a series of events to appease Hindus- Opening of Locks& Silanayas of Ram Temple Ayodhya-UP (relevant to mention before this BJPhad failed to make Ram Mandir a issue) , killing of appx. 50 muslims youth atMeerat Malyana-Hashimpura-UP many peoples says that that had happened in custodyof security forces ( Govt. at UP was also of Cong ) , starting the Loksabhaelection campaigning from Ayodhya by top head of country , experience ofextraordinary win of largest ever 424 loksabha seats of 1984 elections after astrong communal consolidation with help of anti sikh riots was to be repeatedin 1989 but in vain. Some says that in case of Bhagalpur the Muslims weredemanding the transfer/removal of a Hindu S.P. , Superintendent of Police ,from Bhagalpur but in vain when 1st incident of about 70 Muslims killings takesplace the Bihar Govt. of Cong.announces the transfer but after visit of Prime Minister to Bhagalpur thattransfer was cancelled and main incidents of killings of Muslims take place inanother three days. No one telling that there was communal anger in very largepublic after Godhra train burning same after assassination of Smt. IndiraGandhi , but this was not the case of Bhagalpur. Anger in case of 2002 Gujaratwas so large that in some cases brotherly neighbors ( having very very goodfamily relations earlier ) were inviting rioters to kill their neighbors andlater on as some time passes they feel guilt , this thing is very much evidentfrom telling of riots victims them self on great anti BJP NDTV & otherchannels and media like Outlook and Anti BJP so called intellectuals &jurnos like VM, VS , Thanavi , Rajdeep , Barkha and endless lists . So it wasrelatively much much difficult to control riots in case of 2002. If 2002 was aHindu-Muslim killing spreewhere Muslim deaths were four times as high as Hindu ones, in 1984 the numberof Hindus killed was zero. In fact, it was a Congress sponsored pogrom, and notquite a Hindu-Sikh clash. It was entirely one-sided. Rajiv Gandhi may not havecaused it, but he chose to ignore this for three days directly under his noseit altogether and let it happen and harness the political gains by preponementof loksabha elections. That in 2002 there was already highly viciousenvironment nationally and internationally as 1. attack on Indian Parliamenthad happened recently and 2. Indian Military was on borders under a operation (Perrakerram ? ) 3. 9/11 happened USA was engage Afghanistan after 9/11 etc..Military was called from border and was available on roads with shoot and sightorders just on next day of riots i.e. 1st march after 1st riot on 28th feb.Military and Police saved life of many peoples but in some cases unfortunatelypolice only saved himself , run away frightened of big mob of rioters in frontof them , their this activity left poor victims alone in front of bigcommunally angered mobs. In very few cases Police employees may haveactedcommunally . More so this is in very much contrast to what some personssays in case of Bhagalpur that almost in every significant incident ofBhagalpur 1989 , a different village on different day was being attacked by mobleaded by police itself as if police is doing some milittary operation andleading the mob to do something. In , Gujarat 2002 riots , there was entirelydifferent mobs at different places acting more or less simultaneously; up tosome extant different scenario from Bhagalpur. In case of Gujarat police &military was having shoot & sight orders but in case of Delhi initially theArmy was not called itself from Delhi Cantt. for one day and more so that armywas not having shoot & sight orders for another two/three days. I acceptthat environment in 1984 was also vicious not only by assassination on IndiraGandhi but also due to sikh militant activities of killing Hindus after pullingthem from buses & trains. But main stream of Sikh terrorism started after1984. Even so called intellectuals never talk about the benefits consolidatedby Rajiv Gandhi after 1984 was so huge and well collected gains of Riots bypreponing the election and same was planned anti Muslim Riots in Meeruth UP andBhagalpur Bihar under watch of Cong. Govts were there before 1989 elections .In Indian election history there is only one Prime Minister candidate who hadstarted his campaigning from Ayodhya and that is Rajiv Gandhi in 1989 by allthis he was trying to erase , Bofors and Saha Bano episode which he hadrealized that he had played foul even when both type of cadres Left & RSShad welcomed the Supreme Court decision in Saha Bano case but he chooses tobecome/appease Hardliner Muslim ( but realized later that he was wrong ) , fromPublic Memory and trying to repeat 1984 election success. I think that it isploy of Cong. that to keep Muslims economically & socially backward , Sothat they can remain a en-block Vote Bank which can be used whenever needed byusing some religious lollypops as Muslim Personal Law, Huj Subsidy , Salary toImams, Wakkf Board etc. and some time fear of security. This is proved by factsof conditions of Muslims in West Bangal & UP & Bihar. In these threestates Muslims are having very less % in Govt. Jobs in comparison to theirlarge % in population. Pl.don’t accept that Muslims were already in poor conditions in these threestates. It is very much clear that conditions of Muslims in these three statesis deteriorating where’s it is improving in rest of India. I also accept thatworldwide it is Muslim community which is most easily usable by harpingreligious sentiments and then stopping their economical progress so that theyremains a vote-bank.</comment>

<comment>RSS is the life line of India</comment>

<comment>Really? Is that line visible?</comment>

<comment>Bhaskar your sarcasm originates from the fountainhead of your ignorance or your efforts to create darkness on a midday summer  by shutting your eyes.Everything is not visible for eyes but those that are not visible can be felt.  Is the oxygen that you breath visible? It is not for anyone. Everyone will die without it.  Just that oxygen is not visible does not mean it doesn't exist.Your question is as stupid as above.</comment>

<comment>I hate RSS but if they destroy the left bastion JNU , all good wishes to them.</comment>

<comment>RSS is a nationalist organization, serving Bharat, for 5000 years, in one form or another.Why do you hate them and not Abrahamic evangelists or Mulsim league?</comment>

<comment>for 5000 years!!!!</comment>

<comment>Yes.At least.Our Dharam , our philosophy is at least that old.</comment>

<comment>RSS serving for 5000 years!!!! In that case Mohan Bhagwat must be 6000 years old.</comment>

<comment>The philosophy of Shri Bhagwat is, over 5,000 years old.</comment>

<comment>I hate all religious bigots. no discrimination in my hate be it paedo priests, mullhas, maulvis, sants, babas...</comment>

<comment>How is Rastriya Swamwnsevak Sangh,  religious bigots.?</comment>

<comment>kya bole sirji, this is beyond satire, parody, saracasm,....</comment>

<comment>Could be.Still, when you make an allegation, back it with evidence.If you cannot, let it go, for you only demean yourself.Attacking Dharmic people, our Dhramic Philosophy is a favorite game with Abrahamic Xtians and Islamicists.Yet the same Abrahamics survive and thrive in our nation  because of our /RSS tolerance.</comment>

<comment>After Modi becoming PM, ISIS Taliban & Al-Qaida had joined hand and conducted a seminar wherein Indian Maulanas were invited for both preparatory & refreshers course on BRAINWASHING the Indian Muslims, but guess what our chaddies faked the maulanas and attended this course. Now these chaddies are being appointed by Modi, Smriti Irani & team to the top posts in educational institutes, universities, as well as other post of prominence like governor, to bring in Sanghi/Hindutva Ideological wave which will forever change the future of our gullible and innocent teens just like the recent gravitational wave which is intended to change the future of science.</comment>

<comment>How many chaddis did u have to wear to contain the seeping stinking grey matter lava from ur black hole created due to discovery of those gravitational waves???? I guess infinity.... so does a measure of stupidity!!!</comment>

<comment>Saudi Arabia has an interesting system, the Al Saud family conducts the business of governing  while the religious and cultural body consisting of hard line  Wahabis  take care of all religious and cultural aspect of the country . The Wahabis and their sympathisers are appointed in top posts that make decisions on education , censor ,information and broadcasting ,university curricula as wells as all religious and cultural aspects including what people should eat ,what books should be banned ,what movies should be censored and how people should dress.Anyone questioning or opposing them would be labeled an anti national and anti Islam and would be most likely  shot , imprisoned in dark cell ,disappear  or get their heads chopped off.Recruiting more and more young minds to the Wahhabi ideology has become difficult for them these days and they are trying their best to re brand themselves to the young.</comment>

<comment>These arguments about Saudi Arabia good for Saudi Arabia.  But when someone shouts slogans against India, being an Indian, holding and enjoying all facilities as an Indian citizen, is a traitor and anti-national.You cannot subjugate a majority in the country like you did them in J&K and continue with your political machinations.Time has ripened and there will be strong retaliation against any attempts to mute the majority who are known for their sobriety but even a butterfly can sting this time around.</comment>
