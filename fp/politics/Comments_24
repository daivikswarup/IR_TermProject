<comment>wh have a HRD minister Kapil Sibal...and in his rule CBSE class 10 and 12 exams have become joke....all are getting 95% onwards....one has to get 100% to get admission in colleges of choice...this is what the education system implemented by ex minister and they are so called educated...the way Smriti has conducted in Parliament...all those who used to take pot shot on her about her education must be hiding their face out of shame....a class 12 passout has whitewashed the great of JNu and DU....and what not...</comment>

<comment>Smriti Irani proved why she is considered a great actress...drama queen. Rohit Vemula issue is unnecessarily being politicized by both the BP and opposition, because no political party is keen to discuss real issues with our education system. I dare Smriti to bring in reforms in our education system and bring it at par with developed countries instead of wasting her time on such non issues.</comment>

<comment>She may not be the best HRD minister. But considering her corrupt and incompetent predecessor Kapil Sibal, she appears divine.</comment>

<comment>the congress and the left are digging their own graves...they are doomed now.</comment>

<comment>Yes they really are...</comment>

<comment>If this was 1940 she would be next great leader.But we know your fake degrees.</comment>

<comment>fake degree ? she never failed in acting but pappu failed everywhere in politics :p</comment>

<comment>Really you are some God who knows everything. Do you know Rahuls fake ones too?</comment>

<comment>Atleast i know she is unfit to hrd , if she was entertainment or sensor board i would have had some respect. </comment>

<comment>Considering her utterly incompetent predecessor Kapil Sibal, she is divine</comment>

<comment>It is really funny. The existing Government does n't know how to face the public problems which were raised by opposition parties.  The way of reactions by Women ministers SushmaSwaraaj in last session, Smriti Irani, HRD minister is  being given a perception a personal problem.  Raising voices by collecting more evidences looking like a civil court perception.  Bringing the personalities of last Bharat Ratna achieved PrimeMinisters and insulting the present opposition leaders in a cheapmanner giving a perception like mass in a village.  The dignity of Government will be perspective in a Global scenario while the Prime Minister and His Ministry must control their emotions, feelings of personal and to look into the problem where the total country disturbed the dignity of University of Hyderabad.  University of Hyderabad has its world level rank with its standards, the psychological perception should not be interrupted by the Government.  ISO certified Universities must be respected by the present Government.  They are not private universities.  They are not belonging to particular parties.  Leave the history of older problems neglected by the past Government whether they have not looked into the matter at that time or not.  Now the present Government was in opposition party, failed to bring these suicide problems to blame the past government when ruling occured.  Live in present.  Thinking the problem of University under the Minister of Human Resource Development raised the voices by all communities as a problem due to the overinvolvement of Central Minister Dattatreya. Not to react as personal sacrifice and react to 'resign' for the ethics of Pure Government.  The systems oppositions with different parties wiell bring the problems of people to the Parliament is a Right of the whole.  The Government has to respond politely and ready to accept mistakes and ready to resolve problems in a ethical manner.  Because India is the biggest Democratic country.  The people can not be easily satisfied by diverting minds with personal views.  Everything must be within the boundary of Indian Constitution of Law.  If not nothing will be gained within fiveyears 2014-19.  Already two years will be completing soon.  Till now no image of respect to constitution has achieved by the BJP which is  the largest party next to All India Congress.Time and Tide waits for none. Utilizing  or destructing  time is in the present Government.  The ball is in their court.  How to kick democratically or bureaucratically is their choice of think.  People just follow and observed till 2019 keeping quiet themselves.</comment>

<comment>Pity your State of mind, What is meant by ISO certified University, why are you talking bullshit, writing such lengthy message does not make you an Intellectual, any Institution  or organisation is certified for the process it follows in different functions, but it does not certify or allow people to talk whatever they want, Stop doing politics with Children.Now we understand that none in the world will care a hoot for you and your communist views, you are on the verge of extinction, Public have Thrown you out , so you are now surviving on the Innocent children who have out of poverty have opted to get educated in the Government aided university, and are lured into your thought process with helping them get their scholarships or coercing them into your failed ideology.Shame here also you are looting / cheating/ troubling the poor, when will you leave them, why are you again and again reminding them of their caste/ religion are gaining political mileage.Communism has failed in the place of it`s origin, have you forgotten Tianmen Square where thousand`s of protesting students were killed, does these children know that, China is no more Communist with rampant Corporate policies and corrupt politicians embedded in a Controlled Dictatorship.None of the average population will buy your story, so you have identified innocent students and are piggy riding on them</comment>

<comment>Really Congress knows how to face public? Work is being done, anyone asking IRCTC via twitter is getting help on train, Anyone writing to HRD ministry is getting back answers and you are giving a BS crass botched up comment with no real value here</comment>

<comment>How dare these Maoist`s talk on Mahishasura mardini, Sitarma Yechuri, You were born in a Hindu caste and your parents were Hindu`s, Unfortunately you have turned out to be Mir Jafar of INDIA</comment>

<comment>Search is on  where the Congress has gone hiding, This Generation of Congress has been Baptised by the Church, they are no more Indians , The Congress has become the slave of the Church, If Sonia Gandhi has to escape from all the financial Looting, she has to toe the line of the Church.Understand that Sonia Rahul Priyanka & Robert are stooges of the Church, What happened to all the other leaders, they are shameless to survive on this world, why are they still in Congress / are working against India.God save this country From Sonia & Rahul Gandhi`s</comment>

<comment> AP govt. given 25 lakhs to rohit vemula mother. but those r only enough for her delhi flight expenses. today she came to me with no money in hand and asking for help. i have generously responded to that poor woman.</comment>

<comment> versus from Scamgress holy book, a must read for aap soldiers:chapter 5, verse 3When you work to destroy India, claim you are an atheist and a Leftist fighting to free the oppressed of India from the the tyranny of Upper Caste Hindu Male. And stupid dhimmi Hindus would stampede to support you. Of course you know that if India collapses, Muzlims will get to pick up the pieces, not the stupid kafir comrades.chapter 5, verse 4When caught by law, immediately go back to being a poor Muzlim victim, and stupid dhimmi Hindus would still rush to support you.</comment>

<comment>The British wanted to destroy and plunder India with much more vigor than the Islamic invaders. They knew it was a difficult task and the only way out is to destroy its age old culture, the Gurukula system and Desi cow population. The reconstructions of the Hindu Puranic tales started immediately after winning the Battle of Plassey. This had gone unchallenged most of the time because of indifference, unwilling to argue on something considered as absurd and lack of knowledge of history, epics and Hinduism by modern Hindus themselves. The re-interpretation of the Durga Puja is based on the dubious Aryan Invasion Theory some 4000 years back. Aryan was not a race and there was no Aryan invasion. The Indians have dark complexion. It is a fact that the white skinned Europeans and Arab invaders had subjugated the native population. The religion of white skinned aliens were either Islam or Christianity. The worship of Adi ParaShakti or VanaDurga is a tribal practice. The Ramayana was written by a tribal. VedVyasa was not a Brahmin either. One Evangelist poster read "Shiva kills Jesus saves", referring the Trimurthy concept in Hinduism where Lord Shiva is the Destroyer</comment>

<comment>If leftists do not believe in Hindu Gods, how can they believe in Mahishasur which is part of Hindu Purans? Many people are saying Muppathi mukodi (Tamil  or Malayalam) gods in Hinduism. There is no specific word for that number in English to count Hindu gods. The same number of Asuras are also there. In Hinduism one can worship any God or Asura. Even if you dont worship, then that is also acceptable. But the Western dogmatic religions believe in single god and the faith with total surrender is a must. One misleading Evangelist poster read "Shiva kills Jesus saves", referring the Trimurthy concept in Hinduism where Lord Shiva is the Destroyer.</comment>

<comment>Awesome Speech by Irani, I feel embarrassed that I belonged to the camp that felt she lacked credentials but she proved every critic wrong.</comment>

<comment>Good reportage on what she said.It is shocking how our text books are being used by anti nationals to poison the minds of our children.</comment>

<comment>she should have exposed how communist parties use dalits as cannon fodder.Leadership: all high castefoor soldiers to die: poor dalits.</comment>

<comment>now Sitaram Yehcury is shitting in his pants with Smrithi reply</comment>

<comment>Goddess Durga was reincarnated in 1971 in the form of Indira Gandhi,when she destroyed Jinnah's pet 'Two Nation' Theory, by truncating the nation called Pakistan. Goddess Durga has reincarnated a second time in 2016 in the form of Smriti Irani, who demolished whatever left over image of Congress Party as a party committed to National Development and welfare of people of India. She has proved beyond any doubt that today's Gandhi Family and Congress party will do anything to stay in power, even if it requires destroying this country. All they care for is immediate political gratification by hurting their political rivals, and scoring a few brownie point along the way. And to achieve this, they will  go to any extent, even indulging in anti national activities. Enough of basking under the old glories of Congress party during Mahatma's time, and enough of sham association with the surname of Father of Nation. This is no Mahatma's Congress and these are no real Gandhis to stake claim on His legacy. Time has come to wind up this party once in for all, so that the glories of the past of Congress party are not buried in the rubles of the present. This is what the Mahatma himself wanted</comment>

<comment>Excellent speech. Opposition collapsed like pack of cards.</comment>

<comment>Total bakwas full of lies and shouting. The whole problem is her creation, now she is unsuccessfully back paddling.</comment>

<comment>How can you say that? Come with facts instead of words like she did come up with facts. U r bakwas btw.</comment>

<comment>then why opposition walked out and were not there o counter? if it was lies she read reports official submitted and official communication if that lie god bless you</comment>

<comment>She was very Loud screaming and looked very very insecure, who can discuss anything with a person in that state, she was beside herself ..she wrote five letters. She is now married to parsi  she is Bengali and Punjabi mix..what the heck she is talking abut her jaat , she is from upper three castes definitely not dalit.Arresting student based on doctored tapes is clearly wrong. It seems that the Zee tv and Times now are running the government, bully Rohit was also very worng. The government is in pits...</comment>

<comment>Telangana Mr. is controlled by Congress and the University he died in is also controlled by them..so stop your brain wash and see the truth and re-watch her whole video before commenting Mr.</comment>

<comment>Urs are very small i know u r jealous..</comment>

<comment>shows ur stature</comment>

<comment>Yo Hindu Slaves...... Do you see the Taj Mahal? At least in beautiful pictures? How about the Red Fort where your nation looting and corrupt leaders give speeches? Remember each time that your slave forefathers carried bricks day in and day out with Mughul lashes... they did not eat Mughlai Chicken Biryani or Shahi Beef Kabob... That is luxury food..... Remember that each time you eat Mughlai food in expensive Indian restaurants. You like fair skin and long legs of Katrina Kaif, Alisha Bi (Hema Malini), Tabu, Saira Banu and Shabana Azmi? ..... my soldiers gave Mughul genes to your short and dark Dravidian women. Thank Allah for not having to see actors like Rajnikanth every day.... Once a slave... always a slave..... You all have Mughul blood... Auarangabad, Gaziabad, Islampur, Shayari, Music, Dance, Architecture....It is everywhere.... You cannot erase your coward history of 1,000 years......Now get back to work... No slacking... Babri Masjid must be completed on schedule...</comment>

<comment>Listen Dumbass, you Muslims are the slaves! Look at your filth in the middle east and refugees in Europe. The whole world hates you. You spout racist crap about skin colour, height, etc. but fail to recognize and uplift your own and what about your fellow co-religionists, the African Muslims. Your Arab filth religion started in the most obscene way, it is by some pact with the devil that your cult still exist in this day and age. Terrorist slaves is what you wretched souls are.</comment>

<comment>Sick...u must be supplying your women....Bharwe..</comment>

<comment>Your Mughals my foot. You'll never get Babri masjid.</comment>

<comment>What an amazing speech . Rarely one comes across such marvelous speech . .</comment>

<comment>What a melodramatic speech filled with lies! Fact is, BJP is an anti-dalit party that wanted to kill dalit students like Rohit Vermula.</comment>

<comment>Rohit was official diagnozed with BIPLOAR disorder. he has not mentioned any name in his suicide note.if you have proof BJP ABVP killed him please file FIR or ask PAPPU to do it</comment>

<comment>People with Bipolar  don't kill themselves.</comment>

<comment>BTW Telangana and both university where he died is controlled by the Congress so shit it out somewhere that BJP went and killed someone there...stupid</comment>

<comment>go read science, it depends on intensity of attack, i had a colleague who had to be chained in hospital for days to get him back to normal, and escorted back to india by 2 ppl when he had attack he stabbed himself anf hotel staff.. dont fart your brain here without knowing facts</comment>

<comment>give one proof that  Rohit was killed by BJP. He was suspended with other students for indiscipline, the committee suspending him had no BJP member no BJP member shot or poisoned him. Do not be so biased in hatred that you skip over facts.</comment>

<comment>Fat gayi Jal Gayi  Phunk gayi. Bujhh gayi?</comment>

<comment>One thing is Permanent Absolute Truth - 'Pappu' will remain only Pappu, the dud damp squib.The Fake rant of 'Pappu revival' by India Today is not only a 'figment imagination' but a mere convoluted half truth vented out by 'incorrigible sycophants'.He doesn't have any merit of originality like his father - his father ended up listening to the 'Corrupt Coterie' and guess our 'Pappu the Stupid' neither listens to anyone nor thinks before he speaks.</comment>

<comment>She caught all opposition pants down.. including you pre$$titutes.. so now write all kind of sh!t you want..</comment>

<comment>why did she give her panties to Modi then?</comment>

<comment>yes, you and other congressis/leftists can smell her panties, nothing more!!!</comment>

<comment>I love the Gandhi - Nehru parivar. They are like the proverbial monkey between the 2 cats. Just ignite the passion and watch the fun from a distant land. Once the foolish peoples of this country fight it out and burn it down, they will swoop in like vultures to feed on the carcass. Else, how do you explain allowing the Teestas to do our children's text books that is patently anti national? It is one thing to put down every one's views and another to denounce the very nation that we live in. We as citizens do not have the time to teach our kids history because it is useless to them to know. Bed time stories are a thing of the past and there is no way of knowing what the child is studying in school. Else the children would have countered the parents views on history. Needless to say we are digging our own graves and a big one too. The vultures will have a fabulous feast in the making.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the designing of school curricula should be the work of qualified, rational and child friendly professionals. Not the work of Teesta Setalwads or Dinanath Batras. </comment>

<comment>I like your balanced statement.</comment>

<comment>I I I hv been living under a rock,not a sentence from Batra was inclyded, he met HRD minister and  requested it </comment>

<comment>These so called students cannot get 5000 rs job outside, so easiest way for them to gain name,fame and money is join politics but politics is already very competitive.  So do what? ?  Do all antinational and anti Hindu (they dont have guts to say any thing against any other religion because their throat will be slit ) and claim you r dalit/muslim and hence victimized.</comment>

<comment>JNU bastards in addition to sedition case must also be booked for insulting Hindu religious sentiments by talking filth about MAA DURGA. Congress and Communists must explain whether they  support this statement by anti-national JNU students.</comment>

<comment>If talking about the prophet can land ppl in jail....</comment>

<comment>Congress clown prince is the best bet for NDA second term!</comment>

<comment>Agree. The only thing standing between the BJP and electoral defeat in 2019, is the Clown Prince. </comment>

<comment>LOL</comment>

<comment>Some idiots are talking about the asura as dark skinned. The darker color is meant to depict the evil qualities of the Asura and not to show racial differences! These westernized Indians are so unIndian that they see western notions of color prejudice in all things. It is like seeing Hitler and Nazis in the swastika of the Hindus!</comment>

<comment>Why is dark associated with evil qualities, I wonder?</comment>

<comment>The worldwide symbolism in all religions is that light represents Good and Darkness is evil. From there came the natural equivalents of white and black.</comment>

<comment>Asuras were the Original Brahmins, Shiva Bhakts and opposite to Aryans.</comment>

<comment>The age of asura was before the caste system, the JNU guys need to read history</comment>

<comment>Read the wedding advertisement in new paper by middle classes asking for fair bride..Most Indians like you are full of lies and pretensions..</comment>

<comment>Agree ... we Indians are one of the most "apart-heid" society in the world, and one of the most racist.We need to acknowledge this fact.Irrespective of the fact that there is no society which is not - but nothing justifies our own racism.</comment>

<comment>If sumone wants fair bride...whats the harm?be tolerant!!</comment>

<comment>Just trying to prove that Indians are one of the most color conscious race.</comment>

<comment>Really, but Kaali and Krishna are black and are worshipped. Women like guys like Krishna, tall dark and handsome. Are they being intolerant to the fat guys?</comment>

<comment>Yes fat ugly guys and girls protest.</comment>

<comment>who will u marry...naomi campbell or katrina kaif...i mean if given a choice</comment>

<comment>Too late ... I am already married, to a person who I love.And did not bother to ask which caste or religion.</comment>

<comment>In India everybody can tell if someone is from lower caste..don't try to be smart.</comment>

<comment>lol...he didnt even ask u... why so intolerant ! :D :D</comment>

<comment>Yes,all the interracial p*rn is from India right?Moron.</comment>

<comment>You are mixing up issues like other confused under-educated people. People do like fair skinned spouses. So what? I am talking about the depiction of Asuras as darker an an expression of their evil.</comment>

<comment>Didn't you say that color discrimination is western trait..were you lying.</comment>

<comment>Your comprehension is clearly very poor. I said "....see western notions of color prejudice in all things". It MEANS that westerners because of their own history see color depictions in terms of race and that we do not. NOT that "color discrimination is western trait"! This is why you guys are non-credible.</comment>

<comment>What would you call caste preference in marriages ? Ain't that racist ?</comment>

<comment>No it is not racist, people have a right to wed whom they like, who are you to impose your ideas on others? As long as there is no discrimination based on caste, one can choose whom they want to eat with, whom they want to marry and whom they want to be seen with.</comment>

<comment>Not all. Besides the lower caste ppl also want to marry their own caste, why that is?</comment>

<comment>Like other confused Indians you are using that term without any understanding. Caste is caste and not race. Scientific studies have shown that except for a few differences all Indian including muslims are genetically homogeneous. Indians are essentially one race with some minor mixing with caucasian, central asian genes for eg.</comment>

<comment>Of course it is</comment>

<comment>Aint u Indian?</comment>

<comment>irani is maid of   modi .....n modi is maid of arvind kejriwal</comment>

<comment>and ur mom is maid of modi</comment>

<comment>Was Rohit really a dalit? If not, then he must be knowing that he was not dalit.  If that were true, why he lead or hijacked the dalit politics? There are many holes in this whole episode. Unless we know what these holes are, we can not go to the roots of this problem. Those who are shouting standing on a tall wall do not want us to go and tackle the roots of this problem. They simply are not interesting in solving the problems because they themselves are the roots of these problems facing the country for a long time. That's why there were no true discussions or debates, but only disruptions of the democratic institutions on this or other issues.</comment>

<comment>Are you Dalit.He was from lower castes despised by upper classes.</comment>

<comment>Yes, Rohit knew he was dalit becaause he had dalit certificate and his parents were dalits. BJP is anti-dalit, that's why Smriti sent letters forcing Rohit to kill himself.</comment>

<comment>Do you have proof? Did you see smiriti irani's letter? Congress is not only anti dalit but anti national. They divided and ruled Indian people for 60 years. No more, people have understood the truth. So keep barking for the next 10 years on tolerance and other bull****!!</comment>

<comment>The whole thing is class war, the upper 20 to 30 percent are scared of 70 percent lower classes. With one man one vote they will soon rule the country, they are now getting aware of their rights and power.</comment>

<comment>Are you sure about the stats</comment>

<comment>So if it was class war, why are u dividing the lower classes on caste?</comment>

<comment>So telling the truth and not shoving under the carpet is dividing. You can only do something if you identify the problem..otherwise you will end up with civil war.</comment>

<comment>You are shifting the goalpost when u can't defend one or the other. First u say caste is the problem, then u say its the class. If u were committed to either u would not target the other</comment>

<comment>Caste and class in india are interchangeable..Brahmin high class..shudra lower class.</comment>

<comment>what about a millionaire shudra like mayawati... is she lower class?she gets more benefit and commands more power than me n is much more influential... will u say she is lower class?</comment>

<comment>They are very few and far in between...majority are excruciatingly poor. Khaniya family didn't even had to money to offer journalist cup of tea. Millions of well off upper classes..</comment>

<comment>You are an idiot. Kanhaiya is from an upper caste Bhumihar family.</comment>

<comment>Politicians are fuelling this divide between dalits/others.... if dalits fall in this trap.. they remain where they are... instead use the quotas...get education...get govt reserved jobs ... and kindly get rid of ur hatred for upper castes</comment>

<comment>It is not politicians but your and my ancestors created most horrible and sick society.</comment>

<comment>Indeed they are fewer than the Brahmins even, but accumulate all the benefits owed to their poorer brethren. There should be a census of what is the avg. income of ppl who take the reservations.</comment>

<comment>no wonder u r not in India or may b u r part of the rich lower caste who monopolize govt. quotas for generations and prevent the poor brothers of same caste to get the benefits.</comment>

<comment>Lower castes is 70 percent to give benefit to lower castes we will have to take lot from high castes..we will have to bring them down or create millions of new homes and jobs.It is funny now you have started speaking like a higher castes who thinks he has the power to talk down and insult and he gets that power by virtue of birth.</comment>

<comment>the rich lower castes monopolizing all the benefits owed to the 70% poor lower caste is even smaller than % of Brahmins. I am only saying u need to give up ur benefits and give it to these guys. Charity starts at home.</comment>

<comment>Use your brain top 10% have more money than bottom 50 percent. One king can mass billions depriving the whole country. I do give up many benefits, it is your and your clans turn...instead of asking for money from followers give back some.</comment>

<comment>How do u know who is scared?</comment>

<comment>you know how many students died committed suicide in universities in past 10 years or 5 years?whats so special about Rohit? special is comes from a supposedly vote bank community and politics can be done on his dead body</comment>

<comment>Most Dalits never made to universities. Universities were for middle class and upper class Indians. Now they have started coming to the universities the war has started.</comment>

<comment>they have reservations everywhere what you mean by most dalits never went to univ?in that case all dalit positions in govt jobs should be vacant which is not the case.stop fooling around.yes the universities were started by rich ppl and you should be thankful these universities you get free education reservations etc.i have seen dalit poor boys coming in expensive cars to college and yet get reservation in admission, free educaton  and to top also scholarship .u shud be ashamed of yourself</comment>

<comment>You and your family should be ashamed of themselves. How dare you tell me to be ashamed, when you yourself are shameless and incapable of carrying on a conversation with out spewing filth..shameless idiot.Newpapers should stop the comment section. The shameless idiots like you spew filth.</comment>

<comment>you shoud be ashamed that even after 40 years of reservations and getting perks even though you are from well off family you still act like cry baby and the same you will teach to your kids that keep getting reservation and enjoy life , no need to work hard :) tax payers money will feed youwhat has me and my family done to  you?you should be ashamed that you are eating up benefits which some poor kids irrespective of caste deservewhy should comments section be stopped? just cause you felt bad about something?</comment>

<comment>What sick bakwasWhat made you think I am lower caste..my family has not taken a penny from corrupt Indian government, it is you corrupt low life  who has been benefiting form bribes and loot.You are one sick upper class idiot who thinks by virtue of birth he is superior and has right to abuse and judge..low life idiot. You shameless low life.Kabir, Nanak and many talked about your kind of shameless blood s uckers. comment sections should be stopped so that your kind of blood s ucker don't get a forum to use sick language and words such as  shame to bully others..Whole India including me has to ashamed for creating such a sick society. Look at the language your use and you are not fit be called civilized </comment>

<comment>LOL Bhadwe? doesnt matter which caste you are from shows your level :)Dont teach me what kabir and nanak thought but i hope they did not teach to call someone bhadwe if you do not agree with someone :) I dont beleive in any caste but I dont agree with any reservation other then those who are economically deprived</comment>

<comment>As far as i know... Dalits can get into universities easier than higher castes(with lesser marks) ... if dalit parents dont send their kids to study ... thats not sum1 else's fault</comment>

<comment>Higher castes are only 30 percent and they make 70 percent of the university population. it is fault of society that imposed thousands of years of slavery on them and denied them access to education...read history you may learn the truth.</comment>

<comment>yes ur still in history. pls grow up and come todays techno world where everybody equal. as per your muslims had looted and done attrocites on we hindus ,  so had we taken revenge with them... nhi na</comment>

<comment>You still are in the history. Get the current details of percentages. Come out of those old books with old math which were printed before Mandal commission . Go to a library than going through old books in your cupboard.</comment>

<comment>In any society ... those with more brains dominate those with less.. its god's rule.</comment>

<comment>After 40 years of reservation if a group of people are still complaining.... they need to think hard about what really is constraining them ... instead of blaming others</comment>

<comment>too good</comment>

<comment>Its the fault of creamy layer of lower castes(those getting the benefit of quota for generations) who monopolize the quota benefit given by govt.and deprive their uneducated poor brothers</comment>

<comment>Exactly...spot on ...dalits who have taken advantage of reservations .. are blocking the dalits who dont yet understand about reservations and laying the blame on upper castes</comment>

<comment>Actually these creamy layer guys got used to the protectionist environment and hate meritocracy and wouldn't even pass on the protection to those for which it was meant. Its time to form party for poor dalits separately. Mayawati who only collected bribes for her brother cannot represent them.</comment>

<comment>Spoken like a true higher castes who is worried that his superiority by birth is threatened by lowly bum lower castes.</comment>

<comment>Higher castes are not bothered about reservations ... rich dalits are the ones stopping poor dalits</comment>

<comment>Really..Is that the reason they constantly complain and  curse reservation</comment>

<comment>U didn't answer my question thought, did u? Now I am sure about ur class though despite ur crocodile tears for the lower class, u want to take all the benefits from them in the name of caste!</comment>

<comment>No crocodile tears just truth and fact as they are..You keep lying and trying to fool everybody. Anybody who travels to India can see how lower castes are treated.You have no right to ask me personal question, but brahmin in you thinks, you can ask most personal question with any hesitation and others are obliged to answer you..I am not going to do that, even if you abuse or insult, my personal life is none of your business.</comment>

<comment>U need 2 travel to India to see, We r in India and seeing. When I ask uncomfortable questions, ur response is talking about supposed superiority of Brahmins when u don't even know my caste. No wonder Smritiji asked "mera jaat bataao"</comment>

<comment>Your Smritiji is married to Parsi gentleman who is a divorcee and most Parsi's are  very well off. She herself said in an interview that her parents were Bengali and Punjabi and their middle class families rejected them. She is lying, she has talked about her middle class grand parents many times.Smiriti is very quarrelsome idiot she yells and has made mess of university and is dividing India. She has not done one thing to uplift India to make it strong, she and BJP are busy eroding Indian institutions.Kongress should dump the family and reformulate themselves.</comment>

<comment>Dont blame it on caste... open ur eyes .. debate on logic not on caste emotions</comment>

<comment>How many Brahmans have you seen cleaning gutters and streets of Delhi..Lying and making up stuff is special traits of Indians, that is one reason India will be in trouble. Keep pretending and lying to feel good.</comment>

<comment>I dont ask caste of people cleaning gutters...so id dont know... basically i am not bothered about people's castes ... not even my own .... when i see someone trapped in caste -mindset ...i pity them</comment>

<comment>You don't have to ask, you know they are banghi and they are not allowed to come to your house and sit on your sofa..How many of your friends or their family cleans gutters..</comment>

<comment>sorry man my good friends are also so called bhangi. we grow up together played together. without any difference. i had asked him while we were growing please do some other job but  he was not ready to do other job. mind you his father is in central govt. job</comment>

<comment>U make a lot of false assumptions..n lots of false statements...n either u r misguided..fed wrong facts.... or u r delusional</comment>

<comment>I am saying u need to give up ur reservation benefits for these poor gutter cleaners.</comment>

<comment>Why don't you give some rooms in your house and your car to some poor person..why do you think you need all this and you have right to preach me..Who died and gave you to tell me what to do</comment>

<comment>Its u who were preaching, but I took it in good faith that u want to do some good to the downtrodden, turned out u and ur ilk want to accumulate power and benefits in the name of these guys and keep them out of the benefits besides and u have the gall to preach the job and education ground has to be uneven in favor of ppl like u cornering benefits for generations!</comment>

<comment>Just out of curiosity, do you practice what you're preaching wherever you are? That is, do you share rooms and lend your car to homeless people in street? As I said, just asking out of curiosity.</comment>

<comment>I stick to my opinion, Rahul Gandhi is a Chutya (चुत्त्या) ... LOL</comment>

<comment>And i agree whole heartedly!!!</comment>

<comment>Who cares or Joker Rahul....he is a big asset to BJP</comment>

<comment>JNU students celebrated and debated Mahishasur Martyrdom Day calling Goddess Durga a prosti....   God forgive please forgive me. THis Commie ideology n their leaders should be burnt on streets. They have done enough damage already to the very spirit of India which is its ancient culture n philosophy so beautifully codified in Vedas and Puranas. One Kamlesh Tiwari is still languishing in jail for uttering some defeamatory words against prophet. why did not this Yechuri asked for his freedom of speech.</comment>

<comment>At which media home this news created ? fekuji ! ? </comment>

<comment>Just google mahishasur martyrdom day and you will know this was being organised by some all india backward students association belonging to these Left parties.</comment>

<comment>There are no commies left except some left out crumbs of kachori or carrot past their use before date. They're stinking, keep piggyback riding the congis, another parasitic group on the verge of extinction.</comment>

<comment>When seculars/congi/commie talk about tolerance... its tolerance of their views only... they r highly intolerant of other's views. Look at bengal/kerala under lefts ..no tolerance for talking anti-left... ur hands will b cut if not ur head... but then yechury will lecture on tolerance.According to them anti-minority is intolerant but anti-majority should be celebrated as secular/tolerance</comment>

<comment>Interest prevail - may you pl provide some more on its ? ! after 2014 howmany people killed for beef, intolerant ? ! You people under the leadership of some psycopath ripple india and blame others </comment>

<comment>Oh gosh, and you people can sell the country. Oh sorry, I forgot, you faggots don't believe in country. You guys believe in equality of income by stealing money from others or even killing others for the fact. you can't stand when someone wishes to bring jobs to your fellow citizens so that they can lead a life. No wonder, you all believe in biased ideologies and pretend to know the original ideology which was so better in reality.</comment>

<comment>Great speech but again why is Smriti hesitant to clean JNU n other left loony places and make history textbooks free from antihindu references....we voted BJP for ideological reasons and that must be delivered !! Make every Hindu kid proud of their history and highlight how Marathas screwed mughals !! Speeches are fine but real action needed !</comment>

<comment>The moment she starts cleaning up the campus, you will call her an intolerant Hindu blah blah blah and tweet it all over. That will bring the nation to a boil. We have come to this pass by letting somebody rule for 60 years and change its history to suit its designs. Changing it overnight to a neutral gear from reverse will need the nation to come to a standstill. In any case that cannot be achieved with out your unequivocal support. So let the Sibals and Teestas of the world continue teaching our kids and we bear the brunt of our follies in our old age hopefully in this country if it remains so then.</comment>

<comment>Who the heck is she to clear up the campus, has she ever been to one to even learn critical thinking.</comment>

<comment>Sasbhi kavi bahu thi - finest actress, no doubt . Why have you not interfere before suicide ? why they were driven out by abvp ! </comment>

<comment>History should seek truth and we should present all the arguments backed by facts for ppl to draw conclusion</comment>

<comment>Pride is against spiritual development, the essence of Hinduism. Or so I'm told.</comment>

<comment>Madam Smritiji - Nobody is seeking your caste.  All that the Nation  wants  to know is whether you have forged your educational qualifications by lying in the EC Affidavit,  which if true  certainly doesn't behove of the position you now hold as the Country's HRD Minister, a critical Ministry which shapes the future of the youth of this Country and imagine the kind of precedent you set for the youth when a person steering the Ministry forges her own educational qualification !?Why can't you dwell on this aspect and clear the misapprehensions on this count which is crucial as it sends a wrong message to the Country's youth.  The fact is that you showed two different qualifications when you contested from Delhi and Amethi !!Isn't the Nation justified in atleast knowing the educational antecedents of their Education Minister ?You have proved to be a good rhetorician.  Now the time has come for you to stand upto the charge that you are confronted with and clear the air of confusion.  Reasoning is all that matters in a debate and not mere rants as you have reveled in  might at best  appeal to the fire brands and motor mouths within your party and the faithfuls in the social networking sites !!</comment>

<comment>u must coach d opposition, especially raul baba. if only he had ur clarity of vision?????</comment>

<comment>Wish this country get rids of these pppls... Right from:Zyonia, Pappu, few Congi chamchaas.. then Mayawati, Mamata, CPI,M,N,O,Ps....

<comment>We should also put you on that plane to guantanamo bay, we don't want intolerant people who don't want rule living among us.</comment>

<comment>No attempt was made to revive him. No police was allowed to go near him till 6.30 next morning.If these were facts, there must be a thorough investigation into it. Who needed Rohit dead? Whose strategic interests are most served by the suicide of Rohit? Since spotting Rohit hanging, what communications happened, by what mode, to whom etc. etc. A serious investigation involving all digital & non-digital information networks must be undertaken to identify the person(s) responsible for the delay or negation of the medical intervention.</comment>

<comment>Nobody will try to find out, BJP is busy finding who Desh Bakht and using police to jail people beat people who are not BJP's Bakhts.What a mess, I was very happy that modi has one, I had no idea that these people are as bad as Kongress, even worse in some ways.</comment>

<comment>Jis mustaidi se smriti ne RS mein bola (as per paid journos like this one), uska aadha zor bhi wo apne kaam mein daalti to ye jawab dene ki naubat na aati.</comment>

<comment>She comes across as illiterate idiot uses, yelling, abuses and emotions and lies instead of argument and logic.</comment>

<comment>How frequently do u go to rss headquarter?</comment>

<comment>Quiet energetic willing to satisfy maya 🙄</comment>

<comment>Grapes are sour for Firstpost. I challenge you firstpost to go and face Smriti. She will rip you apart. Do u want to be in line with ABP, NDTV and Aaj Tak whom whole of India have rejected?</comment>

<comment>they are worse than them</comment>

<comment>Mother of Rohit Vemula is sometimes seen with Kejriwal and sometimes she sits with Rahul. What is going on. Why no chance to Commies too</comment>

<comment>Rohit didnt want his suicide to be politicized... but Rahul gandhi is doing exactly that ... and also by highlighting this as a dalit issue ..hez creating divide in society ... then he is claiming hez a messiah of the dalit/poor ... ha ha ha ha</comment>

<comment>Rahul lays claim to many things, if people were to take his every claim serious then they are done for.</comment>

<comment>I did the same with the BJP. Don't see it much different.</comment>

<comment>U r right ... all politicians are scum ...  but any party clinging to power for long time .. makes them complacent .. they think they can get away with anything .. 2G..coalG...CWG ... minority appeasement ... sycophancy ... a change was required</comment>

<comment>Cool. But the majority of India differs with you and India is a democracy. </comment>

<comment>And you did this survey, when?</comment>

<comment>Last elections. </comment>

<comment>I'm talking about after elections Sir. BJP fooled me also.</comment>

<comment>India is a democracy and BJP got 5 years to prove. You gave 60 years to one family hijacked party who looted us in last 10 years. I don't see BJP looting us instead I see a very hardworking PM and non corrupt ministers like Manohar or Prabhu working very hard. It takes time to turn around such a large country which was heading for disaster. Even in BRICS, I for India under BJP is doing far better. We are as much part of the global economy whether we like it or not. I don't see any symptoms of BJP fooling us and I think the majority of Indians do not see to think that way. Off course we have higher hopes from BJP and we hope it steps up even higher.</comment>

<comment>I see a contradiction therein. Leaving apart congress failures, people are praising the BJP even before it's tenure is over and then when asked what results are produced, they say 'Wait for the tenure to be over".I hope too it steps higher too. But let's keep the praise for then.</comment>

<comment>I don't understand why are you finding faults with people praising BJP before their tenure is over. Just like you have a right to your opinion people in a democracy also has a right to their opinions. People who are praising are also finding faults people like you with BJP which is what a democracy enables. But to be honest if BJP is doing a good job why not praise and encourage them after being looted by a family hijacked party for 60 years? If Suresh Prabhu Manohar Irani Gadkari all are working very hard with PM Modi who works 16 hours a day and no corruption charge against him why not appreciate people's vote and faith they had in a non corrupt hard working good administration of Mr. Modi? </comment>

<comment>Jo abne dharm ka nahi hua wo desh ki bat karte hain.</comment>

<comment>Politics,Gender studies,Humanities,Sociology,Political studies,Urdu...........should be thrown out of academic schools.They dont deserve to be studied for getting a degree.</comment>

<comment>Depends on the methods applied rather. Most engineers don't even deserve their degree either.</comment>

<comment>Most engineers dont deserve the degree.I agree without a doubt.What I am saying is all the above subjects dont even deserve to be studied to get a degree.See the difference?Engineering is a subject to be studied.Its a different matter that most students dont study it with interest but the fields I mentioned dont deserve to be studied in the first place.</comment>

<comment>Ok, though just surprised you didn't put an MBA on the list. That is even more trivial than any of these fields.</comment>

<comment>Yup, especially when they get admission based on reservation rather than merit. They surely don't deserve their degree.</comment>

<comment>Man! Do you have to peddle your caste agenda everywhere?</comment>

<comment>Sir, you've misunderstand my point. And it's not my agenda, rather sad and bitter thruth of our country at this moment.</comment>

<comment>Ok fair enough, I don't disagree. But I didn't see the relevance to what I was saying.</comment>

<comment>Topic for next "man ki Baat", madam ko gussa kyo aata hai?</comment>

<comment>You may just want to look over your shoulder to make sure that your boss is not seeing you waste office hours spewing nonsense.</comment>

<comment>The way Smriti Irani did her home work before facing the challenge, if had been followed by the Professors & other faculty in our universities; millions of students from Americas & Europe or even from China would have got enrolled in our universities every year. I really admire her way of understanding the problem and finding the solution that works.</comment>

<comment>You obviously have not seen the level of higher education in universities abroad. Do some homework yourself before commenting.</comment>

<comment>Specially JNU professors... who teaches politics rather than academic subjects</comment>

<comment>Politics is an academic subject is universities abroad. Apparently.</comment>

<comment>Not in a history class</comment>

<comment>Or arts class</comment>

<comment>Will you please  elaborate regarding your qualification?</comment>

<comment>U have a job to offer?No thanks ... i am very happy with my present one.</comment>

<comment>What? Politics is not an academic subject in an Arts class?</comment>

<comment>Politics is not even a subject.Take it easy.</comment>

<comment>Look above, re read my statement and then reply.</comment>

<comment>JNU professors..teaching politics in pol science class is okay...but JNU profs ...teaching politics(polluting young minds with commie world view and spreading hatred against BJP) in literature class...or music class means they r interested in politics..not academics</comment>

<comment>"I feel ashamed of being Indian" that's what Modi ji said standing on foreign land, what kind of patriotism is this?</comment>

<comment>Right kind of! Every person flying abroad still feels ashamed because of scams of congress!</comment>

<comment>Bank shares reduced to 10 times, but no one wants to talk on that, wah Modi ji ka jawab nahi..</comment>

<comment>That is because Modi has dared to clean UPA's house and go after the crony capitalists protected by the UPA</comment>

<comment>Bullshit... thats becoz of previous congress policy of giving bad loans to boot-lickers that accumulated bad debts for banks</comment>

<comment>Industrial growth at all time low, but no one wants to talk on that, wah Modi ji ka jawab nahi..</comment>

<comment>Industrial growth in India is pretty good compared to rest of the world.... it depends on world economic situation</comment>

<comment>Lol Industrial growth was overestimated to present overall higher growth. That's why almost no statistician was happy with the tweaked numbers.</comment>

<comment>You forgot the recent IMF report that validates the GDP numbers.</comment>

<comment>Link? I'm interest to read.</comment>

<comment>http://www(dot)dnaindia(dot)com/money/report-india-s-gdp-numbers-dependable-rigging-not-possible-with-regards-to-data-kaushik-basu-2177632This validation, the projection of IMF that is in sync with govt. projection is,http://timesofindia(dot)indiatimes(dot)com/business/india-business/Indias-GDP-to-grow-at-7-3-in-current-fiscal-IMF/articleshow/50639870(dot)cms</comment>

<comment>Ok, the link is what Kaushik Basu said, not an IMF report. Also that's the growth rate target for the coming year. Time will tell, what the actual number is. And I hope, like you that it's positive.</comment>

<comment>Kausik Basu, chief economist at world bank, not govt. chamcha. U would have known if u bothered 2 read!The projection is for 2015 only, if u have a brain u will realise 2015 ends at March</comment>

<comment>Abbe idiot, you said it's an IMF report. That's what he said in an interview. Since you have no brain, you don't know what you're talking about. The IMF report is a growth target. A quick google search revealed the relevant IMF report. Read the DNA article, "IMF retains India GDP forecast at 7.5 for FY17.."FY17.</comment>

<comment>And a quick study of the TOI link  reveals forecast for 2015-16 fiscal was also included in the paper! and lo and behold its exactly what the GOI says.</comment>

<comment>I said the first link was for validation, though it was a validation by World bank, sister bank of IMF.The second link is a projection for fiscal 2015 which is in sync with what govt. is saying.But u r the one that is taking an issue about IMF or world bank which is what commies do to distract from real issues. What does it matter who validated, if the numbers were validated as truth by a credible and impartial authority?</comment>

<comment>Ok, first slow down. You're getting things mixed up. The IMF validated the FY17 predictions not the numbers for 15-16. From the TOI link itself,"The CSO revised its method of calculating GDP a year ago, and some analysts say the current series is overstating real growth by as much as two percentage points. The volatile inflation or deflation figure applied to the nominal GDP numbers to arrive at real growth adds to the problem."The second link says exactly what the government in saying, there is no mention of IMF validating these figures in the link. Look at the figure, the IMF estimates were conducted on other countries, while for India, China and the US they are the presented actual figures as per the government data.And talking of commies, why are quoting from the sickular media? Don't you hate it?</comment>

<comment>That the numbers are not true is also an opinion, but the new method of GDP calculation is also in sync with global method, those same ppl agree. What Basu is saying is that there was no intentional manipulation..</comment>

<comment>I didn't say there is intentional manipulation, but rather that there is a faulty method used. This is a position still held by many statisticians. I was referring to the FY 16 -17 predictions in my initial post, and I said before I hope these numbers are reached. Also, most calculations are performed locally by each central office. The validation comes only from eventual results. If the IMF says the numbers are accurate, I rest my case. They know better.</comment>

<comment>Indias-GDP-to-grow-at-7-3-in-current-fiscal-IMFThis line is even on the link!</comment>

<comment>My apologies for the misquote, the link you pasted didn't open and redirected me to another FT link. My quote in the above link was from the FT article, which I thought you directed me to.</comment>

<comment>Chill man!! Eat chocolateSTUDY REVEALS WHY CHOCOLATE IS HEALTHY FOR YOUR BRAINNo more feeling guilty about that chocolate intake.If good taste wasn't reason enough for you to go gaga over chocolates, then here is another one. A new study has suggested that indulging in a daily chocolate habit could be all it takes for a better-working brain.The study, conducted by researchers at the University of South Australia, University of Maine and the Luxembourg Institute of Health, found that chocolate consumption improved cognitive performance "irrespective of other dietary habits".Researchers looked at data collected during an earlier study in which residents of Syracuse, New York, were measured for dietary intake and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Participants were also given a series of tests designed to measure cognitive function.They said that more frequent chocolate consumption was significantly associated with better performance on tests, including Visual-Spatial Memory and Organisation, Working Memory, Scanning and Tracking, Abstract Reasoning, and the Mini-Mental State Examination, adding that with the exception of Working Memory, these relations were not attenuated with statistical control for cardiovascular, lifestyle and dietary factors.The study suggested that regular chocolate intake could help "protect against normal age-related cognitive decline". They also note that chocolate has historically been used to "reduce fever, treat childhood diarrhoea, promote strength before sexual conquests, decrease "female complaints", increase breast-milk production, encourage sleep and to clean teeth.The study is published in the journal Appetite</comment>

<comment>Rahul ne #JNU ke used condom apni munh mein laga rakha tha.</comment>

<comment>LoL</comment>

<comment>She just fought against Rahul Gandhi.So,she is being abused like no other woman with crudest form of language.No woman in politics has faced such vitriol and abuse.BJP described Indira Gandhi as a goddess but Cong and its media goons are attacking her without an ounce of class.Imagine if she defeats Rahul Gandhi in Amethi.</comment>

<comment>great!! is the same Durga what Atal bihari vajpeyi praised is also same as mentioned in the mahishasur martyr dom day episode? what is cong's response to this?</comment>

<comment>With a speech like that, we won't have to imagine for too long I think.</comment>

<comment>People have short term memories and Cong is the most vicious party in the whole world.They can even divide the country if they can get few minority votes.Never take them lightly.And they are just warming up.</comment>

<comment>Compared to how well the BJP has divided Hindus?</comment>

<comment>Why do you care?You are not even a Hindu.Take care of your own community first.</comment>

<comment>According to the RSS, Hindu is anyone from the Indian subcontinent. Not so Hindoo?</comment>

<comment>So,you agree to that interpretation?</comment>

<comment>Not really. Do you?</comment>

<comment>Then,why are you even mentioning it if you dont believe in that?</comment>

<comment>Because I thought you did, you supposed Hindoo agnostic.</comment>

<comment>You give them too much credit.  They are surviving because of deep pockets.  But that may not work for them for eternity.</comment>

<comment>They are surviving because of 60 years of investment they made in building soft power in universities and conferring awards on unworthy movies stars-directors giving plum posts to morons in universities,Kala Kshetras,cultural institutions and by grooming journalists.You see,they are not a party.They are full on mafia styled institution.The full effect of 10 years of Cong rule is not seen yet.In military preparedness,in capacity addition, subjugation of national interests in favour of political families.........Dear,you have only  seen the tail of Cong's treachery.The full head of this is going to come out soon.And I am not exaggerating.</comment>

<comment>You maybe right, but you forget who is at the helm now, Rahul.  Nature has its way of creating things, destroying them and restoring balance, nothing is beyond its reach.  It has given Rahul to Congress, he will take care of its destruction.</comment>

<comment>Again,sorry to say you are taking this as a fight between Cong-BJP.No dear,This is not a fight between parties.Establishment is not Cong here.Cong is just a face or Sonia-Rahul are just faces of this onslaught on Hindu society.The establishment of this entire 'secularism' is the confluence of what Hindus callMlechcha-marUnmattAbhisamdhi.If you know that phrase,no need for me to explain it further.</comment>

<comment>The minister also quoted from another poster Mahisasur Martyrdom which went on to the extent of calling Goddess Durga as a "sex worker" for tricking Mahisasur into marriage and slaying him later.is this spreading love?</comment>

<comment>Where have you cooked up this story from? You should start acting in movies and the Hindi movies now do encourage such silly scripts, though you stand no chance in quality films!</comment>

<comment>All Nautanki by Smriti Irani.Read what Rohiths Mother has to say....The words of Radhika: "I want to meet Smriti Irani and ask her 'On what basis did you declare my son to be anti-national? Your Ministry had written that my Rohith and other Dalit students were anti-national extremists. You said that he is not a Dalit. You accused him of getting a false certificate. Should I say it is because you got false certificates for your educational qualifications that you think others do so too? You stopped my son's stipend, you got him suspended from the university. You are the Minister for HRD, but you have no value for education. You can never understand how difficult it is for a Dalit to reach the stage of doing his PhD. You can never imagine the hardship, the struggle, the tears and sacrifice to reach that position. In three months, you destroyed what it had taken me 26 years to build. I am talking about my Rohith, he died at the age of 26.'"</comment>

<comment>Jaykumar ter aukad kya ?  tu be aik nautanki ka beta hai kya?Listen what Rohit's father said ... he said his son's friends were the cause of his death.  What do you have to say for it?What you said about Rohit's mother is what the politician made out?</comment>

<comment>You can never understand how difficult it is for a Dalit [Guru and Yakub Memom's supporter] to reach the stage of doing his PhD [politics]....</comment>

<comment>He has written in his suicidal note no one is responsible for his death. And now he is dead cong AAP is using his dead body for their political advantage.. why dont you guys understand this ? They just want a reason to disrupt another parliament session.</comment>

<comment>lol who said rohit was anti ntional? he was physco... he was suspended from univ due to misbehaviour  there was no seiditon charge on him</comment>

<comment>Oh he was killed in Kashmir fighting with militent, may be these congies have murdered him for political milage</comment>

<comment>Did Rohit named HRD Minister in her suicide note, his mother is used by political parites.</comment>

<comment>Yes, all dalits are stupid. only you are smart to figure that out.</comment>

<comment>Dalit card, this is the real politics about Rohith Vemula. Reason for Two visit by Ra Ga to Hyderabad, but not one for Hanupathappa.</comment>

<comment>There u are... using ur caste to create division... then u will say ..upper castes divide</comment>

<comment>Rohit didnt want his suicide to be politicized ... respect that</comment>

<comment>So, you know more about Rohith than his mother ?</comment>

<comment>No.. congress knows more about him than his mother..That letter was for their political advantage.</comment>

<comment>Sometimes mother in there blind love for son don't know the true facts, her son was supporter of Yakub Memon and other destructive activities in University. He has beaten fellow student and got suspended.</comment>

<comment>Its written in his suicide letter .. moron... know ur facts ..then come to debate</comment>

<comment>The minister forgot that Congress/Paid Media/Commies/Seculars are shameless.... no amount of debate/reason will satisfy them... this group is hurt because they have been thrown out of power ... unless they get back the power .. they will keep disrupting/sloganeering etc. They have never bothered about national interest.</comment>

<comment>FOREIGN INVESTORS RUSH TO INDIA, SAYS FEKKU ONLY ! THE REALITY ? READ THIS :  The New York Times :India’s Crackdown on DissentBy THE EDITORIAL BOARD FEB. 22, 2016India is in the throes of a violent clash between advocates of freedom of speech and the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and its political allies on the Hindu right determined to silence dissent. This confrontation raises serious concerns about Mr. Modi’s governance and may further stall any progress in Parliament on economic reforms.The crisis began with the arrest of Kanhaiya Kumar, the president of Jawaharlal Nehru University’s student union, by the Delhi police on charges of sedition. Mr. Kumar’s arrest followed an on-campus rally on Feb. 9 that marked the anniversary of the 2013 hanging of Muhammad Afzal, who was convicted of participating in the 2001 terrorist attack by an Islamist group based in Pakistan on India’s Parliament. The circumstances of Muhammad Afzal’s trial and execution remain controversial.The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, a student group affiliated with Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, and new university leadership appointed by Mr. Modi’s government were involved in calling the police on campus and singling out Mr. Kumar.The court in New Delhi where Mr. Kumar’s hearing took place last week was a scene of chaos, as lawyers and B.J.P. supporters chanting “glory to Mother India” and “traitors leave India” assaulted journalists and students.
