<comment>Anyone who can see the real thing will know - AK is Aurgangzeb of the new era, he is going to finish anyone who comes in his way.. he finished Anna, Prashant Bhushan and Yadav.. and interesting is Ashutosh and Ashish Khaitan know this.. with AK's deteriorating health, New Aurangzeb will be in making in Ashutosh and Ashish Khaitan.. who knows AK needs to have protection from these two very soon..</comment>

<comment>When Kejriwal first took on the political class during Anna movement, they  called him an outsider who has no right to question elected politicians. When AAP was formed they dismissed as it as a nonentity. When Kejriwal questioned the misdeeds of Vadra, Ambani, Khurshid etc, they branded him shoot and scoot guy, hit and run guy etc with the help of paid media.. When he protested against high electricity bills, he was called a Law breaker who doesn’t respect constitution.  When he decided to contest against Sheila he was called a Fool and idiot.. When he promised free water and electricity they called him unrealistic. leftist, communist and anti-industry.When AAP won 28 seats in Delhi assembly, they called it a Fluke. Whey AAP decided to form Govt, he was called a cheat, U-turn king,  Congress B-team head, Sonia agent and so on. When he protested for woman safety they called him urban Naxal, Maoist, Anarchist, Disruptionist, and Dharna man. He was also branded khap supporter, Jihadi supporter, Kashmiri terrorist supporter, racist,  anti-national, US agent, Pakistan agent, ISI agent, Vatican agent, Ford foundation agent.. and so on. When he resigned they branded him Irresponsible, Coward and Bhagoda.When he decided to contest against Modi he was branded Selfish, Opporutunist and Power greedy. When AAP won 4 seats in LS elections, he was written off and branded as a finished entity.  When he won Delhi again by a historic margin 67-3, they started calling Delhi people itself as fools and branded Delhi itself as a municipality. When he delivered on free water and electricity they called him an Ignorant who doesn’t know about economy. When a farmer committed suicide they branded him Insensitive, Murderer and Conspirator. When Kejriwal questioned Modi for snatching ACB from Delhi government they called him confrontationist and obstructionist. When Kejriwal questioned LG for declaring Delhi govt orders null and void they branded him mental patient and his actions unconstitutional.When Kejriwal constructed mohalla clinics, poly clinics public toilets etc they called him Nautankibaaz. When Kejriwal constructed flyovers by hundreds of crores less than the allocated amount they called it drama. When he passed whistle blower protection bill, citizens charter, right to service bill, Janlokpal bill etc they called him cheater and dramabaaz. When he talked about odd-even scheme he was again called an idiot and fool and was branded second Mohammed bin Tuqlak. When ink was thrown at Kejriwal they again called him dramabaaz. Now when AAP is tipped to win Punjab elections they have started calling him Bhindranwale supporter.BJP leaders, their paid media and paid trolls keep giving Kejriwal new new names every day. Their deep frustration is evident from the fact that they don’t even spare Kejriwals muffler and cough as a reason to criticise him. Since Kejriwal came to power,. people of Delhi are tasting the fruits of better civic services, concern for aam aadmi, better governance, responsive govt officials and more citizen friendly policies and hence are very much satisfied with the functioning of Kejriwal govt. Kejriwal and AAP should ignore the daily rants of BJP leaders, paid media and trolls and march forward undeterred.</comment>

<comment>I wish that AAP wins in Punjab. The whole world will know what AAP is made of. AAPtards will go in hiding - due to non performance of AAP.</comment>

<comment>Where is their so call Jokepal bill bacause of which they came to power ?</comment>

<comment>They came to power so why bring in anything more.. now enjoy for 5 yrs.. AK has successfully transformed IAC into a profitable political party while still have the sugar coating of "Main hoon Aam Admi" while there is nothing aam in AK or his cadres anymore.. they all are already wealthy and on the mission of becoming next big and rich party..</comment>

<comment>AAP MLA's give themselves a heavy increment1) 400% increase in salary2) 100% increase in lifelong pension.3) 500% increase in conveyance allowance4) 300,000 travel package every year5) 100% increase in daily allowance6) 650 crores spent on khujli shining advertisements and no money to pay for workers !</comment>

<comment>I am truly amazed at the depth of Kejriwal's friendship with the accused IAS Officer Rajendra Kumar. The extent to which Kejriwal is going, to defend Kumar, his IIT classmate, room mate, Civil Services batch-mate and presently close confidante & Principal Secretary, is truly the stuff legends are made off - a very close relationship. And we are amused to see the likes of so called Intellectuals such as Ashutosh, Sanjay Singh, Raghav Chadda etc., going out of the way to defend Rajendra Kumar even before he can be deemed to be innocent or guilty!!!!!! yeh to AAP nahin, corruption ka baap hain ! CBI raid on principal secretary office was a shock for him !</comment>

<comment>AK-49 was heard crying "Modiji aap ko pata nahin main kis mitti se bana hoon ! " People of Delhi replied Abe AK-49 humein pata hain ki tum to Suver ki tatti se bana ho because the whole Delhi is stinking with filth !``</comment>

<comment>AK has no money to pay workers but has waived off the electricity, telephone and water bills of Jumma masjid of Delhi which is approximately 10 crores. AAPtards want to consolidate secular votes to make khujli pm in 2019, AAP is the najayaz aulad of congress and there is no difference between the two !</comment>

<comment>CM of half a state Delhi is the pre$$titute media's favourite. There are CMs of big states, very hard working and coming up with innovative ideas like Devendra Fadnavis of Maharashtra, Biju Patnaik, Shivraj Singh, Raman Singh, Vasundhara Raje, Raghubar Das, Tripura and Pondicherry CMS, CHandra babu naidu, Goa cm, Gujarat and haryana CMs but the sold out 89% corrupt media ignore them and highlight the only scheme till now -odd even rule which will fail as everyone will purchase and have an odd and even number vehicle at home. Delhi is just half a state and its CM thinks that the tail can wag and control the dog !. People of India are shocked how the Indian media selectively censors good work of Modi and highlights Khujli !-- Khujli is the dalal of automobile company owners !</comment>

<comment>The Congress sting is useless as it is a random person shown who is neither close to the minister of AAP in question nor one known in AAP circles. Hence, media, which never misses a chance to shout out at AAP, has dropped the issue within hours of announcing. Rajender Kumar issue is a non-starter since after 60 hours of questioning by CBI and many more bureaucrats called and interrogated no charge-sheet is against him and no objectionable things were found against him. These tactics won't go a long way. BJP and Congress have to concentrate on politics and reach out to people rather than fighting such fights through media and CBI. No gains through these. After Bassi retires this month and LG next year early, and MCDs won by AAP in Delhi, Centre will have to settle down to peaceful co-existence.</comment>

<comment>After this, that, and then.. Prof.. you seem to have really sold your ethics.. glad i was taught by better people than yourself.. I'm amazed how you are out there to spread and re-enforce the lies spread by AK.. BTW.. do you know another AAP MLA Mahinder Yadav was arrested in a case of rioting, damaging public property and stopping public servants from performing their duty.AAP is only there to trouble common people for their petty political gains.. wonder how come a learned prof doesn't see all the drama that AAP does and preaches their theory to the world.. what a sad day it is for Indian education system when a Guru seem to have sold his soul a petty political party..</comment>

<comment>Delhi people have lost interest in Delhi police arrests. Two MLAs already freed by Court earlier rebuking the Police. For every protest on behalf of people in case of a molestation or other crimes, Delhi Police puts such cases for a few days, and then court rebukes the Police. It is now considered as just an occupational hazard by AAP.</comment>

<comment>Can't there be like a national referendum or vote to decide if or not Delhi politics and Delhi BS keeps getting splashed across national TV and media?Sick of knowing more about Kejriwal's everyday crap from his muffler to his cough to his bloody itinerary to an un-important odd-even rule that isn't applicable to 99.9% of India's population.Some of us have had enough.And its pretty offensive for say people from the south when no national media network decides to show news from here. Aren't we part of India too?I cant even imagine how people from the North east would feel.</comment>

<comment>Media (congress) made AK - against Modi. Now congress is gone, but they still own the media - google it and you will see who owns which channel. So they are still making AK hero (despite not doing any work). Prof is just of the AAPtards. Where is the Janlokpal Bill which was the reason for them to come to power. It has been termed as Jokpal bill by ex-AAP team. AK and team are a big joke for Delhi and for the country.</comment>

<comment>That exactly is the purpose. Keep anti AAP talks in media alive. Paint AK non performer. Do not allow bureaucrats, police, land, laws, inquiries, ACB, administrative space etc to AAP govt and try to show it a non performer. And thereby kill the four years wonder called AAP. No party has come to power in one state in two years, and is now poised to rule another in 4th year. Hence, this is the strategy of media funded by corporates who have reasons to be anti AAP, Centre which wants to see AAP die a political death and by a class of intellectuals threatened by the change of the status quo. But shall NOT happen. Odd-Even showed public support in Delhi. MCDs polls will see AAP re-elected in Delhi. Punjab, followed by Uttarakhand, will show AAP expansion.</comment>

<comment>Wonder called AAP??? really.. yes well.. its true only.. everyone is just "Wondering" about "AAP" and thinking why the hell we voted for them...</comment>

<comment>Who is this everyone except the Bhakts? Many channels and papers in the last two days asked Delhi people whom they will vote if there are polls now. Still AAP is the choice of a vast majority. If you guys have any doubts, check the media of these days, and call for MCD polls. You will be in for a rude shock.</comment>

<comment>Be that as it may Professor. But honestly, AAP has a long long way to go to become national. Even despite Haryana Punjab and Delhi being strengthened under their fold.They tried remember?, and failed. And if you ask me, AAP has now ignored the other states. They had some sort of a footing in MH, but they had to shut shop. Karnataka too.AAP just does not matter to us. I want to know what's happening in the South, what's happening in India as a whole. Not just internal Delhi crap which I don't care about.The kind of front page plastering that the odd even rule got was ridiculous. </comment>

<comment>You are completely right. Media ignores other parts of the country. More than south, the Northeast. Though South is reflected in English media, but poor in Hindi media. As for AAP, I think NOW the strategy is better: focus on one task at a time and succeed. Knowing a few people in AAP, I can vouch they DO NOT enjoy the over-focus on them in Delhi, and almost always negatively by the media. It is a media-need due to many factors: money and corporate pressures to show AAP in poor light, TRP, visibility, easy target etc etc that they focus on AAP overwhelmingly.</comment>

<comment>AAP wants the media to throw light, action, and camera on them.. afterall don't forget AAP is lead by biggest Megalomaniac.. he recently cried "77 of my people" are harassed by CBI..dont you see his trick, he could've said 75 or 80.. but no.. he said 77 just to show how true he is while he is only painting lies all across.. and worst of all You are supporting him.</comment>

<comment>You dream, drink, eat and talk about AK it seems. These are 77 officers of Delhi govt (civil service officers) and not AAP workers. And they have been called by CBI and interrogated which is officially recorded. Rajendra Kumar, his OSD, interrogated more than 60 hours. Still no charges, no FIR, no evidences.</comment>

<comment>But remember Professor. It was the media and only the media that created the AAP sensation. It was the media that made Kejriwal famos along with Anna's  campaign against corruption.Media is all powerful in this country. I just wish they realized that they have a national obligation towards the whole country and not just one segment of polity.</comment>

<comment>bhakts and Congis in for rude awakening in Punjab polls. Good luck Kejriwal!!!</comment>

<comment>most of their decisions are shot down by courts like school admission rules. Most of the decision and blaming Centre govt are not as per laid rules.  It is surprising School Admission was discussed so much but when court shot it down ,no media bother to focus. it shows the bias of media</comment>

<comment>If bjp/Modiji were so concerned about our soldiers and army, they wouldn't have made them cry for OROP. This govt has forced none other than our army to do andolan. और अब घडियाली आँसू बहाकर नज़र रख रहे हैं कि कौन कौन रोया!</comment>

<comment>Typical APPtards. No words on AAP achievements and keep blaming others. They live happily under congress rule for 60 years. No problems there. OROP was a problem for last 60 years - where were the AAPtards then. Sick of these people - dirty politics even on a soldier's death.</comment>

<comment>Entire nation is mourning our brave soldier...u r idiot to link that with this news....can I ask why u r commenting and mourning and crying in memories of Lance Naik..</comment>

<comment>Now even whole money from Gulf be pumped in for Kaijriwal ,this cheat can not escape from general public criticism.</comment>

<comment>You forgot or didnt want to mention that AK was the main brains behind the  MGNREGA and RTE .  AK was instrumental in defeating the corrupt congress all over the country and particularly in Delhi.  Land Aquisition bill and Food security act was also his idea.

<comment>1. Kejriwal claims the media is under control of modi and it is against him. But everyone saw him fixing interview with AAJ Tak journalist Punya Prasun Bajpai.https://www. youtube .com/watch?v=q6uvh35v_3k2. Initially denied taking 4Lakh USD from Ford foundation, later accepted and then denied again. Ford foundation is involved in funding many NGO's for Anti Indian work.- Firstpost asked about $ 4Lakh donation from Ford Foundation then Arvind asked for proof:http://www. firstpost. com/politics/annas-movement-a-copy-of-world-bank-agenda-arundhati-roy-72824.html- Later Kejriwal accepted, taking 4Lakh USD from the Ford Foundation in a Business Standard interview:http://www. business-standard. com/article/economy-policy/claims-that-hazare-s-movement-is-us-funded-baseless-arvind-111083100109_1.html- Later again took U Turn and said he has not taken any foreign funding of 4Lakh USD:https://www .youtube .com/watch?v=653E1S9C9SE3.

He sent letters to Anna saying that all money received during Anna movement spent during the movement and no money left. Later he accepted that 2 Crore rupees still left of the movement. He never disclosed the actual sum he got away with, which is estimated to be well above 100Crores made from sales of crores of Anna cards.6. Nirbhaya issue - On one hand Kejriwal did protests in Delhi on camera asking for justice for Nirbhaya and strict punishment for rapists. But on the other, he gave Loksabha ticket from south Bangalore to Nina P. Nayak. Nina supported and easy sentence for the Nirbahya Killer and most brutal rapist Muhammad Afroz. It was Muhammad Afroz who double raped Nirbhaya, inserted Iron rot (wheel jack) in her body, took out her intestines. Because of brutal assault by Afroz, Nirbhaya died. Arvind Kejriwal gave justice to Nirbhaya by giving Loksabha ticket to saviour of her rapist and murderer.http://www. thehansindia .com/posts/index/2013-09-01/8216Most-brutal8217-juvenile-convict-gets-3-years-707347.

<comment>which of the above statement is false. Can you specify?</comment>

<comment>It  seems the dirty tricks department of BJP is spending sleepless nights thinking about how to counter the rise of this honest man Kejriwal who is fighting fiercely for a Corruption Free India…. In India political parties feed from Corruption… therefore  it is no wonder  that  Kejriwal and AAP has become the number one enemy of all political parties.!!!</comment>

<comment>16. Ford Foundation is known for funding many, if not all, anti national activities in India (Some, of course, are genuine). Ford foundation is known as a CIA front agency. Arvind Kejriwal's own NGO Kabir got registered on12 Nov 2007 but 2 years before in 2005 Kabir got 44 Lakhs from the ford foundation, in 2006 got 32 Lakhs. Kabir foundation started getting money 2 Yrs before its foundation.https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=7u2gINKaDBE17.

However, many UP candidates, even including few AAP founders on camera said there is high command culture in AAP and only top 4-5 leaders decide everything.http://www. youtube .com/watch?v=YbiWLvl2eAA   (Arvind says no high command culture in party)http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=hrlSsf-c7kQ   (AAP MLA Vinod Binny explains why Kejriwal is a dictator)19. During the AAP meeting he said on camera that he will send all media people to Jail. He was not aware that there was a recording going on camera. Then when Media asked him about it he lied and he said he never said such things. He told the media how he can say such things to Media?https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=kgGAVyU7dQU20. Kejriwal said his leaders will not take government residence. But after becoming CM of Delhi he himself sent a letter and requested for allotment of two Bungalows each of 5 rooms.http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=EfkL3ECvxg021.

We all know Bhiujju Maharat who was a negotiator between Team Anna and Indian congress during Anna movement. We all saw him on tv (you can search on YouTube for videos).

Just for example Gujarat has been the only state in India where there is 24x7 electricity in every village.https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=MUWR3ibuoyA27. Before talking about Corruption by Robert Vadra Arvind Kejriwal said he could not find anything wrong about Sonia and Priyanka. But there are already proofs submitted by Dr Swamy about Corruption of Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka.https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=vV8DxIyUMIk28. Anna's ex-blogger Raju Parulekar accused Arvind Kejriwal for a scam of more than 200 crore rupees which came in during Anna Movement. Even on camera Anna said more than 3 crore people donated during the movement. When the media asked him about these accusations then Kejriwal could have simply denied them but instead he lied and said he does not know any Raju Parulekar. There are many pictures of Kejriwal with Parulekar on the Internet.https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=-wnOwbLJ87829. His detention in Gujarat was well planned by him in advance just to gain cheap publicity as revealed later by his mass SMS's sent well in advance asking AAP members for assembly. He said on camera, he is being targeted by BJP.https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=KAnWNzvNK7M30. Kejriwal's official website blamed Amit Shah, Modi, RSS for Muajaffarnagar riots. In a sting operation when it became clear that Azam Khan was responsible for the riots then they y simply deleted the press release without posting any apology.

When people ask Kejriwal why you are making accusations against Gadkair/Vadra etc why you are not going to court, then he says he does not trust court, they are corrupt. But in a letter to Muslim, he says that Prashant Bhusan is fighting cases to save the terrorist in Batla Hause encounter /Ishrat Jahan encounter. Kejriwal has faith in courts for saving terrorist, but not have trust in proving corruption of Vadra/Gadkari.34. Arvind Kejriwal says in Delhi that during his 49 days govt there was a reduction in corruption by x% reported by Transparency international but later Transparency international sent letters and clarified that they never said such thing in any of their reports.http://timesofindia .indiatimes .com/india/After-Transparency-International-rebuff-embarrassed-AAP-regrets-corruption-error/articleshow/30626180.cms35.

When people ask questions about Anjali Damania Land scams, then Kejriwal calls her ordinary volunteer, but later gives her LokSabha ticket!http://news. oneindia. in/nagpur/top-contests-of-2014-muttemwar-gadkari-anjali-damania-lse-1427557.html38.

<comment>People know by very well that BJP paid media and paid trolls do exist and they are trying to malign AAP day in and day out. So the paid propaganda of BJP against AAP  are not going to touch AAP whose popularity is soaring. It is BJP who is exposed day by day. Mark my words.BJPis going to pay a heavy price for their double speak.Bihar has already given huge drubbing  to BJP. UP and Punjab will be the next. Also wait till MCD election.BJP will be wiped out from Delhi forsure.</comment>

<comment>Excellent compilation in one place.</comment>

<comment>how big was the author's tin foil cap when he was writing this article???? apparently Kejriwal is YUGPURUSH and do no wrong, everyone in the world are liars and Kejri is voice of truth... I mean he has been lying about proof of corruption on everyone but still not a single arrest or fir. all show and no substance. Where is the proof on DDCA?? Shelia Dixit?? nitin gadkari??? he even went to jail because he made baseless claims on Nitin Gadkari and will also go to jail for Jaitley issue, I mean after ranting for about 5 days on tv taking Jaitley's name in the interview he says I never took anybody's name..... I mean how much can you lie??????</comment>

<comment>Look at how the piggy Khujili squealed when Gadkari took him to court.Hey AAPtards, if Khujili has proofs, why is he squealing like a pig in court? :D:D:Dhttp://www .ndtv. com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-withdraws-plea-against-court-order-in-defamation-case-filed-by-nitin-gadkari-766116</comment>

<comment>What is there to work ? Khujliwaal has been blaming others without any proof. He has no proof against Shiela Dixit. He is not paying MCD workers salary, creating chaos in Delhi.This guy should be kicked out immediately. People of Delhi should come out in protest asking for fresh elections asap. This is the only way to teach him a lesson. He has been elected to work for people of Delhi and not for his nautanki.</comment>

<comment>Absolutelu agree..Zero work...full nautanki</comment>

<comment>Here is the begging Khujili did in court when Gadkari dragged him...Like a pig Khujili begged...http://www .ndtv. com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-withdraws-plea-against-court-order-in-defamation-case-filed-by-nitin-gadkari-766116</comment>

<comment>Only 1 question to aapians .....Who after kejriwal?You will see the person centric party.....nothing else</comment>

<comment>After Kejriwal - it is his chamcha - Manish Sisodia. He is too scared to look at camera's directly. Involved in the NGO scam and all the Delhi ads are given to his relatives company. Shame on AAP. Yes to find the proof against Shiela Dixit, which was one of the reasons they were voted to power.It is time for re-election. People of Delhi come together and start dharna against AAP. This is the only language they understand.</comment>

<comment>definitely Rahul Gandhi is thinking about that</comment>

<comment>BJP Leaders and Bhakts are unable to digest Kejriwals success, fame and the love and affection shown by Delhi people towards him. Going by his rising popularity, it is sure that Kejriwal will sweep Punjab elections and will also decimate BJP im MCD elections. Not able to tolerate this, BJP trying all possible cunning, cheap,  cowardly and highly despicable actions and some how trying to create bad image about AAP using paid media and trolls. They keep throwing mud at Kejriwal, hoping that atleast some dirt will actually stick.  BJP Guys what ever you guys attempt….Kejriwal has won our hearts already. He is the only truthful, honest and well educated CM and he is going to show BJP its place soon. Just wait and watch</comment>

<comment>Modi has been secretly and systematically selling off Indias assets and resources to Ambani and Adani. All assets including land  of institutions like   BSNL. LIC  etc which spreads all over India will be handed over by Modi to Advaniand Adani within 5 years..Just wait and watch</comment>

<comment>Yes only Sukhdev knows the details. Please provide the proof to Kejriwal, so he can start the dharna, like he did in case of Shiela Dixit. Open your eyes and you will see what Modi govt is doing. He is running country which was handed over to him with sick economy. Kejriwal on the other hand cannot even manage a city (yes Delhi is a city not even a state).</comment>

<comment> Why Modi is so scared of Kejriwal.?!!!  1) When Kejriwal visited Gujarat, Modi got sacred and refused to see him. He even had Kejriwal detained by the police.2) When AAP announced that Kejriwal will contest against Modi in Varnasi, Modi  got scared and  immediately announced that he will contest from one more seat. Fearing defeat Modi had to arrange  large  scale fake voting to defeat Kejriwal.3) During Delhi elections, Modi again got scared of Kejriwal and ran away hiding behind Bedi to save his skin. Resuls proved Modi''s fear was not misplaced. 67-3!!!4) When Kejriwal was strengthening ACB, Modi again got scared and  send paramilitary forces to snatch ACB from state government. 5) Modi is scared to  take on Kejriwal head on and has been hiding behind LG and shooting using LG''s shoulders.6) Scared to fight Kejriwal directly, Modi has been hiding behind groups like, Aam aadmi sena, Bhagat singh kranti sena, AVAM  etc and  is waging a cheap proxy war against Kejriwal.6) Modi is scared of the legitimate questions asked by Kejriwal or doesnt have an answer at all. . So fearing tough questions, Modi has been running away from interviews or a debate and is always hiding behind Paid media, Paid trolls and paid PR firms and waging cheap propaganda war against Kejriwal It is not surprising that Kejriwal called him a coward and a Psychopath. Perhaps there are no better words to explain Modi's behaviour </comment>

<comment>I think ppl shall not become pawns of political figures....let thier fight be between them....we must focus on our issues....who is coward and who is rambo I dont care...who is working for us thats what matters...</comment>

<comment>Bhakts will never learn.. until they loose is most of the states they wont shut up. They think spreading negative propaganda about AAP and Kejriwal will change people's mindset/opinion about them, but ignores the obvious corruption and apathy which every Indian experiences on the ground. Its actually good let them keep doing it its us the AAP supporters and AAP who will benefit from it.</comment>

<comment>Yeah..Keep doing corruption and blame BJP..Now AAPtards will soon claim Tomar was forced by Modi to get fake certificate!</comment>

<comment>BJPee and Congress are the least qualified venal parties to lecture on corruption !!  The World laughs at them when they talk of curbing corruption !!</comment>

<comment>This guy probably typed this article with khujli's dck in his mouth</comment>

<comment>So many AAP supporters are saying Khujili has done soooo much work..Surprisingly none of them are able to provide one single link which shows the work they have done!!Probably in the history after doing work, a party has no proofs to show it has done work :D:D:D:</comment>

<comment>Bhai...forget about AAP suppoerters...the appreciation of AAP's work came from BJP Venkiah Naidu itself...</comment>

<comment>I have read the article and it's not stating anything as achievements...In fact I am copy pasting it for readers to know exactly what it is saying :D:D:D:DIt talks the same crap language used by AAPtards which says he delivered on things when in actually he has done no such thing!!It talks about decrease in corruption - LOLbelow is the article for non-AAPtards to have funDespite the hurdles put by the Centre through Lt Governor Najeeb Jung and Delhi police, Kejriwal government in Delhi focused on delivering on its promises. The AAP has made a steady start with delivering on many promises, but the job is not done yet. The issue of ‘full statehood’ is stuck between Centre and State logjam. The Jan Lokpal bill hasn’t been passed despite the fact that the AAP has a full majority in the Assembly. The AAP government introduced and most importantly implemented ‘student loan scheme’, one of the biggest poll promise of the party in Delhi for providing easy loan facilities to students seeking higher education. Under the ‘Higher Education Credit Guarantee Scheme’, Delhi government would provide loans up to Rs 10 lakh without any collateral or third party guarantee or margin money to students. There would be no processing charges for the same. In its budget, AAP government even made highest allocations — Rs 4,570 crore — to the education sector, 106% more than the last budget. It also installed CCTV cameras in schools. The pilot project of CCTV cameras has been initiated in 3 schools as of now.Student loan scheme and CCTV camera:Arvind Kejriwal took several initiatives to take up the reins of corruption. Whether you like Kejriwal or not but you will have to accept that the corrupt have been reined to an extent during a short span of time. He armed the common man with anti-corruption helpline number. Indeed, Dehlities also felt that corruption decreased in last nine months. Recently, a report of Centre for Media Studies (CMS) – India Corruption Study 2015 found that nearly half of the Delhi residents felt that corruption decreased in the state.Corruption:Taking major steps for giving cheap electricity and free water supply, Kejriwal announced 50 per cent subsidy on the monthly power consumption of up to 400 units. Although the AAP government didn’t reduce the power tariff but sought audit of discoms from CAG. The AAP-government also announced 20,000 litres of free water per month to all households. It also brought down the water development and sewer development charges in unauthorized colonies. The subsidy on power rates and free water provided major relief to around 10.5 lakh consumers.Bijli Pani:</comment>

PAANi is basic need it should be free in limited amount and DISCOMS was doing irregularities in bijli that's why price were high, he reduced it .. cag report came and every thing is in public</comment>

<comment>NOW you are showing your true colors Sickular...between is there are irregularities, why is Khujili not going to courts???We know you hate Hindus, no worries for us, but don't pretend..We all know the truth about Allah Abraham Party and it's prophet.</comment>

<comment>enough of your questions, now ans me this why vasundhra is still cm shiv raj is still cm why land was given at thrown away amount to hema malini and gujrat cm's daughter</comment>

<comment>All I am hearing is a bunch of BS without any proofs..Especially when you AAPtards don't answer why Khujili after getting caught in hawala is still CM..</comment>

<comment>That is somewhat better,  Isn't it,   when  you refrain yourself from  indulging in a  conceited attempt to deceive public with  blitzkrieg propaganda rolling out facts and figures disconnected with reality in a sly endeavour to manufacture headlines and create better optics but seriously compromising and  short on delivery like your beleaguered  Feku Government which has made a total mockery of governance  !!</comment>

<comment>tomar is not in party anymore... why vasundhra is still cm shiv raj is still cm, why nobody is talking on land scam... tomar is out of party.....now plz defend this</comment>

<comment>You AAPtards conveniently forget how Khujili abused Modi when Tomar was caught.When proofs became glaring, Khujili had no other option...Regarding vasundara and Shiv Raj, if Khujili has proofs, he can approach SC like Swamy did..In fact Khujili shot off his mouth against gadkari and then said sorryNow he shot his mouth against Jaitley and he is begging courts not to prosecute him...If he has proofs against jaitley, why not share it with courts? why beg now?</comment>

<comment>tu mere sawal ka jawab dene .. bhaag q raha hai</comment>

<comment>I did..I explained why Khujili has to expel Tomar I also asked U and Khujili to share proofs against rake and Chouhan with courts..Are u AAptards shy? Why can't u go to courts with proofs??Or u want us to take u on the word of your prophet liar Khujili?!!</comment>

<comment>no you dint why vasundhra is still cm shiv raj is still cm why land was given at thrown away amount to hema malini and gujrat cm's daughter</comment>

<comment>Ever since AAP govt under Kejriwal came to power, it has been satisfying its election promises one by one. Free water, Electricity at half charge, Educational loans, Janlokpal Bill, Bus marshals, Constuction of Public toiets, Mohalla clinics, Poly clinics, Aam aadmi clinics, Free Medicines and free diagnostic services in Government hospitals, Online issue of Certificates, Anti corruption helpline, E ration cards, E Riksha permits, stopping red beacon culture, Abolishing management quota and donation in Schools etc have already been done.Steps to make Delhi a wifi city, installing CCTV cameras, reduce pollution, regularization of colonies. laying of pipe lines to areas without water connection are all underway. Flyovers are being constructed at hundreds of crores less than the estimated cost during rhe previous govt. People of Delhi are tasting the fruits of better civic services, concern for aam aadmi, better governance, responsive govt officials and more citizen friendly policies. The odd-even formula has also been a resounding success due to the whole hearted participation of Delhites.It is not surprising that BJP and Congress  have become completely frustrated over the rising popularity of Kejriwal and have been resorting to cheap and dirty tricks one after another to somehow show Kejriwal and AAP in bad light.</comment>

<comment>New Delhi, November 11: Barely nine months after coming to power, Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi managed to fulfil big promises made by the party during Delhi Assembly Election. Latest in the list was the completion of six-lane elevated road stretching from heavy traffic spot of Azadpur to Prambori.Since Arvind Kejriwal took charge of Delhi government, the AAP-government in Delhi has delivered on some of its big promises. like Electricity, water, corruption, education, health, Student loans, CCTV cameras, construction of toilets, Roads, Bus Marshals etc Kejriwal has achieved this despite the hurdles put by the Centre through Lt Governor Najeeb Jung and Delhi police......

<comment>tera sacrcasm nonsense hai nah.. cliché political line m really fed up man</comment>

<comment>With in one year Allah Abraham Party has reached such pathetic state that even Congress thinks they are corrupt!!On a serious note, to Kejriwal and AAP supporters, this is what happens when you allege every one and their mother.Eventually people will start doing the same to you and u will have no escape!</comment>

<comment>sala pagal banda har post pe dikhta hai tu kuchh or kaam nahi hai tujhhe</comment>

<comment>kejri doing a PC now its so funny</comment>

<comment>err..how come you are criticizing Kejri?!!!</comment>

<comment>he is a cong bhakt</comment>

<comment>bihar ki beti has been exposed today. was exposed in 2013 itself when IB chief Asif Ibrahim had claimed of concrete evidence of her being an LeT operative.</comment>

<comment>Now,they are supporting a terrorist just because she was used to attack Modi and Amit Shah.Be very very afraid about these people.They have put away all pretenses now.They are openly pro-Jehadi now.</comment>

<comment>AAPtards are now exclusively ex-congress sickular supporters who were not happy with the way they were getting trounced.After Punjab elections, I am sure quite a few of the AAPtards will become ex-AAPtards ;)</comment>

<comment>This AAPtard and Cong supporter is a just a charade.They are Chrislamic Khalistanis who have 3 broad objectives.1.Evangelisation 2.Jehadi war on India 3.Khalistan for some from Punjab.Everything else is just a charade.</comment>

<comment>like kapu of AP</comment>

<comment>Now,the inner Jehadi wakes up.</comment>

<comment>from when kapus became jihaids for AP ppl</comment>

<comment>I am talking about you Jehadi.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely biased article. Then what about his allegations over BJP without any base proofs? FP is becoming very worst day by day.</comment>

<comment>When will AAP and JDU combinedly hold a rally for Ishrat Jehan?Waiting to see that moronery.Dont take it as a joke.They will do it sometime in the future.</comment>

<comment>JDU and JUD, sounds so similar, isn't it?</comment>

<comment>and from ur state MIM will join that</comment>

<comment>Yes,for sure.</comment>

<comment>Kejariwal spent 1 year blaming Modiji & central govt.  It is d only achievement of AAP for the last one year.. kejari called Modi at least 1 Lakh times in this 1 year..</comment>

<comment>Charges for the treatment were Rs 71,925 while airfare cost the administration Rs 13,305. The total amount spent on the AAP chief was Rs 85,230</comment>

<comment>MOdi has traveled the world .... his airfare costs is in crores stop bull shi*ing you dumb bhakt!!</comment>

<comment>Yes you are absolutely right .... Modi went on Vacation.... Pure AAPtard Logic... Kudos to you..</comment>

<comment>gas prices are cheaper and affordable even when global prices are below 30 dollars a barrel inflation is down , food prices are down... amazing job by the great Modi!</comment>

<comment>yep yep he has brought in so many jobs so much investment ... my god.. I can see it , or roads are getting better , there is no more garbage everywhere , electricity and water  24/7 wow Modi is so awesome right.</comment>

<comment>How many villages didnt have electricity when Modi joined office... Do you have any Idea  ?? ... and how many are remaining now... Do you have any idea,.,, Once an AAPtard always an AAPtard...</comment>

<comment>Ha yeah all on paper what proof do you have that they have done so? or are you going by some "report " that the BJP concocted? How much will you guys defend him that too even when you know that you are wrong. Is your Ego bigger than the nation? Ask yourself this.</comment>

<comment>So what do you expect me to do ..go to each and every village and verify !!! ... Another AAPtard logic :D   and on the contrary i want to ask is your EGO bigger than the nation when you defend AK who says all are wrong except him... Prashant Bhushan , Yogendra Yadav, Shazia etc and the list goes on :D ...So we know who has the Biggest EGO... buddy there is a saying "keep your hands clean before you point fingers "</comment>

<comment>Please dont talk about "clean hands" there is no ones hands who are dirtier than Modi's.. Plus if you dont know what politics entails that too of a country like India where the whole corrupt system has been shaken by a newcomer, please dont spew venom. You can go on barking like your fellow bhakts and public will continue to ignore. You can see now election after election you are loosing and will loose. Just wait and watch the people have woken up to the farce that MOdi and BJP are.. They came to power ONLY because of the dismal performance by congress in UPA2.. But your honeymoon period is over..</comment>

<comment>Good for you  :D ... AK is really lucky to have you as his supporter ....</comment>

<comment>Thanks and keep smiling all the way to the coming elections also. Your party will need that.</comment>

<comment>I dont belong to any party and am sure never will... but being optimistic about the future is the right of every citizen... Dont be a part of the problem .. be a part of the solution.. as a citizen I do my duties right.. and commenting on blogs is part of a leasure activity... Do you really believe what we comment is going to be helpful for any party or the country as a whole... People just vent their frustrations and affiliations .. nothing more .. nothing less... so Chill Brother :D</comment>

<comment>I agree I am doing the same. By your party i meant the party that you support which is BJP, Either way from both our points of view we want whats best for the nation. that why we are here commenting on this posts. Atleast from my side its that reason. SO chill bro:)</comment>

<comment>Yeah..Even after SC decision..Afzal Guru is innocent for you guys...So, yeah, we believe your rants ;);)</comment>

<comment>Haha keeping lying you are only helping your opposition. who the hell cares about Afzal guru! he is a terrorist and AAP has nothing to do with him ... How much will you lie... actually please continue.. you are only helping us..</comment>

<comment>AAP has nothing to do with him?!!!!!Please don't say that to kejru...he will be soooo hurted.We all saw his exceptional support in Hyderabad to people who were supporting Afzal guru..</comment>

<comment>kya bol raha hai illogical indian, yanha baat travel expense ki horahi thi,</comment>

<comment>Main toh wohi bol raha hoon , Modi went on Vacation... thats what all AAPtards and Sicularist think... So i am not going to say anthing otherwise ... because you wouldnt understand :D</comment>

<comment>modi is doing fine job but he is not able able to curb corruption within govt offices.. and other bjps are reluctant .modi is not interested towards small level corruption and proper channelizing govt schemes, he is busy announcing schemes day in day out but doest have audacity to impelement it at ground level, he is busy in raisinmg GDP states which is not helping which I I don't thing is helping poors, where as kejriwal is working at ground level..</comment>

<comment>Stop it buddy..When I ask what Kejriwal has done you have no answer!!All you do is keep repeating he has done this and that without showing one actual proof!!How do u expect us to believe it??</comment>

<comment>already answered it, scroll down.. talk rational reasonable and logical else plz don't ruin my precious time</comment>

<comment>LMAO...</comment>

<comment>hehe</comment>

<comment>as far as garbage is concerned, even GOD cant teach us.</comment>

<comment>anil just slammed you with your own logic you stupid bhakt</comment>

<comment>what an absurd logic dheeraj and anil. we do not expect anything from people like u. Since AK has not done anything for Delhi you have nothing to say so keep shouting otherwise, he did a lot, lot what atleast name something</comment>

<comment>The only slamming is being done by Khujili in Delhi people's behind...</comment>

<comment>he did a lot nobody has done so far in so much less time, even you know that but since you are sangh chamcha you don't have any option but boot liking of bjp</comment>

<comment>Please explain the looooooot to us as well..The only loooooot is the looting of Delhi people by Khujili and chamchas.No schoolsNo hospitalsNo roadsNo WifiNo cctv camerasNo woman protection forceno modernization of schoolsNot even one infra work started in delhi400%hike in salaries to himselfAll India toursJindal 5 star Spas..Well done mate..</comment>

<comment>and you Are a liar, ye sab ho chukka hai...liar</comment>

<comment>Where have u run off to Mr Dheeraj..Google hard to prove me a liar..:D:D:D</comment>

<comment>Well..prove one point which I am lying on with proofs..If what I have posted are wrong and You think schools and hospitals are built, please share the link with us., In fact share a link that says kejru started the work...if you can show that a hole is dug in a place to build a school or hospital, I will concede defeat and say sorry to u..CHALLENGE????</comment>

<comment>sab jhut salary chhod ke.. hasi ari hai all india tour bhi list me dala hai tune</comment>

<comment>the same can be said for u too, mr dheeraj. actually its not possible for a human being to achieve everything within such a short time.</comment>

<comment>to fir q bol rahe ho ?? ki ye sab nahi kia kejriwal ne jab you already know that it will take time then whts the point to raise the issue,</comment>

<comment>Why would it take time to build one homeless shelter?Or get Woman's protection force?or CCTV cameras?Or START work on building schools or hospitals.LISTEN, it's not the fact that he has not built.It's the FACT that he has not STARTED to built them..Show me a GO that says work has started on the items I have shown and I will concede..</comment>

<comment>homeless shelter already done , dispensaries been built more are in pipe line, cctv graduall coming on street, private school quota system was abolished however court intervened , don't want to question court veracity</comment>

<comment>bhakt is a general term for a follower, of someone. so ur not an exception too, mr bhakt.</comment>

<comment>Because up until he became the PM,he couldnt visit any country as a Guj CM on states' expenses.Where do you people even come from?</comment>

<comment>so if AK is on States expenses you have a problem right? Only Modi is allowed to trvel the world.. lol what a bunch of jokers no wonder nobody takes you people seriously anymore.</comment>

<comment>Who had any problem with Kejriwal travelling?He went to some Dubai's car parking awards function.Did anyone say anything?</comment>

<comment>that too in business class. thanx to that person who took his pics n posted it on twitter.</comment>

<comment>Ticket was sent by the organizers not by the AAP or the Delhi government.</comment>

<comment>but the organizers had later on denied it. and AAP official statement was that it was from Party funds. total confusion.</comment>

<comment>He went there to receive award "Asia's most inspiring and young social change maker" from Asian Brand Summit and when an organisation decides to give someone award and invite him, THEY arrange ticket ! Instead of accusing him we should have proud of him for that award.</comment>

<comment>Let him go anywhere he wants.Why does it even concern us?These people invariably go to some foreign travel whenever anyone says anything about Kejriwal's moronery.Dont let them take the discussion to that.</comment>

<comment>AK is an aam aadmi, remember?</comment>

<comment>hehehe. he is not a modi bhakt either.</comment>

<comment>AAP & Kejariwal is the worst thing happened to India and its people. AAP made Delhi almost a dustbin. By 2019 AAP will make Delhi the world largest slum area.. We people of India r eagerly waiting to dump AAP to dustbin in the year 2019 election. Jai hind</comment>

<comment>Oh for the love of god and all that's sane in this world,please quit justifying the bhagoda and the fact that he got caught with his hands in the cookie jar, and this is in relation to both the HC's damning statements regarding Kejriwal and his secretary and worse, on the fact that he got stung after asking every citizen to use media to record evidences of graft. Irrespective of whether the congress planned it or not, the fact remains that he got stung and with good reason.Dear Pramod, I like the way you defended Kejriwal with your subtlety, but need I point out to the fact that kejriwal has been on record asking the PM of this nation to resign for what kejriwal perceived as murder, when the student in question, hanged himself. And now, you are asking why we should judge kejriwal for what one of his close associates did..do you see the hypocrisy here or is the truth a tad too inconvenient?And let us not forget the fact that when it comes to governance in delhi, there's none to be had at any price. Ask any aapturd and they would scream "new schools, water, electricity" when in reality, he has not delivered on anything, other than making announcements of one sort or the other..given all this, Kejriwal has some really hard questions, as to his er performance which consisted of no delivery, attacking our PM for all the moronic reasons, including whether the sky is blue or orange, and for not working for delhi at all..Need I even point out the obvious bias in the article..hope you got the point, unless of course you're a closet aapturd</comment>

<comment>Don't waste your precious time is writing factful comments to AAPtards. Fact/logic/proof never meant for AAP. Useless garbages.</comment>

<comment>That someone who painted all politicians as villains and corrupt, could launch his own party with clean funding and win elections, irks vested interests across party lines no end. Hence when it comes to AAP, BJP and congress are one. They would do anything to make this experiment a failure.Looks like people of India have other idea. With right thinking people always around to pitch in with funds, nothing can stop AAP.</comment>

<comment>Headley just showed how 'secular' media along with Cong+Left punished people for killing terrorists.A terrorist like Headley had to say that for Indian media to understand that police in Guj killed terrorists.Sad state of affairs.</comment>

<comment>The congress and its B party have some hard questions to answer, like why they preferred to compromise the national security of the nation for playing cheap vote bank politics and let us not forget that this bhagoda, actually declared the batla house incident as make believe and the terrorist gunned down as a martyr - the incident exploded in kejrwal's face spectacualarly which only exposes the anti national mindset of congress, aap and  kejriwal..</comment>

<comment>Trying to hijack the topic?Nice try, but there are wise people on the planet sorry!</comment>

<comment>No,I am not trying to do anything.Its you who came out of the woods as a closet Jehadi by supporting a terrorist.Anyway,why do you people always side with Jehadis?Some kind of Desert origin of your religions?</comment>

<comment>Nice come back..</comment>

<comment>500 schools in 5 years not even a single school, no new college ,no new hospital,where are the cameras in the buses ,delhi enjoying free Wi-Fi ?now public hospitals better than private hospital,now we are proud to send our children to govt schools,safe Delhi for women,now delhi is like paris,WAH BHAI KEJARI TUNE TO KAMAAL KAR DIYA,poori Delhi ko moorkh bana diya,LAGE raho</comment>

<comment>yesterday on karan thappar show on HT ... so many achievements listed by ashesh khaitan .. new schools , new hospitals , flyovers completed in 1 and 1/2 year .. great !!!!!  + reduced power bills for hard working middle and  lower  class</comment>

<comment>tell me how many schools out of 500 promised? flyover road, the project of shiela dikshit ?</comment>

<comment>why is BJP obsessed with Delhi? shouldn't they focus on UP now ?</comment>

<comment>seems like this decade is made for modi and AK jugalbandi</comment>

<comment>"Will corruption allegation on Kejriwal strategy by BJP and Congress ever work?"No idea. But it worked for Kejriwal.</comment>

<comment>We know where AAP is heading when they had 2 hikes for their MLAS before 1 year in govt.</comment>

<comment>its ok if they don't indulge in corruptions .. better than MLA's with 1000 of crores property</comment>

<comment>Beta after the hike too they are doing corruption ... it is double bonus to reach 1000 crores soon ...</comment>

<comment>i think it is too early to judge on corruption charges of AAP...thier are many mistakes AAP did and had been punished by ppl....and doing some good and innovative things which even discomfort common citizens..such things need courage....If a goon says give me bribe as cut of it has to be given to ministers does not put AAP in doubt....it is police who must find if thier is any involvement..and if it is AAP as party must take action against them...if not then for sure AAP will be punished again by ppl....</comment>

<comment>This article seems to be dictated verbatim by paigambar to his stooge....each word reeks of feverent sycophancy</comment>

<comment>So should I take it that you worship AK?</comment>

<comment>As a CM, he has failed at every level of Governanace. If all goes well according to the plan, he takes all the credit and if it doesn't ..... blame work continues. Always Criticising LG and Centre for his own incapabilities. Instead of Concentarting on his own consistuency, he goes miles to Bihar & Hyderabad to fulfil his nefarious agenda.</comment>

<comment>Anubhav...police is under LG control....failures of police shall be blamed on LG only...what is wrong in that....biggest nuisance of Delhi is its law & order...</comment>

<comment>That is the difference between a state and Union Territory. Doesn't Mr.AK aware this before elections? Even if you like or not, one should abide to Indian law.</comment>

<comment>Was Kejriwal not aware of police being under center's control when he decided to fight Delhi election? Why would he blame Sheila Dixit when there was some incident in Delhi then?</comment>

<comment>He blamed shiela dixit bcoz shiela dixit was congress leader which was part of central govt then...is it that difficult to understand...???</comment>

<comment>but he should have known that blaming shiela wont work as law n order was under center.</comment>

<comment>Brother...Shiela dixit was congressi and central govt was congress govt....and Shiela dixit despite happening so many issues of law & order was not taking it with centre...so who will be blamed....</comment>

<comment>just imagine, when both the center n state had same party govt, they did not care for shiela dixit. so why ak expects the same impossible thing now. there is only one solution. full fledged statehood to delhi to solve all the administration issues.</comment>

<comment>it was not personal issue with shiela dixit...it was against congress which was headed by shiela dixit in delhi state...thier is a difference....and if CM is so incapable which can not pressurize to influence its own govt in centre then such govt is not worthy...</comment>

<comment>he was hoping to force congi central govt to do something. his bad luck, BJP came to power at center and they will destroy delhi just to punish kejri..</comment>

<comment>Then explain why Kejru used to blame Sheila Dikshit for poor law and order situation in Delhi. Even then the police was under the LG.</comment>

<comment>he was hoping to force congi central govt to do something. his bad luck, BJP came to power at center and they will destroy delhi just to punish kejri.</comment>

<comment>Ha Ha Ha, The central govt has no other work other than creating trouble for poor bechara Kejriwal.</comment>

<comment>He was a fool if he was thinking on those lines. When the Congi govt at the Centre did not listen to its own Delhi CM why would it had done anything because Kejru wanted it.As to destroying Delhi, Kejru started that process the day he took over. By the time he finishes his term, Delhi, a  Dharavi  like slum, rotting and stinking.</comment>

<comment>it is not wat CM wants...it is what ppl want...COngress, BJP and AAP all promised complete statehood in thier manifesto....now its time to honour it...</comment>

<comment>How do you know what people of Delhi want? Has a survey been carried out to determine that.</comment>

<comment>wat ppl want had been known in delhi election....the delhi election had happened based on issues and not on the influence of alcohol or biryaani...</comment>

<comment>Delhi elections were held only on the issue of subsidy. Kejru offered maximum subsidy on electricity and water and the greedy idiots that the Delhiites are, fell for the same. Do not forget that crates upon crates of bottles of alcohol were seized from the godown of one of the AAP candidates. So, biryani and alcohol too played their part.</comment>

<comment>what about the disbursement of salaries to MCD employees? i have heard its under AAP control.</comment>

<comment>How come MCD employees are under AAP control...MCDs are running by BJP which are bankrupt....I fully agree that AAP could have handled the issue of MCD better way but the approach of BJP was ridiculous....never seen any strike where municipality ppl are throwing garbage on road and priavte properties instead of collecting it.,...</comment>

<comment>It seems Ironical athat all his minsiters including himself are getting HIKED SALARY but when it comes to MCD Workers ..... there's no plan ..... These Strikes weren't there during Sheila Dixit's tenure</comment>

<comment>Brother...thats a big misconception again....MCD had been bankrupt long before AAP came..infact when 3 MCDs had been made out of 1 MCD....the income in 1 of the MCD had been reduced drastically...and they started complaining...year by year situation is getting worsen...</comment>

<comment>Look bro .... He has NEVER accepted his own faults and is always pointing fingers at others.Recently when he declared 551cr loan for MCD Workers he said .... 'Someone told me they are trying to create a situation to impose President’s Rule in Delhi the way they imposed it in Arunachal Pradesh' ..... Now who is this SOMEONE ?? What proof he has ..... what is the authenticity of this statement?? It doesn't really suits ... The CM of Delhi is rebuking someone in front of whole media without any concrete evidence. And this has happened multiple times now.But u cant help him .... he's like this only</comment>

<comment>Ofcourse he do drama....which is a main weapon of Arvind against the money and muscle power of BJP and congress....he is master in using sympathy and emotions of ppl to make his work done...else how come a common civil servant can make such party which defeated two national parties such a big way....</comment>

<comment>Thank u for accepting this fact. Yeah he defeated two national parties and dat too by a huge margin because people showed faith in him and dat too for the 2nd time. But doing drama is doing more harm than good and in this mess people of delhi are suffering. Now few days ago there was a CBI Rid on one's his colleague's offices and he got so melodramatic over this incident ..... first he defended him without even knowing the truth and then targetted Arun Jaitley without any evidence and there was no need of doing it. U dont hv to do drama to fight other political parties. If People are with u, then u dont hv to wrry about anything. MANIK SARKAR (CM of TRIPURA) is one such fine example. Even Opposition Respects him whole heartedly</comment>

<comment>Anubhav...u put urself in his position and imagien wat u will do against two powerful giants who have complete control over muscle, money, police and power....what will u do...AAP's only strenght is common people...whenever AAP will be in trouble it will connect and influence common ppl...The more AAP goes away from common ppl...more difficult for AAP....I dont care if they fight each other or blame each other...i have problem when politicians make common ppl fight with each other in the name of religion, region, caste, culture, color and language....we must be very careful about that....rest every time AAP will make mistake ppl will punish them...</comment>

<comment>seems like a narcissist to me.</comment>

<comment>what will they do if u dont pay their salary in time? MCD is under BJP control, but paying the salary is under the state govt.</comment>

<comment>Nahi bhai...u have big misconception...the salary deptt of MCD is very well under MCD only....but problem is MCDs declare themselves bankrupt....and demanding bailout plan from state govt....it is similar dispute as was between Kingfisher and Indian govt....I wonder what would have happened if Pilots of Kingfisher would have decided that give our salary or we will crash the plane along with passengers....</comment>

<comment>delhi politics is really a jalebi. it would have been better as an UT.</comment>

<comment>Though I would agree with u...but such a big UT was difficult to handle that is the reason..it had been made as state....but complications are not over....irrespective of whichever govt come....the issue remains....</comment>

<comment>then it should have been a full fledged state. this semi state thing is very bad.</comment>

<comment>the problem is much more complicated than we talk....delhi is a centre where all national decision are been taken...just imagine a situation...if there is dispute between State govt with full authority and centre govt....State govt may misuse thier power against lawmakers....and pressurize central govt law makers...the way forward is lutiyen delhi where law makers live shall be under central govt and rest of the delhi shall be a full state...</comment>

<comment>some where we have to search for a solution to end this daily tussle.</comment>

<comment>politcial willingness to solution must be there....all 3 political parties promised delhites for Full statehood....turning their back to delhi ppl is not correct....AAP and BJP must work together for betterment of delhi and India...</comment>

<comment>AAP and BJP r like snake and mongoose. as long as AK does not show some maturity, it will be difficult.</comment>

<comment>lol</comment>

<comment>Wohaaaa. ... MCD is under BJP. got it.</comment>

<comment>true. but the salaries dept is under state control. salary disbursement is under AAP.</comment>

<comment>No baba.,....u r wrong...plz do some study by urself....or u want me to spoon feed every thing....plz study what was exact issue of MCD...</comment>

<comment>thats why they were burning the effigies of both AK and Modi.</comment>

<comment>whatever i came across from reports.</comment>

<comment>Yeah..Nothing is under Kejru..The only thing AAP is doing in delhi is looting people!</comment>

<comment>Brother u r complaining as if this had been revealed just now....AAP is continuously demanding for full statehood and so was BJP and COngress was saying before election....the problem is it is fact that Delhi govt is just care taker of few things and absolute control is with L-G....</comment>

<comment>If nothing is under Kejru..Whose hair he is plucking being Delhi CM?</comment>

<comment>only God knows.</comment>

<comment>Biggest nuisance of Delhi is Kejru and AAPholes</comment>

<comment>ur comment does not justify looking at delhi election result and ODD & Even phase 1 success....</comment>

<comment>It wasn't a success at all .... The surveys conducted after 15th Jan clearly indicates that during those 15 days the air quality remained same as earlier and in some cases it has even got worse. U can google it. There are number of surveys which cklearly indicates that it was a failure. just because Delhi people hv opted for it again (because they also want poluution free environment). doesn't mean it was a success.</comment>

<comment>We are not discussing about pollution at the moment...we are discussing Delhi ppl support with AAP govt...</comment>

<comment>We also saw the garbage success and AAP ka ghotala be it Fake certificates or corruption..And the vulture tours of Kejru, disgusting..</comment>

<comment>i would say odd-even scheme as a true achievement of AAP govt. and i appreciate it.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense..In fact pollution levels increased in those days.People appreciated it because it lessened the traffic and nothing else.</comment>

<comment>okay. even if traffic is controlled thats a great achievement.</comment>

<comment>flyovers which take 5 years  completed in 1 and  1/2  years ..  great !!!</comment>

<comment>Why would the state govt get credit, won't that be some MCD work? When issues it is MCD, when credit it is the state govt :-)</comment>

<comment>i think AAP will clean sweep next MCD elections like assembly elections</comment>

<comment>AAPHoles and their lies..The flyover started 6 years back under shiela and got completed in Kejru's..As usual lies and  more lies!</comment>

<comment>Mr. Kejriwal himself has said thay it'll be an achievement for him if he can complete even 50% of all the promises he made before elections in 5 years. Looking at how things are going for them, I think it'll be an achievement if he can deliver even 10% of what he promised. So approximately, no change at all. Delhi is going to remain as it is</comment>

<comment>yesterday on karan thappar show on HT ... so many achievements listed by ashesh khaitan .. new schools , new hospitals , .. great !!!</comment>

<comment>List of schools and hospitals please. Its easy to say that we are constructing bla bla bla. Where's the proof  ?? No steps has been taken for safety of women, odd even barely reduced any pollution levels and he was exposed when there was a dengue outbreak in delhi. Huis govt wasn't proactive in any of this</comment>

<comment>Yeah and locals were chanting on abp news show - kejriwal hay hay ! In just a year what an achievement for sure ;)</comment>

<comment>its true he is collecting money to run the party..........everyone collects</comment>

<comment>It was done by Congress. BJP has other serious work to do, why drag in BJP here?</comment>

<comment>FACT OF THE DAY ,::::AAP  has only sting but BJP MODI has big rope ...which can cover 100s of innerwearless BJP BAKRA BAKTS...............</comment>

<comment>Corruption allegations don't matter, as long as Kejrival keeps his promises and provides freebies to people.</comment>

<comment>yesterday on karan thappar show on HT .. so many achievements listed by ashesh khaitan .. new schools , new hospitals ,  .. great !!!</comment>

<comment>Until proven, it’s hard to judge. Some of the AAP politicians and officials of its Delhi government may be corrupt because it’s in the DNA of India’s body politic. - so the responsibility lies with khuljiwal for  he is protecting the corrupt aapturds </comment>

<comment>yesterday on karan thappar show on HT .. so many achievements listed by ashesh khaitan .. new schools , new hospitals , .. great !!!!</comment>

<comment>let them first cover the septic tank of the govt schools , 25 th jan 2016 1 boy dies in a septic tank of a delhi school</comment>

<comment>Your point is good bro, but it was Private school where a poor boy died, Looking at the incident it was considered as some kind of conspiracy. lets see.</comment>

<comment>cotton was found from the dead boy's pvt parts. thats fishy. why would someone push cotton there.</comment>

<comment>BJP and congress trying to take moral high ground is funny.... bot parites are quick to defend their own partymen/CMs / cabinet ministers saying ' no need to resign' but want others to be honest</comment>

<comment>You trying to put BJP and Congress in same line to make your point is desperate... and lame. Don't forget already 6 MLAs arrested and one CBI raid on AAP till now... If this goes on assembly should be run from jail...</comment>

<comment>well did not khujli ask modi to resign on moral grounds , because a sickulo aapturd is corrupt , does it mean he is absolved of the same moral grounds</comment>

<comment>he fell from the high moral pedestal the day he ran away from 49-day government ..that was just the beginning of many lows that AK went to as a politician ..now a days he sounding more left than left themselves</comment>

<comment>iss pre$$titute ke bhagwaan shri AAPTARD patloon uttari awastha mein kaand karte paaye gaye hain toh isse kitani takleef ho rahi hain dekho dekho</comment>
