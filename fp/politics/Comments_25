<comment>For god sake, please don't call the people who violently beaten media persons and JNU student in Court as Nationalist. these are not lawyers, they are hooligans dressed in black coat. if a lawyer takes law in his own hand and start beating people in the courtroom  not even leaving female journalists then they have no right to remain lawyers. with lawyers like such what kind of justice will prevail in courts, who have no respect for judiciary. these kind of goons think that by such hooliganism they are portraying nationalism. if they are true nationalist then they should have patience to let the court decide the judgement.</comment>

<comment>They are the hyenas out to snatch away the flesh of patriotism and devour them!</comment>

<comment>They are not progressives. They are anti-nationals funded by ISI to create internal problems in India to stall economic progress.</comment>

<comment>Death to pseudo-liberal,sickular scums who even have a problem with "UNFLURING OUR NATIONAL FLAG"....they are exposed now and have shown their true colours.</comment>

<comment>There is something seriously wrong with violent protests for reservation by Gujjars, Patels, Kapus, and now Jats. Most agitations usually start peacefully and slowly turns violent over many days if the demands are not met or excessive police force is used. But in all the above cases it was sudden and quite violent. Doesn't look natural at all.</comment>

<comment>Congress is in the back of the protests.</comment>

<comment>When you promise a lot,allow things to fester and ultimately do not deliver, frustration boils over very quickly once a tipping point is reached.The root of the problem is electoral and competitive politics.</comment>

<comment>There have been bigger promises which were never kept in the past. Even muslims were promised reservation by Congress. These agitations doesn't seems to be happening without political support.</comment>

<comment>Violence ironically happens more when the communities are actually relatively well-off and powerful.Others are simply suppressed or ignored.Muslims unite and react mostly on religion related issues  and little else.</comment>

<comment>CPI(M)’s ‘civil rights’ are for JNU students: RSS workers? Sorry, they deserve to dieFeb 20, 2016 12:21 ISTBy Srinivasa PrasadEven as CPM leaders were busy crusading for the rights of JNU students in Delhi, a bunch of the party's thugs hacked to death an RSS worker at Kannur in Kerala on Monday.That the CPM's fight for civil rights is limited to Left sympathisers and India-baiters is nowhere as clear as it is in the northern Kerala, where the party's workers kill RSS-BJP supporters with amazing regularity.The Sangh Parivar has, of course, never been found wanting in matching brutality with brutality in the region that has come to be known as Kerala's "killing fields”.Kannur residents are bracing themselves for another bout of Sicilian-type vendetta that often sparks a chain of savage killings. The proximity of elections, just three months away, only keeps the nerves on edge.Monday's murder of the 27-year-old PV Sujith was the latest in serial killings that have intermittently rocked Kannur for four decades. On Monday night a gang of assailants, whom the police later arrested and identified as CPM workers, stormed into Sujith's house in Aroli and attacked him with sticks and knives before his old parents and a younger brother.Sujith's crime? He had vigorously campaigned for the BJP in the recent local body elections in Aroli and the party had polled a substantial number of votes. Intolerance for political adversaries has been the motive in all CPM's killings in Kannur which began some 40 years ago when the RSS began to flex its own political muscles there.Article XI, Section (k) of the CPM's constitution asks its members "to defend the Party and uphold its cause against the onslaught of the enemies of the Party, the working class and the country.”The loyal party cadres find that the easiest way to do it is to bludgeon all such "enemies” to instant death.The RSS would like us to believe that it was the killing of its mukhyashikshak Vadikkal Ramakrishnan by the communists in 1968 that started it all. The CPM says it's rubbish. The party claims that its heroic efforts to protect Muslims in the Hindu-Muslim riots in Thalassery in 1971 had left the RSS in a vengeful mood. Whoever or whatever sparked it, the killings continue unabated.Just as Indiana Jones told "Panama Hat” in 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' that the world was "too small” for the two of them, the CPM and the RSS seem to tell each other that Kannur is too tiny a place to have both of them. One must annihilate the other.And like cameos in films, members of the Congress and the Muslim League occasionally pop up, beating up a Marxist here or lynching a Marxist there. But it's the CPM and the RSS-BJP that are the key players in Kerala's blood sport. And by all accounts, the CPM is the current champion.For the CPM, the hammer and sickle are not just part of its election symbol. They are potential tools of murder. Swords, axes, knives come in handy for both sides. Crude bombs, made at homes with the same ease as appams and mutta curry, are a common feature.The CPM has many "party villages”-a euphemism for KGB-style "safe houses” where perpetrators of mayhem can hide. Over time, the BJP too followed suit with its own "party villages”. Outsiders can enter such places only with dire consequences, which may include a one-way ticket to hell.Like the KGB, Kerala's CPM has zero tolerance for defectors. In a murder that shook the state in 2012, CPM workers killed TP Chandrasekharan, who had broken away from the party and launched his own outfit, by hacking his face with knives beyond recognition.The killings are always savage. Like Sujith of RSS last week, KV Sudeesh of SFI was hacked to death in 1994 in front of his parents. The SFI says Sudeesh was stabbed 37 times by "RSS fascists”.In 1999, KT Jayakrishnan of BJP, a schoolteacher, was killed in the classroom with blood spilling on his sixth standard students. The terrified children had to undergo psychiatric treatment.The precise number of political killings in the region is hard to get, though the police claim that the number is no more than 200 in last 40 years. An RTI petition revealed that 56 people had died in political violence during the 10 years between 1997 and 2008.The RSS claims that it's the worst victim of "communist terrorism”. But the swayamsevaks evidently do not subscribe to the philosophy that when one is slapped on one cheek by the enemy one must turn the other cheek too. The CPM claims that more than 300 of its activists have been eliminated by "RSS criminals” since 1980. The party's website lists many of these "martyrs”.But this week's murder of Sujith came at a particularly embarrassing time for the CPM's state and central leaderships. And it was not just because the party's leaders were tirelessly talking about freedom and democracy in the JNU context.Only three days before Sujith was killed, P Jayarajan, the Kannur district secretary of CPM, surrendered to a court to face trial for the September 2014 murder of RSS worker Elanthottathil Manoj.CPM workers threw home-made bombs at the car in which Manoj was travelling and, when the vehicle lost control, stabbed him.Manoj's crime was that he had unsuccessfully tried to kill Jayarajan in 1999. The CBI, which was asked to probe the case, said Jayarajan was the "kingpin and mastermind” behind Manoj's murder as well as "several other brutal crimes”.Jayarajan had earlier been arrested for the murder of Muslim League worker Abdul Shukoor. Earlier this month, the Kerala High Court ordered a CBI inquiry into Shukoor's killing after the police said the CPM's "intimidatory tactics” had prevented them from conducting a proper investigation.After Manoj's murder, Jayarajan had said that the Congress and the Sangh Parivar were colluding to implicate CPM in false cases to make his party look like a "terrorist outfit.” But nobody was convinced.Jayarajan's bluff was called by his own son Jain Raj, who boasted on a social media site that the killing was "long awaited”, which prompted the police to slap a case on the son as well.This was not the first time that CPM boasted of its killings. In 2012, senior CPM leader MM Mani made a chilling confession at a public rally that the party had methodically eliminated its rivals in the Idukki district in 1980s. He was arrested.At the root of this mindless violence has always been the perception of threat from political adversaries. The CPM has always been in a panic over RSS taking away its supporters. This fear only strengthened in the last five years, and that's not surprising.The BJP increased its vote share from 4.75 per cent in the 2006 assembly elections to 6.06 in the 2011 assembly elections, to 10.3 per cent in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and an all-time high of 13.3 per cent in the 2015 civic elections.Kerala has been calm since Monday's killing. But a peaceful Kerala makes people more tense than a tense Kerala. During tension, one knows whose murder is causing it. During peace, one has no way of knowing who will be next.</comment>

<comment>Gandhi was getting sidelined.  Luckily for Congress, he was assassinated.   Lucky for Gandhiji's legacy also  - it got magnified .</comment>

<comment>Can you name one substitute for Gandhi in the freedom movement, who achieved as much as he did in mobilizing the masses of India and who has not been glorified?</comment>

<comment>If you need proof of the "great reverence" RSS has for our Tricolor, read this:In 2001, three activists of Rashtrapremi Yuwa Dal– president Baba Mendhe, and members Ramesh Kalambe and Dilip Chattani — along with others allegedly entered the RSS headquarters in Reshimbagh, Nagpur on 26 January, Republic Day of India and forcibly hoisted the national flag there amid patriotic slogans. They contended that RSS had never before or after independence, ever hoisted the tri-colour in their premises, even on Independence Day and Republic Day. Offences under relevant section of Bombay Police Act and IPC were registered by Police against the trio, resulting in their being jailed. They were released after 11 years in 2013. The arrests and the flag-hoisting issue stoked a controversy, which was raised in the Parliament as well. In 2002, subsequently the National Flag was raised in the RSS headquarters on the occasion of Republic Day for the first time, after 52 years.</comment>

<comment>until 2002 Indian flag code was strict</comment>

<comment>Why they entered forcibly ?</comment>

<comment>Tricolour brings out extreme patriotism in patriots, and extreme anti-nationalism in libtards</comment>

<comment>how abt rss</comment>

<comment>RSS support this move but wat abt u</comment>

<comment>Really!!! Please explain then as to why the RSS never used to hoist the national flag between 1950 and 2000 on its premises on 26th Jan and 15th August? Why have they started doing since 2000? What has changed? </comment>

<comment>First of all RSS is not a University funded by tax payer.  N FYI  flag has been flying  in RSS HQ since GoI allowed pvt citizens to fly it.</comment>

<comment>The rules do not apply on the occasion of republic and independence days - anyone can fly the tricolour on these days. The RSS did it twice (1949  and 1950) and then did not do it for 50 years, then started hoisting it again - please explain.</comment>

<comment>Nehru govt brought a law which stated that the the national flag could only be unfurled on Govt building .. so....after Supreme court judgement they started  hoisting</comment>

<comment>i finished my college it wont matter for me much...wat abt u</comment>

<comment>They will blame Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi for the earthquake.</comment>

<comment>See how much respect the RSS has for our constitution:On 6 February 1950, the RSS mouthpiece Organizer carried another article, titled "Manu Rules our Hearts" by a retired High Court Judge Sankar Subba Aiyar, which reaffirmed their support for the Manusmriti as the final lawgiving authority for Hindus, rather than the Constitution of India. It stated, "Even though Dr. Ambedkar is reported to have recently stated in Bombay that the days of Manu have ended it is nevertheless a fact that the daily lives of Hindus are even at present day affected by the principles and injunctions contained in the Manusmrithi and other Smrithis. Even an unorthodox Hindu feels himself bound at least in some matters by the rules contained in the Smrithis and he feels powerless to give up altogether his adherence to them"</comment>

<comment>If you love your country plz stop watching rundtv from today.</comment>

<comment>Which "channels" then should one watch?</comment>

<comment>Modiji used national flag to clean his face while sweating. He also ordered a Cake having National flag on it. Modiji insulted National Anthem during Russia visit. Its only BJP and Modi has right to insult National flag and National Anthem not others. Its their copyright.</comment>

<comment>Your RELIGION embarrassed humanityWhy don't you change your species name from homo sapiens</comment>

<comment>what religion has to do with it?? how much you have been paid by chaddis to spread such stupid hate messages</comment>

<comment>Ali Sahab I am paid 72 Yezdi girls to spread the message of suicide bombing by my mullah.</comment>

<comment>In that case, you are anti-Modi, anti-Hindu, anti-national, unpatriotic and you should go to Pakistan (if not already there). These are not my words - this is the central line followed by RSS bhakts, Modi fanboys and cheer-girls.</comment>

<comment>Yes I know my mullah also talks like you and I am ready to go to Pakistan to meet my mullah.</comment>

<comment>I don't know CHADDI developed software of KILLING or beheading people with messages. If they had developed, then NEXT NOBEL PRIZE will go to Bhagwat</comment>

<comment>It's going to remain unfurled all the time ? Oh !</comment>

<comment>What an irony that the Sanghis are now glorifying the Tricolor!After the Tricolor was adopted as the National Flag of India by the Constituent Assembly of India on 22 July 1947, the RSS mouthpiece Organiser viciously attacked the Tricolor and denigrated its being chosen as the National Flag of India.  The 14 August 1947 issue of the Organiser, in an article titled "Mystery  behind the Bhagwa Dhwaj", stated "The people who have come to power by the kick of fate may give in our hands the Tricolor but it never be respected and owned by Hindus.The word three is in itself an evil, and a flag having three colours will certainly produce a very bad psychological effect and is injurious to a country"By Manusmriti Irani's standards this clearly amounts to sedition!</comment>

<comment>How many pigs did pedo momad r@pe? </comment>

<comment>1) The RSS never ever participated in the freedom struggle - except Baliram Hedgewar went to jail for one year. Its icon, V D Savarkar begged the British for clemency and forgiveness.2) Until 2000 or  so, the RSS never used to hoist the national flag on the occasion of the republic day and the independence day - now they do it for "show"Now, it has "self-appointed" itself as the judge and jury on nationalism and patriotism.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, we know. Its sad they are making their heroes as National Heroes. However I am happy atleast RSS did one good thing by accepting National flag</comment>

<comment>I am not happy that I spite of making talk claims that Muslims fought with Hindus Buddhists Christians Atheists etc. they divided India claiming that Muslims cannot live in majority India. Jinnah made tall claims and Muslims didn't stand up to him but went with him and divided India. Now why are you still here since you already got your PURE Holy PAKistan nah?</comment>

<comment>"However I am happy atleast RSS did one good thing by accepting National flag"I am not sure about that.</comment>

<comment>Bhagwa is original Hindu flag used by Kings in past and even seen today on all temples</comment>

<comment>So?</comment>

<comment>What so?</comment>

<comment>You mean  as I respect my National Flag,  I must be Sanghi, correct ?</comment>

<comment>I mean when a Sanghi insults the flag, it is Patriotism. When Kanhaiya make a speech against Manuwadis it is Sedition. Very logical indeed.</comment>

<comment>LOL...kanhaiyaa speech is pointing to the ills of society....let's assume that...and he found them post may 2014</comment>

<comment>No, He means only a Sanghi can insult NAtional flag, others have no right to do.</comment>

<comment>It also means that in spite of dividing India Muslims still can live in India terrorize Jndia and be ready to divide India. </comment>

<comment>The tricolour was opposed since it was direct take off from INC flag</comment>

<comment>And they opposed Ambedkar's constitution because it did not follow Manu's Laws!! Don't believe me. Read the RSS mouthpiece Organizer of  6 February 1950.</comment>

<comment>I know that anyway our constitution is mostly rip off from then democracies</comment>

<comment>Exactly !Point of discussion was choice of flag !!Even today 3 is not auspicious !!</comment>

<comment>ATLEAST THEY moved on, and you moved to stone age, Jihadi monster</comment>

<comment>See how much the RSS respects our constitution:On 6 February 1950, the RSS mouthpiece Organizer carried another article, titled "Manu Rules our Hearts": "Even though Dr. Ambedkar is reported to have recently stated in Bombay that the days of Manu have ended it is nevertheless a fact that the daily lives of Hindus are even at present day affected by the principles and injunctions contained in the Manusmrithi and other Smrithis.

<comment>Even today some muslims believe in sharia !!</comment>

<comment>Are you trying to justify one wrong by another?</comment>

<comment>NO But raise your voice equally for that also!!</comment>
