The fringe group apologists in the intellectual circles confound one with their amazing ability to obfuscate matters and evade taking a stand.<img class="alignleft wp-image-2467830 size-full" src="http://s4.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Modi-in-Bhagalpur4_PTI.jpg" alt="Modi-in-Bhagalpur4_PTI" width="380" height="285" />A small clarification in the beginning: the word apologist comes in because there is no better descriptor available. These intellectuals don’t quite fit into the definitions of ‘liberal’, ‘secular’  or ‘humanist’ – in fact, they hate these words - and they would hate to be branded as ‘communal’ or ‘illiberal’ or any such word with a negative connotation. They won’t identify themselves with the activities of the rabid fringe but would not shy away from providing robust justification for their actions in public forums. Since they themselves are not sure where they stand ‘apologist’ suffices for the time being.Now, come to the matter of obfuscation. We still don’t have an honest, outright condemnation of the killing of rationalists or the lynching of a man in Dadri over beef or all other activities the intolerant groups have become notorious for. What we have is an explanation, rather justification, for such acts through mischievous and circuitous logic: this happened during the Congress also, didn’t it? Shouldn’t the majority sentiment matter too? This is the direct outcome of the policy of Muslim appeasement that has been going on for years.Why won’t they tell us clearly that they support what the fringe does? By contrast, the BJP leadership has been quite explicit in its denouncement of the acts of the intolerant groups. Many senior leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have said that incidents like Dadri are unacceptable. In fact, the prime minister has said it more than once in his public speeches.As this piece is being written, morning newspapers say that BJP ally Akali Dal is unhappy with the activity of the fringe since it’s hurting the credibility of the government through irresponsible utterances. The fringe is distracting public attention from all the good work done by the government, it says. The RSS mouthpiece Panchajanya, on the other hand, according to a report in The Indian Express says the Vedas prescribe killing sinners who kill cows. One may agree or disagree with what is being said, but at least there’s a clear stand that’s being taken by the organization here. The BJP leadership’s position is also clear.That’s not the case with the apologists. When writers returned their awards in protest against rising intolerance in the country and killing of rationalists, they were slammed for being silent during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, banning of Salman Rushdie’s Satanic verses and even during the Emergency, and generally being pro-Congress. Facts don’t quite support this allegation, but even if it is true does that justify the attacks on liberal free-thinkers now? The argument, if there’s one, is convoluted indeed. Precedent cannot be an excuse all the time.Are they afraid of taking a stand? That seems to be the case. It exposes their moral and intellectual shallowness. As Naresh Gujral of the Akali Dal says warnings have not worked, the government needs to rein in people making irresponsible statements with action. Would the apologists support the government when it takes such action to protect its credibility? Perhaps they would or they may still find some clever escape route. But the policy of running with the hare and hunting with the hounds does not work for us.
