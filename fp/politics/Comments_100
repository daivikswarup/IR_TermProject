<comment>Is she another Pappu? (Scared to make any decision). Omar is better. At least he does something (even if they are mistakes). </comment>

<comment>Had this Tamasha been going on in a BJP ruled state ehavens would have come down. the intellectual,  secular intelligentsia with the help of the visual media  would have taken BJP to task. Kashmir, minority and special status. The tamasha can go on. PDP has 27 against BJP's 25. Had Mufti been alive today the government would have run. What has changed except Mufti's death. The best possible solution ever is to bring   President's rule and handover administration to the army.</comment>

<comment>when these idiots work for plp .. all they do is politics</comment>

<comment>why mehbooba...why not the bjp call her bluff....</comment>

<comment>Author is right. Mehbooba is only dynastic successor and not dynamic successor.She should know Governance mardonka kaam hai.</comment>

<comment>If she is not sure of the BJP, let her call for fresh elections.</comment>

<comment>Its not for her to call for fresh elections</comment>

<comment>Omer was better cm, jk was pieceful and progressing. Though corruption charges marred his reputation many times.</comment>

<comment>pieceful ??? Hmm.. full of how many pieces ??</comment>

<comment>She is not delaying but don't understand politics. Immatured!</comment>

<comment>Omar bullies Mehbooba because the Abdullah family is out of power.  These were all corrupt people nurtured initial by the Congress party dynasty.</comment>

<comment>mehbooba is actually separatist mentality lady and will talk geelani;s language because she was freed earlier from the hands of terrorists with interference of geelani and a commitment of supporting them else got killed any time. vote politics is at iys worst and to some extent omar is better as he talks straight even it is wrong.</comment>

<comment>Not she, her sister by terrorists.For her father family comes first, nation next.</comment>

<comment>It was her sister Rubaiya. There is  a say about that it was engineered. In fact there has been a movie based on that theme -kohram.</comment>

<comment>Kohram was released in Pakistan? do you get to watch Hindi movies in pakistan or do you indulge in piracy!!</comment>

<comment>So when Mehboob played hard during the first 2 weeks she was making bold decision, now you doubt she has guts?</comment>

<comment>She will only get guts when she will get rid of the greed.</comment>

<comment>Why not Omar join the Government ?</comment>

<comment>She went with her Father when he decided to go with the BJP.May be she had her reservations.Now that she is left to do the decision making,SHe has devloped cold feet.BJP is in no hurry,having seen Delhi and Bihar.The promises made to Jammu like the rest of the Country have proved to be Jumla"s.May be BJP thinks that the people of Jammu are not going to be carried away again with Big talk.Mind you Jammu got a Lions share of the 1000s of crores promised in Flood relief,Drinking water problem was solved,Farmers got 50% price for the produce and Million youths got Job under skill India.BJP need not bother,times and Thinking has changed.They will still win in Jammu hands down</comment>

<comment>O meri mehbooba ... Tujhe jana hai to ja ...Teri marzi mera kya ...</comment>

<comment>If she is scared of terrorists then she must find a MMS equivalent.</comment>

<comment>U think bjpigs are brave?</comment>

<comment>katwa pehle smajho tera baap to hai surreee</comment>

<comment>BJP lions have more courage than Mehbooba.</comment>

<comment>Have u heard of bjpigs?</comment>

<comment>Only one species of pigs in politics.. CON-AAPIGS</comment>

<comment>Blow job party pigs !</comment>

<comment>AAP -CON have changed their name?  You are right that's what they  like from their zombie pig supporters like u</comment>

<comment>She was in a state of mourning - is no excuse either. In a democracy, no state or country can stop functioning for days just for mourning.She just wants to get assembly dismissed by central govt - so she can portray her party as Martyr.</comment>

<comment>we read opinions of reporters more than news.</comment>

<comment>Victimhood and Martyr-hood sells like hot cake in Valley. That is what PDP is trying to achieve by just blaming Center-BJP-Modi and creating a condition where it would appear that it was stubbornness of BJP/Center/Modi which forced another election!The fact is that Mehbooba wants to go to election with at least Congress as alliance partner because if she does not do that Congress and NC are sure to be in alliance for next election and that will be dangerous for PDP. PDP wants to first wash off its “sin of joining hand with “Hindu” BJP first.” And victimhood is the best detergent for that.</comment>

<comment>Strange position adopted by PDP. They could have continued with this arrangement with BJP atleast till the next LS polls. Either before the LS polls or after the LS polls, they could have taken a stand no whether the continue with BJP for the rest of the assembly term. The assembly polls and power in state should be more important for regional parties like PDP and NC. This assembly has 5 more years and what a waste or public money if elections have to be held all over again in a sensitive state like J&K.</comment>

<comment>Why ? To oblige feku because he cant win more elections?</comment>

<comment>Time has come to implement the 3 point formula in Kashmir:1. Carve out Jammu as a state, and Ladakh as a union territory. This will secure 88 % of the land area that can happily integrate with India emotionally and culturally.2. Invest heavily in development of Jammu and Ladakh.3. Put Kashmir under army rule, black out the media and start flushing out the stone pelters - push them across the border chased by bullets and dogs. Stop wasting Indian tax payers' money in Kashmir.</comment>

<comment>But u need 56" ka seena to do this ! Where is that?</comment>

<comment>hey brain dead zombie.. the first point -it needs 2/3rd majaority in RS and LS both..not 56 " ka seena</comment>

<comment>U brain washed shakha student this is what ur bhadva runt used to say na???</comment>

<comment>You are talking about your self and your relatives ? I was speaking what our constitution tells us? </comment>

<comment>Look, if Modi loses power ... it could be Pappu, Nitisswa, Kejru, Mulla M, Mamta or any of the other vote-bankers ! Modi is the last and only hope for Indians !</comment>

<comment>Yes its his last inning !</comment>
