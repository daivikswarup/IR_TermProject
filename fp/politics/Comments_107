<comment>Mr. Advani --considered by many to be the founder and chief mentor of the B J P -- now that India has " elected " an EMPEROR -- Mr Advani better just keep quiet and sit on the sidelines --  and bide his time waiting for the country to revolt against the EMPEROR -- if he does not do so -- he will by " SOME TRICKS/BLUFFS " be sent to the dust bin of India's history -- So dear Mr Advani behave like a politician and smile your way in to oblivion !!!! regards to you</comment>

<comment>Advani Ji secured seat of Lok Sabha from Gandhi Nagar ( Gujara),  for so many years is due to Modi Ji.  Can he win any election outside Gujarat? Do not think so. His rath yantra processions , performances of minister like Shatrughns, advisor like Shaurie did not contribute anything  to win second term for Atal Ji or BJP. So BJP Board gave command to Modi Ji. Despite lost election in Delhi and Bihar, BJP won so many state election  under Amit Ji and Modi Ji, and reaching goal of Congress mukt India do not forget that. Even all opposition get together, total seats remain the same . Each opposition party may have to fight few seats, not all.</comment>

<comment>LK Advani was first elected to Parliment from Gandhi Nagar in the year 1991, way before Modi into active politics.</comment>

<comment>Why react to such hypothetical article by Sanjay Singh? Advani cannot be assumed to be so naive to make such suicidal move, as dreamt by Sanjay.  The real objective of Sanjay is add ghee to the fire (jointly signed letter of BJP veterans) and mobilize people against Modi.</comment>

<comment>I love Shri Advaniji, Shri Murali Manohar Joshiji to call it a day in politics. The new generation does not want people who are 75+. It is a natural phenomenon. Advaniji should keep up his aura of veneration among the old Jansanghis like me.</comment>

<comment>NO. Heavens are not gong to fall if Advaniji criticizes the party. Take it in stride. Though opportunists like Shot Gun can be simply IGNORED.</comment>

<comment>The problem with Advani, and indeed most Indian politiciansin their advanced age, is their inability to come to terms their age and stepaside gracefully and make way for younger leaders. Their lust for power is such that they like to hang on topower to the bitter end. Advani is perhaps a prime example of an elderly man his his twilight years who instead of retiring gracefull is still lusting for power to the extent where he is willing to damage even his own reputation, damage the party and even harm the national interest by weakening the government.</comment>

<comment>He ensured Modis failure.....he was backstabbing right from day 1...indian history is full of these traitors</comment>

<comment>It is obvious that the old guards Of BJP had been relegated to the background and young blood is being injected within BJP rank and file by Modi. Now this massive defeat for BJP in Bihar is is aided by the 'Brutus' of the BJP and his aides ie Advani and Sinha.Ofter Bihar election results, Sinha is openly blowing his trumpet. But it is good for BJP because it is time to weed out for healthy growth. It will be a good sign for BJP if Advani & co come out in the open and take part in the Nitish-Laloo coronation.</comment>

<comment>Dear Advani, You and your cohorts destroyed BJP in Karnataka and Bihar. Please go to Patna and bring an end to the nonsense drama once and for all. You will also be free to keep firing at Modi who became PM in spite of your childish and stupid tantrums.</comment>

<comment>It is nasty of Nitish to fish in troubled waters, particularly with old comrades. Why doesn't he invite George Fernandes first?</comment>

<comment>What is common between Prashant Kishor , Nitish , Mamta? Back stabler and traitors of BJP/NDA who deserted for their own power. Indian history is full of such characters, go back and check. Hope Advani and Sinha does not join them.</comment>

<comment>It is naive to suggest that Advani's  motive is to prove his point. It cannot be denied that it was Advani who brought the BJP cou8nt in the LOKSABHA from 2 to 82. He is a staunch member of the party. But what can he do when the he speaks for the benefit of the party and correct the situation created by the Gujarat Duo. As a faithful BJP member he did not press on his objection on MOdi's projection as the PM. But he is yet loyal and sincere to the party and as senior leader it is his right to raise his concerns in the interest of the party. If the bJP claims to be a democratic party then action against him to dismiss him will be tantamount to rejecting the Vajpayee-Advani philosophy of putting India before party!</comment>

<comment>Concern should be expressed in party forums and not in public.</comment>

<comment>It is ironical how short the public memory is.This person who called LK Advani who pretends today to be a moderate was the one whose pictures are available in plenty on a ' rath' in 1990 and which lead to hundreds of deaths due to riots. He was the architect of the Babri demolition too. He should not try to fool public today by showing any other face.</comment>

<comment>then we should reject BJP totally ?</comment>

<comment>The way Shri L.K.Advani hasstarted behaving; it seems he has a motive. He knows that he has no chance ofcoming up into lime-light under the current dispensation of leaders in theparty and the government. His only chance, should MGB gain momentum until theelection of the next President of India, he could try or expect the MGB toembarrass Modi-Shah by nominating Advaniji as their Presidential candidateafter Shri Pranab Mukherjee demits his office. It is hoped that Advaniji willbe the first and the last aberration in BJP.</comment>

<comment>Advani's only motive is to become PM of the country even if it is for one day before he dies. With one leg already in a grave, he should retire from politics and stop conspiring against the  very party he has nurtured so fondly.</comment>

<comment>no ! he wont get ever selected for that !</comment>

<comment>My point is people of India do not care who you are & who you support Muslims, Hindus, Christians.... We had seen these in the previous elections. Congress came to power twice despite Hindu majority in India recently. BJP's Hindutva slogan did not work. They trusted simply M M  Singh as an economist who could bring development as they did for Vajpayee. When they failed, people brought BJP not because of  Hindutva policy but because of promises of economic development. Modi's economic rhetoric worked during the election in 2013. During M M Singh reign, a friend of mine who is a foreigner in origin asked me why Hindus are not voting for BJP. I said the DNA of India is diversity, people can withstand this sort of political manipulation for votes. They have done this for centuries. Therefore, even today the ones  who  are (more than 90%) returning their awards are Hindus to protect India's identity that is unity in diversity. This will live forever, stand as tall as Eiffel tower in this true democratic country. The divisive politics will die.</comment>

<comment>Your logic that people of India like diversity is not correct fact is Hindus are divided and muslims are voting unitedly. So that excuse is not correct.</comment>

<comment>well power hungry wont let this happen ....</comment>

<comment>Modi---Sickular in Foreign. Communal in India.</comment>

<comment>Wat advaniwants? Become pm at age 90?</comment>

<comment>The problem with BJP Govt appears to be The RSS Agenda which has no buyers and is not valid in Today's world. The young people of India voted BJP on the development plank.and every section of the society understands this...any diviation from it will not be beneficial for the BJP in the future state elections.</comment>

<comment>Exactly right Kamal.</comment>

<comment>Hahaha</comment>

<comment>if BJP does lose in Assam and UP, the rebellion against Modi can get more serious, if BJP wins either of the two, Modi will be safe.</comment>

<comment>Win or lose in Assam and UP Modi is safe. There is no challenge to him for next 10 years. The present 'revolt' by a few disgruntled elements is like a storm in the tea cup. It will die down in no time.</comment>

<comment>With due respect, Advani got a chance last time and he failed to deliver the election. Vajpayee got an opportunity and he excelledand so is Modi. Why to crib?</comment>

<comment>9 whole days since the announcement of Bihar Election results and not a single statement on cow by any BJP/VHP/RSS leader....</comment>

<comment>This is the same old story as far Hindus are concerned. Some 900 years ago, similar infight  happened in Delhi paving way for a very long subjugation by foreigners. It appears that Indians cannot stand being ruled by Indians and they have to create situations where foreigners take charge. Better Italians than IS.</comment>

<comment>BJP represents upper caste(Brahmin, Bania, thakur) and are trying to reach out to other sections of Hindus and succeeded to some extent in 2014 elections, but these are floating votes and such folks voted for Modi for development and growth. If BJP indulges in communalism, casteism and regionalism will also come to the fore.BJP cannot herd Hindus together on the basis of hate/mistrust of muslims, the lower caste(SC/ST/OBC) simply do not care for that agenda. They do care for development and growth though. So BJP is not untouchable, but just herding Hindu votes will not work.</comment>

<comment>This is the same old mistake that bhakths are making which resulted in the severe drubbing of BJP in Delhi and Bihar - the illusion that BJP represents Hindus. Even in its best performance till date, that is in May 2014, the vote share of BJP was around 30 - 31%. That means that a majority of Hindus did not vote for BJP. Why? As a Hindu, i am not comfortable with BJP's divisive and hate politics and for me it is as dangerous, if not more dangerous, than corruption. The fact that BJP is as corrupt as other parties makes this even more alarming. This is exactly why (because of 2002) people did not re-elect Vajpayee govt in 2004 despite what many would say a decent performance record.</comment>

<comment>Advani is 90 years old. The threat the mainstream media is pinning on a man with I'm sorry to say, absolutely no political consistency (he can barely hold onto Gandhinagar and that has been in large part thanks to Modi), who ran the BJP to disastrous results in 2009, the worst results ever since 1989 when the party was still a small party. I respect his work for the party, and if he wants to Nitish swearing in, that is his prerogative. But even with the Bihar loss, Modi has 280+ MPs who owe him their loyalty. Even Shotgun isn't stupid enough to directly attack Modi. Khattar, Fadnavis, Patel, Nirmal Singh and Das owe their CM posts to him. Vasundhara Raje is his long time friend. So let's stop turning a couple of MPs bitter about the Bihar loss and voicing it publicly and some silly letter from BJP elders which wasn't even strongly worded but more of a "come to us for help" plea as some sort of mass rebellion. </comment>

<comment>Advani must attend swearing in and prove once for all that he has been working against the party for last about 5 years.</comment>

<comment>culture  and basic manners !</comment>

<comment>advani will split bjp and bjp will be finished.</comment>

<comment>Advani will be dead in a year or so. He will join Karunanadhani, achuthananand and Badal in the next life very soon</comment>

<comment>young people also die , life and death is in the hands of God !</comment>

<comment>Advani is right,  he is the man  who had helped the party to rise so fast and so strong. Therefore, he is not asking anything which he doesn't deserve or he has not earned. At the moment, he is feeling that he is on the mercy of Gujarat duo, which is not of his liking. Nonetheless he shouldn't go to Patna as it will be a big thing, which his opponents would be looking for since long. It shall give a  chance to his opponents to finish his career once for all. Therefore, the looser will be Advani and it will amount to end of his left over prestige in the party.  The other alternative he is looking for is  to revolt within the party, which will lead to breaking of the party in possible two segment, being Modi's side being strong. However, this will not be good for the country as a whole</comment>

<comment>advani has been ignored and now he realised that bjp to be split into two for the sake of his survival.advani will do maximum harm to bjp-2019 election.</comment>

<comment>please do not kid yourself. The maximum harm to BJP (in 2019) has already been done and will continue to be done by Mr Modi, entire BJP and an equal contribution by bhakths.</comment>

<comment>Err... Sonia ghandhy n advani still alive in4 yrs time?</comment>

<comment>I know buddy U r missing mummy ... no scams, NGO squeeze n close eye on anti-nationals must be hurting .. India loves Modi ... U can move to heaven Porkistan with ur beloved Pappu n Khujli</comment>

<comment>The younger generation feels that Advani sold party interests to Sonia during UPA to safeguard his own interests. Advani has not been able change that opinion. Now whatever he does is only perceived as negative.</comment>

<comment>you attended that meeting ?</comment>

<comment>show becoming PM is his personal ambition still now.....</comment>

<comment>just to hit back at pm modi on personel  level advaniji has stooped to this level one could never ever imagine that such a learned erudite founder member of the bjp could be so petty</comment>

<comment>nobody can stoop as low as Mr Modi or be as petty as him. Mr Advani is playing a political game just like everyone else is, why blame him alone?</comment>

<comment>why a 90+ man advani should aspire a political career? doesn't he want to leave it for younger generation? one is china where everyone above 50 quits politics and leaves space for younger, other is india where even 80 or 90+ will aspire better career so that they could use govt facilities till they die....most of the time they stay in hospitals at govt expenses and wish that people can meet them there and keep on sending consolatory messages....</comment>

<comment>vow FP creates POST from nothing</comment>

<comment>Hi Roopesh! Good one mate! Easily the best one!</comment>

<comment>Why ? you posted here !!</comment>

<comment>What is the harm in Advani attending the swearing in ceremony at Bihar?Should not the loser in the election  shake hands with the winner and wish him good luck and say together we will make better Bihar. The problems crop up when the losers hold a grudge and become vengful.</comment>

<comment>An uneducated  sycophantic man will not be able to understand this simple thing :D</comment>

<comment>The name and image tells it all.</comment>

<comment>you seem to be cured :D</comment>

<comment>the rebels can decide who their future is with a spent force with little forward looking agenda but or a nationalist with a vision who wants the nation to become a development one with appeasement for none. and if they think the people are with advani then you've seen the result of losing out to upa for 10 years.</comment>

<comment>Shri L.K.ADVANI MUST BE GIVEN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CABINET POST EITHER PM or Deputy Prime Minister POST. IT WILL BE FITTING TO HONOUR THIS GREAT LEADER .WHO MODI WISHES TO BANISH HIM FROM HIS SIGHT. HE Advani took and PUSHED THE BJP RIGHT TO THE TOP , and those WHO HAVE BENIFITED ARE TRYING TO SHUNT HIM and the other GREAT BJP LEADERS AWAY to the back room.Mr ADVANI SHOULD BE MADE DEPUTY PM or EVEN PRIME MINISTER OF BHARAT.JAI ADVANI</comment>

<comment>Post of PM should not be given as " honour". People have elected Modi as PM , not BJP or Advani. He should get full freedom to work [even if he turns out to be politically wrong]. What better has Advani done in his career, to say Modi is wrong, just after defeat in two state elections? Old people do not want to let young generation work in a changed world.</comment>

<comment>We do not have  presidential form of elections !</comment>

<comment>BJP is party with ideas.  What you are suggesting is congressification of BJP.With Modi as the leader of BJP, this will not happen.</comment>

<comment>Modi Hai !! hai !!!....bahar jai !!</comment>

<comment>Even in home Son gets more active when father gets older and maintains their home and family. Advani in in 90s. Don't you think the age also matters specially to maintain this big country in this modern, fast and young age world.I am not against Modi and advani.But the age of Advaniji to govern India has been passed.</comment>

<comment>THEN let Advani Ji decide who is the best man  for PM post !!!</comment>

<comment>People will decide, not Advani, not Sonia, not Lalu,not Mulayam,Not Mufti etc. Unfortunately this is happening in Indian Democracy. It looks like modern style of same ruling like King & his generation by generation ruled in ancient time for years and years.</comment>

<comment>because he knows the DNA of the party and what is good for the party !</comment>

<comment>Not only Advaniji knows All workers,leaders,supporters knows DNA well.</comment>

<comment>no  they dont  !</comment>

<comment>I FULLY SUPPORT !!</comment>

<comment>Bhaiyaji.  Advanji wants to reap the fruits of his hard work.  Rat yatra and hard speeches and what not and Modiji, took all ....come on lets be reasonable</comment>

<comment>Modi is a good leader.</comment>

<comment>Good leader to spoil everything!</comment>

<comment>hhahahah...lovely :)</comment>

<comment>Ok.Now I have got.You are suffering from Modifobia. I thought you were logical and neutral person. I have wasted time. Thank you.</comment>

<comment>he is ranting early morning for ranting sake</comment>

<comment>and what are you doing ?  preaching holy scriptures here ??</comment>

<comment>you have given up even before you started :D</comment>

<comment>Kya karu Ram muze ye Buddha mil gaya!!!</comment>

<comment>Advani has had his time in the BJP. One can sympathise with him  in that he could never become PM and Vajpayee always overshadowed him. But it was more  his  own hawkish reputation, as against Vajpayee's statesmanlike and erudite demeanour, that denied him  the top post, though the BJP owes the growth from 2 MPs to over 150 entirely to him. That was in the 1990s. In 2014, it was undoubtedly and entirely Modi and Shah who raised the bar and took it to 282, NOT a mean achievement by any standards. Now, in view of his age, Advani should gracefully retire and allow the present leadership to carry on, mistakes, misjudgments and all. The greater danger is in the fact that people like Aroon Shourie and Shatru  feel emboldened to rock the boat and even ensure a defeat in 2019. And 'that' will be a thousand pities.</comment>

<comment>Correctly said mate!</comment>

<comment>modi and shah  did nothing to raise the bar !! It was congress's massive failure that  gave them an automatic raise!!</comment>

<comment>Exactly....!</comment>

<comment>If that was the case, Advani should have taken advantage in 2009 and done this. He had a congress government full of corruption that was literally a train wreck and the Communists outside support literally set the thing on fire, and he led the BJP to its worst result in 2 decades. It was en election that made him realize people just don't like him.</comment>

<comment>INTENSITY .....know the difference</comment>

<comment>Yes.   The BJP,  its supporters and well wishers owe a LOT to Sonia, Rahul, Priyanka and the likes of the infamous 'chaiwallah' Mani Iyer  for the surge.</comment>

<comment>Sack this stupid oldie. He is a gone case and no more than a deranged kid.His mind is full with venom and envy for the new successful leaders of BJP and he is unable to digest in spite of their treating him with respect. In his wildest of the dreams he could not have got the success that Modi has won for the party. He has already lost much of the respect with his repeated Childish acts. No one is going to bother about this hawala fame oldie with a dead Brain.</comment>

<comment>we  feel every one in BJP has gone crazy  :P</comment>

<comment>We can see 1969 being repeated, Parivar instead of Congress. Indra Congress was born in 1969. May be Modi Parivar will be formed throwing out all old guards.</comment>

<comment>If the old guards work for the opposition then nothing else can be done.  If the old guards are not able to win elections, why should they serve as  the guards.</comment>

<comment>Earlier this not happned...but now a days I see even Tamils started depositing their brains in the Nagpur locker..:)</comment>

<comment>Is it all about winning elections ? Why not have military rule in India they can win by guns easily !!</comment>

<comment>ITS TIME WE AS INDIAN UNDER STANDWHAT MESSAGE IS IN THIS PICTURE</comment>

<comment>HI</comment>

<comment>Shri L.K.Advani is a VERY RESPECTED LEADER OF THE BJP ,Single handed HAS TAKEN THE BJP TO GREAT HEIGHTS.  Despite the fact modi with the Gujurat riots defamed the Party even Shri A.B.Vajpai had to CAUTION Shri Modi this was viewed by one all the PEOPLE OF INDYA.NOW TO DISCARD Shri Advani and the four other great LEADERS of the BJP IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. THE RESULTS OF DELHI AND BIHAR HAS SHOWN THAT BJP IS SLIDING DOWN FAST.A FULL COURSE CORRECTION IS NEEDED. DESPITE WHAT THE OTHER BJP LEADERS or Past Presidents may say.Shri L.K Advani MUST BE GIVEN A VERY POST IN THE GOVT either THE PM or DEPUTY PM POST TO REVIVE THE BJP.HOPE SENSE WILL PREVAIL.Jai Advani Jai Sinha, Muraliji</comment>

<comment>KeepItHonest -- Congress is defending Rahul-baba over citizenship of various foreign countries because fake gandhis are keys to loot money routed to congress office  bearers from india and abroad. It is all about the money. This is how PVNR was ditched even when he lost with much lesser margin to BJP than fake Gandhis loss this time. THEY PUNISHED HIM so badly after all that he gave to the nation.  They were shedding false tears that Congress is going bankrupt while buying sycophants. This shows COngress has no morals. All thanks fake gandhis loot money and their backing from foreign agencies that allows them to buy sycophants in all sorts of parties(including congress) and also buy those business brokers, babus and OF-COURSE THE media and intelligentsia.  WHen BJP came to power during the first term, the looters of congress formed a bjp-congress loot cartel to share the loot and recently also routed foreign money to form fake opposition such as AAP. That loot cartel is still in business with triple agents like Advani, MMS, jaitley, vadras, Pappu, Sonia, etc.</comment>

<comment>This media person is midiocre in his attempt. BJP is going through a generational change, which is dificult,but is essential,and inevitable in an evolving and futuristic party. Most of the other parties in india mainly congress do not have this problem. That is because the ruler rules till death or defeated. See the congress,every one of their rulers ruled till death or defeated. Then there is the next one in dynasty to take over.Now comening to advany he was given a chance even though he is a known autocrate and completly steborn and country did not trust him. The gujarat duo gave him shelter in gujerat for his reelectons. In present situation bjp has Options,they can siply ignore him,and if he pushes it let him expose himself like when he got in to anger house and resigned everthing when modi was given charge of the party. So media man what are you getting at? A juicy fight in the party? It is not going to happen.</comment>

<comment>Guys, do you really feel that Advani matters? What do we remember him for? Jethmalani,Shourie, Advani are the people who are not in sync with the times.Mahagathbandhan in Bihar won because NDA couldn’t win over the casteist arithmetic.Did you not want Modi to win, Do you really disapprove of his actions, Does anyonehas the answer, How are we contributing to the change we want to see?</comment>

<comment>If this is the reality who stopped them to think and make a proper strategy accordingly ??</comment>

<comment>What proper strategy was there? Yadav voter was going to vote Yadav, Kurmi was going to vote Kurmi. Bihari is a 90% rural state - policy debates are of little interest outside of urban areas. Once Lalu and Nitish combined, it was an uphill battle.</comment>

<comment>Indian National Congress is indeed Islamic National Congress with Christian leadership.  You are absolutely correct about Mani Shankar Aiyar.</comment>

<comment>Dear Mr.Dump please explain the role of rss in India's freedom struggle. Rss was a pet d*g of Indira Gandhi until her death and rss was pampered and fed at her backyard. After her death, since no one take care of these thugs, they actively involved politics of hatred thru a back door (thru bjp) process...and rss was started to secure the interests of Brahmins initially and if you see in Tamilnadu also from spic to India cements to TVs to everything is controlled by bhahmins whom contribute not even 2% of Tamilnadu population, but controls almost 90% of the industrial houses....:)</comment>

<comment>bang on !!</comment>

<comment>THESE STATEMENTS ARE DISGRACEFUL. JUST Garbbage . NO ONE IN SOUND MIND SAY SUCH RUBBISH .WHY DO PEOPLE ACCUSED THE CHRISTIANS IT BEEN SEEN SO OFTEN WITHOUT EVEN A SHREED OF PROOF or BLAME THE Other minorities. JUST TONE DOWN THESE HATE CAMPAIGN AGAINST CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS OR EVEN DALIT. ITS BECAUSE THESE MINORITIES DO NOT HIT BACK.ITS BECOME THE HABIT OF SOME Psychotic Members of India making such HORRIBLE STATEMENTS >WITH THE HOPE SOME THING DRAMATIC WILL CHANGE THE COURSE OF INDYA.OUR COUNTRY IWILL BE DOOMED IF SUCH PEOPLE GO UNPUNISHED WITH THESE HATE CRIMES.JAI BHARATMATA Jai gandhiji</comment>

<comment>It is actually true that Congress has worked against the nation. Even a cursory glance through history will prove that. Saying "JAI BHARATMATA Jai gandhiji" doesn't change anything.Look at Asian nations like South Korea, China, Taiwan and what they have achieved. Every single individual, especially the poor, should strive to get a government that will work for development and job creation. The hollow talk in the same of Secularism and so-called Intolerance will not achieve anything.If people do not realise, and let politicians take advantage of their stupidity/ignorance, they will keep suffering like BIHARIS. And the rich-poor divide will keep getting bigger and bigger. It is high time Indians got rid of this Leftist mentality and wake up to the economic and socio-political realities.Efficient capital markets,minimal taxes with strong assessment and collection mechanism, reduction in subsidies, rethink on caste based reservations, uniform civil code, land reforms, labour reforms, strong law and order, strong national security, efficient military intelligence, strategic foreign policy etc are the need of the hour.The pseudo-secularists have delivered none of these. The present day youth is more interested in development that sulking eighty-nine year old politician!Why can't Advani just retire? I am pretty sure he cannot even comprehend the present day issues. Saying things like emergency, dictatorship etc will only damage him further.And all who think Advani is still worth something are idiot. Elders should retire gracefully. I would not want my future or the future of  nation to be scripted by politicians who will not be around to face the consequences of their actions. Time we Indians rethink politics!And yeah I will not say Jai Gandhiji; not because I don't respect him but because he would have never wanted me to say that EVER.Please start living Gandhi instead of invoking him to oppose everything.</comment>

<comment>You do not seem to have any idea of how the Congress party functions.  Your political correctness will lead to legal errors and moral turpitude in society.</comment>

<comment>where you PA of Rajiv or Sonia to have a complete idea of how Congress party functions? Or do you know how the bjp functions?  Here in Kerala until last week bjp protested against a minister for his corruption charges and this minister is thrown out of the congress party now and now bjp is begging at it's knees for an Allianz with this person...:)</comment>

<comment>you know too much !!</comment>

<comment>His brain has been taken out and fixed with a chip which has some pre-recorded messages. He is not acting as his own, everything pre-recorded and pre-programmed at Nagpur from rss headquarters...he will keep ranting until the battery is down...:)</comment>

<comment>Advani has no support within the party he has already lowered his stature by not supporting Narendra Modi as leader in 2013, he can feel elated by Bihar result that is temporary.</comment>

<comment>Advani may be dead or comatose tomorrow to be perfectly honest so the rebellion with him at the helm is hilarious</comment>

<comment>nice  assumption !!</comment>

<comment>Advani has no stature within the party.</comment>

<comment>Advani is a spent force within the party.  He is just shouting to draw some attention.</comment>

<comment>I dont see that he is elated or down. He is playing his cards like all triple agents play.</comment>

<comment>Hykum--U are right. If there is outbreak of deadly war between China, India due to Nepal and Pakistan.  There are nations of world who will look to turn the  bloodshed and chaos as opportunity to convert  and to have more economic control.  Quite like in Sri-lanka war between tamils and sinhalese weaponized and funded from foreign forces led to quick conversion of the fallen followed by their immigration as persecuted. Even Rajiv fake Gandhi had fallen to foreign designs as well as his family was also getting weapons kickbacks. Not saying that this conversion and economic colonization is not happening even today in India due to economic lure directly by conversion agencies(be it from middle-east, Europe or elsewhere). Or, via their foreign business-corporation having olive arm for converts and those brown sahib indian corporation-business , brokers of videshi business, aid agencies, etc. Nepal is in grips of such tactics as is Lanka and many smaller nations around. Bangladeshi  radicals deter this to certain extent as they recently killed an Italianmissionary in Dhaka. Gorkas recruited by colonizer made inroad into Nepal easier for conversion and now Maoist and maoist influenced in India and Nepal look for funds and weapons are also target for conversion by all 3 middle-east religions. For maoist see colonized forces of India and Nepal as representatives of HHindus-India and see them as representative of HHindus-Nepals. thus they develop grudge against their native religion(hindu)and nation making them target of conversion. this happened in Nagaland and elsewhere where insurgents were trained/armed by their converters to call Indian forces as indian ddogs. They dont see that forces in their nation as legacy of colonial system and national leadership that refuses to de-colonize.</comment>

<comment>Please let him use it...we have had enough of sour grapes from this old has been..it is time he was given the boot for his anti party activities.Dear advaniji, many an intellectual has been bought down by their own humongous ego, and sadly, that is the same for you..obviously egoism does not reconganize age as a metric and maturity has long since flown the coop. Allow me to point out the fact that even if you stoop to attending  nitish''s coronation and top it by attending pappu''s coronation as the congress president, if that ever happens, it still would not matter one whit..we just don't care about what you plan to do, either now, or in the near future.Please shut the door on your way out of psyche and don''t let it hit you on your "khulji"..</comment>

<comment>Change is the unchangeable law of Nature!Just 20 months back, each one of us saw, Modi touching the feet of Advani!Today Modi cares two hoots for Advani!</comment>

<comment>it is not with jesus/allah. it has to do with bunch of people who like to dominate and proliferate and control under guise of religion. And sometime via political ideology and more.</comment>

<comment>It is the doctrine that is important because the religious people follow it and commit all frauds.</comment>

<comment>Too much Opposition to Modi is not good. Modi needs to sober down and be more inclusive in his approach. However, people both within and outside BJP need to allow Modi to work. Everyday throwing hurdles in the way of Modi is not good. Not good for India for sure</comment>

<comment>"Modi needs to sober down and be more inclusive in his approach".Inclusive Modi. That is an oxymoron.</comment>

<comment>You have a point</comment>

<comment>So you believe  Modi can change ? :P</comment>

<comment>good question</comment>

<comment>You should have been heavily traumatized by the Congress party administrations.</comment>

<comment>so does it give him the right to traumatize us more ?</comment>

<comment>Why? why should he become a casetists racist asss licker like you?</comment>

<comment>You are saying that the Congress party is not racist!  That is the joke of the century.  The Nehru dynasty members were holding on to power because they are all Caucasian in appearance.  You should have some sense of shame in voting for them without any considerations for competence, integrity and merit.</comment>

<comment>what is he now ?</comment>

<comment>Still no Firstpost coverage on Rahul-baba's British citizenship for the 2nd day running. Not a single article on the issue. Firstpost has completely censored the story.</comment>

<comment>Avnesh--- Modi has chaiwala dreams  to travel in plane whether sarkari or from Ambani and wear nice dress. But MMS who pursued World bank and IMF policies was not chaiwala, he had secure job all his life. though both MMS and Modi are from bjp-congress loot cartel with AAP is their fake opposition.</comment>

<comment>The Congress poarty and the Nehru dynasty has the same dream and they also want to keep all the Indians at tea shop manager's levels -- uneducated, poor, and powerless.</comment>

<comment>Yes. Written about bjp-congress loot cartel below and their fake opposition like AAP. As i said to KeepItHonest -- Congress is defending Rahul-baba over citizenship of various foreign countries because fake gandhis are keys to loot money routed to congress office  bearers from india and abroad. It is all about the money. This is how PVNR was ditched even when he lost with much lesser margin to BJP than fake Gandhis loss this time. THEY PUNISHED HIM so badly after all that he gave to the nation.  They were shedding false tears that Congress is going bankrupt while buying sycophants. This shows COngress has no morals. All thanks fake gandhis loot money and their backing from foreign agencies that allows them to buy sycophants in all sorts of parties(including congress) and also buy those business brokers, babus and OF-COURSE THE media and intelligentsia.  WHen BJP came to power during the first term, the looters of congress formed a bjp-congress loot cartel to share the loot and recently also routed foreign money to form fake opposition such as AAP. That loot cartel is still in business with triple agents like Advani, MMS, jaitley, vadras, Pappu, Sonia, etc.</comment>

<comment>that is why MMS was totally useless -  he had no dreams no aspirations except to assslick for his seat and high position!</comment>

<comment>It is still too early to judge NDA with UPA 1 &  2. But Narendra Modi has already made an early head start compared to the crony capitalist rule.n It was really hard for MMS to stop the 2g,cwg, coal scam etc. ............</comment>

<comment>No, no, no. You go tit wrong. Narendra Modi has made himself the best Indian "export". He has already exported himself to oover 30 countries.</comment>

<comment>Ok, oath taking ceremony is a good occasions. It is above politics. So i wonder why did Nitish not invite Modi , the PM himself ?If it was Modi in Nitish's place, he would have done that.Thisshows Nitish can never become a statesman like Modi. ....and he is thinking to e PM lol...LOL</comment>

<comment>Nitish didn't invite because he wants PM ji to work. Anyways PM is either very busy campaigning or out of india on foreign trips. </comment>

<comment>He invited AK .. So he can have a KitKat break..in his BUSY schedule</comment>

<comment>So nitish does not want the other ppl be invited to work? </comment>

<comment>Like Modi did not invite AK for 26th Jan and later he had to request to have  a parade organized in Delhi to the CM of Delhi as  an official protocol :PThat must have made many BJP people consume burnol :D</comment>

More then 35 people died due to dengue..but Kejri wanted to have a concert of Ghulam Ali... did rock concert for DU polls etc.. he is enjoying lyf as a aam admi... no janlok pal bill , free wifi, 15 lakh cctv, women commando etc.  till date... In 2014 Kejriwal ridiculed the entire nation mocking it by saying that Republic Day is mere get together of VIPs sitting and enjoying tableau's.... he in fact went on to say that he will do dharna and disrupt it. n asked aaptards for support....  n after that he cries that he was not given an invite.... what kind of hypocrisy is this..... ?? n Republic day celebrations belongs to the whole of India and not to Delhi only and nowhere in the world, such a shameful act has been committed....n Mayank Gandhi rightly said that AAP doing gutter politics....</comment>

<comment>Please, we all know the jumlas ak did during 26th. No one cares about ak now man. Its nitish. Ak committed political suicide...</comment>

<comment>because you feel  so ?? who are you ??</comment>

<comment>Ooh does the aaptard want to have a logical discussion about this?  Instead of posing why don't you talk facts. It's obvious that nitish will project himself as the next pm candidate. Ak is done unless you are unrealistic...</comment>

<comment>you love to assume ? you should join the IB or RAW because you can perceive things which are not  even planned for :D</comment>

<comment>And you have no clue. Run along aaptard. Send someone who actually understands politics...</comment>

<comment>Hukum Singh -- Do u think conversion will stop like it did in Tibet when Chinese take over. Can India takeover and reverse conversion??CONVERSION By colonial money  economics and immigration economics.  this is why we have been saying Indian regions to un-colonize themselves.news-- india-doesn-t-require-dream-merchants-but-a-leadership-with-a-vision by Sitaram yechury.DREAM MERCHANTS aka crafty sales and marketing using tons of loot money that bjp-congress loot cartel has accumulated. And with loot money have fake opposition like AAP. Major work done by these netas is to make loot cartel backer make more money and call it public service.Back to non-dream non-colonial world that india needs and yet colonized indians are unwilling to break out  and stopping rest of india from breaking away from enslaved colonial world.INDIA needs old beautiful UN-COLONIZED India more than old beautiful india needs us.Atleast bring back that basic spirit before concepts of brutal organized religion from middle-east arrived. The very basic spirit of cashless cooperatives ( cashlesscooperatives . blogspot . in ) given to old India by Rishis is that FOOD is free whether farmer gets it from forest(preferred in old time) or from his farm. And in return we give our tools, goods, services, protection to farmer for free. Farmers in old time were disciples of Rishis and villages were extension of Rishi Ashrams where forest has been cleared. While Rishis continued to stay in Ashrams within the forest living ascetic life. Concept of old Kingly Cities or today’s so called urban world was to keep them very specific (keeping their numbers to minimal) to their task and their task was to offer protection to villages and adhere to guidelines and task assigned by Rishis for both cities and villages. I am sure Rishis in Independent India would not be like colonial money-greed driven Netas, Corporates and Babus. They would ask for more R & D in cities and villages to make villages and region around the powerhouse again through very small scale cashless cooperatives and improve indian security to make it not dependent on videshi who indirectly provide same equipment or technology to enemies.  Not mega-scale or medium scale factories. ROLE OF CITIES was not recreation and entertainment like Small tv, bollywood, etc.India will get more colonized as day passes. Loot cartel and loot money will guide us into drudgery in name of growth, jobs, progress, sophistication, etcUnless india taking path breaking indian way of // cashlesscooperatives . blogspot . in // where even electrical power is produced at village level. Not for luxury (tv, toys) but for basics. And we do not need mega plants (so called mean machines and efficient educated and un-educated slaves), we need very very small scale cashless cooperatives at village level to meet all needs of those in and around villages. Leading to de-urbanization, de-congestion, de-pollution, de-stress, end of slums, end of slavery , environment protection and more.. People and Government that are in coherence with environment will want to have population per their available resources and not destroying the natural forest and polluting environment (including rivers) for excess population. Certain countries who are overzealous with population growth attack nations around under various guise including religion or infiltrate using humanitarian and different channels.</comment>

<comment>Yeah! Always thought ancient indian as a society following Scientology.</comment>

<comment>Are you dragging the ancient Indians down to the level of a despised cult?</comment>

<comment>Well, they are despised by many today, right? </comment>

<comment>Not until the RSS came over and annoyed the $shit out of everyone with their ancient Indian glory crap. No one cared until then.</comment>

<comment>If jesus/allah minded their business like a sikh/budh, no hindu would have given a fck!</comment>

<comment>Again, that glory crap was first started by those abrahamic-invasive religions. </comment>

<comment>Was not meant for u...withdraw my comments.</comment>

<comment>Our Rishis were better than Scientology because their driver was Ataman and not science. For they cared least if science was  derivative of it.</comment>

<comment>Really man! We are just mindless consumers today!The concept of soul is really important!</comment>

<comment>I read that and I thought holy babaji. Consumers, rishis, etc.</comment>

<comment>the mentality of India is not like chinese or even pakistan. The Chinese drew war plan on India in 1960s and acted on it.</comment>

<comment>Greatest Marketing PM ever --Quite like Tibet. Chinese and foreign nations (who convert) are feeding the Nepali chicken to make it their food, unlike India. Nepalis are our relatives. Though many nepalis and indians have forgotten this in hate and for sake of chinese making chicken out of  them.Wanting and wanting. Is pakistan not doing the same with USA and China and many more nations. But certain nations have plans in place for pakistan, not India.</comment>

<comment>In Diplomacy 1 + 1 is not always two. You do your best, but so are the Chinese and the Pakis doing. So how do you control the outcome?And it is well know that the Nepal Constitution making was largely tutored by European nations who would like to dilute India's influence in Nepal as a prelude to conversions. Nepal is becoming Christian at a fast clip in the Hills. The Madhesis , of course, are and will remain staunchly Hindu. So expect a Hindu- Christian power struggle In Nepal in near future.</comment>

<comment>--  If there is outbreak of deadly war between China, India due to Nepal and Pakistan.  There are nations of world who will look to turn the  bloodshed and chaos as opportunity to convert  and to have more economic control.  Quite like in Sri-lanka war between tamils and sinhalese weaponized and funded from foreign forces led to quick conversion of the fallen followed by their immigration as persecuted. Even Rajiv fake Gandhi had fallen to foreign designs as well as his family was also getting weapons kickbacks. Not saying that this conversion and economic colonization is not happening even today in India due to economic lure directly by conversion agencies(be it from middle-east, Europe or elsewhere). Or, via their foreign business-corporation having olive arm for converts and those brown sahib indian corporation-business , brokers of videshi business, aid agencies, etc. Nepal is in grips of such tactics as is Lanka and many smaller nations around. Bangladeshi  radicals deter this to certain extent as they recently killed an Italianmissionary in Dhaka. Gorkas recruited by colonizer made inroad into Nepal easier for conversion and now Maoist and maoist influenced in India and Nepal look for funds and weapons are also target for conversion by all 3 middle-east religions. For maoist see colonized forces of India and Nepal as representatives of HHindus-India and see them as representative of HHindus-Nepals. thus they develop grudge against their native religion(hindu)and nation making them target of conversion. this happened in Nagaland and elsewhere where insurgents were trained/armed by their converters to call Indian forces as indian ddogs. They dont see that forces in their nation as legacy of colonial system and national leadership that refuses to de-colonize.</comment>

<comment>This seems like a Supernatural episode. LOL.</comment>

<comment>But sure churches do not direct atheist govts' actions.But They can see an opportunity in a expansionist govt. </comment>

<comment>The churches are still power ful in politics, And the Westerners assuage their atheistic guilt by large donations to Churches. The main expansionists are the protestant Lutherans in Germany, scandinavia and Baptists in the USA.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, the church are lobbyists too! Damn! </comment>

<comment>yeah. they are banging the targets in Middle-east as they think these will be future zones for economic venture and conversion. Same reason for imports/immigration. But that is policy and reality will come to surface in few decades. And as U said, lot of economic lure conversion in Nepal as well from behind Maoist backing or directly.</comment>

<comment>The economics (jobs, aid, immigration) is a very powerful tool to convert.</comment>

<comment>But, we know what islam is! And i bet west too knows what islam is?West is more likely to convert than they convert islam. No kidding!I think its pure economics. Atleast for West it is! </comment>

<comment>they are banging the targets in Middle-east as they think these will be future zones for economic venture and conversion. Same reason for imports.

<comment>response moved above.</comment>

<comment>Dr BadAss-- I have added few facts due to your concerns.yes, Chinese have plans TO EXPLOIT FEARS OF nepal just like they did with Pakistan and to certain extent with lanka..  And thus take them over like Tibet.  just like Tibet,  cHINA CAN  take over Nepal as WELL IN GUISE OF PROTECTING THEM.   THIS IS WHY INDIA has to serious draw a plan for this eventuality with our Indian forces and with foreign forces. Because Pakistan will join with china when war happens. And we cannot make mistake of 1960. Nuclear weapons possession by all sides will prevent all sides from using it as long everyone has plenty of them. thus war will be conventional. AND ALL THIS NEED indian LEADERSHIP.  Not this trader marketing and sales types over the media leadership like that of bjp-congress loot cartel and their fake opposition AAP. </comment>

<comment>To all those shameless Indians who are opposing India in favour of Nepal, here are a few facts to know:1. The Terai of Nepal is called Madhesh. It is historically indian territory which was transferred to Nepal just about 200 years back by the British.2. Madhesis are Ethnic Indians who have Roti-Beti relation with UP / Bihar across an open border.3. While Madhesh is just about 20% of Nepal, it contains more than 50% of population and produces 75% of Nepal's GDP.4. All Roads and communications must pass through madhesh. If Nepal loses Madhesh, the only way to travel between various parts is by air.5. Nepal has adopted a curious constitution as per which Madhesh, while having more than 50 % population, gets only 30% seats in parliament. In a population based proper representation, Madhesh would have got majority of seats.^. Madhesi provinces have been combined with hills in such a way that the Pahari seats are always numerically more thus ensuring that even the provinces will be ruled by minority Pahari.For all the sabre rattling by nepal it is a simple fact that Chinese goods, even by railways, will be four times more expensive than Indian. Nepal's poor economy will collapse within days.Due to Roti Beti relation, Madhesis will always be loyal to India but the same cannot be said for paharis. In a two front war with Pak / China, India needs to have a neutral / friendly Nepal.China doesn't give a damn about Nepal and already considers it within Indian sphere of influence. In case China plays Hanky panky, the Tibet card will be activated. Nepal is completely infilterated by RAW and most Ministers are on RAW payroll. The Indian ambassador in kathmandu is more important than Nepal PM. So it is only a matter of time before Nepal gives in. India, of course, doesn't mind Nepali politicians doing a bit of political posturing for domestic consumption.In case of a stubborn Nepal, a well funded, well armed insurgency may erput in Madhesh anytime. How long will Nepal last in such a case???</comment>

<comment>So what will you prapose? Play like british to nepal and bring our econamical and secular game to nepal?</comment>

<comment>While Madhesh is just about 20% of Nepal, it contains more than 50% of populationMadhesi provinces have been combined with hills in such a way that the Pahari seats are 'always' numerically moreCan you please give an example how the two facts above reconcile with each other.FYI: Support India, not Nepal. But this has been a major failure for Modi.</comment>

<comment>And I agree with the failure part. It appears that Nepals, egged by China, were successful in Giving India a false sense of Comfort. On eve of constitutional promulgation, a desperate India dispatched the Foreign Secretary to kathmandu, but of no avail. So huge failure no doubt.</comment>

<comment>They reconcile because while Madhesh has one constituency per 30000 population, Pahad has per 8000 population. So that even if Paharis are only 30% in a state, they will control 60% of seats and control the Government.</comment>

<comment>That sound really discriminatory. Can you please provide a good link to read about this matter. (proper news org not niticentral or swarajya etc.)</comment>

<comment>India Can learn some lessons how USA manages Pakistan who always ventures into Chinese and Saudi trash-can of thrown away food. USA even calls the leaders of certain nations to talk before whipping parts of their country. has to do with long established psychological advantage through carrot and hammer.

<comment>News-Pak-army-chief-Raheel-Sharif-in-US-amid-anti-terror-mood-across-world. clever Pak army chief went un-invited. And he would do the same for China.Seems pakistan also has in it's blood the nature to be a triple agent and be opportunist by nature.  Whichever religion(including atheism)  or nationality or doctrine or language they may join.. They would as usual want Pakistan to be considered on the side which is the super-power. Whether it was iislamic crusaders in past and now the west. And it can change anytime.</comment>

<comment>China is already managing Nepal, you gasbag</comment>

<comment>Is Yuan the new currency of Nepal ?</comment>

<comment>No. But Yuan can be easily converted into Nepalese currency.</comment>

<comment>--read above. Chinese have plans TO EXPLOIT FEARS OF nepal just like they did with Pakistan and to certain extent with lanka..  And thus take them over Tibet.  just like Tibet</comment>

<comment>So the next plan of Chinese would be to take out the natural barrier of Himalayas by planting some dynamites and bombs ?Nepalese leaders are shrewd . They want to extract maximum from India by showing closeness to chinese.</comment>

<comment>Dr. Badass -- India Can learn some lessons how USA manages Pakistan who always ventures into chinese and Saudi trash can of thrown away food.Us trying to discipline Nepal will make it worse.

Are they Pluralistic ?</comment>

<comment>written above.</comment>

<comment>One has to make very difficult choices as a voter in India. It is not about who is better, but who is less worse. That's the yardstick I use, unfortunately. BJP is right at the bottom of the list for me because it does not believe in a pluralistic India, so there is no scope for even hoping it will behave differently in power.</comment>

<comment>budhaau sathiyaa gaya hain</comment>

<comment>Advani and his core gang triple agent mindset is due to INSECURITY, greed and opportunism. His core gang of triple agents includes jaitley, MMS, vadras, etc.</comment>

<comment>Ok..a question and lets see how you guys analyze it...more a Psychology than political.Why people hate Modi even though he talks development and has shown results, may be he is also less corrupt  but people like more leaders like Mamta, who do not talk or work development.Modi is still not a ideologue like Mamta or lalu for whom people have some kind of blind faith, Modi has to do lot of shouting, propaganda to get attention but Mamta enjoys trust without doing much.If people have started questioning Modi after 18 months then why they do not question Mamta after 5 yrs.This is not a political question but I want to understand the mind of people that why they like some leaders more than others.</comment>

<comment>Great. A question well posed is solution 90% done. The point is BJP CANNOT do what others do. That is because socialist parties will one day establish their single party/family dictatorships overs fragments of India. that is because socialism HAS to lead to single party dictatorship in long run - as it is legal robbery.----------------------------------------------------------------------How does BJP get Hindus out of STABLE vote bank reservation politics? That is the question.I am not against Modi but he has to understand that 10000 steps forward is better than one step backward.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Jo dar gaya samjo who mar gaya. Did Modi commit suicide when he told that BJP is not for removal reservations? -Then automatically the psychological field of battle was left open to competition between Laloo and Nitish! Modi simple became an extra. Opportunism only helps who are thugs - who want to make quick buck.The master strategists of BJP should understand that - it is virtually impossible to predict on who is going to vote whom. Be moral, walk a thousand steps forward instead of retreating, or not starting at all. Trust in God even if you dont believe in God BECAUSE of unpredictability.I would laugh my head off If anyone said India was a democracy - it is a Ocholocracy [Rule by mobs]. Reservation stable vote banks has made it that way - and constituion of India is responsible, as it started from wrong premise of equality [very negative thinking]. Also Socialism introduced into constitution is legal robbery unlike charity.--------------------------------------------------------------------------BJP/RSS should bring :1)free gun laws so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun lawsCAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Free gun laws are safe2)capitalism to increase size of cake3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks4)Removing reservation policy so that size of cake increases by Individualeffort and merit</comment>

<comment>It is not a question of 'liking' Mamata. There are no easy choices in Indian politics. The BJP is the least acceptable</comment>

<comment>Its communist values like appeasementModi: "development and projects, work on digital india, work for swachh india, startup india...." People: "aaah! We have to work! No free stuff! Damn!"Others: "free free free, reservations...."People: "yes yes yes"</comment>

<comment>yes, you are the only hard working person in India.Baaki sab to khaali aish kar rhe hai!</comment>

<comment>In an extremely diverse country like India, a prime minister should take all sections along. Modi is failing on this basic issue. Also, he has a very autocratic streak. In this he shares a similar trait with many other chief ministers (Jaya, Mamata etc), but when you are the PM, the stakes for the country are much higher.</comment>

<comment>where did modi fail...</comment>

<comment>Oh cm'on, I can't believe you are still asking this question</comment>

<comment>yes...i need to understand.....where did he fail....</comment>

<comment>He doesn't control his ministers making anti-Muslim statements. A PM has to intervene for the good of the country. Did you ever see any Congress minister make any divisive statement during UPA?</comment>

<comment>So as per u his only fault s that he did not control some....that way Akhilesh is also communal...lalu is also communal...and all are including MANMOHAN SINGH...</comment>

<comment>u get the reply look down..</comment>

<comment>you are making it BJP Vs congress...and for your knowledge Manmohan singh had said about first right of minorities on India..was that not divisive and what about HM Shinde saying about Saffron terrorism..</comment>

<comment>First right of minorities is a statement of inclusiveness, it is not divisive at all. I don't know in what context Shinde made his statement, but there is no comparison with the present regime, where intolerant statements are made practically everyday by ministers and MPs</comment>

<comment>It is not inclusive..it is blatant discriminatory statement.</comment>

<comment>You may want to ask yourself that you remember 2 statements from 10 years of UPA. BJP leaders make dozens of divisive statements every month.</comment>

<comment>Jab ek bara per katata hai to aisi ghatnaye hoti rehti hai...- Poor Rajiv gandhi...</comment>

<comment>back to 1984 again?</comment>

<comment>i am giving examples....i want to look forward...and i said poor rajiv gandhi....he was simpler....was cheated by many from his own party...</comment>

<comment>take out One statement of PM....fringe elements are on both side...</comment>

<comment>about Inclusiveness....PM also says he will protect 125 crore Indians...</comment>

<comment>rahul gandhi said to Clinton that he is more concerned about Hindu Terrorists....and numerous example can be taken out...am no record keeper but Congress was nicknamed Khangress is not surprising...</comment>

<comment>I am not a congress supporter. I go by facts. More divisive statements are made by the current BJP government then by the UPA in its entire 10 years.</comment>

<comment>I have in past voted to congress....but they have divided India in the name of religion first and then on the basis of caste...</comment>

<comment>What is BJP doing in your opinion?</comment>

<comment>i don't care for BJP....there are lot of idiots inside and it is essenrially a BANIA party...but Modi is different and i have some hope on him....however the task is cut out...</comment>

<comment>There is a simple English word for it. It's called "cult". You need to be absolutely mindless to be a cult follower.God knows I have more than a fair share of these idiotic morons.</comment>

<comment>But educated Bengalies are not mindless....why they tolerated Left and now Mamata. They all knew that nothing is happening in Bengal but still continued</comment>

<comment>education was destroyed by LEFT now only zombies live there..</comment>
