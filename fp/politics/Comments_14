<comment>How come TV 18 is permitting such rabid anti national propagandist like Sandeepan a platform to spread his propaganda. No one has problem with criticizing govt on real issues like economy and security, but such fictitious rant cannot be termed as news reporting.He only ends up infuriating fence sitters and motivate them to support NaMo. Good for BJP, but bad for journaalism.</comment>

<comment>people call for bharat ki barbadi and Kahmir ki azadi, but somehow all are BJP at fault for acting on them. The question is did BJP organize the event no Left did, did BJP raise the slogan no left did. but BJP is fascist for taking the issue seriously, the thing that happened there was not a joke when the soldiers are dying to protect India against Pakistan here they are raising slogans against India on tax payers money.... But still this is BJP's fault</comment>

<comment>Having political differences is fine. Its just sad to see these so called journalists taking sides so openly and that too at the cost of the nation. I wonder if their hate for BJP runs deeper than their love for India</comment>

<comment>Excerpt "But, the BJP's own record on the parameters it uses to brand others anti-national is blighted. Its brand of nationalism is usually sloganeering and politicking, all sound no substance. It is a sham".As Arun Shourie has correctly stated, the only thing the BJP manages to do is to manage headlines for all the wrong reasons.</comment>

<comment>"All sound no substance" . Wrong, there is a lot of substance. If shouting anti-India slogans in a government institution is 'no substance' then what is?BJP maybe managing headlines right now, but who cares, at least the truth is coming out that there are these sad and pathetic elements in JNU, and in Indian politics. Sounding the FoS argument is nonsense as well since everyone has heard what they want to say.Kannaihya Kumar should be happy with the publicity he is getting, might help him in the next student elections when he becomes around 40.</comment>

<comment>The place does not matter.What action the BJP along with the PDP have taken against "anti-India" and "anti-national" elements, who keep raising Pakistani & ISIS flags, shouting anti-Indian and pro-Pakistani slogans? Nothing - must lost its "courage".</comment>

<comment>1) "Patriotism is always the last refuge of the BJP".The original"Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel" - Samule Johnson,  1775.2) For the RSS/BJP/Modi Sarkaar, bhatks,  fanboys and cheer-girls, anyone who does not agree with them - is anti-Hindu, anti-national, nati-Modi, unpatriotic, a Muslim and should be sent to Pakistan. How juvenile can one be? BJP = Bharatiya Juvenile Party. or Bharatiya Jokers Party (take your pick). </comment>

<comment>Wrong again, its not about people agreeing with the BJP's line of sight, or opposing BJP's line of sight. Its about BJP agreeing with the people's line of sight.If BJP had not taken action, then there would have been a lot of protests against them as well. Bringing hindu and muslim into every debate is not right.</comment>

<comment>1) "its not about people agreeing with the BJP's line of sight, or opposing BJP's line of sight".The problem - the RSS/BJP has only one narrative and will not tolerate any other.2) "If BJP had not taken action, then there would have been a lot of protests against them as well".Are you suggesting that no one should protest against the BJP? Who do you imagine the BJP is? Some divine party. By its heavy handed action, it will pay a heavy price, just Indira Gandhi did in 1970s.</comment>

<comment>Sharam karo Sandipan Sharma. You are supporting Anti-India slogans of the JNU with this article.</comment>

<comment>Vital steps to make Rahul Gandhi prime minister at the earliest.Break Hindu soceity by calling a Rohit Vemula a Dalit and hang him in the Opus Dei fashion.Arrange beef parties in campuses  but never a Pork party.Disturb every positive move of Modi on development.Don't allow Parliament to function to pass bills like GST.Buy fellows like Yechury,Raja,Kejri,Nitish,Owaisi.Organise communal riots.Pay up all media fellows.Wait for further instructions from the Catholic Church.</comment>

<comment>Not a single Blind Bhakth has been able to give an iota of evidence to prove Kanhaiya Kumar was indulging in acts of Sedition..I am waiting................ I am waiting............ I am still waiting.....</comment>

<comment>You will have to wait for eternity.</comment>

<comment>BJP was decimated in Bihar and Delhi So, the BJP has fired its brahmastra. It is expanding all its energy on branding rivals as anti-Hindu and discrediting them as supporters of anti-national elements, terrorists and minorities. Well said Sandipan.</comment>

<comment>Hindu-Muslim divisive Politics Failed in Delhi and Bihar Polls.Amit Shah's new Strategy??? Portraying every rival as a threat to national security, tacit supporter of Pakistan, sympathiser of Kashmiri separatists and being soft towards terrorists and Naxalites are essential components of the BJP's strategy. Arnob Goswami seems to be peddling his Lies very well???</comment>

<comment> Umar khalid shouts anti-India slogans and Police arrest Kanhaiya Kumar???  and BJP and RSS speak of Hindutva. What a bunch of JokersBassi deserves a Bharat Ratna for this kind of Policing?????</comment>

<comment>BJP becomes Patriotic before every election and then after elections Modi Hugs Nawaz Sharief???</comment>

<comment>What kind of blind journalism is this. Mr Sandipan Sharma you can see authentication of your post by counting comments against you. But u will still think you are the only intellect in this discussion. You should be ashamed of yourself. Your parents should ashamed of yourself. Because this country is ashamed of giving shelter to such vermins. Spit on you.</comment>

<comment>BJP itself is a Sham???</comment>

<comment>There are some people in this forum who are vehemently asking what Kanhaiya did and asking why is he being arrested. For once these self claimed intelligent and human rights activists have NOT even a Single time acknowledged the fact that an act of anti-nationalism has been committed! No wonder the law is more stringent towards the king pin rather than the actual perpetrator of the crime. What breeds do these species belong to?</comment>

<comment>Where is the proof???</comment>

<comment>Sandipan: very sorry to say this article of yours is not cutting ice with anyone. Your claims of multiple videos doing the rounds is all A Grade bull c#ap. The clinching video in TOI site is more than enough for someone with common sense and sane mentality. Congress and the Lefts are the bane of this country. What a great Faux pas Nehru committed in J&K. For all those mis management this country has paid a big cost. And now they come right into the heart of this country and do this sh#t. The fact that they are anti-nationals have been proved beyond an iota of doubt. Now what can you guys be classified under trying to support these m0r0ns with your pen?</comment>

<comment>After watching the videos even a dumb can understand author's intentions."BJP MLA beats kanhiya kumar.." ha ha ha ha</comment>

<comment>i think as a Bhakat what BJP is doing is right, every body playing card they played Dalits in Hyderabad and bjp playing anti national in JNU both are ok for political party but not good for country</comment>

<comment>First bhaktard whom I have seen having some intelligence</comment>

<comment>Dear Randipan, BJP has played its cards strategically. After RG royally got into a trap set  up by Yechury, the videos that have now emerged have decisively given BJP the win.</comment>

<comment>I think it is D. Raja (to shield his daughter) dragged everyone into it.Looks like the crooks in media hurt pappu in two ways.1. Not providing this clinching video in advance2. Assuming this case will on same lines as HCUAfter the video is out only argument (rather counter argument) left for opposition is PDP-BJP alliance.</comment>

<comment>Who the crap is this sickular sharma? RG ka right hand hai kya? agar tumhe kaam karna hai tho tumhare boss ki aage hazaar baar pranam karo ya uski charan chuo. lekin is tarah ke articles math likho. Aise articles likhne ke liye Tumhe Sharm hona chahiye Mr. Sharma.</comment>

<comment>LOL. You've never heard of Randipan before? Called "Randi"pan because of his constant pressstitution.</comment>

<comment>Oh he is the great Randipan</comment>

<comment>If in JNU from 2013 prayer for Afzal guru is happening and in that anti India slogans are raised , if this is not anti national then what. That man Afzal guru got fair trail and SUPREME COURT of INDIA had found him guilty. Then the matter should rest there. But INDIA's liberal values are taken for granted and in " JNU BHARAT KI BARBADI TAK JUNG CHALEGI is chanted."  Shame no our sikulars.</comment>

<comment>Asche Din kaha hain.....desperately waiting....</comment>

<comment>Yes i am a Bhakt, a Rashtra Bhakt, BJP bhakt n all. Like all muslims are not Terrorists, not the entire BJP is communal. How come free Kashmir ? Since the thousands years it has been a land of Akhnad Bharat and so it will remain to be. Yes, there is a freedom of expression, so here it is. Kashmir, kerala, Pakistan, Afghainstan, Bangladesh and many more part of world was a part of Great Aryavarta. Give me all .. !!!</comment>

<comment>I believe the majority who know this issue is perceiving it definitely as "anti-national". Anymore defense or diversion by media will only be counter productive.</comment>

<comment>well said</comment>

<comment>I second Anjani. There are some people unfortunately who are so obsessed with getting attention that they will go to any lengths. Sad state of affairs. Gone are the good old days of journalism</comment>

<comment>Tight slap to Rahul Moron Gandhi and his cronies , custody of JNU student leader is extended by 2 days</comment>

<comment> i put comment number 1500</comment>

<comment>Why is that mààdàrçhôd Amit Shah roaming around freely after saying there will be celebrations in Pakistan if BJP loses the elections?</comment>

<comment>mààdàrçhôd is you and your party, do not get emotional when its comes to poltics</comment>

<comment>People here just don't want to use their brains. Every act of standing on the other side cannot be called antinational and the ones doing it Pakistani, Congressi etc.Loving your nation and following the herd and a party are different things!</comment>

<comment>well, many tried to articulate the same about RSS. Proud Hindu does not mean anti-muslim, anti-sikh, anti-christianity.But what we hear over last 60 years?</comment>

<comment>Sir, protesting the beef ban is one thing and I agree with those who did even though I am a vegetarian but protesting against the punishment of Afzal and calling it a killing by SC and saying "Bharat ki barbadi tak" is something that cannot and should not be tolerated and ignored. We have gone overboard with this freedom of speech thing and being too liberal that anybody can take it for granted. How can you allow people back biting India and calling for Kashmir freedom and hailing pakistan?</comment>

<comment>This is 3rd rate journalism. Sandipan Sharma should be in Pakistan if he sympathizes with the parliament bomber.</comment>

<comment>why should he be in Pakistan?  for questioning the rationale of anything?When you start saying someone should be in Pakistan for anything, it shows your mentality. Im pretty sure in future someone will call " If you dont want to kill Muslims, then you should be in pakistan" this is how terrorism begins.</comment>

<comment>You should have an ambidextrous mind to sift the garbage ruckus.  Obvious fixation on ensuring leftist answers to every straightforward issue is the problem of mindsets like yours. When campus students and lecturers like these are bringing in leftist detritus , why won't Indian universities go down international ratings.</comment>

<comment>Probably might have lost some cut after Scamgress went out of power. Showing that grudge.</comment>

<comment>he's anotheR leftist loser</comment>

<comment>I don't know what is wrong with the people who are supporting JNU protest. Someone can have his/her liking to other nations until unless he is loyal to his homeland. Its destruction of the country slogan which is anti-national. Maybe author and his supporters can comfortably see our nation getting destroyed but govt being responsible body took the right decision. It is better to take precaution and avert the danger. JNU students doesn't know the real value of freedom/independence, and how many of them sacrificing their life to keep it safe; if they had knew it they wouldn't have called for fight till destruction of the country.</comment>

<comment>What's the evidence that Kanhaiya raised the slogans? The slogans were most likely raised by students in JNU of Kashmiri origin, yet I don't see any arrests of Kashmiri students - why? To please Mehbooba Mufti and to continue the alliance in Kashmir with PDP, is it?</comment>

<comment>the case is under preliminary investigation. No charges framed yet. Court would have not extended the custody, if not convinced by preliminary evidence.This arrest is same as that of A. Raja, Kanimoli, Dayanidhi maran, jagan etc.</comment>

<comment>So if that's what's wrong...say that (I am talking about the author of this article)....don't say its ok to protest against Afzal's punishment...condemn that...no need to beat around the bush.....and then they can criticize Kanhaiya's arrest and try to prove he innocent and not involved in what happened.</comment>

<comment>Kanhaiah kumar is the one requested for the cultural event to eulogise the mass murderer Afzal at JNU premises. He went ahead with the celebration even after refused by the JNU administration.And look what it has triggered. Global talk again about Kashmir.</comment>

<comment>First he being the organiser knew what would happen on organising event on Afsal death. Second he never objected to anti-national slogan raised in the event immediately. Third as law states being head of the committee he is responsible for not only his actions but also for all the things happen under his watch. Everything is on video and its upto court to decide. You can't justify one crime with another crime.</comment>

<comment>Why aren't Arundhati Roy and Prashant Bhushan arrested for sedition by your logic - assuming he even said that, which I dispute. They have said far more seditious things than anything purported in this case now. Arundhati Roy and Prashant Bhushan have called for plebiscite in Kashmir and are okay with Kashmir going away from India if they so choose. You don't find that objectionable. Why aren't they arrested then? One law for students and one for the high and mighty author and lawyer, is it?</comment>

<comment>Case has been registered against Arundhati Roy. Please read my comment I said slogan like till the destruction of nation which is anti-national. These two cases are different..</comment>

<comment>Asking for Plebiscite is freedom of expression. But1. Calling Supreme court of India a mass murderer2. Destruction of India till their Death3. Breaking India into pieces in the name of Islam (Insha Alla)4. India go Back from JNUThese are seditious charges. If not nipped in the bud, then ISIS activists are already waiting at the door.</comment>

<comment>For your info. Arundhati roy is attending court case in sedition charges,But both are different case, here in JNU go back india, India will be Made into pieces kind of statements are made which are aganist the nation..</comment>

<comment>Calling for plebiscite and shouting slogans for the destruction of a nation are entirely different. .</comment>

<comment>The courts to decide you say - he's already being prosecuted by the lawyers and media. Everyone has already accused him of being anti-national without the case even beginning. How very just? I am sure this is JUSTICE. So if tomorrow he's set free by the courts - as I can 100% say he will be - based on the so-called "evidence" - then who's gonna apologize for that? You? The media? His image is already down in the dumps.</comment>

<comment>How do you know he is honest??. I believe in judiciary,if he is innocent he will released or else he will face the consequences. Also he is responsible for this event,he knew the consequences of hosting cultural event in memories of terrorist Afsal. He never asked government nor he properly informed the JNU administration about this event. Even after denying permission he never stopped it. So why should you blame media or even me for his idiotic act.</comment>

<comment>LOL - are you saying an organiser is logically responsible for everything that happens in an event that is organised? I am sure there's no public event in any part of the world wherein every participant or even the audience would tell you what they're going to say. He has said so himself that he didn't say or support any of the statements made by OTHERS. Now, the question is where are the OTHERS? These "OTHERS" were most likely Kashmiri students, yet NO ONE is talking about them - why? The police could find none of these? Seriously? Are you kidding me?</comment>

<comment>In all your replies you are defending Kanhaiya's arrest......may be he is innocent, may be not...lets leave that to the court...but nowhere in your comments you are condemning anti-India slogans by these JNU guys. Strange.</comment>

<comment>Please know the law, it is the organisers who is responsible for all the events that happens.Because as a organiser any events that occurs is under his permission if someone doesn't compile he has the authorities to stop the mischievous event and inform the higher authorities. In this case he neither stopped the anti-national slogan nor he informed the administration about this immediately. So indirectly it shows that the event has his permission.</comment>

<comment>He is the organizer of the event. He should know what is happening. After organizing the event and it is clearly written in the hand outs given by him.</comment>

<comment>Seven other students are also booked and 20 names are listed in investigation, Policeman are search for other students who made those slogans, Those students are not in the campus at present nor at their home's..</comment>

<comment>If he had made even a single effort to stop this nuisance going on in front of him, i would have supported your view but sorry Shilpa, i am sad what he did. :(JaiAkhandBharat :)</comment>

<comment>Do you know which students raised the slogans?</comment>

<comment>There is a video evidence and all the culprit will face law.</comment>

<comment>Why have no Kashmiri students not been arrested? Seems it's scapegoat time for chaddi bhakts. Pick up ONE person and charge him for sedition when in fact there were tens of Kashmiri students chanting covering their faces with scarves. Yet, the police could find ONE Kanhaiya to make a scapegoat.</comment>

<comment>Chargesheet has been booked against others also. Police is searching for them. My previous reply saying that everything that happens in an event requires organiser permission. So basically first accuse will be organiser.</comment>

<comment>LOL - you mean the video in which nothing can be seen except slogans heard?</comment>

<comment>Shilpa ji. You are crying so much. Hope you were not among those sloganeering? Because arms of justice are long. You will be caught within no time as well if u were present among them. So no use repenting now.</comment>

<comment>Maybe there are other videos. Culprit will face the law that i know.</comment>

<comment>The real culprits will not face any action because they are ABVP goons and the Police under Bassi turns blind when it is about ABVP or RSS or BJP.</comment>

<comment>Only time will tell. Just because u hate ABVP/RSS/Bassi doesn't mean justice will not be delivered. Lets hope all culprits face the law.</comment>

<comment>Toiletpan Sharma at it again. I almost threw up after reading his article. Best to read toiletpan's articles before taking your food.</comment>

<comment>"Retributive justice system" fitted well in the remote past only!Twentieth century paved the way for"Reformative justice"only!The youth of the nation has to be deemed as uncut diamonds,which have to be polished to make the future nation proud of them!" "Lord!Forgive them,they don't know what they do"should be the guideline for the elders and the state for reforming them!</comment>

<comment>I am not sure where your rage is directed at? Isn't it your chaddi govt. in power? Are you unhappy with the performance of the chaddi govt.?</comment>

<comment>LMAO...  when in dock  (  shit in your own chaddi ) ...vomit out 'chaddi' in replies...ROFL</comment>

<comment>Jait-LIE said when in opposition that under chaddis, economy would grow at 8%, rupee would be below 60, and blah this and blah that - well, what happened?</comment>

<comment>Are you going to say global economy is to blame - LOL! You weren't ready to hear that as an argument when in opposition. I guess chaddis are finding out that RULING is more difficult than ELECTIONEERING - LOL!!</comment>

<comment>What - I thought you'd list the performances of the chaddi govt. or is it that there's nothing to crow about  - LOL!!</comment>

<comment>Nah !! thats not going to happen....see your incompetency to prove your point is being vindicated by every comments of your...As i said madarssa-nurtured trolls like you are lurking to jump in whenever in need and start circulating the irrelevant BS...the current issue are jihadisof JNU..why're you shielding them ???</comment>

<comment>I agree with you. Development has become totally irrelevant and any talk about it is bull shit.</comment>

<comment>Why aren't Kashmiri students who raised the slogans not arrested? They were in fact the most to blame and real sympathizers of Afzal Guru, yet no arrest of them - why? Want to save the political alliance with PDP rather than desh bhakti is it? Want to appease Mehbooba Mufti by not arresting them, but just find ONE scapegoat in Kanhaiya, is it?</comment>

<comment>Bwuuuaaah......  Dont even begin on PDP and JK...I've elaborated on that aspect umpteen no. of times on other posts....And you are a madarssa/commie troll , none of the explanation would get across your skull since you're here to run the chicanery and not debate..And those students you referred are absconding...</comment>

<comment>Boo-hoo - LOL. What can you say, NOTHING. It's been an embarrassment for chaddis. To the point that now they're on begging terms with the PDP to get the alliance back on. I suppose so low have they fallen that they can't even arrest Kashmiri students chanting anti-national slogans and can only pick up one scapegoat in Kanaiya. LOL.Btw, why aren't you picking up Prashant Bhushan - he's openly anti-national by your standards. He openly calls for plebiscite in J&K, yet no arrest - why? LOL. None of the JNU students or professors have said that, yet convenient scapegoats for chaddis. Can't fight real terrorists effectively like in Pathankot, but can surely fight campus battles by any means necessary - LOL!</comment>

<comment>Hey madarssa-chaddi....ever heard of AFSPA.... ?? and what it does on the ground....now wipe out that shit lumps out ya' burqa and splash some cold water on your face....and think what i meant.....here they will only go to jail but there ??  something are done surreptitiously..</comment>

<comment>To hell with burqa or beards or virgins - those are none of my passions, as it seems to be yours. LOL. You think what you meant? Here and there? What was that - that's one convoluted post - I guess you should spend some time editing that to make some sense - LOL!!</comment>

<comment>See this is exactly the reason sane minds dont jump out of  their cars and begin arguing with barking dogs across the trash dumps , coz its redundant to make them understand.....Same applies here even the most lucid objectives of AFSPA  are proving to be hard for some trolls to understand....</comment>

<comment>LOL - by what definition or what standards do you quality as SANE. Ah, that made my day - that's the most hilarious statement I ever heard. Oh so you're sane, then who's IN-SANE? LOL. Must be a pretty INSANE word where there are SANES like you - LOL!!</comment>

<comment>bwwuuuah,....when the madarssa-troll's bluff is caught.... Then he is back to the pedantic hair-splitting on words.....see how i crushed you by logic.....A while back you were frothing your trap about actions in JK....but not a word in reply after i made you aware of AFSPA....ROFL</comment>

<comment>Same words, same blabbering, same habit. Wow - you're really beyond rescue aren't you. You're truly loaned your brains at the feet of the GREAT CHADDI - the biggest chaddi of them all. It's understandable for you to go on your robotic inanities.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for confessing there's nothing to list of note. Rest is just copy and paste stuff so I wouldnt' bother to respond - LOL! Who's shielding them? Who is directing the police? Isn't it the chaddi govt.? So what are you saying dear blind chaddi bhakt? It's your police, its your chaddis in power, and yet you accuse others of shielding - LOL!!</comment>

<comment>Keep hallucinating and pretending to be ignorant.... your questions are based on specious enquiry but are meant to work as a diversion....  And i can conclude from whatever absurd views you've on economy , it seems you've read or heard from some half-literate on this issue....coz economy isnt evaluated in vacuum...compare it with previous regime the current will look Gold..You cant fork out basic tenets of macroeconomics then  why would i wast my time on such a crowbain...</comment>

<comment>IT doesn't look gold, It looks Toxic. THe exports, Rupee v/s dollar, Industrial Productivity, GDP (with revised formula), stock market, everything is either static or southwards. The average GDP (with old Formula) over a period of 10 years of previous regime was 7.75% and today it is around 7% with everybody questioning the authenticity of this data.</comment>

<comment>LOL - by using high-sounding words, you don't become knowledgeable - LOL. Try harder. Why not use more fanciful words than these, I might be impressed then dear blind chaddi bhakt.</comment>

<comment>Why would i even think of impressing a bearded madarssa-bear.... You usually post shit ..For you lot ,may be the stinky it gets the more 'intellectual' it becomes .ROFL</comment>

<comment>Perhaps you spend a lot of time in the toilet - so many toilet terms in your posts. Are you constipated or something - LOL!!</comment>

<comment>Says the dweeb whose life revolves around 'chaddi'....  Were you born in a 'chaddi banyian ' store....and the owner kicked you out..ROFL</comment>

<comment>Dweeb - lol - who uses that term? I guess a stupid testosterone driven kid in the midst of adolescence is it - LOL. I don't really think highly of men wearing oversized khaki shorts and doing PT exercises - perhaps you're one of them - LOL!!</comment>

<comment>ROFL..... Dont get so cranky Gafoor... it seems i was right to begin with , indeed you are some puberty riding madarssa controlled fledgeling.....Gettin' all furious on choice of a certain word....LOL</comment>

<comment>Gafoor - what? Ah, at least a change from the usual copy-and-paste terms you usually use. You were right, when - did I miss the part where you were right. Enlighten me what was that part? Oh yes, madrasssa again - ah you can't get beyond the predictable can you. I was just hoping you had expanded your vocabulary - LOL - but chaddi bhakts can't get beyond their limited standard phrases can you. As I said umpteen times before, I ain't a madrassa fan or bearded fan or virgin fan and I ain't no muslim - so i wonder whether you repeat yourself for lack of words or its just a habit at this point. Which one is it?</comment>

<comment>now now Gafoor....i can understand as your layers are being displumed one after another..and your madarssa DNA is out in open....you're feeling chagrined....but dont worry kiddo..you will find some  extremist from AFZAL guru gang  in JNU to glorify you too...</comment>

<comment>Btw - do you know the meaning of agnostic?</comment>

<comment>Meh !!  listen  illiterate Gafooor , i knew that question was coming coz  vacuum of education + lust for islamic  ethos  is a lethal combination for a Brain to function properly...Opposing and resisting  invasion of  Islam doesnt amounts to religious...... I am an agnostic...by birth a a hindu and i dont believe in any religion but for me Hinduism is my identity and civilization.....Other than this subject of islamic +Misisoanry cancer i'm more liberal than any liberal out there...</comment>

<comment>LOL - I only asked because these days chaddi bhakts don't tolerate agnostics in their midst. But you seem to be freelancing for chaddi bhakts, so good luck with that.</comment>

<comment>ROFLMAO... who told you that ??There is a world out of your madarssa dungeon...try to take  a peak into the real world from time to time and dont blindly believe what your handlers teach you...You are full of delusion....pls arrange a visit to nearest shrink...</comment>

<comment>Can you be a Republican without subscribing to the Christian faith? I am sure you're an a freelancing bhakt to be an agnostic and yet claim to be a chaddi bhakt. Of course, you can post here and be an online bhakt, but you sure can't be a minister in the chaddi cabinet if you openly say so that you're an agnostic for sure. You wouldn't get the blessings of the half chaddis sitting in Nagpur if you do that!!</comment>

<comment>Also, tell them there is no need to build Ram mandir in Ayodhya. You're saying that you can make fun of chaddi beliefs and be welcome into the chaddi shaka - LOL!!</comment>

<comment>LOL - why don't you go to chaddi shaka and tell them that you think there is no God.</comment>

<comment>LOL - is there a test to prove that I ain't Muslim. If so - let me know. Or that doesn't matter to you - LOL. Who's supporting Afzal - NOT me. Who's supporting anti-nationals - NOT me. Which post did I post wherein I supported anti-nationals or Afzal, tell me? Go on - read all my posts and come back if you can - LOL!!</comment>

<comment>Arrey dear.... look you would be also knowing that after public expose how those Left wing nutjobs  are trying their best to distance from the sloganeering they did in favour of Pakistan..and swearing to cut India into pieces  , due to the public backclash.....But that doesnt means they dont believe in that mindset...  Similarliy you're doing teh same thing....You maybe or maybe not  a born Muslim but behaving as one of their pawns...</comment>

<comment>LOL - are you going to do door-to-door questionnaires for identifying "Mindsets" now? LOL - I just told you in another post there are people like Arundhati Roy and Prashant Bhushan who openly say anti-India things and openly call for freedom for Kashmir - Kanhaiya has not said so. Why don't you arrest Arundhati and Prashant Bhushan? Why is Kanhaiya the target? Because he's a student - not some big shot author or lawyer, is it?</comment>

<comment>Did they explicitly said that till their last breath they will work to divide India into pieces and Afzal was not a terrorist.....  yeah they did said far more worse things  in shrewd covering of articulation  , which  technically was very hard to be proven sedition in the court  but was BJP in power  then ....??</comment>

<comment>LOL - I just said both of these - Arundhati Roy and Prashant Bhushan have been saying far worse things than that, including saying Kashmiris should be given the right to decide their future and break away from India if they so choose. So why aren't they arrested? What has Kanhaiya done? What's the evidence where he can be heard speaking anti-national things? These individuals, Arundhati Roy and Prashant Bhushan have been proudly saying these for years in the media and yet no action against them, why? Because they can have access to lawyers and expose the limits of the SEDITION law, is it? I'm telling you Kanhaiya will be released 100% because there is nothing to say that he said what he's accused to have said. Plus, others have said far more worse things and chaddi govt. isn't arresting them. So there's double standards here that's evident for all to see. If they are really against anti-nationals, then arrest Arundhati Roy and Prashant Bhushan first.</comment>

<comment>LOL - once again, assumptions when all else fails. I couldn't care two hoots about madrasses or anyone of the bearded dispensation. You can cry hoarse about using your standard copy and paste terms, makes no effect on me. LOL!!</comment>

<comment>It is the truth.  i am just pointing out the fact that people for whom Muslims vote are the people who use and throw them. In fact all Delhi muslims voted AAP. What is the representation of Muslims in Delhi government</comment>

<comment>teri maa ki choot me ungli daal ke dekh</comment>

<comment>PDP should also be charged with sedition for supporting Afzal ...Does bjp has guts or nuts???Why did you ally with it???</comment>

<comment>Hijra Modi doesn't have the balls to do it.</comment>

<comment>Do you have any real idea about Kashmir's actual situation? Or are your knowledge also half literate like most of your fellow pseudo-leftists/liberals. BJP has been brought into government because it won the majority in the Jammu and Ladakh regions, PDP won in valley. To form a government both need to form an alliance as you need 44 seats in assembly to claim majority. That is why the alliance happened. And sedition in valley is being tackeled in its own way. No two situations are alike. WHat happened in Delhi can not be compared to Kashmir situation. Please at least educate your self on facts before posting ridiculous arguments.</comment>

<comment>You hold the absolute right and monopoly to wisdom ... Right ???</comment>

<comment>Wrong. I base my arguments on FACTS, real facts. And not on some cooked up stories.</comment>

<comment>Oh yes, FACTS - according to the chaddi school of knowledge, right - LOL!!</comment>

<comment>And I base my arguments on principles... Which our nationalist party is so boastful of before each election and campaign season ... And gleefully forget it after it ...Cooked up stories ... Lol ... That's why I term the bhakts and bhaktins as severely afflicted with the bhakti virus ... Hopefully ZICA won't reach that proportions ...</comment>

<comment>See your comment has no relevance to my argument. It is like I asked you "Please exlain how the universe came into being on the basis of the thoery of modern science" and in your answer you talk about the "biography of Narendra Modi". lol. What has principles got to do with your original question on BJP-PDP alliance and my counter argument to yours? Haha, this is not some examination where you will get marks for writing songs in response to academic uestions. At least have some back up with facts and truth before claiming to debate.</comment>

<comment>Err - what? "Theory of modern science?" LOL!! What has the current Chaddi Govt. in alliance with the PDP done for Kashmiri pandits? Pray tell me? What exactly? And what have the chaddis done to the seditious Kashmiris who raised Pakistani flags and chanted anti-India slogans, tell me? It's far easier isn't it to pick up ONE Kanaiya Kumar and charge him with sedition based on a grainy video shot by an ABVP bhakt. How very wonderful!!</comment>

<comment>I think you are an idiot beyond doubt. Even though I gave you such logical explainations in our past discussion, you simply continue with your ignorant self. And onviously you do not understand logic. Continue with whatever joblessness you are in, may you have a true purpose to your life soon. What a waste you guys are.  Your parents must be super proud of you. Twats.</comment>

<comment>Are you a m0r0n?</comment>

<comment>You mean like aam aadmi</comment>

<comment>Are you really that dumb??? Can't believe ...The Baap- beti were a bête noire before elections ...Should have gone for re elections if your own words & principles matters to you ...Lol .. Lust for power couldn't be coated with illogical blabberings... </comment>

<comment>Wow. These are not illogical blabbering but the logical facts to the situation. I don't know maybe it is way took logical and rational for you to understand. My job was to present the actual situation. You can continue with your ignorance and not be bothered with the truth. That is your loss and choice. Cheers.</comment>

<comment>See, I'm not on any paid job to defend any of the political outfits ...They will get my boot or bet will depend on how they behave before and after elections ...And most importantly ... Principles and promises matter ...You may be allured with riches and power at all costs ... So enjoy your share ...Not everyone ... So that's my logic ...3 cheers ...</comment>

<comment>I wanted to reply her, even promised but decided to ignore such biased mind with no logical thinking what so ever.</comment>

<comment>if they align with you will you guarantee them a share in power?</comment>

<comment>Who will align with me?I refuse to align with either bjp or pdp ... Both are sub standards ...</comment>

<comment>why are you so cruel?</comment>

<comment>Lol ...I'm loving it ...</comment>

<comment>thery love you so much and actually want a PDA with you.</comment>

<comment>I choose my lovers ... They are welcome to dream about me though ...</comment>

<comment>you are forgiving anti national bhakts?</comment>

<comment>Anti national activities cannot be allowed to flourish on campuses , period</comment>

<comment>Delhi Police entering JNU campus is an anti-national activity. Màadarch0d Bassi and màadarch0d Rajnath should be hanged immediately</comment>

<comment>irrespective of who does it.</comment>

<comment>Just imagine if Kanhayia was a Dalit..Then the entire media and sickular gang would have gone berserk....</comment>

<comment>Students at their age are usually idealists. So the idea of a world of equality appeals to them and that is the way Commies ensnare them. Finally it leads to shouting anti-India and pro-terrorist slogans.Who is to blame? The Commie parties like CPI, CPM and sickulars like Congress. They are the real culprits</comment>

<comment>India’s Right and India’s Left – And all the tumult thine maketh !So, apparently some outlandish comments were made inside one of India’s most prestigious universities – JNU. In fact a group of students organized a death anniversary of a separatist leader of Kashmir and shouted pro Kashmir statements and anti India comments. Well, so apparently it was considered sedition. But again it can be argued that freedom of speech in India is absolute – and if shouting anti India comments is a crime then numerous denizens of Kashmir and North East India should be behind bars right now. The comments made inside JNU sounds utterly childish, obnoxious and insane even. But the blabbering of a mad man should not frighten a great nation. Should it? The entire issue has now become a political one with the left and right fighting for space. Well, to stat with I believe that the comments made in JNU against the Indian state are obscene, sad and highly disgusting. However, being pro Kashmir or pro azadi is not a crime. Dissent against the Indian state is not a crime as long as it is non violent.  I have not read the exact law to that effect – but growing up in independent India gives me the impression that we have the kind of freedom which should be the envy of many countries. Our freedom is not partial or in moderation but absolute. Well, from a leftist perspective that makes sense and hence the great commotion over the JNU issue does raise some eye brows.However, if freedom of speech is indeed absolute in India – why is it that right wing comments are considered outrageous. Whenever some right wing elements give hate speech we frown upon them and never bring freedom of speech in the discourse? In the “intellectual” (sic) media space any right wing comment or the perpetrators of such crime is crucified, but when similar left wing comment is made we immediately talk about freedom of speech.The fact is neither the right nor the left makes sane or rational sense. Most often they come up with nonsensical statements. However, we have not heard about any action being taken against the right wing haters – why the brouhaha against a left wing statement? That makes the ‘left’ the victim in a right wing government. It only fuels the fantasy of the ‘revolution’ which left wingers are so very fond of. It gives the left a valid enemy – as left ideology is almost always anti establishment. That adds to the perception of a monstrous right wing Government and the victim left. The Modi government should not have got involved in this issue and unnecessarily added to its perception woes.</comment>

<comment>If India were to soft pedal the issue, in deference  to the wishes of free speech advocates, terrorism will rule the roost because India is an under developed or developing country. France being a developed country may have the luxury of unfettered freedom despite terrorism. Here the terrorists and traitors attack parliament, Bombay city, Air bases with impunity. And you advise leniency. And the country is not ready fir it.</comment>

<comment>When mad men blabber they are taken to psychologist right. No one is afraid but anti nationals can't have a free run on campuses of Colleges..</comment>

<comment>with in a space of one month or so issue of anti nationalism raised at both HCU andJNU. thogh one was also coloured with dalit issue. for other it is still to be seen.</comment>

<comment>The facts are so twisted to encash electoral gains ...Jnu guys themselves have distanced from the anti national sloganeering ...Why not catch the culprits than branding the whole institution ... Just bcas its hard nut to crack ideologically ... Destroy it ??? I see ...</comment>

<comment>Video footage and eye witnesses are there. One can't get away with bluffing.</comment>

<comment>So prosecute the criminals ...Someone committed a crime in your colony while you were there looking ... That means your are a criminal ... Great logic ... Salute your grey matters ...</comment>

<comment>Here comes another PORKI extremist....what electoral gains you jihadi pest ???....    JNU guys have distanced from such act ....so did Yakub and Afzal from any kind of terrorist activity... You think that people are naive to fell for your veiled support for the terrorists..Left ideology in itself is based on division of INDIA And expansion of Islam..</comment>

<comment>Get lost you idiot pig ... Don't use something that you don't have ... That is brain ...The shell will burst open whatever little gobble and vomit outlet it houses ... </comment>

<comment>What the heck was that.....Offcourse to brainwashed  madarssa extemists my words would appear offensive..... similar to snakes crawling hurriedly across the street when sensing a rampaging truck towards them...</comment>

<comment>Shoo ...this filthy nut has to be avoided ... Terminally Afflicted with highly contagious infection that makes people logically dead ... Then they start dancing on Madarasa and Shakha music ... The whole idea is to divide and rule ... The lesson learnt from british masters ... Whom they sided when entire india was fighting for freedom ... The killers of gandhi are now new nationalists ... Wasn't there any sedition law then btw???And sleeping with pdp in Kashmir  who openly support Afzal is another criteria for being the greatest nationalist ... Lol lol lol ..</comment>

<comment>Illiterate madarssa runt , from whatever i could conclude from the absolute horrific madarssa-taught English you splattered ....Which  freedom fight you're referring to ??  The one in which Hindus were pushed to dark by the Congress , Commies and Gandhi....and more than half of the land was surrendered to Islam....Why  you terrorists  are so incorrigibly shameless , that in the heat of defending JNU jihadis you will begin distorting the entire history....LOL</comment>

<comment>Read my other comments carefully before making any idiotic comments ...And btw ... History is being distorted by the chaddi scums ... One question on hindu history ... And u will pee in your chaddi a55h0le ...</comment>

<comment>so you are CRK D who was bashed so many times that you ran away.</comment>

<comment>in matters related to pak, we indians r habitual appeasers.</comment>

<comment>who told you so. LBS, IG WERE SO? SIMPLY ACCEPT THESE COWARDS ARE.</comment>

<comment>You mean, even the 56-inch Indian?</comment>

<comment>absolutely</comment>

<comment>What do you expect...  a full throttle war on PAK...so that India gets strangulated out by the World and we are thrown into a state of ruination...</comment>

<comment>did it happen during Kargil war? cowards always are afraid of even of their own shadows.</comment>

<comment>Hey  clueless  retard...stay away... you pAAP zombies are bigger threat to the country than PAK itself...</comment>

<comment>hypocrite when you are answerless, clueless and every body becomes threat to the country which you people are.</comment>

<comment>See i dont want to dignify your moronic trash-talk with any response.....An imbecile who dont understands the war , the reason behind it and the impact it has on a country dont deserves a serious reply...Madarssa zombie , do you know what lead to Kargil war ...??</comment>

<comment>despite all its shortcomings and blemishes , AAP is the only becon of hope for the country.</comment>

<comment>Kashmir also have AFSPA imposed to take care of traitors. Should we do the same in JNU?</comment>

<comment>let us face the truth both these commies and bhakts are anti nationals. but these commies are a vanishing tribe with vety limited presence. these bhakts are spreading their dens across the country and sucking it like an amar bel.</comment>

<comment>west bengal has been the biggest sufferer of communism and this has spread to the country.</comment>

<comment>but the seed of anti nationalism there is not sown by commies but these communal bigots.</comment>

<comment>communal bigots r rare in bengal. its all a muslim land.</comment>

<comment>can muslims also not be communal bigots?</comment>

<comment>nah. they r seculars. our didi has made us learn this fact.</comment>

<comment>then why are you lamenting?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>but  cant support anti national jnu scums.</comment>

<comment>same here. supporting aap does not equate to supporting anti nation vermin at NHU.</comment>

<comment>hehehe. anyways i wear a Chaddi inside :)actually every human being wears a Chaddi inside.</comment>

<comment>So under those Abayas and Burqas, there are chaddis also?But isnt that an obstruction to quick activities?</comment>

<comment>LOL. ur naughty .</comment>

<comment>Seriously. The whole purpose of Abaya/ Burqa is gone if they start wearing chaddis also</comment>

<comment>indian commies only know washing chinese chaddis and supporting anti national elements.</comment>

<comment>Fundoo comment...But very true alsoCommies attract students with the utopia of equality and prosperity for everyone.But finally this leads to supporting Pakis and anti-nationals</comment>

<comment>In the Kashmir valley, every day there are slogans for "Azadi" even from your own PDP allies. How many have you arrested for sedition? is there a different law on JNU grounds? Or is Kashmir's soil not Indian soil?</comment>

<comment>Btw ... Bjps partner in J&K supports Afzal ... Hope they are charged with sedition as well ... Will bjp walk the talk ??? Or hunger for power will show the ugly double face ???</comment>

<comment>bjp is shameless power hungry party.</comment>

<comment>I don't think all who support it are equally shameless ...Either ... They would hopefully bring it on track or desert it ... That is ... The self respecting ones ... </comment>

<comment>true</comment>

<comment>shh. please do not raise such issues. otherwise like me you will also be declared an anti national.</comment>

<comment>Lol ...I don't mind mentally consumed creatures ranting and panting ...Above party lines ... The truth is truth ...If they can kill gandhi ... We are just worms ... But truth needs to be said and understood ... I'm sure we are not dumb and do realise it ... Although the respective bhakti keeps us from speaking out ...</comment>

<comment>pseudo-nationals declaring you "anti-national", makes you "pseudo-anti-national"!</comment>

<comment>the so called commies had sided with the chinese against the indian govt in 1962. actually indian commies r just fake ones.</comment>

<comment>pitty, they were not sent to jail then.</comment>

<comment>true. nehru should have sent them to jail.</comment>

<comment>Before Hindus used to just bend down and get raped/Killed/Massacred/Kicked out of Kashmir etc etcNow that we have found our voice and demand justice, the PIGS are getting hurt.Your pain is the proof that Modi and BJP are doing the work we have elected them for.So, yeah - keep feeling the pain bittches :)</comment>

<comment>Copy and paste bhakt in auto-bhakti mode. LOL - copying and pasting all over the place - LOL!!</comment>

<comment>And you the copy paste Kambhakt.</comment>

<comment>LOLYeah..LOL.That's why u guys are soooo hurt and crying all over the country ;)</comment>

<comment>true communists love the country, like che guevara, bhagat, bose, etc. but fake commies have become apologists of terrorists, islamists in the garb of communism.</comment>

<comment>and please define these communal bigots also. can you equate them?</comment>

<comment>both r danger to the country.</comment>

<comment>these bigots will vanish once these apologists vanish.</comment>

<comment>and why do you think , we like them? they are gutter snipes too, like JNU vermin.</comment>
