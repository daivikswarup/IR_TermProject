<comment>What is this author talking about, BJP won many elections after delhi.Also it is clear why ak withdrew his support, because he knew his side would lose.</comment>

<comment>ANTI-INDIAN FORCES, ARE HELL-BENT TO DERAIL THE DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH WHICH IS TAKING PLACE UNDER THE NDA REGIME.  NATIONALISTS IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULDN'T LET THEIR GUARD OF AND JUMP WITH VIGOUR AND PASSION TO CAMPAIGN FOR NATIONALIST NDA IN UPCOMING BIHAR ELECTIONS. ITALIAN MAFIA STOOGES,  NEO-NAXALITE THUGS AND CORRUPT POLITICIANS HAVE JOINED HANDS TO DERAIL INDIA'S DEVELOPMENT. THEY ARE BEING HELPED IN THIS REGARD BY PSEUDO-SECULARIST, MARXIST, FAKE-LIBERAL MEDIA. DURKHA BUTT AND HER ILK ARE HELL BENT TO DEFEAT THE NATIONALIST NDA AND SATISFY THEIR FOREIGN MASTERS. NATIONALISTS AND PATRIOTS IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD TAKE UP THIS HOLY MISSION OF CAMPAIGNING FOR NDA.</comment>

<comment>IT'S IMPERATIVE FOR PEOPLE OF BIHAR TO VOTE FOR NDA, TO PROMOTE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE.</comment>

<comment>Change in Bihar is very important for its development.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>The beauty of democracy is that it allows change, in political leadership peacefully. This change is the primary reason why democratic countries develop faster than communist counries, kingdoms or dictators. In Communist countries or Kingdoms the political & administration is stagnant and so is the development & growth.Bihar has seen Lallu, Rabdi, Nitish & Manjhi. Now the change is for BJP.BJP has always supported smaller states for the purpose of efficiency in administration and development. We remember that BJP were the first supporters of Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh etc. When time is ripe we will get Gorkhaland, have no doubt it. Even this day the autonomous body manages Gorkhaland area, except the Duars.</comment>

<comment>agreed with that,   and in the scenario  bjp losses =voting on basis of religion/castte=means serious implications for  the economic  progress  of countryit will mean growth development  ,education ,health care are less important  than caste /religionthis country  will go a decade  back if casteist opportunist crooks  managed to win</comment>

<comment>Some opportunistic parties are joining hands to deny the people of Bihar a good governance and development model that BJP would provide. Hopefully the people will see through the opportunistic & unnatural alliance of Nitish - Lallu.</comment>

<comment>either people will make a choice for development  or iff pseudo secular-corrupt parties win blv me it will significantly dampen the investment climate in whole country and slowing economy will slow further ....</comment>

<comment>Good point. And now Russia is joining as well, while the US leaves. Which means US agrees, but behind the seen. It cannot admit it in public.</comment>

<comment>Opposition are trying their level best to polarise the issue but hoping people will not fall to these petty politics made by all the opposition parties and make BJP get simple majority for development of Bihar </comment>

<comment>All killing is wrong. BJP is all set to win Bihar elections. Let us not mix issues.</comment>

<comment>Indians want to fight. Even if you eradicate religion, caste, class and creed, still people will fight over issues like Salman Vs. Shahrukh, Mahesh Vs. Pawankalyan, Vijay vs. Ajith. They simply want no development.</comment>

<comment>You can't apply Periyar's philosophy to the whole of India. Most of the caste wars in Tamil Nadu have nothing to do with the so called Aryans.</comment>

<comment>How are the Threads not related to the caste wars? They are the ones to create the caste for their convenience.Brahmins are the root cause for all kind of caste wards in this country.</comment>

<comment>when ISIS kills people..u say terrorists have no religionbut when a muslim person is killed then u say hindus are terrorist..please justify this hypocrisy...else stop spreading this communal venom..please</comment>

<comment>So the Dadri killers deserve the same treatment as the ones treated by the sickulars as having no religion, right?Fine, then please hang them like Kasab. Happy now?</comment>

<comment>see... u cannot have different parameters to judge killing...killing one person or many..is not at all acceptable..shud be hanged to death..so next time one ll think 10 times before killing somebody..  that's y in china no communal tension</comment>

<comment>so you mean that people found accused of murder in Dadri should be treated as terrorist and hanged accordingly...</comment>

<comment>How did you manage to tweak the FP's spam guards?</comment>

<comment>The killing at Dadri is most condemnable. But now the news is emerging that the mob got enraged not for eating the beef for killing the calf. Even  then the killing is not justifiable.  But tell me honestly, if a Hindu makes a cartoon of the Prophet which would definitely enrage muslim mob and that person may get killed also. In such a scenario, whether the Media will condemn that with the same vehemance and whether a bee-line  of netas would be visiting the victims family?</comment>

<comment>if BJP LOSES ,biharis are doomed , will remain an island of misery in land of prosperity to come</comment>

<comment>Yes Then BJP/Modi will spew their Venom on Bihar also...Like Delhi</comment>

<comment>PM should condemn the Dadri violence to provide good governance . he should break his silence on crucial issues</comment>

<comment>so you mean PM should comment  on every murder which happens in the country ?</comment>

<comment>It is not every murder. It was pre-planned, pre-meditated murder by BJP-RSS goons on the instructions of senior BJP-RSS leaders including Modi. RSS-BJP goons are now behaving exactly like Hitler's SS.</comment>

<comment>Instead of killing the dadri man...the mob should have killed u...at least one porkistani would have reduced</comment>

<comment>Nobody is saying that the murder was required. But the comments made by some people are pathetic.  The person who was killed actually stole the cow and calf from a hindu family, by the time people got to know about this, that man had killed the calf. When people went to his house, there are remains of the calf flesh. Angry mob trashed him to death. This is what happened in dadri. Now what should the news read ? it should read, " A thief who stole the cow and calf was beaten to death by angry mob". But what did the media and pesudo seculars show " man was killed because he ate beef ". Mean while a man in the mob was shot by the one of the family members of that family, why is that nobody wants to speak about that person, and how did that person in the muslim family had a gun at home ??</comment>

<comment>Now media has turned into 4th pillar of destruction...... The other three r congress, AAP and third front</comment>

<comment>Secular gun, from ISIS.</comment>

<comment>its very unfair to term any death as per-planned.. in a country like india every daya here or there 10 murders are happening by stats.. do y think all are planned... just because media highlighted doesn't mean u make it a communal issue ...this is a state affair...UP's law and order situation is UP state govt.. police,IG everybody fall under state umbrella..U need to understand india's complex political structure a bit more before spreading communal hatred here.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>see... I can understand ur agony..but u need to understand.. if somebody comes to ur home and kills ur daughter that doesn't mean that person is only guilty..How come ur enemy can enter into ur house...?So either u allowed him to kill ur daughter or u and ur enemy both planned to kill..think abt this once... think logically... just dnt be blind on these prestitutes</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>first of all communal harmony is more about state affairs ...because the people,land,police belongs to state not center..I seems to have little knowledge abt indian federal structure..please read some books</comment>

<comment>If BJP does not rule India now, then Porkistani Pig agents like Owaisi, Lalu, Sonia, and Nitish will promote ISIS to destroy both Hindus and muslims...</comment>

<comment>ur lucky that ur state has a negligible muslim population</comment>

<comment>sorry bro.. it has nothing to do with population of one community..its about the state govt and law order situation of state ... and more over more people are educated and employed less communal tension and crimes..so the best solution is engage every youth in Job,provide employement, development for all..</comment>

<comment>odisha has negligible muslim population</comment>

<comment>as I said population has nothing to do with harmony...in Malaysia majority is islam,minority is Buddhist and hindu..still look at the law order situation there..its all abt people and education...also the role of state govt</comment>

<comment>By Dailit CM candidate, BJP means it will put either Manjhi or Paswan as CMs if they win. Simple question - do people of Bihar want either of them as CMs? Vote accordingly.</comment>

<comment>As per confidential source, Articulate and smart Ravi Shankar Prasad or Rajiv Pratap Rudy who are both very loyal to Modi having enough ministerial experiences are expected to be next CM in consultation with Legislator to bring all oversees Industries under Make in India mission to convert it to modern Bihar quickly like ancient India when highest intelligent persons of India used to leave in Bihar only. Sushil Modi having good education will be taken to Union Govt.  Stylish Chiraj Paswan might be considered as Dy CM of Bihar. </comment>

<comment>Though a big fan of PM Modi myself, let me remind PM Modi that Bihar is not Gujarat. Bihari people are of completely different constitution.-Bihari people value “Bihari Pride” more than anything else. PM Modi has hurt this pride by abusing Bihari DNA-Bihari people are knowledge driven and not money driven. You will rarely find a Bihari person trying to earn money through shortcuts like stock market. Bihari people believe in working hard and sleeping well. -Bihari students form the largest chunk in IITs, IIMs, Civil Services, Railways, Banking exams. Gujarati students form the smallest chunk.-25% of IT Industry workforce is from Bihar compared to 1.3% from Gujarat. Bhojpuri is widely spoken and understood on the streets of IT hubs like Bangalore, Chennai, Pune.It is very hard to predict what is their inside the minds of Bihari voters because these people think very differently.</comment>

<comment>Kindly watch Modi's speech again, Modi said Nitish Ji's political DNA is defective which is admitted by entire political leaders. Now Nitish has studied in Madrasa wherein he was not taught the meaning of DNA and he is matching his DNA with entire Biharis DNA. How can one DNA is same with others. In fact Nitish became a loughing stock for his DNA jibe. </comment>

<comment>Export of beef(meat of cow, oxen & calf) is prohibited as per GoI's Meat Export Policy. Beef is not permitted to be exported. Bone in meat,caracas of buffalo(both male&female) is also prohibited & not permitted to be exported. Only boneless meat of buffalo, male& female(NOT beef) & meat of goat & sheep is permitted to be exported, subject to provisions specified in Gazette Notifications on raw meat... As per the distribution of legislative powers between Union of India& states, preservation of cattle is the matter on which the state legislatures have the exclusive powers to legislate. As per the GoI's Foreign Trade Policy each consignment is compulsorily required to be accompanied by a certificate from the competent authority certifying that meat has been derived from buffaloes unfit for mulching and breeding. It is also mandatory for exporters to subject meat and meat products to anti-morgen and post-morgen examinations. Exporters would be required to certify that the raw material have been sourced exclusively from APEDA registered integrated. abattoir or APEDA registered meat processing plant. Preservation of cattle or enacting law on cow slaughter does not fall under the purview of the Central Government.Courtesy :Nirmala Sitharaman</comment>

<comment>The Gujarat poll panel postponed the local body elections soon after the state government promulgated an ordinance to put off the process, citing apprehension that voters would not be “allowed to vote freely and fairly” — a move largely seen as provoked by the ongoing Patidar agitation for quota.</comment>

<comment>BJP is sure if election will held today in Gujarat BJP will not win so BJP has decided to postponed municipality election for next year  </comment>

<comment>Modi Sir, please do not ban porn. You have stopped Congress, Lalu, Sickulars and Owaisi from fcking India, so now they need an outlet to express these tendencies. Porn is harmless activity for them unless they engage in rape. Then put them in jail for 50 years minimum</comment>

<comment>Whatever bak-bak bhakts do here, fact is that all porn-watching MLAs, caught red-handed inside the house, belong to BJP/RSS only ...</comment>

<comment>ur talking as if u never watched porn :))))</comment>

<comment>But, unlike these cheats and hippocrates I never claimed to be a 'puritarian' or 'sanskari' and demanded any ban. And I eat beef (and pork) too.</comment>

<comment>Maratha hoke porn like krta h tu? Modi also likes? Snoopy dog!</comment>

<comment>rofl.....men will be men!</comment>

<comment>Porn is not banned , even i am a BJP supporter and i shag a lot along with my gf watching porn, so it cannot be banned. Everyone loves porn</comment>

<comment>haha....</comment>

<comment>Why NDA wins Bihar hands downAdvent of Grand Un-AllianceIf ever there was a term to be invented as the antonym of alliance in electoralpolitics, now is the time as anti BJP forces have coalesced together in ahuddle called maha-gathbandhan (Grand Alliance –GA) in Bihar. Normally,alliance means where the voters swearing allegiance to one party vote for anotherparty in the same alliance when their own party is not in the fray in theirconstituency. This way the votes of the various parties get added up against acommon rival and the help the alliance partners win the battle against thestronger parties/alliances. Had it not been for the stitching or unstitching ofthe alliances, the political history would have been totally different in India.These alliances add the votes not just arithmetically but the euphoria providedby the coming together of different interest groups creates the rightenvironment to woo the other neutral interest groups as well.Coming to Bihar, it is a clear case of un-alliance. The negatives of the alliance partners add uprather than the positive ones. Nitish has allied with Lalu in the belief that itwill bring his formidable Muslim-Yadav (M-Y) vote bank along with him. Lalupossibly thinks that this (M-Y), along with Nitish's track record of goodgovernance, will give him a comfortable majority in certain constituencies.  However, the reverse seems to be true.Imagine the options before a RJD’s core voter base, Yadav in theconstituency where RJD candidate is not contesting because the seat has gone toits partner JD-U or Congress. This voter knows that come what may his preferredleader cannot be CM, his party candidate cannot be MLA as he is not contesting,thus, his voting for alliance helps the very party (JD-U) whom he has wanted todethrone all through. Also, the rival candidate is not hostile but is the onewho is wooing him (yaduvanshi) vigorously all through and whom he is not averseto. So, who should his close second preference candidate be?  It has to be NDA?  Add to this, the large section of post mandalyadav youth who is not that enamored of its chieftain Lalu, the chemistry of thisGrand Alliance not just nullifies but exacerbates its arithmetic in the sense,that in the case of no alliance, a larger slice of this vote would have gone toRJD, not to the rival NDASimilarly, the options before JD-U voters. Who is JD-U voter?  Kurmi, Muslims, EBC, Mahadalit, Goodgovernance appreciating ones. The last one it loses easily to its rival BJPpresenting it on a platter. Even if one appreciates the good governance (andriddance from Lalu’s Jungle Raj) by Nitish Babu and looks at him positively,does its present positioning with the very proponents of that Jungle Raj andagainst the ones (BJP) what was its backbone in that transition from Jungle Rajto Su-shasan, makes it the good alternative, especially when BJP / NDA is thein-thing and is perceived to be associated with development plank. BJP’s ticketdistribution (in the spirit of its recognition of Bihar as Mandal Pradeshunlike the Kamandal “Uttar Pradesh”) and its alliance with HAM, LJP and RLSP offerthe easy transition of EBC, Mahadalit to NDA camp. It facilitates it furtherwhen it is seen as the emerging victor. Who does not like to join the winningbandwagon unless it is chronically antagonistic (as is Muslim interest group)or extremely loyal to another party (Kurmi to a certain extent).Congress: Thinking of its situation here, I am reminded of a funnysituation in 2014 Lok Sabha elections where a congress candidate from a westernUP seat, (perhaps Noida/ Gautam Budh Nagar) quit the congress and joined BJPafter the last date of withdrawal of name from the polls was over, thus askingthe voters to vote against himself. That should have been the point of deepintrospection in the grand old party. But then, every human being, every party,every organization, every kingdom, every civilization has its own life cycle.It is true that the Congress tried to inflict damage on its rival bysending Rahul Gandhi into exile but it seems to be too little too late toreverse something that has become inevitable.Add to this, a few more facts.(a) Attempt toneutralize certain anti NDA votes through third front, AIMIM etc(b) No love lostbetween the G-A partners and conflicting interest. Lalu’s interest lies more infinishing off Nitish and ensuring a better future for his family (which comesjust by doing better than JD-U rather than defeating BJP) that Nitish’scoronation as CM.(c) The fact thatboth NDA and Lalu gain by defeating Nitish Kumar and finishing JD-U as a partymakes easier for NDA(d) BJP’s,especially Amit Shah’s stupendous success in managing elections at the boothlevel as in  UP (73/80) in 2014.So, on Nov 8, 2015, NDA victory in more than 200 seats should not comeas a surprise. The surprise will be its win in less than 150 seats. The realloser will be Nitish and his main tormentor will be Lalu rather than Modi. Laluwill be quite happy in occupying the secular space and emerging as the messiahof Muslims and finishing off Nitish forever. Nitish is likely to fall flatbetween two stools of Casteism and Development and will fail to get the seatsin double digit. His aligning with Lalu will be his undoing and presenting thedevelopment constituency on a platter to the NDA. Not to say, that by not doingso he would have won another term but he would have kept his credibility intactand occupied the opposition space which could have helped him in future. Forthe NDA, the counting starts from 40 (the number of the seats allocated tocongress)So, some prediction about this election and its aftermath(a) There is noclose contest as we often try to project. NDA is likely to get 140-220 seats (thebroad band will get narrower with each passing day). This is the informationage and the time of instant media (electronic and social) and there is a lot ofdependence of voting tendencies unlike the past where voters voted inisolation. Thus, floating votes get added to the winning bandwagon easilyand  wave/tsunami gets created. However,we have been so tuned/ conditioned to thinking on the usual lines that wereject overwhelming figures instinctively.(b) JD-U reducedto a single digit. Nitish Kumar will gain the sympathy post election replacingChandra Babu Naidu in Indian political history as the paradoxical figure that lost(humiliatingly) despite after delivering so well during his rule. Nitish willrue those two days (cancellation of Dinner for Modi in 2010 and breaking ofalliance in 2013) in his political career when he tried to project him as antimodi face(c) Lalu emergesas the face of opposition in Bihar(d) Rahul takescongress not just another, but an important step closer to Mahatma Gandhi’swish of congress mukt Bharat.(e) The largescale desertion from congress (may be some split) and other parties towards NDAin the rest of the country.(f)   The surprisefactor for UP assembly polls in 2017 dies in Nov. 2015 itself.Spolier for NDA: Any other statement (s) like the one on thereservation by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. It has the potential to change thewhole game.</comment>

<comment>Ha ha. Finally reality bit fake party. Tell me, why are you not blaming ec yet? </comment>

<comment>Bjp poised to win this electing election?</comment>

<comment>BJP will win Bihar this time this BJP march to glory & Indian march to gloriness, all the road blocking looters will be smashed on the way BJP march.</comment>

<comment>When Manmohan Ji was PM, Modi Ji was shouting on each n every small issue but when he is PM then he can't say even a word on important issues</comment>

<comment>PM is doing his job not giving statement, when bullock cart moves on the road some street dogs like Kejirwal, Lalu & Sonia will bark that we have to ignore.</comment>

<comment>What work? Onion 60 rs per kg Dal 170 rs per kg farmers r committing suicide ? During last one year crime against women increased 8%</comment>

<comment>No buying Onion for 20 and selling for 40, spreading Dengue, patients dying without hospital & pollution, free WiFI in Delhi airport, schools & colleges in Mumbai, law & order in USA</comment>

<comment>What price did AK buy the onions for and for how much did he sell :D</comment>

<comment>We need to get rid of ISIS pigs from Bihar. Jai Shivaji</comment>

<comment>ISIS agents Lalu , Nitish & Sonia</comment>

<comment>First achievement of moddisir's foreign policy. Country like Nepal has threatened India to behave and went to UN with a complaint. This is achhe din in foreign policy.... </comment>

<comment>Thank you. Great achievement. India needs to look after its interests as Modi Sir is doing. Nepal tries to blackmail India and since Inda is not agreeing, cry baby is going to UN. Jai Shivaji</comment>

<comment>Jai Maharashtra</comment>

<comment>BJP will definitely get it right this time. There are many factors in its favor :- the credibility of Modi and his promise of development- the negative image of Lallu- the exposed hypocrisy of Nitish- the internal contradictions in the grand alliance- the proven ability of Pappu to benefit the opposition</comment>

<comment>Ya agree, very similar situation like delhi. In Delhi bhjpa got 3/70 with moddisir name. In Bihar, it will get more than 3</comment>

<comment>AAP story starts by 3/70 and also ends by it. Kejirwal is fully exposed, He cannot deliver only thing he can do is blame others for his own failures</comment>

<comment>Bad for Bihar,bad for India if bjp wins,,stopping bjp means stopping hijras,criminals,chors,hawabazs</comment>

<comment>You are referring to yourself only anti national muslims, congressis and corrupt would agree to your point. See the two likes one by yourself and one by Abdul Ali...</comment>

<comment>The more important question is, what will happen to Bihar if BJP comes to power? Development or ban politics? Results or Jhumlas? Hope the best for Bihar.</comment>

<comment>BJP will win Bihar this time with absolute majority.</comment>

<comment>100 % because of Owaisi </comment>

<comment>Yes, owaisi too started supporting BJP. Good. And if BJP does not win, then ISIS/Pak/Scamgress who are helping Nitish.</comment>

<comment>Wow. I was thinking Nitish and JDU were big parties in Bihar from beginning.This shows Nitish is even bigger coward than many outsiders of Bihar know.Despite JDU being a much smaller party and less no of seats, BJP made Nitish as CM and that continued in 2005 and 2010.Now I know why Nitish is out of NDA in 2013. He thought he will be a NDA PM candidate just like in 2000.He realized that BJP is not going to do the same mistake in 2014 and projecting Modi as PM, and out of jealousy and bitterness he ended 17 year old alliance.</comment>

<comment>Modi Ji gave $1 billion to Nepal n in return today Nepal has gone in #UN against India. This is failed overseas policy of PM Modi Ji.</comment>

<comment>Yes, agreed. Our thoughts are same like what our ancestors had for so many years. We always play blame games.</comment>

<comment>This is a temporary phase.  Nepal cannot survive without India being a land locked territory.  China is playing its card there and we have to be alert.  Aiding $1 bn. is not in cash just transferred.  It is for trade credits.  This kind of "show" is necessary, if you know what is international politics.  for e.g. U.S. aiding Pakistan despite Bin Laden was there and chased and killed him.  As an Apptard, you can't even manage a glorified Municipality and you talk of International diplomacy and politics.  Where ignorance is bliss, it is folly to be wise.</comment>

<comment>With moorakh hijda,criminal as PM,what is the use of begger on the street is alert???</comment>

<comment>No point in wasting time man..He thinks NDA formed govt in 1998 because Ayodhya movement happened in 1998..FOrget INternational diplomacy, doesn'r have a clue about what happens in the country..JUst a copy paste spammer, and not even good in it....</comment>

<comment>Owaisi brothers r again threatening BJP leaders. Why only threats? Why don't fight face to face? Oh! Coz they get paid for such statements from BJP</comment>

<comment>hmmm, you seem to know more inside information. Good. Tell me where was i during last vacation? Italy or Bangkok?</comment>

<comment>I know App survives on anarchy.  Your leader is the king of anarchists.  No wonder such statements come from you.</comment>
