<comment>KHAMOSH  !!‚Ä¶.. I am Zahir Ud-din Muhammed Babur ‚Äì a.k.a Emperor Babur, Master of Short and Dark Hindu Slaves‚Ä¶.. I am disappointed that you Hindu slaves have gone back to your infighting again‚Ä¶ Now I will unite all lands of India, Pakistan and Afghanistan again under one rule, under one God Allah and under one flag of Islamic Caliphate. Everybody will behave and obey‚Ä¶. Just like in the old times‚Ä¶.. Smriti Irani will wear a Burkha during the day and dance at gazal parties at night and serve as a ‚Äúsaki‚Äù. Ugly Nitin Gadkari will not  F A R T but hand out land allotments to W H O R E Hema Malini a.k.a. Aisha Bi R. Chakravarty and Gujarat CM Anandiben Patel‚Äôs daughter through Waqf Board‚Ä¶ not under the table‚Ä¶ Delhi will be called ‚ÄúBaburabad‚Äù.  //.</comment>

<comment>CORRECT, THIS IS VERY MUCH PROVED IN THE TV SHOWS REPRESENTED BY BJP SPOKESPERSON</comment>

<comment>Modi is falling at 20 times the speed at which he rose. He is becoming irrelevant and the government has become a joke.People expected a strong government and a strong PM, but these dudes are proving more useless than Sibal, Salman, Chidambaram and MMS.</comment>

<comment>What you are saying is not true.  Our wonderful Indra Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi presided over low growth and slow growth economies.  On  related note, the Shiv Sena destroys Maharashtra and India, and there is no reason why the Shiv Sena leaders must be given any importance by Narendra Modi and the BJP on national policy issues.</comment>

<comment>MNS presented the economy to BJP with 6.9%GDP, how far we have advanced after that( ) Of-course the same is true for Atalji also ( ) He left a healthy economy for UPA.</comment>

<comment>And how is that? Can the people of this country know? Not inviting Uddhav gives you such feelings? Btw take it from me some sort of an invite will be sent out sometime soon.</comment>
