<comment>man don't waste your time posting this sh1t again you been trying from so may days ..pl understand and tell your master that now here there  are no takers any more for such lies</comment>

<comment>Can't even spell  'Harry' right !</comment>

<comment>Modi can make an offer to congress : Pass GST and become LoP</comment>

<comment>Credit should go to Mister Mani Shankar Iyer whose irresponsible comments describing Modi as "chaiwala", resulted in loss of lakhs of votes to congress party.  Now, congress is loosing heavily because of low grade comments by Rahul as "suit boot ki sarkar".  We the people are watching the party and its cheap politics.</comment>

<comment>and actually their karnataka CM is caught wearing a watch worth of 70 lakhs, they are poor paijama kurha looters</comment>

<comment>These Congressees are always fighting for ministerial bungalow. NDA had to take lot of pain to kick out them from Bungalows. Now other than Rahul & Sonia, the opposition leader  will not get the Ministerial Bungalow. Only solace for Congress is Sonia lives in a bigger house than Prime Minister. </comment>

<comment>congress begging for Lop : bhagwan ke nam pe kuch dedo bhaiyya2 saal se bina power se guzar raha hunbhagwan ke nam pe kuch dedo bhaiyya</comment>

<comment>Congress is free to talk against the country, as nobody seems to care. But, let them not talk in contempt of the court, which will surely land them in jail.</comment>

<comment>Now these scumb@gs are looking fool in front of people.</comment>

<comment>Poor Congress ....... after sixty years ..... no one recognize you ... how pathetic .....</comment>

<comment>Good. Our mission is congress free india.</comment>

<comment>Congress when it was in power it has 206 MP's. Out of these 33 MP's are from andhra pradesh. Now after dividing AP they got only 2 out of 17 in telangana. They lost deposit in 25 out of 25 seats in Andhra pradesh. Congress went down from whooping 45% in 2009 to 2.1% in 2014 in andhra pradesh.In 2009 congress MP's from AP=33 where as in 2014 total MP's from overall India=44. Now u can imagine the pathetic situation for congress in AP. All the congress offices are closed in AP. There is no scope of revival for congress in AP for coming 25 years atleast to win 1 seat in AP.</comment>

<comment>Sonia and RG are just idiots of first order. They have zero charisma compared to YSR. Maino thought she was the boss and eliminated YSR only to realize that she is zero without leaders like him.</comment>

<comment>if Pappu is given party leadership, what happened in Andhra is going to happen nation wide.By the way, 33 MPs from Andhra was not because of SOnia or Pappu. it was YSR personal capacity</comment>

<comment>You are 100% right, and those 33 seats from AP were because of YSR, not Rahul/Sonia duo.</comment>

<comment>We hope what happened in AP, also happens all over India soon ! What AP does today, India does tomorrow ...</comment>

<comment>I don't think they're learning. Now they're ganging up with local mafias.</comment>

<comment>How begging these scamngress people shame on you</comment>

<comment>After losing majority, they did not want to face the floor test as asked by the Governor. The Speaker was used to manipulate the majority by disqualifying a few and not permitting the resignation of some. Now SC might think that once in the Parliament case, Speaker is reduced to shambles, Arunachal will prove fatal. Congress is digging its own ground.</comment>

<comment>Poor Sickulars ! Why don't you all - Congress, AAP, Commie's, TMC, Nitisswa, Lalua, Mulla M, just merge and form a new party : Sickular Party of India ( if you feel offended by the word India, just drop it )! Your leader will automatically get the LOP status - and you can have a rotational formula whereby every month the leader could change ! Sab ko chance milega, mil baat ke khana !</comment>

<comment>Good suggestion.</comment>

<comment>SABKA SAATH HOGA AUR SABKA VIKAAS HOGA.</comment>

<comment>Today we shall celebrate by bursting crackers. A Party with 125 years of history (as they boast) has been reduced to zero status in just a matter of two elections by the great Sonia Maino with her mafioso mindset. Good going Scamgress.</comment>

<comment>One more session of Parliament will go down the drain...</comment>

<comment>this paves the way for National Herald case!!</comment>

<comment>truth prevails ....  good move</comment>

<comment>Tight slap on Rahul Moron Gandhi</comment>

<comment>That settles it.  You cannot snatch what you don't deserve.  The Congress must have been ashamed to fight their own case and afraid of being reminded of their own mis-deeds of the past.</comment>

<comment>There is ruckus created in the Parliament if somebody celebrates the birth or the death anniversary of (Nathuram) Godse. Why Congress does not create a ruckus now when a day of remembrance is being observed for Afzal Guru.”</comment>

<comment>100 whips each in DASH the for each of these 44 congressis</comment>
