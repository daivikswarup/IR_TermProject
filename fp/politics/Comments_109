<comment>Caution - Big Danger ahead. L&T in melting, another Satyam in making - L&T like Satyam was barred by World Bank over FORGERY. PM Mr Modi should intervene to fix retirement age at L&T to 60. L&T was founded in year 1938 by Danish engineers Mr Larsen and Mr Toubro. Now state owned LIC and UTI are majority stakeholders. Likes of Chairman Mr Naik (aged 73) joined L&T as entry level engineers in 60s are treating L&T as their personal fiefdom. To quote Mr Naik "there is no bloody owner at L&T". Its not just Mr Naik L&T is personal fiefdom (like BCCI) of a old-men club, it is divided between septuagenarians vertical wise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CEO Mr Vekataramanan responsible for Hydrocarbon business and its heavy losses (alas hanged his boots). Please refer BS article - Oct 2, 2015 - Financial mismanagement charges see a dozen leaving L&T arm. What happened to Mr Naik's schizophrenic Business Plans - excepts from an interview with BS - Feb 2014 - L&T needs younger leadership --- "I won’t get best talent globally, as they have reservations about working for an Indian company. And, live in India, where quality of life is an issue. So, we have decided to move our business headquarters to Dubai. We have found an Italian who will take over one part of the hydrocarbon business.". All these gentleman are nearly or above 70. Career span of nearly 50 years as paid employees in a company where state owned LIC/UTI are biggest stake holders - SCANDALOUS - in a country where millions are job less. PM Mr Modi, should intervene to fix retirement age at LnT from SCANDALOUS 75 to 60 - ASAP!!---------------------------------------------------------How about - this -- L&T Infotech tries to remain in news by giving Reset Time Line of $1 billion in revenues TARGET. Founded as L&T-IT in late 80s renamed to L&T Infotech on 1st April, 1997, can someone change his Date of Birth by changing name? May, 2006 – ET - L&T Infotech eye $1 bn turnover by 10 – excerpts - looking at a target of $ 1 billion by 2010 A M Naik told reporters. The Hindu - May 30, 2006 - L&T Infotech plans stock exchange listing – excerpts - IPO some time in 2008 to make L&T Infotech more answerable to customer, Mr. Naik told reporters. ET May, 2009 - No regrets over Satyam AM Naik – excerpts -I think L&T Infotech will achieve $1 billion mark by 2012. Mr Magapu is responsible for stagnating IT business L&T Infotech and L&T Tech services - Infotech is well proven laggard in IT space, Mr Deosthali is CEO of L&T Finance holding - share gone no where in last few years, Mr MV Kotwal man in charge of L&T's defence forays - stagnating 'ahead in time' investment of 5k crores.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------L&T in melting - devil or the deep blue sea - stake sale or post losses.

Would it hit a 3 yr low of 722 ?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------L&T, true legacy of founders Mr Larsen and Mr Toubro - as on today is a Despotic Geritocracy - by, for of schizophrenic geriatric leadership/top-brasses - leading the pack is Geriatric in Chief Mr Naik. Here is crucible of L&T’s ills – most despotic and garrulous nonsense by Mr Naik on succession - why Mr Naik is slogging at 72 – QUOTE- You find a man in the world who will kill himself four times a day, has worked for more than a hundred years-- There is no such person.-- None of us here (at senior level) are working for money -UNQUOTE. Please refer ToI article – Vibrant Gujarat summit Day 1: 25 private jets bring high-flyers. Excerpts –Cabinet ministers arrived via scheduled flights -- private jet of AM Naik left immediately after arriving –. When L&T will get leaders in 40s – like Infosys, TATA, and Microsoft ??------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Any CXO/MD level official at L&T ever got fired in last 5/10 years or resigned on morals grounds? Please refer TOI article – “whistleblower was right: CBI”. Excerpts – “Golden Quadrilateral Project -- M/s LnT had misrepresented the facts”. BS Article – “Rajya Sabha nods for whistle blowers bill” – excerpts – “Prasad recalled the sacrifice of Satyendra Dubey, an Indian Engineering Service officer who was killed after he tried to reveal corruption in the Golden Quadrilateral”. Please GOOGLE – white collar criminal equivalent of rape and murder- “Class Action Suit Seeks $100 Million for Pregnancy Discrimination, Other Violations”. Please refer International Business Times article – “$100 Million Sought as New Discrimination, Immigration Violations Complaint Filed against LnT”. Got slapped with ban by World Bank – please refer ET article – “World Bank bars LnT for 6 months over forgery”. To quote Mr Naik "CEO and company are two sides of the same coin, they represent each other. All and sundry above 60 at L&T leading the pack Mr Naik (aged 73) Leave Now!!</comment>
