<comment>AAP seems to be going the paki way. They seem to breathe and live "Conspiracy theories". If at all the DP slipped up it was that there weren't any women constables around as I can surmise from the photos doing the rounds. Naturally the woman got close enough since the DP men were obviously hesitant to physically prevent her. Had they done so there would have been a major backlash on the insensitvity shown. And the fact that she was actually associated with AAP, disgruntled or not, helped a lot. The fact is AAP leadership is exclusively made up of rustic cowbelt hicks and so conspiracy theories come easily to them.</comment>
