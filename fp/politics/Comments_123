<comment>BJP n congress does have problem with this anti national party PDP </comment>

<comment>(1) Kashmirpolitics is at crossroads as Ms Mehbooba is yet to decide whether her party’salliance with BJP would continue. But one thing is absolutely clear. I believethat all those political parties in Kashmir who want azadi or freedom fromIndian rule, and more particularly withdrawal of our Army from Kashmir, should beready to accept ground reality that Kashmir is and will remain a part of IndianUnion. (2) NDA government has made it clear that all political parties’ leadersin Kashmir as also the separatists cannot meet Pakistani officials or theirAmbassador in India and discuss their demands with them. Separatists have toensure that their azadi and other demands are not in conflict with ourConstitution.  (3) Hence it will beinteresting to watch next moves of Ms Mehbooba Mufti.</comment>

<comment>NC/PDP/CONG find themselves in a Fix</comment>

<comment>PDP forms the govt. with Cong. = more seats for the BJP in next elections.</comment>

<comment>And also Congress will displace PDP with NC. It will try to put the Abdullahs back in power.  Rahul and Sonia do not care for the country.  They just want to hold on to power for themselves and their dynasty.</comment>

<comment>If PDP ties up with Congress, why would the center provide 70K crore which is required to run J&K?</comment>

<comment>The BJP should limit its losses and get out of the coalition with PDP. Mehbooba will be a pain in BJP's rear. Instead BJP should play the role of a responsible opposition party. That way it allows for Jihadists (PDP, Congress, NC) to form a unity government in J&K - mutual destruction is assured. The fact that the BJP chose not to enforce the constitution and allow Nirmal Singh to automatically become the CM, and instead seek imposition of President's rule until Her Highness decides is antithetical to the established principles of democracy. </comment>

<comment>BJP's doing it for a few Rajya Sabha Seats</comment>

<comment>if Mehbooba Sayedi now  partners with Congress , it will be betraying people who voted Congress out of power.</comment>

<comment>Let is not forget that BJP got slightly more number of popular votes than the PDP in the State of Jammu and Kashmir.</comment>

<comment>Why not a BJP+NC goverment with support of independents. Why no one in media is discussing this possibility</comment>

<comment>If Mufti Mohamed Sayyed had not died, the government would have been a PDP-BJP one with the deputy CM from BJP. Mehbooba not continuing the arrangement will be a betrayal to Mufti and also to the people of Jammu and Kashmir(ladakh).</comment>

<comment>The Congress party will engineer the political demise of Mehbooba Mufti in the long run.  Sonia Gandhi, Rahul GAndhi and Ambika Soni are certified political frauds.</comment>

<comment>Tie up with congress means tie up with NC as well, J&K people did not vote PDP to get back the filth they have just thrown out, it will be a political suicide.</comment>

<comment>The BJP has lost its first battle to PDP, in present political scenario. As per the precedence, the senior most person should be in helm, immediately in absence of head of state. The governor should have called Mr. Nirmal Singh to take oath as Chief Minister of Jammu & Kashmir, immediately after the death of Mufti. It would have been an after scene if She or Council of Ministers decide not to back him as CM. It was a constitutional impropriety, committed in State of Jammu & Kashmir.</comment>
