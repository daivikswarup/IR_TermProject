<comment>Fake Fake fake Fake</comment>

<comment>Interesting, so the Muslims, Yadavs, and Kurmis overwhelming vote for the JD(U), while OBCs, SC/STs, and upper castes vote for the BJP. Yet somehow the BJP is the "communal" party and the JD(U) is "secular"!</comment>

<comment>महागठबंधन हुआ ही ये देख कर लोक सभा चुनाव में की:भाजपा के 30% वोट पासवान के 5% वोट कुशवाहा के 3% वोट मिलकर 38% होते हुए भी जीत गएक्यूंकि दूसरी तरफलालू के 19% वोट नितीश के 16% वोट कांग्रेस के 9% वोट 43% होते हुए भी क्यूंकि अलग अलग थे सो हार गएऔर तो और वो लोक सभा चुनाव थे और लोग PM चुन रहे थे और उसमें मोदी की लहर चल रही थी !अब 2015 में विधान सभा चुनाव है, लोग CM चुन रहे हैं, और मोदी न सिर्फ CM नहीं बनेंगे बल्कि मोदी के डेढ़ साल के काम को भी लोग नाप रहे हैं! आखिर तब भी मोदी ने बिहार से कई वादे किये ही थे !लगता ऐसा ही है की लोक सभा वाला गठबंधन तब के अपने 38% से कुछ नीचे ही जायेगा और लोक सभा चुनाव का ही बिखरा हुआ 43% वाले लोगों का गठबंधन कुछ आगे ही बढ़ेगा !</comment>

<comment>Don't be a casteist.</comment>

<comment>8% upper caste support JDU+ in Bihar as per survey.</comment>

<comment>BJP WILL GET MORE THAN 200 SEATS PROVIDED IT ANNOUNCES FIRM PLAN TO CURB CORRUPTION & CONVICTION OF CORRUPTS IN BIHAR WHICH IS BIGGEST HURDLE FACED BY PEOPLE OF STATE. THE CORRUPTION IS CONTINUING SINCE LAST 60 YEARS OF CORRUPT & BAD GOVERNANCE BY TRIO CONGRESS-RJD-JD(U) WHO SHOULD NOT BE VOTED AGAIN IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHO ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ACUTE POVERTY & BACKWARDNESS ALL OVER STATE IN LAST 60 YEARS. BJP SHOULD NOT DELAY IN DECLARING WAR AGAINST CORRUPTION WHICH WILL ENSURE BJP VICTORY IN ASSEMBLY ELECTION. THE WIN OF RJD-JD(U) ALLIANCE WILL RUIN BIHAR.</comment>

<comment>I think you added one zero by mistake</comment>

<comment>Only an annihilation of the BJP will save the farmers and labourers of this Country and their fate depends on the mood of Bihari voters which I hope will favour largely Nitish and Company irrespective of whatever reasons they exercise their franchise for !?</comment>

<comment>YES SAY LOUDLY I LOVE POOR LIFE, TO BE A SMALL CREATURE, AND BE A PUPPET OF CRIMINALS!</comment>

<comment>BJP MP in Bihar itself has accused the party of selling out tickets to criminals, dynasts, boot leggers money bags etc. So much for their credibility !! ROFL !!</comment>

<comment>iF that is true like you say, whatever money they make by selling country like india wholesale, will haunt them even after they die. such a great heritage, and being corrupted for what? lust of money!</comment>

<comment>Yayyy....Nitish for Bihar.Surprisingly, the mahagathbandhan is actually quiet united even with big egos involved unlike the mahagaathbandhan of modi,paswan and manjhi</comment>

<comment>in the olden times bihar was famous as Home To Lord Krishna, Enlightenment Place of Lord Buddha, empire of Maurya dynasty, Nalanda University, capital of samrat Asoka.Present Day Bihar is Known for Discounting Criminals, Loose Law Enforcement and Bollywood Crime Movies like Gangajal, Wasseypur.Time For Change (Modi) or Time For Another Horror (Alliance Raaj)!</comment>

<comment>Gujarat was known for Gandhi. Now, it is know for riots</comment>

<comment>Still Gujarat is known for Gandhi only. Where ever  the corrupt congress are there even in BJP states also, these dirty and stupid politicians  are only doing riots, like they have done in Varanasi recently and in 1984 riots etc etc lot more</comment>

<comment>Also Maharshi Valmiki of Ramayana lived here. Lord Mahavir Founder of Jainism, & Guru Gobind Singh, Guru of Sikhs were born here!</comment>

<comment>Krishna was born in Mathura and raised in Gokul. Both are in present day UP, you idi0t.</comment>

<comment>All these "pollsters" are going to have egg all over their faces ones the results are out.  We will only have to hear all of them touting out various reasons why they are still right, but for xyz factors.  Their contorted explanations are going to be interesting.</comment>

<comment>If BJP looses Bihar , then Bihari's themselves has to blame for welcoming the JUNGLE Raj and lawlessness. This is the best time for people to give chance to BJP because they are there in center also. Every party has given a chance then why not try BJP . But if people vote in caste lines then they shouldn't complain about development and industrialization  not happening in Bihar.</comment>

<comment>As I said earlier, people get what they deserve.If Nitish wins he will keep braking on Modi and Central govt like Kejriwal.</comment>

<comment>Not more than 0.001 % of real voters of Bihar is commenting here.Comments are coming from nationwide public</comment>

<comment>From across the globe ... </comment>

<comment>If Kejruddeen can win in Delhi, than Lalu alliance can win in Bihar.Crux :- If you can fool people in Delhi, surely you can fool people in Bihar.</comment>

<comment>paid.. paid.. paid.. paid.. paid.. paid.. paid.. paid..</comment>

<comment>Whats common between Sickularists, Sickular media, FP & Mungerilal? :-)</comment>

<comment>CONG-AAP-JDU-RJD alliance will winAK Sir will get help from Sonia Madam and Lalu sir to win this election</comment>

<comment>Lalu Sir?</comment>

<comment>lol</comment>

<comment>So Bihar wants to remain as the worst state of India and send their people to other states for Work.</comment>

<comment>This survey is way off mark like the Zee News. The fight is going to be close one and the winner will be revealed only on 8th Nov. Beef Controversy has taken away a chunk of Yadav voters which is not captured in any survey but evident on faces of Lalu and Nitish.</comment>

<comment>IF JD(U) Wins its JUNGLE RAAJ PART DOOSRA!. I AM CONFIDENT PEOPLE OF BIHAR LOVE THEIR FAMILY AND STATE ENOUGH TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE.</comment>

<comment>Both Nitish & Laloo have cheated people of Bihar in last 25 years by digging grave for people of state. Both destroyed Bihar by giving corrupt & bad governance. RJD, JD(U) should not be voted in any circumstances since both will bring JUNGLE RAJ -2 in state. Both parties are responsible for present severe drought conditions in state since all development funds are looted by corrupt politicians in past 25 years.</comment>

<comment>I wonder how much money this paid journo has got from Nitish and Co.</comment>

<comment>Haan bhai..survey toh sirf delhi ke galat hote hai :-P :-P </comment>

<comment>Hopefully; Nitish combine are winning and making government in Bihar. all the very best for both of them. Modi's silence on Sushma, Vasundre, Shiv Raj Chouhan and then Dadri could prove to be very harmful for the party in the State of Bihar. The people want good governance of Nitish combine for another at least 10 years.</comment>

<comment>Very good. I can now rely on Bihari workers to work in my factory in Maharashtra at cheap rates, If bihar develops I will not be able to get cheap labour from Bihar. Please elect Nitish and Laloo. Hence very cheap labour for me.</comment>

<comment>Then after voting for Lallo they will leave bihar in search of food and water and go to Maharashtra and Gujarat to earn a living. Meanwhile their wife will stay back in Bihar and laloo party and Nitish party will take good care of her,,</comment>

<comment>Like all men in Gujarat took care of yashoda's 'needs' after her husband ran away.</comment>

<comment>There should be ban on pre poll surveys and discussions afterward which mislead n confuse VOTERS........</comment>

<comment>JD(U)-RID will win and Nitish Kumar will become Chief Minister again. There can be no controversy about it. In Bhiar, the secular forces are clearly ahead of the communal forces.</comment>

<comment>Mr Mukho your seculars have to travel to communal states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab and Bangalore to earn a living. I wonder when U secular figotts will learn that a secular CM who cannot even feed its state citizens and create jobs for them should not open their mouths, U are shameless.</comment>

<comment>What is "communal state"? Laughable. Bhajju log kya school nahi jate? YOU are communal, the state's people are secular. People are never communal, YOU are communal.</comment>

<comment>gujarati and punjabis  go to outside India to earn their living.</comment>

<comment>Then after voting for Lallo they will leave bihar in search of food and water and go to Maharashtra and Gujarat to earn a living. Meanwhile their wife will stay back in Bihar and laloo party and Nitish party will take good care of her.</comment>

<comment>Economic immigration is a reality. It is happening in every part of world. I am a Bihari living in London from last 10 years. People. Are coming to uk from countries like Romania,Poland.</comment>

<comment>lol...so true</comment>

<comment>if that happens, Bihar will continue to remain a bhikhari state.</comment>

<comment>All PAID surveys to mislead the people. "PUBLIC SAB JAANTI HAI".</comment>

<comment>My fellow Bihari citizens, It's high to make all the opinion Poll false and to give a decisive mandate for BJP and NDA. Defeat all the corrupt and self centered persons like Nitish and Lalu. Vote once for BJP and you will again and again vote for them. Give them a fair chance.</comment>

<comment>Both Nitish & Laloo have cheated people of Bihar in last 25 years by digging grave for people of state. Both destroyed Bihar by giving corrupt & bad governance. RJD, JD(U) should not be voted in any circumstances since both can bring JUNGLE RAJ -2 in state.</comment>

<comment>You are scaremongering. Every state and party has problems. Each party has its own ideology and its base. Let the people decide what they want to do. And accept the public verdict . If you are really interested in Bihar politicas then give development statistics on various from to prove ur point. Don,t use rhetoric.</comment>

<comment>I don't want to see people from other states making comments that does not connect. Anyone from Bihar who can actually throw light on the mood of people? What do you guys think, Bihari's are in favor of grand alliance or NDA?</comment>

<comment>Grand Alliance</comment>

<comment>I dont want people of Bihar comming to dirty my state</comment>

<comment>I belong to the state of Bihar. There, if you ask an upper caste person, he will say NDA. If you ask others, they will say Grand alliance. and If you ask others in front of upper caste Biharis, they will say NDA; but during voting, they will vote for grand alliance.</comment>

<comment>Then after voting for Lallo they will leave bihar in search of food and water and go to Maharashtra and Gujarat to earn a living. Meanwhile their wife will stay back in Bihar and laloo party and Nitish party will take good care of her</comment>

<comment>Yes you are absolutely correct. But if NDA comes to power, then they will not let the Biharis go out of state to earn livelihood. Uppercastes will then take care of the women folk of other castes in front of their men folk and men folk will be enslaved to work for their farmlands and factories, without any voice. Its a real dilemma, of a feudal society..</comment>

<comment>These news channels are cheating people by taking money from political parties.</comment>

<comment>What a sham,it's a paid survey to confuse the voters....NDA WILL SURPRISE AGAIN LIKE UP IN THE LOK SABHA ELECTIONS.</comment>

<comment>Congress getting 20 seats :D</comment>

<comment>Yes, that is why Pappu is conspicuous by his absence. In the "Heads I win, Tails you lose"  theory of the crooked family and it's stooges, Pappu should be seen everywhere to take credit for the "20 seats". But, he seems to be away so that the forthcoming shameful show can be attributed to other factors.:D</comment>

<comment>Nitish is going to lose in Bihar due to corrupt & bad governance. He failed in fulfilling most of promises made to people like assured supply of electricity in all places including rural areas but he failed miserably. So people are fade up with liar politicians like Laloo & Nitish who have cheated people of Bihar in last 25 years. Congress, regional parties like RJD, JD(U), SP, NCP etc & smaller parties like HAM, LJP, RLSP etc are corrupt party which are ONE MAN SHOW & have no internal democracy which is run for dynasty. What has happened in 15 years RJD Jungle Raj is well known in Bihar. Nitish has connived with convicted criminal LALOO to bring JUNGLE RAJ -2 in state. The coming elections in Bihar is do or die situation for public in which survival of people are at stake. There is no change or progress all over state in last 60 years when basic facilities like education, medical facilities, drinking water, electricity, rural roads, irrigation facility in rural areas, unemployment, poverty elevation, backwardness are not removed in past Congress- RJD- JD(U) misgovernance. What people will get after voting to this trio of corrupts who devastated this country by promoting massive corruption, communalism, castism, regionalism, terrorism, creating rift among different communities ? The continuation of such situation will ruin Bihar if Congress, regional & smaller parties are not defeated in assembly elections since all these parties are ONE MAN show for running DYNASTY politics. Now people has only alternative left i.e BJP provided this party ensures corruption free good governance by selecting qualified, intelligent, capable & experienced candidates. There is hue & cry over selection of criminals as candidates by all parties.This is not acceptable to people of state who should defeat all such criminals in coming election who will provide corrupt & bad governance if voted to power as happened in past 68 years. The people must take full precaution while voting to criminals who must be defeated at all costs. Only honest, qualified, young (less than 60 years) candidates should be voted for good & efficient governance for peace & prosperity of Bihar. The past blunder of electing corrupt & non-performing parties should not be repeated again & again. THE VOTING TO TRIO ALLIANCE OF RJD - JD(U)- CONGRESS WILL AGAIN BRING COMPLETE JUNGLE RAJ - 2 IN BIHAR WHICH WILL SPREAD ANARCHY & TURMOIL ALL OVER STATE RESULTED IN FURTHER POVERTY & BACKWARDNESS. BJP should be voted to power with absolute majority but this party must perform as per people's desire & ensure rapid development. The Corruption must be curbed at all cost which major irritant in progress of Bihar.</comment>

<comment>IT LOOKS LIKE  U R A BJP AGENT;;IT SEEMS THAT U AHVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO WRITE IN LARGE AS MODI SPEAKS IN LARGE; BIHAR IS OUT OF BIMARU STATE ONLY BECAUSE OF NITISH KUMAR; SO DO'NT WORRY NITISH SHALL BE CM NOW--- & AFTER THAT HAWA NIKLEGA BJP-NDA BALO KA---PASWAN AAP KI BIWI KA NAAM BATAEGA--GIRIRAJ SINGH AAPKI MUSLIM WIFE KA BAREME BATAYE GA-- ETC ETC--</comment>

<comment>The people should see national interest which is beneficial for all rather than aligning with any party because all parties are equally corrupt but there is some check in national party while regional & smaller parties are pocket party of individual who are cheating people as they are master & there is no check over them. What Laloo & Nitish have done for Bihar is visible everywhere. These parties are useless & have no capability and vision to make development. Those voting to Laloo & Nitish are senseless people & are sealing their future.</comment>
