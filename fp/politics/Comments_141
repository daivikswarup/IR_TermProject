<comment>Very well written article. But if you have emphasized more on What Mr.CBN has done in the last 18+ plus could have been better.Mr. CBN couldn't fight BJP for Special status which is AP right after separation as promised by BJP & Congress.Shame on Mr.CBN engouh of politics and false promises do something for people who believed you blindly.So far Mr.CBN has done NOTHING. He took the chair with false promises and deceiving all class of people and morover looting poor people land with force and leaving his croonies lands for real estate businesses.Ex: Before Hitech city annoncement in Madhapur Hyd. Mr.CBN made Jayabheri and some other croonies to buy lands in surrounding areas for cheaper cost then with announcement they made 1000's of crores with single Project. Just imagineSame is repeating new capital Amaravati. this time partnering Singapore companies it seems. But result will b same.</comment>

<comment>I really don't get why the guy out on bail get to make all these statements without no shame or guilt. The guy with a pending case is the opposition leader, with a newspaper and a TV channel to go with his madness.</comment>

<comment>Dear Venky Jagan has cases on him which  he says political and none of them proved so far. so just based on cases we can't call some one guilty.No cases on Mr.Babu doesn't mean he is Clean. people have witnessed his corruption & Bribery act to buy an MLC for 5 Crores where Mr.CBN was caught red handed. still cases are not moving ahead. that doesn't mean Mr.CBN is clean.What I am saying unless cases are proved. we can't call some 1 guilty. Be it Mr.CBN or Jagan</comment>

<comment>Okay, if they are wrong he wouldn't have stayed in jail, I donno for how long exactly. Would've protested against the case against him, made a fuss about it by now, which he didn't can only mean all those were true. And also ACB or any other law enforcement wouldn't be able to go so far without any proof. He is just out on bail, not acquitted.Same goes for Mr.Babu as well about note for vote case, all he says is "what I'm saying is..." or "How can they do sting on another state C.M, It's against rules "  but never denies it.  People aren't too dumb as justice systemto believe 'not guilty unless proven '</comment>

<comment>How can they do sting on another state C.M, It's against rules - FUNNY.If he is CM he can offer bribe... he can do corruption what kind of logic it is? if a small peoun or tahsildar caught in bribery for 5000 etc that is big news and suspension of Job...When it comes CM offering bribe it is against what kind of logic is this? even if such rule is there that rule is wrong. Ok. forget about rules think neutral do you accept that?he is CM means public servant like any govt official he also comes under ACB. Same has happend ther.</comment>

<comment>Dumbest analysis I have ever read on firstpost in my experience of several years...looks like a paid article...</comment>

<comment>well what do u expect from a xtian media</comment>

<comment>should have seen his articles before 2014 elections</comment>

<comment>This author is a known boot licker of YS Jagan, nobody even bothered about his so called fast except Sakshi, all telugu media is in criticism of Jagan for not wanting to get invited-even great andhra Jagan biased internet portal, but still this fellow sees it as a masterstroke.</comment>

<comment>sure looks like it.</comment>
