<comment>Where is vikas rath? Dal is 200 rs now. Forget the beef, ppl will stop eating dal. Did u not see my program?</comment>

<comment>Yes sir we saw it. But todays news it showed that you and your supporting party stocked 5k tonnes of dal in different countries which was the reason for dal price hike. Well played ! ;)</comment>

<comment>U fool.. max amount of hoarding was recovered from M P which is B J P ruled state</comment>

<comment>So acoording to you BJP stocked all these DAL so that people could turn against them.wow I think you better call yourself fool. I will give a a hint son, Its opposition that are doing that cause they could blame the party in power....all because they jelous...hehe sorry i dont know any other reasonIndia is run by BJP yet if BJP is causing all these issues then they would know it will turn against them. Or may some corrupt people are there in BJP who are influenced by opposition party. These things wont happen if no one has to gain anything over it.</comment>

<comment>Basically u have proved to be completely dumb.The hoarding is done, neither by congress nor by BJP. It is done by the hoarders. The congress is anyways a useless party which will be finished in next 5 yrs. My question is why is BJP not acting against the hoarders till DAL reached 210 kgs. At least now they are doing which is good. They did the same mistake of not acting against hoarders earlier, and lost an elections over onions in Delhi. Now again we saw onion prices spike earlier this year which is bad news for them.Now coming to you. Stop your blind bhakti and understand the reality. Unless we criticize the govt, they will not know what mistake they are doing. I voted for BJP this election and sincerely wish they do well. But I will not close my eyes when they make mistakes.</comment>

<comment>Its not like hoarders hide the dal and announced come find us :D they hide that no one knew about it, until the price began to rise up. Then government made efforts and succeeded. This is a process and takes time. You start criticizing before anything happens....and now what you take your criticism back ?Its not blind bakthi.....its called trust...if you have voted then give them chance. Its not like you vote one day and suddenly the country looks clean and good.Have faith. Dont loose your mind.....all are not good people. There are barriers and dirty politics and in time lets hope everything clears out.</comment>

<comment>You are also one of soundbite champion. Obviously hatemongers in BJP are not listening to Arun Jaitley.</comment>

<comment>This problem of law and order is coming due to attitude of BJP and RSS.</comment>

<comment>It is very heartening to hear Mr jaitley"s statement on the need for rational thinking and debate instead of vandalism or obscurantism irrespective of  party affiliations. The relevant issue is why are these element from fringe groups and even their ally  indulging in such actions in a more blatant manner. The Centre's reaction that it is a State subject is perhaps taken as a tacit acceptance by the Central Govt. While one appreciates the action taken against some elements within their own party, these very same persons deny that they were pulled up!! The Centre should lay down strict guidelines from the MHA on such flagrant actions against the oerptrators of actions against the unity and diversity of the country</comment>

<comment>Don't just keep issuing statements. Make it clear to all the state Govt. that, it is their prime duty to safe guard the lives and property of the citizens. If possible bring new laws to curb this menace as soon as possible. Keep visiting the victims and the affected areas where ever disturbances happens. Make sure that there is a RULE OF LAW, without taking into consideration the religion or the caste of creed of the affected person. Give full powers to the Police and hold them accountable.</comment>

<comment>What prevents him from taking suo moto action against Mahesh Sharma, Giriraj Kishore etc., who are always in the habit of making inflammatory statements as an impulsive reaction to communal incidents ?  Was a show cause notice atleast served on such perpetual offenders ?  If a PM himself is totally indifferent to such provocative statements emanating from his own Ministry, how can he inspire confidence to outsiders that he means business ??</comment>

<comment>suo moto action for what Moron !!!!</comment>

<comment>Rediff comWill invite Malala with open arms if she comes to India: Shiva Sena:  Amidst their protests against Pakistan, Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut has said that if Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai came to India, she would be welcomed with open arms. "If Malala comes to India, we will welcome her. She's a child who has borne the horror of Pakistan terrorism and till date she continues her fight against terrorism," said Raut.Now Prestitute media and congress will say Malala is also a right wing and she is from RSS !!!!</comment>

<comment>Distilled idiot and egregious Liar,Do not hallucinate with intake of heavy drugs !!</comment>

<comment>Chu tiya why don't u verify with Rediff before u use irrational brain !!!</comment>

<comment>He He !! Another dirty Sanghi on the prowl !?</comment>

<comment>MC go ask mother why she u sending to troll here !!!</comment>

<comment>You religious zombie. Get lost !!</comment>

<comment>BC does ur sister keep trolling people in market !!!</comment>

<comment>We know that hallucinating about the whereabouts of Mothers and Sisters of others is what is being mentally drilled in your daily Shakhas !?</comment>

<comment>MC does mother also keep trolling the markets , why can't u go and help them than trolling here at least they will get more customers !!!</comment>

<comment>By the way, I have a suspicion that you are that egregious liar  Shashidhar himself !? You are exposing yourself with your inept and clumsy flow of language !?</comment>

<comment>D*ck head not sure whom all ur family troll in night times and whom all u keep trolling !!!use ur d*ck brain and help ur family</comment>

<comment>Good Sanghi butler  English !! Keep it up !!</comment>

<comment>u seem to have learnt lot of English ur mother customers</comment>

<comment>I don't debate with Dirty Pigs</comment>

<comment>He He !!  Again he is short of words to abuse ?  Poor fellow !!You scum and P1g worsh1pper - Who wants to debate with a Moron like you by the way !? But that will not  deter  me in taunting you when you expose your quarter baked knowledge in this forum !!Take my advise seriously meanwhile  and join a nursery school to learn elementary English !!</comment>

<comment>If you want the vandalism and disturbance to stop, then take action against those involved, most of them are from your party and their affiliates. So far, no action has been taken.</comment>

<comment>BJP always indulge in such event... Have you ever found or ever heard that congress is behind some thing like this?BJPians are Inexperience idiots..</comment>

<comment>putting these creeps on notice will not do they need to be got rid of from the party itself other wise they will be a permanent deterrent to pm  modi ,s road to progress  and development not a soul knew these creeps till the bjp govt came to power and the bjp govt came to power only and only because of narendra modi</comment>

<comment>The problem here is that Feku himself is a product of such hooliganism and vandalism. His deification status within the party, larger Sangh Parivar  as well as his followers can be chiefly attributed to  his steering role in the Gujarat Pogrom. Throughout his innings as Gujarat CM, he has made many acerbic, inflammatory, rabble rousing and provocative  speeches ridiculing every Institution little mindful of  the repurcussions. His insinuations against the then Chief Election Commissioner, James Lyndgoh is just one fine example of the extent he can stoop to extract political mileage irrespective of the consequences !!So, if this man who has such a ruffain and hardcore image and is being celebrated by his followers  just for his aggression and gesticulating body language,  suddenly on becoming a Prime Minister emulates a chameleon and starts  makes sanctimonious speeches about tolerance, harmony, brotherhood, restraint etc., who is going to be impressed ?  He will infact become a butt of ridicule for what he is and what he actually represents !!</comment>

<comment>why don't Chu tiya like u fight court cases or appeal , why don't stand against modi and win elections than trolling here !!!</comment>

<comment>Yo Jet Li, Is vandalism a tyranny of the elected, as opposed to the tyranny of the unelected, you nasty two faced liar?</comment>

<comment>I think Jet Li was'nt elected, he came thru the back-door.BJP has  a big majority win but no one competent to be FM...Lets give him credit for the guts to speak out ....since home ministry is quiet??</comment>

<comment>Guts to speak what? Utter crap? Just think about the sentence: 'Tyranny of the unelected'. This is the single most stupidest political term Ive heard in recent months.And hey hooligans don't know what debate is. They only understand lathis. Laaton ke bhoot baaton se nahi maante, you see.</comment>

<comment>When people like Jait(liar) talks sanctimoniously about Parliamentary sovereignity, democratic spirit etc., it can only raise derisive chuckles as to how this shameless bugger  who was defeated in the Lok sabha elections by over a lakh votes and thereby got conclusively rejected by the people,  came through the back door to the office of power by being vested with not just one key Ministry, but two.  Where is the spirit of Democracy here - Jait(liar) when you have vitiated it with your over indulgence  ??Have you any shame at all ? The proof of pudding is in eating !!</comment>

<comment>Donkey like you should not that , Jaitely was already an RS member before even contesting LS elections .kiddo watch some news channel instead of watching cartoon !!!</comment>

<comment>He He !!  Sanghi turd - That is the reason I mentioned in my post that he came through the back door ?  It seems quite similar to that  egregious liar named  Shashidhar, you also have a problem in understanding English !?</comment>

<comment>Chu tiya first learn the elections and ministers work , MC like you were silent when maun mohan singh was PM when he ruled thru RS !!!</comment>

<comment>Two wrongs doesn't make a thing right !!</comment>

<comment>ROFL kiddo first learn how indian parliament works !!!then u can start spamming , every govt has ministers from RS , not sure if have similar democratic process in ur  Pak since its ruled by mullah and terrorists !!!!</comment>

<comment>He He !!  Peoples mandate is secured only through Lok Sabha and not  Rajya Sabha - you Moron where they are just nominated  !!  Do not talk about the virtues of democracy after having flouted it !!</comment>

<comment>MC first learn how constitution works , u r new to indian constitution i doubt in Pak there any thing called constitution</comment>

<comment>It is unfortunate that I need to learn the working of Constitution from a mentally deranged Zombie like you !!</comment>

<comment>pervert pigs  like don't know that RS member can be a minister !!!!dumb pig first learn this</comment>

<comment>Beyond shameless. He still believes India is chock full of bumpkins who think good English mixed in a blender with some Congress digs will give a delicious smoothie to the masses. Well guess what, the more he opens his mouth, the more he makes an idiot out of himself.</comment>

<comment>"The man who knew too much". This liar is full of hubris, smug and self -conceited and deludes that he is the brightest intellectual around. He thinks himself as a the repository of wisdom by commenting on  varied subjects feigning that the Party he represents is a paragon of virtue. But as you rightly said, the more he glibly comments, the more he exposes his intellectual bankruptcy !!</comment>

<comment>Too late. the damage has been done. Modi was trying to carefully rejig himself as the vikas purush but his efforts have been nullified by the loonies. The perception battle has already been lost with many people believing that the goons enjoy tacit and sometimes not so tacit support from the highest levels of the leadership.</comment>

<comment>There was one Sudheendra Kulkarni and then there is this Arun JaitelyKulkarni took down Advani. This guy will take the country, the BJP and Modi down with him</comment>

<comment>They have been on notice since the middle of last year, Jaitley. If the PM was really decisive as ur ppl say, his own party ppl would have heeded him by now. So either Modi tactically supports the statements and comments, or he is too powerless to stop them.</comment>

<comment>"Damned if you Do, Damned if you Don't" That appears to be the mantra of Modi haters. Haters hate. You hate everything Modi does or doesn't do. Hilarious</comment>

<comment>Whom are you fooling  about the so-called decisive action when not even a show cause notice has been served to the offenders within your party as well as in the Ministry  ??</comment>

<comment>DAMNED IF YOU DO, DAMNED IF YOU DON'T. You don't fool anybody with your hatred either.</comment>

<comment>Clearly Modi has been exposed to be a coward.These fringe groups of 100-150 people attack/throw ink somebody and Modi does not have the guts to arrest them and put them behind bars. He does not have the guts to sack people like Adityanath from BJP despite their repeated inflammatory statementsHis CM, Fadnavis does not have the guts to put 2 bit Goondas like Uddhav and his Son behind bars when they are opening abetting the ink attacks and BCCI seige by felicitating the attackers.He does not have the courage to condemn Dadri incident when a man has been lynched for suspicion of eating beefDespite the BJP's position on beef ban, beef exports have risen by 17 % in India since May 2014. Jaitley has subsidized the import of beef cutting machine!!!He has not made any statement about award returns, hate mongering and abuse on social media,houding of dissenters.Basically he is under the shoe of Mohan Bhagwat.And now I wont be surprised if a common citizen like me is hounded by Bhakts for critisizing Modi.</comment>

<comment>Common man like you is bound to complain whether or not good happens. May be you should go to the police and lodge all of these complaints against Modi instead of getting frustrated. Now who else other than Modi do you think is capable of running our country. I bet you wont tell some school boy like Rahul Gandhi who doesnt even know the geographical aspects of the country.Incident may small but thanks to people like you who create a Mayhem of it. All these are bunch of dirty politics anyone can play and put the blame on government.</comment>

<comment>If u cannot understand what is what is written i cant help it. I never spoke abt modi's ability to run the country. I talked about the rising intolerance in the country where everyday there is a incident by wannabe terrorists like shiv sena and some hindu bu!! $hit sena and modi is hiding somewhere like a coward instead of taking these people to task directly.He ia scared to wholeheaetedly condemn dadri incident. He says he regrets it. We have ppl in govt calling it accident. Have we given our country in the hands of hindu taliban?</comment>

<comment>So this rising intolerance has to do something with Modi and shiv sena. Modi not reacting to Shiv sena. Then i am right....you are questioning Modi's ability to run the countryIf not you should not have said that. We dont know who were involved in Dadri incident. We dont know what was it all about whether it was personal or politics. We dont know.Let us pretend some people responsible for this turned out to be some hindu activists, can Modi blame Shiv sena for this. He should show his anger only towards the persons who commited the crime, Unlike some jobless people seems this incident as advantage to blame other party organisationsCmon hindu taliban.  are we talking about armed guys and bombs??? Do u know what a taliban is ? it kills its own people. But shiv sena opposes opposes peoples who support other country's views. Big difference. Hope you get it</comment>

<comment>RSS only defeated Jaitley in last election! And he is Advising RSS!! haha</comment>

<comment>What is this RSS RSS man. Enough of this crap.</comment>

<comment>Its an ISIS like organization rooted in India.</comment>

<comment>You are NO DHARMA. Change your id to ADHARMA.</comment>

<comment>Ah. You mean to say ISIS which is a muslim organization, you mean to say 99.999% of terrorists are muslims, you mean to say 95% of suicide bombers are muslims...so RSS is something like that muslim organization? But the numbers dont add up.</comment>

<comment>so what?  Muslim is only peace Loving Religion on the earth. Not Hindu</comment>

<comment>Yep...only peace loving religion on the earth...I dont want to pick a fight with you else I know you will come and cut my head if I disagree with you just like the ISIS videos are showing. SO yes...I agree with you...Allah O' Akbar.</comment>

<comment>RSS doesn't have any aukaat in front of BJP and Modi.</comment>

<comment>We pity the unduly glorified and pampered top-leadership of Shivsena as well as Congress for their utter ineptinefficiency as well as their brainless and spineless followers unable to revolt towards a change.</comment>

<comment>since last 17 months, all you have done is kept on bitching about congress. Better you all sit in opposition only.</comment>

<comment>Jaitley Ji, your government has resorted to Vandalism against Nepal.India should emphasize that democracy prevails in the current difficulties in Nepal. Constitution was voted by 90% of elected assembly. The borders for new zones were not deliberately designed to keep Madhesis in minorities (Madhesis are not homogeneous groups either, there are dozens ethnicity, languages and casts ), it was just geographically reasonable to do so. Can you accept 30x600 miles strip of plains into one zone (as originally demanded by them, now they have revised demand to 2 zones, constitution provides for 3). and rest of mountainous regions into six zones as demanded by these unelected so called Madhesi leaders who got 12% votes in last constitution assembly elections. With the help of zealots in Indian government they have been blocking vital supplies to 30 million peoples for weeks. Would any democracy in the world accept this type of bully?India should abide by International laws and advise Madhesi friends that their future lies in democratically perusing whatever grievances they may have. Nepal constitution is modern, based on equal rights and forward looking. Otherwise, Nepal will turn into another Kashmir but only many times bigger. When people in Nepal come to conclusion that united, prosperous and powerful India is not in their country's best interest, things can get really unfortunate for people of Nepal, as well as for people of India. What happens if Chinese, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis all come to same conclusion and proceed to destabilize North East India, with an aim to connect Nepal with Bangladesh, only 10 miles separates these two countries ? There would be new country in the NE India bordering Nepal, Bangladesh, China and Myanmar, which may strategically be better for everyone (if India turns into a rogue state under Mr. Modi). Should we all go back to 18th century and try to redraw borders with blood because we can not live with the principle of democracy, equality and mutual respect?</comment>

<comment>Ram Kumar ji. Focus on your own country. They are already trying  for the last 60 years and we are winning hands down. You have to deal with a united India which is the dominant power in the subcontinent and the Indian ocean. China doesn't have a ghost of a chance to replacing us. And whatever advantage they have over us globally will also be only temporary. For all your wishes they aren't even able to make any difference to Pakis and they won't be able to do anything for you. IF we are 70% of the subcontinent's economy today, we are going to be 90% of the subcontinent's total economy tomorrowSO quit day dreaming and accept your harsh reality. We can do what we want. and nobody can stop us.</comment>

<comment>Rape, abduction & forced conversion of 15 year old TukTuki Mandal but none of the media even murmured about it..... Chopping of Prof Joseph Hands.. no outrage... hypocrisy at its best</comment>

<comment>There are worst statements coming out of Owaisi and Azam Khan and Bukhari ad nothing happened. In fact, MIM was part of UPA and now part of TRS in Hyderabad and chairs Hyderabad municipality. Want me to put the statements of Mr. Owaisi here and then you will see Som or Sharma are no match ...in fact, they are like ants when it comes to the statements of Owaisi.</comment>

<comment>I changed one of the articles to reflect truth since these marxist sickular authors can only write anti-Hindu articles.Its moderate face hit, why muslims of India must mark a clear distance from the terrorist fringe..... by Marxist Sickular Bakshaya Bishra Oct 20, 2015 21:56 ISTAn attack a day; if it’s Azam Khan today, shakeel ahmed to'row or Tariq Anwar some other day or it’s some other muslim group tomorrow. It’s not clear whether the activities of the muslim leaders follow an invisible script or a series of random acts with a vague pattern give the goings on the nature of a script. Whatever the case, the trend is hurting the image of muslims in this country.The seriousness of the matter can be gauged from the fact that India got divided by these so called brothers and sisters muslims who fought independence with Hindus Buddhists Christians Sikhs and then the moment they got an opportunity, under Jinnah muslim majority wanted to divide India. Muslim majority didnt stand up to Jinnah and conveyed that they dont want to divide India since they are brothers and sisters of their Hindu Buddhist and others as a family. And then same muslim brothers and sisters butchered their Hindu and Sikh brothers and sisters as if there was no to'row. History repeated again when these so called muslim sunni brothers and sisters butchered and massacred these Hindu and Bengali Shia in 1971 in Bangladesh. These so called muslim brothers and sisters have multiplied by whopping 500% from 4% in 1947 to 20% today which clearly shows their intent to become majority in many areas of India. History has already shown that when muslims grow into majority in any area the first thing they demand is to separate from their Hindu Christian Buddhist brothers and sisters. What is more concerning is that even after 60 innocent Hindu pilgrims returning from Holy Ayodhya were burnt live in a train bogie by terrorist local muslim MLA and terrorist local muslim mullah, not a single muslim leader or en mass Muslim majority condemned it nor they took responsibility and blamed it on electrical short circuit. Media being marxist controlled and in the hands of muslim authors continue to deny the fact.So the sense of urgency is understandable. The fringe through its routine antics has started overshadowing every other important muslim subject in the country – just have a look at the newspaper headlines and the prime time television debates and you get the picture. For a community that divided this country and still stayed here and multiplied from 4% to 20% due to generosity of Hindus, the intolerant groups are proving to be a huge distraction from core matters that are affecting muslim community such as multiple wives, fundamentalism spread by mullah's, sunni killing Shia, and smuggling that is controlled by all muslims. Look at some of the speeches that are hogging that makes Hindu Sikh Buddhist and others nervous of muslims intent as one side they say they are brothers and sisters of them and on the other hand speeches like what Owaisi gave,In August 2007, along with other elected and serving members of his party, Owaisi made death threats against Tasleema Nasreen pledging that the fatwa against her and Salman Rushdie were to be abided by.Owaisi said, "we in Hyderabad want to behead this woman according to the fatwa”Owaisi even threatened ex-PM of India Rao while speaking at a rally in Kurnool in 2011, Owaisi used the derogatory terms Kafirs and Kufrastan to refer to MLAs in Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Assembly. In the same rally he used the Urdu words katil (murderer), darinda (monster), beimaan (dishonest), dhokebaaz (cheat), and chor (thief) for the former Prime Minister of India P V Narasimha Rao. Owaisi said that if Rao had not died, he (Owaisi) would have killed Rao with his own hands.These speeches by muslim leaders like Owaisi only gives an impression that muslims have two faces one face claims to be brothers and sisters of Hindu, Buddhist, Christians, Sikhs and on the other hand the other face is actively working in tandem with Terrorism.By the way, Owaisi’s MIM was part of UPA they supported UPA and they now share power in Hyderabad municipality as well as with TRS government in Telengana. Other muslim leaders maybe loathe to accept this in public, but they cannot be oblivious to the fact these groups have managed to nullify to some extent all the good work done and the sincere intention shown by the muslims in 70 years. The image of the muslim has taken a hit. Worse, the groups are offering a rallying point to the political opposition which still remains divided and scattered after the general election of 2014.Thanks to these groups, the muslim relationship with Hindus Buddhists Sikhs promises to be as turbulent as the monsoon rain. Hindus Buddhists Sikhs Christians are expected to demand answers from muslims on all their terrorist activities, ranging from the terrorist attacks which are all by muslims to their support for hawala operators like Ghulam Ali and Fateh Ali Khan to their support for dreaded terrorist Dawood to what not. The muslim as a bloc has little to do with local developments in Pakistan, but it will still face the music in India.The problem, perhaps,begins with the divergent reading of the division of India in 1947 by different sections of muslims. For the muslims who demanded separation from Hindustan for their homeland but could not afford to move to Pakistan and so stayed here it was a division by Jinnah and others (even though they were part of it) and Jinnah’s call for a break from the Hindu majority Hindustan of the past. For others, who got Pakistan it was a vote for the massacre and butchering of Hindus agenda. The latter are not part of India in a direct way but they have been its biggest supporters, providing it assistance at the ground level in J&K and other parts of India. They are somehow under the impression that they are stakeholders in the daily life of muslims in India too and be sympathetic all their acts of excess by muslims in India.The muslim majority needs to clear that misconception quickly. However, so far it appears a bit confused as to how to go about it. Warnings off and on have not worked. What makes matters worse for it is people like Owaisi and Azam Khan with Bukhari have been offering direct or indirect moral support to the fringe groups by their utterances. Even muslim spokespersons are seen to be siding with terrorism like supporting Afjal Guru or Kasab in television programmes. If muslims has given a thought to the problem, it’s not visible yet.Secular establishment has not accepted Modi as PM, says Taslima Nasrin. Noted Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin, who is currently living in exile in the US, the novelist slammed some of those who she said are guilty of selective outrage. This is the problem with Muslims as a group who claim to be secular in nature yet they want their Islamic agenda to be given special attention in India giving an impression that secularism is only expected from Hindus but not from muslims.</comment>

<comment>I wonder if Mr Jaitley could put to notice some "soundbite champions" among prestitute media like randipan sharma & rajdeep sardesai</comment>

<comment>You are also one of soundbite champion. Obviously no one in BJP is listening to Arun Jaitley.</comment>

<comment>And you are not narad but a namarad</comment>

<comment>finance minister should be talking about the economy. But thanks to sickular enemies and some idiotic friends, he and entire India are talking about less important thingsIt is only in India people expect things like emotional dumba88es. How does "statements" from PM CM HM AM DM ....basically *M solve these problems? Will Aklakh come back if someone makes these statements?

<comment>Really so called N Motwani. So you are telling me that it is also true that Indian Muslims are nothing but Pakistani muslims who are all terrorists and it is Taliban that pulls all the strings. And despite pretending to be patriotic Indian muslims can do nothing about terrorism coz they are powerless. Shame.</comment>

<comment>the media are run by bunch of congressis and communists.  there needs to be a balance in the media, at least a half of them should be hindus.</comment>

<comment>Mr. Jait-LIES hypocrisy = when in opposition justify blocking Parliament. When in power, give sermons about democracy being in danger because of the opposition. When in opposition, lament about economy and rubbishing the global economy being down as a cause for the Indian economy being down. Now, surprise oh surprise, he is going on singing about global factors. Shameless Jait-LIE!!</comment>

<comment>shilpe babes that's life. Let's not be hypocritical. Take you for e.g. Hand on heart have you never used your womanly assets to elbow out competition? :)</comment>

<comment>I think you a spewing venom without basis. The government is formed with the will of the people. People wanted Modi to lead and the wastrels in RS are blocking good things for India</comment>

<comment>LOL @ at Mr. Jait-LIE. His word carry ZERO weight within his own party. Well, not as if the PM's weight carries any weight as is. Keep making statements and allow chaddi bhakts to carry on vandalism and justify it. Open season for vandals and goons and their supporters - governance down the drains and so too the image of the country but who cares. Certainly not Mr. Jait-LIE who is busy sermonising and questioning the judiciary about being unelected, when he himself lost the Lok Sabha elections (what a humiliation) and had a to get through the RS to become the FM - the greatest tragedy for India. No wonder the economy is stuck in quicksand - as Mr. Arun Shourie (oh yes the traitor now since he started speaking the truth) pointed out so succinctly!!</comment>

<comment>I suppose economy in quicksand is better than being looted daily by Robber badra and his team of crooks.</comment>

<comment>Sir, hate politics in India by registered political parties are extremely vandalizes India's image on globe. It is first duty of democratic Government to insure that no one have right to ruin India's image on globe.It should be punishable offense.Govt. should work against this type of activities in multi dimension . 1- case registered under anti-nation activities. 2- provide 100% security to the native public who go against this type of activities. so on ...</comment>

<comment>have you considered directing that to the cm of u.p. whose job it really is?</comment>

<comment>AJ please address your party and its allies on this topic. After that go after the many corrupt members and stop defending them. Finally get elected to parliament with merit not through the back door. </comment>

<comment>Did you even read the whole article. He specifically said BJP president has addressed the party members who made such statements. Why were people like you not complaining when we had unelected Manmohan as PM and before that unelected Manmohan was finance minister. The PM should be elected but should be allowed to pick anybody for the cabinet. </comment>

<comment>MMS was elected in the RS... what nonsense are you talking about</comment>

<comment>So what is your point? Arun Jaitley is also a member of the Rajya Sabha. In fact he was the leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha. Don't you know that the constitution requires members of the cabinet to be members of one of the two houses? Baap re with this level of general knowledge no wonder the Congress party is at 44. </comment>

<comment>Perfect.....Pappu's paid trolls r also Pappu</comment>

<comment>All Indians  should focus on promoting debate for democracy, starting with 'vandalism' at BCCI. After all cricket  is truly competitive and secular activity, and also the most engaging career/game for  Indians, including for some politicians.</comment>

<comment>FM is in BCCI/Thakur is In BCCI/Pawar In BCCI and many other politicians in BCCI.Now it is the question of cricket series with West Muslimstan(Pakistan). Question of conflict of interest. Whether political interest and safety of the nation is first or Cricket interest comes first for these Board Members? People of the country can make out.Media is mum!!!</comment>

<comment>What goes round comes around ! What all was decimated during UPA is now getting life! What all Bharatiyata , the Mughals and british destroyed is coming back! Glory of this country will be restored ! And only a nationalist party like BJP and though Shivasenas maybe hot heads, that kind of balance too is the need of the hour !</comment>

<comment>nough is enough fom the view point of a CHRISTIAN....too much has happened now congress rule shud come....."CHRISTIAN" ko  sab tarf MARO_ MARO hai....!!!.)..</comment>

<comment>As an ATHEIST(how ever peope often mistake me as a CHRISTIAN).......i am of the OPINIONhindu muslamaan christian has no meaning ..in this country...... we all are SAME............Y  BJP has NOT kept even a SINGLE ------CHRISTIAN......in any of the TEAM of its governance...............!!!!all of a SUDDEN(all...rajan mathais,antonys,chackos,samsons have vanished....  "CHRISTIAN" ko MARO_ MARO hai....!!!.)..let BJP be more inclusive and keep a "CHRISTIAN" in its decision making team if possible in minority commision,sensor board,foreign offices......MAY a government where all feel accepted come to POWER.........</comment>

<comment>If you are an atheist then you are lying. In the eyes of atheist there is no such thing as Christian or blah blah. Everyone in Modiji's cabinet is India. Now, you think Hindu Muslamaan Christian are same but Indian first then dont you think you need to keep your atheist mouth shut or is it your back that is blowing hot racist air?</comment>

<comment>"Satan should never quote scriptures" - my dear Jait(liar) !!  It looks pretty artificial and made up !!</comment>

<comment>Enough is enough fom the view point of a CHRISTIAN....too much has happened now congress rule shud come....."CHRISTIAN" ko  sab tarf MARO_ MARO ho gay hai...........!!!!</comment>

<comment>What is this Christian or non-Christian? People like you and Congress divided India. Now, it is time for all Indians not on the basis of color or creed or religion to be dividing India like you are doing. Oh and am I going to see a non-white pope soon? How about a female pope? None? Is it because non-white Christians ko sab tarf maro maro ho gay hai.</comment>

<comment>Jait(liar) - You conveniently forget that the electoral rise of your party was  hinged on sheer Vandalism wherein your own Chief Minister shamefully went against the undertaking given to the Supreme Court to restore status quo at the disputed site. The twin evil traits of Vandalism and hooliganism has greatly benefited in  the meteoric  rise of your party and now through the course of years having acquired a position of prominence,  you can afford to revel in the voice of sanity, a privilege not available to your loony cousin - Shiv Sena.  But it really fools no one as everybody knows that the leopard cannot change its spots and it is proved time and again where all your leaders are voicing their opinion in a conflicting fashion confounding everyone as to what you really  stand for  !?</comment>

<comment>why do u spamming same nonsense so many times , do u get 1 paisa for every spam message here !!!!Rather u can sit in front of a temple and beg right !!!!!</comment>

<comment>Too little too late Mr. Jaitely.</comment>

<comment>Yeah anything bjp does is too little too late :)</comment>

<comment>Yep. Amen to that.</comment>

<comment>I think there is no doubt remaining that BJP leaders are the best orators in the current political environment in the country. And there is also no doubt that they are the most accomplished con-men...less talk and more action would put an end to all this idiocy that is plaguing the country. Interesting to see that here Mr Jaitley says that the BJP president has 'strongly taken up' with the motor mouths in the party but at the same time the so-called motor mouths say they only discussed party matters. So once again no action taken and the idiots are getting ready to spout another round of rubbish. Hilarious to read that at one side BJP is trying to lecture Shiv Sena leaders against vandalism but no action taken against their own MLAs in Kashmir who did the same thing...at least Shiv Sena leaders had the decency to do gundaism outside the assembly building</comment>

<comment>Had he given this advice to his partymen in Gujrat, at least 1500 innocent Indian Muslims, including children, women and aged persons, would have been alive today. Shivsena has protested against Pakistanis.  Why should Jaitley have objection to it ?  His people are killing Muslims over issue of beef and getting loud applause from his top leaders and a so-called  mild reprimand behind closed door.  For Jaitley, staying with the leader of 'most corrupt party' at his residence at Baramati  when government circuit house was available, is a 'civilised mode'.</comment>

<comment>Quit lying hater</comment>

<comment>the bjp govt should take strict actions against all those who think their political elevation will only be through making stupid statement read radical / violent actions. it has to be cut at the source. there are ways to express your opinion but no more will out of line statements be tolerated.</comment>

<comment>See the devil chanting hymns. His government people are those who are responsible for killings and hatred and have shamed India and now he defends them and speaks flowery language. What a cannibal!</comment>

<comment>Quit lying creep,  where government people responsible in killing anyone</comment>

<comment>First you stop 'motor mouths' and color "pichkaaris"</comment>

<comment>ur party MPs are the ones whipping up communal sentimentsfeku and jaitly simply looked the other way becoz it helped them win electionseven now I doubt jaitly's intentions,its like shaitan preaching Vedas.</comment>

<comment>And I doubt your intentions. .</comment>

<comment>Nothing complicated...when it comes to goons, shivsena is a bigger goon than rss, so the little goon preaching love and compromise..:) When the President talked about the tolerance, the rss band wagons went on offensive, but when it comes to hurt their own butt, they extend a olive leaves...:)</comment>

<comment>Couldn't make head or tail of your comment</comment>

<comment>:) ...I was referring Mr.Jetli.....he was sleeping until now and wake up all of a sudden when Mr.Sudeendra kulkarni taste their own bitterness...</comment>

<comment>I think its not about kulkarnee.. he was a thru and thru advani supporter..But Shiv sena in an attempt to remain relevant is going over board.. that too as an ally in the govt... whatever said and done their behaviour is embarrasing to the Mah govt and against the norms of democracy :)</comment>

<comment>Off course yes...but who is following the norms of democracy? I know this is not a right justification...but at times you will have to force to do that...yes, Shivsena feels that they are loosing the grip of 'Maratha rhetoric' and trying to play a more nationalistic patrons role. But I feel it's very much relevant to have a counter-check like shivasena for BJP, after all these thugs started this hate mongering politics. They set the trend of becoming a patriot-the more venom you spit against muslims or Pakistan or the so called secular parties the more patriot you become..:) Let them also enjoy the bit of their venom...</comment>

<comment>well if that makes you happy.. njoy</comment>

<comment>It is only when people feel that many chances have been given for nice talks that people resort to more aggressive methods. If we take Pak, J&K issues, Jaitley must not expect normal reactions from common people who may belong to any political outfit. There is an ideology every outfit follows. When all options on table are done away with , all that remains is aggressiveness. So it is human nature and not some make-up which can be changed by whims and fancies. Instead of criticizing such actions, people like Jaitley who are more mature and decent MUST find reasons for such reaction and work towards sorting them out.</comment>

<comment>Arun Jaitley has become sickular, 10 trillion hindus have been killed by mughals, cannot have civilized debates now.</comment>

<comment>Lovely coping...tit for tat...:)</comment>

<comment>So why don't you return the Taj Mahal to a Muslim country? Are you spineless? C'mon do it if you have even a bit of self respect! It was built by the Mughals and you have no right on it!</comment>

<comment>Its foundation is a Shiva temple! All major monuments Mughals made are over destroyed temple sites ! Indian history is not a mystery ! All things go in a cycle! Simple!</comment>

<comment>Have You ever heard of a word called sarcasm ?Mr collapsing world is a  hater like you</comment>

<comment>hahahahh...you understand it..:) btwn, how come he is a hater dude..?:)</comment>

<comment>same way every BJP supporter is a bhakt :)Warning : I am "bhakt" :)</comment>

<comment>No..i nevr say all bjp supporter is a bhakt...only those who blindly support and endorse whatever bjp do is a bhakt in my view...:)</comment>

<comment>hmm..right approach</comment>

<comment>World has seen great debates in kashmir assembly and also on December 6 , 1992 near Babri masjid .. There can be many ocassions we have seen BJP indulging meaningful debates like Jaitely is preaching now :)</comment>

<comment>India was divided into two nations.1 Muslimstan West(Pakistan) and Muslimstan East(Bangladesh now). Still those not satisfied with division into two parts they wanted to create one more that is Separatiststan(Kashmir) and that is mini West Muslimstan(Jammu & Kashmir) which is under the direct influence of West Muslimstan.For long term agenda the political tool is " secularism". If Indians are real human beings they should not tolerate things put them to indignation and to outrage.Time has come to say what makes Indians unhappy and furious.It can be possible to engage if other person is sincere and sane.Pakistan is not.</comment>

<comment>Yes BJP must not be apologetic ! This was supposed to happen !</comment>
