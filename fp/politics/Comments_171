<comment>I fear, Shiv Sena is being misguided, and going to a point of no return........Even Balasaheb wont advocate this ruthless obstinacy.......</comment>

<comment>Scene 2: Balasaheb Thackeray bows to Modi (after Modi bows to him). A usual normal gesture.and FP just cant stop being a prezztitute</comment>

<comment>So what? It is samskar to bow in front of elders.</comment>

<comment>The NDA is becoming liability for the BJP as much as loudmouths are. Hope to see the day they can finally stop fearing casting off the Shiv Sena, Akali Dal and those castemen like Paswan and Manjhi. Regional politics is the bane of India, with a rare exception like CBN</comment>

<comment>Well Modi has not forgotten BT..Udhav has!!! By trying to create problems for BJP he is making a fool of himself!SS is corrupt but so is NCP. BJP has no choice. They have to align with either to form the government and do some work!</comment>

<comment>There is an old saying in Malayalam which roughly translates "if the father rides on an elephant for a long time the son won't get the mark on his bum. Uddhav Thackreay is thinking is that he is the equivalent to Bal Thackeray which is a wishful thinking.  It is like Rahul Gandhi thinking that he is like his father, grand mother and great grand father. The politics of the country has changed and Uddhav T cannot get the same support from Marathi manoos in Mumbai at the same level as his father. It is better for SS to stop the hate and disruptive politics and be a part of India's mainstream politics. When Bal T started out Mumbai was the only place where people go for employment. This has changed and Uddhav cannot live on the past success of SS.</comment>
