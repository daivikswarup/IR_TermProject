<comment>hey.. goon lawyers... what about 'goon' students? oh wait..they are friends of 'doon' boys..</comment>

<comment>What is happening to this country ...... Under congress it was only corruption but under BJP ...this is just sick!!</comment>

<comment>we have better important national news - Maharashtra Police reveals JNU, DU's dark Maoist secret, any takers you presst1tutes  !!!</comment>

<comment>Fully shamed on DELHI police. They are main anti national rather then kanhaiya.Why those lawyer goons are roaming freely in Delhi.What Rajnath and Modi doing??? Pure Jangal raj in Delhi due to center</comment>

<comment>Because they want to appear heroic in catching a student whose studies include asking questions. They are not able to catch many thieves and robbers leave alone terrorists. Now as if arresting  Umar is a very big deal!!! When they did not have anything to perform they show to people with these silly antics.</comment>

<comment>Did Delhi Police give anti-India speech?Did they organize any anti-India meetingsDid they support any terrorist?Dont compare anything to Hate India speeches.....India First...Only then comes Political/Student/castes/religion issues</comment>

<comment>'India First...Only then comes Political/Student/castes/religion issues',tell this to Subramanian Swamy, he is wasting time on divisive issue of religious structure, thus promoting communal disharmony,a kind of anit-national activity which cannot be overlookedâ€¢I</comment>

<comment>Today we are in a open world, we can travel /live in 80% of the countries we like. If anyone dont like their mother India why crying. You can apply for citizenship of the country we like and settle.   Dont try to bash me, I dont want anyone to leave India but if it cause hate to my mother land everyone can use their own right.</comment>

<comment>Dear media, everywhere I see, the whole issue has been just about the Patiala house incident for you guys. I sincerely wish you would devote as much time and energy into investigating what happened at JNU as well. Yes, the lawyers were wrong, but were the students completely in the right? Why not show both sides with equal representation?</comment>

<comment>Agree with you completely, it should be unbias reporting of what is happening in the country.</comment>

<comment>u have the police chief saying the onus is on the accused to prove he is innocent....doesnt our rule of land say INNOCENT until proven guilty......sisnt that what the bhakt sa also say whenver their leaders are accused of anything</comment>

<comment>Dont your argument look like taking advantage of flaws in law, also we can tolerate anything but not hate against our Mother India</comment>

<comment>I share your views but what if someone is falsely accused? doesnt everyone deserve a fair trial? When one is found guilty in a fair court then they deserve the punishment as per our laws - Yakub Memon and A Guru got what they deserved after a fair trial.What if these people would have killed someone accused of this crime and then found out he was framed and innocent - what would you do then?</comment>

<comment>oh ...who u are sir...the sole rights to national tag?</comment>

<comment>Vote for Kaniaya Kumar as PM.Army Generals beat a retreat. You call talk sedition [based on a colonial law]. Talk does not harm but action does. What do you call anti-national activities of Jats. What do you call anti-national parliament and constitution. You did nothing when VP Singh made the constitution anti National. You see the effect today and what will they say against Modi who wants to be another VP SIngh. I strongly suspect that Modi and rajnath SIngh want to sell their supporters and bring in private sector reservations.Army Genrals what did you do when emergency was imposed an dsocialism[legal robbery] was introduced into constituion under orders from KGB?</comment>

<comment>AKA that sold out loser on TV BHAKSHI!!</comment>

<comment>Beautifully said. People are using less of their brain and more of brawn these days.</comment>

<comment>The lawyers should be arrested. But this Kanhaiya guy must learn his lessons for a lifetime. To speak against Indians in India or even participate in protests by ppl like Umar Khalid is a recipe for disaster. No second thoughts on that for sure.</comment>

<comment>are you dumb or you are you just stupid today? Dint you see the morphed videos? He was framed. Kanhaiya was shouting slogans( which he has every right to do) about something else! these bjp PIGS morphed the videos and pics and started to circulate it with their Media friends..</comment>

<comment>Agreed, if not punished it will set a bad example..Kanhaiya if proved guilty should be punished harshly.No other students should dare to throw hate against our Mother India</comment>

<comment>Patiala house mayhem is a handy diversion.  JNU treason will be conveneintly hidden behind this.  For all what India's journalism is worth for this, any third grade prostitution in any part of this earth is nobler, healthier and sacrosanct for their democracies. Huh.</comment>

<comment>Why to be patriotic or proud for a country where some third grade lawyers can take law in their hands so brazenly, felicited  and openly boast about it in the capital?</comment>

<comment>The JNU incident will be a good lesson for both the sides. For JNU, next time someone thinks of shouting anti-India slogans, they will think twice. For government, next time they try to suppress dissent by force, they will think twice. If either of these does not happen, they will fade away into history!</comment>

<comment>Earlier there used to be films like Goonda MLA, Vardi Wala Goonda etc.Now we have Goonda Sarkar in reality. Shame on Modi Sarkar.A country which due to its convictions has given  even terrorist Kasab a fare trial now has been talibanasied by RSS to such level. RSS is basically group of mob lyncher and rioters so you cannot aspect more from themAs for Mr. Bassi he has proved that those making films like Vardi Wala Goonda were drawing from real life.</comment>

<comment>I can't believe these lawyers can.stoop down to this level.These people are not really lawyers.</comment>

<comment>The BJP govt will be awarding the lawyers Bharat Ratna for services to the nation. A perfect strategy to have the leftist scum pissing in their pants (literally). Rule of law is stupid anyway. Who needs police (except to standby and cheer the heroes on) and Judges and law when we can just beat up all the undesirables? Faster and more efficient this way. In fact make leftist-beating legal and stop burdening these heroes with minor legal troubles.</comment>

<comment>Uhm... how about BJP's love affair with PDP that openly calls Afzal as a martyr? Shouldn't ba(l)die Amit Shah be booked under treason for officiating that marriage? Which is besides the... minor... legal point that there is not a shred of evidence that Kanhaiya said anything even remotely as insane as BJP's partner!</comment>

<comment>Its For the Greater Good.</comment>

<comment>Just because you capitalize "G"reater "G"ood doesnt make a fking hypocrisy go away. If Kanhaiya is bashed by BJP goons, then so should the kingpin of goons, Modi.</comment>

<comment>Poe's law?</comment>

<comment>Haha.. Good one! I have come to expect the most ridiculous of comments from bhakts that they no longer sound 'too ridiculous to be real' :D</comment>

<comment>FYI.. For the Greater Good  - Grindelwald.</comment>
