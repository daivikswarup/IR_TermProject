<comment>President of India, Supreme court Judges Election commission , let me judge you. Nuremburg trial said to Nazis, why did you not commit suicide, when they took the defense that they were just doing their duty.I say soul of post 1947 India is murder of INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS of  merit by reservation policy + and murder of property rights by socialism. Anyone volunteering to commit suicide as they are serving a fake democracy and an ocholocracy [mob rule]?  Just voting does not make a democracy - protection of Individual rights [the smallest minority rights]makes a country democratic and free.</comment>

<comment>What is more important than his being Anti national is Kanhiyah is not an Individual [rather he is ANTI INDIVIDUAL] - he is a CPI worker, who was powerful enough to Impose emergency along with Indira Gandhi. He will protest Afzal Guru execuation but he will not say a word on murder of merit an Indiviudual right. Rather he wants people themselves to murder Individual rights so that he can impose his single party collective dictatorship==================================================================================Rohit Vemula was also a goon who assaulted ABVP person. They are from the ruling gang [as subset of population]. They are pro-reservation. Perhaps Rohit vemula recognized the emptiness of his life and committed suicide.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------When a person scores above 94% and another gets same seat for 49% in an EXAMINATION when the examiners dont know the examinees then merit does not exist because it has been murdered. A person who was murdered did exist. So also merit.That is the argument of relative morality of Mixed economy, a fascist economy - because measure and morals is a product of ones upbringing they dont exist. What is only moral is what the Constitution and mafia politicians laws state.Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim’s gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of money taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials and mafia politicians.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, but that it cannot be used honestly.Why does not the state allot a seat strictly on merit and snatch it away OPENLY?</comment>

<comment>They really messed up with the whole issue. Inexperience shows.</comment>

<comment>Another appeasement advocate trying to blame nationalists and patriots for the treachery of Kashmiri separatists. There's no place for part-time Indians - they should be kicked out of the country, and live their Azadi dreams elsewhere.Congis only want to keep Azadi types alive and kicking in order to ensure that nation says weak and precariously teetering. When everbody else is teetering, then Congress feels strong and secure.</comment>

<comment>And what do you mean "By using 'azadi' slogans to target the left," . It was the left wich was shouting the slogans. Do you want India to just bow our heads in front of your sedition and lose our country? You people are pathetic.</comment>

<comment>Maybe the terror incident in Kashmir was done by the 10 communist students who are absconding. They after all shouted that they wil fight against India and they are doing it.</comment>

<comment>The terror attacks in Kashmir proved that the slogans were not mere words but were indeed words to incite violence against the state. Communists should be banned</comment>

<comment>What kind of sick logic is this. It is the azadi slogans of the Communist leaders children in JNU and their shamefull support by Rahul, D Raja, Kejri and Yechuri which has boosted azadi sentiment in Kashmir. Not only should kanaiya not ley out but everyone including Rahul Gandhi should be charged with inciting war against the state.</comment>

<comment>A new theory has to be built up to explain why some Indians still stick to communism/socialism when the system has been SHOWN to produce hyperinflation genocide and single party slavery. Let us take the help of Freud----------------------------------------------------------------------------------What if some Indians want to screww mother and Indians want to screww motherland?? Is this the reason why Indian men have difficulty in have girl friends and India does not want to get involved in wars outside India, and is deeply INWARD looking?Sigmund Freud father of psychoanalysis said "mother worship" when asked to define India. Continuing this analysis::Arnab Goswami goes slightly wrong when he says even left loves India. Love non-mediated by religion turns motherly love to love for female. That is why Left is intent of screwwing India. That love is sexual love for mother, motherland. Jats and Kapus in Andhra Pradesh[who have burnt a train] are demanding reservation. That is again immoral sexual love for motherland.Such effect of predatory sexual love for motherland [nothing wrong with motherly love]has even led to murder of motherland in history as following shows..Dahir was BRAHMIN King in Sindh. By enlisting the support of local tribes (such as the Jats, Meds and Bhuttos) and Buddhist rulers of Nerun, Bajhra, Kaka Kolak and Siwistan as infantry to his predominantly-mounted army, Muhammad bin Qasim defeated Dahir and captured his eastern territories for the Umayyad Caliphate.Dahir then tried to prevent Qasim from crossing the Indus River, moving his forces to its eastern banks. Eventually, however, Qasim crossed and defeated forces at Jitor led by Jaisiah (Dahir's son). Qasim fought Dahir at Raor (near modern Nawabshah) in 712, killing him; Dahir's wife immolated herself (with other women in her household) in accordance with the Hindu tradition of Jauhar.=========================================================Academicians have swallowed a fascist lie spread by media that India is a democracy.What a Joke! What about the assault on Individual right of merit by reservation policy? In which country are cities brought to a halt by bandhs? Media should first say India was a Ocholocracy[mob rule].India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] not a democracy. Free speech can be explosive unless it is a part of movement to uproot the Ocholocracy. In a Ocholocracy INDIVIDUAL rights are murdered by definition with help of state. Examples of murder of INDIVIDUAL right are reservation policy which is murder of merit, an INDIVIDUAL right and socialism(by definition legal robbery) which is murder property right, another INDIVIDUAL right.Why are Indians not trusted with free gun laws as in USA? Answer to this simple question demolishes free speech argument.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why were leftists associated with secessionists? The culture of socialist legal robbery is manifesting itself as secessionism - because the socialists may have realized it is impossible to come to an understanding on who the supreme dictator should be and they want to establish numerous single part dictatorships over fragments of country. Socialism has to lead to single party dictatorships over fragments of country.Adam Smith, the father of economics, says in economics Man Proposes and God Disposes. If every body in a nation become do-gooders -- God disposes -- and we will have hell on earth. if man proposes to be selfish -- God again disposes -- and we will have prosperity and peace.Giving rational explanation of God, the elder do-gooders , MK Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Ambedkar etc forgot that a strong socialist state is required to do good. And it will demand its pound of flesh closest to the heart – rampant corruption. A strong state emerges in an environment of shortages – to distribute scant resources. Any socialist state will NOT destroy the reason for its existence. 24 hour water supply will reduce water required to be released by 30%. No Government Engineer in India will accept this. Scarcity, distress is required for the reason for its existence. If no scarcity exists it will manufacture it. Mysore had water scarcity even though it had KRS dam beside it. It is a question of power. A society can either have equality or freedom but never both. Why? To enforce equality a strong and intrusive state is required. Stateism is against Individualism and kills freedom.Since 1947, the political parties, government need not care as they have attained emancipation from democracy -- principally by the tool of reservation policy, where vote banks are formed. And they will vote according to predictable patterns whatever the rulers do or don't do. In other words India has become a Fascist state[socialism is a necessary component of it --Nazi means National Socialist]by the vehicle of reservation policy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just voting does not make India democracy. Protection of rights of the smallest minority the INDIVIDUAL MAKES A SYSTEM DEMOCRATIC. The problem is, India is an Ocholocracy[mob rule] where Individual rights are murdered[example is murder of merit an Individual right by reservation policy and property rights by socialism. Socialism is legal robbery.A period of good dictatorship may be required to cure Indians of disease of bad democracy, due to the infection of socialism or legal robbery. Otherwise bad democracy can kill in millions like in Cambodia under Pol Pot. Ocholocracy looks like democracy but it is not. Just look at immorality of Indians- Laloo the reason for largest migration of Biharis from Bihar was reelected.-----------------------------------------------------------It is logically wrong to allow communist parties to function in a multi party democracy as they are for single party dictatorship - they openly state it! Ban communist parties===================================================Now BJP/RSS should bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=============================================</comment>

<comment>I guess this is Sandipan Sharma writing under another name. Same type of cr*p.</comment>

<comment>Army will take care of Kashmir. The intellectuals and liberals should not destroy India from within. Anti nationalism should have no sympathy.</comment>

<comment>End your line with Jai Hind Sir. don't behave like anti national. Jai Hind.</comment>

<comment>Jay Hind! Harry om! Lol For those NRI bhakts!</comment>

<comment>Army is a blunt force tool, not a surgical tool that can be used delicately on our own population. The use of army and its side-effects has created a lot of resentment in the citizens which foreign forces then seek to exploit.The right thing to do is to integrate the Kashmiri youth into the Indian mainstream with opportunities for economic and professional development. But when we give them quotas and get them to our universities, some silly people create a hullaballoo and scare them off by charging them with sedition for events like cheering for some team or some sloganeering. Somehow the hardliners manage to kick a self-goal that sets the integration process back by decades.National Integration is brought about by winning over hearts, not with force. A few slogans do not damage the nation, but this overreaction damages the nation. Let us show them why they should integrate into India. Not beat them into doing so.</comment>

<comment>How do these journos just jump to conclusions that a large or even a significant part of Indians support JNU or are against the govt? I wish they do some real investigative work or at least take a proper poll of a sample of Indians before they jump to such conclusions. High decibels produced in rallies meant to produce high decibels doesn't prove that the rally represents the majority.</comment>

<comment>David you are a bigger bird brain than I thought. So now the government should not go after Omar. Why? Because he is from minority. That is your logic. That's the plan B. As if plan A and B were devised to be rolled out sequentially ...My dear birdy- give your little brain some rest. Let the law take its course. Arm chair commies, imperialist stooges, and jholawalas - take it easy. Please. Your bore us. </comment>

<comment>Has to be a firstpost article. I'm yet to come across any article of fp which is in sync with majority national thinking. I doubt if FP editors are on Chinese or ISI funding?</comment>

<comment>I don't know which middle class India is supporting Kanhaiya. Even in Delhi which has turned towards AAP, people are supporting the police action against him. Even in Delhi Metro, one can see angry reactions to what happened at JNU.</comment>

<comment>Muslim historian Firishta [full name Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah, born in 1560 and died in 1620], the author of the Tarikh-i Firishta and the Gulshan-i Ibrahim, was the first to give an idea to the medieval bloodbath that was India during Muslim rule, when he declared that over 400 million Hindus got slaughtered during Muslim invasion and occupation of India. Survivors got enslaved and castrated. India’s population is said to have been around 600 million at the time of Muslim invasion. By the mid 1500’s the Hindu population was 200 million.By the time the British arrived to the shores of India and after centuries of Islamic law ruling India, the Hindu population was not behaving like their normal self; they were behaving like Muslims. There are many witness reports from the British archives of horrendous Hindu incidents that were shocking in cruelty to the British – and they therefore sometimes referred to the people as “savages”. Yes, anyone who gets contaminated by the association with Islamic ‘culture’ truly gets tainted and savaged. That is exactly why it is so detrimental and dangerous.Today, like other cultures with a soul massacred by Islam, India is not truly a Hindu nation. India is a shadow of Islam, a Hindufied version of Islam, where every human atrocity has been emulated and adopted into a culture previously alien to such brutality. And in association with it’s foreign mohamedan pest, these Islamic habits have become adopted and accepted as a “normal” part of Indian culture. But if we look at pre-Islamic Indian culture it was a in general a benevolent culture of knowledge and learning, much more so than it is today.From the time of the Umayyad Dynasty (711AD) to  the last Mughal, Bahadur Shah Zafar (1858), so widely praised as great leaders by Indian historians themselves, entire cities were burnt down and the populations massacred, with hundreds of thousands killed in every campaign, and similar numbers deported as slaves. Every new invader made (often literally) his hills of Hindus skulls. Thus, the conquest of Afghanistan in the year 1000 was followed by the annihilation of the Hindu population; the region is still called the Hindu Kush, i.e. “Hindu slaughter.” Time for Hindus/ Sikhs to rise up and balance the equation. No Hindu / Sikh has the right to rest till that is achieved.</comment>

<comment>You are factually incorrect. Many parts of India apart from Hindi/ Urdu heartland was never conquered - example is Kerala---------------------------------------------Dahir was BRAHMIN King in Sindh. By enlisting the support of local tribes (such as the Jats, Meds and Bhuttos) and Buddhist rulers of Nerun, Bajhra, Kaka Kolak and Siwistan as infantry to his predominantly-mounted army, Muhammad bin Qasim defeated Dahir and captured his eastern territories for the Umayyad Caliphate.Dahir then tried to prevent Qasim from crossing the Indus River, moving his forces to its eastern banks.

Qasim fought Dahir at Raor (near modern Nawabshah) in 712, killing him; Dahir's wife immolated herself (with other women in her household) in accordance with the Hindu tradition of Jauhar.</comment>

<comment>"In 1971, Muslims murdered 2.4 million Hindus and raped 200,000 Hindu women’" These are not my facts as you put it. Read Swami Vivekananda's write on Muslim rule of India and read and more recently the killings of Hindus in 1971. I suspect you are a muslim, possibly living in Hindustan so your defense of Muslims is understandable. But we will have a muslim free Hindustan sooner than later. Show no mercy to these killers.</comment>

<comment>I only contested a limited point - it was not entire India, not entirely. Vivekanada is wrong  stricltly according to ideas in supporting socialism, which is legal robbery ["half a loaf is better than no no loaf at all"].. It allowed rebirth of ancient evil of muslim invasions. Look at USA on how it is doing so well without socialism.Adam Smith, the father of economics, says in economics Man Proposes and God Disposes. If every body in a nation become do-gooders -- God disposes -- and we will have hell on earth. if man proposes to be selfish -- God again disposes -- and we will have prosperity and peace.Giving rational explanation of God, the elder do-gooders , MK Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Ambedkar etc forgot that a strong socialist state is required to do good.

<comment>By ethnically cleansing Kashmiri Pandits, who are the actual natives of Kashmir and then settling there, what moral right do they have in asking for a plebiscite? How can they even claim Kashmir to be theirs?Kashmir belongs to India, whether these Muslims agree with it or not.Does tolerance mean allowing the truth to be suppressed?</comment>

<comment>Kashmiri Pandits asserted that Kashmir is an integral part of India.They were thrown away by the Afzals for their assertion with the help of Pakistan.India was watching it without taking any action against Pakistan.Point is those Kashmiri Pandits who wanted to uphold Constitution in minority dominated Kashmir have not been protected by the same  constitution. On the contrary JNU students, secualrists and left radicals support Afzal Gurus and Pakistan by shouting anti India slogans.This is not right to dissent but an act of disrespecting the nation.There could be same fate as in Kashmir Valley for the majoirty community in places where minorities presence are substantialin other parts of the country.  India's inaction after the assault of Kashmiri Pandits in the valley emboldened Pakistan and various Islamic outfits in Pakistan penetrated to India by terrorism and through other channels threatening the safety and security of the people especially Hindus. On paper we claim that Kashmir and PoK are integral part of our country. But actually both are controlled by Pakistan in reality. Indirectly Jammu and Ladakh are also under their control even though democratically elected government is there in J&K Political class of no other country would have allowed such situation  to arise ( because of their patriotism). Enitire money is spent by India on Kashmir but the fruits of it enjoyed by some other country besides allowing the enemies throwing  away natives of the land for religious reasons (but we call them secular ironically) and doing nothing on it. Pakistan and political parties in Kashmir are mocking at our Constitution.</comment>

<comment>So what do you think should be done?What part of our constitution allows our govt. to silently watch the atrocities committed on Kashmiri Pandits?What needs to be amended and how can the Pandits be rehabilitated and claim their rightful place?Also do you really think we need a big wall near Bangladesh border, to prevent illegal migrants?How to send back the already existing illegal migrants? There is no shoot at sight order near these boundaries, so these Bangla beggars are taking our govt. for granted. The boundaries are so weakly defined there. Even, Mamata Banerjee is asking for indian citizenship for these people who have come in there ILLEGALLY. How do you think that Govt. of India can intervene in this matter and put an end to this problem?We need solutions to these problems. Where are they discussed? Is there any official body of the Govt. of India which takes care of these issues, i.e. concerning issues of national security?</comment>

<comment>Drastic action need to be taken in Kashmir the way drastic action action was taken to throw away Kashmiri Pandits by Pakis with the help of Afzal Gurus and resettle them.Once this level playing done then let dialogue process start if need be.Was there any dialogue for thowing away Kashmiri Pandits from the valley? Then why we should harp on  dialogue with them?  As regards Bangaldesh illegal immigration what to say. Ask Left Government which was in power for more than 3 decades in WB and other secular governments in North East. Terrible secuirty unconsciousness and their idea of India seems to have led to this present situation.Only security agencies can give soltion.</comment>

<comment>Kashmir even can`t be dream for independence. Even if it made independent, how could mange to survive even a day. Even big countries could not stand extremism and terrorism. It will be in chaos, blood. If it becomes decisive in choosing nation which will show peace, then present tough measures by security establishment would end. Our nations diversity can never be wiped-out. We need to live in peaceful co-existence without any intolerance and discrimination and concentrate on problems which improve our lives.</comment>

<comment>The nation is for the people, not to collect land at the cost of lives. Let us do what is best for the people of that place rather than have people in Delhi and Mumbai decide their life. That is the way for a peaceful integrated nation.</comment>

<comment>Kasmir is not just for the muslims, there lives Hindus as well and host of other people from different religion, what about those people, where would they go, they want to live in Kasmir and are proud to be an Indian..then we will put them in a situation to decide between India and Kashmir, and i know that you would not like to talk about the exodus of Kasmiri Hindus...the fact is Kahshmir was, is and will be a part of India...</comment>

<comment>What do you suggest than, it is easier to say your point and then not saying it, let say if India agrees for an Independent Kashmir, would Kashmir be able to handle itself against pakistan, it would be much easier for pakistan to have access to that country, and the chances are high that it will use it's land for nefarious activity against India, what do we do then in that case, even now in our part of Kashmir, intelligencia suggest that the militancy is quite high and that these guys engage with pakistan and as a result we see guys like afzal guru, pakistan provides them with arms and explosives to be used against India...don't come here and tell me that AFSPA resulted in Militancy, what we need to remember is, that it was militancy that resulted in AFSPA...</comment>

<comment>This convert is perhaps realizing that he and his fellow pressitutes, may have gone just a little  too far, in chasing TRP ratings and supporting anti Hindustan forces.The damage is done.</comment>

<comment>David Devadas is partially right in this article.  He is right that the majority of Indians are not against the government for being tough with anti nationals.He is wrong when he laboriously tried to convince the readers that the JNU itself is against the government's action in arresting Kanaiah.Left has no liberal attitude; the author should know that being a sympathiser himself.  They are absolutely stern with their principles and rigid with their political pogroms and have no liberal in their thinking.  They do not believe in freedom of speech when it goes against their principles and pogroms.  The mass killing they conduct wherever they are in influence is the indication of this rigidity and dislike of their freedom of choice.The game is up for those anti nationals masquerading as students and the reach of law will go as far as to their Masters.</comment>

<comment>The nation is strong enough to defend its ideals against extreme Left or extreme Right as well. Calling a huge chunk of Indian people "anti-national" is senseless. People make up the nation.</comment>

<comment>Huge chunk? All those involved in anti national sloganeering are anti nationals.  Your dislike for the ruling party is something but siding with anti national is something that cannot be condoned.India has been a soft towards anti nationals so far. It is time that India gets tough with anti national activities as no nation can survive the disintegration from within.JNU students, all those who participated in anti national activities within its campus, are anti nationals.JNU students or Jadvpur do not represent even a particle of of Indian population to call them even a chunk.The history of Jadvapur is well known to all.  The JNU premises was always used by the leftists to create an invasion within by pretending to be the representative population of young  and intellectual.Sorry man, you need to go back to history and read more to understand the going ons.You cannot call the struggle against the anti nationals as senseless.</comment>

<comment>Very nicely written article. Those who stood with JNU wanted to give a simple message: the tradition of free thinking, that has been prevalent in our universities must be protected at all cost.</comment>

<comment>Free thinking .. in JNU?! LOL. JNU may be having the least amount of original free thinking in its name !!</comment>

<comment>Mr author you are wrong, you yourself and others with that view are to blame for emboldening Kashmiri secessionists, in the UK if this happened the government would beat the crap out of these idiots and mullahs and not let them have a voice to prevent terrorists being emboldened. But you have contributed to their power and may one day suffer under Muslim rule, either that or your children will - and they will have to thank you for their women wearing burkas.</comment>

<comment>Author says..."They think the upsurge of middle class opposition to the arrest of JNU Students Union President Kanhaiya Kumar actually signifies support for them"....middle class supports the action against these anti nationals!!!!what is author thinking???</comment>

<comment>So far what's clear is that there were definately Anti-India slogan shouting, but what's not clear as of now, who shouted the slogans, for a moment if we assume that Kanhaiya was not involved in the anti-india sloganeering, However, we have to understand that he was responsible for that event, so whatever happened in that event was the responsibility that Kanhaiya has to bear, how can he let a bunch of people to high jack an event that he requested for to condemn the execution of "Afzal guru", to let them shout anti-india slogans, there is no evidence that he tried to pacify those protestors, he was party to an incident which was taking place under his watch, can we also assume that he on purpose allowed these "Anti-India sloganeering group" to use platform requested by kanhiaya to say anti-indian things...</comment>

<comment>Kanhaiya is not an anti-national, he is a patriot who has been framed by the local ABVP guys. Yes, all middle-class people who have an iota of intelligence will support Kanhaiya as the facts of the case become clearer. Let's remain skeptical, of both sides. Don't get fooled by the lies being fed to you.</comment>

<comment>He is not thinking, he is lying thru his teeth. Hallmark of a bankrupt leftist. </comment>

<comment>I like one thing about Social media.. Any useless freeloader commie can wake after having a binge on govt money and start giving sweeping statements which he could have never got published in anews paper..I could read only two paras... In the second para he says middle class has supported jnu commies... Kahan hai bhaiya support .. Aj tum kahin bhi market main jao.. Students ko batane main sharam aati hai ki wo jnu se hain..Iyne jute pad rahe hain jnu walon ko...But I think sab papi pet ka sawal hai...Ganda hai par dhanda hai ye...Kuch to chapna padega.. Nahin to daru ke paise kahan se milenge...(kyunki khana to sarkari kharche par badiya chalta hai jnu main)</comment>

<comment>You misunderstood - he meant 'middle' class, i.e. Eunuchs like him !</comment>

<comment>Well said....these commie stooges wants us to believe that JNU anti nationals has got support of middle class!!!! its exactly the opposite...these commies filths have lost whatevenr little support they had in india after this...</comment>

<comment>Guys.. These commies and MSM are trying to confuse everyone.. Earlier they tried Hindu muslim Thatbdid not work they tried upper caste lower casteThen they tried anti bjp and anti govtThen they said one mla has beaten up their supporter completely hiding the fact that they were provoked... Just be careful of these free loaders....And don't let the original issue of raising anti India slogan be put on the back burner...Let's keep the debate alive and force them to answer some questions...Jai hind...</comment>

<comment>Let the left parties not talk about any civil liberties.  The way they tried to suppress  the opposition in the states of Kerala and Bengal and still they are doing in Kerala by killing RSS workers reflects their policy and clear intentions.  The so called leaders like Sitaram Yechuri, D Raja, Brinda Karat never opened their mouths on the brutal killing of RSS worker in Kannur.</comment>

<comment>these commies scums are disgrace to india....</comment>

<comment>Dreams of kasmir are ridiculous as they are locked between india,china and pakistan.All countries will not allow the kashmir peace.Now, ,more kashmiris are been killed by kashmiris than anyone else.Muslim majority kashmir is losing on every front due to bloodied legacy of failed pakistani nation to acquire it by force.</comment>

<comment>Kashmir is not only about the Muslim population.. What about the ethnic cleansing carried out of kashmiri pandits.. That none of these free loader commie dare speak about...because fir victim ka rona kaise roenge...</comment>

<comment>CPI(M)’s ‘civil rights’ are for JNU students: RSS workers? Sorry, they deserve to dieFeb 20, 2016 12:21 ISTCPI(M)’s ‘civil rights’ are for JNU students: RSS workers? Sorry, they deserve to die60 0  0 AABy Srinivasa PrasadEven as CPM leaders were busy crusading for the rights of JNU students in Delhi, a bunch of the party's thugs hacked to death an RSS worker at Kannur in Kerala on Monday.That the CPM's fight for civil rights is limited to Left sympathisers and India-baiters is nowhere as clear as it is in the northern Kerala, where the party's workers kill RSS-BJP supporters with amazing regularity.The Sangh Parivar has, of course, never been found wanting in matching brutality with brutality in the region that has come to be known as Kerala's "killing fields”.Kannur residents are bracing themselves for another bout of Sicilian-type vendetta that often sparks a chain of savage killings. The proximity of elections, just three months away, only keeps the nerves on edge.Monday's murder of the 27-year-old PV Sujith was the latest in serial killings that have intermittently rocked Kannur for four decades. On Monday night a gang of assailants, whom the police later arrested and identified as CPM workers, stormed into Sujith's house in Aroli and attacked him with sticks and knives before his old parents and a younger brother.Sujith's crime? He had vigorously campaigned for the BJP in the recent local body elections in Aroli and the party had polled a substantial number of votes. Intolerance for political adversaries has been the motive in all CPM's killings in Kannur which began some 40 years ago when the RSS began to flex its own political muscles there.Article XI, Section (k) of the CPM's constitution asks its members "to defend the Party and uphold its cause against the onslaught of the enemies of the Party, the working class and the country.”The loyal party cadres find that the easiest way to do it is to bludgeon all such "enemies” to instant death.The RSS would like us to believe that it was the killing of its mukhyashikshak Vadikkal Ramakrishnan by the communists in 1968 that started it all. The CPM says it's rubbish. The party claims that its heroic efforts to protect Muslims in the Hindu-Muslim riots in Thalassery in 1971 had left the RSS in a vengeful mood. Whoever or whatever sparked it, the killings continue unabated.Just as Indiana Jones told "Panama Hat” in 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' that the world was "too small” for the two of them, the CPM and the RSS seem to tell each other that Kannur is too tiny a place to have both of them. One must annihilate the other.And like cameos in films, members of the Congress and the Muslim League occasionally pop up, beating up a Marxist here or lynching a Marxist there. But it's the CPM and the RSS-BJP that are the key players in Kerala's blood sport. And by all accounts, the CPM is the current champion.For the CPM, the hammer and sickle are not just part of its election symbol. They are potential tools of murder. Swords, axes, knives come in handy for both sides. Crude bombs, made at homes with the same ease as appams and mutta curry, are a common feature.The CPM has many "party villages”-a euphemism for KGB-style "safe houses” where perpetrators of mayhem can hide. Over time, the BJP too followed suit with its own "party villages”. Outsiders can enter such places only with dire consequences, which may include a one-way ticket to hell.Like the KGB, Kerala's CPM has zero tolerance for defectors. In a murder that shook the state in 2012, CPM workers killed TP Chandrasekharan, who had broken away from the party and launched his own outfit, by hacking his face with knives beyond recognition.The killings are always savage. Like Sujith of RSS last week, KV Sudeesh of SFI was hacked to death in 1994 in front of his parents. The SFI says Sudeesh was stabbed 37 times by "RSS fascists”.In 1999, KT Jayakrishnan of BJP, a schoolteacher, was killed in the classroom with blood spilling on his sixth standard students. The terrified children had to undergo psychiatric treatment.The precise number of political killings in the region is hard to get, though the police claim that the number is no more than 200 in last 40 years. An RTI petition revealed that 56 people had died in political violence during the 10 years between 1997 and 2008.The RSS claims that it's the worst victim of "communist terrorism”. But the swayamsevaks evidently do not subscribe to the philosophy that when one is slapped on one cheek by the enemy one must turn the other cheek too. The CPM claims that more than 300 of its activists have been eliminated by "RSS criminals” since 1980. The party's website lists many of these "martyrs”.But this week's murder of Sujith came at a particularly embarrassing time for the CPM's state and central leaderships. And it was not just because the party's leaders were tirelessly talking about freedom and democracy in the JNU context.Only three days before Sujith was killed, P Jayarajan, the Kannur district secretary of CPM, surrendered to a court to face trial for the September 2014 murder of RSS worker Elanthottathil Manoj.CPM workers threw home-made bombs at the car in which Manoj was travelling and, when the vehicle lost control, stabbed him.Manoj's crime was that he had unsuccessfully tried to kill Jayarajan in 1999. The CBI, which was asked to probe the case, said Jayarajan was the "kingpin and mastermind” behind Manoj's murder as well as "several other brutal crimes”.Jayarajan had earlier been arrested for the murder of Muslim League worker Abdul Shukoor. Earlier this month, the Kerala High Court ordered a CBI inquiry into Shukoor's killing after the police said the CPM's "intimidatory tactics” had prevented them from conducting a proper investigation.After Manoj's murder, Jayarajan had said that the Congress and the Sangh Parivar were colluding to implicate CPM in false cases to make his party look like a "terrorist outfit.” But nobody was convinced.Jayarajan's bluff was called by his own son Jain Raj, who boasted on a social media site that the killing was "long awaited”, which prompted the police to slap a case on the son as well.This was not the first time that CPM boasted of its killings. In 2012, senior CPM leader MM Mani made a chilling confession at a public rally that the party had methodically eliminated its rivals in the Idukki district in 1980s. He was arrested.At the root of this mindless violence has always been the perception of threat from political adversaries. The CPM has always been in a panic over RSS taking away its supporters. This fear only strengthened in the last five years, and that's not surprising.The BJP increased its vote share from 4.75 per cent in the 2006 assembly elections to 6.06 in the 2011 assembly elections, to 10.3 per cent in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and an all-time high of 13.3 per cent in the 2015 civic elections.Kerala has been calm since Monday's killing. But a peaceful Kerala makes people more tense than a tense Kerala. During tension, one knows whose murder is causing it. During peace, one has no way of knowing who will be next.</comment>

<comment>Intellectuals demand ban on word “Anti National”, for people who want to Destroy India. They want it replaced with “Differently patriotic”. (by The Reviewer, Faking News, 19-2-16)</comment>

<comment>Kashmir is a valley surrounded by might mountains on all side. What if govt. drops a nuclear bomb there? Would that solve all problems of Kashmiris?</comment>

<comment>Ha ha.. I wonder what these commie free loaders call their parents....Devices to give birth ..I guesd</comment>

<comment>Well if islamist separatists in Kashmir think that because of idiot hindutva chaps branding people antinational etc, this country will suddenly allow redrawing of borders then they are day dreaming fools. The constitutional status of Kashmir is a non negotiable, of course there can be things like more autonomy but there cannot be any separation.</comment>

<comment>No such thing as more autonomy to any part of Hindustan, specially to the Muslim majority state like Kashmir. I keep on asking the the same question again and again, Why are Muslims still in Hindustan when they wanted a separate country of their own ? They have Pakistan/Bangladesh to emigrate to, so why pollute our country. We must create a muslim fee Hindustan. Period.</comment>
