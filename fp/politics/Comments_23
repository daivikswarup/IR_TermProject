<comment>After all RSS/BJP were VICTIMS of emergency. If I were Modi I would seize the psychological democratic space urgently and make Seditious speech a fundamental right. Also I would bring laws to ban torture in custody, bringing India on par with laws of the world[read below 1988 UN resolution banning torture. Is the ideology of Gandhian Socialism of Vajpayee paralyzing him? Friends like Vajpayee cause more damage than enemies as always.=============================================BJP should have been imaginative and made SEDITIOUS SPEECH A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT.

<comment>ROFL.... see sangis supporting h silence...and to think someone said maun-mohan singh some time back ....so when it coems to them any rule is ok....</comment>

<comment>No useful purpose will be served by Modi joining the fracas. Opposition will be only too glad to twist his statement to mean something entirely different from what was intended. In a country where people are driven by perceptions rather than facts, it is perhaps best to remain silent. No point in getting into an argument with people who are not amenable to reason.</comment>

<comment>Indira Gandhi always blamed "foreign hand" when things went wrong or when she messed up. Modi now blames conspirators within the country for his ineptitude, incompetence and incapability. There is only so much you can expect from a man who has barely studied till class 8th and has built his reputation based on fake PR, using expensive PR agencies. When he placed Smriti Irani as HR Minister, it was evident that Modi does not have simple understanding about whom to place where. The fact that Irani has not contributed anything positive and have rather been messing up with university authorities, academicians and students prove that how unfit she is for the position.</comment>

<comment>BJP should not have been “conservative” in the bad sense of the word. It should have been imaginative and made SEDITIOUS SPEECH A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. The logically the only punishment for hot  air is cold air – that is when the person works in a MNC in a AC room. The problem with BJP is it wants to be congress+cow as Arun Shourie puts it.==========================================================Congress government did not ratifiy [made into laws] 1988 United Nations resolution on Torture.

Indian state tutors them to NOT see that reservation policy caste certificate holders who murder merit practice cannibalistic culture. The problem is no Nation practicing cannibalism human sacrifice can be a democracy! Bureaucratic Indian state, still follows the laws of British Bureaucracy.Lack of free speech [sedition laws]and reservation policy was promoted and encouraged by British Bureaucracy which saw to it that Indian share of GDP fell from 28% after East India Company's rule to 3%. Brahmins are modern dalits who are sold by the Indian bureaucracy - they even have a plan to bring in reservation in private sector.What is the secret that BJP/Congress policy are always similar. That is because after having both parties call each other anti-national, the moot question remains WHO IS THE NATION? Why are parties subservient to it? NATION  is the Indian bureaucracy, which maintains its power by INTELLIGENT rigging[read indiaevm . org elections by Electronic Voting Machines]. It is the same bureaucracy which makes ease of doing business and nations progress very very low. Unfortunately Modi trusts in the same bureaucracy================================================================Emergency and socialist congress terrorists hoisting national flag in RSS office?. Actually it became Indira Gandhi's flag after emergency. Congress chief's Barooah words still vibrant "India is Indira and Indira is India" - then it must be true of National flag as well. Socialism[legal robbery] introduced into constitution during emergency HAS to lead to single party [single family in India] dictatorship.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interestingly the Topiwallah Khejriwal does not speak of free speech1)If cannibalism and human sacrifice is practiced in a country can it be democratic?2)Simply voting does not make a Nation democratic. India was and is a Ocholocracy [mob rule] because by definition Individual rights like merit is murdered by reservation policy and Individual rights like property rights was murdered by socialism [legal robbery]. Along with voting Individual [smallest minority ] rights should be protected.3)Interestingly socialism was introduced into constitution by Indira Gandhi, CPI and KGB during emergency. Lack of free speech and  reservation policy was promoted and encouraged by British Bureaucracy which saw to it that Indian share of GDP fell from 28% after East India Company's rule to 3%. Like all governments it was inefficient spend thrift and became bankrupt. Laws should be made guaranteeing free speech, BECAUSE India should not be backward. The old colonial law restricting free speech IS anti-national-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BJP [See Khattar’s statement]is anti National as it wants to give reservations to Jats at the expense of merit seats without disturbing OBC Quota. BJP is anti-national. What MORAL right does left have to function in a multi party democracy when they are for single party dictatorship? Have left students forgotten Polpot Stalin who crushed INDIVIDUALS for building collective? Left is anti-human. Why was communist parties not banned. Kanhaiya Kumar, member of CPI, INDIVIDUALLY  can be forgiven because communist parties were not banned.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What if the state is captured by a mob? India is a Ocholocracy [mob rule] as Individual rights( like merit) is murdered, by definition, as by reservation policy and Individual right of property rights are murdered by Socialism. Will you call Jats who destroyed an entire state as anti-National? Will you call kapus anti-National as they burnt a train. Reservation agitation is action as compared to just hot air of sloganeering [logically punishment should also be hot air]. VP Singh has made constitution anti-national and Modi I suspect will bring private sector reservations to become another VP Singh----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------No Support to Khalid. Kanhaiya Kumar is different as he is not a member of communist Democratic Students Union which is for the murder of Individual rights and is for collectivism. Communists support reservation policy, which is murder of Individual right of merit and also are for demolishing property rights another important Individual right.Kanhaiya Kumar as PM!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------However Let us examine Sedition laws------------------------------------1)Law of Vikamaditya: A prostitute hears a Brahmin who says to his friend that she had appeared in the Brahmins man's dreams and she was wonderful. The Prostitute drags the Brahmin to Vikramaditya for her fees. Vikramaditya hangs a bag of Gold and asks the prostitute to get her fees from the MIRROR. If service is virtual reward is also virtual. In sedition laws if the 'crime' is talking then the punishment should also be 'talking'2)USA Laws protect a person who burns the National Flag as the crime is CONSIDERED virtual and is not action. State acts when the 'crime' is in action3)In Kedar Nath Singh’s Case, 5 judges of the Supreme Court – a Constitution bench – made it clear that allegedly seditious speech and expression may be punished only if the speech is an ‘incitement’ to ‘violence’, or ‘public disorder’. Subsequent cases have further clarified the meaning of this phrase. In Indra Das v. State of Assam and Arup Bhuyan v. State of Assam, the Supreme Court unambiguously stated that only speech that amounts to “incitement to imminent lawless action” can be criminalised.There is a flaw in the LOGIC  of supreme court. How can an INDIVIDUAL be punished for the actions of the mob - particularly when India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] as the reservation policy agitation of Kapus and Jats showed. IS IT THE FAULT OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAT INDIA HAS BECOME EXPLOSIVE? HOW SHOULD THE INDIVIDUAL KNOW IN ADVANCE if a situation will explode? The faulty logic of mixed economy[read article on mixed economy down below] and acts of VP Singh, which made the constitution anti-National. Indira Gandhi has made the constitution anti-national by inserting socialism[as by definition legal robbery, as distinct from charity and implies forceful SNATCHING]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arun SHourie put the problem in two words Present BJP govt is congress+cow. He implied Modi has been a failure. Failed persons in politics can be dangerous. I strongly suspect that he will try to bring in private sector reservations and try to become another VP SIngh, who made the constitution anti-national along with Indira Gandhi when she inserted legal robbery of socialism into constitution.--------------------------------------------------------------------The solution is to test PM on the basis of  MERIT. He has not been proactive. I had recommended, earlier:Now BJP/RSS should be creative, PROACTIVE, and bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics. USA experience shows that goons kill each other in presence of free gun laws. None will kill with a legal weapon.2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=========================================================Mixed economy is a fascist economy. Bureaucracy/mafia politician becomes the supreme arbiter. Consider reservation policy: The only work of a government is protection of Individual rights - Jefferson, 2nd president of USA.. President of India as head of state has to commit suicide as merit, an Individual right, is murdered by reservation policy. The state is duty bound to protect Individual from mobs. Such arguments are not answered but ignored -- what the state does is right. Nazism was stateism like socialism. Those who could obtain power could justify state-sponsored murder and plunder by pointing out that since morals don't really exist and are merely a product of one's class or upbringing, there is no moral argument against the state version of murder and plunder.Socialism introduced into constitution during emergency is legal robbery. Way forward is capitalism[another name of freedom]Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim’s gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of money taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials and mafia politicians.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, but that it cannot be used honestly.Why does not the state allot a seat strictly on merit and snatch it away OPENLY?Gandhian Socialism of BJP is Gandhiism [selling of ones supporters to gain support of Jinnah and Muslims and Socialism is legal robbery]</comment>

<comment>This a@@h0le i.e Modi, feel very sorry to call him that, since I am also one among the crores of a$$h0le who helped him in occupying the premium position in our democracy, has not lived through even 1/8th of the expectation, hyped by himself through his bombastic speeches during the 2014 election and later on also. Modi has literally taken us on a donkey ride, even his much famed corporate buddies are distancing themselves from him and his Govt. except for the core loyalists. It seams that Modi only knows to play the role of electioneering war machine, else he is only as good as a dud Iraqi scud and his responsible responses to the current situation of India as good as an extinct DODO, he always scoots out of crises like the Gaddhe ke sar pe ka siingh or the Hoodini Act, with all these he still finds time to vilify MMS</comment>

<comment>Ouch. Why so angry?</comment>

<comment>Nothing to worry. Modi will soon address a massive rally of patriotic NRI's in Ethiopia and the whole country (except anti-nationalists) will be dancing in joy. All other problems will be auto solved.</comment>

<comment>Will there b samba dance too by mallu masala ?😆</comment>

<comment>Ethiopia will donate money for Indian welfare once modi gets his selfie and they will immediately start business with our very own Adani and Ambani's.</comment>

<comment>He could show his 56 inch chest by:1. Arresting the agitators in Lal Chowk in Kashmir everyday. He is running the government there. Or arrest any of PDP legislators next time they come to Delhi. There are videos up the wazoo on youtube showing these people.2. Arrest Akalis MPs and MLA who supported Khalistan slogan. Use your CBI to investigate and you will find each of the Akalis MP has given the money to this noble cause of Khalistan.The Akali party has adopted Khalistan as platform for their program but they are still Feku;s brother.3. Arrest AGP MLAs in Assam instead of tying up with them as Feku is trying to do. They ran 10 year of secessionist war against India when they were student. Now they are Fekus favorite thugs.4. If you check most of the lawyers who attacked students, don't have proper degree and are running illegal activity.No Feku can only arrest some stupid students shouting slogans because he is scared of them. Real terrorists they are his buddies.It is not maun vrat but shows desire and ability to do what he can for cause of this country. More Selfies and maan ki baat will save the country.</comment>

<comment>If the opinion polls are to be believed at face value and within just two years, the Congress is able to double its seat tally from its worst ever performance in 2014 hitting rock bottom, then it is very easy to discern as to  what will be Feku's fate at the end of his term which has still three more years to go !!</comment>

<comment>In a nutshell, he has not only failed to match  the hype  he manufactured, but worse still, staring down the barrel with a totally insipid, inept and ineffective performance even disappointing his trusted faithfuls who are finding it extremely discomfiting to recount his achievements and find themselves cornered when countered with factual analysis of his overall performance which has been abysmal at best !!</comment>

<comment>Samriti Irani In LS........Here is the full transcriptListen to what I have to say. You accuse us of being intolerant, be tolerant. I am giving my answer. Or do I claim to be a victim of my circumstances and say that I am married to a micro-minority family. I am a woman, and hence you did not allow me to speak in this House. Do not play politics with me.Those seeking response on an issue are specifically the ones who ask for personal favours, for example, to get their kids' admission in Kendriya Vidyalaya.Congress leader V Hanumantha Rao had written a letter, saying that there is a need for justice in Hyderabad University. He said that it was under the rule of the vice chancellor, which was appointed by the UPA government where Dalit students were committing suicide. Rao had urged me to take action and launch a probe.As soon as I got the news of Rohith Vemula's suicide, I called KCR [chief minister of Telangana], only to plead that the law and order situation should be under control. I was told, "Sir is busy right now." I never issued a public statement against the chief minister thinking that he will call back, but he never called back. But I have a call record. I even spoke to his daughter.I issued several letters in reply to Rao's letters. An idea has been created that the HRD minister responds only to government ministers. I have always tried to resolve issues irrespective of the complainant's caste, creed or religion.I am not going to apologise for doing my duty. If you want to leave, you may do so. You never wanted to listen to my response, you never had the intention to do so.You don't have the courage to listen to what I have to say. You just want to do your politics. Listen to what I have to say, if you have the courage to do so.Asaduddin Owaisi and I are political opponents. He had once written a letter to me, I responded to it accordingly. Am I being condemned only because my department had issued a letter? I was just doing my duty.Oomen Chandy, Shashi Tharoor also sent letters to me, and we responded immediately. Today, I am being accused of discrimination? Even I can do the same.Political parties are busy trying to use the death of a child [Rohith Vemula] as a political weapon. The committee which suspended Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula was not constituted by our government, but by the UPA regime.I looked at the case as the death of a child and not as a death of a Dalit.My name is Smriti Irani. I challenge you to identify my caste.I am enraged by the manner in which a child's death (Rohith Vemula) is being used as a political weapon.I am taking it personally. I'll tell you how the entire incident has been used as a political tool.According to a report submitted to the Telangana high court, the police had reached Rohith's hospital at 7:20 pm when they found the body. The police said that when they reached the hostel, they found the room open and the dead body was on the table. A hand written suicide note was found. The suicide note that was left behind does not blame anyone.This is not my submission. This is what the police said. No one allowed a doctor near this child, to revive this child. Instead, his body was used as a political tool. No police was allowed till 6:30 am the following morning. Who tried to help this child?The ones who passed judgement are not the ones appointed by the BLP-led NDA but by the Congress party.Rahul Gandhi made the most of the opportunity and visited the hostel twice, something which he had never done before. Have you ever seen him visiting the same place twice? Did he do the same when 600 students died in the Telangana movement? Rohith blamed no one, yet Rahul tried to use this child as a political tool. The child in his suicide note said that no one is responsible for my death, yet you seek to use this child for your own political ends. That is the tragedy. The people who espouse the cause of free speech and attack this government, who say we are anti-minority, anti-Dalit, anti-tribal and time and again, they've been requested to not make it 'us against them'. I am not certifying your patriotism, but do not demean mine. I am not certifying your idea of India, but do not demean mine. To them I say this. Madam speaker, this is the permission slip from JNU.On JNU rowThe slip clearly says that Umar Khalid, one student, wanted to book the venue from 5 pm to 7.30 pm for the night. The form asks what is the purpose of booking the venue. He says poetry reading. The form asks whether any special arrangement is required. He says electricity for mike. Very well, the university gives him the permission. What transpired later has been question marked by many people. They said - Arrey yeh jhoota hai, woh jhoota [He lied, they lied]. Tariq Anwar said: Let the university carry out its investigation, and then let the police come. This paper is the report of the security department of the university.This paper is the report of the security department of the university, dated February 11, 2016. In this, 35 security personnel and 3 female guards gave their statement with their signatures. They said that at 16.45 pm, the personnel reached the venue. 38 people have given their response. They are part of the security of the university, and not the police. They say - "The crowd started to swell. Umar and Anirban stood there. 'Afzal Guru, Maqbool Bhat zindabad', 'Kashmir ki azadi tak jung rahegi', 'Bharat ki barbaadi tak jung rahegi', 'jis Kashmir ko khoon se seencha, woh Kashmir humara hai', 'hum kya maange azadi, bandook se lenge azadi', 'go India, go back', 'Indian Army murdabad'. There were a few people present there with their faces hidden with cloth.This is not a video, not a police, not an Arnab Goswami, this is the report of the security personnel who do not have connection with the government.Madam, an office order is issued by JNU. The letter is addressed to the complete staff and faculty at the university. This committee, which again has nothing to do with the government, ... A Communist party leader had said here that Smriti Irani had tried her best to get her own vice chancellor, but someone else was deputed. The person who we tried for was a Padma winner, decorated by the Congress government, not ours. This is the right of the President to appoint a VC.This is the same VC, who we did not appoint, issued this. "Misrepresentation of a proposed cultural event, although the objective was to hold a political meeting. Forcefully holding the event when the permission to hold was withdrawn. Creating a law and order situation in the campus and the prima facie inquiry committee finds the following individuals to be involved. The individuals who have been named by the faculty of JNU - Syed Umar Khalid, Anirban Bhattacharya, Ashutosh Kumar, Rama Naga, Anant Prakash Narayan, Kanhaiya Kumar, Aishwarya Adhikary, Shweta Raj. Considering the seriousness of the offence, and in order to enable a fair inquiry into the incident, the inquiry committee has recommended that the above mentioned students be academically suspended from JNU with immediate effect, during the pendency of the inquiry. However, they are allowed to stay in their respective hostels during the period of inquiry."This is not an order issued by the Home Ministry. The university faculty had issued this judgment based on facts.To accuse is known to be a sign of a successful democracy. I am presenting this evidence to counter people who have accused us. This has been attested by registrar of the university. The registrar was not appointed by us, but by the previous government. This pamphlet is dated February 22, 2013. Malikarjun Khadge was passionately saying today - "Hang everybody, including professors, if they speak against the nation." If he was here today, I would have shown him this.Two professors came out with a Kashmir solidarity rally during his government. "To show solidarity for the struggle freedom in Kashmir, and refuse to be a part of the collective conscience of this country."Another evidence we have from the university. "Abolish death penalty. Burn effigy of home ministry, not minister. Speak up against the judicial murder and hanging of Yakub Memon."Who was there in Mumbai on March 12? It's my mother's birthday, hence I remember that day till now. Bombs went off. Indians died. The terrorists did not ask the religion or caste of the people who died.This poster says: "Supreme Court judge, Hindu Fascist State of India, the state was scared of Yakub Memon. Our media is a communal corporate media. We are a murderous republic and our cannibal collective conscience was satiated by hanging Yakub Memon's. We must rise against this judicial muder."A call to rise against Supreme Court, which they approach for bail now. That is the strength of my democracy. A call to rise against the president of India, to whom you go and implore and say - "Nyay kijiye [please deliver justice]." The people who call him a hangman go knocking on his doors and he opens his doors and welcomes them. That is the strength of my democracy.Another MP here said that I am from Communist Party and Kanhaiya is my party member. Brother, I agree.Madam, this is a poster, which has the name of a child, unfortunately. I look at this child who has been mobilised as a weapon against the State. This is a child who does not have an idea that India is one, but a child who must have been infected with this thought. By those who want to bear arms to overthrow the state. It bears the name of Kanhaiya Kumar, Shaila Rasheed, Rama Naga - they are all members of the student union. Apart from saying - "Condemning the hanging of Afzal Guru", they claim it as a "nervous attempt by the Congress government." And this, Madam Speaker, is a notice given out on February 10, 2016. On the 9th night this transpires in the campus, and on the 10th this pamphlet is stuck all across with signatures.It says - "The public meeting was also disrupted for Mahishasur Martyrdom Day."What is Mahishasur Martyrdom Day, madam speaker? Our government has been accused. I miss today Sugata Bose and Saugata Roy in the House - champions of free speech, because I want to know if they will discuss this particular topic which I am about to enunciate in the House, on the streets of Kolkata. I dare them this.Posted on October 4, 2014. A statement by the SC, ST and minority students of JNU. And what do they condemn? May my God forgive me for reading this."Durga Puja is the most controversial racial festival, where a fair-skinned beautiful goddess Durga is depicted brutally killing a dark-skinned native called Mahishasur. Mahishasur, a brave self-respecting leader, tricked into marriage by Aryans. They hired a sex worker called Durga, who enticed Mahishasur into marriage and killed him after nine nights of honeymooning during sleep."Freedom of speech, ladies and gentleman. Who wants to have this discussion on the streets of Kolkata? I want to know. Will Rahul Gandhi will stand for this freedom. I want to know. For these are the students. What is this depraved mentality? I have no answers for it. [Irani throws away the pamphlet]Then, I thought, when many leaders say - "They are kids. They are saying it. Pardon them." It is possible. But how does this depravity gets seeded into the minds of our children?Unfortunately, the rows of the Congress party here are empty, madam speaker. I have said it time and again, 'shiksha ko ranbhoomi mat banao' (Don't make education a battleground). No one listened to this request of mine in both Houses. Today I am compelled to say this, madam speaker, are these just slogans?I seek to quote a Roman philosopher, who said - "A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gates freely. His lie whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of the government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor, he speaks in the accent familiar to his victims. He wears their face and arguments that appeals to the baseless that lies deep in the hearts of men. He rots the soul of the nation. He works secretly as an unknown. In a night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear."If I had quoted Chanakya here today then people said it was saffronisation.This is the reason I seek to quote a Roman philosopher.I wondered, where do our kids learn from? I am presenting an example in this House today, which just came to my desk. This is a history book for students of class 4 - Teacher's Reader. What are our teachers taught? The author of this book is Teesta Setalvad. This book has been commissioned by UPA's Kapil Sibal. The same UPA whose chairperson is Soniaji. Let's see what is to be taught to student of class 4."In our text and syllabus, we continue to perpetuate the colonial legacy of portraying ancient India, as synonymous with Hindu and Medieval India past with the Muslim." I quote from this book, Madam Speaker. Arvind Sawantji is from Maharashtra. This book was given to Don Bosco, Matunga. The school of my colleague Piyush Goyal."When we teach Shivaji, Akbar, Aurangzeb as responsible educators and animators, we need to ask which Shivaji do we need to take into the classroom."It is not only against Shivaji that is taught. Congress politicians allowed the killings for three days during the Sikh riots. That is also taught."Hindu-Christian riots in Kanya Kumari. How the propaganda of Hindu organisations target Christian minorities."You are teaching this to a child in the 4th standard. This is their idea of secular education. History taught to standard 6th. I quote, madam speaker."Kashmir is a much demonised land today...{pause} that the State militates against. The atrocities of the Indian State."Are we shocked that our students go to universities and say "Kashmir ki azadi tak jung ladenge.."?Scenario 4 on Page 5 - order issued to Delhi schools after the death of Indira Gandhi."Check what an English teacher is teaching." One of the words given to the children to draft a sentence was the word arrive. Of the several children who raised their hands, the one that the teacher chose to read out is - 'When a Sikh arrived in Delhi, he was killed by a Hindu.'Scenario 2 - The title is fascinating - 'Breeding Prejudiced Minds'. This commissioned by the UPA, led by the Congress party, given to children in the 6th standard. They are taught.Scenario 3 - Teaching of history in school boards all over Maharashtra. Has a single prescribed textbook on Shivaji. Teachers from the school in Bombay have expressed great difficulty in controlling emotions. One of them has said - "The schools that have active enrolment of Muslim students are rushed through the chapter on Afzal Khan and Shivaji's confrontation. It is a politically and socially loaded connotation. I can't meet eye to eye with Muslim students, so I start my chapter with an apology. There are many Afzals in my class." Says this teacher teaching in class 6th.I begged and I pleaded, don't make it about us and them. Our children are not vote banks. But nobody heard me.NCERT had warned not to distribute these books. No one heeded to their warning. Wasn't the NCERT of our government? The committee that studied these books and incidents, I am compelled to say that one of the committee members is a Muslim Vice Chancellor appointed to his post by the Congress government.An income tax officer, who served under the Congress government, now a Supreme Court lawyer. I did it because I will not be accused of politicising something, which should be a matter of concern for every Indian citizen and Parliamentarian. What do those committee members said after they read these books."This committee fails to understand that to what and whose purpose is this trust serving?" By quoting from authors from Pakistan writing pertaining to education of Indian students to an impressionable mind of a standard 6 student. This committee was enraged when the name suggested intention and action - Allah zarmeen Pakistan, Hindutva hell in Hindustan.Madam speaker, I have not shied away from answering any question in this Parliament.My plea is this. Across universities, when vice-chancellors said that we want to raise our flags proudly. They were condemned. Mr Gandhi went to Uttar Pradesh and said -"All these VCs belong to the RSS." I am sure he doesn't know that even today that among the chancellors of central universities, there are 20 VCs who were appointed by the Congress. 16 VCs were again appointed by the Congress. I challenge any of these Congress-appointed VCs to come and say with evidence that I have saffronised them, I will quit politics.In this same House perhaps. Sonia ji is not here, so can't tell her. Atal Bihari Vajpayee had said - "India is not a piece of land. It is a nation that is alive Rashtrapurush."He had said - "Yeh vandan ki dharti hai, abhinandan ki dharti hai / Yeh arpan ki bhoomi hai, darpan ki bhoomi hai / Ki nadi nadi humaare liye Ganga hai, iska kankar kankar humaare liye Shankar hai / Hum jiyenge to iss Bharat ke liye, marenge to iss Bharat ke liye / Aur marne ke baad bhi, Gangajal mein behti huee humaare asthiyon ko koi sunega, to ek hi awaz aayegi - Bharat Mata Ki Jai."The question that rises is that the same Atal Bihari Vajpayee who had said this had supported Indira Gandhi. Considered her a reflection of Durga. When for the pride of the nation, Indiraji had said - "Go and protect humanity."Today it seems that politics makes strange bedfellows. Sugata Bose delivered a speech, that was academically very good. I applaud to such speeches. Soniaji and Rahulji were compelled. We all should compliment each other. Shook his hands. I only wished that Dr Bose was to gift them a book called The Dead Reckoning by Sharmila Bose, Dr Bose's sister. A renowned historian. In the book, she writes that the Bangladesh liberation war was a fallacy. That the Pakistani army did nothing to Bangladeshis that Indira Gandhi went to support. The question that rises now - [Satta to Indira Gandhi ne bhi khoyi thi lekin unke bete ne Bharat ki barbadi ke naaro ka samarthan nahi kiya tha]. Even Indira Gandhi lost power, was out of power, but his son never supported slogans of India's destruction.The death of students is unfortunate. UGC had formulated regulations in 2012, in which it was required to have an anti-discrimination officer in all campuses. We had called a meeting of VCs. They accepted that there will be such an office in all campuses.We set up the Judicial Commission. Those students weren't delivered justice, the ones who lost their lives when the Congress in power. We did not indulge in biased politics. We said - The law should prevail, and hang those who are found guilty. It was attempt. I try to attempt every day.This is my request to all. If we make a battlefield out of campuses, vote banks out of kids, what will a few astray students from JNU raise slogans about. This nation will be led to the brink of anarchy by a politics that makes an opportunity out a dead student. Let the law take its course please. Let the police do its work. I declare that if Rahul Gandhi had asked me to go to JNU together and tell the students that the tricolour you are ashamed to hoist, and the nation that you wish to be destroyed, it is this same university from where students have gone and lost their lives on the border so that you can chant anti-national slogans in this campus. Rahulji did not do such a thing.My request to you all is that wherever you face a challenge - you said SC/ST kids should be in faculty - this is the same request I made of all vice-chancellors. I have myself requested them to listen to all children, especially who to them with emotional legacies and social challenges. It is incumbent upon us to provide them refuge and a productive life. My request is, help me build this nation, and not destroy it from within.Thank you madam speaker.</comment>

<comment>Great job for the transcript, Kudos to you, Kamal. That which ought to have been the duty of the media, you have done it. Hope, the Indians watch Smriti's reply on the You Tube to know her mettle, in case they have missed live. I wish as also the New York Times and The Guardian and all those who have returned their awards watch her reply on the You Tube.</comment>

<comment>Emperor Babur here...  I did many wars, lost all in Afghanistan but won all easily in India. I beat all darpok Hindu kings and soldiers all the time. I beat Rajputs, I beat, Sikhs, I beat Biharis, I I beat short and dark Dravidians in the South, I beat Marathas but I did not have to fight the Gujaratis. They gave money immediately and rolled over....... I beat them all so much so that there was nobody left to beat.... Nobody could beat me... So I asked my favorite Begum from the Harem to beat me in the bedroom.... GOSH... I had no idea then that this practice would be so popular today in Western culture as BDSM.</comment>

<comment>Hmmm...its maun ki baat....silence speaks </comment>

<comment>Silence speaks! It speaks to say that he is not to challenge the RSS orchestrated agenda.</comment>

<comment>Excerpt  - At the weekend, rather than intervening, Modi blamed unnamed outside conspirators for "hatching conspiracies every day to finish and defame me".Pathetic indeed. His 56" chhaati has become 56" kamar. He had "imagined" that he would be in control, the country would be at his beck & call and would be able to do what he pleases - "my way or the highway".  Only a naive person would do that.The stark reality that Modi Sarkaar's agenda and its responses are being orchestrated by the RSS. Narendra Modi, a pracharak for over 40 years, has no locus standi to intervene and take an independent stand on any issue. Mohan Bhagwat & Co. call the shots.</comment>

<comment>All I will say is, easy to criticize loudly when in opposition, but difficult to talk when actually governing. Any talk will be misconstrued, no matter what the intentions and no matter how many supporters you have. The Internet has practially speaking killed the concept of leadership. I remember how BJP made a total and complete mockery of PM Singh statement that minorities have the first right to resources. No benefit of doubt was given to PM Singh. PM Modi is going to be more silent than ever in the coming days.</comment>

<comment>Cong, left and their pet media are laying regular traps for Modi, to distract him from his development agenda. They are manufacturing crisis after crisis and trying to create confusion, chaos and anarchy. They want Modi to get embroiled and fall into the traps they have purposefully laid in order to derail his development agenda. Modi is too smart to fall into their purposefully laid traps -- he is doing his best to stay focused when the opposition is doing everything to push what can be seen as agenda to keep india divided, weak and seen as ungovernable. He doesn't want to be dragged down into daily incidents and controversies that are being purposefully created to trap him. He knows that the crafty opposition wants him to lose his focus and balance by dragging him down to daily shouting and acrimonious debates as seen on TV and streets.</comment>

<comment>"Cong, left and their pet media are laying regular traps for Modi, to distract him from his development agenda. They are manufacturing crisis after crisis and trying to create confusion, chaos and anarchy".Actually, it is the RSS and its foot-soldiers (he is also one of them) are laying regular traps and he does not have the "authority (from his masters) not to fall in the traps. </comment>

<comment>When even lesser known BJP leaders say something they blame Narendra Modi. Mr. Modi's ministers have spoken a plenty on the subjects (Rohith's suicide and JNU incident) and are still talking in the Parliament, why Modi is not given credit for that?  Modi is there only to take blame?  Facts coming out from the Parliament is, Rohith was taken down from hanging position, but with proper help, he could have been revived but his 'handlers' did not let any doctor or a policeman come near him for many hours.  Were they waiting for him to die?  And on JNU, Kanhaiya and his friends got permission for a poetry function and misuse it for this anti-national activities.  Kanhaiya is not cooperating with police.  Considering all this he is guilty for sure.</comment>

<comment>Yo Hindu Slaves...... Do you see the Taj Mahal? At least in beautiful pictures? How about the Red Fort where your nation looting and corrupt leaders give speeches?  Remember each time that your slave forefathers carried bricks day in and day out with Mughul lashes... they did not eat Mughlai Chicken Biryani or Shahi Beef Kabob... That is luxury food..... Remember that each time you eat Mughlai food in expensive Indian restaurants. You like fair skin and long legs of Katrina Kaif, Alisha Bi (Hema Malini), Tabu, Saira Banu and Shabana Azmi? ..... my soldiers gave Mughul genes to your short and dark Dravidian women. Thank Allah for not having to see actors like Rajnikanth every day.... Once a slave... always a slave..... You all have Mughul blood... Auarangabad, Gaziabad, Islampur, Shayari, Music, Dance, Architecture....It is everywhere.... You cannot erase your coward history of 1,000 years......Now get back to work... No slacking... Babri Masjid must be completed on schedule..</comment>
