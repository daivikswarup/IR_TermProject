<comment>No Left... They ruined Bengal for 34 years, destroyed industries with all 'bandhs', made people live in misery begging in railway stations. They made people poor there to create a 'Garib ka Sarkar'. While Left leaders their won children studied and lived in foreign countries.Left parties are real 'WITCHES' to India's success and growth story.</comment>

<comment>Whether you like it or not, history teaches us, as long there is injustice, exploitation of man by man, deprivation and discrimination in society, Left is bound to bounce back again and again, despite being declared dead...</comment>

<comment>I entirely agree with you. That is why, societies which have adopted democracy as their political system,and, free market capitalism as their economic philosophy,have also evolved a system of governance by rule of law. This effectively safe guards against exploitation.One can also consider different models of distribution of economic benefits, provided, the capable are made to expand the economic pie. The communists world over have essentially,restricted this expansion, and thereby, capping the resources for the very same people whom they espouse to support. This is precisely the reason, why the communist system became unsustainable, and had to disintegrate every where</comment>

<comment>20 days have passedWhy modi not arresting 5 Pakistanis in JNU who shouted anti-India slogansUndoctored Video showing 5 Pakistanis aged about 35-45 along with 1 female in burqua shouted these slogansGovt only arrested nationlisist Indians like Kanhaiya who were asking Icards to remove such elements from the campus as 20 polceman stationed there just watching the drama.Ok. You go to Pakisytsan to eat cake in Lahore but when Pakis shouting slogans arrest them. Even Manhoman was bolder than modi. Totally darpok pm India has got</comment>

<comment>Those 'five' in disguise were agent provocateurs sent by sarkari student wing... Delhi Police and Home Ministry and their Bhakts have named them "Pakistanis", but never tried to identify and arrest them... If it is so, it is a big threat to the security of the Capital...</comment>

<comment>Whoever they wereThey shouted those slogans not KanhaiyaThis govt has failed to arrest them. modi is a darpok PM</comment>

<comment>But, how can they arrest their own men?</comment>

<comment>Even better then if we cal lthem PakistanisCoz then they wont say that these are our men shouting slogansAnd if they arrest them they will be exposed b4 the world</comment>

<comment>Agree...</comment>

<comment>Spread the word in campuses and social mediaTarget modi sarkar helping Pakistanis shouting anti-India slogansOffence is best defence. If we bcome defence they wil lstart hitting us more.If we are offensive in calling modi as weak PM. Then some of their supporters join us. </comment>

<comment>Government Brahmins[supporters of reservation policy] are cannibals of merit. Indian state tutors them to NOT see that reservation policy caste certificate holders who murder merit practice cannibalistic culture. The problem is no Nation practicing cannibalism human sacrifice can be a democracy! Bureaucratic Indian state, still follows the laws of British Bureaucracy.Lack of free speech [sedition laws]and reservation policy was promoted and encouraged by British Bureaucracy which saw to it that Indian share of GDP fell from 28% after East India Company's rule to 3%. Brahmins are modern dalits who are sold by the Indian bureaucracy - they even have a plan to bring in reservation in private sector.What is the secret that BJP/Congress policy are always similar. That is because after having both parties call each other anti-national, the moot question remains WHO IS THE NATION? Why are parties subservient to it? NATION  is the Indian bureaucracy, which maintains its power by INTELLIGENT rigging[read indiaevm . org elections by Electronic Voting Machines]. It is the same bureaucracy which makes ease of doing business and nations progress very very low. Unfortunately Modi trusts in the same bureaucracy.</comment>

<comment>It is too late  for the left to resurrect itself.The new generation is more interested in peaceful pursuit of its avocations  than in agitations and disruptions  that we have known  the Left to be always indulging in.The left has given India nothing except  some slaogans and negative thoughts.</comment>

<comment>Right, the right has given us a lot more than we wanted. Example - Godseji, RSS, Shiv Sena, Bal Thackerayji, Mohan Bhagwatji, Gujarat 2002, Ayodhya, 1 Million and 1 riots, and the beloved leader.</comment>

<comment>The left is bankrupt of ideas, and is a spent force world wide. By attempting to organised all these movements as listed in this article, they can at best have a nuisance value, no transformation one. Even the most communists countries in Europe-part of the erst while Soviet Union, swear to fight Communism and Communists anywhere tooth and nail.All of them have Capitalism as their economic philosophy.My sincere suggestion to the two Communist parties, still surviving in India-they must announce voluntarily to dissolve their respective parties, and join one of the main stream parties  or retire from politics permanently. This will be better than facing annihilation/rejection at the hand of voters or playing bit roles in the political canvass.</comment>

<comment>The left is using the universities to get some mileage. Left is struggling in W. Bengal and Kerala. Stable in Tripura. In the rest of India, it's presence is insignificant.</comment>

<comment>The left has made people poor, ignorant and powerless, and people know that.  The left has no prayer in India, but will constantly give minor problems.</comment>

<comment>Their very existence in India is in jeopardy because serve as team B for dynasty.</comment>

<comment>I asked one of these JNU supporters a simple question. Are u an Indian? For him it was a stupid question. He incredulously declared that he does not have to prove his patriotism to any one! I said No problem. But do you know that these Afzal guru supporters from Srinagar Valley does not consider themselves as Indian. They will tell you that they came from Kashmir to India to study! What is the difference between you and them?</comment>

<comment>Are you Indian?If you are then why you making alliance with Afzal supporters PDP</comment>

<comment>j&k is not about kashmir only... the people of jammu and leh have a given a mandate and that is being respected... do you think pdp doesnot know this.. otherwise they would have pulled out of alliance long ago.. they know in re election also same result...thats the first time in ages kashmiris have been forced to realise the reality</comment>

<comment>wahchit bhi meri aur pat bhi</comment>

<comment>Bcos we desire a stable govt that is representative of people's choices in the valley... We may not always agree with our alliance partners on everything... but we respect the people's mandate and act accordingly... That's how democracy works, moron!</comment>

<comment>then people's mandate is 'support afzal.'</comment>

<comment>says who?? If you say, is it automatically people's mandate??</comment>

<comment>kaam karne ki aadat nahin hoti dono ko.. free main narre bazi karni ati hai bas..</comment>

<comment>I am not sure conclusion that Left will revive on account of the JNU episode is correct. To be branded anti national is not going to help their cause. As for the voters from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Castes , their votes will go to caste based parties and not the Left.  Leftist ideology is an idea whose time has gone.</comment>

<comment>BY PROVIDING WRONG HEADING FP AS ALWAYS TRYING TO PROP UP ITS LOOSING CAUSE, WITH RECENT INCIDENTS, LEFT IS COMPLETELY EXPOSED OF THEIR ANTI NATIONAL STAND AND EVERY INDIAN GOT TO SEE IN DAYLIGHT THERE IS NO fresh chance FORGET, THEY LOST WHATEVER LITTLE CHANCE THEY HAD!</comment>

<comment>well no, may some very little gains, but to say they may have gained a lifeline, no.</comment>

<comment>Remember Albania? In its effort to create a purely communist state, it did not have diplomatic relations with even the then Soviet Union. It was at a point of time probably the most isolated country in the world. And Albanians have given up communism for good. Even China has the duplicitous policy of promoting 'special economic zones' which is nothing but veiled capitalism.If getting a few minutes of limelight is 'revival', it is a different matter. But if we talk of relevance, the communist ideology has no place or need, not just in India but anywhere in the world.</comment>

<comment>An unprecedented mandate from the people in Delhi for the Aam Aadmi Party has invited an unprecedented wrath of the Modi government.As a journalist and editor, I had very closely observed his career graph and a long time ago I was convinced that in his style of politics, there was no place for dissent.It's not coincidental that four years before he became the Chief Minister of Gujarat, when the Gujarat riots had not yet taken place, world renowned sociologist, Ashish Nandy, after interviewing Narendra Modi for research, had said that that he had seen a classical fascist.The drama which unfolded on Monday, and whatever had been happening with the AAP government via the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, is a trailer for the political film to come in the near future.Today, I have no hesitation in saying that Indian democracy is heading for a constitutional dictatorship, where an emergency-like situation will be created, dissent and criticism will not have a place, political opponents will either languish in jail or be eliminated, institutions will lose their autonomy and will be made to serve the political interests of one man called Modi.The land of Gandhi will be turned into a banana republic.By Ashutosh.....</comment>

<comment>questioning of Afzal Guru's death sentence is anti-national, that is done by several intellectuals, social activists, lawyers and even Justice Shah, who believed that there were not many evidences to proof that he was instrumental in parliament attack. If organizing meeting and condemning the court decision are anti-national, u need to ban PDP party also, which is in power in Kashmir with the support of the BJP.</comment>

<comment>Dear, the 'students' were caught pants down while cursing their motherland and wishing its multiple divisions when soldiers are dying on the front protecting the same mother land. If u do not get it, only God can help u.....unless u also wish the same.</comment>

<comment>BJP's partner PDP has always visited the house of terrorists killed in gun battle with army to convey condolence. BJP caught pants down with that "traitor" PDP, in its lust for power.</comment>

<comment>The point is, did the JNU students carry out something that is not acceptable in terms of law and conscience? Answer is yes. Do not bring others to justify your commie bro/sis when they are caught with their pants down.</comment>

<comment>For communists Nation is not an entity so for them Nation and Nationalism are antidotes.For them Lenin occupies much higher place than Gandhi.In 1962 China War after the initial reversals of Indian Army .all the communist rejoiced and they made the statement that Our liberators have come and many started dreaming of dictatorship of Proletariats.It was President Kennedy who came to our rescue after Nehru begged him.He threatened China with Atomic attack and US B 52 bombers with Nuclear Arms were deployed in the eastern Theatre in the Airfields like Tezpur and Silchar.This real possibility made Chinese run away and Communist's dreams crashed</comment>

<comment>Emergency and socialist congress terrorists hoisting national flag in RSS office?. Actually it became Indira Gandhi's flag after emergency. Congress chief's Barooah words still vibrant "India is Indira and Indira is India" - then it must be true of National flag as well. Socialism[legal robbery] introduced into constitution during emergency HAS to lead to single party [single family in India] dictatorship.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Interestingly the Topiwallah Khejriwal does not speak of free speech1)If cannibalism and human sacrifice is practiced in a country can it be democratic?2)Simply voting does not make a Nation democratic. India was and is a Ocholocracy [mob rule] because by definition Individual rights like merit is murdered by reservation policy and Individual rights like property rights was murdered by socialism [legal robbery]. Along with voting Individual [smallest minority ] rights should be protected.3)Interestingly socialism was introduced into constitution by Indira Gandhi, CPI and KGB during emergency. And reservation policy was promoted and encouraged by British Bureaucracy which saw to it that Indian share of GDP fell from 28% after East India Company's rule to 3%. Like all governments it was inefficient spend thrift and became bankrupt4)Laws should be made guaranteeing free speech, BECAUSE India should not be backward. The old colonial law restricting free speech IS anti-national</comment>

<comment>>> property rights was murdered by socialismHaha. From where do you think the Zamindars got their land from, which was taken away by land reform act? Wait, lemme guess - it was given by the Gods during creation of earth, as vedas have said it? And right after that it also says that tribals should have no right to their lands, which are fit to be taken away without consent by crony corporations?Moditards' hypocrisy would be hilarious if it weren't for its tragic consequences (like sleeping with PDP, while bashing/arresting students for holding exact same views as PDP)</comment>

<comment>Come on. Even  land of one acre[tenancy] was looted by land reforms. It WAS hard earned money. Looters dont restrict themselves to one acre]. Dont give me brain washed logic of Indian state.Government Brahmins[supporters of reservation policy] are cannibals of merit. Indian state tutors them to NOT see that reservation policy caste certificate holders who murder merit practice cannibalistic culture.

<comment>Communist culture: Leadership is all high caste and rich.Foot soldiers to die: poor SC/ST.</comment>

<comment>how rich is Yechuri? are you confusing him with Jaitley?</comment>

<comment>I see you omitted the caste question.</comment>

<comment>Is Sitaram a Dalit? Why not a Dalit chief of CPI/M.</comment>

<comment>all bramhans are at the top of communism...you just name them....u will not find a single SC/ST...they are worst kind of hypocrite...they are freeloaders.....</comment>

<comment>Mr writetIn india people votesIf only wruters and media ancors vote than and than left and congress can revive.Unfortunately for them people of our country are far wiser than you idiots</comment>

<comment>Death of a dalit is a great political opportunity for all these rejected people and parties. Dalits can see through their gameplan very well and will refuse to become the stick in the hand of these elites to beat the govt. of the day whose leader is toiling day and night to get things done.</comment>

<comment>and even when the Dalit had blamed SFI for his downfall...</comment>

<comment>Right. Real justice for Vemula will be to investigate who struck off those damning lines about SFI/ASA from the suicide letter.</comment>

<comment>People like Karat and Yechury can never revive this party. They can take whatever consolation they want in JNU and keep spoiling the lives of young students.</comment>

<comment>First post, the  only pro terror, anti India media available right now !!!</comment>

<comment>Last ditch attempt by the Left to revive itself to no avail.... Rot in peace, dear commies!</comment>

<comment>Look who is talking -  so students stop asking questions, lose their scientific temperament and freedom to express their views. They want finish off India’s 3500 year old culture of wisdom that was developed through discourse and respecting democratic views.The disciple of Chinese Communist Party :))))</comment>

<comment>Left politicians really need to come up with something positive and new for the development of the country. Instead of agitating against the JNU issue how about doing your job in the Parliament to discuss, debate and pass important bills like GST, Bankruptcy Bill, Real Estate Regulation Bill, etc. This will really help honest, common citizens of India. You will win genuine respect of the people for helping build a great nation - INDIA.</comment>

<comment>Its a great strategy by BJP if this incident is able to revive Left....Bcaz if the Left revives, it will revive in the anti-BJP space, which means the biggest losers will be Cong., TMC, etc....Not the BJP.....Great strategy!!</comment>

<comment>By following RSS agenda BJP is fast losing its vote bank...No wonder Communist parties are trying to gain momentum....Many of them will benefit from the ANTI BJP hate wave....</comment>

<comment>It's not by following RSS agenda, but by the heinous politics played by Scamgresss party and its allies !!! Lol</comment>

<comment>Brahmin yechury wants to fool dalits.  No more sir </comment>

<comment>Is he Brahmin?</comment>

<comment>Ask yechury or see yourself how many Dalits have in their communist leadership. They talk of dalits all time but do not elect or give chance to dalits. That is the hypocrisy. When Vemula n students asked him in university, he said we cannot find talented and suitable people. Read some posts of Vemula where he also blames communist yechury and INC too. Today same parties are trying hard to cash on him, to hide their own names.</comment>

<comment>Dalits not able to understand the comrades game...</comment>

<comment>all their top leadership is.</comment>

<comment>Jai bhim?  What has the left ever done for dalits? "left parties are dead,  didi will bury them this time. </comment>

<comment>If the economic policies are not designed to also take along the poor then any other party will surely spring from. If thinking about the poor and marginalized sections of the population from the rich bullies then there will always be area for dissent. This is nothing new in history. Revolutions take place when there is an obscene gulf of difference between the haves and have nots one witnesses a phenomenon that the world does not expect. Why India alone, this revolution will take place in the Arab world too where the top cream lives like kings and the rest just obedient goats</comment>

<comment>silently middle class educated distanced from left party...now it is orphan and cheerleader of congress party....</comment>

<comment>These good for nothing commie pigs can do nothing productive. They are free-loaders eating away the tax money of hard working India working class.</comment>

<comment>Good for nothing - but you got your Independence for Netaji Subhash Bose,Chandra Shekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh who were all leftists and socialists. Bhagat Singh was Communist party member. RSS was then spying for the Brits.</comment>

<comment>you just tell me why this agitation is going on and these comrades giving support to them?what is the leftist ideology?</comment>

<comment>Vinay, I wish you read Kanhayia's full speech. Most left ( including CPI and CPIM) never support Afjal Guru, they support other mainstream political parties on Kashmir issue. These are all doctoral students in the finest university without any quota and almost all are from lower/middle class.. They are arrested by using doctored video, photo shop and false propaganda as ABVP wants to gain control in these Unis.We all see the so called law officers of Delhi brutally assaulted these students and teachers/ ordinary people. Now the prosecution will drag the case every stage for these students and will ruin the careers of these students, though all the lawyers are not at all arrested ( 1 arested but immediately got bail). You don't know Vinay, it may happen any day to your friend and families.</comment>

<comment>“	First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me. ” German poem during Nazi Germany.</comment>

<comment>yes, have read them. you know who came: Stalin , Mao. what were they? just guess.</comment>

<comment>Seriously you read his speech? Please try to be honest atleast to yourself. Go to 16th Feb Telegraph and read the full speech.</comment>

<comment>JNU agitation has sounded death knell for the commies.</comment>

<comment>Not only Commies, opposition is completely united now, even BSP and BJD. Again, LJP (NDA partner) is supporting the commies. Not only this, BJP intelligentsia Soli Sorabjee, Meghnad Desai are supporting the JNU students.</comment>

<comment>I though it is a 'faking news'. But guys this is really serious.</comment>

<comment>Yea right why don't you first tell the world that you have never won a single election!</comment>

<comment>Leftist ideology is a primitive concept which has ceased to exist in all  over globe. Those who have it for namesake are also practicing Capitalism.YOU ARE DOOMED!!</comment>

<comment>I have traveled at least 30 countries, I saw considerable number of leftists in every country. Few examples UK opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn and US senator ( Presidential candidate) Bernie Sandars.</comment>

<comment>The writer of the column is in all probabilities a Leftist from WB. Hoping that the left parties winn. Elections are coming. Please wait for results.</comment>

<comment>Left is always a serious abnormalities of brain , therefore  right is always right</comment>

<comment>BJP [See Khattar’s statement]is anti National as it wants to give reservations to Jats at the expense of merit seats without disturbing OBC Quota]. BJP is anti-national. What MORAL right does left have to function in a multi party democracy when they are for single party dictatorship? Have left students forgotten Polpot Stalin who crushed INDIVIDUALS for building collective? Left is anti-human.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What if the state is captured by a mob? India is a Ocholocracy [mob rule] as Individual rights( like merit) is murdered, by definition, as by reservation policy and Individual right of property rights are murdered by Socialism. Will you call Jats who destroyed an entire state as anti-National? Will you call kapus anti-National as they burnt a train. Reservation agitation is action as compared to just hot air of sloganeering [logically punishment should also be hot air]. VP Singh has made constitution anti-national and Modi I suspect will bring private sector reservations to become another VP Singh----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------No Support to Khalid. Kanhaiya Kumar is different as he is not a member of communist Democratic Students Union which is for the murder of Individual rights and is for collectivism. Communists support reservation policy, which is murder of Individual right of merit and also are for demolishing property rights another important Individual right.Kanhaiya Kumar as PM!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------However Let us examine Sedition laws------------------------------------1)Law of Vikamaditya: A prostitute hears a Brahmin who says to his friend that she had appeared in the Brahmins man's dreams and she was wonderful. The Prostitute drags the Brahmin to Vikramaditya for her fees. Vikramaditya hangs a bag of Gold and asks the prostitute to get her fees from the MIRROR. If service is virtual reward is also virtual. In sedition laws if the 'crime' is talking then the punishment should also be 'talking'2)USA Laws protect a person who burns the National Flag as the crime is CONSIDERED virtual and is not action. State acts when the 'crime' is in action3)In Kedar Nath Singh’s Case, 5 judges of the Supreme Court – a Constitution bench – made it clear that allegedly seditious speech and expression may be punished only if the speech is an ‘incitement’ to ‘violence’, or ‘public disorder’. Subsequent cases have further clarified the meaning of this phrase. In Indra Das v. State of Assam and Arup Bhuyan v. State of Assam, the Supreme Court unambiguously stated that only speech that amounts to “incitement to imminent lawless action” can be criminalised.There is a flaw in the LOGIC  of supreme court. How can an INDIVIDUAL be punished for the actions of the mob - particularly when India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] as the reservation policy agitation of Kapus and Jats showed. IS IT THE FAULT OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAT INDIA HAS BECOME EXPLOSIVE? HOW SHOULD THE INDIVIDUAL KNOW IN ADVANCE if a situation will explode? The faulty logic of mixed economy[read article on mixed economy down below] and acts of VP Singh, which made the constitution anti-National. Indira Gandhi has made the constitution anti-national by inserting socialism[as by definition legal robbery, as distinct from charity and implies forceful SNATCHING]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arun SHourie put the problem in two words Present BJP govt is congress+cow. He implied Modi has been a failure. Failed persons in politics can be dangerous. I strongly suspect that he will try to bring in private sector reservations and try to become another VP SIngh, who made the constitution anti-national along with Indira Gandhi when she inserted legal robbery of socialism into constitution.--------------------------------------------------------------------The solution is to test PM on the basis of  MERIT. He has not been proactive. I had recommended, earlier:Now BJP/RSS should be creative, PROACTIVE, and bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics. USA experience shows that goons kill each other in presence of free gun laws. None will kill with a legal weapon.2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=========================================================Mixed economy is a fascist economy. Bureaucracy/mafia politician becomes the supreme arbiter. Consider reservation policy: The only work of a government is protection of Individual rights - Jefferson, 2nd president of USA.. President of India as head of state has to commit suicide as merit, an Individual right, is murdered by reservation policy. The state is duty bound to protect Individual from mobs. Such arguments are not answered but ignored -- what the state does is right. Nazism was stateism like socialism. Those who could obtain power could justify state-sponsored murder and plunder by pointing out that since morals don't really exist and are merely a product of one's class or upbringing, there is no moral argument against the state version of murder and plunder.Socialism introduced into constitution during emergency is legal robbery. Way forward is capitalism[another name of freedom]Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim’s gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of money taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials and mafia politicians.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, but that it cannot be used honestly.Why does not the state allot a seat strictly on merit and snatch it away OPENLY?Gandhian Socialism of BJP is Gandhiism [selling of ones supporters to gain support of Jinnah and Muslims and Socialism is legal robbery]======================================================Only action hurting the nation is prevented by state in USA. Even burning of National flag is taken as talk and government protects the Individual right to do so.</comment>

<comment>Yes, they have got a chance by burying their head deep inside sand and pretend like they are ruling the world with their @$$ open for public!</comment>

<comment>Mr. Ghose, Just do some research on communism in india before giving a title "left gets a chance to revive". At independence communists were the biggest challengers to congress, they were spread throughout the country, their leaders came from the length and breadth of the country unlike now confined to 2 states. The movement was mass based on real issues, their leaders survived on hand to mouth existence from the contributions of the party. Their downfall began in 80s when they started distancing from the masses and become sloganeering leaders. No communist leader of the 50s spoke about secularism, but was secular to the core. Today all they speak is secularism but totally anti-hindu. No party can grow with such blind hatred to the majority community.</comment>

<comment>Left imagines that it has got a Fresh Chance.  But then, it is again mistaken.</comment>

<comment>Not a single penny I am benefited out of my tax money, in my daily life, I pay toll for road apart from road tax, I pay tax out of fuel, my kids are in private schools by force (yes, why would I choose a very high tuition fees, if the govt facility is good, I pay for food and food bill has 14% tax, luxury tax, a/c charges apart, neither vegetables are not cheep nor oil and dhal can be bought less than Rs 500/kg, slat and sugar cost has grown 4 times, gold rate is at peak, real estate can be dreamt, entertainment tax, property tax, wealth tax, professional tax, income tax, no gas subsidy, no road safety, no life insurance, no pension. If I have to make everything for my own, why the hell should I need a pay so much in taxes and other indirect taxes for the govt only to run a crap institution for free of cost and you politicians have avenues to thrive on politics on my money? And that's the single reason people make black money and that sets stage for other truthful citizens to be otherwise as well.</comment>

<comment>Indian communist parties are disgrace to communism ideology itself.They themselves are the worst kind of casteist(& racist) with paternalistic attitude towards lower castes.For them,lower castes cannot fight on their own and need support of upper caste elites.They dont have even a single lower caste member in their polit bureau and never had any lower caste supremo and talk about BJP as casteist which has lower caste person as PM!And make no mistake,so called dalit ki beti Mayawati herself belongs to Jatav,counted as upper caste among Dalits,and has no leader from real untouchable communities!These parties only exploit lower castes and reduce a man identity to his caste(just as Rohith wrote in his suicide letter).They reduce every suicide into Dalit discrimination case,even when Rohit was not a Dalit by any stretch.</comment>

<comment>2010, a platform called ‘JNU Forum Against War on People’ constituted of Democratic Students Union (DSU) and All India Students Association (AISA) held a meeting in JNU, soon after the April 2010 Maoist attack in Dantewada, which led to killing of 76 CRPF policemen.Saket Bahuguna, the Delhi State Secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, (ABVP) had commented on the happening:“I was witness to the All India Students Association (linked to the CPI-ML Liberation) and the (pro-Maoist) Democratic Students Union celebrating the killing of CRPF jawans by Maoists.”Incidentally Congress was the rulling party at centre then. JNU had then seen a joint condemnation of the Leftist activities, both by ABVP and NSUI.To oppose the holding of the function, NSUI and ABVP activists took out a march to the venue where a clash broke out among the students.interestingly, the issue had brought arch-rivals ABVP and NSUI together, against DSU and AISA.A NSUI National General Secretary had said then, “Members of Democratic Students Union (DSU) and All India Students Association (AISA) organized a meeting to celebrate the killing of 76 CRPF personnel in Chhattisgarh. They were even shouting slogans like ‘India murdabad, Maovad zindabad’. How can this be allowed inside a Central UniversityRead more... Article by deb basu...
