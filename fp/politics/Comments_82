<comment>His time is spent in fighting Modi/BJP and going to Bihar ,Hyderabad, Punjab etc.While he crticises Modihe follows Modi by going everywhere but without doing any work.</comment>

<comment>This is apaid article  by a so called author. only 2 auto drivers out of  80000 have complaints and this congi supporter author has made it as if all auto wallahs are against AK.AK's govt has already constructed 2200 Auto stands and  another 1000 are in progress. the remaining  is heldup because DDA under BJP is not giving land. AK has kept all his promises and still there are a few ungrateful autowallahs and they are  projected as  if they are the majority.</comment>

<comment>it does really seem...IN FP ITSELF IN ANOTHER ARTICLE THEY SAID 97% AAP VOTERS STILL SUPPORT KEJRIWAL!!...aur yaha aese...jhoot ka bhi koi hadd hota he.</comment>

<comment>He is too busy trying to be national leader going to Hyderabad or Bihar etc! What a fool he has made of all people. I used to be his staunch supporter once.</comment>

<comment>Indian economy ke saath feku ki bhi lagi hui hai isliye tum log apni doobti nayiya ko kisi tarah sambhalne ki koshish kar rahe ho.</comment>

<comment>Oh dear he has only time to dream of the next raid on his chamchas. Remember he  predicted the raid on Siss0dia?</comment>

<comment>Delhites are truly 'The Twice Fooled'.</comment>

<comment>who else is left ,muslims ,auto walas , aapturds all are disillusioned</comment>

<comment>526 Crore public money being used for shameless self-promotional activities. No real development activity nothing.Well,how can he spare time for that,when he is indulging in countless nautankis!.</comment>

<comment>LOL Muslims are complaining. Autowallahs are complaining. MCD workers are complaining. Who is the one not complaining? Answer - The paid trolls working overtime in AAP Trolling Center!</comment>

<comment>BJP defeated Congress and AAP defeated both Bongress.</comment>

<comment>LOL ... next time it will most likely be 70 out of 70 for AAP in Delhi. Mark my words. Before that in Punjab you'll witness another episode.</comment>

<comment>These Bhakts are diabolic, ask any Bhakt of Modi's achievement as PM after approximate 2 years in office, they will immediately counter, stating that 'be patient, Rome was not built in a day, give him time, after all he has to set right the rot of last 70 years governance. Similarly', why do not Bhakts give the same benefit to AK the anarchist who has only completed 1 year in office, because they know that AK sticks like a soar thumb up Modi's behind.</comment>

<comment>well was the benefit of doubt given by  paid sickular trolls to NDA  , aap is hobnobbing with khalistan separatists n punjab , now in delhi they will support afzal guru's followeres of JNU  lol</comment>

<comment>Oh yes Kejriwal even met up with Bhindarwale when he was a class 8 student. Idiots!</comment>

<comment>not needed to meet a Bhindranwale , the idea of hobnobbing with one of B's chehlas is enough like the leftists hobnobbing with a mao zedong ,to make him pro khalistan ( meaning anti anti national )</comment>

<comment>Some auto-wallahs who were close to Kejru have become writers in F*P and other media outlets which benefit from the Rs 526 crore publicity fund, some became pAAPi trolls to write gibberish and fake-up-vote ! So obviously the remaining auto-wallahs are feeling disappointed !</comment>

<comment>Yes,Kejri has already taken them for a Royal Ride.</comment>

<comment>Can the reporters chase the politicians and include their response too? They should be answerable too</comment>

<comment>don't bother he will fool them again, and not only autowallahs but the dilliwallahs too.</comment>
