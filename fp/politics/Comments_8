<comment>Simply brilliant Anubhav...Congress has been systematically, diabolically and deliberately looting this country. It has always been a Con-gress, conning the nation and gullible people...Happy that it is now reduced to a 44 party with a few slaves still left crooning "Ma- Beta" ki Jai...Waiting for the day when it will be completely wiped off..</comment>

<comment>It feels like Headly is taking the Indian Govt. and court on a roller coaster ride of facts and fiction, wherein it will not be possible to dis-screen between facts and fiction, thus make fool of Indians. In fact American Govt. should grant Indian Investigation officers free access to interrogate Headly in the famed Indian style (like putting chilly powder in his pucker), rather than the American style (concession for confession), then only we will be able to see Headly spilling the actual beans and confessing profusely, receiving tit-bits of confusing information is painful rather than the whole story required to nail the culprit, else it seems like he is parroting. I think Modi should use the influence of his good office with the American Govt. and prove Indian-American relationship really mean business.</comment>

<comment>If he spills full beans,then we may learn Sonia maino had given the supari to LeT to bump off modi.</comment>
