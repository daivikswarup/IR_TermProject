<comment>GOOD JOB by author to sell Nitish Kumar as MR.Clean</comment>

<comment>Nitish is found washing dirt of Lalu & family he has no shame and this coward Chameleon is projected as leader</comment>

<comment>Chameleon cannot humble any one Narendra Modi is warrior not coward like Nitish, Modi will come back when opportunity arise, what you have seen is just semi final</comment>

<comment>How can anyone who sides with Lalu and RaGa, be labelled as "Mr. Clean"?</comment>

<comment>They use clean soap so every crime is suddenly washed away because media agents are paid in black</comment>

<comment>The choice for biharis was easy. Nitish the change maker vs modi the noise maker. </comment>

<comment>Or vote for the person from their caste</comment>

<comment>Lalu's sons will be handling Health Ministry & Infra Ministry... two of most cash cow ministries already under Lalu. Adding to this one of his son will be Deputy CM. Good going Mr. Laluji, aap ka to swag hai bhai.</comment>

<comment>Prashant kishore has started contributing to IANS too ???</comment>

<comment>Ha....ha...how stupid u are fp......</comment>

<comment>Mistakes of BJP made him win rather than his work,  Modi still Mr clean and he is doing good.  what changed is  RSS Reservation, Dadri, statements from BJP fundamentalist , cow, price of daal.   Now even  Congress CMs say "Cow slaughter have no right to leave in india"  but it not big news as it is not said by BJP.  AK/RG hugs and shares stage with lalu but not big hallagulla.  RG and AK refused to share stage with lalu before.  AK has to appreciates yadav sons as Dy CM/cabinate minister.   Against congress opposition unite based corruption, price rice , economy but now no corruption cases, price rise is down ( of course some seasoned food items may go up) . Now they unite just to oppose Modi and  for their political survival.</comment>

<comment>I dont think people of Bihar are bothered about Dadri or Beef thing. BJP did biggest mistake by not having local candidate as CM face. Prime Minister is not supposed to go to every state and beg for votes of electing a local govt.  Biharis still would vote for Modi in national election but BJP was choking their local aspirations. Over doing Modi magic and over confidence of Amit Shah costed them elections.</comment>

<comment>that could also  one of the point,  as soon as  Bihar election was over  intolerance vanished. Local leaders like Paswan maunji and kushwar ,  could make any impact , they won 3/85 seats allotted to them</comment>

<comment>It is not Clean Nitish but Corrupt Lalu who humbled Modi. Lets give credt to the devil. Lalu for next PM.</comment>

<comment>Jungle Raj 2.0......Nitish Kumar is being sworn in as Forest Officer of the Jungle and not Chief Minister.</comment>

<comment>After laloo, there was no bar for Nitish to measure up to and so his actions appeared 'revolutionary'.Still congrats to him, as a politician, he played his cards well and won. But time will tell whether the win was worth it. As I noted before the results came out, regardless of the overall outcome Laloo will get more seats. Now, with Laloo family literally surrounding him, it's going to be blackmails galore, and surely many scams are in the offing.As for Bihar, it will go to dogs when jungle raj II is unleashed.</comment>

<comment>LOL time will tell? Was 4 terms as CM not enough?</comment>

<comment>4 terms? where was he CM for 4 terms? Even the 2 terms he was CM he had BJP as an equal partner. So by any logical reasoning, it remains to be seen if he can provide the same level of performance with Lalu and his his family as partners. He may be able to or he may not, only time will tell. As a supporter, its your wish to think whatever rosy picture you want. But by any objective analysis, this is an untested combination, one with a good track record (albeit with BJP as a partner), and Lalu and family with a horrific record.</comment>

<comment>Your logical reasoning doesn't let you see that 4 terms, 2 which were with BJP in alliance was STILL not good enough to provide conclusive results. Why is that difficult to get in to your thick skull that the voters of Bihar chose him as their CM 5 times in a row?</comment>

<comment>again asking...what were the 4 terms? looks like you are in it for only abusing and not for any reasoned debates based on data. In any case, the debate is not in Nitish's ability to be a reasonably good leader, he is a good guy, there's no doubt about it and that's why his relationship with the BJP lasted for almost 20 years. Its about his ability to do provide governance of the same level in armlock with Lalu.</comment>

<comment>Instead of blindly parroting FP, can you tell us what were the 4 terms? </comment>

<comment>Pity on people's who voted on the lines of caste</comment>
