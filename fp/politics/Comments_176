<comment>congress is gone, but those local officials are still around, no doubt collecting more bribes.</comment>

<comment>There are enough Indians who are fools and want to vote for the congress even now. All these so called "writers" and "intellectuals" are in the pockets of the corrupt congress party. No wonder , they have suddenly woke up to the incidents of law and order.None of these pseudo seculars ever say a word about those incidents when a Hindu is killed by the muslims.</comment>

<comment>In India, You are Secular if You are a Muslim.AndYou are a Communal if You even Talk about a Hindu..... or Hinduism,</comment>

<comment>Has Anyone Ever Considered the Following Questions?1. What has been the Livelihoods Opportunity / Income Generating Activity of Mother (So Ga) and Son (Ra Ga)?2. What is the Source of Income for the Duo to Afford a Luxurious and Princely Lives such as Frequent Foreign Holidays, Five star Cultures etc?3. It is a fact that except the Salary and Perks Received as Parliamentarians, they probably receive a Paltry Family Pension of the Late Prime Minister (RG). There could also be some Income received out of Previous Investments that were made by the Elder Generation of Late Prime Ministers (RG / IG / JN) in the Family.However, with High Inflation across multiple decades even such investments could have dried up, but then ...... ...... Appreciate Enlightening.(Any Takers)?</comment>

<comment>That question could also be asked of most politicians what the people don't get is the country is continuously looted, it doesn't matter which party is in power! </comment>

<comment>"In 2012, Wal-Mart disclosed that it had spent $25 million over a span of four years to lobby US lawmakers to help it gain access to foreign markets including India"Where is really corruption involved here in India  when such lobbying through money power  by Multi National Giants are quite common all over the Globe ? Infact this relates to Walmart fiercely lobbying only with US law makers being consciously aware of the American influence over Indian Government's economic policies and this stays true even today or else why there is a need for allowing 100% FDI in Defence ??Even in Mexico, there were disclosures of  massive allegations of bribery by Walmart  to the Policy makers there as well as  massive amount of misappropriation in Walmart Malls  ?  Similar allegations are rampant in USA, Argentina, Spain and many other Countries where these Multi National Giants have set up their shops !!What is of course proven by this revelation is the fact that India has become a true Banana Republic where its policy makers have become subservient and  servile to the Imperialist USA  and have literally become  their stooges implementing financial policy decisions favouring  USA's  financial market and not devised  in Country's interest  !!</comment>

<comment>Only Dirty Pigs like can justify corruption !!!!</comment>

<comment>Trying to justify the rampant corruption of your masters?</comment>

<comment>yeah beating around the bush as always like the indian media</comment>

<comment>It will be interesting to know how many if those who have commented have never given bribes at any level! Our systems are so defective and delaying that unless some strict measures are taken, to talk if  aclean system is wishful</comment>

<comment>It is a known fact that at the lower level there is corruption  just in the UPA regime but continues even today!! Can the BJP spokesman give details of what measures this Govt has taken that these lower level officers in Customs etc are not taking any bribes now. Traditional officials at many lower levels continue to take bribes and unless conctete measures are taken it will continue.</comment>

<comment>a 60 year old habit cannot change overnight , wonder where were you when this was happening under the UPA and why did you not ask the then govt ,</comment>

<comment>Please desist d from making personal remarks. I have travelled several timnes and have never never paid any bribe but have declared all my goods honestly. The difference is one is assuming that just because Mr Modi is honest,honesty has become the norm. Sorry. It is not a question of 6 years but the mindset. I have been given personal instances of corruption and bribery being prevalent in Gujarat when MOdi was CM.</comment>

<comment>Now we know which party is in bed with the corporates (not that there was any doubt). Shameless hypocrite CONgis.</comment>

<comment>When "Con" is part of Congress what else can we expect, Corruption is a synonym for CONgress.</comment>

<comment>100% right congress is corrupt but why modi is sending them to jail ?</comment>

<comment>well Mod i does not have 370 pages of proof of corruption , its with Khujli and khujli is not working with centra;l govt and handing over the file of 370 pages of corruption proof against sheila ( just an example )</comment>

<comment>Talk about Sheila man</comment>

<comment>Congress really believes in non-aligned movement initiated by Nehru - bribes from across the globe without discrimination!!</comment>

<comment>will prestitute media question Sonia and Rahul moron Gandhi now !!!!</comment>

<comment>Distilled idiot and egregious liar,Do not pollute this forum with your quarter baked knowledge !!</comment>

<comment>Why abuse him? Because he dared to question your masters over credible bribery revelations? I guess only RaGa and Soga have the right to make an issue over trumped up corruption charges. </comment>

<comment>Dirty Pig , don't spam the forum with shitty brain !</comment>

<comment>for many years to come we will have to keep filling the pit UPA dug us into</comment>

<comment>considering the  huge npas created  by giving  taxpayers  money to congress leaders relatives , its almost impossiblesonia + pawar  destroyed the foundations  of infrastructure  ,agriculture  ,banking  ....</comment>

<comment>600 mines allotted by BJP in Rajasthan revokedBoB, govt bank, involved in 6000 crore black money scamVyapam scam where accused die almost dailyAll this in 1 year of BJP filling the pit... I dread the effects at the end of 5 years</comment>

<comment>oh is it m vyapam was started in Diggi raja , 6000 crores - well started in 2006 and was found by this govt in 1 year or so , we are more concerned about the effects of the vaticano rule , 3000 christian organisations were running their show with impunity in andhrapradesh alone , they did not file returns of money spent as per law , which they got from west . all those has been involved in land grab , thankfully that was shut down by this govt</comment>

<comment>LOL, vyapam? The scam started by the CONgress govt and exposed after an investigation ordered  by the BJP CM, is a BJP scam for you? Brainless morons.</comment>

<comment>Is that the reason why RSS worker Anand Rai, who filed the PIL, felt abandoned by RSS? Is that the reason why he filed case against BJP leader Vikram Verma. When an RSS worker files case against BJP leaders, you do not need to be a rocket scientist to make the correct inference.</comment>

<comment>well he was purchased by congress to file the RTI</comment>

<comment>which mines are revoked , coal mines were allocated by central govt</comment>

<comment>Google 'Rajasthan mine scam'</comment>

<comment>The Rajasthan anti-corruption bureau's covert operation to bust the mining scam was kept secret from the state government, including chief minister  and home minister Gulab Chand Kataria. Sources in the government told TOI that the operation was carried out at the behest of the PMO.The ACB had on Wednesday arrested 1983 batch IAS officer and state mining secretary Ashok Singhvi and seven others and seized over Rs 4 crore from different locations. The ACB was acting on state mining lobby's report to the PMO and BJP president Amit Shah six months back about being fleeced by officialswell FYI , it was not by ministers  but an IAS officer , he has been caught , and it was done by PMO , wonder where were you when officials were acting on their own under PMO - coal gate , hardly any official was caught, and you are calling the action against corrupt corruption lol</comment>

<comment>Is that why allocation for 601 mines were cancelled? For a scam of 4 crore?</comment>

<comment>lols , read paper , first and stop  barking blindly , the scam was there in the single window system which was being managed by 1 person( an IAS officer )  who was corrupt , and he may have made some decisions under the influence of bribe , so the licences are cancelled . well at least khujli did not do anything like this, sorry news just in , he has taken over the wakf board , lols , now we will see the sickulars singing( burning ) his back side lol, w</comment>

<comment>The papers say that LokAyukta will investigate while Congress demanded CAG investigation. It is ridiculous to claim that only 1 IAS officer was responsible for allocation of more than 600 mines and that he was interested in a paltry bribe of 4 crore (which is the cost of a 2bhk in a city like Bombay). What will happen is that the IAS officer will be made a sacrificial lamb while the government wiggles out.Even if I accept your argument that only the IAS officer was guilty, how is it different from the UPA govt? No one has proven/alleged that MMS took bribes. The complaint was that UPA was not competent because there was corruption when UPA was in power. By the same logic, the Rajasthan govt is incompetent.Even if the LokAyukta finds the Rajasthan govt to be involved in corruption, you can say that the LokAyukta is an agent of Pakistan or Vatican.</comment>

<comment>lol , what is the meaning of single window , anyway has it not occured to your moronic brain that if the xtian media is not talking about it there is nothing , u are taking the discussion to beyond your evangelical powers of persuasion of trying to convince others about a non existent scam where in scams occured in the house of minister under maino rule</comment>

<comment>I do not know what a single window is. It is something you created out of thin air. If the Rajasthan government decisions are taken by IAS officers through single Windows, what is the govt doing?And, if you assign the allocation of mines to 1 IAS officer, without any collective responsibility, how do you detect corruption? Don't make up claims and expect me to believe it. Only Modi supporters can believe ridiculous stories.</comment>

<comment>done by whom , minister or IAS officer ( looks like you are not reading But commenting blindly against BJP ) the same if khujli does u will be licking his @$$</comment>

<comment>So, In Rajasthan, are all decisions taken by IAS officers. So, the BJP govt is busy helping Lalit Modi?</comment>

<comment>decision s taken by govt , not implemented properly by IAs officers and who misuse their positions to grant favours need to be dealt with , which was done appropriately so a fresh process has to be started again as it may have been flawed by the IAs officer . looks like u are the only one talking about it , surprisingly no khujliwal or lallo are any other sickular chutes or CHOOTIYIS ( female version if you are one )are talking about it , it shows your xtian mind set . well regarding helping lalit modi ( not sure if interpol is under indian govt ) it was another sham stalling parliament  as u  guys weren't able to prove that money exchanged hands FYI , but in 2 G and coal gate , it was in maino/'s chuterather than play to galleries by saying corruption is most prevalent in delhi police ( but have a sugar and onion scam done by themselves ), why don;t you research on onion scam and come up with some good sound bytes . if not happy why not research for the father of your religion founder , u will spend your life more meaningfully</comment>

<comment>What was the decision taken by the govt? If the government does not have a procedure after all the controversies, what is the guarantee that the government will have a solution now? If mines are to be repeatedly reallocated, why would anyone even bother to bid for them.</comment>

<comment>You are wasting your time with this Moron. He doesn't even understand simple English !!</comment>

<comment>Haha you have just turned out to be another garden variety hater. What's wrong in the refutations and facts shared by Sachayee? Stop random abuses.</comment>

<comment>and u guys hardly read news papers , all u want is something against  hindus and u will keep up the news that it is because of modi lol. </comment>

<comment>all useless points. In half off the cases BJP has nothing to do with it (vyapam, BoB? seriously) and in other half there is no corruption (mine allocation)</comment>

<comment>If BJP has nothing to do with vyapam, why did RSS worker Anand Rai, who filed the PIL, feel abandoned by RSS? Is that the reason why he filed case against BJP leader Vikram Verma. When an RSS worker files case against BJP leaders, you do not need to be a rocket scientist to make the correct inference.If BJP has nothing to do with BoB black money, the congress has nothing to do with the telecom scam either. But, when scams happen under a govt, it is the govt's responsibility.Google Rajasthan mine scam</comment>

<comment>so what? He may be a black sheep. May be d0gvijay bought him over</comment>

<comment>Then, why can't BJP complete the investigation and arrest the accused. Can't you think before posting?</comment>

<comment>i don't want BJP to investigate. I want a professional force to investigate. And BJP has got CBI to investigate this</comment>

<comment>lols he was purchased by congress</comment>

<comment>Then, why can't BJP complete the investigation and arrest the accused?</comment>

<comment>lols again , not as rich as congress , to repurchase him , 3,75 lakh crores from just 2 scams well that is a lot of money</comment>

<comment>You don't need to be rich to complete the investigation of the Vyapam scam</comment>

<comment>cannot beat the price mate , they are a super rich themselves , national herald properties worth 1800 crores usurped by first family of congis by paying just 50 lakhs and the SIL made 5 lakhs into 300crores in just 2 years , see sickular xtian brains at work , cannot beat them , anyway CBI is still finished the 2G cases due to stalling by the sickulars</comment>

<comment>What price are you talking about? Why does anyone need money to complete the investigation? Or, are the investigators asked to go slow/soft like the prosecutor Rohini Salian in the Malegaon bombing case?Regarding CBI, I thought the BJP's claim was that the CBI is controlled by the party in power. Isn't the BJP in power?</comment>

<comment>25$ million seems to be very less for congress , since Congress made 10 lakh crores in coal scam !!!</comment>

<comment>agreed mate , maybe thats the reason why they did not get permission</comment>

<comment>Distilled idiot and egregious liar,Do not pollute this forum beyond redemption with your zilch knowledge !!</comment>

<comment>Dirty Pig , don't spam the forum with shitty brain</comment>

<comment>Distilled idiot and egregious liar - a contagious product of HIV and VD -  How is life worshipping p1gs ? Don't shove yr st1nking  sh1_t  complemented with butler english in this forum.  It is really nauseating and you deserve to be lynched first !!</comment>

<comment>Aids Moron go ask ur mom where she got disease from</comment>

<comment>I would much rather 'get bad name for corruption' than a bad name for killing people for meat in their fridge, bad name for foolish beliefs that an animal is mother/God, foolish ideas to start institutions to research bullshit and urine, etc. etc. etc.I would much rather be a corrupt country on the road to becoming a developed nation than a corrupt country (prominent builder commits suicide due to corruption) trying to become Pakistan.</comment>

<comment>What about Jesus bringing a dead man alive, Moses partying the sea, Jesus ascending to heaven in physical form after crucifixion, angel Gabriel whispering Quran to Muhammed, Muhammed being last prophet ever to be sent by god.....are all these foolish beliefs too?Blo*dy intolerant fanatic.</comment>

<comment>All religious beliefs are just that... Beliefs. If there was proof, it would not be called belief</comment>

<comment>Are they "foolish" beliefs or not? That was my question.</comment>

<comment>When beliefs are contrary to clear, practical facts and when they are imposed on others, it is foolish.For instance, if I believe that the earth is flat (in spite of the fact that it is round and if it were flat, we would fall off the edge), it is foolish. Also, if I were to ban air travel due to my belief that the earth is flat, it would become ridiculous. And, the cow beliefs are ridiculous.Most beliefs, without proof, can be called foolish. If there is no proof, why believe?</comment>

<comment>Are they "foolish" beliefs or not?</comment>

<comment>All religions were used to control and dominate people in the olden days, today politicians have taken over. </comment>

<comment>killing like 1984, kokrajhar, dhule riots?</comment>

<comment>Those killings were bad too. But, it was not part of a strategy like the current environment created by RSS </comment>

<comment>lol , so everything is like ! RSS is doing it ,but  the church attacks ? was it sponsored by church itself to score a point ( maybe ) through fellow sickulars , this one is enough to prove what you guys are - shame that church sponsors fellow sickulars to rape on of its 58 year old nun</comment>

<comment>Of course. RSS wants a country similar to Pakistan, with a saffron flag and Manusmriti as the constitution. To fulfill their plans, they will destroy India</comment>

<comment>lol again , its not doing it , is a media sickular hype and can be proven , media highlights only Muslims get killed and does not write when muslims kill hindus , so muslims are also killing in saffron India ( according to you )</comment>

<comment>The media is sickular when they report incidents across the country. But the same media was good when they reported the 2G scam or the coal scam. They wee good when they made live telecast of Anna Hazare's protests. Yet, they refuse to report the protest of the Patidars in Gujarat or the protest of OROP across the country.The media has been sidekick of the BJP since the BJP paid them millions for the shining India ads.</comment>

<comment>lol again , they would not have reported 2G if not for subramaniam swamy , anyway now you agree Media was paid 530 crores from Delhi govt + the so called western donors to talk against this govt</comment>

<comment>What has swamy to do with the media? Is swami the owner of all media houses? Has he instructed them to avoid reporting on Patidars and OROP protests?</comment>

<comment>then u shd go to pakistan.  ur wish will be fulfilled.</comment>

<comment>Pakistan prefers religion and hence is a dump. BJP / RSS are trying hard to drag India to the same level.</comment>

<comment>you would happily consume the same shit when packed by a multinational company and charge you in USD with a celebrity endorsing it! look at the medical journals in the US instead of Barkha Dutt programs to enlighten yourself - there is life beyond the blog post!</comment>

<comment>??? I would never consume gomutra or bullshit nor encourage. And, no multinational company can pack/sell it as RSS / BJP have the patent for bullshit</comment>

<comment>Go to Pakistan. Your wish will be fulfilled.</comment>

<comment>no, my wish will not be fulfilled. I said I do not want to live with fools who prioritise religion over common sense.Pakistan prefers religion and hence is a dump. BJP / RSS are trying hard to drag India to the same level.</comment>

<comment>Do you like a bad name for worshiping a Pedophile and keeping women in black bin bags?</comment>
