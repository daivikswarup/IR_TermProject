<comment>Huh? What's the purpose of this article? I mean what schmuck came up with this topic? I only read a few paras of the article and I am still trying to swim out of this Bermuda triangle of rubbish! </comment>

<comment>Kejriwal (with fractured powers), is Doing so  much good work what No other CM has EVER DONE in so less time, with so much finesse... POST INDEPENDENCE !!I bet on him... NO OTHER PARTY will be able to form Govt in Delhi for ATLEAST NEXT 10-15 YEARS !!Hope other CMs n Govts too take a Lesson from AAP !!</comment>

<comment>No other party will form a government... how? Jhootbolwal will capture booths?He is irrelevant: he will not give growth, and demonise the entrepreneur....</comment>

<comment>the existence of this creepy party is to remain permanently in news and there they seems to have succeded to some extend they are in news only for wrong reasons rape sexual harassment fraud etc not once over all these months have we heard anything positive about these louts</comment>

<comment>Are you speaking about BJP? Nihal Chand(Rape Accused), Sushma Swaraj, Vasundhara Raje, Nitin Gadkari (Fraud and Corruption)Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Amit Shah, Narendra Modi, Sangeet Som (Murder and Communal Riots)</comment>

<comment>Nope, he is speaking about aap, the langur arvind kejirwal, the sole heir to stalin and hitler..and the rest of the monkey gang, from khaitan to alka..</comment>

<comment>I did not realize that langur, monkeys were rapists, murderers, frauds etc. Did they also pull strings of Modi's pyjama? Saw him running naked in Delhi and Bihar.</comment>

<comment>I don't mean to offend you but with your level of intelligence you are qualified to spread ignorance! </comment>

<comment>Losing DUSU does not show you the writing on the wall yet? Get a better pair of eyes and while you are at it, a new brain as well..</comment>

<comment> Donot see youngsters r against aap  what is the result of dusu polls? I am 6/6 . Any way I can not hold my comments. i can not use personal accusations .still i am bound to my morals .  neither i am bjp supporter nor ur aap supporter. I want recalling power to kick out all these broom fellows from posts.</comment>

<comment>Well said. How stupid of me to not know that DUSU represent whole of Delhi. Why do we even have state elections in Delhi? We can use DUSU results to choose the MLA's.</comment>

<comment>DUSU REPRESENTS EDUCATED YOUNGSTERS</comment>

<comment>Bhai, are you also 8th pass like Modi himself?</comment>

<comment>IT SEEMS YOU ARE  PASSED NOTHING  EXCEPT YOUR TANTAMOUNT BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER CO OPINION SHARERS LIKE UR  AAP IDEOLOGY, killed in the bud stage  growth of aap in Maharashtra,  which resulted in Mayank Gandhi resignation who believed in aap morals. AT LEAST YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT YOUR CO OPINION HOLDERS R BRIGHTER THAN YOU IN THIS CONTEXT> YOU HAVE PHOBIA OF BELITTLING OTHERS. COME OUT OF THIS.</comment>

<comment>Good Analysis FirstPost. that too on a day when APP passed Citizen Charter, first time in India, govt official will be hold responsible for delay in delivery,</comment>

<comment>nothing analysed</comment>

<comment>Go Ahead. Do it now and highlight the mistakes or wrongs in the Citizen Charter. Who stops you from doing it now and spreading information about it? Opposition should have been there to ask questions and cross check, but they preferred to spend time abusing Women MLA instead of focusing on core issues and debating matters of importance.</comment>

<comment>what about mla of aap who misbehaved like samrat of India?</comment>

<comment>What has Citizen Charter to do with it? Looks like you do not have an argument left so you bring in anything unrelated to argue back. Citizen Charter is to help the people of state get a time bound service from government departments and so that no department can hold up there work for fictitious reasons and ask for bribe. You seem to be having serious problems with this bill. Are you working in a government department?</comment>

<comment>I HAVE ALREADY REPLIED TO U> IT IS FRIVOLOUS ATTEMPT TO CHANGE UR MINDSET</comment>

<comment>Achievements of aap, to date - None..</comment>

<comment>Did you just get out of Coma? How long were you lying in bed?</comment>

<comment>Additionally, care to also tell us about the lokpal bill? Sure, the check is in the mail and we would have to wait for eternity..pfft</comment>

<comment>Now I am absolutely sure you just came back from coma. Jan Lokpal Bill was passed by Delhi Assembly earlier this month.</comment>

<comment>lol i am talking about the real lok pal bill, not the dressed up one that lanur is humping about..</comment>

<comment>So what is the difference? Did you study it? Is that the same one which Congress and BJP called unconstitutional, the last time it was introduced in yr 2014? So when a strong bill is brought then your Idiot Modi and his bunch of jokers, along with all his bhakts like you beat there chest and cry that it is unconstitutional. When the Bill gets altered so that it can pass, then again idiots like you want to beat there chest and cry that it is a dressed up one. It is shocking to see people like you having fun about corrupt getting away and feeling depressed when a anti corruption bill is brought to catch them.</comment>

<comment>Did you and did you even pay attention to the various parts of it? And while you are at it, did you even consider the impact of this flawed bill and the indirect attack on our federalism? More to the point, please do not come back with "something is better than nothing" for with that moronic argument, we should all go down on our knees before kejriwal and thank him for being one of the most incompetent and inefficient cms to date since independence..Pffft</comment>

<comment>JAN LOKPAL BILL WHEN OWN PARTY LOKPAL WAS SACKED UNDEMOCRATICALLY. DO U STILL HOLD WILL IT BE IMPLEMENTED> IT IS ONLY FOR EYE WASH.</comment>

<comment>So there is no difference between party's internal lokpal and state's jan Lokpal Bill? Its funny that your own god Modi did not let one pass for 10 years and now you have a problem that Delhi assembly passed it within 9 months of coming to power, that too with a power to even prosecute the CM, in case of wrong doing. You might like to know that BJP MLA's gave a petition to LG requesting to not let this bill passed, while they were taunting AAP for not bringing the bill till last month.</comment>

<comment>ANY BLIND MAN CAN PASS WHEN MAJORITY IS THERE, LOL ,WHY HE TOOK 9 MONTHS , THAT IS CONDEMNABLE DO I LOOK LIKE 8TH PASS.  I ALREADY SAID I AM NOT SUPPORTER OF ANY PARTY , SO I SEE ALL DEFECTS . U WORE COLOR GLASSES OF AAP. HENCE U R ONE SIDED LIKE UR AK. HE FORGETS WHAT FOR HE IS CHOOSEN BUT CRITICIZES OTHERS LIKE HE IS SUPREMO OF UNWANTED PARTY.HE IS COMPARABLE WITH YRS PARTY JAGAN.</comment>

<comment>LOL, care to list out aap's achievements of which there are none and remember we are not talking about that langur's announcements but actual deliverables on the ground..Hare, this langur can spend five hundred and twenty crores on ads glorifying himself and yet cannot spend one INR on building nightshelters for the homeless and let''s not forget winter has already set in. Guess kejriwal and aap are just waiting for the corpses of the homeless to stack up so that they can snack on the same later on and play to the gallery..pathetic morons</comment>

<comment>A farmer committed suicide during the launch rally of the AAP over the anti-land acquisition ordinance protests but Arvind Kejriwal and his partymen kept on speaking, demanding from the Delhi Police that they come and rescue the man.....This speaks volumes about this man and his party workers who are intended to serve common man....I will never trust this man.....</comment>

<comment>Thousands of farmers are comitting suicide in Madhya pradesh and Maharastra. Does it speak anything about the leaders of party in these states or you exhausted all your literary capabilities reading volumes on Kejriwal?</comment>

<comment>This one is classic... He doesn't have humanity at all...he just ignored and continued his speech... If u can know the difference...</comment>

<comment>Of course. How could he allow the man to die? He should have ran towards the man and got him down, while ornamental Delhi police could stand there and watch the show. While we are at Humanity, how about also considering these dying farmers and there families, as humans too. I know that they are Anti-national, as they are trying to discredit a god like Modi.</comment>

<comment>You know something to save Gajendra he needed no power or authority!! Only presence of mind.. Which he and his party don't have...</comment>

<comment>His presence of mind and intelligence is causing upset stomach and loss of sleep for his detractors and there bhakts like you. Isn't that enough.</comment>

<comment>I don't think so....He is responsible for death of Gajendra...Since you can't defend him you are telling all this....</comment>

<comment>What about 2000 got roasted in Gujarat...with police force in his hand...Big Banana  in his mouth that time?</comment>

<comment>Right in front of this guy a person hangs himself, instead of rushing to him, he continued to speak....Not in history has any other politician witnessing suicide has sat without reacting and blaming police....This is his biggest mistake....may what u told must be in this guy's mouth and stop using that language ...</comment>

<comment>Blah..Blah..Blah.Once cant counter proper Chaddis will  start to act as Shakespeare or Milton</comment>

<comment>He is responsible for death of Gajendra.. That's the fact...</comment>

<comment>You Chaddi Gang leader is responsible Roasting 50 in train and 2000 outside in Gujarat</comment>

<comment>Gajendra could have been saved if this man had stopped his speech for few min...instead he chose to continue talking on dias and blaming others.. No moral responsibility... Should have resigned long back...</comment>

<comment>Chaddi Gang leader of Gujarat acted like a mute spectator when more than 2000 were roasted in Gujarat...Now his old girlfriend Maya Koda is convicted for Life imprisonment..Poor soul</comment>

<comment>Kujli an educated politicians makes talk claims about working for common man has no sensibility... A farmer died in front of him and he was watching... Shame on him</comment>

<comment>Gujarthi fekku...a chaiwalla always talk about Chai and dokkla..Instead of making Chai and Dokkla ...He roasted 2000 human lives...Kabab specialist...Great achiever</comment>

<comment>Kujli suicide specialist... Couldn't save a life how can he save India... He will watch everyone die</comment>

<comment>And Fekku is Kebab Tanddori Speaclist...couldnt save 2050..Ejoyed seeing them roasted</comment>

<comment>Kejri is bad at sports, he couldn't run and rescue...but he could have instructed his AAP volunteers to do...but he dint tell, he is insensible.. He watched a man die...it will haunt him for rest of his life....</comment>

<comment>Fekku worse  in every thing..except pampering Tulsi Pakisthani 56" and Noise pollution</comment>

<comment>AK witnessed Gajendra murder he is incapable and unfit to be a leader... Waste CM</comment>

<comment>Gajendra a poor farmer committed suicide right in front of AAP leader Kujli but did he care no, he was more interested in talking and shifting blame on Delhi police...atlast Ashutosh did a Oscar winning performance... What a shame , a party that came to limelight for helping common man ignored a death of farmer... Sheer lack of humanity</comment>

<comment>Chaddi Gang leader of Gujarat acted like a mute spectator when more than 2000 were roasted in Gujarat...Now his old girlfriend Maya Koda is convicted for Life imprisonment..Poor soul</comment>

<comment>What about 50 raosted in the compartment of a train which triggered that riot ? Non hindus have no shame.</comment>

<comment>Who was ruling India and Gujarat then?</comment>

<comment>Makes sense. Violence can only be answered by state sponsored violence, after all Rajeev Gandhi also did it and Modi being uneducated is learning from people who came before him.</comment>

<comment>Congratulations AAP for completly manifesting into a main stream political party by aligning with most corrupt in India... Way to go!!!!</comment>

<comment>Not completely. It has still not fallen to the levels of BJP and Congress. They are in the abyss.</comment>

<comment>AAP was supposed to be different now directed to abyss as other veteran parties....</comment>

<comment>Yet, you seem to dance and sing songs in praise of the parties which are in abyss and want to pull others along with them in it. Have you heard of Najeeb Jung, Delhi police, MCD etc?</comment>

<comment>AAP knew the power constraint in Delhi...but still went on made huge promises and when it got to know it won't work started blaming everyone and MODI in particular...</comment>

<comment>Here we are talking about agencies who are stopping the elected government to deliver governance to people and you want to play with legalise to justify incompetence and inefficiency of these agencies. At the same time, you are complaining that AAP is going in abyss for not delivering on its promises. Wow. I am impressed by your hypocrisy.</comment>

<comment>Hypocrite because I am calling a spade a spade....AAP is more dangerous than Congress and RJD...He did a sweet deal with Laloo by hugging him openly...</comment>

<comment>Writer must have been properly compensated  by AAP for writing such a misleading article.</comment>

<comment>Best thing will be to send him to Pakistan. He is a traitor and anti-national.</comment>

<comment>Baap Beti ki Sarkar (J&K), 15 Lakhs in everyone's account, Black Money returned in 100 days or hang me to death, Achey Din. Did Kejriwal spoke about and promise all this?</comment>

<comment>there was this stink for long in delhi dont know the reason why? were some one responsible on strike...</comment>

<comment>Modi had an upset stomach. MCD was busy sanitising Delhi from his stink.</comment>

<comment>how much do u get paid to s0ck aap's c0ck.. seeing that you have rebutted all of the aap against comments in this forum, i know that you are a paid flunky for aap</comment>

<comment>worse part would be teaming up with most corrupt political parties india has ever seen</comment>

<comment>Yes, BJP should not have supported PDB.</comment>

<comment>so you agree that AAP is nothing less than other parties</comment>

<comment>Supporting Nitish is definitely equivalent to forming government in J&K with PDB. There is no difference. Is it?</comment>

<comment>does nitish and lalu need any kind of support from aap to form govt? and compared to aap bjp they have just formed govt after fighting elections on their own priciples</comment>

<comment>aap is 9 months old....some govts are 18 months old..like nda.....let stalk o them</comment>

<comment>there is again the issue of farmer gajendra swinging from the tree as a prop</comment>

<comment>Ppl from North-East of India  usually cook &  eat up stray dogs ... like yourself</comment>

<comment>AAP has been following a great political program and no corruption cases yet although a bit of hypocrisy (all that crap about MLA salaries etc). All this has been admirable.Lalu hug is a non issue. What should he have done? Pushed away Lalu?But the biggest problem is moving away from inner party democracy. If kejriwal cannot live along with Yogendra Yadav, PB etc , how do we trust him to manage people at a bigger level. We do not want one of more  v centralized administration with just one top leader.</comment>

<comment>kejriwal is the next PM in 2019. Mark my words you bahen ke laudon </comment>

<comment>he cant, mark my words dear friend.</comment>

<comment>The facts that AAP has brought in a politics of the common man by the common man from outside the established system, created its foundation on the basis of anti corruption movement, involved the lower and middle classes majorly in Delhi and Punjab, has focused on civic amenities putting 25% of budget on education and 13% on health in Delhi, has brought in the culture of civic consultation in spending development funds, has brought in services guarantee act and next will come Janlokpal act in Delhi, and has taken steps on combatting corruption in governance and society: will be crucial in its continued attraction and political life ahead. The culture of having constituency specific election manifesto, Dialogues based governance agenda, e-governance etc are some other  major achievements of AAP in and out of governance. If they can manage to win in Punjab and do remarkably well in Delhi corporations elections ahead, it  is a viable opposition to look at. However, controlling internal dissent and ensuring organizational structure till the last village and town in India will be crucial for it as it does not operate on caste or religion or language basis.</comment>

<comment>Professor plz clear my doubt. When a new party having bunch of rioters,  rowdys manhandling(or womanhandling) police and aam junta, wife beaters, porn spammers and ministers having fake degree, pseudoseculars,  minority appeasers  and paki sympathisers led by a megalomaniac promise us new wave of clean fresh uncorrupt politics I can't understand one thing. Why r people so shocked when they see Kejriwal hug Laloo?</comment>

<comment>NO ANSWER SIMPLY USES HIS DEAN PROPERTIES</comment>

<comment>all up votes are from fake user ID's ..great work AAP ..good going you are on the right path</comment>

<comment>What are your views on AAP supporting Lalu and congress in Bihar...and please do not give that twisted logic that we only supported NK, it makes no sense as NK is taking support from both Lalu/Cong...you can not ask for a Gulabjamun not dipped in sugar syrup</comment>

<comment>Share your address here. 10,000 young men will come your to your place tomorrow morning and thrash you like a mad stray dog. Saley Loveday. </comment>

<comment>Dean, Amity University, Bhatan, Pune-Mumbai Expressway, Mumbai. Your statement shows the extent of your intolerance, idiocy, hypocrisy, undemocracy and plain stupidity. And lack of courage. So you are an anonymous Lalu. And I work with name, photo, and here is the address.</comment>

<comment>I may have differences with you.  But your comments are never abusive or derogatory unlike many of the comments here. True you write with your name, photo and now the address.</comment>

<comment>So brave</comment>

<comment>AAP is vaccine against communicable disease called BJP. BJP is viral disease which cause loss of rationality, peace of mind, nausea, severe headache and foot-in-mouth infections. It could be fatal sometimes if not treated in earlier stages of diagnosis.</comment>

<comment>AAP is no less than a cancer. It can potentially bring down the entire democracy with a stupid/unwarranted/impractical idea called Jan-Lokpal.</comment>

<comment>Only parasites are afraid of bitter medicine like Jan Lokpal. You should try burnol mean while.</comment>

<comment>DID U GET ALL ABOVE DISEASES. ? you are expert then you have to be treated and made a lab (rabbit)  person.</comment>

<comment>Hahaha...</comment>

<comment>You need 2 tablets. one after lunch and another before going to bed. Have fun.</comment>

<comment>You need many tablets to cure all these diseases--- of course i donot use any tabs as I have got no disease-- by the way r u going to be a mouse in the lab they need you, WHICH SHANKER KA PHOTO u use  US SHANKER KA DAYA HO AAPKE UPER, AS YOU PLEASE</comment>

<comment>That's initial symptoms of BJP virus. It makes you irrational and rude to fellow Indian. You may be in early stages of this deadly disease. Please get well soon. Besides the medicine I prescribed, I will also pray for your recovery. Have healthy and calm life. Jai Hind.</comment>

<comment>PLEASE NOTE THAT  I AM NOT SUPPORTER OF BJP___NEITHER IT WAS ELECTED HERE  NOR HAVE SUPPORTERS ____ YOUR EYES JUDGE NULL------ EXCEPT YOUR DISEASE _____I AM AAM AADM ( COMMON MAN) I CRITICIZE ALL NOT LIKE PAAPIANS WHO HAVE GOT FAVOUR AGAINST AAP. YOUR DISEASE OF INTOLERANCE IS GREAT  LET YOU CHECK BEFORE ADVIZING OTHERS WITHOUT PROPERLY JUDGING> DONOT WEAR AAP GLASSES U WILL HAVE TO EMBRACE GRASS EATERS LIKE UR NETAJI </comment>

<comment>So, What is your criticism of BJP? Do you agree that political affiliations are bad, should we only have allegiance to COI? What do you think?</comment>

<comment>I FEEL YOU ARE BIASED AND HERE COMMENTS ARE ON AAP PARTY WE FEEL VINDICATED IN THEIR ACTIONS AND HAS BECOME IMPOSSIBLE IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATIONS OF MANIFESTO WHICH IS NEITHER TRUE NOR viable when counting delhi budget> WHAT WE NEED IS A DELEGATION TO ASSEMBLIES  AND PARLIAMENT WITHOUT PARTIES> INDIVIDUALS TO BE CHOSEN BASING ON THEIR PROPERTIES> ONCE WHEN MANIFESTO IS NOT FULFILLED THEY SHOULD GO TO JAIL FOR  LIFE LONG suitable amendments to be made in the constitution. VOTER RECALLING POWER TO BE RESTORED TO VOTERS SO THAT ANY TIME PUBLIC CAN KICK MORONS AT ANY TIME. HOW LONG PEOPLE WILL BE CHEATED WITH POLL PROMISES. AAP HAS COME WITH A GOOD MANIFESTO BUT WHEN COUNTED AGAINST ITS BUDGET OF DELHI IT PROVED NOT VIABLE . PEOPLE OF DELHI ARE CHEATED BY THIS GREAT GUNNER FOR HIS AIM OF GETTING PM POST > DOES SOUTH SUPPORT THIS NAIVE? in the name of parties they do all mischievous things to shame our society.  MOST OF THE YOUNG GENERATION THEIR FOLLOWERS WITH SICKENING ATTITUDE without any shame unless a true socialism develops preventing religion , party, customs and castes THERE WOULD BE NO deliverance.</comment>

<comment>So, in brief, you suggested this1. Delhi budget is small, so manifesto of APP can not be implemented2. There should be contract based election and unit should be individual capacity3. Contract should be justiciable and violation should attract life long imprisonment4. AAP is party of cheater and Delhi people are gullied5. Youth who follow AAP are shameless and have sickening attitude6. Need to have true socialism like what Communist regimes touted forRebuttal1. Manifesto is for entire 5 years and many of promises have already been fulfilled and its work in progress. Honest criticism should be there but blindly saying that nothing is done is just ignorance on your part.2. Contract based polity not possible given that it requires constitutional amendment and no party will allow this. This is just utopian thought3. Not viable. There are many genuine constraints in implementation of contract terms. That is the reason why lots of welfare goals are put into Directive Principles of State Policy which are not justiciable4. Many thinks otherwise, there is diverse opinion about AAP. Who will judge AAP is up to the people of Delhi.5. Following a party is in individual capacity. They might agree with its ideology. You can not just paint all followers with same brush. Its their choice.6. True socialism is wishful thinking. All previous communist regimes have collapsed. New world order is build on the idea of both market and govt working together in collaborative manner.You have good intentions but your comment history is highly critical of AAP only. My guess is you are associated with Swaraj Abhiyaan, just my thoughts.Cheers.</comment>

<comment>REBUTTAL !, Why Well I ask to empower voter with recalling power to check deliverances, I am not supporting CPI, CPM ,CPI ML( extremist party with voilent attitude), I know all these parties due to their ideology failed in common walk of life.  I hate parties, YOU are whimsical still ,I donot belong to any party. still Indians  believe in morons like aap, congress and BJP, who should be subjected  to trail in the court ( any how there is no such law at present hence they cheat people ), AAP for not fulfilling their manifesto it is like similar other parties who cheated in the name of high morals( A FEW DEEDS WILL NOT COUNT WHEN TAKEN INTO MAMMOTH TASKS THEY PROMISED).  Why donot u agree that they too cheated people knowing their limitations they framed manifesto . Hence I ask for recalling power which can be excercised without any trouble as computers r there to compute and election commission is there to monitor. what is secularism? in true sense it is not being adopted by parties  some r elected  having  hindu, islamic, christian and other faiths, they can not remain in true secularism. They cheat people. you should attach now a days research and truth findings in every day life of people. No region, no religion  no party, no caste , no creed system should exist. I hate parties and divisions which r ruit causes of human sufferings in the past and present. Donot you know what islam ,christianity, and hinduism did to the world ? </comment>

<comment>Your suggestion that computers are there so we should go for implementing Re-calling. But Mani ,  India stood at 118th position in the recent UN E-Government Survey 2014. We can't even come close to our neighbours in IT infrastructure and you are talking about using IT in highly controversial option for electioneering. Your's is wishful thinking at least for now. I appreciate your idealistic tilt but one has to be pragmatic in his approach.Talk about the election commission, it is not able to implement progressive reforms like curbing the entries of criminals and muscle men. Election Commission commendably tried to stop paid news but still not able to curb money flow in elections. When it is not able to implement (because of govt of course) basic reform how could you expect it to implement recalling which requires resources, new institutions and efficient monitoring process.Political parties are not going anywhere, at least in our life time. People will remain religious in foreseeable future.Strength is in differences, not in similarities. Look, when there are no parties then there is single party, similar to Congress System of 1950s and 60s. What that did for country? so, diversity of parties is good to the certain extend. Anyways, I have lot to study...I will sign off now.</comment>

<comment>IT MEANS U DONOT LIKE RECALLING POWER TO VOTERS< DIVERSITY WILL BE THERE BUT NOT AS PARTIES WHO ELEVATE ONLY ONE MAN LIKE MODI R AK R NITISH R LALLU GRASS EATER> E GOVERNANCE SHOULD STAY CUTTING ALL BRIBERY AND MIDDLEMAN> WE HAVE SUFFERED A LOT>HOPE FOR GOOD NOT FOR LIERS ATLEAST.Better good luck in ur studies.</comment>

<comment>I like the idea of recalling but I think it will be long before it actually becomes reality. I appreciate your concern also. Thanks :)</comment>

<comment>Get sheila back in next time.....Sheila ki jawaani may be suspect, but she knows how to administer....</comment>

<comment>Key issues like Corruption?Yes,AAP is well on track by embracing Lalu and having 3-4 MLAs regularly going to courts for criminal cases and lady MLAs  going on a rampage.This moron has gone beyond shamelessness.Learn a bit from BJP supporters.Not even Modi will be spared from criticism if core issues are ignored.</comment>

<comment>Advertorial of AAP, Firstpost please mention at the top if posting Advertorials</comment>

<comment>AAP will rule for 35 years just as CPM, then it will be difficult to distinguish Delhi from Kolkata. Good luck.</comment>

<comment>AAP is like APP you can uninstall easily .....and they are crooks</comment>

<comment>And BJP Bunch of parasites .lethal and virulent.cannot be destroyed easily</comment>

<comment>AAP is like my thune</comment>

<comment>"Then again, the popular perception that the Central government, through Lt Governor Najeeb Jung, is preventing the AAP government to function smoothly has worked to Kejriwal's advantage."</comment>

<comment>Please do not call it Aam Admi Party....call it Arvind Kejriwal Party! And that exactly is the problem with the party which could have given us a viable third option after Cong and BJP. </comment>

<comment>Yes, we saw AAP standing near key issue Corruption-aka Laloo ji in Patna.</comment>

<comment>Administration is an Art.Not every arse knows it.And i am afraid to say, Delhi CM, with all his good intentions, is not the one who's any good at it either.</comment>

<comment>Good Intentions? who says that about the Laloo chamcha</comment>

<comment>nice article with the real facts</comment>

<comment>Lord Kejriwal is the future. As long as slaves comply to his whims and flatter him like Ajaz, Khujli has a future. The sensible people like Prashant Bhushan and Yoya are out.. so Khujli has all freedom to create his empire.Just wait till Somnath Bharati is out.. He is a true representative of activism that AAP represents</comment>

<comment>We have to choose the next PM from Lalu, Nitish, Kejriwal and Mamta. Choice is open.</comment>

<comment>Why not Tulsi Paksithani 56"</comment>
