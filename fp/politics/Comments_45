<comment>Don't understand why and how a creature like pappu exists in this eco system. He is not fit from any angel but still is been surviving.</comment>

<comment>Any ideology is better than Shirk ideology, Abrhamic cult ideology and Marx Revolutionary ideology and  Indian pseudo secularism </comment>

<comment>It gives one the impression that those who have commented have been drafted by interested persons who wish to protect the real force behind such persons by using innuendos and abuses against a particular person. There is a single comment on the main issue of violence in the Courts by lawyers and the guilt yet to be proved against the person appearing before the Judge being subjected to personal harm.</comment>

<comment>It is most disturbing that all the comments are more a targetted on Rahul Gandhi than on the important issue of democratic rights and the violence in the Courts by ""lawyers"" who are supposed to defend the law. No one denies that any proven case of anti national activities must be dealt with firmly. But on unprotected students and others in the name of patriotism! Patriotism is the not just the prerogative of a few who wish to violate the fundamental laws of ther land. Despite investigations by the police, reports are that there is no record of any anti national activity by Kanaiyalal Kumar.The only illegal acts are by those who are trying to attack him and his supporters in the name of ""patriotism"" and the police have been silent bystanders.</comment>

<comment>Congress ek soch hai..Jahan soch, wahan sochalaya....LOL</comment>

<comment>It is the fight between "Pakistan Zindabad, Bharat ke Tukde Tukde, Afzal Amar Rahe., har Ghar me Afzal Hoga" and the Indian laws and common sincere citizens. And this fight boils down into anti national forces (who either want to break India or do not give a damn for their selfish motives) and patriotic India loving people.</comment>

<comment>Gawd!  Please somebody put a muzzle on this pea brained, dimwitted, entitled anti national creature.</comment>

<comment>He mqay be pea braiuned but it is better than your brain which does not work!</comment>

<comment>Anybody supporting Rahul Gandhi must not be very bright.</comment>

<comment>Did Government force Papuu or other anti nationals to shout "Pakistan Zindabad, Bharat ke Tukde Tukde.."?</comment>

<comment>what dream?? i dont think anyone in them is there to study anymore and do some real jobwhat dream??? dream to become next haafiz sayeed /afzal guru of india by taxpayer money ??#shutdowncampuspolitics</comment>

<comment>Also stop paying freebis to these undeserving traitors.</comment>

<comment>Pappus words" those indulging in anti-national actvities should be dealt with"....well, thats exactly the govt is doing..its coming down strongly on people indulging in anti-national activities</comment>

<comment>But he is just reading the scrpt . He does not understand the meaning. He just wants to be in the news waanabe the prime minister.</comment>

<comment>We should listen to the useless and incompetent Rahul Gandhi and introduce Fabian socialism and Leninist or Stalinist communism into all Indian university campuses !  What a joke Rahul Gandhi is in the world's largest democracy !</comment>

<comment>So RAGA supports the traitors in fulfilling their dream of breaking India, he should be charged for sedition.</comment>

<comment>Nothing is more flawed then Rahul Gandhi's Support Afzal Guru ideology </comment>

<comment>The ones RG supports are just termite sponging off on reservations. The ones with dreams are doing quite fine. </comment>

<comment>Well all the termite should be cleaned uo asap.</comment>

<comment>Does Rahul really know about RSS philosophy? He needs to join it to know about it.</comment>

<comment>Oh but he wont comprehend -I mean understand-it. With his criminal record and British passport he will not qualify either.</comment>

<comment>You idiot and fraud pappu the people of our nation were watching the TV sitting with the anti-Indian people, hence everybody realized your character that you are the ugly anti-Indian chap. Hence where ever you go for campaign the public will throw you stone and may be eggs also on your face, shame on this stupid chap.</comment>

<comment>To the Congress and Rahul Gandhi every Indian who thinks as a patroit  has RSS idoleogy or is from the BJP.The people of India had enough of this congress and communist Ideology and these  people cannot fool the educated peopleof Indian anymore. The congress together with the communists have become an anti national party which believes in appeasement of a particular community at the cost of the nation only to get some votes.Its anti hindu and anti India policies are  to be seen now. It has a leader who has no charisma who has no connect with the majority of the  population of this country and as  such people of India should see that this anti national party never comes to power in the centre  or else the anti national elements which it had encouraged to grow in this country by appeasement  will  destroy the very foundations of this country we all are proud of.</comment>

<comment>He didn't elaborate what the flawed ideology is ... </comment>

<comment>It was not in the script given to him. How could he.</comment>

<comment>Crush their imaginations, their dreams? Their dreams to 'fight until india is ruined and broken into pieces'? That's a new low for even Pappu.</comment>

<comment>That's the normal Pappu level. The low was when Sonia cried all night when some terrorists were killed. </comment>

<comment>I did not think a new low was an option any more but I was misteken.</comment>

<comment>Which university of this country is going to become ''the den of anti-nationals'' is what one needs to find as per ''roster'' prepared by the greatest nationalist aka cultural organization RSS? With infusion of theology and mythology in the pure science sure the RSS will develop a formula to convert all of India into ''nationalist''.</comment>

<comment>Can he ever shut up! So what has been the left doing all these years? Were they not poisoning the minds of young all these years?</comment>

<comment>an other idiot is Kejriwal who speak and spits shit only whenever he speaks.</comment>

<comment>They are two peas in a pod and belong to the same traitor political party.</comment>

<comment>Congress after appealing to Pakistan to get rid of Modi is now in total anti India mode in the quest for power. This strategy is damaging the country even if it is not bringing any returns to the congress. People will not fall for the ploy of congress and its media dogs ,and have been reacting to the farce played out by them.</comment>

<comment>Sad story is that media is giving so much coverage to Rahul's blabber and frothing at the JNU episode while Hardly any coverage of the Prime Minister Of India's 'Make in India' meeting in Mumbai where 102 nations participated, 8245 meetings to conduct real business were held,8,90,000 visitors and a business of $220 billions conducted according to the reports. Go figure out which one news is more important and more praiseworthy and beneficial for the people of India.</comment>

<comment>What else u expect from Paid Media?</comment>

<comment>Italians do not have love or respect for India. For them India is only a looting ground with able support from communists and corrupt Media in their loot.Rahul will be more comfortable with christian militant organisation Opus Dei.</comment>

<comment>He is part of it a tool in their hands.</comment>
