<comment>A riveting article by Chandrakant Naidu clearly exposing the double standards and duplicity of Shivraj Singh Chouhan !!The only thing that is left out is that the Congress Governor who has been framed in the FIR of the Vyapam Scam is still continuing in his position shamefully. That just goes to show how much the BJP ruling both at the State and Centre have compromised and been hand in glove with the Governor who knows too much about this killer scam. When most of the Congress appointees have been thrown out or humiliated like in Gujarat, this Governor for strange reasons continued in his post relentlessly despite a slew of corruption charges against him and his family.  The Governor's son too was mysteriously murdered which was glossed over by the powers that be using the leverage of influence !!The CM and his family too have been caught in the web of this scam for which a petition has already been filed in the High Court !!</comment>

<comment>Santha Kumar is like Advani, left out due to old age, however, their ego  is greater than ego.People can only sympathise with them. They can occasionally provide ammo to the corrupt Congress to take on own party, so much loyalty they have  to BJP. The BJP leadership has rightly avoided such people who can betray the party within seconds of not being considered for power sharing!</comment>

<comment>Shivraj Singh Chouhan is the best chief minister, I have ever seen in MP. I remember Digvijay Singh government which was very corrupt.  Shivraj has done several work for state and its people, that's why he won last two state election. even in central elections he got nearly all seats. This FIRSTPOST is a political motivated news agency, funded by some foreign power. Central government should conduct a secret inquiry on the editors and writers of this news agency. I am 100% sure this FIRSTPOST is funded by foreign powers.</comment>

<comment>"I am 100% sure this FIRSTPOST is funded by foreign powers." --- Patriotism is the last refuge of a sc0undrel. May I remind that firstpost is owned by Ambani; who was one of the highest fund donors to the ruling party in the last years general elections ??</comment>

<comment>Firstpost is an Indian news organisation. The Indian news operations are part of the Network 18 media conglomerate owned by Reliance Industries, which also runs CNN-IBN and CNBC-TV18.[1]In May 2013, the news group was merged with the Indian edition of Forbes whose four top editorial heads including editor in chief Indrajit Gupta were dismissed under surprisingly humiliating conditions.[3][4] The event led to a media furore.[5]The editor of the combined Firstpost-Forbes India team, R. Jagannathan, is a Maoists writer</comment>

<comment>Chandrakant Naidu says "He seems to have already reached a conclusion before CBI has completed its inquiry into Akshay Singhâ€™s death."How come  Chandrakant Naidu has reached a conclusion before CBI has completed its inquiry?My father died in 2008 - I hold  Chandrakant Naidu responsible - I want a CBI inquiry. Chandrakant Naidu cannot deny he is responsible for my father's death - not before the CBI completes it inquiry and clears him..</comment>

<comment>FP, it seems we can not expect better. Shanta Kumar is past of the BJP, now new generation taking over and let them work. BJP shall not working from the view point for corrupt Congress, Mr. Kumar carried away with congress propaganda machinery which still enjoys confident of some paid media.</comment>

<comment>BJP and RSS and Modi should have kicked out back-stabber shanta kumar already and if a similar thing had happened in dynasty congress party,  sooonia and mafia would have kicked out the back-stabber almost immediately, what prevents BJP from taking action against the back-stabber puzzles me</comment>
