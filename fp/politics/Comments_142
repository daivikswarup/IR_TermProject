<comment>If the government assumes the loans from the farmers, it is just a free money scheme. Targeted grants to eligible farmers (based on pre-set criteria) would be a better approach, reducing time and overhead. Why don't the farmers take (government-subsidised) crop insurance? Why should they when they can demand free money based on a sob story?</comment>

<comment>What else this present cheaters and looters of government can give?</comment>

<comment>The farmers are getting more  attention compare to other section of society! Farming is business like any other business but they get all free bees like tax free income, subsidies electric, subsidies water for farms, and still they don't make profit to support the family.....pure and simple cases of financial mismanagement.Know that other businesses don't get no facilities but they pay excise taxes, they sales tax, and they face all time uncertainly of political unrest, bandh, extortion and corruption of the system!</comment>
