<comment>these fanatics need to calm the eff down and smoke some pot</comment>

<comment>What all you said is correct except bringing in Sangh Parivar. Sangh Parivar also wants you to stay in this country as it is also your motherland.</comment>

<comment>So is the Nationalist Hindu never succumb to the BS of Assaruddin Owaisi and his little idiot brother nor any Khans. More Owaisis type character curse at Sangh Parivar, stronger the Parivar gets.</comment>

<comment>The RSS is the most patriotic and Indian organization there is which promotes and preserves all things Indian.   These muslims have opportunistically abandoned their natural and native Indian heritage, yet are now demanding privileges from India....After they have found the kind of treatment they get from their Arab masters in Arabia, they are now crying buckets....</comment>

<comment>modi bhakts will have sleepless night over Asaduddin statement</comment>

<comment>So is since long Owaisis has sleepless nights and so is the traitors of the country!</comment>

<comment>Another mileage item for this politco thug.  Corrupt politcian</comment>

<comment>Muslims will live die and get buried beneath earth of India ....let all those who hate this spoil their own mood</comment>

<comment>Agree, no one say no to you. Just live like Bharitiey and in Bharat and worship what you want to worship to achieve your salvation. Parsi lived for centuries, no one force them to change any thing. All expected of you is live in the country to make it more sweeter and not poison it. Your community is habitual vomiting vermin against majority Hindu! Change that and you will never have problem. Have you ever opined about condition of Hindu in Pakistan or Bangladesh or even in Muslim dominated Kashmir? Look yourself in mirror and ask the question are you not in far far superior condition then those Hindu? </comment>

<comment>nuts. Will any paki receive your body? they will not receive you alive then stop thinking about receiving you dead</comment>

<comment>why are you so obsessed with pak ?</comment>

<comment>you are obsessed not me</comment>

<comment>your country</comment>

<comment>more likely it occupies your mind all d times</comment>

<comment>First be sure that u are not succumb to ISIS/Jehadis/ Talibans that is the need of the hour, do not divert the attention.</comment>

<comment>Are you sending your troop for an undercover operation?</comment>

<comment>Should change the constitution.. it was made by one ore more individuals not taking the opinion of the general populace of hindus after the partition...should make it similar to pak constitution and we should learn to behave from them on reducing the minorities to zilch in the country.</comment>

<comment>pakistan country for muslims.. partitioned on their own demand that hindus and muslims are 2 separate nations AND CAN NEVER LIVE TOGETHER.. they felt ashamed and insecure to stay in a hindu majority india then.. but their security ironically greatly increased once partition was done...and stay put here since hindus as you know are the most ridiculously tolerant and spineless community in the world., or at least the majority of them are so...</comment>

<comment>I agree. Although I was not born at the time of partition I cannot comprehend when the country is divided on Hindu Muslim communal lines why Muslims are here in larenumbers and hindus in smallnumbers are in Pakistan(East/West) now Bangladesh</comment>

<comment>yes. that's the whole easy point.. cant see why the majority do not see something as simple...</comment>

<comment>now you can have sleepless night over asaduddin statements , he is making all statements in delhi  and entire modi sarkaar can not do a thing</comment>

<comment>Freedom of Speech......and unfortunately government can not push cotton in mouth of Assarudin Owaisis nor Akkabaruddin. India has rule of law unlike the countries run by Islamic ideology from where you guys get inspiration.</comment>

<comment>So as per Owaisi.. Sangh Pariwar means congress and its cronies???</comment>

<comment>Congress has started a divisive politics... this has always led to dividing contray in past. People of India should not fall into trap of this power hungray politics of congress. Nation will suffer for years to come if we allow such anti national activities to continue. Only 1 lakh British ruled 33 crores of Indians for 200 years exploting this divide and rule stratagy. Congress has mstered this stratgy working with Britishers for so many years too. People of India need to unite against these divisive people. The biggest advantage is gained by these anti-BJP parties by this anti national movment. You should always understand that much that the who is getting biggest gain out of this , is the real culprit. Sab se adhik jise fayda hota ho wohi ise jyada hawa deta hai... Muslims are easy to get along with these divisive politics as little insecurity felt by them, gets exploited by congress in a big way. If the muslim is really having some respect and love for nation and have some brain, he would not fall into hands of this looters of congress. Bjp should start a mass movement against these anti national con-gress</comment>

<comment>there are videos on the youtube made by aamir khan's religious guru ''tariq jameel'', where he is discussing how proud muzzie this guy is...in some other videos tariq jameel also discusses about how those 72 v!rg!ns in heaven would look like..that's the bull crap which they call it as their religion</comment>

<comment>Saw the video.I never had a good opinion about this guy. A guy who cannot love his wife and divorces what can he say about tolerance and intolerance. People were cray about his satyamevajayete I said verses from devil's mouth</comment>

<comment>Y will Muslims leave India?? It is the only country where they are fed like pigs and take care like gods!</comment>

<comment>millions of hindus,sikhs,buddhiest,jain,parsis were killed, millions of kaafir women were raped by the muslims in ancient india and other parts of the world...and by the way it is still happening all around the world...why? bcoz they worship some other god and not allah, that's what i call intolerance...yet to see a muslim with balls to say it out in open...Islam means terror..Quran (2:191-193) – “And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution [of Muslims] is worse than slaughter [of non-believers]… but if desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful. And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah.”Read the last line carefully, i repeat ''And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah''...wake up hindus..</comment>

<comment>How much Amir Khan got from ISI/Dawood Ibrahim for providing such a statement? Investigations must be done.Meanwhile discrimination against muslims have increased following the Paris attacks, so feel free to move there Amir Khan. No ones gonna miss you.</comment>

<comment>I think Muslims is another community like Hindu , Christ .... All of us are very much indians and are safe than Pakistan, Afghanistan  or anywhere where else. Leave that politics , politics and everything aside ..... I work with many peoples and while working i did not find any difference if someone is muslim or hindu. ... grow up guys we are happy here and focus on our own problems than tatics by some people..</comment>

<comment>yes, we hindus must understand the tactics of muzzies...</comment>

<comment>We will simply whip you into submission</comment>

<comment>''as proud Indians''?? LOL....is he not contradicting the teachings of Quran? or has he changed his mind after the revelation about the ISIS, giving the job of toilet cleaners to the south asian jihadis?</comment>

<comment>Who the hell considers muslims Indians?</comment>

<comment>Well said owaisi saheb.....</comment>

<comment>Secularism is the bane of all problems...</comment>

<comment>It is again we have to quote the features of Indian secularism.Its elements are 1.diversity.2.Pluralism.3.Multi faced 4. Multi lingual.5. Multi culture 6. Multi religions. .Famous quote is it is like many rivers flowing and joining the sea.That is secularism. Yes. The sea is vast and beautiful - calm /roaring and dangerous. After all good water from  the rivers mix with salt water of the sea (politics) and it becomes salty and not good for drinking!!! Our secularism is like that it is very beautifully described but actually like a sea water which is of no use We are fed up with kitchidi secularism in politics. We are tolerating it.</comment>

<comment>Comprehensive ...</comment>

<comment>Yes like terror should not be linked to  a religion politics also should not be linked to secularism  to avoid gutter politics sunk in salt water.</comment>

<comment>Bro.. would I be lying if I suggest 2 faith institutions indoctrinated people for 1500 yrs with the idea of Kafir-infidel & they are still not apologetic about it... Isn't being un-apologetic of it the very source of all terror politics... 2nd the word secular has been perversively misused by all... So ambiguous is the definition that even our SC struggles to decide... Should any ambiguity be a preamble of our & any society....</comment>

<comment>Yes no religion should give an impression that it is associated with terror.But Abraham cult is exception to it going by their history.Only our laws of the land should be very clear about it and how to deal with it but it is not happening in the name of secularism related politics.2.Secularism is a mirage </comment>

<comment>Intolerance debate was a communist conspiracy - the fool has walked into the trap, like Biharis.The 100% genuine intolerance is intolerance against inequality.==============================================================As there are no scams, Intolerance issue is a pseudo-scam, created by pseudo-secularists in pseudo-democracy [Socialism was introduced under terror of emergency and socialism is legal robbery as distinct from charity], created with people with pseudo-ideal of equality. Pseudo-news channels [all news is generated from their armchairs] spread it.When will BJP go for privatization and free gun laws? It will remove all pseudos in one stroke. Guns wakes up people..========================================================What can be more intolerant than ideology of communism with its single party dictatorship. Why dont Moodys and Raghuram Rajan recommend a BAN on communist parties? Strangely in this case a BAN is symbol of tolerance.People of India elect OWNERS of India than rulers of India. Why? President of India owns overwhelming share of PSU and Public sector bank shares. Since president is just a figure head - PARLIAMENT OF INDIA OWNS INDIA.Democracy is the child of capitalism. Which implies private ownership. How can India be a democracy, without privatization?Capitalism assumes tolerance of INEQUALITY, but reservation policy murders merit - an individual right.Jefferson said the ONLY work of government should be protection of Individual rights.My main argument is either all are communal or none is communal.Look at constitution itself..India is a Ocholocracy [rule by the mob, example reservation policy; casteism is also communalism and of a worse kind as stable vote banks are formed - which has led to emancipation from democracy of political parties and state] led by the mafia[till recently we had a genuine Italian one]. IT IS A SHAME TO CALL INDIA A DEMOCRACY.Pseudo-seculars brainwash that1)Opposite of communal is secular.2)From Point 1, Logically then opposite of Individual must be religious - an absurdity. Hence statement 1 is absurd.3)The correct antonym is Opposite of communal is INDIVIDUAL and opposite of secular is religious. Individualism comes only with CAPITALISM -positive spinoff of selfishness and profit.4)Therefore by almost Iron logic of Euclid either ALL are communal or ALL are not communal. It depends on how much India is capitalist[free economy].5)The fundamental RED communalism is therefore division between Bourgeoisie and proletariat - impeding growth of capitalism and Individualism. Reservation policy and socialism is the reason why if I were the president of India, as owner of public sector banks, PSU would HANG MYSELF in abject shame.</comment>

<comment>Well spoken Owaisi sir. At this time of great crisis for Muslims, we shall be proud if a Muslim leader assumes the task of herding together misguided youth from giving the Muslims all over the world a bad name. An international conference should be held of all Muslim religious leaders and the need to amend or reform the religion  according  to the times. Instead, modern education should be laid stress on all youth and a proper roadmap must be given to their respective governments. I am sure Muslim can be much better then what they are being projected to now. Medieval Christians were more horrifying then the Muslims but then they moved on and people rejected such extreme views. These extreme views are nothing but  exploitation on the ordinary population who are mostly ignorant. Times will change but people must rise to the occasion.</comment>

<comment>when semi   literate random yogi adidyanaths and sakshi marajs rant there is no danger to the basic  fulcrum of the country unlike the owasis azam khans and bukharis whose  hateful venom against the  country can undermine the very foundation of our country these mullahs have their own  divisive agenda</comment>

<comment>That  is one positive view regardless of what Owasi's image as a communal leader.</comment>
