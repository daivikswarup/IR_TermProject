<comment>Seth , you must return your awards and all preveliges you got worth for your unworthy writings . Mere returns of award will claim a penalty of 1 crore unless you return all the beneficiaries.</comment>

<comment>Daily Mail Bureau | Mangaluru | Oct 18, 2015::  The probe into the murder of a Bajrang Dal activist in Moodbidri town of coastal Karnataka has taken an interesting turn.A local BJP leader has claimed that witnesses in the case are receiving threat calls from international mobile numbers, asking them not to testify in the case.To make matters worse for the police, the prime witness allegedly committed suicide two days ago.The murder has also taken a political angle with the BJP — which is strong in the coastal Karnataka region — alleging that the Congress government was deliberately not according importance to the incident.“It is evident that everyone is trying to hush up the case. The Congress politicians are not showing any interest in ensuring justice to the victim’s family.“Had the police shown concern, they would have arrested the culprits by now.“We are hearing that other witnesses are being threatened over phone from international mobile numbers, including Pakistani phone numbers,” said Dakshina Kannada MP (BJP) Nalin Kumar Kateel.On October 9, Prashanth Poojary (26), an active Bajrang Dal member and a flower vendor, was hacked to death by six unidentified bike-borne miscreants in Mudbidri.He had recently actively taken part in busting illegal slaughter houses and protested against cattle trafficking in the region.On October 15, prime witness Vaman Poojary (68) allegedly committed suicide at his daughter’s home.While the police claimed that he ended his life due to personal reasons, others are linking it to Prashanth’s murder.“Vaman Poojary had clearly seen the faces of the assailants who attacked Prashanth. He could have helped us in identifying the miscreants.“Unfortunately, he is no more and this has been a big blow to the probe. Nevertheless, we are confident of nabbing the killers,” a Dakshina Kannada district police officer said.The cops believe that all the six assailants have fled to Kerala. Prashanth’s cousin Dhyanesh alleged: “We have shared information about the suspects with the police.Read also: Accused in Prashanth Poojary’s murder believed to be nabbed by police“It is already a week, but we are not seeing any progress in the probe,” he said.Kateel also alleged that police already have information about the suspects, but were delaying the probe.“After Prashanth had busted the illegal slaughter house with his friends, a protest demonstration was held by a group in Moodbidri.“Addressing the protesters, their leader Haneef had vowed to take revenge against all those involved in the raid on the slaughter house.“Prashanth was killed at the same spot where the speech was made, but action has not been taken against Haneef so far.“The police should have arrested and questioned him,” the BJP leader said.Courtesy: Daily mail and the links used above.</comment>
