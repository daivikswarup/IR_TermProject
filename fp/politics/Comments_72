<comment>Congress fits the bill of Churchill:Sir Winston Churchill..."Power will go to the hands of rascals ,rogues, freebooters; all Indian leaders will be of low caliber & men of  straw. They will  have sweet tongues & silly hearts. They will fight amongst themselves for power &  India will be lost in political squabbles. A day would come when even air & water would br taxed in India."</comment>
