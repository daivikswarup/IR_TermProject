<comment>Biggest anti-national step besides the release of 5 terrorists is the removal of Jagmohan as Governor, who had literally started breaking the spine of terrorism and this guy gets him removed. </comment>

<comment>well as a eulogy fine....but as a reality the misuse of position to release 5 terrorists in 1989 which marked the beginning of vicious terror campaign against India needs to be said as well. True leaders do not place self interest ahead of national interests....sadly this man was not exemplary of that....however Indians are tolerant so let the author and more like him indulge in the spirit of tolerance...</comment>

<comment>It is alright to pay homage to some one who is no more but historical facts do not support the claim of author.</comment>

<comment>a democrat at heart  nationlists to the core  and a titan of mordern kashmir  david devdas please dont mislead people by attributing this virtues to some body  like the turn coat shameless politician like mufti  who after sucking upto the abdullah family did several political summersaults  to remain n power and for his greed for power he was shamelessly backing anti indian kashmiri separatist kashmir is in a decay state because of people like him  first post please don,t remove my comment which you have being doing lately</comment>

<comment>He was always flirting with Hurriyat and other pro-pakistani elements in Kashmir. How is he a nationalist? He was from one of the two dominant families in Kashmir who have been ruling for the last 60+ years. Kashmir is his family jagir. Don't say he is a nationalist.</comment>

<comment>No Kashmiri Muslim leader has openly stated and worked for true secularism in Kashmir and return/rehabilitation of the Pandits. Their hatred for India and love for Pakistan differes only in degree. If the Hurriat and others like Malik and Mirwaiz are extremes, Mufti  and Abdullah are comparatively a little milder. That is all.</comment>

<comment>it is fashionable for sickulars - the author is clearly one of the cabal - to mislead indian people.</comment>

<comment>David ji u are no nationalist and neither was Mr Sayeed. He allowed the massacre and forced exodus of Hindus from Kashmir. And even now he, his daughter and his party stand against reintegrating Hindus in Kashmir</comment>

<comment>Nationalist to the core ??You mean Kashmiri Nationalism !?</comment>

<comment>As I desperately want to adorn  the Nationalist label from Nagpur HQs, I believe the imbecilic Chaddis that all through his life, Mufti stood  strident  against seperatism, Jihadis  and is a true Nationalist and PDP is an anti-dynasty party !!  Ha Ha Ha !!</comment>

<comment>Did he die a natural death? I Doubt. Arrest her daughter and take her on police remand so that the truth can come out.</comment>

<comment>RIP Muftiji..Mufti Sahab supported Kashmiri Pandit re-settlement in Kashmir.You hated Pakistani terroristsYou were a nationalist at heart.That's why BJP made you J&K Chief Minister......You will always reside in hearts of Modiji and his Bhakts..They will always cherish your memory</comment>
