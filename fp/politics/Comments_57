<comment>WISH BJP HAD SELECTED NITISH KUMAR INSTEAD OF MODI IN 2014--------------------Can you believe it?.........This is not the India we wanted in 2014.......Indian people are so disappointed with Narendra Modi that 2019 has started looking like 1977 again. Indian men are angry and Indian women are disappointed at how this feku from Gujarat and his 40 chor and 5 choranis have done nothing to change how things were in India under Congress but made it worse. Black money was promised within 100 days but not a single paisa is brought back yet, nobody has gone to jail for corruption. Suresh Kalamadi is free, A. Raja is free, Kanimozi is free, Sharad Pawar is free,…. Nobody has gone to jail but on top of that Modi has delivered his own corruption, nepotism and incompetency through Arun Jaitlley’s DDCA corruption, Sushma Swaraj’s misuse of office, nepotism and breaking the law, Vasundhara Raje’s blatant misuse of power and helping a criminal Lalit Modi, the Vyapam scam and murders, Chattisgargh PDS scam, Smiriti Irani’s lying under oath about education, religious intolerance and killing of Muslims, increasing fanaticism and making a laughing stock of India with gayish behavior on world stage by hugging Western leaders all the time. Modi and his nincompoop goons could not protect India at Pathakot terrorist attacks on Indian soil… We only wish that BJP had selected a family loving man, a good husband and good father Nitish Kumar in 2014 instead of this Feku Modi.</comment>

<comment>Yasin Mallick will f*c k her if c goes against porkistani ideology. He f*-ked her sistr t00.</comment>

<comment>c is scared of these rApist Islamists in criminal den of 'K' valley where they mint money for law n disorder. These criminal Islamists r violent clans of Nabi who will never sit quite, whatever u do 4 them. Only thing that keeps them quite is bullet n bombs. West is deir answer.</comment>

<comment>Jammu and Ladakh  suffered discrimination and neglect since Independence. Even though Jammu generates more revenue, the representation in J&K Assembly is less. The Valley enjoys the lion's share of development spending. There is no fair play in the Administration. The Valley has largely been purged of its native Hindu population. Article 370 is "as dangerous as cancer" and has been used by power elites and vested interests in bureaucracy, business and the law courts in Srinagar as an instrument of exploitation. The only way to cure cancer is to remove the patient's organs or body parts. The best solution is to make Kashmir a buffer state like Bhutan or a guarded neutrality similar to Switzerland. Scrap Article 370 and grant statehood or UT status for jammu and Ladakh. The status of Hindus in Pakistan is infinitely worse than that of the Muslims in India. So any solution that involves Hindus ending up in Pakistan is far worse than a solution involving Muslims ending up in India. The Pandits have already migrated out of the valley and PDP is not keen on their resettlement. So spending time and money on the Valley is a wasteful exercise</comment>

<comment>It is time for not only Mehbooba but for the entire nation to stand up and ask for their pound of flesh as committed and promised by Modi & group of thugs through their jumlas during the pre election days.</comment>

<comment>KASHMIR IS NOT GUJARAT.... THEY DO NOT LIKE DHOKLA AND THEY KNOW HOW TO FIGHT</comment>

<comment>Modi and BJP are becoming untouchables just like Congress was during Lok Sabha elections 2014???</comment>

<comment>She has misquoted in this story please check she didn't not say this "I did not join hands with Modi. I joined hands with the people who joined hands with Modi," Mehbooba told reporters after her meeting with Zohra.But said Mufti (her father) had joined hands with Modi. He joined hands with the people who joined hands with Modi.So Chill.</comment>

<comment>Didn't join hands with Modi but with people who supported him: Mehbooba on Kashmir govt formation ....So support the people by supporting PM Modi!! </comment>

<comment>Thanks for highlighting many of the gaffes of Feku Maharaaj who made a fool of himself with his zilch knowledge of history and current events !!And wish to add the following of his weird claims too :-1.China is spending over 20% of its GDP, on education,  when in actual it was about 4% and this bugger after coming to power even reduces the miniscule spending on this critical  sector !!2. Shiva is the first plastic surgeon !!</comment>

<comment>Listen.... I do not take anybody's sides. I am just a truth teller........ But thanks for telling about dumbo Modi's more of amazing knowledge. The nation thinks he is a kahli bheja but we had no idea that he is such a pig with so much lipstick.</comment>

<comment>Lol, the truth teller of sixth century in desert tribe belt...born hater...</comment>

<comment>THAT IS NOT IMOPRTANT. PAY ATTENTION HERE .... Modi is not available for comment today.... He is screaming like Azam Khan's buffalo because Amit Shah applied Burnol on Modi's hemorrhoids by mistake yesterday... The doctors have advised him not to eat dhokla and make gas in Delhi to add to the bad pollution...... It is a bad news..... the BJP Burnol movement has gone terribly wrong...</comment>

<comment>I am a Hindu Swami from Varanasi... Filthy Ganga is my witness</comment>

<comment>LALOO PRASAD YADAV AND MODI------------------No one can deny that Laloo Prasad is a family loving man. He is a good husband and good father. Modi is neither. Laloo Prasad has stood by his wife of 45 years through all good and bad times in their lives. Modi did not and lied about it. Laloo went to prison many times but Rabdi Devi stood by his side. Our Napunsak and Liar PM Narendra Modi is exactly the opposite. He ran away from his wife Jasodaben after marrying her at the grown up age of 18 (not a child marriage). Modi never cared for her, never asked for her, never provided for her, never visited her during her sicknesses, never asked her if she needed money and never gave her a divorce. He then went on denying his marriage publicly on all election affidavits by lying through his teeth. Laloo Prasad Yadav never ever did any of these. Modi spread lies that he left Jasodaben for the nation. He asked his chumachas to compare him with Gautam Buddha. Modi spread so many lies to cover up his failures and bhagoda behavior that it would put a serial criminal to shame. Laloo Prasad Yadav has 9 children and he has taken care of all of them very well. Modi is a napunsak and he could not even do his wedding night right.... let alone produce children..... Now the country is wondering why this motu is hugging ridiculously all foreign leaders even if the pictures show clearly that they do not like his undiplomatic and creepy behavior.</comment>

<comment>Laloo Prasad Yadqv is a corrupt leader with the poorest of credentials who has been involved in several financial scams.  Nothing else is relevant in the realm of politcs and governance.  You should be out of your mind to compare Narendra Modi with Laloo Prasad Yadav.</comment>

<comment>The Mountain Man called Dashrath Manhi is a great and respected love story of Bihar......... while the Napunsak called Narendra Modi is a shameful and despised story of a runaway husband who lied for 47 years cover up his failures.</comment>

<comment>Bihar is the land of the loving husband and the Mountain Man called Dashrath Manjhi who was just a daily laborer but who spent his life to build a monument in his wife's memory.... The people in Bihar do not respect pigs with lisptick and runaway napunsak and lying husbands like Feku Modi..... NEVER NEVER FORGET THAT</comment>

<comment>Don't even mention low grade and criminal Napunsak Modi in Bihar. You will get beaten up into pulp. They do not like bhagoda husband.</comment>

<comment>The people of Bihar rejected Modi and his nautanki with fancy headdresses and poor oratory... and accepted honest and down to Earth man called Laloo Prasad Yadav</comment>

<comment>Laloo Prasad is popular in Bihar because he speaks his mind and speaks the truth... unlike Modi who is a serial liar</comment>

<comment>Laloo Prasad Yadav loves his wife and stands by her even today..... Unlike the deadbeat husband Modi whose wife is living in squalor</comment>

<comment>Laloo Prasad Yadav did not lie to the nation about marriage like.... the serial liar Modi did</comment>

<comment>Laloo Prasad Yadav did not abandon his wife like ... bhagoda Modi did</comment>

<comment>Laloo Prasad Yadav is a man... not a napunsak like Modi</comment>

<comment>The lady said she don't qualify to become CM of J&K.</comment>

<comment>BJP should refrain from allying with PDP whose chief thinks Modi and BJP are different and hates Hindus.</comment>

<comment>BJP AND MODI ARE SHAMELESS LIARS AND CHEATS.  THEY WILL DO ANYTHING FOR POWER AND MONEY.  THEY WILL TRY THEIR LEVEL BEST TO FORM THE GOVERNMENT ALLYING WITH HARD LINER PARTY LIKE PPP.  THANK GOD WE HAVE NOT GIVEN POWER TO BJP FOR MOST OF THE POST INDEPENDENT PERIOD ABOUT 60 YEARS, ELSE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN RUINED BY NOW.</comment>

<comment>filthy northies never cared for mehbooba sister and now abusing both the ladies TN Punjab support kashmir aspirations</comment>

<comment>This is what happens when lack of courage to privatize - watch out Modi and Rajnath Singh. India, Privatize or Perish. Example is 30 years civil war in Sri Lanka.Am I being impractical?Now BJP/RSS should bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=========================================================Consider example of Bangalore in 2014 -Bangalore city and Bruhat (areas surrounding Bangalore which are newly developed) Bangalore has 28 MLA seats. Bangalore and Bruhat Bangalore has approximately one crore population.Karnataka has six crore population.Karnataka legislature assembly has 224 seats.Population per seat in Bangalore = 357,143Population per seat in Karnataka apart from Bangalore=( 6-1) crores/ (224-28) = 255102Disenfranchisement ratio of Urban Voter = 255102/347143 = 0.73. If other urban centres are taken into account in Bangalore, the ratio is expected to fall further. If Ratio is equal to one, there is no disenfranchisement at all.[Disenfranchisement ratio = Per seat population of Karnataka apart from Bangalore divided by Per seat Population of Bangalore]The system has not been able to correct itself, hence it has subverted itself. Why did emancipation take place? Political parties, state has emancipated themselves from democracy by the vehicle of reservation policy.That is because stable VOTE BANKS are formed. India was never a democracy – it was Ocholocracy[mob rule] where by definition individual rights are murdered. Socialism, unlike voluntary charity, introduced into constitution during emergency [with BJP/RSS in jail] is by definition legal robbery.</comment>

<comment>What a caption showing hate of Modi? If she said it, it is a serious matter of hate Hindus. Shame on these Kashmiri hater Muslim goons who eat on our tax money but their heart lie else where. No matter what one does for them, these criminals shall never change. No wonder, Islam is now being criticised everywhere.</comment>

<comment>All over the world Muslims are criticized wherever democracy us properly practiced.</comment>

<comment>1. Did she say she hates Hindus?2. Hating Modi is not hating Hindus. 3. She and her family and her ancestors are from kashmir. So how will she hate kashmir 4. Muslims pay their taxes too. They don't live on your doled out money.I think people like you who have an innate prejudice against another community will accuse them of anything.  We have enough saffron terrorism in this nation which you prefer to ignore. But then you will call me a muzzie, paki without knowing who I am and label me with some of your fancy names.</comment>

<comment>Does hating a Muslim mean hating ur Mohammad? Then y does ur Abu Baqrs kill all others than Muslims? Muslims hardly pay but extyract far more than that. J&K has the highest budgetary allocation in India than any other state. However that besides, y do these criminals cry porkistan living in India. There is nothing like saffron terrorism. This is discovered by international criminal Abrahamic brigade3 to defame Hindus to convert the one3 billion Hindusa whom ur deserter Abrahamics hate. Truth is too bitter to swallow. Almost all terrorists are Muslims but it doesn't mean that all Muslims r terrorists but facilitators. Apologists of terrorists. Why don't Muslims stop breeding them. It is ur Muslim community who breeds them/.</comment>

<comment>So why did the BJP make an alliance in the first place? Why didn't they place the state under President's rule? No wonder you are a Bhakt.... Ha ha ha.....</comment>

<comment>I always knew this fake marriage was to end in a bitter divorce.</comment>

<comment>Mehbooba cannot come to power without the BJP support.  She can kiss power goodbye if she runs after the Congress or the National Conference.</comment>

<comment>If there is mid term election now in Jammu & Kashmir, the BJPee sure will be consigned to dust both in Jammu as well as the Valley and hence this desperation on its part to some how form a Govt.!!</comment>

<comment>It is nice to see that at least the PDP led by Mehbooba has some shame and is against an alliance of opportunism unlike her late Father who sacrificed his party's ideologies and principles at the altar of political expediency and embraced Feku which looked wholly unnatural and a drama for power  !!Let her maintain this principled stand of no truck with BJPee at any cost !!</comment>

<comment>I doubt she has any.high standards of morality or integrity or principles or whatever. She is another cunning politician trying to get the best deal and is checking which way the wind are blowing, considering that BJP is losing all elections since the lok sabha elections.</comment>

<comment>At least, she is not hankering after power at all costs like the BJPee. It is the BJPee leaders who are desperate to yet again stitch an an in unholistic tie up  with her party despite being an alliance of contradiction and mutually antagonistic ideologies !!</comment>

<comment>How do you know she is not hankering after power. She knows no one else can form govr other than her. So she is taking her time. She is being very shrewd. If she was not after power,  she could let some one else be CM in her party. She herself has admitted that she doesn't have the experience.</comment>

<comment>By not being over anxious and aligning with the avarcious BJPee leaders in desperation.  She could have well become the CM, if she wanted.  But by biding her time and taking that calculated risk, she has at least proved that she is not so power hungry like the shameless BJpee leaders !!</comment>

<comment>What is his party's ideology apart from racist communal hate of Hindus???</comment>

<comment>He he !! If so, why the shameless BJPee joined hands with such a rabid anti-Hindu outfit !?  Shame on this unscrupulous party devoid of principles or ideology but soaked in only political opportunism !!</comment>

<comment>You are supporting people who hate Hindus who constitute a majority in the Indian sub-continent.  You do not seem to follow the opinions of the free world.</comment>

<comment>I am not supporting any one.  I just wish to state that Mehbooba at least has some shame left, while the BJPee in its lust for power has thrown everything away and running naked !!</comment>

<comment>Nobody likes Modi.... Nitish Kumar would have been more popular and acceptable leader of NDA than feku Modi</comment>

<comment>Nitish kumar ki aukat nahee thi PM banne ki.</comment>

<comment>BUT HE DID NOT RUN AWAY FROM HIS WIFE, ABANDON HER AND LIE ABOUT IT FOR 47 YEARS LIKE FEKU MODI</comment>

<comment>That why NDA has 340 seats ?? Your selfawarness is appreciable halkatji</comment>

<comment>That is the most important point to consider.</comment>

<comment>That was mainly achieved by vote fragmentation, carpet bombing  via campaigns thru's sleaze Corporate money, lies, deceit, deception, exaggerated promises, illusion of development and most importantly milking the 10 year anti incumbency against the UPA Govt. !!</comment>

<comment>NDA won because Indian people were totally frustrated with Congress corruption and dynasty... People would have elected even a street dog in 2014. The same thing happened in 176 after Indira Gandhi declared emergency. The same hing happened when Yedyyruppa' looted Karnataka in 2012. People elected corrupt Congress again. People are realizing their mistake and have voted against Modibaba and his 40 chor in Delhi and Bihar. Punjab and Bengal are next and Modibaba back to Gujarat with Jasodaben (if not in jail) in 2019.</comment>

<comment>As I said your self awareness is great halkat maulanaji</comment>

<comment>YOU ARE A PORKI... GO TO PAKISTAN</comment>

<comment>Shouldn't u be saying come to Pakistan :))</comment>

<comment>WOMEN ARE TAKING MATTERS IN THEIR OWN HANDS-------------------Hindu Goddesses in heaven are also tired of meek and useless Hindu Gods. For example, Goddess Parvati is tired of her crazy husband Lord Shiva who does not come home home in the Himalayas for years, does not wear a shirt and even beheaded her own son called Ganapati. She complained and complained to Lord Indra but he said he was not like King Zues. As a meek Hindu king of the Gods, he is helpless. So Goddess Parvati is taking matters in her own hands. She is attracted to the big stud called Mohammed. Some Gandhrava have seen her doing hanky panky with Mohammed who was also seen on Parvati yesterday.</comment>

<comment>Paki pig</comment>

<comment>Mohammed is not leaving us darpok Hindus even in heaven... I saw Mohammed was getting a BJ from Goddess Saraswati while he had grabbed Ganapati's chubby behind</comment>

<comment>Continue puking paki pig</comment>

<comment>We only wish that BJP had selected clean character and smart Nitish Kumar instead of this Feku Modi.... who is destroying our country day after day after day.... He has no idea about what is going on in the nation...... Modibaba and his 40 chor and 5 chorani will fully destroy our great nation even before 2019 will start looking like 1977 again.</comment>

<comment>Copy paste -copy paste ..no further proof required that u r  one of those  paki aap zombie :)) </comment>

<comment>LOOKS LIKE YOU DO NOT LIKE THE TRUTH</comment>

<comment>Khee khee kheeAap zombies like u (paki or Indian) run away from truth like rabied dogs from water ..and shouting (caps lock) doesn't help mulle when all u do is lie and spew venom </comment>

<comment>MOHAMMED IS ON SARASWATI NOW AND SHE IS SCREAMING LIKE AZAM KHAN'S BUFFALO.... CAN YOU HELP INSTEAD IF DOING GRRRR... HERE?</comment>

<comment>Enjoy screaming piggy pig</comment>

<comment>do you mind?..... I had a very bad dream. I am a Hindu so I woke up quickly.... I saw Mohammed was getting a BJ from Goddess Saraswati while he had grabbed Ganapati's chubby behind.</comment>

<comment>look closely u  were the one decked up as a female with the pedo !</comment>

<comment>Who likes u? Self appointed opinion master. Born jihadi hater in tribal desert cult.</comment>

<comment>CHAI PE CHARCHA…….. MODI KI SHAADI FACTS------1. The marriage to Jasodaben was real and legal2. Modi was 18 years old in marriage3. Modi is a napunsak4. Modi ran away on suhaag raat5. Modi never provided for Jasodaben in 46 years6. Modi never gave divorce although marriage was legal7. Modi never cared for Jasodaben through sicknesses and poverty8. Modi lied on legal election affidavits for 24 years in all Gujarat elections9. Modi was compelled by new law to admit his marriage in 2014 LS elections...10.  BJP and chumachas glorified Modi and put lipstick on the pig11. Modi and Amit Shah used state machinery and BJP thugs to keep on eye on Jasodaben12. They used stupid Indian people who will believe anything13. Chumachas argued Jasodaben is a traitional Hindu lady who does not complain14 Uma Bharti said Modi is a Vinash Purush………</comment>

<comment>Modi communal hai. Against muslims and now against dalits. He will surly take away reservation from dalits. He is basically pro upper caste.</comment>

<comment>porkis r notorious haters like u. Shame on u racist goon.</comment>

<comment>In his Gujarati book Samajik Samarasta, Modi had referred to dalits as "mentally reta*rded." His views on Muslims are already known. Now we know his views on dalits.</comment>

<comment>u can fake any idea but the truth is that u belong to criminal communal racist desert tribes.</comment>

<comment>The Truth is Bitter and Uncomfortable but the Truth is the Truth. It will not Go Away like Modi Wanted Poor Jasodaben to go away, Like his Crimes of Killing over 3,000 People in 2002 to Go Away. Darpok Modi must face the truth. Bhagoda Modi will have to Face the Music One Day in Jail. Bhagoda Modi can run but he cannot hide.</comment>

<comment>each and every muslim leader big or small dream to make a separate state like pakistan and our so called super secular helps them to realize their dream.muslims as a mass has always been a divisive force.</comment>

<comment>A slight modification. Most parties in India, except BJP, are family dictatorships. Most of them are socialist along with being pseudo-secular, though they not be run by muslims. Socialism has to lead to single party dictatorship in long run because the socialist system is economically infeasible for a  nation like India with huge population and scant resources - triggering waves of economic crisis and collapse of currency</comment>

<comment>TN and Punjab support only AK. dont spread lies like this.</comment>

<comment>Add karnataka also</comment>

<comment>obviously.. a man who got the biggest mandate has the support of the people of country. it is up to Mehbooba to support the people of India or not!! it is a good and exciting situation to see which side the PDP is. also the Kher's episode has thrown open the challenge to so called peace lovers to chose a side....</comment>

Who would ensure peaceful life to kashmiris with more employment opportunities instead of dangling into political crisis. None could do earlier nor it seems others would do it now.</comment>

<comment>And you northies left rubiya to suffer </comment>

<comment>Brave Mehbooba, Carry ON. Now everybody is challenging Modi. If RSS is still interested to form Government then it will be most shameless act.</comment>

<comment>U a paki or porky?</comment>

<comment>He is very much Indian.  But u are from a non existent akhand barat . So fk off from this news site which is made for Indians</comment>

<comment>The highly provocative stand of Mehbooba gives an opportunity for BJP to allow the government to collapse, and let President's Rule be imposed. Immediately after that, the Centre should carve out Jammu and Ladakh, and salvage 88 % of the land area in a highly sensitive border state. Kashmir should be placed under army rule, media should be completely banned and the stone-pelters should be dealt with in the language they understand. There is no need to spend even a penny of Indian taxpayers money on Kashmir - channelize all of it in Jammu and Ladakh. One year of fund starvation + army rule will create the right conditions in Kashmir for future action !</comment>

<comment>YOU AND GRANDCHILDREN WILL BE DEAD BY THAT TIME</comment>

<comment>Just what our neighbor wants....</comment>

<comment>well said. Let govt act sternly on those separatists.</comment>
