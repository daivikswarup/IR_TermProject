By Sanjeeva ShiveshBihar is once again at a cusp. It has to decide the political leader who will craft its destiny for the next five years.For the last 25 years, two leaders -- Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar -- have left their own stamp on the state in different ways. Lalu’s regime was a period of turbulence. While the socio-political balance shifted from upper/forward castes to the backward castes, crime rate increased, administrative system got denigrated and economic development took a back-seat. Most experts have label this as jungle raj.Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kuma. PTIIn this backdrop, Nitish Kumar’s non-communal image and development- oriented appeal mattered. In 2005, the state voted for the Nitish Kumar-led NDA. He brought the agenda of governance and economic development to the centre stage.This article is a quick dissection of some of the claims of economic achievements during Nitish’s rule. Bihar, which languished in the 1990-2005 period, started hitting headlines for right reasons. Nitish supporters claim that during 2005-14, the state registered fast growth and its performance was the best among the BIMARU states.Economic performance can be evaluated through four critical parameters – growth in the state’s gross domestic product, rise in per capita income, job creation and the overall investment outlook.Impressive GDP growthBihar’s GDP at current prices increased from Rs 77,781 crore in 2004-05 to Rs 3,43,663 crore in 2013-14, implying an impressive CAGR of 17.9 percent.During the same period, its share in Indian GDP grew. Bigger states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh clocked growth rates of 15.2 percent, 16.2 percent, 16.8 percent and 14.2 percent respectively. Uttarakhand, carved out of BIMARU Uttar Pradesh, clocked the highest CAGR of 19.5 percent.Nitish Kumar claimed that Bihar grew much faster than Modi’s Gujarat model. However, we have to bear in mind that a high growth rate on a small base is not unsurprising. In fact, the size of Bihar’s economy now is still smaller than Maharashtra’s economy in 2003-04.The contribution of Bihar’s share to Indian economy increased from 2.6 percent to 3.3 percent. But the share of Maharashtra, India’s number 1-state in terms of economy, also increased from 13 percent to 14 percent in the same period.Per capita income vis-à-vis other statesThe state’s GDP ultimately translates into income for the residents. The table below shows changes in per capita income for Bihar and other comparator states.<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2476068" src="http://s4.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BiharState.jpg" alt="BiharState" width="620" height="187" />Clearly, Bihar has logged an impressive performance by almost doubling its per capita income in the last 10 years. But, states like Haryana and Goa have outperformed Bihar.The table also shows, Bihar lagging Madhya Pradesh by 10 years and India by 15 years. No wonder, Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser to the government of India asked Bihar to maintain its tempo of rapid growth for at least two decades if it aspired to join the league of developed states.Absence of economic centre other than PatnaDistrict wise analysis of per capita income in Bihar shows that while Patna has an impressive Rs 63,063 per capita income, the other districts have been laggards. The next three districts are Munger, Begusarai and Bhagalpur at about Rs 20,000. Sheohar at Rs 7092 is at the bottom.In the last 10 years, the per capita income of Patna has grown by six times, while rest of the state has grown by 1.5 to 2 times only. This not only reflects skewed development in Bihar but also absence of opportunities in other regions of the state.Unchecked migrationWhen opportunities are low and governance is poor, people leave their villages and towns in search of better life. Between 1991 and 2001, 22.47 lakh people migrated out of Bihar and the population swelled by 185 lakh to 830 lakh. Most migrating people move to Delhi (20 percent), West Bengal (16 percent), Uttar Pradesh (10.5 percent), Maharashtra (10 percent), and Punjab (7.5 percent).According to the Delhi Human Development Report - 2013, In 2011, Biharis constituted 30.7 percent of the people migrating into Delhi, up from 13.6 percent in 2001.An estimated 55 lakh people migrated out of Bihar between 2001 and 2011, while the population increased by 211 lakh to 1,041 lakh in the corresponding period. This implies that one out of every four person added between 2001 and 2011 moved out of the state. This is a severe indictment for Nitish Kumar’s economic story.Negative job growthThe absence of job opportunities is also visible from lack of job growth.The total number of jobs in the organized sector in Bihar actually declined by whopping 25 percent -- from 494,000 to 396,000 -- between 2004 and 2011.What is surprising is jobs in government sector have reduced from 362,000 to 270,000. This is while in India there has been a general increase in organized sector jobs from 264.6 lakh in 2004 to 289.9 lakh in 2011. Jharkhand, the neighboring state, has managed to increase jobs by 50 percent during the same period from 11.9 lakh to 18.7 lakh.The worse part of Bihar’s employment story is the missing private sector. A large state like it has only about 26,000 people employed in private sector. This is worse than smaller states like Goa and Haryana.Employment in organised sector<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2476076" src="http://s1.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BiharState2.jpg" alt="BiharState2" width="620" height="238" />Similarly, the labour participation in workforce is also abysmally low.Worker participation rate (Source: Bihar Economic Survey)<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2476082" src="http://s1.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bihar4.jpg" alt="Bihar4" width="620" height="104" />While the 45 percent in the 15-55 age group work in India, it is less than 30 percent for Bihar. One of the important reasons for this is near absence of women in economic sphere. Unless, opportunities are created for women, Bihar will continue to languish.ConclusionWhile credit should go to Nitish Kumar for bringing the law and order situation under control, Bihar’s economy lags Indian economy by about 15 years. If it has to achieve an important position in India’s economy, then it must focus on a development model that creates jobs for all. The private sector is almost missing in Bihar economy, with not even a handful of large or medium industries to be counted. In a nutshell, it has a long way to go.
