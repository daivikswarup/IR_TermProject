<comment>Andhra Moved out in time to Hyderabad as it was Capital In times Andhra will moved to their Permanent abode Amravati. It is painful in 1947 india division or 1950s AP state or 2016. But in about 5 yrs it is forgotten</comment>

<comment>They should have shifted capital to Nagpur.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Regarding, from another article in firstpost "It may be pointed out that the Modi government had tried to follow the UPA government’s decision which had been scrapped by the top court. It filed a review petition but the court dismissed it."Then Modi and Rajnath Singh is squarely responsible for the situation by building hopes. They better commit suicide. After a person has committed suicide in morality he is just a useless weight on earth, and a waste for his food consumed.Even electorally also it WILL not fetch or retain votes - as Bihar elections proved. Predicting electoral results was impossible as human mind is most fluid thing on earth and basing moral position on electoral outcomes is not work of genius but down right silly.========================================================================Modi yielding is disastrous[Copying congress will certainly bring back congress or some thing even worse] - shift capital to Nagpur if required, as British did. No Yadav voted for Modi in Bihar. Rather vote of Yadavs moved away to their caste leader Laloo, after Modi and Rajnath Singh appeared soft. Say Nothing doing - stir will die down.Be Bold like Abraham Lincoln and scrap reservation policy - else a heavy price of endless civil war has to be paid. Constitution of India is anti-national. One should be vary of king of vicious consensus politics Vajpayee's Gandhian Socialism[MK Gandhi sold his supporters, Hindus, to unsuccessfully win over the heart of Jinnah and Muslims and Socialism is legal robbery].------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rajiv Goswami was the first student to attempt self-immolation while a student at Delhi University in October, 1990 to protest against Prime Minister V.P. Singh's implementation of the Mandal Commission laws for Affirmative Action (reservation) recommendations. His action sparked a series of self-immolations by college students and led to a formidable movement against job reservations for backward castes, as recommended by the Mandal CommissionSurinder Singh Chauhan was the first student to perform self-immolation while an evening student of Deshbandhu College (Delhi University) on September 24, 1990 to protest against implementation of the Mandal Commission recommendation for reservation to candidates based on birth. He left a suicide note stating that "The responsibility for my death lies with those people who consider reservation a vote bank, people like V.P. Paswan, Yadav--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------International professor,Professors of JNU, Jadhavpur, President of India, Supreme court Judges Election commission , let me judge you. Nuremburg trial said to Nazis, why did you not commit suicide, when they took the defense that they were just doing their duty.I say soul of post 1947 India is murder of INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS of merit by reservation policy + and murder of property rights by socialism. Anyone volunteering to commit suicide as they are serving a fake democracy and an ocholocracy [mob rule]? Just voting does not make a democracy - protection of Individual rights [the smallest minority rights]makes a country democratic and free.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now BJP/RSS should be creative, PROACTIVE,  and bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics. USA experience shows that goons kill each other in presence of free gun laws. None will kill with a legal weapon.2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=============================================What if some Indians want to screww mother and Indians want to screww motherland?? Is this the reason why Indian men have difficulty in have girl friends and India does not want to get involved in wars outside India, and is deeply INWARD looking?Sigmund Freud father of psychoanalysis said "mother worship" when asked to define India. Continuing this analysis::Arnab Goswami goes slightly wrong when he says even left loves India. Love non-mediated by religion turns motherly love to love for female. That is why Left is intent of screwwing India. That love is sexual love for mother, motherland. Jats and Kapus in Andhra Pradesh[who have burnt a train] are demanding reservation. That is again immoral sexual love for motherland.Such effect of predatory sexual love for motherland [nothing wrong with motherly love]has even led to murder of motherland in history as following shows..Dahir was BRAHMIN King in Sindh. By enlisting the support of local tribes (such as the Jats, Meds and Bhuttos) and Buddhist rulers of Nerun, Bajhra, Kaka Kolak and Siwistan as infantry to his predominantly-mounted army, Muhammad bin Qasim defeated Dahir and captured his eastern territories for the Umayyad Caliphate.Dahir then tried to prevent Qasim from crossing the Indus River, moving his forces to its eastern banks. Eventually, however, Qasim crossed and defeated forces at Jitor led by Jaisiah (Dahir's son). Qasim fought Dahir at Raor (near modern Nawabshah) in 712, killing him; Dahir's wife immolated herself (with other women in her household) in accordance with the Hindu tradition of Jauhar.=========================================================Academicians have swallowed a fascist lie spread by media that India is a democracy.What a Joke! What about the assault on Individual right of merit by reservation policy? In which country are cities brought to a halt by bandhs? Media should first say India was a Ocholocracy[mob rule].India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] not a democracy. Free speech can be explosive unless it is a part of movement to uproot the Ocholocracy. In a Ocholocracy INDIVIDUAL rights are murdered by definition with help of state. Examples of murder of INDIVIDUAL right are reservation policy which is murder of merit, an INDIVIDUAL right and socialism(by definition legal robbery) which is murder property right, another INDIVIDUAL right.Why are Indians not trusted with free gun laws as in USA? Answer to this simple question demolishes free speech argument.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why were leftists associated with secessionists? The culture of socialist legal robbery is manifesting itself as secessionism - because the socialists may have realized it is impossible to come to an understanding on who the supreme dictator should be and they want to establish numerous single part dictatorships over fragments of country. Socialism has to lead to single party dictatorships over fragments of country.Adam Smith, the father of economics, says in economics Man Proposes and God Disposes. If every body in a nation become do-gooders -- God disposes -- and we will have hell on earth. if man proposes to be selfish -- God again disposes -- and we will have prosperity and peace.Giving rational explanation of God, the elder do-gooders , MK Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Ambedkar etc forgot that a strong socialist state is required to do good. And it will demand its pound of flesh closest to the heart – rampant corruption. A strong state emerges in an environment of shortages – to distribute scant resources. Any socialist state will NOT destroy the reason for its existence. 24 hour water supply will reduce water required to be released by 30%. No Government Engineer in India will accept this. Scarcity, distress is required for the reason for its existence. If no scarcity exists it will manufacture it. Mysore had water scarcity even though it had KRS dam beside it. It is a question of power. A society can either have equality or freedom but never both. Why? To enforce equality a strong and intrusive state is required. Stateism is against Individualism and kills freedom.Since 1947, the political parties, government need not care as they have attained emancipation from democracy -- principally by the tool of reservation policy, where vote banks are formed. And they will vote according to predictable patterns whatever the rulers do or don't do. In other words India has become a Fascist state[socialism is a necessary component of it --Nazi means National Socialist]by the vehicle of reservation policy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just voting does not make India democracy. Protection of rights of the smallest minority the INDIVIDUAL MAKES A SYSTEM DEMOCRATIC. The problem is, India is an Ocholocracy[mob rule] where Individual rights are murdered[example is murder of merit an Individual right by reservation policy and property rights by socialism. Socialism is legal robbery.A period of good dictatorship may be required to cure Indians of disease of bad democracy, due to the infection of socialism or legal robbery. Otherwise bad democracy can kill in millions like in Cambodia under Pol Pot. Ocholocracy looks like democracy but it is not. Just look at immorality of Indians- Laloo the reason for largest migration of Biharis from Bihar was reelected.-----------------------------------------------------------It is logically wrong to allow communist parties to function in a multi party democracy as they are for single party dictatorship - they openly state it! Ban communist parties===================================================Rohit Vemula was also a goon who assaulted ABVP person. They are from the ruling gang [as subset of population]. They are pro-reservation. Perhaps Rohit vemula recognized the emptiness of his life and committed suicide.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------When a person scores above 94% and another gets same seat for 49% in an EXAMINATION when the examiners dont know the examinees then merit does not exist because it has been murdered. A person who was murdered did exist. So also merit.That is the argument of relative morality of Mixed economy, a fascist economy - because measure and morals is a product of ones upbringing they dont exist. What is only moral is what the Constitution and mafia politicians laws state.Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim’s gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of money taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials and mafia politicians.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, but that it cannot be used honestly.Why does not the state allot a seat strictly on merit and snatch it away OPENLY?------------------------------------------------------------------Quit India movement was anti-white racism and was immoral. It was born of Jihad of MK Gandhi against white skin by support to the utterly undemocratic Khilafat movement. Quit India movement would have been moral only on refusal by the British to form a single nation with one man one vote. We now know father of nation is father of ISIS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------What is more important than his being Anti national is Kanhiyah is not an Individual [rather he is ANTI INDIVIDUAL] - he is a communist [CPI worker], who was[his party] powerful enough to Impose emergency along with Indira Gandhi. He will protest Afzal Guru execuation but he will not say a word on murder of merit an Individual right. Rather he wants people themselves to murder Individual rights so that he can impose his single party collective dictatorship--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</comment>

<comment>This was expected. The people who claim that Hyd is result of their efforts has also damaged the image of Hyderabad during 2009 to 2014. They also called HYD will be second BIHAR.. Only jungle RAJ etc.. The image restoring was done by KTR. CBN is already outdated. He and his son fit for nothing. ANDHRAITES are paying for their past autocrats. They never considered Telangana people as mainstream citizens. From the construction of NAGARJUNA SAGAR to CAPITAL shifting... everything is based on hate. Still being citizen of Telangana I wish your state prospers and shine.</comment>

<comment>Stop sending files to Hyderabad and see how the employees fly out of Hyderabad over night</comment>

<comment>Dude, HVAC stands for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning.</comment>

<comment>It is easy to say for people who dislike articles as media people are biased,untrue but the truth is these are the people who are unable to digest the hard fact</comment>

<comment>Ye author hamare payroll mein hai jee, Jo him kahenge wohi likhega yeh </comment>

<comment>Mr. Saye Sekhar is a very biased gentleman and it is easy to see where his bias lies. Previously also he has denigrated Mr. Naidu's efforts. It would be good if Mr. Saye Sekhar would recall that Hyderabad (the only Jewel of Telangana) owes its status to Mr. Naidu and the people from the coastal belt who catapulted this city to the limelight. Instead of constantly criticising the TDP's efforts, it would be truly gentlemanly for Mr. Saye Sekhar to at least be neutral if not encouraging.</comment>
