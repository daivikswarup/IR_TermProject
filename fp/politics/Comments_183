<comment>Anna ji, you were used by khujli and thrown away. Your value in India is now no more than a used condom. Go back to wherever you came from.</comment>

<comment>Where were you two months ago when Kejriwal endorsed and was campaigning for the MGB?</comment>

<comment>Anna should not be happy.  kejriwal has finished anna. now anna cannot start any campaign.  Anna  can give a try and see how many people support him.</comment>

<comment>kahan hai dkbose kejriwal 4 pm 2019? nachaniya kejri ke darpok dalle anna ne usko chodd diya hai. ab kahan muh leke jayenge aap ke cyber bhadwe?</comment>

<comment>Dear anna,Hindsight is twenty, twenty but anyone would need a hindsight of forty/ forty where kejriwal is concerned, ask any delhite, they would tell you..that being said, you should have long since realized the kind of person kejriwal was, after be backstabbed you multiple times, never mind..On the current comment, spot on and all of us have to be ashamed to have fallen for that kejriwal's lies..</comment>

<comment>Hope Delhi does not fall for Kejriwal's 'Lies' once again in 2020 and give a chance to BJP, like India gave a chance to BJP in May 2014. Also, rather sad that Bihar also fell for that Lalloo ji and that 'liar' Kejriwal ji. Hope the Bihari's also realize their folly and vote for BJP in 2020. Cheers.</comment>

<comment>I know..we wont and hope the Biharis soon realize their folly..do they even know that their deputy cm cannot even utter a whole sentence in english</comment>

<comment>The publicity hungry Anna is the one who gave this Frankenstein Kukliwal legitimacy.</comment>

<comment>Anna, itna mat Hansa-Re. Entire India including AAPtards know what a hypocrite Kejriwal is. Only you were too blind to see. Any who keep flying in chartered plane of Naveen Jindal</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal blatantly exposed his affinity to status quo politics. Long live corrupt, despotic wayward politics.It is good Anna maintained his distance.</comment>

<comment>Anna may pride himself for leaving Arvind and also for leaving RSS. But at that time Anns's utility was finished. History will note that Anna inadvertently(?) make him used by communal forces to grab power. Anna ko ULLU banaya.</comment>

<comment>Use and throw is AK Any doubts that AK is Congress stooge and spy hiding behind AAP.Unfortunately AAPholes can't see this</comment>

<comment>Anna.. I mean.. you did not leave him. He actually dumped you. There is a fundamental difference</comment>

<comment>I mean what is wrong in hugging Laloo. Laloo is now a clean, non-corrupt and a honest person. Anyone who comes in contact with Khujli is immediately and automatically purified. Laloo now has a CERTIFICATE OF HONESTY, issued by none other than Lord Kejriwal.</comment>

<comment>Exactly! Like it is the case with all politicians! Like how the gun totting goonda, Vittal Radadia, and mining scam jailed Yeddyurappa, became clean after kissing Modi's feet.Like I said, all politicians are the same - but only a moditard will defend Radadia etc kissing Modi and making up, while true AAP supporters will condemn Kejriwal for letting Laloo use AAP's capital.</comment>

<comment>Not aware about the Radadia case, but Yeddyurappa was acquitted by the High Court.</comment>

<comment>Thats a lie. HC JUST GAVE HIM BAIL, HIS CASE IS STILL ON.</comment>

<comment>So the very reason AAP came into existence is not to root out corruption.  AAPtards proving at every turn that AAPTard party is just another me too party. I humbly request almighty Kejriwal to relinquish his certification authority.</comment>

<comment>BUT you fell at Barmaid's feet!</comment>

<comment>And the blame goes to Anna for bringing such a shameless creature on indian politiacal front. Kejri is one of the worst things that happened to independent India.</comment>

<comment>Together Anna and Kejru cheated India. No getting away from that, Anna. It's 16 Anna truth.</comment>

<comment>when he was associated with anna and kiran bedi he had even come to a alumi meet in our iit  powai campus we were really proud of him then less then 5  yrs he sucks up to one of the biggest convicted criminal politician in india chara chor</comment>

<comment>Anna is nothing but BJP plant, they used him in weakening the congress.</comment>

<comment>And finally an Aaptard had responded. Sab mile hue hainji. Even kejriwal and rahul gandhi r bjp plants made to destroy congress. </comment>

<comment>Hahaha! What senser you possess! Great!</comment>

<comment>Wait for some more days .... he will blame you also for corruption.</comment>

<comment>He used Anna for furtherence of his political ambition, and now he dumped him. When are u hugging Vadra and Rahul and Raja.....</comment>

<comment>Where r the Aaptards? Plz enlighten us with ur useless opinions.</comment>

<comment>it is sad ANNA REALIZED THIS ONLY NOW anna should also know that the people who destroyed the anna movement are today the close friends of his one time confidant kejariwal</comment>

<comment>His happiness in 'leaving Arvind' is misplaced. It is his once dear chela Arvind who used him and hijacked his movement to float a political party. Today Arvind has no use for him.</comment>

<comment>Only Samajwaad can save India , not Congress pseudo secularism or BJP Hindutva or AAP fake anti corruption , jai samajwaad, jai Mulayam !</comment>

<comment>For years SP has been known for its goonda-raj. I hope you know that. People felt a little peaceful when BSP and/or Mayavati beat Mulayam to power. I am not sure what Samajwaad does SP and Mulayam follow and what you are supporting.</comment>

<comment>please elaborate your definition of samajwaad</comment>

<comment>You see samajwaad and samosawaad are quiet the same in India.You eat the Samosa by putting chutney on it in Samosawad, in Samajwad you eat samaj by puting chutney on it.</comment>

<comment>sorry to say.. he used you Anna and dumped you like toilet paper... just to get right prespective</comment>

<comment>Kyo Anna ko bolte ho Jafar,Anna kya karega patra.! Anna ek badmaash ko kada kiya!</comment>

<comment>Sing more praises of Fekriwal now.</comment>

<comment>AK has already used and dumped Anna. Now he is thinking of ways and means to use Nitish and lalu, then only he can become PM. Where is corrution in this ?</comment>

<comment>Our media has already nominated Nitiswa our next PM! How did Kejru figure in it?</comment>

<comment>Anna should have recognized Kejeriwal much earlier, why was he keeping mum when he left his Govt job with out paying his Education leave loan amount, when he forced Anna to say there is lot of corruption in Gujarat after once praising Modi's work, when he joined congress to capture Govt in Delhi, when he betrayed Anna and came in politics. Mr. Kejeriwal has shrewd political ambition to gain by hook or by crook. </comment>

<comment>Anna was too a simpleton to recognize Indian politician in kujliwal.</comment>

<comment>From the video it appears that smiling Kejriwal walked up to Lalu and hugged and joined in the vortex of corruption.</comment>

<comment>aaptards should now also keep lalus photo beside khujliwals while worshipping their rajneetik raas leela</comment>

<comment>chacha jaagooookejriwal aapko bahut pahle topi pehane ke nikal chuka hai</comment>

<comment>Next hug, Vadra and the cycle is complete.</comment>

<comment>And tum dekhte rah jaavoge.</comment>

<comment>It is already going on in background.</comment>

<comment>While we are still waiting for the CCTV cameras in every street in Delhi.</comment>

<comment>Now Nitish Laloo will send truck loaded with Biharis as a gift to Delhi</comment>

<comment>You are insulting Bihari diaspora, who contribute to Bihar economy by sending money orders. Sorry! No more money orders. DD only!</comment>

<comment>lol</comment>

<comment>Arrey Budhau,Do you even matter these days? You have decided that you will not learn. It is not that you left Arvind. It is Arvind Jisne tumhari gaaand pe laat maari. Sudhar ja re. </comment>

<comment>nice learnings by khujliwal, way to go. #aamaadmispoliticalavtar</comment>

<comment>yes arvind ko abhi unki zaroorat nahi abhi to unke laloo jaise clean politics wale dost hai</comment>
