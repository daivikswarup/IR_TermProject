Earlier surveys have been rather conclusive in predicting the success of the BJP-led alliance in the upcoming Bihar election, but the CNN-IBN Axis survey predicts that the Nitish Kumar government may just get to stay on in the state.According to the survey here's how the parties could fare in terms of vote share: The Bihar polls are to be held in five phases starting from 12 October ending on 5 November. The counting will be on 8 November.The survey predicts that the JD(U)-RJD-Congress alliance will finish with 137 seats, the BJP and its allies will finish with 95 seats and other parties will finish 11 seats.Here's how the various social groups are expected to vote:The JD(U)-led alliance is also seen doing better across various age demographics, the survey, in which over 24,000 respondents were polled across the 243 constituencies of the state, said. For the survey, 87 percent of the respondents were from rural areas while only 13 percent were from urban areas.The Lokniti-CSDS pre-poll survey had said that Nitish Kumar was the state's most preferred candidate for chief minister. An earlier report by Firstpost had said that  if elections could be won on the basis of popularity alone, Nitish would win hands down.However, Nitish's popularity has gone down considerably since his tie-up with RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav. The negative impact of the company Nitish has chosen was also evident in the India Today–Cicero opinion poll. The poll showed that Nitish  is still the best candidate for chief minister, but the NDA might just pull off a win.But while Nitish may have been attacked for joining hands with Lalu for the polls, the CNN-IBN Axis survey reveals that 42 percent respondents actually thought it would benefit Nitish, while 39 percent said it wouldn't.The survey also found that a majority of its respondents wanted Nitish to continue as the chief minister: When asked about the basis on which people cast their votes, most people said that they were influenced by the performance of the state government.When asked about Nitish Kumar's achievements, a whopping 38 percent mentioned women empowerment, 19 percent chose development, 18 percent said reduction on crime, 15 percent mentioned good governance and 10 percent said it was better education.But this is how they thought the state government has met its expectations:However, not everything is rosy for Nitish, with 45 percent of the respondents saying he failed to check corruption when asked about the failures of his government. Also 27 percent chose slow growth of jobs as one of the other failures, 15 percent were of the opinion that he promoted casteism and 13 percent said that he ignored farmers.And as both the NDA and Grand Alliance leaders are busy with feverish campaigning across Bihar, when asked what influences them the most to vote 21 percent respondents said rallies by big leaders, 19 percent said it was the election manifesto, 18 percent said it was television news, 16 percent chose social media and 12 percent said local campaigns.
