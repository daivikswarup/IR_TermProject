<comment>Captain Pawan Kumar, a true soldier and patriot, was laying down his life on a battleground, fighting the real enemies of India in order to keep the Tricolour flying in Kashmir. He was a Jat from Haryana. He had studied at JNU.......His last philosophical words: Kisikoreservation chahiye toh kisiko azadi bhai. Humein kuchh nahin chahiye bhai.Bas apni razai. How can we pay for terrorists like Umar at JNU?</comment>

<comment>Ghoomne ke bade saukeen hai yeah....</comment>

<comment>This is the best you can come up with ....</comment>

<comment>The kind of energy that Modi has brought to the office of the Prime Minister is quite unparalleled. Full marks to him for hard work and committment.</comment>

<comment>Ghoomne ke bade saukeen hai yeah........</comment>

<comment>Many senior executives in the corporate sector have similar schedules.I end up working the Sunday once every quarter or so, which is not much, but a close relative, who is at a senior level with the Reliance Mobile telephony business in the projects department for almost a decade now, pretty much works every Sunday.Same with the guys at Senior levels in all departments and at all levels in the project department of a small Steel Mill I worked with in South India.Same with guys in project departments of another company in a totally unrelated sector whom I'm dealing with at the moment.I wonder if any IT types work on the Sunday, would be good to hear from them.</comment>

<comment>Ghoomne ke bade saukeen hai yeah.</comment>

<comment>Even in some PSUs at least 20% of the staff works from 09 to 08 six days a week and at least 2 Sundays every month</comment>

<comment>Ghoomne ke bade saukeen hai yeah..,</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the inputs, Rahul. I believe ISRO would be one of them. Project department people also end up working very long hours.</comment>

<comment>IT types might look fancy from the outside, people think they draw huge salaries and spend like hell.. it is not a complete picture... not all are fully paid as per market, they are made to work like hell.. sometimes even missing weekends.. especially during deadlines... which are always there..Each job has its complexities sir... outsiders might not have a perspective of it..Even those relaxed 'Government jobs' are now getting a little bit (no as compared to corporate sector) accountable.</comment>

<comment>Bottom line, IT Types also work on the Sundays, that was my short point, but since I don't work in IT, wanted someone who does to comment as such.I worked out the present IT conundrum 15 / 16 years ago, @ Y2K, when, having passed BE Mech. in the mid to late 90s, I successfully completed a course in Oracle 8.x with D2K as FE. India was agog with the Y2K revolution at the time, people who hadn't seen the gates of an engineering school or couldn't put together a sentence in English (which is the language of business in the US), were doing a COBOL / PASCAL course and ending up at Miami to fight the impending Y2K monster, which later on proved to be a rather elaborate bubble.Around the same time, having appeared for the (much simpler at the time) Common Entrance Test, I decided to ignore my exposure to s/w and pursue an MBA and the consequent career.Some of my friends in IT have done well, some haven't, but generally, I don't see anyone leading an IT business, coming from an outside discipline, like Mechanical or Electrical, unless from an IIT - IIM kind of a background.Whereas, I do envisage Engineers, from their own disciplines, with requisite drive and capability finally leading businesses or at least divisions in their fields, even if not from IIT.An average engineer, would draw average salaries.The IT paychecks were hugely inflated because the number of hands required for an IT business were woefully short till about 10 years ago. With everyone opting for a BE / B.Tech. Comp. Sc., this supply gap has been fulfilled.The IT paychecks are still apparently @ 1.5 times  higher than say manufacturing, but a job in IT probably demands 1.5 times more working hours, so the rate per hour pretty much remains the same.</comment>

<comment>How impressive. I'm sure no other politician in Indian history has had such a tight schedule, especially in the face of impending elections in one of India's politically most important states.Above all the first Prime Minster of Independent India, woke up at the crack of dawn all his adult life and while he did not spend his entire time talking about and conducting yoga events, he practiced yoga himself, including the extremely difficult, Shirshasana, which the average, unfit, pot bellied politicians of India cannot even dream of doing. Including Nehru's great grandson, the joke foisted upon India by the Congress.However, why write about such inconvenient facts pertaining to Pandit Nehru, which will anger what passes for 'nationalists' today, much better to write about his peccadiloes with Lady Edwina Mountbatten, a lady notorious across Europe for her sex life. </comment>

<comment>"A short nap on the flight is, perhaps, the only way you relax on a Sunday when you are a prime minister of a country like India; and a weekend with a luxury to watch an old Hrishikesh Mukherjee movie and listen to some soothing classic old numbers, with a cup of coffee, is certainly a distant dream."It was definitely not a distant dream for our past PM Maunmohan Singh. He had all the time in the world and more.</comment>

<comment>Hahahaha, where? How? In washing Sonia's Kitchen utensils or polishing Rahul's Shoes? The country did not benefit from his hard work. Only the Italian Mafia amassed wealth.</comment>

<comment>Rahul is it in your name that all Rahuls are Stupid?</comment>

<comment>Did I say anything personal to you?</comment>

<comment>India does not deserve a PM like Modi. At least they realized their mistakes for voting first for Nehru a white women fascinated having an affair with the First Lady at that time, he only handled one state and he screwed it up J&K, lost land to Pakistan and China, lost to China, then Indira who destroyed he national fabric and broke the systems so that she can impose emergency. There goes 34 years of independent India. Then a pussy guy who got married to an Italian white barmaid spy where Sinia lived as an Ialian Citizen in Top Secret PM house for 15 years. There goes another 6 years of Rajiv rule. Then we have Sonia running this country for 10 years remotely using NAC and puppy dog MMS not even barking but getting the country being looted. There goes another 10 years. Now we have a PM who saw that India was dirty. He started Swacch Bharat and instead of supporting they want to find faults with him. So you are telling me that the PM should not address real problems which we have? PM works hard. He is non corrupt. His ministers are working hard. Now they claim only 34% of India voted for him? So? That is the power of democracy and you don't like a PM who is hard working and making a difference then you are more than welcome to move where you want. There are 60 Muslim countries which will love you to migrate there.</comment>

<comment>the pm is totally dedicated to one goal :  to help the poor people of india to develop skills for themselves and work themselves into middle class of a swatchh (which also means corrupt-congress mukta) bharat.</comment>

<comment>if anti hindu PAppu gandhi becomes our PM then he will give all his responsibilty to his chamchas and will play video games and watch chota bheem whole day.</comment>

<comment>Not just that Hindus will become minority in  many more states. Like MM Singh said Minority has first right on resources than Hindus. There are no. of traitor in Hindus e. g. Rahul, AK, Mamta, Prakash Karat, Lalu, Sarad Pawar, Rajdeep. These people are Anti-Hindu.</comment>

<comment>Had our earlier PMs had at least 1/100th part of this PM's energy and spent as little as 1/60th part of the time spent by this PM, one could imagine what India would be today amongst world ranking.  Certainly we would have been somewhere on the top three, if not at the top.Instead running away to Mexico to enter into ecstacy of drugs or to a secluded country for yogic lessons to re-energise to be vituperative, the people longing  impatiently and all the more intolerantly to be the future PMs, they should learn at least some of the principled life this PM leads.As this is unlikely, hope this PM continues to be elected at least for two decades or atleast a decade and half to resurrect the nation from its current decaying status both morally and economically.</comment>

<comment>Hard working pm...salute</comment>

<comment>Incredible guy, a true pradhan sevak of the country. Hats off to him. And he has been doing this non-stop for the last 21 months since becoming PM in Delhi.</comment>

<comment>2800 KM in a day... and he is 65 yrs old.. Fk..and I wasted my day m@sturbating n watching p0rn..</comment>

<comment>one can be against or for Modiji's politics and governance. But his energy is an inspiration and ideal for all Indian youth</comment>

<comment>Many don't know but our PM Modi when he was cm never took a single day off for almost 5000 days ! That's from 2001 to 2014 without any day off ! Now he is doing same thing as PM not taken a single day off after swearing in as PM ! To do so it takes a lot of love , passion n commitment towards country !</comment>

<comment>Were you posted at his office or residence? </comment>

<comment>Were you?</comment>

<comment>Where do you see me certifying him?</comment>

<comment>Where are you taking it on face value?</comment>

<comment>You have a point here. So lets agree that we can neither agree nor disagree that he is a superman?</comment>

<comment>hahaha. Agreed. But He didnt say he is a superman either</comment>

<comment>Article portrays him as something like superman only. Yes he is a hard worker, yes he is a frugal eater. But not a superman</comment>

<comment>But you cannot bias your comment about whom its being written. This precedent is the reason for instability in India. We see, we read, we interpret, we ass-ume and then we write/ spread incorrect information.....thats how the fire starts</comment>

<comment>Can't disagree with that. We believe what we want to believe.</comment>

<comment>the way we are going we will end up having a PM who will take 53 days leave after every 1 year of hard work: which includes talking nonsense, sporting beard to look mature and thoughtful, giving solid advice to  college students on how to run governments through sheer bluster....etc....and we know...MSM already love this guy!!</comment>

<comment>Very hard working Government. Its good that the hit jobs by Media and congress started too early in Modis tenure and already people have started wary of these hit jobs. The development outcome of his efforts are there to see already and people are getting convinced of his conviction and comitment.</comment>

<comment>Feku PM narendra-modis- himself is restless, gruelling,  unreliable and  biggest lair as prove by his failed marriage and public jumlas ACCHYEDIN  for corrupt businessmen and bureaucrats.</comment>

<comment>15lakh CCTV is not jumla which is part of manifesto. feku did not tell he will deposit but said he used 15lalk to quantify black money. people also comment on his foreign trip but they never understand how much. time need to put in to make them success. </comment>

<comment>What about extramarital relationships of nehru..with many ladies  Indira with mo mathaiRajeev with ambika soniN sonia with madhaw rao scindia</comment>

<comment>why are you commenting about his marriage. He is P.M of the nation, look at his work.</comment>

<comment>They can only attack and make it personal since these guys hate seeing a hard working noncorrupt PMof a strong India. Strong PM hardworking PM noncorrupt PM is not good for Paki and terrorists.</comment>

<comment>Better watch neerja than doing bakchodi all over India...and AK bhai watch deadpool it's good</comment>

<comment>You do what you have to do may be masturbate or attack or blow yourself up. It's your choice</comment>

<comment>god bless my pm my hero</comment>

<comment>He loves it. We love him.God bless him with energy to bring this country to forefront.His passion for India is true and great. He is not a politician but a lover of IndiaBala</comment>

<comment>Hope God blesses him to continue like this for a long time ..India needs him</comment>

<comment>Meanwhile..Kejriwal watches movies every weekend. Yesterday he watched Neerja.</comment>

<comment>did he stopped reviewing movies on twitter. he is the first CM to become freelance reviewer.</comment>

<comment>What's your problem with That?</comment>

<comment>no personal problem as such..i am just giving out information to the public which may or may not be indicative or how hard people are working.</comment>

<comment>a very big problem with a foulmouthed nautanki.. whose only two jobs are to review movies and abuse Modi/BJP for every thing even his cough and constipation</comment>

<comment>The fact that he promised free water for delhi so as to get the votes and as of today, we are bone dry..care to explain that or is that a tad too much literal..aapturd</comment>

<comment>What are u.. an expert on foreign affairs or expert in finance or industries or anything else worthy.. to give ur opinion in one line.. </comment>

<comment>LOL or so you would have us believe..thank god, we still have our brains intact and don't believe in any of the bakwass you post here.Incidentally, your bakwass leader promised continuous water supply and as of today has closed all of delhi's schools due to acute water shortage..bakwass promises will only get you more bakwass, and NO results..better perform before you make moronic comments of the sort you'd posted above aapturd..</comment>

<comment>He said free water right... Now there is no water.? </comment>

<comment>YES..that about sums it up perfectly..</comment>

<comment>Prime Minister, Modi will speak extempore and every speech is expected to have a different flavour and perspective on governance and policy making, what, is this author out of his mind? For any one who has listened to Modi's speeches, only one flavour, subject is enough for him, which he keeps on parroting i.e comparison of congiees 60 years to his 2 years.Moreover my dear author, if you refer historical data you will find itinerary of LBS, Indira, Vajpayee & MMS much more gruelling for the sake of India than Modi's, which leans to self glorification/gratification and partly for India.</comment>

<comment>Well said. </comment>

<comment>Nice joke. Kapil Sharma do you have any opening for this joker? Well sorry he is a liar since he making up things like MMS traveling. Oh yeah MMS used to go every day to Madams house to deliver the loot.</comment>

<comment>yes Ak was working very hard in bangalore with no portfolio just to spread aap across India. actually Ak is not working by own choice. he will be there across India wherever some thing goes against Bjp with tax of Delhi. </comment>

<comment>we need more comments from you on kejriwal's work as well along with Modi's... we all appreciate your comment.... talk about results of Kejriwal also...</comment>

<comment>Dear aapturd, thanks for the laughs and hey, feel free to be as deluded as you would like to be but the reality is that kejriwal is, to date, the most incompetent cm and that's with lalu in the running..kudos..</comment>

<comment>For 10 years Khajuriwala was the Asst Comm of IT and yet he didn't do nothing not a single cleaning of IT. What else you expect from a guy who stayed in Delhi and Sonia wrote a letter so that he does not get transferred. </comment>

<comment>Now, we know the real reason why Pappu didn't become PM in UPA regime...bloody kaamchor..</comment>

<comment>I sometimes wonder if what Kejriwal thinks about him is Really True???</comment>

<comment>I think Modi knows he wont remain PM for long. So he wants to maximize the number of places he sees when he is still PM</comment>

<comment>It is the clear expression of your mentality.</comment>

<comment>It is clear expression of your guilt</comment>

<comment>You can always vote for Congress. No one is stopping you just like if you want to blow yourself up for those 72 whores in hell.</comment>

<comment>He is doing for farmers, villages, common Indian , dalits & many more. Many comments against him but I wanna know any politician in current time India has any comparison with him?? If you think someone has please mention him.</comment>

<comment>This comment is awaiting moderation. Show comment.</comment>

<comment>It has started</comment>

<comment>Nice try. If I think of terrorism only Muslims comes to my mind. Or when I think of worldwide child molestation only Christians comes to my mind. Is that a fair comparison. You cannot say 99% of terrorists are Muslims but Muslims are not 99% terrorists? By the way Gandhiji was also what you defined pure vegetarian no alcohol hard working and so on. Are you comparing with Hitler? Shame on you. Mother Teresa was also vegetarian after coming to India and no alcohol. Is she also Hitler like?</comment>

<comment>No one at least for next 10 years and we will be the biggest fool if we vote otherwise...</comment>

<comment>Why don't you enumerate a few things delivered by him for farmers and poor people?</comment>

<comment>crop insurance and he has already distributed drought compensation to farmers but karnatak govt not distributing it </comment>

<comment>Give 1/10th the time given to morons.......</comment>

<comment>That's what the problem is: we were sleeping for last 60 years and blindly supporting the Looting congress government and never asked a simple question that even subsidies were not being delivered appropriately and now we want everything be changed in 2 years. At least show some respect and patience things have started changing... To start with we today are the fastest growing economy (i don't know if you know it or not) which will be stronger if GST is allowed by mom & son govt of 44 MP's. Fasal Bima Yojna has been started, Insurance is made available even to the poorest as low as Rs. 1.1.86 lakh bullet proof jackets are ordered for our Army which is scheduled to go high.Make in India is the biggest and strongest point among others.</comment>

<comment>well the upcoming fasal bima yojna  and online marketing and linking of mandis will be a game changer...just gv time like you have given to morons of congress</comment>

<comment>game changer like Black Money???</comment>

<comment>For farmers: soil health card, latest Fasal bima Yojana, PM sinchai Yojana, villages electrification, neen coated urea, sugar cane farmers package , DBT in fertilizer subsidy, many more</comment>

<comment>These are all Congress schemes re-packaged by Modi</comment>

<comment>If congress had implemented.. there would have been no reason for repackaging....... announcement does not not make reality...Soil Health card... Cong did not do....Fasal Bima yojna-20% coverPM sinchai yojna.. not even announced by CongVillage electrification.. announced in 1971 by Congress..not doneNeem coated... ribbon cutting done few years ago--- no progress.... more than 90% done... will be 100% this yearSuagr cane package.... cong never bothered.... concieved and delivered....DBT fertilizer... still nascent... being planned..... Cong did not think even.What schemes are repackaged....can you eloborate please</comment>

<comment>But they were never visible as well as beneficial to public, now they are visible as well as beneficial to the needy people...</comment>

<comment>SRINI UR HEAD IS DOING VANVAS IN UR AZZ. KINDLY TAKE IT OUT N SEE D SUNSHINE</comment>

<comment>Hahahaha can you  name original  name of thesw schemes  don't  lie like master  khujli  free electricity  Hahahha  fooling  foils like  Srinivas. Honest  liars  did not  proved any of his claims  yet everyday  new lies  to  hide old ones what  a honest  liars.</comment>

<comment>People working hard are not necessarily good. Those who work smart are great. Delegation is name of the game but that is something autocrats hate to do. Is hard work the only required qualification or quality of PM? This is also a symptom of a leader who is suffering greatly with talent deficit. In our case, PM has chosen to do so. Many talented guys within his party are sidelined so that he and his cronies can call all the shots.</comment>

<comment>Can u quote... what has not been delegated... who was delegating..... can you be more specific than Rahul Gandhi please....</comment>

<comment>u have completely lost it...</comment>

<comment>You were always lost since you became a Blind Bhakth</comment>

<comment>you have commented without knowing the facts of the case.. the only facts available is his itinerary which shows that he is working super hard.. rest whether this is something which could be delegated is something one can only comment after having an idea of what he is doing..</comment>

<comment>Our PM has to cover 1.3 billion population. He is working in manner which is understood by common Indian persons. He is innovative in pragati session & policy making.</comment>

<comment>But he has made more foreign Trips than local Trips. Do most Indians live abroad???</comment>

<comment>Rahul Gandhi lived abroad until being  PM candidate.. 3 months abroad... with no reason... Modi is going abroad for work..... He could have spent weekend looking at NIrja like Kejriwal even......</comment>

<comment>so india should only communicate with Indians??.. no one else.. yes he is having a fantastic times living on the flight and maybe hotel rooms in different places.. this is why he does all this trips.. he wants to post the most reviews on trip advisor.. you have finally understood why millions of people support him..</comment>

<comment>Is Acche Din promised for Indians or Foreigners?? Is Hugging = Communicating??? Is making fool of oneself abroad = Acche Din???</comment>

<comment>There is no need to work like this. PM has whole machinery of government with him. What matters is quality of decisions. I understand that India is a complex and huge country and it is not easy for any PM. But trumpeting does not help as much as real delivery on ground.</comment>

<comment>For successful delivery on grounds , trumpeting is required. It basic step of government policies highlight. If government doesn't do publicity how can it get success?</comment>

<comment>delivery is 3 crore bank accounts in 10 yrs....keep going...</comment>

<comment>Our PM very hardworking no doubt..</comment>

<comment>People working hard are not necessarily good. Those who work smart are great. Delegation is name of the game but that is something autocrats hate to do. Is hard work the only required qualification or quality of PM?</comment>

<comment>I agree he should have something like NAC of Sonia and  have few left wingers and allow them to run govt....</comment>

<comment>Right ! Like Mannu Kaka (a.k.a MMS, that family slave of G Family), who had delegated everything - so that all Congi's and their Allies could plunder at will as long as the G Family got a cut ! </comment>

<comment>If you know many innovative ways without hardworking please mention & suggest.</comment>

<comment>Hard working not enough. Many things which he can delegate but wants to do himself. Many ribbon cutting he can avoid.</comment>

<comment>I had thought he would bring pleasure and happiness on the faces of the downtrodden poor, women, aged. I had thought he would bring cheer to the unemployed. I had thought he would empower people irrespective of their religion, caste or creed. Will increase the spending on health, agriculture and women.Alas, nowhere even close to achieve anything. JaiHind.</comment>

<comment>The very fact that you thought about so many things is an indication of 60 years of failure.</comment>

<comment>Complete lie - people like you are not endowed with the ability to think !</comment>

<comment>His energy, vigour and dedication to the capitalists is exemplary.... Feel proud to have him as our Non- resident PM!</comment>

<comment>Fortunately, he has given every Indian to be a capitalist with Startup India, Mudra Loans, easy Govt procedures.Only people who can't do anything whine like you day in day out. </comment>

<comment>I think you require some 182 or so days to become a Non-Resident, PM spent I think 50 days abroad out of 365 so that status doesn’t apply to him.</comment>

<comment>Ahh the Marxist leftist bull sh it.The leftist Marxist missionary agenda "lies, fear, hate, divide" influence, created under colonialism by the white priesthood. They want to end poverty, corruption, yet object to development all because pm is Hindu and not missionary educated  therefore the young macualeyite Indians simply cannot comprehend reality because from birth they been educated to only accept western rule, and oppress native Indian democracy that does not fit along the lines of western Christian democracy.India has no history, England has two roles, one to destroy Indian culture, and two to replace it with western materialism - Karl MarxIndia has been conquered once, but India must be conquered again, and that second conquest should be a conquest by education.” – Max Muller“When you control a man's thinking you do not have to worry about his actions. You do not have to tell him not to stand here or go yonder. He will find his 'proper place' and will stay in it. You do not need to send him to the back door. He will go without being told. In fact, if there is no back door, he will cut one for his special benefit. His education makes it necessary.”― Carter G. Woodson, The MIS-Education of the NegroPriya Joshi (Culture and Consumption: Fiction, the Reading Public, and the British Novel in Colonial India) writes:"Often, the implementation of a new education system leaves those who are colonized with a lack of identity and a limited sense of their past. The indigenous history and customs once practiced and observed slowly slip away. The colonized become hybrids of two vastly different cultural systems. Colonial education creates a blurring that makes it difficult to differentiate between the new, enforced ideas of the colonizers and the formerly accepted native practices."Ngugi Wa Thiong'o, (Kenya, Decolonising the Mind), displaying anger toward the isolationist feelings colonial education causes, asserted that the process"…annihilates a peoples belief in their names, in their languages, in their environment, in their heritage of struggle, in their unity, in their capacities and ultimately in themselves. It makes them see their past as one wasteland of non-achievement and it makes them want to distance themselves from that wasteland. It makes them want to identify with that which is furthest removed from themselves".We need to create Indians in color but white Christian in taste and opinion, we need to create a class of interpreters between us (west) and the millions we govern, we need to teach false history " - Thomas macualey, Christian Right winger and founder of Indian secular education“India has been conquered once, but India must be conquered again, and that second conquest should be a conquest by education.” – Max MullerAamir Khan educated at Saint Anne's High school, Christian missionary School.Shah Rukh Khan educated in St. Columba's School, Christian missionary schoolSaif Ali Khan educated in The Lawrence School, Christian missionary school.Salman khan educated in St. Stanislaus High School Christian missionary school.Akshay Kumar educated in Don Bosco High School Christian missionary school.Ranbir kapoor educated in Bombay Scottish school Christian missionary school.Deepika Padukone educated in Sophia high school, Christian missionary schoolRajdeep Sardesai educated in Saint Xavier college a Christian missionary schoolBarkha dutt educated in Saint Stephens college a Christian missionary schoolArundhati educated in Corpus Christi college a Christian missionary schoolArvind Kejriwal educated in Christian missionary school in Sonipat, worked with missionaries of charity and mother TheresaRavish kumar educated in Loyola high school a Christian missionary schoolShobhaa de educated in Saint Xavier college a Christian missionary schoolSagarika Ghose educated in Saint Stephens college a Christian missionary schoolShereen Bhan educated in saint Stephens college a Christian missionary schoolSweta Singh educated in Patna university, heavily influenced by Christian missionaryCyrus broacha educated in Saint Xavier's college, a Christian missionary schoolKaran Thapoor educated saint Anthony's college, a Christian origin collegeVikram Chandra educated Saint Stephens college, a Christian missionary schoolArnab goswami educated Saint Anthony's college, a Christian origin collegeShoma Chaudhury educated in Saint Helens covent, a Christian missionary schoolNarasimhan Ram educated in Loyola college, a Christian missionary school.Hundreds of journalist, editors, directors are educated in Christian missionary schools.Since the Indian media is founded by the priesthood education, they continue to ignore how economy is rising, investment rising, India fastest growing GDP in the world, they misdirect the public with false propaganda about tolerance, because the pm is not a missionary educated clone, therefore a danger to the 200 year agenda of the priesthood who have done to the same in Africa, America, Australia. A Hindu pagan, heathen, is someone the church has devoted 1500 years in wiping out. And now this Hindu pm wants to change the colonial education system laced with Christianity, like how many app tards and media who talk about secularism while attending a communal Christian religious schools.........ohh the irony. Now the left brigade are very very worried, they are about to be exposed before they have full control of the people.</comment>

<comment>Galaxy2016, you scumbag, when will you grow up?Can't you accept the fact that this man is working genuinely for the country unlike the guttersnipes of the past?</comment>

<comment>If you compare the expenses of Mr Modi's trip to that of former PM Manmohan, you'll find that Mr Modi's trip cost less or equal compared to Mr Singh's. Even though Mr Singh rarely travelled, his expenses shot up because he travelled with a coterie of journalists and many more. Mr Modi cut all that! Moreover, his foreign policy is way better than Mr Singh's too! Benefit of the trips. Personal relations with countries that matter is going to benefit India, its already showing results, case in point UAE!</comment>

<comment>You would be surprise to know that Modi's foreign visit expenditure in first year of office was actually 10-20% less than that of MMS. However the outcome was many times more :). If you are still disgruntled, get used to it or find a nearby drain !!</comment>
