Srinagar: Notwithstanding the BJP's optimism, PDP Chief Mehbooba Mufti on Sunday remained ambivalent on progress in talks on government formation, maintaining that she will be on board once she is convinced that she can "fulfill the dreams" of her father Mufti Mohammad Sayeed for Jammu and Kashmir."That only time can tell," was the cryptic response of the PDP president to reporters when they asked her if there was any forward movement in talks with the BJP for government formation in the state.Just days earlier, BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav had flown to Srinagar and held talks with the PDP chief after which he had said that "both parties are positive" on continuing with the arrangement.Mehbooba, who attended her first public function today after Sayeed's death on 7 January, said her visit to Delhi was only related to her duties as a Lok Sabha member.Mehbooba Mufti.

AFP"There are issues like JNU, which is unfortunate, Haryana (Jat agitation), we don't know what will happen in Parliament," she said.Earlier, addressing the party workers, Mehbooba said coming to power was not her goal."If we feel that we can fulfill the dreams of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, only then would it be worth it. If the situation continues as it is, then my inheritance (the people of the state) is enough for me," she said.The PDP president said her late father throughout his political career spanning over five decades struggled for the betterment of the people of Jammu and Kashmir."Only 12 years of his long political career, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was in power. However, he remained alive (in politics) due to the support of the people...He wanted to keep the state united and resolve the issues they faced," she said.Recalling the last few days of her father, Mehbooba said despite the advice of doctors, he continued to work and was concerned about the people of the state."Even in the hospital, he asked me if the money for flood victims has been released (by the Centre), whether the work on additional accommodation for Kashmiri Pandits at Sheikhpura had been started... when I told him that Prime Minister Modi had visited Pakistan," he just smiled."He did not sacrifice his life so that I can get the chair. He sacrificed his life for you," Mehbooba, choking on her words, said.On Sayeed's decision to ally with BJP, the PDP president said her father was ready for electoral loss but wanted to take the people of the state out of this uncertainty."He was of the belief that Modiji with such a huge mandate can take the state out of its troubles if he is able to convince him about the need for India-Pakistan friendship and resolution of outstanding issues," she said.Mehbooba said her father wanted Jammu and Kashmir to become a bridge between India and Pakistan.PTI
