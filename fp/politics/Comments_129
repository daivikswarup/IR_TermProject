<comment>Why Rahul and Soni are silent on massive corruption prevailing in Kerala? Rahul is criticizing Modi on corruption but what he is doing to curb massive corruption in Congress ruled states like Karnataka, Kerala, Uttarkhand etc where life of people has become miserable. If Rahul has any guts, he should ensure ZERO TOLERANCE OF CORRUPTION in Congress ruled states. Only then people can think to vote to Congress. Otherwise CONGRESS MUKT BHARAT is must to end ITALIAN CORRUPT rule in this country. Nothing can be achieved if Rahul will fail to act in decisive way as elaborated above. Chandi must be dismissed from CM post for Solar scam.</comment>
