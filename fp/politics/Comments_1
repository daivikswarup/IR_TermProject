<comment>Government Brahmins[supporters of reservation policy] are cannibals of merit. Indian state tutors them to NOT see that reservation policy caste certificate holders who murder merit practice cannibalistic culture. The problem is no Nation practicing cannibalism human sacrifice can be a democracy! Bureaucratic Indian state, still follows the laws of British Bureaucracy.Lack of free speech [sedition laws]and reservation policy was promoted and encouraged by British Bureaucracy which saw to it that Indian share of GDP fell from 28% after East India Company's rule to 3%. Brahmins are modern dalits who are sold by the Indian bureaucracy - they even have a plan to bring in reservation in private sector.What is the secret that BJP/Congress policy are always similar. That is because after having both parties call each other anti-national, the moot question remains WHO IS THE NATION? Why are parties subservient to it? NATION  is the Indian bureaucracy, which maintains its power by INTELLIGENT rigging[read indiaevm . org elections by Electronic Voting Machines]. It is the same bureaucracy which makes ease of doing business and nations progress very very low. Unfortunately Modi trusts in the same bureaucracy</comment>

<comment>Haha how has the reservation in itself failed ? Slowly everyone is asking for one. This system was not supposed to work. If powerful and rich communities like Jats and Patels ( who own most of the big business houses in Gujarat) get the reservations too then it is like whites asking for reservation in USAThis system was bound to fail. First Gujjars in Rajasthan, then Jats in Haryana and now Patels in Gujarat. Next what ? Is someone in Maharashtra not asking now ? I am sure next will be a community in Maharashtra Punjab UP etc. This system was bound to fail from day 1I am just laughing because Jats have set such a poor example burn few places be violent kill people and get the quota. Anyone can now do that - if a mob has more than 5000 people also how will police overpower them ? Also they can't shoot 5000 people </comment>

<comment>Best way to make reservation irrelevant - Give reservation to each and every community, caste and religion.</comment>

<comment>Khattar wants to give reservations to Jats by protecting OBC reservations at the expense of general  merit. BJP is anti-National.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------What if the state is captured by a mob? India is a Ocholocracy [mob rule] as Individual rights( like merit) is murdered, by definition, as by reservation policy and Individual right of property rights are murdered by Socialism. Will you call Jats who destroyed an entire state as anti-National? Will you call kapus anti-National as they burnt a train. Pro-Reservation agitation is action as compared to just hot air of sloganeering [logically punishment should also be hot air]. VP Singh has made constitution anti-national and Modi I suspect will bring private sector reservations to become another VP Singh----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------No Support to Khalid. Kanhaiya Kumar is different as he is not a member of communist Democratic Students Union which is for the murder of Individual rights and is for collectivism. Communists support reservation policy, which is murder of Individual right of merit and also are for demolishing property rights another important Individual right.Kanhaiya Kumar as PM!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------However Let us examine Sedition laws------------------------------------1)Law of Vikamaditya: A prostitute hears a Brahmin who says to his friend that she had appeared in the Brahmins man's dreams and she was wonderful. The Prostitute drags the Brahmin to Vikramaditya for her fees. Vikramaditya hangs a bag of Gold and asks the prostitute to get her fees from the MIRROR. If service is virtual reward is also virtual. In sedition laws if the 'crime' is talking then the punishment should also be 'talking'2)USA Laws protect a person who burns the National Flag as the crime is CONSIDERED virtual and is not action. State acts when the 'crime' is in action3)In Kedar Nath Singh’s Case, 5 judges of the Supreme Court – a Constitution bench – made it clear that allegedly seditious speech and expression may be punished only if the speech is an ‘incitement’ to ‘violence’, or ‘public disorder’. Subsequent cases have further clarified the meaning of this phrase. In Indra Das v. State of Assam and Arup Bhuyan v. State of Assam, the Supreme Court unambiguously stated that only speech that amounts to “incitement to imminent lawless action” can be criminalised.There is a flaw in the LOGIC  of supreme court. How can an INDIVIDUAL be punished for the actions of the mob - particularly when India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] as the reservation policy agitation of Kapus and Jats showed. IS IT THE FAULT OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAT INDIA HAS BECOME EXPLOSIVE? HOW SHOULD THE INDIVIDUAL KNOW IN ADVANCE if a situation will explode? The faulty logic of mixed economy[read article on mixed economy down below] and acts of VP Singh, which made the constitution anti-National. Indira Gandhi has made the constitution anti-national by inserting socialism[as by definition legal robbery, as distinct from charity and implies forceful SNATCHING]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arun SHourie put the problem in two words Present BJP govt is congress+cow. He implied Modi has been a failure. Failed persons in politics can be dangerous. I strongly suspect that he will try to bring in private sector reservations and try to become another VP SIngh, who made the constitution anti-national along with Indira Gandhi when she inserted legal robbery of socialism into constitution.--------------------------------------------------------------------The solution is to apply merit to PM on the basis of  MERIT. I had recommended, earlier:Now BJP/RSS should be creative, PROACTIVE, and bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics. USA experience shows that goons kill each other in presence of free gun laws. None will kill with a legal weapon.2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=========================================================Mixed economy is a fascist economy. Bureaucracy/mafia politician becomes the supreme arbiter. Consider reservation policy: The only work of a government is protection of Individual rights - Jefferson, 2nd president of USA.. President of India as head of state has to commit suicide as merit, an Individual right, is murdered by reservation policy. The state is duty bound to protect Individual from mobs. Such arguments are not answered but ignored -- what the state does is right. Nazism was stateism like socialism. Those who could obtain power could justify state-sponsored murder and plunder by pointing out that since morals don't really exist and are merely a product of one's class or upbringing, there is no moral argument against the state version of murder and plunder.Socialism introduced into constitution during emergency is legal robbery. Way forward is capitalism[another name of freedom]Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim’s gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of money taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials and mafia politicians.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, but that it cannot be used honestly.Why does not the state allot a seat strictly on merit and snatch it away OPENLY?Gandhian Socialism of BJP is Gandhiism [selling of ones supporters to gain support of Jinnah and Muslims and Socialism is legal robbery]</comment>

<comment>The point is in next 10 years reservation system will fail ! Simple as people have resorted to violence to get it passed. Today it's Jats tomorrow it is patels next year someone else ... Basically this is going to spread now and the system is failingIt is like now even rich want reservations something similar to whites asking for the same in USA when blacks are the ones getting oppressed </comment>

<comment>I know. But I want it to fail in a my designed manner - so that there is free capitalist economy with sustained free growth, and with free gun laws as in USA[safe as capitalism ensures larger and larger cake] and gold standard in currency.It should not fail in a manner that it leads to chaotic civil war as in SOCIALIST Sri lanka where the 30 year civil war started with reservation policy directed against Tamils. Sample of which we saw in Kapu and Jat reservation stir.</comment>
