<comment>This is an informal survey....  I am not talking sedition plz ;)how many here would be okay with a re-partition of india if it meant seperating with muslims COMPLETELY once and for all?I am all for it</comment>

<comment>I am not...i say kick out all moslems n send over to Europe... let the christians fight them there....</comment>

<comment>good idea... or why not provide  muslims with free tickets to Islamic state ... it will aslo be good for enhancing sickular credentialsI will gladly pay a surcharge on tax for this</comment>

<comment>It seems the Muslims have lost all stomach for a fight.... on national international forums I see insult after insult on them(I contribute  too) but the reply is only from global pseudo-secular-liberals with their monochromatic ideas.It ain't fun anymore</comment>

<comment>Message to Muslims of India Your time is over. You will now exist only as third-grade humans in the world flogged by everyone.  You and your Sultans who ruled over India have failed in accomplishing Ghazwa-e-Hind and thereby failed your prophet. Now you have to pay for this sin. Our friend Donald in US made Islam a bad-word overnight. Our zionist allies help the Islamic state to bring fire on you. Soon you will loose all moral fortitude and turn your back on Allah and his pedophile messenger because you are cowards. Like in Syria where instead of fighting for their country they are running away to infidel europe to live on the streets and beg. Your ancestors were coward hindus who joined the barbarian invaders and thier blood continues to flow in your veins.Reading this will cause you lot of burn because it is so true isn't it?</comment>

<comment>I invite muslims to reply... I will get only secular trash though</comment>

<comment>Isn't a mosque just a gathering place? So that Muslims can face in the direction of Mecca and offer their namaz. I may be wrong, but from all I have seen over the years, that is the sense I get. So if a brand new mosque with polished tiles and world class amenities is built in some other place, why should there be a problem.Most current generation Muslims in Aodhya have not offered namaz at Babri. So what difference does this make to them.Now someone will turn up and say why can't Hindus have a temple somewhere else. To that I have nothing else to say other than, someone has to back down and to me Muslims backing down seems easier to do at this time.</comment>

<comment>dear sickular... don't consider yourself to represent Indians or Hindus. Ram hamare man mein hai isiliye unke liye mandir chahiye. keep your leftist shit inside you, don't make us smell it</comment>

<comment>He must be a 'cool' namazi secular who finds it cool to visit a mosque and do islamic shit and when it comes to worshipping in a temple he/she reacts like "Oh that crappy pooja path".. Its not mah cup of tea!!</comment>

<comment>you are a fool apolitical. Stand up if you are a hindu. Our religious places are hijacked by other religions mainly Muslims. Its not about vitriolic remarks against a particular community but its all about get our esteem back. So dont give these foolish statements.

<comment>Drappko noka!! True.. Why is our hindu community a fool? I dont get that.. In Ch*tiyon ko koi samjhae ki every religion in the world have their religious places intact. Vatican for Christians, Jerusalem for Jews, amritsar for Sikhs, mecca for Muslims.. Then when can't we rever our Gods and their birthplaces which are hijacked by muzzies?</comment>

<comment>The problem with Hindus is that they have not read Quran or Hadith and don't know a thing about Islam from  religious perspective. They look at it from hinduism/Indian perspective or a hindu tinted glass. They presume that just like any other religion of the world, Islam is also a spiritual religion. And that there are some minority of Muslims who are hijacking the religion. That can't be farther from the truth. Hindus need to understand that Islam is different. It is a complete political ideology just like communism, fascism that affects social, cultural and political life of an individual that is cloaked in religion. That makes it extremely dangerous as this claok of religion shields it from scrutiny and criticizms. Hindus or Indians need to open up their eyes and get upto speed with this fact. Indians need to understand the strategic nature of this threat that it is not just Islam but the Indian civilization s we know it that is under threat.</comment>

<comment>Rightly mentioned!! Hindus have to get up before its too late. Indians must come forward irrespective of their castes, religion etc. towards this deadly religion. But unfortunately they are so busy in selfish things that they cant even spare some time towards nation building</comment>

<comment>We are not spreading poison, we are demanding the land which belongs to ram lala. Go and learn some hindu scripture and stop giving political statements.</comment>

<comment>SWAMY JI aap lage raho...................jai shree Ram</comment>

<comment>Tumahare jaise Ghaitiya logo ka banaya hua Mandir, Nahi chahiye Ram ko, Agar Ram , Ram hai tho.What were the Hindus doing when Muslims destroyed their temples as they claim, The Hindus were busy fight among each other, lower caste fellow do not drink water from upper caste reservoirs, Lower caste Fellows do not enter Temples. Upper Caste Fellows take Fresh water path if he sees a Lower caste fellow.Lord Rama will be more happy if you build  Proper Toilets for poor Indians, He will appreciate more , if he is Lord Rama.A temple built by people like you Swamy, you dirty swamy or rather Hindus of this Nation, is an Insult to Lord Rama, Your daily prayers are insult to Lord Rama.Go swamy , Have a look at Ganga River, Go complete that work before you start anything else</comment>

<comment>Hindus were doing the same thing what muslims were in 1992. Yea Hindus weren't united..same like a billion Muslims in middle East who fight for their caste (Sunni, Shia and Alawi )and in the process have no guts to touch Mighty Israel -with few million Jewish population</comment>

<comment>Such documents cannot be followed in the modern times with democratic institutions gaining power.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. But wherever Islam has gained power, it has been followed by suppression/dissolution of any democratic process. Why? Quran dictates complete surrender to Allah and His laws and to no one else. These laws are enunciated in Quran and Hadith- the so called Sharia Law. Democracy is considered a man-made system of law which is against Islam. Therefore, a true believer will always be against democracy. Just see what happened to Arab spring in Egypt, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere in Middle East.</comment>

<comment>You are absolutely correct.</comment>

<comment>Origins of terrorism......</comment>

<comment>Who the hell is interested in what is written in the scriptures of any religion. Learn to live peacefully with your countrymen.</comment>

<comment>Do you remember the ethnic cleansing of Pandits from Kashmir? Read what Muslims did toChristian majority Lebanon and how they did it in 1970s. It was all a playbook out of Quran and Hadith.This is what Mohammed(the ultimate human ideal to be followed by all Muslims) did to Jewsish and Christian tribes. Two soldiers, Lance Naik Hemraj and Lance Naik Sudhakar Singh, were killed and their bodies were apparently found mutilated, with one decapitated in 2013. Why behead a soldier when killing is good enough? Where is the motivation for these actions generating from? It is all coming out of Quran and Hadhiths. It's all in there. Unless you know the enemy how will you defeat it? Burying your head in sand and hoping that threat will go away is suicidal. Wake up before it is too late.</comment>

<comment>Brilliant!. I just love coming to these news website comment sections at the end of a day's hard work to find everyone fighting. It is so refreshing. Hindus calling muslims as porkis, Pakistanis, terrorists. Muslims calling hindus as kafirs, modi-ass-lickers and <insert name="" of="" god=""> knows what not.Is it really that hard for all of us to love each other and live in peace? When a child is born, they do not know about religions, caste, race, creed, sex, sexuality, even nationality (yeah I said it). So they do not have any bias towards anyone and are just happy to be. Can't we adults learn anything from their innocence.Before pouncing on me for bringing in the word nationality in my previous sentence, I want to make it very clear that I am a very patriotic person and have the utmost respect for our soldiers who die everyday so that we can have a sound sleep. But that doesn't mean that my patriotism converts into hate for other nations. Ask yourself one thing, if a Pakistani man was lying injured on road in front of you bleeding to death and pleading for help, will you deny him help? Really? I believe that humanity is greater than any man made boundary, be it of religions or nationality or any other thing. All religions preach in some form that "serve man, serve god". So much hatred, so much pain and anger makes us lose faith in humanity one person at a time. Do you think soldiers take pleasure in wars? Do you think they like the idea of ensuing tension between our country and our neighbors? The greatest form of patriotism which all of us can show is to try spread peace so that they don't have to fight and die.Please stop fighting.</comment>

<comment>Well said.... Exactly my thoughts... It wud be so wonderful if everyone came up with these thoughts... </comment>

<comment>You infidel/unbeliever - this is what will be done to you. Don't you understand? There will be no patriotism for you to show once you are dead, Mr.! Mind you, these are just few of the samples.Quran (48:29) - "Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those with him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves"Quran (5:33) - "The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides..."Quran (8:12) - "Remember thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): "I am with you: give firmness to the Believers: I will instill terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their fingertips off them."</comment>

<comment>Mohammad was a paediophile, by accounts in your own scriptures. Do not preach Islam over here. If you have any logical arguments, I am listening.</comment>

<comment>I am not preaching. I am simply stating what is in Quran. Don't malign the messenger(pun intended!).</comment>

<comment>He is exposing violence in Islam, not preaching Islam. Read before crucifying a fellow hindu.</comment>

<comment>Swamy has approached Supreme Court. You are saying Supreme Court is political?Kahan kahan se aa jaate hain....</comment>

<comment>Rupee has hit 68.91, its all time low in off-shore trading. Here we are talking about Ram temple.</comment>

<comment>You are talking nonsense.</comment>

<comment>So you mean to say building a RAm temple will further worsen the currency and economy of india? Building a ram temple is a matter of self esteem for we hindus who worship our gods  and not you 'cool' namazi seculars of india. So better dont digress from the issues and make a fool out of yourself.</comment>

<comment>Nice one... 👍👍</comment>

<comment>As late as in 2008 floods, River Kosi changed its course in Bihar. The authority on "Ancient Indian History", Vincent Smith has said that rivers in India have been changing their courses from time to time.Hence, it would not be that easy to pin point the location of any pre-historic place!So pinpointing present day Ayodhya with "Treta Yuga" Ayodhya which was some million human years ago appears to be difficult indeed! Further, when so many temples in Ayodhya claim to be the Birth place of Lord Rama,today, how could  this became a disputed citeonly in the 20th century of Christian era?The matter is "subjudice' in the Supreme Court since May,2011! How then, Swamy could fore-tell it will declare the verdict by year end?</comment>

<comment>Okey swamy if this land belong to Ram than let Ram build temple himself. Who are you to represent Ram in court? Let the living diety fight the court case, who are you to represent him? Does Lord Ram appointed you power of attorney? Why you want to help muslim build mosque? Because your daughter married a muslim.</comment>

<comment>Wonderful mann... U really shut the mouths of these stupid people.... </comment>

<comment>Why not have a world class hospital there?We have enough of temples.There can be a small prayer room for Muslims and similar for the Ram idol in the hospital premises.Hospital will solve many problems of the populace there.Get jobs.Attract health tourism as well.No side feels hurt or defeated and the issue is once and for all resolved. We can't afford to go on fighting and helping our modern day Jaichands and the friendly neighbourhood country.DR Swamy should mow focus more on more important issues.The Govt.needs all experienced old timers to guide it.</comment>

<comment>Awww.... so cute dr. Viraj pradhan... Why not make viraj a teacher in Madarsa instead of a doctor?? I am not sure if you are a Hindu because you would have never said that. RAm Janambhoomi is a matter of pride and self esteem for we hinuds. You would be a namazi secular shit. But one second, wait for the day the topis come to behead you and say "Why not make Viraj pradhan as Virajuddin Mohammad!" or either get killed.</comment>

<comment>Dear Mr.Bansal .Thanks for replying to me.I am a proud Hindu and won't have to fear being beheaded,We have the Shiv Sena here to protect us.We have had  a saint here in Maharashtra ,Sant Ramdas( who was Chhatrapati Shivaji's Guru) who had ,after much spiritual progress,said--Raam roopi antaratma.One's own soul"s innermost core is that Raam.When He is within me why have any outside dependence?Think about the issues being faced by the Govt. and you will understand.</comment>

<comment>we have plenty of land in india where we can build hospotal, but there is only one birth place for LORD RAMA. What is wrong in building the temple there?</comment>

<comment>God is suppose to be everywhere so you can have temple anywhere, Ram would be happy if you can build a place to really heal wounds instead of a place where old wounds will be reopened</comment>

<comment>Good so we build it in the place where it existed earlier. Lets do this together..</comment>

<comment>How come a son(ram) of a king taken birth on a open land and not in a palace?</comment>

<comment>My post say it all.Thanks for replying,Indian.</comment>

<comment>I wish the people of India irrespective of their religions would strive together for the 'Ram Rajya' Rather than 'Ram Mandir'...Ram would never ask anyone to ring bell and light a lamp in front of a stone statue. He would just want people to be happy and prosperous in his land.Building the temple (Or Mosque) would serve no real purpose other than stroking egos of certain people.</comment>

<comment>some extremists had stopped the construction of ram temple else it would have been made 20 years back, extremist acting as a leader of communities must stop, people have paid big prices due to extremist leaders from either side, people need to earn their daily bread and rest all can wait, work is worship, god is in ones heart, keep it clean and honest! but all said and done, historic evidence proved that it was a mandir, so it has to be constructed, and law of land, our constitution should support it!</comment>

<comment>Discoveries at the site II: the Hari-Vishnu inscriptionThe demolition on December 6, 1992 changed the picture dramatically,providing further support to the traditional accounts — both Hindu and Muslim.Some of the kar-sevaks, no doubt influenced by all the publicity about historyand archaeology, went on to pick up more than two hundred pieces of stone slabswith writing upon them. These proved to belong to extremely importantinscriptions, more than a thousand years old. In effect, the kar-sevakshad done what archaeologists should have done years ago; they had unearthedimportant inscriptions — in howsoever a crude form — something that shouldhave been done years ago by professional historians and archaeologists. Theinscriptions, even the few that have been read so far, shed a great deal oflight on the history of not only Ayodhya and its environs, but all of NorthIndia in the early Medieval, and even the late ancient period.In any other society, these inscriptions and other archaeologicalartifacts would not only be greeted with glee — as Biblical scholars did theDead Sea Scrolls — but there would also be a mad scramble among researchers tosee what new discoveries they could make. But the Secularists' reaction was theexact opposite of this: they wanted the whole thing suppressed. They claimed,without examination, that all the two-hundred and fifty odd pieces ofepigraphical records were forgeries planted during the demolition, and demandeda police investigation. This is a point worth noting: they wanted not an investigation ofartifacts by scholars, but a policeinvestigation.To return to the inscriptional finds, it will be years before scholarscan come up with a complete picture, but they have already yielded much valuableinformation. Here is what S.P. Gupta found upon examining the two-hundred andfifty or so stone pieces with writing upon them:      Not all were ancient, since scores of them, generally rectangular marble tiles, borethe dedicatory inscriptions in the Devanagari script of the 20th century.However, at least three dozens of them were certainly ancient, belonging to theperiod bracketed between 10th and 12th centuries AD. (In TheAyodhya Reference: pp 117-18)The most important of these deciphered so far is the Hari-Vishnuinscription that clinches the whole issue of the temple. It is written in 12thcentury AD Devanagari script and belongs therefore to the period before theonslaught of the Ghorids (1192 AD and later). Gupta tells us:This inscription, running in as many as 20 lines, is found engraved on a 5ft. long, 2 ft. broad and 2.5 inches thick slab of buff sandstone, apparently avery heavy tablet ... Three-fourths of the tablet is found obliteratedanciently. The last line is also not complete since it was anciently subjectedto chipping off. A portion of the central part is found battered, maybe someonetried to deface it anciently. The patination [tarnishing including wearout] is,however, uniform all over the surface, even in areas where once there wereinscriptions. (op. cit. pp 118-19). Gupta is an archaeologist and not an epigraphist trained to read ancientinscriptions. It was examined by Ajay Mitra Shastri, Chairman of theEpigraphical Society of India. Shastri gave the following summary. What theinscription tells us is of monumental significance to the history of MedievalIndia.      The inscription is composed in high-flown Sanskrit verse, except for a very smallportion in prose, and is engraved in chaste and classical Nagari script of theeleventh-twelfth century AD. It has yet to be fully deciphered, but the portionswhich have been fully deciphered and read areof great historical significance and value ... [It has since been fully deciphered.] It was evidently put up onthe wall of the temple, the construction of which is recorded in the textinscribed on it. Line 15 of this inscription, for example, clearly tells us thata beautiful temple of Vishnu-Hari, built with heaps of stones ... , andbeautified with a golden spire ... unparalleled by any other temple built byearlier kings ... This wonderful temple ... was built in the temple-city ofAyodhya situated in Saketamandala. ... Line 19 describes god Vishnu asdestroying king Bali ... and the ten headed personage (Dashanana, i.e., Ravana). (op. cit. 119; emphasis mine. Original Sanskrit quotes given by Shastri are left out.)Need we say more — a temple for Hari-Vishnu who killed the ten-headedRavana, in the temple city of Ayodhya? So Ayodhya was known as a temple cityeven then; Saketa was the ancient name of the district. The inscription confirmswhat archaeologists Lal and Gupta had earlier found about the existence of atemple complex. And yet the Secularists and their allies have been telling theworld that there was no temple!</comment>

<comment>Abhinav Garg, TNN, Oct 2, 2010NEW DELHI: “In our view, the conclusion drawn by the ASI in the project accomplished within an extra-ordinary brief period and with such an excellence precision and perfection deserve commendation and appreciation instead of condemnation.” — Justice Sudhir Agarwal.Though criticized by a section of historians, the Archaeological Survey of India’s 2003 excavation report has been critical in allowing the Allahabad high court in reaching a verdict that years of negotiations and entrenched politiking had not yielded.The ASI view that evidence pointed to the existence of a temple, forms the key material evidence relied upon by the court. Perhaps keeping in mind the criticism of ASI’s findings, Justice Sudhir Agarwal and Justice D V Sharma in their comments have countered allegations of the report being influenced by powers that be.They emphasized that the court controlled excavation was transparent. The charge that the finding of a huge structure preexisting the Babri Masjid, was “managed” has been addressed in detail. It had been alleged that the report was “biased and imagined” and failed to faithfully reproduce the actual findings.But the judges have decisively recalled the facts of the case. While Justice Agarwal pointed out how representatives and lawyers of each party in the suit were permitted to shadow ASI officials during the actual excavations, Justice Sharma highlighted how “even Muslim members have also signed the report of ASI.”“The court has taken full care and issued specific directions to maintain transparency. Two judicial officers remained posted there. The excavation was conducted in the presence of the parties, lawyers and their nominees. Nobody can raise a finger about the propriety of the report on the ground of bias,” Justice Sharma observed, rejecting pleas that the report be discarded.The court said that the ASI report contains all the details including details of stratigraphy, artifacts, periodisation as well as details of structures and walls. The pillar bases mentioned in the report establishes beyond all doubt the existence of a huge structure.In addition to above, existence of circular shrine, stone slabs in walls with Hindu motifs and more particularly sign of Makar Pranal in wall No. 5 (wall of disputed structure), divine couple and other temple materials, etc. conclusively proves the existence of a hindu religious structure, the judges have argued.Another grievance related to ASI allegedly ignoring key evidence thrown up in the form of bones of animals found from the sites. This, it was argued, disproved that the structure below was a Hindu one since animals couldn’t have been killed there. But the judges countered by relying on a host of ancient literary Hindu texts sanctioning animal sacrifice.“It is a well known fact that in certain Hindu temples animal sacrifices are made and flesh is eaten as Prasad while bones are deposited below the floor at the site itself,” Justice Agarwal noted, upholding the ASI findings that a Nagara style northern Indian temple existed prior to the disputed structure. HC was also surprised to note the “zeal” in some of the archaeologists and historians appearing as witnesses on behalf of the Sunni Waqf Board who made statements much beyond reliefs demanded by the Waqf.</comment>

<comment>I don't have any skin in this fight personally. I haven't read the court's verdict, except for your above comments. However, as a Bengali, my experience is animal sacrifice is prevalent at Shiva Temples (after Maha Shivaratri) and Kali Temples.I have never heard of animal sacrifice at Ram Mandirs.In fact Shri Ram is the reigning deity in the hearts of the people, largely in UP, Bihar, MP, Maharashtra, Gujarat (Shri Krishna). All of these places have a traditionally  largely vegetarian Hindu population. I am aware McD and KFC have changed eating preferences, but I refer to traditional mores.The places inhabited by largely fish / meat eating Hindus, Kerala, West Bengal, Konkan coast, hardly have Shri Ramchandra as their presiding deity.I find it singular, that the temple existing at the exact birth place of Lord Shri Rama is in fact that of another deity.</comment>

<comment>++++Mr SWAMY,  HINDU SCRIPTURES MAY SAY ANY THING ABOUT THE OWNERSHIP OF LAND.  ALL THOSE ARE APPLICABLE ONLY TO SETTLE THE ISSUES WITHIN THE HINDU COMMUNITY.  A MUSLIM HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.  SIMILARLY MUSLIM SCRIPTURE OR QURAN MAY SAY ANYTHING.  THAT IS TO BE APPLIED ONLY WITHIN THE MUSLIM, A HINDU HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.  WHEN A DISPUTE IS BETWEEN INTER RELIGIONS,  A COMMON UNIVERSAL LAW HAS TO BE APPLIED AND THAT IS THE JUSTICE.  THE SPIRIT OF LAW IS TO DO THE GREATER GOOD TO THE SOCIETY WITHOUT HARMING ANY SINGLE SOUL AND NOT TO SATISFY YOUR EGOISTIC DEMANDS WITH  ULTERIOR MOTIVE OF DIVIDING THE SOCIETY.THE BEST THING TO PRESERVE PEACE AND HARMONY IS TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO AS IT WAS AT THE TIME OF INDEPENDENCE.   IN THE PROCESS OF INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT PEOPLE BELONGING TO EVERY RELIGION CONTRIBUTED.  THEY ALL DID SO WITH THE HOPE THAT PEACE AND JUSTICE WILL BE MAINTAINED IN A BETTER WAY AFTER THE INDEPENDENCE.  SO WHY DO YOU WANT TO RUIN THE GOOD HOPES OF THOSE GREAT MEN.  PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEART AND ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION, “  WOULD MAHATMA GANDHI AGREE TO YOUR ARGUMENT OF  JUSTIFYING THE FORCEFUL DESTRUCTION OF MASJID AND CONSTRUCTION A TEMPLE ON THE SAME LOCATION ? “ YOUR BJP/RSS AGENDA IS TO DIVIDE THE SOCIETY IN THE NAME OF RELIGIONS, CREATE BITTER MUTUAL ANIMOSITY AMONG THEM AND STAND ON THE SIDE OF MAJORITY COMMUNITY IN THAT TROUBLED WATER SUCH  THAT YOUR VICTORY IS ENSURED IN SPITE OF YOUR CORRUPT PRACTICES.

<comment>Mr. Subramanium Swamy is a learned person and what he says carries great weight. In-fact not only that Ayodhya temple cannot be moved anywhere but there are numerous cases in which mosques have been build in places of Temples during Mughals period. Historians must research closely and identify all such mosques and churches which have to be demolished and restored to temples. The historian Oak has conclusively proved that Taj Mahal is a Hindu monument and that has to be restored. Mr. Oak can be approached and ask to work on this plan. Qutub Minar, Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Fatehpur Sikhri, Char Minar etc should be the starting point.</comment>

<comment>‘There were enough artefacts to prove site a sacred place’CHENNAI: Artefacts found by archaeological excavations at the disputed site in Ayodhya proved that it had been a sacred place and not merely a human habitation, according to archaeologist R Nagaswamy. He had given expert advice to the Allahabad high court’s Lucknow bench that heard the title suits in the Ayodhya case. The oldest structure for which evidence was dug up belonged to the 3rd century BC, said Nagaswamy, former director of archaeology in Tamil Nadu.“The excavations done by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) brought to light several carved stones that indicated the presence of a sacred place. Some of the material unearthed included pillars with engravings on them, an outlet for water in the form of a crocodile mouth,” he said.While the ASI carried out excavations on the HC’s orders in 2003, Nagaswamy presented a report to the court, explaining in detail the artefacts unearthed by the ASI. “The artefacts proved that they belonged to a sacred place and not just any human habitation. The existence of a shrine was one of the crucial pieces of evidence presented to the judges,” Nagaswamy said.Showing an array of photographs of various artefacts, the expert said the excavations were carried out to a depth of 50 to 60 feet below the surface. “The ASI found several layers of artefacts belonging to different periods and there was evidence of a massive stone religious structure belonging to the 10th century AD,” Nagaswamy said.The ASI carried out two types of excavation. The first was an electro-magnetic survey without any digging, and later, it carried out site excavation in the presence of the parties to the case. “The time given by the court to the ASI was only three months, and within that time, it came out with some important findings,” he said. “The judges asked me to explain as to how I arrived at the conclusions on various artefacts and I gave them all the details and explained my conclusions to them,” he said.Among the pieces of structural evidence that the ASI found were an ‘amalaka’, a stone disk-like piece normally found in N Indian shrines, and some terracotta figures showing human busts adorned with jewellery.</comment>

<comment>Radar searchIn the January 2003, Canadian geophysicist Claude Robillard performed a search with a ground-penetrating radar. The survey concluded the following:“There is some structure under the mosque. The structures were ranging from 0.5 to 5.5 meters in depth that could be associated with ancient and contemporaneous structures such as pillars, foundation walls, slab flooring, extending over a large portion of the site”.Claude Robillard, the chief geophysicist stated the following:“There are some anomalies found underneath the site relating to some archaeological features. You might associate them (the anomalies) with pillars, or floors, or concrete floors, wall foundation or something. These anomalies could be associated with archaeological features but until we dig, I can’t say for sure what the construction is under the mosque.”The final ASI report of August 25, 2003 stated that there was evidence of a large Hindu temple having pre‐existed the Babri mosque. Midway into the excavations the courts ordered the removal of the head of the ASI excavations for not following the excavation norms.Update 2nd Oct 2010After the Ayodhya Verdict, some of the “Eminent historians” who are on the payroll of the left brigade have started questioning the ASI report. This is an old trick which has been played so so so many times by the Leftists that it has lost its effect. The ASI report was out in 2003 and was in public domain for 7 years and to try to create a circle of doubt over the report which is conclusive evidence is a part of their game.The following newspaper reports on 2nd Oct are worth reading. Note that on 1st Oct, Economic Times which is from the same family of Times of India had printed an article raising doubts on ASI report…It seems good sense has now dawned upon them..and hopefully the good sense will prevail.</comment>

<comment>The Archaeological Survey of India ReportThe Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) excavated the mosque site at the direction of the Allahabad Bench of the Uttar Pradesh high court in 2003. The archaeologists reported evidence of a large 10th century structure similar to a Hindu temple having pre-existed the Babri Masjid. A team of 131 labourers including 29 Muslims – who were later on included on the objections of the Muslim side- was engaged in the excavations. In June 11, 2003 the ASI issued an interim report that only listed the findings of the period between May 22 and June 6, 2003. In August 2003 the ASI handed a 574-page report to the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court.The ASI, who examined the site, issued a report of the findings of the period between May 22 and June 6, 2003. This report stated:“Among the structures listed in the report are several brick walls ‘in east-west orientation’, several ‘in north-south orientation’, ‘decorated coloured floor’, several ‘pillar bases’, and a ‘1.64-metre high decorated black stone pillar (broken) with vaksha figurines on four corners’ as well as “Arabic inscription of holy verses on stone” Earlier reports by the ASI, based on earlier findings, also mention among other things a staircase and two black basalt columns ‘bearing fine decorative carvings with two crosslegged figures in bas-relief on a bloomed lotus with a peacock whose feathers are raised upwards’.The excavations give ample traces that there was a mammoth pre-existing structure beneath the three-domed Babri structure. Ancient perimeters from East to West and North to South have been found beneath the Babri fabrication. The bricks used in these perimeters predate the time of Babur. Beautiful stone pieces bearing carved Hindu ornamentations like lotus, Kaustubh jewel, alligator facade, etc., have been used in these walls. These decorated architectural pieces have been anchored with precision at varied places in the walls. A tiny portion of a stone slab is sticking out at a place below 20 feet in one of the pits. The rest of the slab lies covered in the wall. The projecting portion bears a five-letter Dev Nagari inscription that turns out to be a Hindu name. The items found below 20 feet should be at least 1,500 years old. According to archaeologists about a foot of loam layer gathers on topsoil every hundred years. Primary clay was not found even up to a depth of 30 feet. It provides the clue to the existence of some structure or the other at that place during the last 2,500 years.More than 30 pillar bases have been found at equal spans. The pillar-bases are in two rows and the rows are parallel. The pillar-base rows are in North-South direction. A wall is superimposed upon another wall. At least three layers of the floor are visible. An octagonal holy fireplace (Yagna Kund) has been found. These facts prove the enormity of the pre-existing structure. Surkhii has been used as a construction material in our country since over 2000 years and in the constructions at the Janma Bhumi Surkhii has been extensively used. Molded bricks of round and other shapes and sizes were neither in vogue during the middle ages nor are in use today. It was in vogue only 2,000 years ago. Many ornate pieces of touchstone (Kasauti stone) pillars have been found in the excavation. Terracotta idols of divine fugurines, serpent, elephant, horse-rider, saints, etc., have been found. Even to this day terracotta idols are used in worship during Diwali celebrations and then put by temple sanctums for invoking divine blessings. The Guptaand the Kushan period bricks have been found. Brick walls of the Gahadwal period (12th Century CE) have been found in excavations.Nothing has been found to prove the existence of residential habitation there. The excavation gives out the picture of a vast compound housing a sole distinguished and greatly celebrated structure used for divine purposes and not that of a colony or Mohalla consisting of small houses. That was an uncommon and highly celebrated place and not a place of habitation for the common people. Hindu pilgrims have always been visiting that place for thousands of years. Even today there are temples around that place and the items found in the excavations point to the existence of a holy structure of North Indian architectural style at that place.</comment>

<comment>2007 Samjhauta Express bombingTwin blasts shook two coaches of the Samjhauta Express around midnight on 18 February 2007. Sixty-eight people were killed in the ensuing fire and dozens were injured. It has been allegedly linked to Abhinav Bharat, a Hindu fundamentalist group. In November 2008, it was reported that the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) suspected the attacks were linked to Prasad Shrikant Purohit, an Indian army officer and member of Abhinav Bharat. Purohit himself claimed that he had "infiltrated" the Abhinav Bharat. During an army's Court of Inquiry, 59 witnesses stated to the court, along with Officers who testified, that Purohit was doing his job of gathering intelligence inputs by infiltrating extremist organisations. On 8 January 2011, Swami Aseemanand, a pracharak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), confessed that he was involved in the bombing of Samjhauta express, a statement he later claimed to have made under duress.Aseemanand claimed that he was tortured to give a false statement.There have also been allegations that Lashkar-e-Taiba was responsible for the bombings. The United States declared Arif Qasmani, a Pakistani national and alleged 'LeT financier', to be the chief coordinator of the 2006 train bombing in Mumbai as well as the 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings, and labelled him an international terrorist via the United Nations. As of 2013, nobody has been convicted for the crime in India.Ajmer Dargah attackThe Ajmer Dargah blast occurred on 11 October 2007, outside the Dargah (shrine) of Sufi saint Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer, Rajasthan, allegedly by the Hindutva organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its groups. On 22 October 2010, five accused perpetrators, of which four said to belong to the RSS, were arrested in connection with the blast. Swami Aseemanand, in his confession, implicated the then General Secretary Mohan Bhagwat for ordering the terrorist strike.Bhavesh Patel, another accused in the bombings, has corroborated these statements but later said that the Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde forced him to implicate the RSS leaders. Some other senior Congress leaders were also mentioned.2008 Malegaon blastsOn 29 September 2008, three bombs exploded in the States of Gujarat and Maharashtra killing 8 persons and injuring 80. During the investigation in Maharashtra, a Hindu group was alleged to have been involved in the blasts. Three of the arrested persons were identified as Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur,Shiv Narayan Gopal Singh Kalsanghra and Shyam Bhawarlal Sahu. All three were produced before the Chief Judicial Magistrate’s court in Nashik, which remanded them to custody till 3 November. On 28 October, the Shiv Sena, came out in support of the accused saying that the arrests were merely political in nature. Lending credence to this, the party chief, Uddhav Thackeray, pointed out a potential conflict of interest in political rivalry as the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) controlled the relevant ministry. NIA, National Investigation Agency, has found no evidence against Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur and it has recommended the court to drop all charges against her.The Army officer Prasad Shrikant Purohit was also accused of being involved in the blast. His counsel alleged that he was being falsely framed for political reasons because he has intelligence data of a sensitive nature pertaining to the operations of Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, which could embarrass some quarters.Mecca Masjid bombingThe Mecca Masjid bombing occurred on 18 May 2007 inside the Mecca Masjid, a mosque in Hyderabad. Fourteen people were reported dead in the immediate aftermath. The National Investigation Agency, Central Bureau of Investigation and Anti Terrorist Squad (India) questioned former members of the RSS On 19 November 2010, the Central Bureau of Investigation produced Swami Aseemanand before the court in connection with the Blast. But later he has retracted the confession citing the mental and physical pressure to provide that confession. The Special investigation Team (SIT) of Hyderabad Police arrested ‘south India commander’ of the LeT, identified as Shaik Abdul Khaja alias Amjad, from Afzalgunj area of the city. Police said that the arrestee was linked to Mohammed Abdul Shahid Bilal, key suspect in the bombing.The South Asia Terrorism Portal, the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, the National Counter-terrorism Center the United States, and the United Nations reported that Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami was actually behind the attacks while excluding involvement by any Hindu group. Noting this, security analyst Bahukutumbi Raman has questioned "the two different versions that have emerged from Indian and American investigators."The South Asia Terrorism Portal cited Vikar Ahmed as a main suspect in the blast. Mohammed Abdul Shahid Bilal, former chief of HuJI’s Indian operations, is also regarded as a key suspect in the Mecca Masjid bombing. Later he was shot by unknown gunmen in Karachi on 30 August 2007.as we can see the fact that all the above attacks were indirectly or directly involved with pakistan and not by any hindu partiesfor stupid reason every sickular party tries to blame RSS, BJP and other hindu parties</comment>

<comment>Subramaniya Swamy should first stop speaking in the Pakistani language Hindi and use Indian languages instead. SUbramaniya Swamy will  remains a Muslimized man if he continues using the Islamic country outsourced language. We already know Narendra Modi is a Muslim hiding in a HIndu name. A HIndu person would never support the rejection of  Indian languages and replacement with the Islamic origin language HIndi which did not make original contributions to the HIndu religion.The conspiracy to convert India to an Islamic nation by imposition of the Pakistani language in Sanskrit script Hindi must stop.</comment>

<comment>They copied sanskrit n hindi</comment>

<comment>Sure they did, but they by majority copied from Muslim country's languages even for simple expressions. A comparison with Farsi, Arabic will give you an idea.</comment>

<comment>Abhey ch u tya ... sanskrit s the oldest language... many languages have been made frm it....n it is Tamilian who fought for hindi to be our National language... n relax  no one s going to stop u from speakung ur mother tongue.... we have much bigger problems to worry about.</comment>

<comment>No country would want to have an enemy country's language as National lanuguage, we have Indian languages for that. Narendra Modi's Muslim religion of course command treatment of people outside the religion as lower status. The reason why Hindi terrorists from Pakistan enter India so easily is part the Narendra Modi ' s plan to convert India into an Islamic slave nation of pakistan.Chuthiya surely does not look like a Sanskrit word. The Funny thing is that even the foul words of the Islamic origin language are outsourced from Islamic countries.</comment>

<comment>U r insane...get ur facts right....must hv been brainwaashed by ur tomil politicians</comment>

<comment>This is bitter truth and conspiracy by the Hindu imposters including Modi, Subramani, Iranian education lady, Sushma, Rajnath, etc etc etc etc to Muslimize India. Media dont want to tell these people are either secret Muslims or their puppets. Hindi and Hindu are not related the same way Sanskrit, Tamil, Kannada, Awadhi, MAlayalam, Telugu etc etc and Indian languages. You can visit temples for the proof.</comment>

<comment>N u are frm Mars?</comment>

<comment>National languages should be Indian languages, not Pakistani language in Sanskrit script. Chuthiya is surely NOT a Sanskrit word, it is the same word used by Pakistani terrorists when attack and murder the "infidels".We have much biggest problems to worry, one of which includes Muslimization of India  by the Muslim Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who just rejected Indian lanuguages from becoming official languages. And we should not forget that Iranian woman who messed with the CBSE, ICSE school syllabusNorth Indians have abandoned Indian languages and adoptedMuslim country outsourced languages. Rape culture of North India is surely imported from Muslim countries. The Muslim Prime Minister  Narendra Modi has bigger plans.Its Islamic Steal Jihad in action.</comment>

<comment>Haha...you r funny</comment>

<comment>Actually, it not funny. The workings of this PM is not consistent with his claim as a HIndu leader. He just rejected the very languages that contributed to the Hindu religion. THe PM appears to be yet another example of a Muslim doing Taqiyya to spread his religion. Khangress and BJP for that matter dont appear to be different. JUst 2 competing Muslim parties to spread Islam.</comment>

<comment>Yeah very true you cartoon, going by your logic even English has Islamic origin. Why r u wasting your bandwidth? Just bother about your country languages, you have Pastho, Urdu, Sindhi, Baluchi etc. but still when you tried to impose Urdu on poor Bengali's of East Pakistan, you must be knowing what happened, it became Bangladesh so don't preach us on what is origin of which language & who is from which origin. First accept the fact that Jinnah was a shia & publicly buried as sunni person. Remove hypocrisy from your society & protect the minorities in your country then think of commenting about us.</comment>

<comment>English did not have Islamic origin. HIndi did. HIndi surely is not a pure Indian language. F and Z sound words are all Islamic origin. Hindi is a language outsourced from Muslim nations and did not contribute to the Hindu religion.  The Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a secret Muslim man which is why he rejected the Indian language petition. Its Islamic Taqiyya in action. Mod's imposition of Pakistani language Hindi is to pave the way for his Muslim friends from Pakistan to murder "infidels" by allowing them free access across India.In Islam, the religion is to be spread using "stealth jihad", without war or direct attack. In India, it is done through pakistani language Hindi imposition in schools, PM speech, insurance companies, banks, MNCs, toll free numbers, government schemes, advertisements etc etc. So conversion of Indian language speakers into Islamic origin language Hindi speakers is the intermediate stage of Islamic jihad (cultural jihad).What happens when all of the "infidels" languages are eradicated and people only speak the Muslim outsourced language, it becomes very easy for  Hindi terrorists from Pakistan to roam across India and do "armed religious duty". Eventual goal is to establish Islam all over India. That is the very goal of this Muslim Prime minister Narendra Modi.</comment>

<comment>Don't blabber boss. Just read the history of Hindi & Urdu languages, you head will be clear. I respect both language & enjoy the writings in both as well & going by your logic why do you have many languages except Urdu or Arabic in various other Islamic/ Muslim countries.</comment>

<comment>THe history of the Islamic origin language Hindi=Urdu is much less compared to history of Indian languages. It does not matter if this language is young or old, however the Muslim Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan by rejecting Indian languages from the Indian language official language petition is part of the plan to eventual convert India as an Islamic nation.</comment>

<comment>Muslim outsourced languages are not surely pure Indian languages and came from Islamic rape of India. The Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a SECRET MUSLIM. BJP is NOT a Hindu party it claims. Islamic Taqiyya in action.</comment>

<comment>Pakistani spotted.</comment>

<comment>ANd they are the Pakistani language Hindi speakers.</comment>

<comment>The Janata Party president, Subramanian Swamy, has criticised the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Sonia Gandhi, for not demanding the ``dismissal of the Gujarat Government''.                                           In a statement here, he said ,``the leader of the Opposition has called on the Prime Minister yesterday to demand the deployment of the Army in Gujarat. A genuine leader would have instead demanded the dismissal of the Gujarat Government for its complicity in the Ahmedabad backlash riot yesterday and utter failure to protect the minorities in that city''.Courtesy : The Hindu dated March 2, 2002</comment>

<comment>He believes in by SC order and that Modi has no role in it. Going by it you are simply harping on dead</comment>

<comment>What the point of all this? Religious belief in the country has not changed it for centuries. Can one temple or mosque change it in few years?This is just satisfying for a major section of religious followers.</comment>

<comment>maybe they thought that after that mandir is made they all will become very affluent. Little do they know that this is also a means of raising money from the general public and for such a cause even a poor man will give due to his beliefs (or rather, ignorance). From that huge sum, many people will become overnight millionaires if not billionaires. I just feel sorry that people are so naive even to this day. Had people demanded more universities and hospitals then I will be among the first to support and even contribute.</comment>

<comment>God is not asking for masjid or Mandir. Politicians cannot solve earthly problems like water, goverence and poverty and equality. So they turn heavenly ...god need that, god need this, ....idiots ....they spilled a lot of blood of innocent Indians ....still not satisfied </comment>

<comment>You did not read the Manifesto before election.</comment>

<comment>It is always easy to ride on emotions than fulfilling your poll promises.  Feku knows that the people of this Country are dumb idiots hugely susceptible to emotional over reach !!</comment>

<comment>So do you possess the emotion meter? This is not going to charge any emotions for Hindus neither others become envy of it</comment>

<comment>Dear Irrationalist / Loverboy Which country is not susceptible to emotions?</comment>

<comment>So, this is your tame defence !?It is always the degree of severity which counts  !!</comment>

<comment>Dear Loverboy, you seem to be high on emotions right now ...today full moon! So, lot of emotion filled Irrational Arguments.Later You'll prove my points Corrupt/ Irrationalist</comment>

<comment>Just labeling something as irrational doesn't suffice unless you take the effort to substantiate it !!You are an idiot who believes in mythological fairy tale and calling me an irrational and there lies the irony !!</comment>

<comment>Michael Jackson - What are you really doing here when you must be doing your favourite moon walking dance !?</comment>

<comment>Not really, the last part that is, the people of this country are ....The people of this country have been evolving in fact.1) The UPA crossed all limits in their arrogance and incompetence to rein in corruption in the run up to the 2014 elections. I do believe the public wanted to teach them a lesson. BJP just happened to be in the right place at the right time. However, BJP was unable to dent Odisha, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal2) In all the states the BJP won thereafter, there were weak incumbents. People of Maharashtra were totally fed up of NCP / Congress alliance.3) The BJP faced credible challenges in Delhi and Bihar state elections. We know the results. Secularists proclaimed these results as a great victory for everything that stands against BJP, but I doubt people voted on religious / communal lines. They possibly voted for better local governance. I don't know how successful their efforts have been, BJP will tell you Delhi is much worse than say 14th century London today and AAP will have you believe that residents of the 'City' in 2015 - 16 are seeking Indian Visas to settle down at Karol Bagh.4) UP has had atrocious governance even by say Sub Saharan African standards, these past few years. Especially law and order. I expect BJP to win UP handsomely. BJP / Nationalists / Assorted supporters will paint this victory as a great slap on the face of the 'sickulars' , libtards, pressti.. etc. However, I have my own doubts, whether people would have been swayed by gou mata and Ram Mandir or they just really want jobs and disposable income and a police force that protects homo sapien citizens also, not just Janab Azam Khan Saab's buffaloes.In India, we don't have a secular party that works and is non corrupt or a communal party that does not promise development. Till such time, we may enjoy in the rather interesting pastime of guessing and attributing.</comment>

<comment>With all things going in its favour, all that the BJPee could manage with Feku at the helm was just 31% of the votes as a single party and 37.40% as the conglomerate of NDA coalition out of the 66% of the population that voted.  And this despite the 10 year anti-incumbency against the UPA Government which ofcourse had many skeletons tumbling out of his cupboard coupled with the blitzrkrieg campaign launched by Feku funded by sleaze Corporate money a year before the elections !!If you just a take at all the voting figures during the Lok sabha poll, you will be surprised to find miniscule and even independents polling substantial number of votes and it is not that people are voting only for the major parties in the fray.  They are just beneficiaries of vote fragmentation more than anything else !!Feku made a lot of poll promises including the reckless promise of recovering Black money within 100 days and consequently  deposit of Rs. 15 lakhs in every account. This ofcourse was  termed as mere Jumla by the Party President for hood winking the masses in a Times of India interview. More over most of the Policies of UPA which the BJPee opposed including Aadhar, cash transfer, FDI in Insurance/Defence, GST etc., are all being implemented with tremendous zeal and ironically the one policy which the BJPee supported feverishly in Parliament ie. Land Acquisiton bill where it impressed upon the then Government on the floor of the House not to amend it any cost as that would would have a delibitating impact on the farming community was ofcourse shamelessly over turned after just 4 months in power whereby it brought amendements to the Act by ejecting out Social Impact assessment and the consent clause !!Regarding your optimism of the BJPee winning handsomely in UP, I do not think that will be the case and it might finish only as the third largest party behind the BSP and SP. We will discuss that in 2017 as the time is not ripe now !!</comment>

<comment>I see where you are coming from, but apart from the last para of your above post, fail to see where you differ from my overall views. We both seem to be saying the same thing!I am not optimistic about BJP victory in UP. It is merely my estimate, an amateur's attempts at predicting election results. Optimism, typically has a connotation of buy in with the results, please don't attribute that to me, I prefer to think of myself as politically neutral.</comment>

<comment>In your 4th point, you did state that you expected the BJP to win UP handsomely and so I reacted only to that misplaced optimism  stating that it is quite premature as things are fluid at this stage and the Feku mania that gripped UP for considerable section of the populace has evaporated as the sheen has tapered off !!Nevertheless, I know for well that you are politically neutral and not affiliated to any party or ideology or admirer of personality and that is testified by many of your comments which I chance to glance over. You are among the very few sane Posters we have in this forum !!</comment>

<comment>I wonder how much RAM you have in your chip?</comment>

<comment>First, the thousands of Temples dedicated to Ram in Ayodhya and Faizabad have to come to a consensus on which temple is exactly the birth place of Ram ?  The Trustees and Priest of every Temple located there  claims that it is their sanctum sanctorum where Ram was actually born.  So you guys better sort that out before trying to expect others to respect your beliefs  !?</comment>

<comment>"The RSS game plan is thus ready. Only the D-Day for the blitzkrieg is to be determined. Since it appears that the RSS has already been generating momentum on religious fundamentalist issues (for example, Gujarat's Ram temple) and raised the fanatical emo tional temperature (chasing of Christian missionaries), my guess is that this campaign will be taken to a fever pitch by November 9, 2001 (the 1986 date for shilanyas) and then mid-term elections will be called.Prime Minister Vajpayee will as usual waffle and wobble, but he will not resist. That is his nature; he is a mask for the RSS, as Commissar Govindacharya had once said."Excerpts from the article written by Subramaniam Swamy in Front line in its issue publicized between  January 22 and February 4, 2000.

<comment>Beliefs should be based on truth, which should be based on reason and evidence.       Beliefs that are based on indoctrination, superstition or just assumption don't merit respect.     They should be questioned and must be defended.       If they can't be defended, they why should they be respected ?</comment>

<comment>"According to Hindu scripture and the present law, a Praan-Pratisthit Vigraha (deity) is a living entity and a deity (Ramlala) can hold the property"And this guy is Harvard educated. Shame on this buffoon !!</comment>

<comment>Then you should be ashamed of Indian judiciary too  because Judiciary also accepts that a deity can hold the property.</comment>

<comment>The verdict has annulled respect for  history and seeks to replace history with faith of certain sects. Thus, law has been made a mockery by the Judges themselves who are upholders of Constitutional principles.  Law should only be based on evidence and not premised upon faith which is sheer ridiculous.  The verdict also took into account the excavations of the Archaelogical Survey of India and its readings but totally ignoring the fact that this has been disputed by other Archaelogists and Historians. Since this is matter which is seemingly complicated, the categorical acceptance of just one point of view just doesn't hold ground and can never inspire confidence that the verdict was fair.  Nevertheless, matters have gone to the SC and we have to wait for its verdict  !!</comment>

<comment>It does not matter what you think about SC... or your opinion about how HC/SC should function.Regarding those "this has been disputed by other Archaeologists and Historians"  - Allahabad HC has addressed the issue  in details.</comment>

<comment>I was commenting only the HC verdict and not the SC by the way which is yet to come up with its judgement on this vexed issue !!Justice should always be based only upon evidence and not subservient to faiths and beliefs  which is the only logical way for a fair, rational, transparent and accountable  justice system !!Moreover, our judges always agree to disagree and many of the High court judgements have been over turned by the SC.  So, let us wait and watch as to what lies in store rather than counting the chickens before they are hatched !!</comment>

<comment>By your comment "Justice should always be based only upon evidence and not subservient to faiths and beliefs which is the only logical way for a fair, rational, transparent and accountable justice system !!"Do you mean to say that Justice has been subverted ? Any proof ?And everyone has agreed that they will accept SC verdict.  Then what's the issue ?</comment>

<comment>Justice has definitely been subverted and vitiated when the HC judges based their judgement on this issue riding on falsifiable faiths and beliefs !!"everyone has agreed that they will accept SC verdict.  Then what's the issue ?"Only if this wisdom had prevailed upon the BJPee and VHP  leaders then, the Country would have been saved of the orgy of yatras, processions, demolition, riots, blood shed, loss of innumerable lives, property etc., costing immensely to this Nation with uprising of terror activies as a backlash.  At that time, senile Advani was claiming on roop tops that matters of faith cannot be decided by the Courts and unfortunately the HC judges have proven Advani wrong when they themselves held placards for faith and beliefs  !!</comment>

<comment>Frankly,  I have more faith on Judiciary   then on you & your interpretation.</comment>

<comment>It is obvious that you don't have any valid counters !!</comment>

<comment>That's what  even courts have stated Allahbad court has considered Ramlalla as one party</comment>

<comment>Yes he stated what s writtenWhy harvard educated Muslims don't believe that kabbah is  house of allah ?</comment>

<comment>Here the problem is mainly  because it is a disputed site !!</comment>

<comment>Control you language FirstPost.. he not a "maverick politician"</comment>

<comment>Is your antipathy with the word 'maverick' or 'politician'? Just curious. :-)</comment>

<comment>Excellent balanced views by Subramaniam Swamy ji. If he succeeds, in his efforts, peacefully, he will truly go down in History as one of the greatest heroes of modern India, who was able to solve a tricky issue (although the courts would rule), amicably.</comment>

<comment>True. Very well said, sir. But sadly, no political party in India ( neither BJP nor Congress)wants to settle this issue. If this issue is settled, then they'll have to find a new issue to divide and rule the people of our country.... Swami, right now feels correct to me. But he's too a politician. Can't trust him.. </comment>

<comment>EXCELLENT ?  READ MY EARLIER BLOG AND REPLY IT IF YOU CAN.</comment>

<comment>I don't promise to read it, unless it's reasonably short. However, where may I find your earlier blog please? Could you furnish a link?</comment>

<comment>Just read the blog. However, I don't fully agree with what you say. Will reply later, if possible, too tied up with timelines at the moment.One request, can you please post in the usual 'Sentence case' instead of all CAPS, makes it easier to read, that's all. Cheers.</comment>

<comment>Chuppswamy enjoys his daughter gets fakked by a Muzzi Kutlet...Yet he wants Ram Mandir?Joke of the year</comment>

<comment>hope your wisdom prevails till 2019... :D</comment>

<comment>"Wisdom" is sure to raise leaps and bounds, because people are more and more able to differentiate left from the right; and light from the darkness.</comment>

<comment>yes and right to the darkness.....</comment>

<comment>Ancient Rome had more advanced toilets compared to those in modern India. The priorities of this country is so far removed from reality that I sometimes think that people just live to exist.</comment>

<comment>Mahen-jo daro had a much better system...  But we don't have.  Yes, our priorities are so different now-a-days.</comment>

<comment>Will Vatican allow their Paedo-mafia town razed down to the ground and erect a 'Minaret' in that place ??</comment>

<comment>Priorities have been hijacked by the political class owing to illiteracy and poverty.</comment>

<comment>Build a meditation centre there, for people who get all hyper and enraged, at the drop of a hat.</comment>

<comment>Meditation centre can be built anywhere and it would be the same, but the significance of that place in the cultural and religious mindspace of hindus warrants a temple and nothing else. </comment>

<comment>Kya Avnesh, as if Lord Ram gives a damn :)</comment>

<comment>Mam  i understand ur point  ... But still Bhavya Ram Mandir is a very good idea... Becoz then we can move on from this topic  to other  important things. ... N Ram Mandir will also bring lots of tourists...  n  it will soon  make Ayodhya a  top tourist destination...  which will improve the lives of locals...  so i support this movement...</comment>

<comment>++++Mr SWAMY,  HINDU SCRIPTURES MAY SAY ANY THING ABOUT THE OWNERSHIP OF LAND.  ALL THOSE ARE APPLICABLE ONLY TO SETTLE THE ISSUES WITHIN THE HINDU COMMUNITY.  A MUSLIM HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.  SIMILARLY MUSLIM SCRIPTURE OR QURAN MAY SAY ANYTHING.  THAT IS TO BE APPLIED ONLY WITHIN THE MUSLIM, A HINDU HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.  WHEN A DISPUTE IS BETWEEN INTER RELIGIONS,  A COMMON UNIVERSAL LAW HAS TO BE APPLIED AND THAT IS THE JUSTICE.

IN THE PROCESS OF INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT PEOPLE BELONGING TO EVERY RELIGION CONTRIBUTED.  THEY ALL DID SO WITH THE HOPE THAT PEACE AND JUSTICE WILL BE MAINTAINED IN A BETTER WAY AFTER THE INDEPENDENCE.  SO WHY DO YOU WANT TO RUIN THE GOOD HOPES OF THOSE GREAT MEN.  PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEART AND ANSWER THE QUESTION, “  WOULD MAHATMA GANDHI AGREE TO YOUR ARGUMENT JUSTIFYING THE DESTRUCTION OF MASJID AND CONSTRUCTING TEMPLE ON THE SAME LOCATION ? “ YOUR BJP/RSS AGENDA IS TO DIVIDE THE SOCIETY IN THE NAME OF RELIGIONS, CREATE BITTER MUTUAL ANIMOSITY AMONG THEM AND STAND ON THE SIDE OF MAJORITY COMMUNITY IN THAT TROUBLED WATER SO THAT YOUR VICTORY IS ENSURED IN SPITE OF YOUR CORRUPT PRACTICES.

<comment>Don't remember when was the last time i went sight-seeing in a temple neither have plans to go in future , but building of Ram Temple is a MUST.....To salvage some bits of wrong done in last 1000 years and Ram Temple would work as a reminder of what we really are....This is the land of Hindus and not slavery blood-field of the Desert invaders...</comment>

<comment>Anti hindu pappu gandhi is planning new anti hindu movement in india secretly with umar khalid in association with Hafeez saed. he already provoked haryana by putting fuel in jaat. </comment>

<comment>Why somnath was destroyed  6 times by different Muslim Invaders </comment>

<comment>Because they were poor destroyers? </comment>

<comment>There were hindu generals in Mahmud ghaznis army. Hinduism was not confined to India then. Kashmiri hindu kings also looted temples. ( public property)</comment>

<comment>india never invaded other nations.today the muslims who are fighting against hindus were also hindus once 200yrs ago. mughals invaded raped those hindus and forcefully converted them into muslims. now the same muslims grandchildrens are fighting against hindus and preaching islam and thier greatness.</comment>

<comment>Even Ashoka turned against hindus, to convert them to buddhism.</comment>

<comment>ashoka didnt forcefully converted them. i dont have any problem with buddhist. buddhist and hindus are same to me coz. they believe almost same thing. they follow same ideology of peace and prosperity. they dont create problem like muslims.</comment>

<comment>Remember ,persecution of Buddhists by Pushyamitra Shunga?</comment>

<comment>Who created RSS and why  ?  They had no sympathy with hindus or hinduism and their religion is all against what  hinduism stands for, but they did it for ulterior motives  !!</comment>

<comment>haahha.... better u join pappu gandhi brigade. he will give u slogan against RSS. he dont know know anything else other than RSS.</comment>

<comment>Is it soLink plsSomnath was destroyed not only by Gazani but by other Invaders also check WikipediaAurangzeb destroyed kashi vishwanathHis army had hindus alsoDoes that mean Hindus destroyed kashi vishwanath templeDon't putt silly arguments</comment>

<comment>Why Muslims consider babur as thier hero not any SufiSince ke killed Hindus ?</comment>

<comment>Muslims don't consider babur as any hero. Hero worship is not there amongst muslims.</comment>

<comment>Then why defend structure built by him</comment>

<comment>yeah rt? hafeez saeed is thier hero.</comment>

<comment>Even Imran khans photo  used to favorite of so many Muslim shops which I had myself seen</comment>

<comment>In Pakistan they Keep Salman and shah rukh photos in shops</comment>

<comment>You talk like a pakistani.</comment>

<comment>then who ? umar khalid ?</comment>

<comment>You are very narrow in your thinking.</comment>

<comment>then who is broad in thinking? umar khalid who is brainwashing JNU and contaminating the campus with his dirty mind ?</comment>

<comment>I don't know about JNU politics but there is no idol worship in Islam. Patriotism is intrinsic to Islam.</comment>

<comment>"Patriotism is intrinsic to Islam."  -  This part is tough to follow.  Ba'athist party in many Islamic countries survived as single country because they had a Nationalistic substratum.   Once that part got destroyed, there are many revolts based on tribal identities. You can see it in Iraq,  Syria, Libya.Pakistan is a bit different.  Most of them are conscious of their nation.  No doubt Bangladesh drifted apart.  Jiye Sindh, Balochistan,  NFWP all had/has asked for separation from time to time.   But their  hatred for external cause (created & nurtured through a  ingenious  narrative)  has kept them together.The present day flourishing of Jihadi groups indicate that a small percentage of Islamists do not bother about their Nations in the first place.</comment>

<comment>islam is regressive. islamic nations are backward and fragile states. only middle east like UAE or saudi are rich and developing coz of oil money.</comment>

<comment>What Muslims would have done if same happened to thier own mosques Why they are fighting with Jews to get Al asqa mosque back ?</comment>

<comment>Wrong Al Aqsa mosque is already with the muslims the jews are out to drive them out.</comment>

<comment>U are unaware its entry is regulated by jews</comment>

<comment>they have come there only after Israel came into existence.</comment>

<comment>Babur was gay,drinker,barbarian ruler as per his own admission in baburnama</comment>

<comment>but the most famous gay was mahumad ghazni...uske baare mein to poems bhi likhe hure hain.!!!</comment>

<comment>Its haram to build a mosque over another relogious structure </comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>The PM has already said toilets first, temple later.</comment>

<comment>No relation as such</comment>

<comment>We want ram mandir backThose 100 temples don't match with significance of ram mandir</comment>

<comment>Alright.  If you want Ram Mandir back,  then see that all hindus in this country support a political party which supports Hinduism.  You know very well that Congress requires votes of Hindus but hates Hinduism. India is the only country in this world in which a Hindu can say that I am a "Hindu".</comment>

<comment>Huh? For your last sentence</comment>

<comment>WE WANT RAM MANDITx9OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</comment>

<comment>What the eff is the last word '?</comment>

<comment>Why so much debate? If 39,997 mosques exist on temples, 3 temples is nothing.I don't think Muslims will have any issues.They have enough work to do to uplift their community. Shri Ram temple is hardly their concern.Let's build these 3 and move on. Plenty of nation building work is left. </comment>

<comment>When the Country is facing serious problems within and Modiji is on record that certain  quarters are destabilise him and his Govt, this is not the time to rake up an issue which is on the back burner</comment>

<comment>Do Lord Rama really need a house at a particular place ? Dr Swami, where do you think Lord Rama live ? He who is there in every tiny particle and covers entire space cannot be looking for a home for Himself. It is unnecessary issue and a true religious Hindu has nothing to do with it. Why can't we make a monument of Peace at the place and make a grand temple of Lord Rama somewhere else nearby ? We have already generated a lot of bad blood in the name of God. Let's stop it.</comment>

Subba Swamy and L.K Advani have a few years to Live atleast repent and do some Good service DO SOME SOCIAL GOOD by Building School,. colleges, Hospital, provide drinking water ,road uplift the lower caste like the SC ST and other OBC from discrimination and poverty.BUILDING RAM TEMPLE WITH ONLY HARED BUT NO LOVE OR COMPASSION WILL   NOT SERVICE LORD RAM BUT THE DEVIL/SAITAN LIKE XXXXX destroying the country soul .HAI RAM RAM JAI RAMJIKI . LORD RAM WILL NOT WANT  KILLERS, ROGUES AND CRIMINALS TO BUILT A TEMPLE ON HIS NAME .JAI RAM</comment>

<comment>well said.</comment>

<comment>It is a shirk who destroyed Ram temple of Ayodya where Ram was.born.That act of Shirk  questions our core value of secularism. Ram is in the heart of people of India and want a tmeple where his temple existed in Ayodya.If reservation can be considered for Jats on the basis of population then by this time Ram temple should have been there at the dipsuted site.</comment>

<comment>Please don't take name of Lord Ram.  Lord Ram  would not want that an invading group will destroy religious places in the first place.</comment>

<comment>Killers, Rogues and Criminals? You are confusing Congress with Subramaniam Swamy</comment>

<comment>Mr. Swamy, you be a great economist and a fighting lawyer for right thing. But you don't know what to talk and when. When the country is is being torn apart by  scoundrel attacking the nation and its beloved soldiers what is the necessity to take up this issue you now. All countries are mocking at India because of wrong priorities, farmers are committing suicides, people don't have food, clothing and shelter, health facilities, education our priorities are freedom of expression, right to criticise country, temple building etc. If you have an iota of respect, please contribute to nation building.</comment>

<comment>So you want approval of others to do anything, right ?</comment>

<comment>You don't know his past do you? He drafted our nations nuclear policy in 1965.Same is followed ever since.Have YOU done any such big work?</comment>

<comment>So when is the right time?</comment>

<comment>SCAMY HIMSELF IS AN EXTREMIST ELEMENT.  SO HE SHOULD BE DEALT WITH STERNLY.</comment>

<comment>ndtv is not neutral...it only pretends to be neutral..these are my personal views...INDIA HAS HIGHEST NUMBER OF POOR PEOPLE IN WHOLE WORLD...millions are dying becoz of "malnutrition"...yes mere dost..bhooke mar rahe hain log yaha..har koi tere mere jese lucky NAHI he...there are many more burning issues in india.... they deserve attention and media space...entire paraphrenelia should be used to uplift ourselves and get out of this rut...THIS IS EXACTLY HOW POOR COUNTRIES BECAME RICH AND DEVELOPED IN MATTER OF 2-3 DECADES...becoz they know the priorities...japan,malyasia.china.brazil,singapore....and a lot many more countries were POORER THAN INDIA!!!!...aur ab dekho wo kaha.....aur hum kaha....samjha karo yaar. first set the priorities right.</comment>

<comment>Ram temple was not built for 65 years since independence, please let me know how NOT building ram temple improved everything you are pointing to?</comment>

<comment>i am talking about the media space that non-issues occupy and the extreme importance that we pple of india give to non-issues....thus diverting our attention from the other burning issues which genuinely require our attention to build a new,shining,strong and developed india...aur kab tak is traha ladte jhagte rahenge aur gutter me pade rahenge??....</comment>

<comment>single issue will solve everything...it is the collective effort which solves everything...this mandir,masjid,caste etc is only bogging india down...and we will foreever remain in this rut becoz of giving too much importance to non-issues(this is just one of many non-issues).....dekho kese parliament thap pada hua he..pachas salo se...har chote chote baaton me jhagda karke....and politicians alone are not responsible for it..WE the foolish people of india are also responsible for it...yes we!!....japan.south korea germany....kahi bhi aese nahi hota he..sirf yehi hota he... sirf wahi desh develop hota he..jinka priorities right ho...nahi to india, nepal, paki, ki traha haalat hota he.......boond boond se sagar banta he..its only.the collective effort which solves problems....aur ye mandir masjid is only a part of many non-issues which we fight and waste time on.....DONT YOU AGREE??..</comment>

<comment>Simple question : Will  the act of 'Not building Ram Temple ' would automatically solve all the above issues...</comment>

<comment>no single questin or single issue will solve everything...it is the collective effort which solves everything...this mandir,masjid,caste is only bogging india down...and we will foreever remain in this rut becoz of giving too much importance to non-issues...dekho kese parliament thap pada hua he..pachas salo se...har chote chote baaton...and politicians alone responsible for it..WE the foolish people of india are also responsible for it...yes we!!....japan.south korea germany....kahi bhi aese nahi hota he..sirf yehi hota he... sirf wahi desh develop hota he..jinka priorities right ho...nahi to india, nepal, paki, ki traha haalat hota he.......boond boond se sagar banta he..its the collective effort which solves the problems...........aur ye mandir masjid is only a part of a problem...</comment>

<comment>Buddy... that's what i meant by my original point that NDTV has some indirect impact on you....>> Comparison bw India and Germany/Japan totally unfair...>>Its not about 'Mandir , masjid ' ...Ram temple for e.g is a source for extracting an upper hand between civilization tussle , and not merely 'one more Temple ' to have your shoes stolen at ...Will answer in detail , later... !</comment>

<comment>no not unfair...go and check gdp per capita of india,germany and japan just before 1950...they were completely devasted and became much much poorer than india...i can give a name of 50 countries which were much poorer than india and now much better developed than india....dekho ab itna difference hogaya ki tum compare tak nhi kar paa rahe!!!!!!!!!!.....</comment>

<comment>Were Khangress in the power there , too ?? No.... that should give some clue...</comment>

<comment>tune mera question ka jawab nhi diya....the point is 1950's or even before or after we were in better position than many other countries...other countries set their priorities right..we didnt...we were fighting and voting on the basis of hindus muslims castes ethinicities...and above all for money,biryani daaru...hamne choose kiya he unhe..wo hame nahi ...tum khud hi dekhlo..itne intelligent or rational ho...but still u r thinking about faltu mandi masjid and may vote for modi..even if ur mla is a rapist...just becoz he represents modi....wohi to problem he...kharabi tere me or mere me he...politicians are just our reflections....we have to get rid of this corrupt system...aap may or may not do it...but atleast there is hope.....</comment>

I keep seeing pappu, khujili, rajdeep, burkha and co keep shouting about protection of sausages...So...why the visceral hatred for gays my friend?Did a gay church father or gay Muhammad touch you in 'places' when you were young?</comment>

<comment>aur nahi banane se bhar jayega kya?? ajib baat kaarte ho yaar...</comment>

<comment>i am talking about the media space that non-issues occupy and the extreme importance that we pple of india give to non-issues....thus diverting our attention from the other burning issues which genuinely require our attention to build a new,shining,strong and developed india...aur kab tak is traha ladte jhagte rahenge aur gutter me pade rahenge??....aur ye mandir masjid is only a part of many non-issues which we fight and waste time on.....DONT YOU AGREE??..</comment>

<comment>well if we dont fight now pretty soon there will be no india to live in...just watch what is happening in our neighboring countries be it pakistan or bangladesh or nepal...if these anti national forces hijack the indian media then any day they can do anything</comment>

<comment>.INDIA HAS HIGHEST NUMBER OF POOR PEOPLE IN WHOLE WORLD...millions are dying becoz of "malnutrition"...yes mere dost..bhooke mar rahe hain log yaha..har koi tere mere jese lucky NAHI he...there are many more burning issues in india.... they deserve attention and media space...entire paraphrenelia should be used to uplift ourselves and get out of this rut...THIS IS EXACTLY HOW POOR COUNTRIES BECAME RICH AND DEVELOPED IN MATTER OF 2-3 DECADES...becoz they know the priorities...japan,malyasia.china.brazil,singapore....and a lot many more countries were POORER THAN INDIA!!!!...aur ab dekho wo kaha.....aur hum kaha....samjha karo yaar. first set the priorities right.....</comment>

<comment>Yeah mate, go ahead and make a magnificent temple. But also please enlighten us, how and when would this have a bearing on India's existing issues like unemployment, illiteracy, corruption and poverty?</comment>

<comment>So you mean to say , that for last so many decades India has been a land of bubbling honey , where milk fizzles in the river , common men eat in gold plates and commute in their own personal  Robinson R-44(Helicopter) ??Coz Temple hasn't been build , yet..??</comment>

<comment>For sickulars,  yes...</comment>

<comment>Please make the temple</comment>

<comment>Banao yaar, temple banao, mosque banao, church banao, sab banao. After we all need a place to worship. Kash Gareebo ka ghar bana lete pehle...kaam dila dete...cheeze kum bao mein milthe, ye sab toh hoga, lekin kya hum log badal nahi sakhthe....bas yuhi ek dusre ko din rat online galiya aur rudeness dikhane se kya fayda...isse nafrat hi padega..pyar badao...Desh ko aage bado. I don't beleive in any political party...only few politicians who work hard!!!Kash sab aise hote...</comment>

<comment>aur conversion karo, aur conversion karo, garibo ko aur pagal banao.. bahar ke paise se pehle garib ka pet bhar dete uske baad conversion ka raag alaapte tab jyada accha hota.</comment>

<comment>english ben hindi me bolta hai... wah</comment>

<comment>I dont know , but may be in your country 'His' calls for a she...</comment>

<comment>Oh ... Abhi tak to im in that country only ... Where kitne janmon ke paap ke Karan janam Lena padta hai ...</comment>

<comment>Only  a congi fanboy gets offended by those Golden words said in China....Still feeling acid burning  in the  back area kya ???</comment>

<comment>A true nationalist will always feel for his mother ... Even if she's poor ... Taking sides and name calling might be your birthright ... I myself ... Leave alone My country's leader shouldn't and can't be ashamed or apologetic of his/her pedigree ...</comment>

<comment>Well you  may  misconstrue  a person handing you a bouquet of beautiful , bright flowers  as some kind of an attack and shoot him in return..  Therefore if you have a predetermined mind to intentionally pick a meaning different from the intended one , then go ahead nobody can help you...</comment>

<comment>Ditto to you ...</comment>

<comment>Ohh... !! As  if the act  of 'Not building Ram Temple ' would automatically solve all the above issues...</comment>

<comment>Don't remember when was the last time i went sight-seeing in a temple neither have plans to go in future , but building of Ram Temple is a MUST.....To salvage some bits of wrong done in last 1000 years and Ram  Temple would work as a reminder of what we really are....This is the land of Hindus and not slavery blood-field of the Desert invaders...</comment>
