<comment>Sigmund Freud father of psychoanalysis said "mother worship" when asked to define India. Continuing this analysis. Arnab Goswami goes slightly wrong when he says even left loves India. Love non-mediated by religion turns motherly love to love for female. That is why Left is intent of screwwing India.  That love is sexual love for mother, motherland. Jats and Kapus in Andhra Pradesh[who have burnt a train] are demanding reservation. That is again immoral sexual love for motherland.Such effect of predatory sexual love for motherland [nothing wrong with motherly love]has even led to murder of motherland in history as following shows.Dahir was BRAHMIN King in Sindh. By enlisting the support of local tribes (such as the Jats, Meds and Bhuttos) and Buddhist rulers of Nerun, Bajhra, Kaka Kolak and Siwistan as infantry to his predominantly-mounted army, Muhammad bin Qasim defeated Dahir and captured his eastern territories for the Umayyad Caliphate.Dahir then tried to prevent Qasim from crossing the Indus River, moving his forces to its eastern banks. Eventually, however, Qasim crossed and defeated forces at Jitor led by Jaisiah (Dahir's son). Qasim fought Dahir at Raor (near modern Nawabshah) in 712, killing him; Dahir's wife immolated herself (with other women in her household) in accordance with the Hindu tradition of Jauhar.========================================================Academicians have swallowed a fascist lie spread by media that India is a democracy.What a Joke! What about the assault on Individual right of merit by reservation policy? In which country are cities brought to a halt by bandhs? Media should first say India was a Ocholocracy[mob rule].India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] not a democracy. Free speech can be explosive unless it is a part of movement to uproot the Ocholocracy. In a Ocholocracy INDIVIDUAL rights are murdered by definition with help of state. Examples of murder of INDIVIDUAL right are reservation policy which is murder of merit, an INDIVIDUAL right and socialism(by definition legal robbery) which is murder property right, another INDIVIDUAL right.Why are Indians not trusted with free gun laws as in USA? Answer to this simple question demolishes free speech argument.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why were leftists associated with secessionists? The culture of socialist legal robbery is manifesting itself as secessionism - because the socialists may have realized it is impossible to come to an understanding on who the supreme dictator should be and they want to establish numerous single part dictatorships over fragments of country.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just voting does not make India democracy. Protection of rights of the smallest minority the INDIVIDUAL MAKES A SYSTEM DEMOCRATIC. The problem is, India is an Ocholocracy[mob rule] where Individual rights are murdered[example is murder of merit an Individual right by reservation policy and property rights by socialism. Socialism is legal robbery.A period of good dictatorship may be required to cure Indians of disease of bad democracy, due to the infection of socialism or legal robbery. Otherwise bad democracy can kill in millions like in Cambodia under Pol Pot. Ocholocracy looks like democracy but it is not. Just look at immorality of Indians- Laloo the reason for largest migration of Biharis from Bihar was reelected.------------------------------------------------------------It is logically wrong to allow communist parties to function in a multi party democracy as they are for single party dictatorship - they openly state it!

<comment>The parents of students are to be blamed. How can they see their kids turn to terrorists and anti-nationals. Suckers are they.</comment>

<comment>JNU students are spoiled brats, surviving and sucking tax payers money and part time doing anti-national activities. It hurts a lot that we have gone through so much pain paying high fees south here in karnataka to get good education and do good to our country and family. We never asked why so much fees inspite of unable to see parents pay it with so so much difficulties. The JNU students are idiots who have no understanding of how it feels to get educated by hard earned money, instead these suckers are free loaders who know only to strike instead of reading and making use of the chance given to them. They can do all these when they are out, not freely sucking on tax payers money.Always wondered all life why cant education be free, But if these are the kinds of students India gets because of free education, then thanks god we dont have free education for all in India. These ** students are disgrace.</comment>

<comment>If you had studies harder and got better marks you too could have enjoyed govt seat in college instead of going south to study in private colleges.</comment>

<comment>Very unfortunate that whole media and so called intellectuals of India are behind the people who are against India, those who call for splitting of nation, those who want to stop any positives happening to the nation just because it is happening with the leadership of a nationalist.</comment>

<comment>Guys .. All these commies including MSM are trying to divert attention from the main topic if raising if anti national slogans..by making it appear anti bjp, anti govt, Hindu vs Muslim, high caste vs low caste. Pl don't fall into the trap. Keep the pressure till the time these commies understand how to respect your motherland...jai hind</comment>

<comment>Good point. But isnt this true of most political parties ? MMS was under the thumb of, and vetod, by the Gandhi family, the CPM suspended Somnath Chaterjee when he refused the diktat of the party on the 2008 on no confidence motion against the nuclear deal. The most vociferous opponents of Trump, Cruz and Sanders comes form their respective party high commands. In fact the only parties where there is no dissension against the party leadership are the ones  that "owned" by an individual or a family. Does GPK find this appealing - authoritarian "family" parties governing a democratic nation ?Strange !!!!!</comment>

<comment>Mr Pramod why don't write about political murders of kerala ...who are you calling rogues?</comment>

<comment>If court lets him off sedition charges then Rajnath & Bassi should resign. And Mahesh Giri should be exit politics.</comment>

<comment>Recent instances of 'High Handedness' of this Goddamn BJP government has shown that it is a party of 'Hindu Goondas' running amock, and NaMo is watching in silence, as if it has his approval. This is all playing to another     'Mega Godhra' which is waiting to happen, when India and Modi will have 'BLACK FACE" and his entire defense that he is innocent in Godhar will  all come 'Unravelling'. There is no doubt that the next Big election will be that of AAP and Congress. Modi's show is over. The BJP Goonda's have taken over, headed by Amit Shah !!!</comment>

<comment>Ted cloud so your logic is that if all child molesters are Christian padre and if we see the high handed was of pope who runs a hawala empire this has shown us that Christians are child molesters? Or goddamn terrorists have shown us that Muslims are all terrorists since entire terrorists are Muslims. Why do you blame Modi for everything? Is it because of your hatred for Hindus and your intent is to divide and terrorize India?</comment>

<comment>Tum commies free loaders kuch bhi karo .. Par jab tumhe sawal poocho to rona shuru</comment>

<comment>The arrogance of Mr O.P.Sharma who openly claimed that he was Mr Jaitley''s counsel to justify his actions makes one wonder if he was acting on his client's advice!</comment>

<comment>The logic tells me that if Roul or Kachoriwala justifies Israt Jahan and she is a terrorist then makes me wonder if they are supporters of terrorism?</comment>

<comment>why is only one side of the incident given prominence by the presstitudes? so it appears the BJP MLA just walked out of his office and beat up that guy without any provocation or being touched?</comment>

<comment>I think they could have used NSA instead of sedition .</comment>

<comment>Mr. Pramod Kumar, your analysis is alarming. But no party arrogant with power will control its cowboy MLA's ,why will anyone listen ?making it un-manageable can facilitate a Emergency-like situation..Maybe our Democracy is now redefined     Freedom of speech.....only FOR the ruling party.Right to protest ...only  BY the ruling partyDifferent point of views ...only  OF the ruling party.</comment>

<comment>What can one do Pramod Saab ? Absolute power has gone into their head  and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  They would not have imagined even in their wildest dreams that they would get a simple majority on their own, but the wonderful thing happened due to host of factors and they have deluded themselves that they are immortal, invincible and here to stay !!And over the last nineteen odd months in power,  the performance on the governance front as well as the Hindutva agenda has been listless, insipid and  disappointing even for its die hard Bhakths to swallow as a bitter pill.  The realization has dawned upon the corridors of the power centre  that mere development slogans pompously postulated during the Lok sabha election campaign might not do the trick and they need to complement that with  resuscitation  of  ultra Nationalism  and that is the reason for messing around with premier Institutions like the JNU, Hyderabad University, FTII etc. with dosage of Hindutva through their Student's wing, the ABVP which is stridently focused to unshackle the spirit of intellectual & cultural  diversity that has graced these Institutions for so long with polar opposite views as the fulcrum and where points of differences are always not viewed as hindrance or challenging a well established narrative  but as means of value addition !!The present Government on the other hand want to unceremoniously disembark  the equilibrium that has prevailed in these Institutions encapsulating the democratic architecture that have been the bulwark and enjoyed the pride of place  in such academia  which made the Nation proud of its diversity and alternative discourse  !!</comment>

<comment>Very biased article. Even more biased comment from you!!</comment>

<comment>Saner comments will look biased and irrational to a man who has internalized biased and prejudice as his characteristic traits !!</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the explanation, and throwing light into how you behave!</comment>

<comment>Ha Ha Ha Ha !!  Look at what you have commented above before pointing fingers at me. I only returned it back in a most polished manner and how does this warrant such a discourteous remark from you !?</comment>

<comment>Polished remarks huh? How can you be graceful when you blame everyone to be a Bhakt and blame the duly elected PM of India as if you are the only smart gig in town ....how arrogant. </comment>

<comment>Very sensible article. It was most foolishly handled situation.If there was anti-national activity happening, proper investigation should have been done and action taken. Banning a meeting and provoking students with sedition charges over speeches is a bull in china shop approach.I dont support the journos,Left or Congress who are working hard to stoke the issue further. I only feel in present environment this is a very tactless move by the govt.PM Modi needs to control ABVP,RSS and all these fringe elements, we voted for Modi'S BJP not for its associates. Students tend to be radical and some calm down once they are out of college but if you are going to monitor every speech then what is the point of democracy?Frankly PM Modi has been very disappointing in his responses.No he cannot continue to pretend he lives in another planet.ABVP,RSS are behind his election and unless he speaks up we assume he is also behind their actions right or wrong.And to all his fans please be objective he is not God.</comment>

<comment>Here are the facts. We the Indian tax payers pay about 3 lacs per student to study at JNU. If they pay about 400 rupees per year and are taking advantage of our tax dollars to justify dividing India and instead of studying spreading terrorism on campus then to be honest they can do that on their home turf but not on my tax paid university campus which is for studies not for spreading terror.</comment>

<comment>You are mixing 2 different issues here.Subsidized education been misused is not the topic.Were these students caught doing anything other than giving speeches? No. IF speaking against India is sedition this is done by most middle class people during tax season.If we have concrete proof of terrorist activity then an arrest is warranted.Mere words cannot be construed as an act of terrorism.</comment>

<comment>Why so biased, Sir?</comment>

<comment>why dont the politcal parties of all type come together and ban politics in camuses... stop dsicussions on topcis other than education..... ah that none will venture into</comment>

<comment>Some of the leaders of most parties have risen as student leaders. The best example is Mr Jaitley himself. The lawyer who is alleged to have beaten up some journos claimed that he was Jaitley's lawyer. Was he acting on the instructions of Mr jaitley? Why do these MLAs or in some cases MPs always precipitate some incident that becomes a big point for the opposition to raise i n the Parliament.</comment>

<comment>Dear it will not happen.. then how BJP, Congress, RSS will make the biryani out of people. People in India talk more about politics not about how to make our India good. If one wants to make it good other tries to create riots and vice versa.</comment>

<comment>Ghello Prmod Kumar must be suffering from yellow fever! His comparison with emergency for the government actions in JNU is not only foolish but do show his bankrupt mind and of course his tolerance for anti national activists in JNU.</comment>

<comment>I think the author is misguided in his thoughts. India under Modi is doing reasonably well and is progressing on all fronts despite several obstructive and obscurantist thugs trying to harm her way. This is no student unrest we are seeing at JNU. It is a small group of anti nationals utilising the institution to harm the nation. There is no separate criminal procedure code if you do a crime inside the university. So the statement that universities are a different universe does not hold. Every area of life is a different universe in a sense like hospitals, a factory, a movie theatre, a shopping mall and so on. This does not mean that a different rule should apply in case of criminal and anti national activities going on in these areas. A large majority of serious students will condemn the actions of these so called JNU student activists/ traitors against nation. The author is just trying to create confusion. As regards whether a criminal act was done or  not, it will be decided by courts. But to any sensible honourable member of public the kind sloganeering against motherland will boil the blood. Criminals must be punished proportionate to crime and by courts. Their white collar supporters must also be found and investigated. You cant have only demands from the system paid by tax payers. Any right must come with responsibility to the nation. It was clear that the behaviour of this group of so called students could not be called responsible towards the motherland.</comment>

<comment>It is difficult to deny that MOdi's intentions seem genuine but he is unable to control the elements in his party including members of his Cabinet as also associate orgainsations like ABVP.. It is unfortunate and the Home Minister was in a hurry to impute motives and even see Pakistan's hand with no proof. And the same MInistry despite inputs from the Intelligence allowed the Pathankot incident to escalate. It is becoming patent that Mr Modi is fighting a lonely battle with very poor support from senior members of his Cabinet from his No 2 and No 3 and others.</comment>

<comment>Sir you require both ..The good cop and the bad cop..To succeed</comment>

<comment>You are probably misguided!</comment>

<comment>PM made tall promises and in 2 years ,nothing has changed,except Millions of more promises.PDP a known anti India baiter sponsored anti India slogans in JNU, has helped the Govt to divert attention from Collapsing Re,Rising food prices,Rise in willful defaulters and Farmer suicides.That the slogans calling for division of India is clear misuse of freedom of speech and dissent.But to divert attention from failure to deliver will only add to rising risk of Economic chaos.As far as vigilantes in BJP go,its for the Leadership to decide how far they can be allowed to go.The only outcome is Nation suffers</comment>

<comment>How or what has this to do with Universities which are meant for higher studies and we the tax payers are paying 3 lacs per student to study but not spread terror on campus. Nation suffers when terrorists takes over universities in the name of freedom of speech and we pay subsidize their education where instead of getting educated they spread hatred against the same nation where they live. How ironic. And people like you who justifies their action are more responsible for the division of India in past and may be future. </comment>

<comment>Rahul Gandhi 'principal misleader' of Indian politics: BJP's MJ AkbarBy PTI | 16 Feb, 2016, 03:33 PM IST.NEW DELHI: Attacking  Rahul Gandhi who accused the ruling party of muzzling the youth,  BJP today called him a "principal misleader" of Indian politics and said it showed his "willingness" to "twist" the truth. Amidst the raging  JNU row, BJP also dismissed as "baseless and wrong" Gandhi's accusations that the party was muzzling the youth by branding them as "anti-nationals" and said the issue is not between the government and any institution but between the country and traitors."On the JNU incident, Rahul Gandhi had leveled some accusations against our party. They are baseless, wrong and ineffective. Rahul Gandhi instead of trying to be a leader has become a principal misleader of Indian politics. "His remarks in Assam over arrest of (JNU students' union leader) Kanhaiya Kumar is a proof of his willingness to twist the truth. Kanhaiya was arrested because of remarks and slogans which he raised which were anti-national," BJP national spokesperson  MJ Akbar said .Rahul who was in Assam yesterday had attacked  RSS and BJP over the JNU issue accusing it of muzzling the youth by branding them as "anti-nationals" and asserted that they will "stand up" and "challenge" them. Akbar said Rahul should read the Constitution where it is clearly written that the freedom of speech does not mean you will support secession. "You (Rahul) are saying the issue is of freedom of speech. I request him to read the Constitution. It has been clearly written that freedom of speech does not mean you will support secession. And there cannot be a greater secessionist slogan than this," he said. Akbar also said that Kanhaiya had given another "small alibi" speech and Gandhi was trying to confuse it. "This issue here is not between the government and students or government or any institution. This is an issue between the country and traitors," he asserted.</comment>

<comment>I stand corrected. Earlier I had presumed, JNU students would know the spelling for "witch hunt"."Unconditional release of   President Kanhaiya". Later insert JNUSU in small letters in banner. May be, expectation of any responsibility from these students is wrong.First, it was protest. Now, protest against reaction towards protest. What next? I do understand, Delhi is Kejriwal's Kingdom and these kids are the heirs. My condolences to Delhiites.(After posting it I noticed, the image at the title heading has been changed from students holding the banner. Why are you being so protective about students? </comment>

<comment>Bull shit.ABVP shouting anti-national slogans in ur imagination.Dont be an Alice in the Wonderland.It was leftist students who were shouting the  seditious slogans.If shouting 'Bharat Maata ki jai ' or singing 'Vande Mataram' is anti-national,then yes, they were anti-nationals</comment>

<comment>Ha ha! How many more days will you spread this lie?</comment>

<comment>Presstitution at highest point by Promod.  A vigilante for theLeft interests.</comment>

<comment>Who needs anti nationals when you have presstitudes like this author?</comment>

<comment>Very correct article. Modi is in the danger of losing his biggest vote bank - the first time young voters. Across all campuses, the ABVP is creating trouble and students are not going to like it. BJP is basically digging its own grave by behaving in such hyper-aggressive manner. As the saying goes - vinash kaale vipreet buddhi.</comment>

<comment>You all are astrologers and can predict anything in the name of freedom of speech. Can you predict when will Pakistan terrorist us again and people like you and Khujli and Congress will support the anti nationals. Common sense guys BJP is not a sychopancy party where the holy Nana becomes the first PM and then the holy Dadi the next PMand then the holy son becomes the next PM and then the barmaid Italian Spy wife of the holy son and mafia pontiff following Christian runs the country and now the idiot but holy son should be next PM.

<comment>"Vigilante-Rogues" is the epithet reserved for RSS, BJP and all patriotic forces.

<comment>Rising tide of anger yes.Its against BJP, the anti-nationals ,who are hell bent on igniting this nation on fire. BJP'S actions and policies so far are nothing but an attempt at self-immolation. They have set the country on the path of destruction. Nothing can stop this juggernaut. Enemy is within and ruling the nation. "Vinasha kaale vipareeta buddhi"</comment>

<comment>So you think Indians are idiots to actually believe that JNU students shouting anti national slogans are idealistic.</comment>

<comment>Was Afzal Guru your uncle? Was Ishrat Jahan your sister? Was Maqbool Bhatt your grandpa?</comment>

<comment>Yes, yes and yes. Just like you are my brother, they are all related to me. Everyone in my country is related to me. Indians are not idiots though the ruling party is thinking of them as idiots. Indian society is not as weak as you think. We need dissent, we need every kind of voice and opinion to foster in a healthy environment. That is democracy. That is the true nature of our nation.  That is what we pride ourselves about. Unity in diversity!!</comment>

<comment>Save your comment,it can be used as evidence against. And I mean it.LOL. So according to you it is ok for terrorists to kill innocents.It is equally ok to eulogize them.It is equally ok to raise slogans like," Barbaadi of India".How can you build the nation when you are siding with terrorist killing innocents?How can you build the nation & seek its destruction at the same time?Who said dissent is bad? There is Unity in Diversity ,nobody is disturbing that.</comment>

<comment>Tell me in a simple line how BJP is responsible for the morons shouting down down india in JNU...</comment>
