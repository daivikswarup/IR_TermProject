<comment>Whenever Rahul gets aggressive, Congress has faced debacle.</comment>

<comment>"Sonia, Rahul get aggressive in Parliament..." Wish you had shown same aggression in last 10 years to do something for welfare of common man, toh aaj ye din dekhane na padate. But you folks are so selfish that you never thought beyond your own family and now when it came to your existence toh gala faad ke chilla rahe ho? Were you deaf when thousands of people were crying at jantar mantar for Nirbhaya? Were you dumb when prices of essential commodities touched sky? Were you blind then when billions of rupees of honest tax payers were looted? At least now you should respect people's mandate and keep quite for next I don't know how many years.</comment>

<comment>open up all buried cases against italino...by the way, vel, there is something called rule and that is more than 55 MPs..because that is based on no. of strength of Lok sabha...or two parties must come together and tell speaker that we are one group and we are more than 55. The fact is no party is willing to join with pappu</comment>

<comment>Pappu showing agression????????????r that he is speaking the lines taught to him by his idiotic advisors!!!!!He,by himself is incapable  of even uttering a simple sentence, Mental Block.</comment>

<comment>RJ, in my opinion, the selection of the LoP itself maybe flawed.  Now,as the congress demands that it has got the second highest numbers of 44 seats, it has the right to be given the LoP.Lets assume that if two parties get the same number of seats ,say 44,and who should be allotted as LoP.And, hypotetically, assume we have opposition parties with seats 50 and 49. And, the 50 seats party gets LoP, but, if an MP demise, and the party looses the byelection. Now, what happens to LoP. Will it be redefined. Maybe some legal experts write a detailed view.</comment>

<comment>AIDMK and BJD should form a coalition and the entity may be given the Post of L.o.Pand blunt Congress with its own argument</comment>

<comment>WHAT EXTRA/UNIQUE ELIGIBILITY THE HUMILATING 44-SEAT CONGRESS PARTY HAS TO LAY CLAIM ON L.O.P. ?  Is it the Italian link ?  Or the people's mandate ?It can continue reminding Congress of its humiliating defeat and shrunk status in Parliament BY CLAIMING "AGGRESSIVELY" without eligibility.We will PIL if Congress is given LOP.</comment>

<comment>The ungratefulness of Indians is truly disgusting. Madam has given everything to this country and received nothing in return, and now the people expect to throw her out like used garbage. She has used her own money and own sweat and blood to make us the third largest economy in the world. What has the fascist Modi done except slaughter crores of innocent secular minorities like in the ghastly pogrom of 2002 in Gujarat?The very least we can do is allow Madam to lead the nation for the rest of her life as she sees fit. She has earned it, and deserves ownership of the country in perpetuity, as well as her descendents. Indians should give up this false notion that they are independent. Power is poison after all, as Madam has taught us.Forget leader of the opposition, Madam should be leading the country. You bloody Indians should know your place. Can I have my promotion now?</comment>

<comment>Fake Sanjay Jha's view is very sarcastic! Keep it up! Like this also  one can criticise corrupt Congress and its Queen </comment>

<comment>No Promotion until you say something equally servile about Rahulji Babaji also. Madamji and Rahulji Babaji are a Twin Delite ji.</comment>

<comment>Good one!</comment>

<comment>Madam was a con woman looting us all these years. Hence thrown out by people.  Are you congress?  </comment>

<comment>She built this country with her bare hands, even while heavily pregnant with Rahul. Without her and other Europeans you bloody Indians would be eating each other like savages. And being a barmaid is much better than selling tea in a train station.I really want that promotion.</comment>

<comment>This commetn should appear in Faking news as an article... its nicely written....not emant for firstpost perhaps.</comment>

<comment>Congress will now be workign on a LONG RANGE PLAN to revivew people's interest in congress party and itsideologies... ( not sure what they are other than sickularism)They have to plan to win the 2029 elections somehow....its a do or die battle for priyanka vadra gandhi.</comment>

<comment>Congress party in Karnataka has consistently found that Mallikarjuna Kharge is not competent to become the chief minister of the state,but yet he is now made the leader of Congress party in Lok Sabha.Only reason,Rahul Gandhi should be left to have all the time to go to Bangkok and Pataya frequently to release his sexual urge.Every action of Congress party is only for helping Sonia to make money or for unbridled enjoyment by that 44 year old Rahul Gandhi.</comment>

<comment>RG came forward thinking perhaps, they were distributing toffees and balloons?</comment>

<comment>lop is nothing, ...better wait for only 10 years and become ruling party</comment>

<comment>Our constituency allows some benefits for the Lop from theGovt funds... Like Cars, House, AC’s, free food for 3 times as so on..For gettingthese cheap things both are shouting…Nothing else...Don’t forget they never do anythingwithout anything in return...</comment>

<comment>Granting LOP for congress is against the rule book. Yet I have a feeling BJP is certainly gives away  not out of mercy but as survival strategy ... I scratch your back U scratch mine. During  Andhra state  bifurcation in LS, the bill was placed hurriedly incognito.  BJP Sr leaders commented  that they were not aware of bill tabled in LS, By afternoon BJP came out with full support of the bill without questioning whether it was introduced or not. Congress must have made some sort of truse with BJP. All this drama was live on TV</comment>

<comment>its a political tactic. running with the hare, hunting with the hounds.</comment>

<comment>BJP allowed the bifurcation because they knew it would come back to haunt congi dogs. Look how beautiful BJP's move was!</comment>

<comment>If BJP is sincere, committed and focused with real feelings of serving people the efforts will certainly pay off. BJP should not take people for a ride like congress did. Silently bringing held-ups in Iran  is a good starter and sign .</comment>

<comment>sorry  to correct you the people were held up in iraq and not iraq</comment>

<comment>SG and RG are mad they may have to give up some of the previliges they enjoy. Now it's begging/threatening time. Shameless italians. Kick them out. Hope atleast one congi dog has the spine to standup.</comment>

<comment>People of India are now all too familiar with Khongressi "Nautanki".Not that Maa-Beta didn't show aggression during campaigns but their aggression took the party total to all time low. The more they pretend to be aggressive the more they suffer. The days of Khongress are numbered and with that "Desh aur logon ke Achhe Din aa jaenge". Does anyone have any doubt about the real character of "The Lady of all sacrifice",her moron son and a national liability RaGa alias PappuG and the bunch of shameless stooges that they domesticated?</comment>

<comment>I read it somehere Sonia was new to politics. Later she became a victim of sycophancy and started enjoying the power and attention which have fallen into her lap without hardwork, sacrifieces , knowledge and intelligence. The power and pelf came to her only because of Gandhi tag. The sycophants for their survival made her bigger than life.  Any adharam will not last long... the result is congress was drubbed miraculously.</comment>

<comment>The curse of Telugu people has fallen on Congress like thunder bolt leading to miraculous debacle which may last for ages. Congress sinned in many ways.Hope BJP will not follow in the foot steps of earlier govt.  Ofcourse BJP appears to be more sincere and patriotic because of its nature and discipline. In fact Hindutva tag is mis created by Congress for self aggrandisement. BJP practically more secular than Congress. See the Muslims in Gujarat  how they are flourishing  in various fields during Modi,s tenure .</comment>

<comment>awsom</comment>

<comment>Arrogant congress treated people like dust. So the fall has begun. One of the greates sins they have committed was the division of 10 crore Telugu people at the instance of Sonia Gandhi who wanted make a political mileage . She might have acted upon wrong advise given by her advisers.</comment>

<comment>The charter of all parties is  the same ... be at the  service of people and country. When it comes to survival whether it is Congress , BJP or any other party they adopt different  means to stay put. May be AAP is sincere  and devoid of hunger power and pelf. It may also change its strategy for survival.</comment>

<comment>What was AAP's strategy during Lok Sabha elections? Did they spend all their enrgies and money equally in all 400 plus constituencies they stood for or mostly in Varansai?Talk with facts.</comment>

<comment>There so much of anger against Congress which is evident from these posts and posts posted in  other media sites. The entire nation and people  are terribly angry with Congress men for what they have done to the country. On top of it the congress keeps saying many good things we have done but  not been able to take these to people during elections.</comment>

<comment>the few good things they've done are Sanjay Jha, Digvijay Singh and Kapil Sibal, who ensured they were thrown out of power.</comment>

<comment>Sonia and Rahul deserve to be in Jail for spreading corruption in politics.</comment>

<comment>Why a natrional liabilty like SUPARI MONEY M is member of a party.This supari money has given very shame ful stament about their Leaders.</comment>

<comment>He stood in the aisle while the protests with slogan shouting against the Modi government continued. Some Congress men see this as the one defining moment for the party from Rahul Gandhi’s perspective.And folks this is what democracy has been brought to.</comment>

<comment>Dont forget the now ruling party have destroyed last 5  years of parliamnent</comment>

<comment>don't forget that the party claiming for LoP now has destroyed last 60 years of this nation.</comment>

<comment>cool story.. sadly just that.. a story. Whatever the BJP did, at the very least they did not stoop to the level of ignoring the people's mandate and demanding perks they werent entitled to. Learn to call a spade a spade.</comment>

<comment>If they had shown even a fraction of this aggression in last 10 years for public then our nation would have been in a better condition.</comment>

<comment>Shameful, beggars these Congis...</comment>

<comment>It is only a matter of time when Congress loses Rajya Sabha strength and BJP gains it.See in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chattisgarh, Delhi - they will replace Congress Rajya Sabha MPS with BJP MPS.After this year Maharshtra, Jharkhand, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir will again see Congress and its current/past allies get completely routed.Then it will be UP and Bihar - whose assemblies may be dissolved and after BJP comes their Rajya Sabha members will come and give BJP a simple majority in Rajya Sabha.Then Ma-Beta will become leader of a pack of street dogs.</comment>

Any way it does not matter any more, now that you have become wiser and praying to a new person. Keep it up.</comment>

You have given verdict to take some bold decisionsirrespective of how controversy it may be.Do not bother what sickular media writes about you or triesto defame, please bring that corrupt family to books. Please show that you arenot the same like others and people of India  will stand behind you.</comment>

<comment>The UPA government has frequently cited international commodity prices, and even money supply growth in India, as the reasons for high and persistent inflation. But as Bhalla's research establishes,high inflation in India cannot be attributed to these factors. High inflation in India owes largely to the "populist, Machiavellian re-election vote-bank policies of the Congress", particularly in the cynical manner in which it pushes up foodgrain procurement prices come election time.</comment>

<comment>There are no cleat cut guidelines about Leader of Opposition. But recently there are strong legislations on popular demand like Lokpal which requires LoP to implement it, to ensure transparency. So by implication there must be LoP irrespective of numbers. Again if we consider characters of opposition parties Congress has greater claim. If someone mocks Congress as regional party because of low seats then BJP is not different as in many states it has no presence.</comment>

<comment>alert: fake gandhi supporter spotted.</comment>

<comment>There is clear-cut guideline that any party claiming the post of Leader of Opposition should have at least 10% of the seats in the house. For the Parliament, that implies at least 55 seats out of 543. In 1984, Telugu Desam was the largest opposition party with 30 seats. They staked claim on Leader of Opposition post, which Congress party declined, because Telugu Desam did not have 10% seats in Lok Sabha.</comment>

<comment>Chidambaram has inflamed middle class feelings by claiming that they were perhaps protesting a little too much about inflation."When the urban middle class can buy a bottle of mineral water for Rs 15 and icecream for Rs 20, why do they make so much noise about rise of Re 1 in the price of wheat and rice?" Chidambaram wondered.He also suggested that the chattering classes should not complain about inflation because, in any case, the "poor farmers" were benefiting from higher foodgrain procurement prices."The rise has directly benefited farmers. There needn't be any complaint for price rise when things are on the side of poor farmers,"  Chidambaram said.</comment>

<comment>Prices are rising as poor affording to purchase vegetables: SibalIn an insensitive statement which seems like pouring salt on the wounds of the poor, Union Law Minister Kapil Sibal has said that price of vegetables has risen because the poor are able to purchase vegetables.According to reports, Siabal said on Thursday that those people of lowest strata of our society who used to eat one vegetable with chapatis are now now affording to eat two dishes of vegetables which is a reason for rising prices in the country.It is important to note that earlier, several senior Congress leaders like Rashid Masood and Raj Babbar had made similar in insensitive remarks denying price rise as an issue.Masood had said that one can get stomach full meal for just Rs 5 in Delhi whereas Babbar had said that one can get a thali of food for just Rs 12 in Mumbai.</comment>

<comment>Poor Congress let the election commission set another election whether or not to give LOP post to the congress/Sonia/Rahul or not? I bet they will loose miserably...... Poor</comment>

<comment>When BJP was in opposition it never allowed parliament to function by disrupting the proceedings. Then it had excellent speakers in Mr Advani, Mrs Sushma Swaraj, Mr Jaitley etc. But instead of high lighting govt failures, it kept on disrupt.  Now Congress party is paying in the same coin.  If price rises during UPA regime, then also it was anti people  and same rules applies to present regime as well and the present price rise can not be construed as in the interest of nation or enabling the railways to run just because now BJP is ruling.  BJP has come to power promising to bring down price including fuel price.</comment>

<comment>Yes..Agreed that still now newly formed Modi Govt. didn't made any such rapid changes or progress but only one and hand month is not enough time to judge anyone and his capability..Whereby Congress lead rule in India for more than 65 yrs since 1947 out of which the last 10 yrs of UPA rule under the same Sonia,Rahul Gandhi being the actual head of UPA Govt. and it was the most worst form of Cong lead rule as we all Indians witnessed..Wait a bit and give Modi's governing system time..Politics is no magic..</comment>

<comment>Vinaash kaale vipreet buddhi!! The mother-son duo trying to act smart. Looks like FP has still not learnt its lesson. Getting excited at petty things.</comment>

<comment>Worst Post will forever remain the worst of the lot of sick newspapers. They live on illicit loot stashed in Swiss accounts of the 4th richest politician of the world. If she farts, WorstPost will bathe in the "fragrance". These sick bas%ar&$ were deleting all anti-G family comments until 16th May. They haven't yet learnt their lesson. </comment>

<comment>Pardon me for my ignorance, but what is this 'Congress Party' that you keep talking about? Where is it being held? Is everyone invited? Is it a rave party? Is it some unholy party where an all-men group gets but-naked and engage each other in a drug-induced sexual 'congress'. Is that why it's called a 'Congress Party'?</comment>

<comment>This is called creating news out of nothing. So, the spoilt brat was getting everything served on his plate till date. Now that nobody cares, he has to get up from the seat and ask for it (there are still stooges who run for the service). And it becomes news?</comment>

<comment>Why chupendra modi bring Sonia, vadra to court? I think they have all the evidence of there crimes.</comment>

<comment>Tera kejru kyu g@@nd dabake baitha hai?yoya ka mu me le liye hai jabse scam khula hai</comment>

<comment>Over and misplaced aggressiveness is a sign of desperate nervousness!And only bootlickers will fail to see it!See how Secularist media including FP is joyed at the "Revival" of the Congress!!Yesterday Barkha was actually indirectly blaming BJP for the Op Leader issue!Remember how Priyanka got very agressive against Modi when he decided to campaign in the Nahru family den Amethi and put out a video on vadras scams?An aggressive Priyanka also said that the BJP were running around like 'agitated rats'.“Let them do what they want. I am not scared of them. I am not scared of anything,”  adding, “They (BJP) are acting like agitated rats. I knew they would resort to this during elections.”April 28 2014 zeenewsThis aggressiveness is because many swords are dangling above like the 2000 Crore Herald scam and Maa Beta know that unlike Vajpayee and Advani Mr.Modi is not going to appease the Queen.Remember how the Great Advani asked BJP MP's to apologise to Madam for their harsh comments against her,this- when she had called a BJP CM Modi maut Ka saudagar!Why was Advani so genorous to Sonia?Hope Mr.Modi does not make the same blunder which Vajpayee and Advani did!!</comment>

<comment>The way things are, no one can deny that we need a very strong opposition to keep a close vigil on the newly elected government because the signs have not  been very good so far. In the last 49 days we have seen overall increase in prices, railway fares have increased, communal clashes are erupting (Moradabad for example where people like Sangeet Som are roaming scott free), and scams are in making (for example, proposal to install X-ray machines at all railways stations). Compare this with 49 days of Kejriwal's rule in Delhi where he provided 700 liters of free water, reduced the electricity bills by 50%, transferred 800 corrupt officials, busted drugs and human trafficking rackets. Those 49 days are the real AACHE DIN people want. I think it is time Rahul to gear up and play the role of agile and vigilant opposition leader if he is serious about winning 2019 elections.</comment>

<comment>Dr.  Really. Hahahahahahahahaha.</comment>

<comment>signs have not been very good so far--->> because no subsidy has been given to you...this is why India will always remain poor...Muftkhori k din gye Dr..Saab..aur Kejru to Shaktiman hai jo sab free me bantega..paise ki machine to usne ghar me lagai hai..</comment>

<comment>Haha,keep living in your delusion,your waste bengol is full of shit,even a zoo will be a better place to live than that living under a crazy psycho</comment>

<comment>Save that aggression for defending yourself. Get an aggressive defense lawyer, like that loser from Chandni Chowk!</comment>

<comment>Walking down the aisle is "aggressive"?Why are they behaving like spoilt school kids?Sense of entitlement and absolutely no grace in defeat.The Govt with apx 350 seats ain't gonna bow to their tantrums, they will only watch with amusement the discomfort of the oppositionAnd media needs a reality checkInstead of focusing on success in Iraq it is following a non issue like this.Let the govt do it's job, don't look at everything with a microscope</comment>

<comment>Drama of corrupt MAA-BETA till CBI initiate corruption case for scams committed by them like Mulayam amd Mayawati</comment>

<comment>ENTITLED !!? All that the mother and son are entitled to is a couple of cells in the Tihar jail. The National Herald case is coming up for hearing within a month.</comment>

<comment>Two little mice getting agressive because they made money from National Herald deal. They should be put in a big mouse trap, i.e. Tihar Jail.</comment>
