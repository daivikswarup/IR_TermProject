<comment>AK has no money to pay workers but has waived off the electricity, telephone and water bills of Jumma masjid of Delhi which is approximately 10 crores. AAPtards want to consolidate secular votes to make khujli pm in 2019, AAP is the najayaz aulad of congress and there is no difference between the two !!</comment>

<comment>It is 2016 .. plp understand . what will happen at max .. complete power will come to AAP in next MCD elections .. very childish of bjp and congress not allowing AAP to govern delhi</comment>

<comment>AK-49 was heard crying "Modiji aap ko pata nahin main kis mitti se bana hoon ! " People of Delhi replied Abe AK-49 humein pata hain ki tum to Suver ki tatti se bana ho !</comment>

<comment>it is 2016 .. plp understand . what will happen at max .. Complete power will come to AAP in next MCD elections .. very childish of bjp and congress not allowing AAP to govern delhi</comment>

<comment>this is the real sentiment of people of delhi , am staying in delhi i know</comment>

<comment>AAPtards have lost the trust and credibility of the people of Delhi completely. Now no one listens to them. Their drama over 'fight against corruption' is similar to a pr@stitute fighting for virginity. Nobody cares a hoot for them, so wherever there is a news item aaptards quickly login and show their frustration on that forum making unverifiable baseless accusations against non AAPtards ! Earlier Delhiites used to say with pride 'paanch saal kejriwal', now after Kejriwal showed his true colours and betrayed them, they are saying ' l@-ude ka ball kejribal' !.-</comment>

<comment>No doubt Ak 49 won because of the fatwa of Imam bikhari of juma masjid delhi ! Ford foundation's has been blacklisted by Modi sarkar and black money of 400 crores that flowed for AAP funds since 2011 has been stopped, kejri's balls will be badly hit in 2019 as well as 2020 !!</comment>

<comment>Delhi CM  (Leader of B-Team) and A-Team leader are fast becoming like political jokers. So the C-Team leader (Nitish) has more chances for the post of next PM. Nitish plays the game very Meticulously in silence. He has all the Data Analytics IT experts to do a detailed exploration based on facts and insights.</comment>

<comment>By fresh elections does the author mean fresh assembly elections?</comment>

<comment>No, fresh MCD elections</comment>

<comment>Some of the blind supporters actually know how corrupt MCD and other BJP rulers are!!!But they support with the hope that they will also get some share of corruption money...!!For example:FeKhujili, Thomas M, Hindustani etc. etc.They have also joined strike, but active online posting and spreading lies,............all are waiting for January 2016 corruption share!!</comment>

<comment>Wow!! this is new low in the social media.... so you'd say 650+ cr spending on advertisement is fake? you'd say AK doesn't have a 7 series BMW or he doesn't have 70+ AC.. or he doesnt fly in private jet to Bangalore for his treatments using public money? or you'd say that he got delhi into 3000cr deficit is a lie or you'd say that school admissions are delayed due to his efforts?? Whats lie in these?? he has confessed to most of it.. why blame us if you got fooled!!Being a supporter is one thing but blaming everyone else for your misdeeds, greed, and anti public works now thats what AAP and its supporters are for!!</comment>

<comment>Yeah..For AAPtards everyone is Fake except their Fake Prophet Kejriwal!</comment>

<comment>I think...what BJP wants is a WHITEWASH defeat in all the state elections...Thats why they are doing drama everywhere in the country....!!!We will see soon: MCD, Punjab, Bengal...everywhere BJP will be cleaned up by public who earlier voted for them in loksabha...</comment>

<comment>Err...OK..good luck with that.Between Punjab and Bengal, BJP is not power so, I am not sure where your fantastic fantasy of white wash comes into picture!</comment>

<comment>But more than MODI, it is his party leaders, sanghu chellas and paid liar trolls..are responsible for their defeat!!!</comment>

<comment>When CM takes a private jet to Bangalore for his treatments, who do you think pays for him?? how else delhi got a 3000cr budget deficit within a year from surplus.. yet CM spends 650+Cr on advertisements and calls essentials payments like MCD as "Loan" and even then gives a meagre 500 Cr.. in short he wants people of delhi to suffer while he enjoys in bangalore, hyderbad, punjab etc on public money!!</comment>

<comment>Paisa kahan Dakar gaye? Bjp s MCD and aap ... Remember you came to power on corruption issue ...Let people check your accounts ... Phat gayi? ???</comment>

<comment>Hw does this keep coming bk again n again? More than once, since AAP came to power, MCD workers have needed to go on strike to get something as basic as their pay...while CM is in Bengaluru doing politics...no care for either these workers or the people of Delhi...only politics is paramount!! There is money for ADs, money for raising pay of MLAs, money for bureaucratic excess, etc but not for paying salary to an organisation which is controlled by BJP?</comment>

<comment>The cause of the strike is purely political. Ever since AAP govt under Kejriwal came to power, it has been satisfying itselection promises one by one. Free water, Electricity at half charge, Educational loans, Janlokpal Bill, Bus marshals, Constuction of Public toiets, Mohalla clinics, Poly clinics, Aam aadmi clinics, Free Medicines and free diagnosticservices in Government hospitals, Online issue of Certificates, Anti corruption helpline, E ration cards, E Riksha permits, stopping red beacon culture, Abolishing management quota and donation in Schools etc have already been done. Steps to make Delhi a wifi city, installing CCTV cameras,  reduce pollution, regularization of colonies. laying of pipe lines to areas without water connection are all underway. Flyovers are being constructed at hundreds of crores less than the estimated cost during rhe previous govt. People of Delhi are tasting the fruits of better civic services, concern for aam aadmi, better governance, responsive govt officials and more citizen friendly policies.  The odd-even formula has also been a resounding success due to the whole hearted participation of Delhites.It is  not surprising that BJP leaders have become completely frustrated over the rising popularity of Kejriwal and have been resorting to cheap and dirty tricks one after another to somehow show Kejriwal and AAP in bad light. For that BJP has been using paid media and paid trolls in full force against Kejriwal.It may be noted that the first anniversary of the AAP government falls on Feb. 14. BJP knows that on the occasionatleast some media will highlight all these achievements of the AAP govt.. If that happens BJP knows that the popularity of AAP will further rise not only in Delhi but also in many other states like Punjab in which election is due next year. So the plan of BJP is simple. Continue the MCD strike till the anniversary of AAP government is over. If they do that BJP thinks that it can mask all the achievements of the AAP government and make the media concentrate on only the strike and the Garbage crisis.</comment>

<comment>Delhi is going to become shining pearl of South Asia soon then.... Krezywal in the new messiah... Hail !</comment>

<comment>I am surprised that Courts are refusing to adjudicate  on the PIL on MCD strike issue immediately. MCD strike is a very serious issue, which may lead to another epidemic outbreak in Delhi.  The courts should have orderedimmediate withdrawal of the strike and ordered an enquiry into the funds and accounts of MCDs. Instead of settling the case immediately the courts seem to be callously enjoying the Garbage heaps on the streets. . Courts in India  have enough time to settle Ambani- brothers dispute within 6 months through special court hearing sessions, but doesnt have time to arbiter issues which directly affect the common man of the country. The deferring of the case by another 10 days shows the insensitivity of the judges towards the public and the judge seems to be giving sufficient time for BJP to flare up the matter further or keep it alive till the first anniversary day of AAP Govt.  These judges are making  a mockery of the  judicial system</comment>

<comment>Hypocracy and lies are the patented intellectual properties of Kejriwal and his AAPtards. He had promised on his children's head and swore that he will never take the support of congress and then made U turn, Lokpal bill and 400 page corruption documents against Shiela dikshit is buried deep under AAP office in Delhi. Jai ho ANNA Hazare !!</comment>

<comment>CBI is caged parrot, we should have investigation by FBI. Let the people of Delhi keep suffering ti;ll then.</comment>

<comment>A military probe should be instituted to find out who is lying ... AAP or MCD bjp ...Whoever is found guilty of siphoning off funds should be shot by shooting squads in public in broad daylight like rabid mad dogs ...Bjp and aap both had major issue with corruption ... Pre election ... Let's see if they agree now to this solution ...</comment>

<comment>This mess is creation of BJP government which is ruling in center as well ruling MCD. People of delhi understand what AK is doing and what Modi is doing , BJP has lost delhi & Bihar , soon they will out of power in Kashmir then they will loose Punjab. All these are tactics of BJP to divert attention on real issue , They have no intent to pass GST , export is plummeting , manufacturing sector is down, unrest in student , hardly any Job creation, BJP should look at real issue and should not torture people of state who have rejected them in election.</comment>

<comment>So, Delhi Govt does not have money to pay MCD, while they have money to raise advertising budget, give themselves 400% pay rises, pay PWD (which comes under Delhi govt), etc etc But haan galti BJP ki hain! :P</comment>

<comment>Why your BJP leaders have pocketed all the money MCD were given???Now 551 crores of loan...that also you want to put in your pocket??????Kitna scam karoge BJP walo??????</comment>

<comment>we know how AK fought election agasinst Sheela dixit govt... 370 page proof... remember..if he is so sure about corruption...Why he is not filling FIR or recommending a CBI proof.. </comment>

<comment>I don't know about Modi's administrative skills, but BJP many supporters are just liars..</comment>

<comment>I agree , irony is Modi supporters are doing really doing harm to him.</comment>

<comment>This is as true as you said previously that an AAP MLA was supporting a rapist of a child.  From where did you learn that the AAP MLA was supporting the rapist?  Liars...</comment>

<comment>Hypocracy and lies are the patented intellectual properties of Kejriwal and his AAPtards.

Jai ho ANNA Hazare !</comment>

<comment>But well, almost 2 years are up after occupying Parliament.  Still, there is no conviction in 2G scam, Coal Gate, Robert Vadra illegal land deals, Sonia Gandhi, etc..Khejriwal's plight is that even for getting a rapist of a child arrested by Delhi Police, AAP MLAs have to resort to dharna.  AAP has no authority over even a police constable.  But BJP has so many Law Enforcement Agencies like CBI, CID, NIA, and what not?Who is making the U-turn decide yourself.....</comment>

<comment>Thomas M is a BJP appointed crook...He will tell what his leaders have asked him to tell?He is basically deaf and dumb...only keeps on repetiting lies!!!</comment>

<comment>In 2g Raja was arrested and court proceedings are happening in other cases, CBI questioned MM Singh in coal scam, Haryana govt has ordered enquiry into vadra's case. Keep following the news, Khujli has never uttered a single word against Sonia Pariwar till now. Kejriwal is like a castrated dog, he has no balls to talk about Malda riots, ISIS, corruption of Sonia Pariwar, went to Dadri to consolidate secular vote bank, 400 page corruption document against Sheila Dikshit is buried along with Lokpal bill under the AAP office !--` When asked about Pathankot attacks, Malda riots, ISIS he replied saying that he would not comment on happenings outside Delhi and he is the CM of Delhi ! And now to Hyderabad asking PM to resign !</comment>

<comment>WHERE DID YOU GET THE NEWS THAT AAP MLA WAS SUPPORTING RAPIST?</comment>

<comment>Internet, Google and news !</comment>

<comment>Thomas M --> BJP appointed LIAR</comment>

<comment>even God cant help this Modi bhakta..</comment>

<comment>Then you are not good at reading and understanding English.  Please go and read the same again and this time without prejudice.  I am not against any party but corruption and lies.</comment>

<comment>No doubt Ak 49 won because of the fatwa of Imam bikhari of juma masjid delhi ! Ford foundation's has been blacklisted by Modi sarkar and black money of 400 crores that flowed for AAP funds since 2011 has been stopped, kejri's dream will be badly hit in 2019 as well as 2020 !</comment>

<comment>How much money they spent to get the MCD election win?  That will give the answers.  Article is written using Smart English Grammar so as to put the onus on the now CM, whereas the issue is longstanding and if so then BJP has a greater role in the mess, and accordingly BJP in center should act properly.  Else, it will backfire BJP royally...</comment>

<comment>This First post is news portal of Relaince . They are always ready to malign AAP or AK . Just notice this paid article , and paid BJPigs to comment under this article , this article written with an intention to make public view as kejriwal is behind all these mess , where as we all know the loot being conducted by BJP in MCD since last fifteen years . they are doing lakhs and lakhs of corruption day and night . and now to creat mess in delhi they are not paying salary to staff and creating impression with this kind of paid  journalist and paid shamless BJP bhaktas that Kejriwal is responsible for all this . Boss this is your old tactics which failed you in Bihar and delhi , now wait for punjab</comment>

<comment>AAP's Vikaspuri MLA Mahinder Yadav was arrested on Friday under various charges including rioting and assaulting public servant during a protest against the arrest of an alleged sexual offender, the sixth lawmaker from the ruling party in Delhi to be arrested. He was supporting the rapist of the 3 year old baby !</comment>

<comment>Rapist must be a muslim...Otherwise AAP does not make so much noise!</comment>

<comment>One bhakth lies and the other supports.. wah re wah....  Before endorsing anyone's comments please do not just check which party he is supporting but see what truth he is saying!  or else you will also be liar....</comment>

<comment>Only AAPtards are allowed to lie??? many can play this game</comment>

<comment>Why does he every time end up in bangalore, whenever there is problem of salary for MCD workers ?</comment>

<comment>Ak wants to hide his face after betraying the delhi people's trust !</comment>

<comment>Just like Modi goes to foreign betraying people's trust who thought that he will convict the 2G scam, coal gate scam, Robert Vadra illegal land dealings, Sonia Maino, etc...</comment>

<comment>Well, sonia was dragged to court along with her son and you AAP supporters started screaming that it is political vendetta and supported their congi comrades ! AAPtards are blind bhakts of khujli baba !</comment>

<comment>One of my colleagues who boasted that he can carry even HIMALAYAs on his head. So we were impressed. When the time came, he told us - first you must lift the mountain and then keep it on my head because i can't bend.AK49 is far worse. He weeps that others are not carrying the mountain for him.Mockery of democracyNautanki camera clown. Pathetic scumbag. How people of Delhi going to tolerate this mentally unstable person for another 4 years..God save us.  People of Delhi has to pay for voting him and for his natak.They have voted him with thumping majority even after knowing his natak for 20 days.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, unlike hero Modi ji who has made sure that the culprits of 2G scam, coal gate, Robert Vadra for illegal land dealings, are all behind the bars...  And yes black money has come back to the exchequer.  That too within 2 years of coming to power...</comment>

<comment>Govt says it already paid salary but BJP/MCD says it hasn't been paid and refuses to divulge its account books. And delhi govt cant directly pay the workers.It is clearly indicating BJP playing dirty politics here. They know people will blame Kejriwal as he is CM but most of people don't care how much fund has been given to BJP controlled MCD.</comment>

<comment>But,why is Kejriwal chilling in Bangalore when the whole city he is CM for is rotting in garbage?And why is it that Kejriwal always will be on some kind of Yoga camp whenever his party faces some problems?</comment>

<comment>OMG look what this champooo is saying , look you morn MCD belongs to BJP ...you BJPig ask your masters to pay the looted amount , You bjpigs got tight slap in Delhi and  bihar jus becaouse of playing this type of cheap politics . BJP will be wiped out in coming all elections thats for sure . Only AAP is the ray of hope for this Nation .</comment>

<comment>Jaana bey Paki.Hahahaha.</comment>

<comment>Anyone who speaks against Modi should go to Pakistan?  This is going to defeat you royally...  Remember you are not gaining anything by saying this but just showing off your foolishness.</comment>

<comment>No,you are butting into others' conversation and in the milieu are risking being called a moron.Now,please kindly mind your own business.I have nothing against you.Look at his comment how he abused me which prompted me to just scoff at him because I dont want to waste my time by replying to such inane nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Blow to AAP govt.नर्सरी एडमिशन को लेकर हाई कोर्ट ने दिल्ली सरकार के मैनेजमेंट कोटा खत्म करने के आदेश पर रोक लगा दी है. कोर्ट ने कहा है कि सरकार ने 2007 के अपने खुद के नोटिफिकेशन का उल्लंघन किया है. सरकार ने बिना किसी पॉवर के 6 जनवरी का आदेश जारी किया. सरकार स्कूलों की ऑटोनोमी को नहीं छीन सकती है. इस आदेश के बाद नर्सरी एडमिशन को लेकर प्राइवेट स्कूलों को हाई कोर्ट से बड़ी राहत मिल गई है. फिलहाल प्राइवेट स्कूलों का मैनेजमेंट कोटा बरकरार रहेगा.</comment>

<comment>People at least now know good intention of Kejriwal after it. So it's blow to Delhi people and yes to Govt as well.</comment>

<comment>This is lession for AAP, who normally take decision unconstitutionally. Like transfer of IAS/govt officers, stopage of salary for govt officers ,even knowing they are not authorise to do</comment>

<comment>What lesson you are speaking BJP got hell lot of lessons in Bihar and Delhi elections , BJP is fitting there paid judges in court , they are making all kind of favourable decision . and this every body knows .</comment>

<comment>Come on, BJP has done so many things in 2 years.  All the 2G scam, coal gate scam, Robert Vadra illegal land deals, Sonia Maino, are all in jail...Even a convicted criminal Lalu Prasad is out of jail in Modi ji's Free India...</comment>

<comment>absolutly</comment>

<comment>AAP does not have any Shame..neither does Kejru..Waiting on Nalayak Kejru will now blame Judges accusing them of Modi's Agents!</comment>

<comment>And Modi is proud that he has convicted all culprits of 2G scam, coal gate, Robert Vadra for illegal land dealings, Sonia Maino...  and also for bringing back the black money to the exchequer..Khejriwal has not even a police constable under is jurisdiction.Modi has CBI, CID, NIA, etc..</comment>

<comment>I think MODI is getting his share of corrupt money from Vadra and all..so not running any cases.Wherever not getting money, he is asking CBI to file chargesheet..haha</comment>

<comment>Congress+BJP's Bhai Bhai Councillors are stakeholders of MCD. Even, 90% portion of Indian GDP will not sufficient to feed them. Everyone who lives in Delhi know the corruption level in MCD, except Blind BJP supporters.</comment>

<comment>Some of the blind supporters actually know how corrupt MCD and other BJP rulers are!!!But they support with the hope that they will also get some share of corruption money...!!For example:KeKhujili, Thomas M, Hindustani etc. etc.They all are waiting for January 2016 corruption share!!</comment>

<comment>If AK is"Honest"to his words then He should recommend CBI Inquiry into MCD Corruption. Its his Job to Recommend. But instead of filing FIR and recommending CBI probe.. he n his party doing Drama... cheap politics..</comment>

<comment>Yeah..Why do we need MCD..After 1 year Khujili and his useless MLA's are finally working cleaning garbage....The only work they are fit for!</comment>

<comment>yehh pls include 3 more useless MLA's also</comment>

<comment>They are not on streets cleaning garbage..Please check your facts!</comment>

<comment>I know they are good for nothing.</comment>

<comment>May be..But Khujili and his MLA's are only good for cleaning garbage..;)</comment>

<comment>At least they are try to handle the situation, unlike BJP congi jokers who R always busy in POLITICS</comment>

<comment>If they are handling it, why do they need MCD employees?Let them continue...at least this way they are doing some work!</comment>

<comment>Whom to blame!Govt says it already paid salary but BJP/MCD says it hasn't been paid and refuses to divulge its account books. And delhi govt cant directly pay the workers.It is clearly indicating BJP playing dirty politics here. They know people will blame Kejriwal as he is CM but most of people don't care how much fund has been given to BJP controlled MCD.</comment>

<comment>If it is true then Delhi Govt must drag MCD to Court. Let the truth come out</comment>

<comment>It's the MCD that has dragged Kejru to court.Hearing is on 10th..so, please hold your testicles AAPtards..</comment>

<comment>Desperate Bhakt calm down ! Abhi bahut bure din dekhne hai tum logo ko</comment>

<comment>Agreed..Khujili Bhakths must calm down...Punjab will show Khujili his real aukath..</comment>

<comment>Delhi govt. owes 3000 crores to MCD.. Kejriwal himself has agreed that the VAT collection was short by 3000 crores than what was expected..I think Delhi govt. has no money to pay the MCD.. They must seek centre’s help for fund..</comment>

<comment>Delhi people are getting free daily serial soap from Kejru..They are entertained and are not complaining.Many of them feel the nautanki by Khujili is much much better than Ekta Kapoor serials!</comment>

<comment>But the people who didnt vote for Kejriwal are getting punished for their counterparts' mistakes.</comment>

<comment>Necessary sacrifice..Kejru will make sure Delhi will give BJP 7/7 MP seats again :)As much as I would like BJP in Delhi state, people learning the truth about this idiot is way better..</comment>

<comment>That is not my point.Take out the semi-state status of Delhi and make it part of a state or make it a UT again.Also,shift the Central govt and other govt departments from Delhi to some secure place where people are more polite.</comment>

<comment>That could work...Would love nothing more than to shift the capital to Nagpur..The sickulars, pressstitutes and AAPtards will have collective heart attacks :D:D</comment>

<comment>Yes,that would be funny.In fact,in this age of IT and communications,having a centralised govt with offices in a single city is bizarre.Shift them to places where they need them the most and equip them with state of the art communication technology and digitise every service given by the govt.Then,people wouldnt care where the govt office is as they can do every work sitting at home via internet.</comment>

<comment>Reporter to AK: Sir, what are your plans for valentines day? Are you going to do something special for your wife?AK: I want to but Centre is not helping me.Reporter: Sir, usko Centre nahin Laura kehte hain</comment>

<comment>LMAO..</comment>

<comment>Only solution is to dissolve AAP govt in Delhi and hold fresh elections!</comment>

<comment>Keep dreaming </comment>

<comment>That is what AAP needs.. No more chance for them to escape this time.. They should be allowed to rule till 2020.. Let us respect people's mandate :lol</comment>

<comment>true, but what if he wins again.. isn't there anyway his party be declared ban and debarred from  contesting election?? this kejriwal thing is real pain in delhi.</comment>

<comment>If he wins again, we can finally show middle finger to Delhi people and tell them to fark themselves ;)</comment>

<comment>what if he wins from punjab too, god help this country</comment>

<comment>Won't happen.Delhi they won because Congress Strategically shifted their votes to AAP to defeat BJP.In Punjab, Congress is on strong wicket.It would be a 3 way or 4 way battle.In 3 way battle, no one will get majority...AAP + Congrees will probably tie up..But if it is a 4 way with BJP coming out of alliance with having 'understanding' with Akalis, AAP is pretty much screwed!</comment>

<comment>thank you so much, these days m having AAPTARDS nightmare.</comment>

<comment>Just because he is CM of Delhi does not make him special.Their are other CM;s like Naveen Pattanayak, Chouhan, etc who manage more complex states still remain out of controversies.After all Delhi is just a small state why pay attention to him?</comment>

<comment>The author has cleverly made a case for re-election of MCDs. But dear Author, it is a poor logic given by Delhi CM and propagated by people like you. If this logic is applied pan-India, every incumbent central government will starve the states ruled by opposition parties and then ask for re-election. Nothing short of Nonsense. Delhi CM should understand that taxes being collected by Delhi government belong to Delhi people and not AAP. The civic amenities and the services being rendered by MCDs to Delhi people have to be paid by taxes collected by both Delhi government and MCD instead of the MCD only approach of the CM & Dy.CM. Delhi government will have to make adequate budgetary arrangements for civic amenities instead of exorbitant and highly disproportionate allocation on advertisements.</comment>

<comment>JUST BUNCH OF LIES IN DELHI... AND PRAISING ONE MAN AKWORLD CLASS CITY- NOW KACHRA CLASS CITYBEFORE ELCTION- WE WILL make PERMANENT TEACHERS/DOCTORBUT NOW NO SALARY..AAP KI SARKAR, KACHRA DILLI KE DWAR, AK mitti se nahin soover ki tatti se bana bana hua admi !</comment>

<comment>MCD mess??? Sir MCD did not have any issues with Sheila's govt for last 10 years... why sudden problems when AAPTARDS came to power>>>>.. If AK49 has guts, ask him to prove all his allegations in the court..</comment>

<comment>If an organisation is primarily responsible for looking after the civic amenities in a city and it fails at its job due to the its own financial crisis that it has not been able to solve, shouldn't that organisation be questioned? The MCDs in Delhi have been under financial crunch since the times of Shiela Dikshit. The Delhi government (previous and current) has given assistance to the MCD from time to time. Doesn't this show that the officials at the corporation had not planned their finances properly? Labeling the entire matter as a "battle of egos" appears to be an attempt to dissuade people from looking into the minute details about the financial irregularities of the corporation.</comment>

<comment>Delhi govt is not doing any favor on MCD by giving their share in taxes.Moreover.Center managing DPLG managing DDAMCD managing civic amenities.what kejri and his 67 MLA will do then? apart from creating rukus ofcourse</comment>

<comment>What?U are forgetting my tours to Dadri, Mumbai, Hyderabad and weekly trips to Bangalore..I am very busy man and don't have time for stupid Delhi people..</comment>

<comment>Kejri is typical delhiwala. No remorse. No sense of responsibility.So many ppl died because of dengue, So many ppls life under threat due to garbage.But he is happy to play politics over the issue.as if he is doing summer job and he has no resposibility towards ppl of delhi</comment>

<comment>People of Delhi deserve what they are passing through. Greedy people got cunning leader.</comment>

<comment>if any body challenges or even intends to debate corruption in the Delhi MCD's or even DDA then there is something really wrong with him.</comment>

<comment>The picture captures the parasite kejriwal, as it really is - a glowering parasite out to grab power at any cost and by doing one drama after another..guess it is finger pointing time for kejriwal again..but dear kejriwal, are you planning to accept responsibility for anything at all, ever? Guess pointing fingers is a full time task for a cm..pfft</comment>

<comment>just love the posturing by FP authors...especially when it is to take on AAP.... notice how quiet about the lacks of progress on pathankot or sundry stuff on the govt ....</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal have been doing Drama so far. What Kejriwal did in Bangalore ,could have been done few month back. n FYI Its the responsibility of Delhi Govt to pay.</comment>

<comment>typical aaptard response.My courruption is better than yours stuff</comment>

<comment>ooh..typical sangi...calls names when cornered without answering the issue....</comment>

<comment>true this AAptards sing the same song of corruption, we are more interested in mandir and these foolish aaptards talk about corruption, kjhujliwal is real pain in delhi</comment>

<comment>whenever AAP leaders are in fault they just give example of some unrelated event or start abusing modi. why dont they come clear on their stand against courruption. Why manish fakodia VAT scam is not geeting their attention.</comment>

<comment>you are talking non-sense do you know that. look at you alias, it reflects your ideology and approach towards the country</comment>

<comment>It is in the national interest to hold the elections in Delhi MCD. MCD money are being used by corrupt BJP. They know they can't win again so they are looting as much as they could.</comment>

<comment>Dont' know whether there is corruption in MCDs. I presume it must be there as it is in every sphere of India including Delhi government. But what to do with institutionalized legalized corruption like increase in advertisement budget from 24 Cr. to 526 Cr. just to polish personal image of Mr. AK and make him a competitor to Mr. Modi. By your logic his government also must be sacked and re-election be ordered immediately.If there is corruption in MCD, expose it and take legal action. Who's stopping? You cannot hold funds on the pretext of a perception of corruption. Taxes collected by Delhi government belong to Delhi people and not AAP and the same must be used for providing civic amenities to Delhi people instead of image building.</comment>

<comment>avatar mcd dues have to be disbursed by DDA which is controlled by LG. And we all know who's chamcha is LG and why this garbage crisis is created. DDA has already recieved the funds for salary payments. Why isn't it being disbursed by LG sahab? Its simple. Your feku wants people to think kejriwal is withholding dues, but let me remind you that the people of delhi are not blind and not without reason did kejriwal win 67 seats in the delhi assembly.</comment>

<comment>lol just let them have an election for both MCD and delhi govt together and we will know the result</comment>

<comment>yes people of India should be provided with a chance to undo their mistakes on the national level and then see the result.</comment>

<comment>this is for delhi , aaap hole turd  ( sickular xtian) not for india , india barring delhi is cleaner than delhi result an aap chute with aapturds gong bersekk</comment>

<comment>save least 3 seats that BJP has.</comment>

<comment>lol , u are a sickular chute mate , u are out of touch with realities read live mint news portal and see khujli's ratings as CM while delhi stinks ,</comment>

<comment>why? who are you to ask them not to get extinct? it is their prerogative to commit political suicide.</comment>

<comment>and also club the centre govt. elections alongwith. let the people decide.</comment>

<comment>kejri lost against Modi. Now what do you want elections every week till kejri wins.</comment>

<comment>If BJP cannot pay to their employees then there is no point for them to continue. Corporations are purchasing Audi cars for their Councillors at the cost of payment of salaries to the workers </comment>

<comment>why should BJP pay the delhi govt employees , its delhi government's duty to pay their employees</comment>

<comment>Then why MCD is protesting? Government itself can pay then, why should Kejriwal send to MCD and then MCD has to pay salalry?</comment>

<comment>the MCD is protesting because aap holes like you are using the roads and not paying it for the maintenance, which is one by  aam humans  , khujli is not paying the 3000 crores due to it  ( he already spent 526 in his self grandiosement ) for paying the aam aadmi , he got a raise of 400% for himself to watch movies and write reviews no money for the MCD workers , he has money for his massages and subsequent attack on Tanzanians by the sickular gang ( is Bharti still in delhi ) but no money for the MCD . he wants to audit the money not sent by him lol now he should know the CAG is auditing him</comment>

<comment>Don't...Who is begging Khujili to pay..He could have waited for courts order on 10th..No one forced the Feku Khujili to release any funds..</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>no Municipality comes under central govt , it is the responsibility of the state govt here aap hole ruled ones which should provide for the MCD workers ,. let him forgo the sales tax and excise tax of delhi , then MCD will try to get it from centre . centre does not rule delhi , only aap turds and they are going to do the impossible now that is  spread dengue and zika in delhi so their ilk ( microcephaly - meaning brainless can increase ) , enjoy delhiites - u will soon be a extinct like the black rhinoceros , thanks to aap</comment>

<comment>You dumb wit. Does every corporation comes under central govt? Does Mumbai CORPORATION receive funds from Delhi or Maharashtra Govt. ?Every corporation of every state receives funds from that state.Similarly MCD's receive funds from Delhi govt. No wonder dumb wits like you voted khujliwal.</comment>

<comment>who is asking BJP to pay Delhi govt. employees. are you really hard on understanding the thing at first go?</comment>

<comment>MCD should only pay their own employees. That is enough.</comment>

<comment>The only permanent solution is to dissolve MCDs and hold fresh elections so that Delhi people can install AAP government in MCDs with overwhelming majority.</comment>

<comment>Laluji, you are a chameleon par excellence.</comment>

<comment>Good to see you disciple after a long time...</comment>

<comment>first decide what is right and what is wrong. your inability to do makes you laughable.</comment>

<comment>and do what after that , beg centre for money lol , read the news properly brainless AH</comment>

<comment>I think you uploaded the message without completing it...What do you meant by "AH"? Did you mean "Ahmed"? I am not a Muslim by the way.</comment>

<comment>u are the limit of brainlessness , maybe pappu in this forum , ( i meant the real pappu ) u @$$ H0*E</comment>

<comment>No doubt Ak 49 won because of the fatwa of Imam bikhari of juma masjid delhi ! Ford foundation's has been blacklisted by Modi sarkar and black money of 400 crores that flowed for AAP funds since 2011 has been stopped, kejri's dream will be badly hit in 2019 as well as 2020 !</comment>

<comment>AK-49 was heard crying "Modiji aap ko pata nahin main kis mitti se bana hoon ! " People of Delhi replied Abe AK-49 humein pata hain ki tum to Suver ki tatti se bana ho !</comment>

<comment>CM of half a state Delhi is the pre$$titute media's favourite. There are CMs of big states, very hard working and coming up with innovative ideas like Devendra Fadnavis of Maharashtra, Biju Patnaik, Shivraj Singh, Raman Singh, Vasundhara Raje, Raghubar Das, Tripura and Pondicherry CMS, CHandra babu naidu, Goa cm, Gujarat and haryana CMs but the sold out 89% corrupt media ignore them and highlight the only scheme till now -odd even rule which will fail as everyone will purchase and have an odd and even number vehicle at home. Delhi is just half a state and its CM thinks that the tail can wag and control the dog !. People of India are shocked how the Indian media selectively censors good work of Modi and highlights Khujli !--</comment>

<comment>Media. Specially NDTV will be soon getting treatment by intolerant public</comment>

<comment>AAP's Vikaspuri MLA Mahinder Yadav was arrested on Friday under various charges including rioting and assaulting public servant during a protest against the arrest of an alleged sexual offender, the sixth lawmaker from the ruling party in Delhi to be arrested. He was supporting the rapist of the 3 year old baby !</comment>

<comment>APtards have lost the trust and credibility of the people of Delhi completely. Now no one listens to them. Their drama over 'fight against corruption' is similar to a pr@stitute fighting for virginity. Nobody cares a hoot for them, so wherever there is a news item aaptards quickly login and show their frustration on that forum making unverifiable baseless accusations against non AAPtards ! Earlier Delhiites used to say with pride 'paanch saal kejriwal', now after Kejriwal showed his true colours and betrayed them, they are saying ' l@-ude ka ball kejribal' !.-</comment>

<comment>AAPtards want to consolidate secular votes to make khujli pm in 2019, AAP is the najayaz aulad of congress and there is no difference between the two !</comment>

<comment>1. MCD's told HC they have paid salary till Dec. 2015. Then why their workers began strike on Jan 27 - even before next pay period completion?2. What steps did MCD take to recover their 1500 crore from DDA?3. Why is MCD refusing an audit of its balance sheet by Govt? They want more money but zero accountability.4. Where did the money given by Delhi Govt for salary go?</comment>

<comment>1. MCD's told HC they have paid salary till Dec. 2015. Then why their workers began strike on Jan 27 - even before next pay period completion?- MCD paid salaries after kejri paid dues two days back. Secular media not telling you the truth.2. What steps did MCD take to recover their 1500 crore from DDA?- Why should they recover it, its delhi gov responsibility.3. Why is MCD refusing an audit of its balance sheet by Govt? They want more money but zero accountability.- MCD get audited regularly by CAG, they are ready to audit by delhi gov. But they also want to audit delhi gov. But manish fekodia is scared because of VAS scam4. Where did the money given by Delhi Govt for salary go?- it is gone in paying salary till diwali.get your facts right. you are aaptard not a degenrated zombie</comment>

<comment>1. Wrong. MCD's told courts on Feb. 2. Kejriwal gave 550 crore loan on Feb 3.2. Wrong again. DDA comes under LG. Unless you think like LG who said I am the Govt.3. MCD have consistently refused to get audited by Delhi Govt. CAG has never done FINANCIAL audit of MCD's. Who is stopping BJP to get expose any AAP scam, you have CBI, police, ACB everything. BJP tried with CBI raid and came with big ZERO.4. Delhi Govt paid its full dues for the financial year. How much corruption occurred in MCD that it was spent in  7-8 months?Getting facts right is not the forte of NaMorons, fake nationalists and Andh-Bhakts. Mandir wahi banayenge - tarik nahi batayenge. Mandir banane ka 1000 Crore chanda kha jayenge.</comment>

<comment>Rather than spreading lies why dont you give feedback to kejri.tell him following"we are with you for nobel cause and not to pamper your ego.TIll date your achievment is negligible and how long are we going to defend your inefficinecies? bhakts are making fun out of us everyday since you took office"I helped you. Please post it on internal jokepal</comment>

<comment>It's unbelievable that the MCD has not been audited for a long time now. Where's the accountability from the BJP with public funds here? </comment>

<comment>lols , when they are not able to pay salaries due to non clearance of dues from Delhi govt what are they going to find by auditing , is it a similar gimmick like auditing the discoms</comment>

<comment>Auditing means that we need to know where all the money went. Just saying... </comment>

<comment>when the money has not come in at all what will u audit , if money had come in they would have paid salaries isn't it</comment>

<comment>but first where is the money sent by khujli is a moot question , u cannot audit if you have not sent</comment>

<comment>Why does Kejru goes somewhere else? There are many places where he find problems. Go to Bangalore or Kerala, The problem with Kejriwal is he can not clean his rear end.</comment>

<comment>see khujli was in bangaleru and what we get a racial attack , not sure if Bharti was there with khujli</comment>

<comment>Sadly our PM was not here in India for last two years..</comment>

<comment>jUST BUNCH OF LIES IN DELHI... AND PRAISING ONE MAN AKWORLD CLASS CITY- NOW KACHRA CLASS CITYBEFORE ELCTION- WE WILL PERMANENT TEACHERS/DOCTORBUT NOW NO SALARY..AAP KI SARKAR, KACHRA DILLI KE DWAR</comment>
