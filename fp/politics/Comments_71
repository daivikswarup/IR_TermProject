<comment>The writer has been tried to safeguard the Left very much, U didnt even know what realy happened in panchayath election,Not a single hindu vote has been flown out of congress to CPIM, The truth is Notable share of Hindu votes(Nair votes from Congress and Ezava Votes from CPIM) has been flowed out to the BJP and thats the reason why Vote share of BJP increased,usualy when BJP's vote share increases CPIM was affected but this time the damage has been covered by Muslim votes from Congress due to their self created communal problems and placing them as the only one who opposses RSS,They reached to that extent so that they teased every hindu beliefs to make minorities happy and thereby woo their votes,Unfortunately they succeeded and they split a considerable share of traditional muslim voters of Congress and thats why they got more number of seats,so please dont come to a conclusion that only Congress votes split and flew to BJP,the truth is ezava votes split btw CPIM & BJP and Muslim Votes Split btw Congress and CPIM , Nair Votes stayed with BJP Christian votes stayed with Congress</comment>

<comment>Go Kerala Go. This time BJP. 3 Trivandrum seats are sure seats</comment>

<comment>Ego clash and internal fight started in BJP KL. Hope they won't fetch any seats.</comment>

<comment>its headed my Kummanam & coordinated by RSS,U cannot even satisfy ur own mind by raising such childish arguments</comment>

<comment>The RSS has the highest number of shakas in Kerala, which is of course  a small state ,but has unfortunately not been able to convert it to votes for the BJP. The problem the RSS faces in Kerala is that the Muslims and Christians, unlike the rest of India, happens to be highly  educated and well off and they have a wonderful equation with all the communities ,the social fabric is strong and it is hard to polarise society.Well played out and brilliantly used trump cards in other parts of India like the Mughal invasion  and forced conversion is unfortunately not something people in Kerala fall for  as Islam happens to be in Kerala centuries  before the Mughals , taking a dig at Urdu doesn't work because everybody speaks a single language . Beef politics which has been brilliantly and successfully used in rest of India is not something that works either because everybody eats beef .History of Moplah riots could have been effective and potential weapon but many Keralites  also see it as a rebellion by peasants against upper caste land lords and their atrocities .If partition  and Jinnah could have been used as a bait in other parts it is an absolute no no in Kerala as Kerala Muslims and the Muslim league strongly opposed partition .RSS should innovate and work on Kerala with a different approach. Comparatively things are moving in the right direction and there has been progress in their hard work, there are more divisions today and communities hate each other more than they ever did in the last 40 years.It is very important that they keep up that momentum and also find new innovative ideas .</comment>

<comment>Kerala RSS was far better than any other states. KL BJP leaders eat beef and they are not against beef. KL BJP and RSS became violent after Modi and Amit Shah's visits. Greedy Feku want to get seats in KL to fulfill his Corporate Bosses agenda,.</comment>

<comment>Adaniji has already acquired a port in Kerala and hopefully will flourish more.</comment>

<comment>Hindus were never tolerant by choice , but by force - Jinnha[ If they were tolerant .. how then Pet animals (like cow) were treated better than shudaras ]They became tolerant not by choice but due to the Shamsheer of Muslims and Gun's of Europeans...............</comment>

<comment>ya, right, the same "shamsheer" that caused mohammad ghauri to be defeated 7 times by prithviraj and the same "shamsheer" that lead to Pakistan being broken into two in 1971. Keep dreaming Mr Arab Forgery.</comment>

<comment>kerala bihar and tripura have one thing in common zero job creation the past 3 yrs </comment>

<comment>UP haryana MP - have in common - full bribe - full corruption at govt offices - full riots for caste religion - full illiterates - full female foeticide - full caste/religion thinking - low education/medical facility index - low human dev index etc etc</comment>

<comment>some time back the short creepy  useless home minister of kerala ramesh chenathala went on record to say that he was ashamed to be  hindu nair recently there was a picture of this man trying to sneak inside the nss head quarters</comment>

<comment>Caste system should be abolished, it is not there in the Vedic culture. All Hindus should unite together and vote strategically to keep congress and communists out of power. Then only will Hindus be taken seriously. Nowhere else are the majority community ridiculed and ignored as in India. The leaders of various castes should realise that united they will be strong.</comment>

<comment>Kerala people should throw away every old party and should vote for an open minded party. When neighboring states like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are progressing rapidly in industrial front Kerala is still stuck in the 20th Century.</comment>

<comment>Despite the Hindus being 54% of the population why Muslims and Christians ruling Kerala? They should throw out the govt  which indulges in minority appeasement at their cost.</comment>

<comment>Hindus should stop deluding themselves about "Secularism". Its just a tool to re-colonize them.</comment>

<comment>KL Hindus use their brains and they are not violent fools like you.</comment>

<comment>The only violent fools in Kerala are the Muslims and Christians. Hindus are secular and that is why they have been tolerating the hegemony of the two. But time now has come to throw this yoke of servitude and assert their rightful place in the politics of the state. Wake up Hindus.</comment>

<comment>Here in KL we respect our Hindu brothers too.. The only people we don't gave respect is Few Fake Hindus from RSS and BJP. Even i have many RSS / BJP friends but thy never created any violence or hatred so far. Hindus, Christians and Muslims are equal in KL except for few fools.</comment>

<comment>not at all , look at the number of hindu ministers in this govt , which was involved neck deep in sleaze,  solar scam and bar scams . this shows a blatant tilt by a sickular xtian chancy towards fellow xtians and that is minority appeasement</comment>

<comment>Hindus of Kerala do not need your respect. What they need is a fair share of power in the state. If the BJP people are fake Hindus. you too are a fake and second hand Christian.</comment>

<comment>You Cow Belt Gaddhe.. We keralites know how to handle issues of our state.. You go and milk cow and clean cow dung. Lot of Hindu ministers are already there in cabinet. Our opposition is Hindu majority. We don't need Cow Belt guys advice.</comment>

<comment>Suwar, the truth has bitten you. Kerala Hindus iss baar phadenge tumhari.</comment>

<comment>ha ha..rajput ki jaliiii....mughalo se itna gussa kyun..ha haha</comment>

<comment>Stupid gadhe, I am not a rajput.</comment>

<comment>India must follow Swami Vivekananda teaching to make India a better country in the world! Great son of India!</comment>

<comment>What is the meaning of appeasement politics? What has been done in India that has favored a particular group of people.Kerala is at the epitome of development index today. The development in Kerala is spread across more evenly instead of creating a few Adanis while the Narmada project affected people beg around in Gujarat.  And, BJP has never ruled Kerala.Hope Keralites have the wisdom to see the bad effects of BJP rule across India (stock market crash, spike in price of basic products, controversy in premier educational institutions, etc.)</comment>

<comment>Oh Poor, Adani is building a port in Trivandrum on the express invitation of Congress. Looks like you are talking about the happenings of 1980s.</comment>

<comment>Adani can build many ports. But, the ports have to generate revenue for the government  and that revenue has to be used for the people. And, that never happens with BJP.</comment>

<comment>Adani building a port has nothing to do with development in Kerala or the matter being discussed. What is being discussed is that, in Kerala, the people are treated better than Gujarat.For instance,  In Kerala, you do not see a Narmada bachao Andolan because no Kerala politician is stupid to build a dam without ensuring protection of the people who stay on the banks of the flood and lose their land.</comment>

<comment>hahahahaha. Then dear sir, why are the kerala young population mostly work outside the state? Even keraliites will be laughing at your post.</comment>

<comment>Because Kerala young population wants more money. Thousands of North Indians are going to Kerala because of the high wages and the great facilities for the poor in Kerala.</comment>

<comment>if you know someone from Kerala, please talk to them and they will tell you that north-Indians have been flocking to Kerala. The reason is that in Kerala, the minimum wage is Rs. 300. If Keralites go out of Kerala, it is because they want better salary than that available in Kerala.On the other hand, I do not know of a single Gujarati who works in Gujarat. Either they come to Mumbai or get out of India.</comment>

<comment>Attributing the stock market crash to bad governance shows your poor knowlede of basic economics.Surprise surprise..you want to shy away from controversies. For your information premier government funded universities have through the decades indulged in various controversies be it pro right groups or leftist orgs or whatever. JNU for example is a hot bed for promoting anti national and seccessionist ideologes. Yesterdays horrendous anti India protest march and pro Afzal Guru event was just an example of that.Its good that it came out in the news because people now can see how well their tax money is being spent.Development in Kerala is a rotten joke. And if I try to argue this with you, you will throw me the age old literacy rate numbers and whatever. Kerala runs on NRI money and rabid corruption across all levels of infratructure. Chandy's corruption charges is just one example.No state has this much people wanting to leave than Kerala. Now that the booze has gone..they flock to nearby places mainly Bangalore to have some sense of a normal life. Strikes and bandhs are so rampant you would be surprised if you went through a day where people clock 8 hours work to the minimum.This is development ?Sure Kerala hasnt grown Adanis and Ambanis. They have their own. Yusuf Ali, the Varkeys..all making money off shore and they arent even Indian anymore</comment>

<comment>UP haryana MP - have in common - full bribe - full corruption at govt offices - full riots for caste religion - full illiterates - full female foeticide - full caste/religion thinking - low education/medical facility index - low human dev index etc etc----</comment>

<comment>Monkeys jump around. When we talk about Kerala, the monkey jumps to MP and UP. When we talk about progress, Monkey jumps from Kerala all the way to Africa. Its very difficult to have a rational discussion with those jump around without knowing any facts.</comment>

<comment>monkey tere abba..</comment>

<comment>Kya Katli tu idhar bhi??</comment>

<comment>Is this a debate about Kerala vs the rest of India? For your information Kerala is not the best state there is, and neither it is the worst. Karnataka, a non BJP state for example has better work and life conditions than Kerala in my book. People have a future in this state. People from Kerala look to leave to find their future. This was my point.Talk about Kerala, because that is what this debate is all about.</comment>

<comment>lol..go and check the various indexes of a state in india..and u will find which states r at the top...!!!! keralites r not settling outisde rather they contribute to indian economy hugely by sending in those foreign money..lol..every school kid in india knows this fact...</comment>

<comment>various indices?? what abt industry and agriculture...dont bluff here..every school kid knows HDI is not due to the idiotic govts that has screwed the state post independence</comment>

<comment>check in which state, organic farming takes place d most..kidoo have lolipop</comment>

<comment>took this much time to google it out bachhi...now try fooling other that organic farming takes place only in kerala..its self sufficient..doesnt depend on TN and other states for its food to mouth existence...</comment>

<comment>Yes.. KL leads in organic farming in India. CPIM party itself promotes and maintains a number of organic farms in KL.</comment>

<comment>haha..now kido, go and check india's largest IT park in area in india.. u will understand things...</comment>

<comment>largest IT park means topping industrial chart...arrey pappu bhi yeh sab nahin bolthe tu tho usse bhi bada gaddha nikla</comment>

<comment>pappu and mujhse bhi zzyada bada gadha h beta.. pata h kaun , jaa apne ghar jaakr dekh</comment>

<comment>Tera baap hahahaha Gadhe ne chinaal ko janma</comment>

<comment>bachhi tere pappa pappu tujhe bahut kuch sikhaa diya hain...teri maa aur mausi aaye the mere ghar pe..dekhne ko mila do bade gaddhon ko..laath maarke bhej diya hain...jaakey gnd maraa</comment>

<comment>India's first IT park is Technopark of Trivandrum and Communist leader EK Nayanar is the man behind it. He brought IT park idea to INDIA. Infopark of Kochi and Technopark of Trivandrum is still growing.</comment>

<comment>Come and visit KL villages and towns.. We have every basic facility within 3 - 5 Km range.. Almost every house own alteast 1 or 2 cars + Bikes. Lot of migrant Bengalis, Assamese, Tamils, Jharkhand , ranchi, bihar and people from other part of India is working in Kerala. Even labourers own two wheelers for commuting.</comment>

<comment>so does tht mean in industry and agriculture Kerala is topping the chart..those ppl are commuting in 2 wheelers because keralites do slavery in ME...3-5 km range..as if Kerala is as big as MP</comment>

<comment>Who is doing slavery? LULU group the biggest in Middle East is owned by a Malayali.. He is providing lot of Jobs to Kerallites in his businesses, RP Group another big firm in Middle east owned by another Malayali, like that many big establishments are there in Middle east by malayalees.. Only very few work as slaves not all. Who all are working they are getting nice pay package and all  Sheiks and Kings of middle east give special preference to People of KL.</comment>

<comment>Stupid gadhe, nobody but a citizen by birth can own a business company in any of the ME countries. Stop spreading your foolishness.</comment>

<comment>in ME every Asian is a salve no matter what u own?? u r at their mercy unlike ppl from west...u may not have had a stint there..thts the reason why u r creating these logic to fool others...anyways u still run away from queries on industry and agriculture??</comment>

<comment>KL IT Industry is growing and Organic farming got very good popularity in recent years. Congress + CPIM is promoting this in many villages.</comment>

<comment>Industry means IT only for u...sorry..no point...even Keralites run their comps in TN</comment>

<comment>A lot of small and large scale industries are already running in KL. Check for the facts and then blabber. If you are from TN ask TN labourers and business men about KL job opportunities and Pay.</comment>

<comment>so u admit no major industries r there...even if we go by ur bluff small scale industries r there it wud have been in the top half when it comes to industrial growth...the reason why u run away when asked abt industrial and agriculture is because of this...Ppl from ur state say the labourers snatches more wages because of the militant trade unions ruled by goons a.k.a commies...even they lck from the migrant labourers wages and feed their families....Businessmen from other states stops short of pukng when they say abt KL..u will not know since u spend time hallucinating....keep bluffing and changing ur names..thts the the only thing that u are good at</comment>

<comment>Human indexes yes, check the economic indices and it is a different story for a state like Kerala. Remittance is a fact which I have stated hundreds of times in this blog. Kerala runs on NRI money. You mentioned 2 contradictory facts - 1. keralites are not settling abroad. 2. they contribute by remitting money back. How does one work without the other????People who leave Kerala for the Gulf work hard and make money for themselves, keralites unlike their political support group aren't socialist. They are highly capitalist and very enterprising like the Gujarati's. Business is profession for them and they are really good at it. But sadly, there are no business opportunities within Kerala because of  yours truly communist policies. That is why they leave. And that was my point.</comment>

<comment>haha..these are all 10-20 yrs back story...go and check wht is vizhinjam port , what is technopark, wht is lulu mall , check the medical/education facility level , check d infant mortality rate, check the avg life span of a human...so many bro so many...i am from UP though but i luv kerala</comment>

<comment>You were the one complained about Adani and here you are proud about the Vizhinjam port which is being constructed by the same Adani.Whats your point.</comment>

<comment>Ask any Migrant Labourers in Kerala whether they have Jobs or not in KL? They are getting 3x times better wages than any other Indian states.</comment>

<comment>Have you gone just to our neighbor Tamilnadu?. The wages for Migrants are same in Kerala and Tamil nadu. If its 3 times, then the whole migrants will be in Kerala.</comment>

<comment>There are controversies because the BJP and bhakts create them. India was always a country with multiple points of view and everyone (including the people who opposed the freedom fight) were carried along.JNU has been in existence for years but there were no issues till BJP/ABVP decided to create issues.US embassy in Mumbai has a Gujarati (not Hindi) counter. That should tell you how much the Gujarat economy is dependent on dollars and Gujjus fleeing Gujarat. Yet, Kerala is a lot higher on the development index.Everything is dependent on governance. Refer he Internet for Modi's comments regarding the exchange rate and attributing it to UPA. Now that BJP is in power, stock market crash has nothing to do with governance.And, the crash is not just in stock market. My hike (in percent) this year will surely be lower than the hikes I received every year from 2094 to 2014.</comment>

<comment>You people create controversies. When right winged groups begin influencing and opposing decades of leftism that has been embedded in our institutions, it becomes a controversy ? Dont they have freedom to oppose ?Do you think the average person of India wants to see students shouting anti India slogans in our nations capital ? Is this why JNU gets funded ? On the barb of a cultural event those cowardly students mock the country whose citizenship they claim. Well they have a right to do it and we have a right to oppose it. Dont make it a controversy if ideas such as this start to get opposed. For 50 odd years there has been socialist and leftist leanings in all forms of government infrastructure. Now there is a pro right and pro capitalistic shift. Its basic democratic principles which you lot seem always to cite whenever the going gets tough.You again probably havent been to Kerala. Kerala survives solely on NRIs..they have few industires to speak of barring rubber tourism and a bit of agriculture that gets exported.The infrastructure is pathetic..the govt run universities are born lazy and dont work..its Soviet era all over again with Unions and Unions and Unions and everyone fighting each other.I presume you work for a private company ?. I hope you have the good sense to realize that a low hike this year is not because of the BJP government but because of your companys poor performance over the years.Forget Modi..talk about economics. Analyze the past weeks stock market fluctuations and tell me how did government policy influence any of that ? The factors contributing to the Sensex are innumerous and blaming any government for its crash is just stupid. Sorry but it is.</comment>

<comment>Kerala has one of the best tourism-related industry in India. I have been to Kerala multiple times and know that Kerala has affordable schools, affordable hospitals, affordable housing for all, affordable basic necessities.Indian companies/market are in the dumps because their earnings are low. Indian banks are in the dumps because the corporates do not have money to repay loans and many loans are becoming NPA.Regarding anti-India-ism, was RSS' opposition to freedom fight anti-national? Should RSS have been banned by Nehru because RSS was anti-national? With a rigid attitude where people are compartmentalised, India will not survive as a country because there are too many differences within India. The government must take everyone along. Also, many Indians in England/Australia support India in a game against England/Australia. Should England/Australia kick all of them out? Who decides what is anti-India? Are the people who opposed the freedom fight really competent enough to pass judgement on what is anti-India?</comment>

<comment>please tell me were are you employed in india,s so called developed state of kerala or in mumbai bangalore chennai delhi or in the arabian deserts or african countries</comment>

<comment>My spouse was employed in Kerala, though not me. But, that has nothing to do with this discussion.</comment>

<comment>Mad house ... Swamy Vivekanandas definition still holds good ...</comment>

<comment>Disgusting. The only way Congress and Left know to rule is by pitching one religion against the other and sow seeds of insurgency and wear this false veneer of secularism and tolerance.</comment>

<comment>It is time for Hindus to unite consolidate and break the vicious stronghold of the three evils of India , communists, islamists, and Christian missionaries.</comment>

<comment>islam is the biggest sin and we should jpin forces with christians aholes to kill them</comment>

<comment>On ODD-EVEN farce ==>LMAO..... This circus show has no end....and i sympathize with the vast amount of vacuum found in the heads of Delhites( They should rather use that space for parking their vehicles ) as they are so easily fooled by this fraud , incompetent and corrupt party i.e pAAP , thanks to the immense support it receives from media which facilitates them to spread blatant lies...This scheme was never intended to reduce pollution or bring any positive change in the same but was an outright stunt to dupe mindless galoots of Delhi...As pAAP have nothin' concrete to show in form of body of work and among all the charges of corruption and misgovernance which were piling up against them , they invented this scheme to work as a tranquillizer and face saver for them. And with rapid circulation of falsehoods they claimed that this fraudulent SCHEME WAS A HIT.....Rofl.. now lemme burst their bubble >>>>The pollution level have remain unchanged if not marginally increased..> Common man is suffering immense torture due to rising load in the metros and other congested space in public transports..>Auto mafia are having honeymoon as they're extorting and blackmailing passengers to pay double the usual amount...> Common man is being intimidated and hassled through large sums as a penalty , just coz he chooses to use his vehicle to commute for even the most urgent of needs like hospital , office and schools...> Humongous corruption being carried out in form of the Auto permit scam..But media by repeating 24 x 7 a lie for thousand times are trying their best to make masses believe that this stupid , worthless time -waster is some kind of a boon....Is it a rocket science that if you will ban vehicles automatically traffic will get reduced...thats not a solution but a glaring example of misgovernance...what next ? ban on youth filing for job applications , so that unemployment rates can be brought down ?</comment>

<comment>Only thing sickular bstrds have to say abt Kerala is HDI which is by no means achievements of these political governments post independence...the HDI is so high that they have 12th std pass as ministers in Govt..these bstrds are mocking ministers in other Govts..ask them abt industrial and agricultural growth in Kerala....and u can see "facts" getting dished out</comment>

<comment>फक the congress party, they've joined hands with IUML चूतियास।</comment>

<comment>it shows again and again that congressis are demonstrably intolerant toward the hindus.</comment>

<comment>So is Pappu right after all - the Congress is defeating the Congress in Kerala indeed !! Jai Ho Pappu.</comment>

<comment>With the kind of resourced kerala has, The malayali especially malayali Hindus do not deserve rape and slavey in middle-east.</comment>

<comment>w/o industry and agriculture no resource can be of any use....so go to ME and get fcked</comment>

<comment>You are right on these points.</comment>

<comment>Outsiders like you are not properly aware of KL lifestyle... Kerala ranks top not only in literacy but also in overall standard of living. HDI is high in KL than any other BJP governed states of India. BJP shits want to get some seats for that they are creating un necessary hatred and violence under the guidance of Amit shah ad feku.</comment>

<comment>What HDI? you are prostituting your women all over the middle east and boast of? instead of being ashamed; any way a poor hard working laborer is more respectable to me then a high class prostitute, but its all about your values.</comment>

<comment>Azz burned? Apply burnol.. I bet you are from a low class family. Wht value you are talking about you arse hole? </comment>

<comment>Its a tragedy that prostitution has come to be recognized as High class Job in kerala but why?</comment>

<comment>Arse hole... Moron go ffukk your mom and sis.. Go and do some low class job like your pimp dad and mom.</comment>

<comment>As your name suggest U R Christian; that means that you indeed believe that you are a result of either "Son fucking mother" or "Brother fucking Sister" or  "Father fucking Daughter" that is how according to you  whole human race has come about so go forth and ask forgiveness for you incestuous being from me.</comment>

<comment>see that communal thug..when no answer he gets very tolerant...bstrd got really screwed up</comment>

<comment>Kerala has become hot bed of Islamic terrorism and human trafficking; it is up to Hindu community of kerala; if they want freedom and dignity or rape and slavery in Arabia</comment>

<comment>Chaddi Jihadi like you are spreading violence and hatred in KL and I pray that people like you should die with your family soon.</comment>

<comment>ur chaddiless vatican master is good at eliminating own family members....it will be easier for u to replicate that art with ur family...if possible ur whole community</comment>

<comment>Enough of your blabbering</comment>

<comment>bjp shud try to win 20 seats.........they shud bring ezhavas and nairs together, many dalits are hindus as well once consolidation happen things will start ticking by itself......ezhavas esp its section thiyyas were rulers of soil, nairs were aborigines of mahyapradesh, vidharba who mixed with scythias and brahmins to  became ruling elite by 15th century..there is a tension between these two groups , it should be resolved ,dalits  pulayas too will go fr bjp after achuthananthan</comment>

<comment>minorities just vote on religion in kerala , else shashi tharoor shud hv lost elections  in loksabha...btw chandy is another abhisex singhvi , these congies prey on women enterpreunars to give liscences, sex addikct and trafficking cabinet with minority appeasement........achuthananthan is way better leader , but communist bas%% high command likes prinayi vijayan ........</comment>

<comment>Kerala is another of those highly fraudulent states.</comment>

<comment>Congratulations to BJP in advance</comment>

<comment>They can celebrate CPIM victory with crackers.. Like Bihar...</comment>

<comment>kerala is dead</comment>

<comment>Let Bihar repeat in Kerala.</comment>

<comment>How nice.. congress is loosing one state at a time, slowly and steadily.. they must realize their politics is not of secularism but that of appeasement which can only work in short term. Without any ideology or ethics they will continue to loose more states.</comment>

<comment>And so they dream....</comment>

<comment>Listen...... Emperor Babur here..... You are all brothers. You all have Muslim blood from my, Babur's soldiers who grabbed and raped short and dark Hindu Dravidian women in 1526 and after. The women were given to women-starved Mughul soldiers as a de-minimis perk and the women were screaming like Azam Khan's buffaloes until the Hindu cows came home...... Do not fight... you are cousins with the same ancestors..</comment>

<comment>LOL! All brothers?  Muslims started killing each other on the deathbed of Muhammad (irrespective of their relationships) they what is the message? by the way most of the Mugal price chopped the head of their father and brother, but you are the true example of what comes out of rapine.</comment>

<comment>Get back to work you miserable Hindu slaves.... I am watching from the heavens..... The Taj Mahal and the following majestic Mughul monuments must be clean every day... I do not want it to look like the dirty and filthy Varanasi or the dilapidated lousy Ram Mandir buried under the rubble.... STOP TALKING--------------------------(1)	Humayun's Tomb(2)	Lahore Fort(3)	Taj Mahal(4)	Red Fort(5)	Shalimar Gardens(6)	Jama Masjid(7)	Badshahi Mosque(8)	Fatehpur Sikri(9)	Sikandara(10)	Agra Fort(11)	Bulund Darwaza(12)	Itmad-ud-daula’s tomb(13)	Qutub Minar</comment>

<comment>It is good that Muslims never ask for wisdom in their prayers for fools are the happiest lot. so be Happy!</comment>

<comment>Did it ever occur to you that Emperor Babur might be a satirical account?</comment>

<comment>My dear people of Kerala... KL was peaceful than any other states of India..Don't let this BJP goons spoil our harmony.</comment>

<comment>Kerala is full of communist goons and no industry survives in the state.</comment>

<comment>Most of the menfolk work outside Kerala,They just go once or twice in a year,hence it is peaceful.But not a single Malyali asks congress and communists dumb wits a simple question-------If Malyalis work hard in other states why are they not working in their own state?????</comment>

<comment>Kerala has highly educated workforce, not like BIMRAO states. There are not enough opportunities in the state (land is scarce, wages higher, communist policies don't help either), and also they have excellent network overseas, through which getting employment is easier.</comment>

<comment>dont dish out lies..its only because of the political environment industries are not getting setup...shutdowns and lockouts dont happen due to land scarcity..even public sector infra projects are opposed tooth and nail...overseas network connections are there for many other states due to which they become employers and not just employees...dont gloat on tht front</comment>

<comment>And don't be sexist, moth men and women work outside. They are employable, and get employed.</comment>

<comment>M.P. is BJP ruled state and very peaceful since BJP is ruling it.  Good development work has made people elect them 3 times in succession. Do not be biased by the BJP haters.</comment>

<comment>Depends on what you call as "development" - if you look at human capital index, Kerala is first and MP is a far distant 20th.</comment>

<comment>Add Chattisgarh too</comment>

<comment>Kerala should remain a Sanghi Free State....</comment>

<comment>Sanghis have been bad mouthed by Congress but are a very disciplined cadre, have been at forefront in relief work everywhere when needed, have never killed or massacred people, and therefore Congress speaks bad about it always.</comment>

<comment>Even Kerala Sanghis where peaceful and tolerant until this Feku and Amit Shah started involving in Kerala Politics. These two morons involvement started to create hatred and violence in Kerala.</comment>

<comment>Hindu vote consolidation sunn ke ye convert ki bhot jal rahi hai hahahaha</comment>

<comment>I am not sure who is frothing hatred here!!!</comment>

<comment>In Kerala..Problem is not with Christians..but Terrorist Mullahs. we need to sack them out to GULF.</comment>

<comment>In Kerala we don't have any problem with Hindus, Muslims or Christians.. BJP is the universal problem of India and Kerala.. Kerala ranks top in communal harmony. BJP is trying to destroy Kerala's communal harmony.</comment>

<comment>There is communal harmony because Christians and Muslims have more rights than Hindus in Kerala.  Kerala has become a completely failed state regarding industrialization.  Its educational standards are extremely low even though its literacy rates are high.</comment>

<comment>Communal harmony in Kerala means converting poor Hindus to Christians and for Muslims terrorizing kaffirs.  But if Hindus unite they will be labled communal.</comment>

<comment>Do.nt spin tales, hand of a Professor were chopped off in Kerala for asking a question about prophet Mohd.</comment>

<comment>Muslim consolidation is fine.  Christian consolidation is the norm. B.J.P consolidation is communal. These are the ways of vote politics.</comment>

<comment>Violence more common' in Bible than Quran, text analysis reveals - headlines in TOI , hindus choose wisely -</comment>

<comment>the problem is in kerala all hindus are leftist and all other are communal,until these leftist hindus dont choose to respond to muslims and christian communalism kerala will always be a  sorry state</comment>

<comment>In Kerala most Muslims & Christians are communal and they vote only for their own religious Muslim or christian candidates of  UDF or LDF respectively.  Hindus are divided on caste lines. BJP will have a chance only if hindus united in Kerala. Communists who born in hindu family r not really hindus..they have no religion. If hindus do not unit in Kerala one day Kerala will be another Islamic state.. like syria.</comment>

<comment>No other country in the world had given 'minority' status based on religion. It is either ethnicty/skin color.... I'm a Hindu so I'm not entilted for minority benifits but if I change my religon tomorrw....alas i'm minority and can take up benifits....this is a $hitty system...</comment>

<comment>S(rew you God, sorry sorry that is blaspheme, but most of us are really pissed of with you, because you gave human beings a brain which only knows to divide themselves based on colour, race, creed, religion, caste, money and what not and did you leave your brains behind when you created us and distributed brains, especially creating unique specimens like AK the anarchist & narcissist, Modi the fascist & narcissist and especially the jacka$$, sycophant  clown Rahul along with other politicians..</comment>

<comment>Guess you have a solution mr screw</comment>

<comment>Ya man, believe in your faith and god but shun blind beliefs, treat everyone equally and follow the path of humanity  and public good, hope Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones of Men In Black come along zapp every bodies memory and install a meaning full version of the memory.</comment>

<comment>Kerala political landscape is like USA..in Kerala,  power changes between UDF  & LDF , like in USA it changes between  Democrats  & Republicans. but in Kerala, the change happens every 5 years...this has assured both fronts that whatever they do or don't do,  they can't  go beyond 5 years...into this,  comes the BJP by snatching the votes of various Hindu groups which were so far split between the  LDF & UDF..this will really upset the political equilibrium in the state and even though the BJP may not be able to win the seats, they will surely upset the calculations of both  Marxist and Congress fronts.  So far  these parties took their votes for granted, but now onwards,  they will value their votes......in Kerala, 1000 votes can change the results in many assembly constituencies as both fronts are neck and neck at most places, except in Malappuram district where the Muslim League candidates win by huge margins. The swing of  such small amount of votes is giving nightmares to both congress and marxists in the state....this is good in many ways and will force the big political parties not to ignore the Hindu community voters.</comment>

<comment>Why has BJP never won any assembly or Lok Sabha seats in Kerala despite the RSS having the maximum number of shakas there?</comment>

<comment>If all the parties cast their votes for their own candidates, then BJP would have already won a seat in Kerala assembly...BJP has numerial majority in atleast couple of seats in the state ,  but the LDF led by marxist party is dead against seeing any BJP MLA in Kerala assembly, so they swing some party votes for the congress candidates and ensure their victory..this is an open secret every one in the state knows..</comment>

<comment>Why has no mullah been arrested despite being rapis*s?</comment>

<comment>why has your dad not been castrated for giving birth to a moron like you?</comment>

<comment>Haha mullah spotted</comment>

<comment>these communist and Congressis are the reason , that so many extremists and terrorists are coming from the land of GOD...just Vote bank Politics...even you know this.</comment>

<comment>Why you communists are not winning any elections outside Kerala and West Bengal. They were once a formidable force in all the Indian states.But BJP  going up from 6.6% --> 11.4% --> 16.6%</comment>

<comment>He is Mohammed not communist.. Far worse</comment>

<comment>1 Kerala has 56% Hindus, 26% Muslims and around 18% Christians.2 Muslims: It can be safely said, the Muslims are not going to vote for BJP given the activities of the Sangh in the Northern states.3 Hindus: The Hindus can be divided to 3 main categories:SC/ST/Dalits: They generally vote red because of the land rights they received due to the reforms initiated in the 50s. The Northern districts are generally communist bastions as they have a significant tribal and dalit population.OBCs: The Ezhava community is the most populous among this. The BJP has been trying to woo this community to vote for them. Consequently the SNDP (a social organization for Ezhavas) has decided to enter politics. But the level of acceptance among the populace remains a question mark. Also majority of the Ezhavas eat beef as well so it will be another obstacle for the BJP.Upper Castes: Nairs are the majority here. However, the upper castes do not have such a disproportionate clout over the politics in Kerala. Again, many Nairs also consume beef. The perception of the BJP as being anti beef is entrenched in Kerala. It will be hard to shake off. The vegetarian Brahmins constitute less than 3% of the population.4 Christians: They generally go for the Congress or the Communists depending on their economic status.no local BJP leaders to counter local stalwarts like VS, Ommen Chandy, Pinarayi Vijayan etc.</comment>

<comment>sorry man all statistics will prove wrong this time don't underestimate the silence of Hindus and think that as your advantage</comment>

<comment>keep dreaming like bihar</comment>

<comment>Or life like aisha of her husband</comment>

<comment>You keep calculating like 2014... haahaaa :)</comment>

<comment>Modi was here, he was speaking in Hindi, an unacceptable language in Kerala, no one except one handful of Hindu activists invited him to be in Kerala with a crowd funded by Rs 30 Beef Biriyani(ironically) and some of the Hindu activists were even sleeping on the Modi stage, there are videos doing the rounds all over youtube.And over that, Modi has mentioned, Paap se Mukti milenge(or something like that).Really?We would like him and all bharatis to eat nice Kerala beef and partake in our celebratory Papams and nothing more.Dont come here for votes.</comment>

<comment>You say modi was 'Here'..so you are a mallu nuzzie.. The worst kind</comment>

<comment>cant u make out from this pg's "tolerance" that he is from terrorist own country?? he is a pucca communal pgshit</comment>

<comment>like guj anar and hardik</comment>

<comment>yes in in jail, try planting more such guys and land up in jail or get the anti national tag for life time free</comment>

<comment>Modi is not only anevent manager but also an event creater. His whole energy is directed at creating talking-point and turn the same to a photo ops opportunity. Bad days for the country</comment>

<comment>A Leader need to talk and have vision. Not like Maun Mohan who never talked and always followed diktats from Sonia.</comment>

<comment>Ya but the leader also shudnt be afraid of answering direct questions or participate in debates which ur fekubhai jumlawal will never do as all his speeches are written by his people and he just memorises them and recites on stage aid his signature high pitch and excessive drama when in reality he can't explain half the things he speak and another signature of his is cooking up ridiculous numbers on the fly and fool chaddi bhakts like u who follow him blindly like a sheep while chanting non stop NAMO NAMO</comment>

<comment>you always have the option of going to gulf and live n work there, same akin to other keralites. you can enjoy your beef curry there too.</comment>

<comment>welcome to the new India</comment>

<comment>Nairs, Ezhavas, Dalits and Christians should vote together to defeat the corruption mired UDF and the anti progress LDF. It is high time the intelligent Malayali goes for the third Front led by BJP for corruption free progress.</comment>

<comment>Then we all end up like communal gujarath..</comment>

<comment>like biharis voted for BJP</comment>

<comment>Why are u anti Hindu bro...seems like u were born with separatist Ideology.. Leave it bro...No one is going to Stop Hindus from taking what they deserve.</comment>

<comment>Nope. Like the trivandrumites voted for BJP in the recently concluded Corporation election. From 6 seats to 33 seats.</comment>

<comment>If Muslims can come together and vote for one party, if Christians can do so. Then why is it so difficult if BJP asks in Hindu names. perhaps you forgot how Mr Maulvi, self proclaimed representative of Muslims asked Muslims to vote for Congress on election eve. Why do ppl like you cry foul when it comes to BJP. On paper and in reality CONgrass is more communal thug with emergency and so many riots prior to 1990s</comment>

<comment>yes if they don't wanted the situation of Delhi and Bihar-- its relay sick  condition out there</comment>

<comment>Delhites and Biharis are the smartest Stupids in India..who chose Kejri and Nitish</comment>

<comment>According to warped Chaddi logic, only when they vote for BJPee, people become paragons of virtue !!</comment>

<comment>kerala will not vote for communal thugs BJP</comment>

<comment>I am pretty sure that the BJPee will not be able to open its account in Kerala.  At best, would win between 1 and 2 !!</comment>

<comment>dont they vote for communal thugs like congress,IUML??</comment>

<comment>Because they already have one as their cm. ..</comment>

<comment>the actual communal thugs are the UDF ( muslim league and the Christian lobby Congress a,b, c political out fits ) and you have the guts to try fool people here by calling BJP a communal thugs...shame on you scamgress  propagator</comment>

<comment>And why the BJPee leaders in Kerala are shamelessly  falling at the feet of Bishops !?</comment>

<comment>The mullahs and christians will only vote for congress, because they want a "secular" state. God help his own country.</comment>

<comment>Yes wait till mullahs become about 40% of population. then we will see who the jesus suckers vote for. Next nigeria in the making.</comment>

<comment>They and lakshmi fukrs are together in this..</comment>

<comment>christians r still better than mullahs, except their conversion tactics.</comment>

<comment>Kerala christians can learn from Goan Christians, who smartly voted for BJP but still get govt on their terms</comment>

<comment>KL Christians are not brainless like Goan Christians. KL Christians have our own tradition and culture. Here in KL we Hindus, Christians and Muslims live peacefully for generations.. Don't come with that Shitty BJP and spoil Keralas communal harmony.</comment>

<comment>Oh seriously Mr. John ...is everything ok in Mallapur..Did you forget the hand chopping of Mr. Joseph..by Mullahs...are you ok with the indirect discrimination going on with Hindus...Did you forget 'Love Jihad'.....you know what, a feared guy like you only can ignore this. Not We. and also..Its not u..who will decide..Its a common Keralite..who will decide.</comment>

<comment>You guys telling this incident for last 2 yr...pls leave mallus...let them leave in peace..</comment>

<comment>sorry sir, this time you got it wrong, if you want progress for your next generation try a change like Goan's ..no harm but if you stil try to support the corrupt and anti national just for religious preference then ..be ready to take every step back wards  ...and that will be the crime you do for your next gen good luck for you and the people who think similarly in your community</comment>

<comment>what progress u r talking about buddy? In education Kerala is far ahead than rest of India...I found ppl are smart and gentle in kerala..</comment>

<comment>like goa threw out BJP from 2005 to 2012</comment>

<comment>Bro ..you live in Past.. haaahaaa :)</comment>

<comment>talk about today, or if you wanted keep talking about  the past pl go on, but we are living in today</comment>

<comment>well said</comment>

<comment>Yes..If they allow beef and fielded christians mostly..then in other places also they will vote</comment>

<comment>People should choose if they want beef or good governance. I mean you can also survive by eating egg, chicken, mutton, fish, prawnsBTW, BJP has not banned beef in Goa</comment>

<comment>Bjp will never ban..they are another hypocrats like congis.2 sides of same coin</comment>

<comment>in goa there is no ban on beef. its like kerala , west bengal, tripura</comment>

<comment>true. christians in goa voted for BJP, mainly sue to parrikar's clean image.</comment>

<comment>I believe its not about Parrikar. Anybody from BJP will clean give a clean govt, look at all current BJP CMs. Atleast they will be 100 times better than Congress CM.</comment>

<comment>some BJP cm s r engulfed in some controversies and corruption charges, but parrikar has been a clean man.</comment>

<comment>All controversies are media created. For example, take Chattisgarh CM Raman Singh. His state is infested with maoists, but still he is trying his best to give good governance.</comment>

<comment>but his name came in PDS scam. yeddy name came in mining scam. so corrupts r everywhere including bjp, but maybe somewhat lesser than the congress.</comment>

<comment>BJP never boasted that its 100% clean and honest party. They just told they will give good governance and development.</comment>

<comment>thats true. unlike AAP which preaches honesty and does the same thing.</comment>

<comment>I feel sad for some state people, who consistently elect bad govts. I mean youhow bad a particular party or govt is. But during election times, you get swayed by media, who obviously are against BJP, and end up electing the samegovt which you hated. I mean where is your common sense? Dont you have brain ofyour own that you get swayed by media reports?</comment>

<comment>i dont consider every leader from the BJP as honest and clean, as after all we r indians. kuch to corrupt genes rahega hi.</comment>

<comment>True. There is no party which is 100% clean</comment>

<comment>Party doesnt make corruption, Its people. BJP equally corrupt as congress. Siddaramayya has clean image and gave more clean government than BJP yeddy-reddis such a castist leaders.BJP performance in center is pathetic now. So corrupt + failure is unforgivableThe moment i see that politician spending 1000s of crores to win, means that he is corrupt because they do that only because they will earn that money back.By the way ur Parrkar brother or some one recently cought in some corruption case</comment>

<comment>Do Christian & Muslim needs Hindu Votes??</comment>

<comment>Adopting a belligerent stand against Muslim extremism, Kerala Chief Minister V S Achuthanandan on Saturday said the radical Popular Front of India (PFI), which hit the headlines recently after its activists were accused of chopping off the hand of a college lecturer, was aiming to convert Kerala into a "Muslim country" in the next 20 years.Using unusually harsh language, the Chief Minister said the PFI was pumping money to lure youth into Islam and persuade them to marry Muslim women. "Their strategy is to make Muslims a majority community in Kerala... In 20 years, they want to make Kerala a Muslim majority state," he said. The lecturer's hand was chopped off after he had prepared a question paper that allegedly insulted the Prophet.The CM's comments came a day after CPM general secretary Prakash Karat spoke about the threat of Muslim terrorism in the context of the PFI activities. The CPM had named the PFI while talking about increase in terrorist activities in the country and pointed out that there was an "interconnection between communalism and the spawning of such terrorist activities".The incident had become a political hot potato in Kerala. Recently, the Congress echoing the PFI line had alleged that the Left Front government was targeting the Muslim community. With elections to local bodies scheduled for September and Assembly elections less than a year away, the Congress was clearly eyeing the sizeable Muslim vote base.Achuthanandan said terrorists were creating major problems in the state. The outfit, in its earlier avatar as NDF, had given training, money and weapons to youngsters to eliminate opponents. Now they were trying to create a clean image by organising freedom parades on the Independence Day. Several district administrations had already banned the parade, he added.</comment>

<comment>And in the ensuing election, the chief campaigner for VS was Abdul Nasar Maddani who is in jail for Terrorism related charges. He even invited that terrorist to the stage where he was doing election campaign. All these to get some Muslim votes.</comment>

<comment>Hats off to Achuthanandan for  taking the fundamentalists head on !!</comment>

<comment>Yeah Yeah. All of us have seen what he did. PFI and Abdul Nassar Maddani was CPMs chief campaigner. People are not fools. They still remember that horrible saga on stage.</comment>

<comment>hehe. dont try to pretend. u can only criticize hindu bigots, but u dont have the courage to do the same for islamists. ur a fake rationalist.</comment>

<comment>I do not need your certificate dear. I know what I am doing !!</comment>

<comment>hehehe. i have seen biased rationalists like u in many places. actually a true rationalist should be critical of every religious bigotry, not a biased one.</comment>

<comment>I condemn unequivocally every act of religious bigotry irrespective of faith !!  Who told you that it is otherwise !?I have written posts against ISIS and Al Qaeda too and also condemning slaughter of innocent animals during Bakrid which I have recorded here through a very long post !! You can just have a look at that if you are interested  in 717 killed in Mecca blah blah in first post !!</comment>

<comment>actually never seen u discussing about islamic bigotry anywhere. u always keep on discussing about hindu fringe elements and insult the hindu religion.</comment>

<comment>What can I do if you give it a miss ? Even day before yesterday I wrote a long post against ISIS !!</comment>

<comment>What do you think about Muslim bigotry, Forget ISIS....</comment>

<comment>All Religions are evil for me.  I do not identify people by their faith but see them only as humans.  But as the society has such fissures and divisions, it is hard to ignore them !!</comment>

<comment>"Using unusually harsh language, the Chief Minister said the PFI was pumping money to lure youth into Islam and persuade them to marry Muslim women"-- This has been case with Christian too. They too have lured or induced conversion. They shoudnt fear when muslim are following same steps. But Hindu must be careful from both of them.</comment>

<comment>i think xtians r still manageable, and they r not like the islamist goons. islamist ones r a great danger to our society. as far as conversion is concerned, its due to poverty and isolation of the lower castes by the upper ones. if we can change that, conversions wont occur in large scale.</comment>

<comment>Hindu votes cannot exist simply because Hindus are not given parasitic advantage as the shameless Indian constitution has done for 70 years by reservation policy. The point is on how to break the caste vote banks. It is silly for BJP to play congress B team game. One option is to build up a movement strong enough to demolish all mosques etc[I dont this option is real]. BJP should not be terrified of new ideas.Where was BJP irrational and immoral in Bihar elections? Less said of murderers of merit and criminals of opposition the better. Irrational and Immoral countries die - which is why I say India is already conquered by ISIS and ISI because of reservation policy1)Appeasement to thugs of pro-reservation, by saying "BJP is for not for scrapping reservation policy" is thoroughly immoral. Casteism is also communalism . Modi committed SUICIDE when he said it and the psychological space was left vacant with contest was between Laloo and Nitish. Why would Yadavs choose Modi when they have their own caste leader in Laloo?Lesson: Election results are entirely unpredictable and depends on whims and fancies of electorate. The master election strategy is - be moral. Even if you lose the elections openly say people are immoral. Dont make "people" into holy cows as socialists will like you to do.2)Begging of votes by Modi by reservation appeasement and begging for investments from foreign nations does not pay. Investors come to get profit and wont drop even a single coin into begging bowl of Modi3)Modi should have defined tolerance as tolerance to inequality - with the bold moral strength of people to say "Let better man win". Believe me people value morality and not just base instincts.=============================================Now BJP/RSS should bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit</comment>

<comment>In Kerala, christians or muslims will not go ahead & enforce their own ideologies on others even in their dominant areas. They just live the way they are, however regressive or otherwise it may be, and don't expect others to follow suit or interfere in their's. But if hindus are given any kind of upper hand, they won't stop till everyone out there follow their ways. Don't think so? Go have a look at cowbelt. Regular hindu population won't give a care, but its terror wing RSS/VHP will cook up trouble. Even muslim terror groups here like PFI aren't into forceful lifestyle changes. Kerala knows how to keep religion out of daily life, so keep trying but we'll have the last laugh. The sane ones.</comment>

<comment>If you are so secular, then why do you convert everybody left and right?</comment>

<comment>thats why malappuram has become a mini pakistan and T J Joseph lost his hand to islamists.even veterab CPM leader VS Achuthanandan had expressed his fear of islamists converting the whole kerala into another pakistan. go vomit ur lies somewhere else.</comment>

<comment>Vomit or otherwise, these are exceptions than norm. Yes there are issues & malappuram is called mini-pak for a reason. But it's so from couple of decades & still the cancer hasn't spread to nearby districts. They live in a shell, & most of them won't run out chopping arms at first call, unlike in north. The kind of extremist concentration we have here, the damage so far is negligible. And the way i know it living here, it's gonna stay like that for a long time. Most of them are extremists as usual, but only a rare few try to act on it with most of them under surveillance. Rest simply don't care, & it's same for all religions. Kerala lives just that way. We simply don't know what kind of RSS we have here, but if it's anything like from the cowbelt or even nearby karnataka, Kerala will fight it. People here may belong to some religion, but most don't follow any beyond moderate, and that keeps the peace. Facts be told, feel free to twist it as much.</comment>

<comment>PFI and NDF r doing their job nicely to make kerala into another pakistan.</comment>

<comment>u will realize soon, i assume ur a christian. i have got no prob with u people, except the conversion ones, thats still ok with me. but islamists will make kerala into a living hell, just wait for a few more years. even an atheist like achuthanandan has realized it.</comment>

<comment>I got no stake in religions, I'm an Indian, a Deist. Just another guy who's seeing hell being made around him in the name of religion & culture. We got a somewhat odd peace here, something which most other states cant boast of. To bring a firebrand cult into the fray will surely be fought off, but it's an added risk. If it's just the BJP with economic agendas that comes in, nobody got a problem. But along will sneak in its terror kids for whom we don't wanna give any place. We got enough of them in green color locked up already.</comment>

<comment>Hey san, who is "We" you are referring too?? Are they Muslim?? or Christians?? Hindus needs RSS badly and BJP is getting popular there.</comment>

<comment>khan gress is the most communal party in india, even dangerous than the AIMIM.</comment>

<comment>Is it secular to go after Hindu votes? Sounds a communal strategy. Where are the Bakras and Radjeep on the television studios?</comment>

<comment>Now its time for christian & muslims to convert more hindus so that they can get their votes easily, which is not at all possible now. Christian fathers work hard else you gonna lose power soon.</comment>

<comment>Why not possible ?  What are the steps taken by the Central Government recently to stop conversions ??</comment>

<comment>Well congress has taken no steps but it has only boosted it for its own gain. you cannot expect anything from it. It has ruled kerala & center for so many years.  Since kerala has no BJP , it has cristian or muslim population above national average. This shows how far congress can boost conversion.</comment>

<comment>I asked you a simple question inferring from your own post that conversions are not possible any more. You answer me straight forward and tell me the steps taken by the Central Government to stop conversions !!</comment>

<comment>Google it. I am not taking any class for it.</comment>

<comment>What is there to google here ? I am a regular reader of press and it can never escape my attention. There are just no steps taken by the Central Government to stop the so called conversions ? Only fringe outfits of the Sangh Parivar are doing this farce called as  Ghar Vapsi !!</comment>

<comment>In 2013, the Bharatiya Janata Party general secretary Venkaiah Naidu has declared that his party would bring anti-conversion laws nationwide if his party is elected to power in 2014.[25]:385 However, as of April 2015, the party does not yet have a majority in the Upper House of the Parliament. The president of party Amit Shah has challenged the opposition parties to support it in enacting such a law.[31] The US State Department has said that the recent wave of anti-conversion laws in various Indian states passed by some states is seen as gradual increase in ideological Hindu nationalism (Hindutva).[32]</comment>

<comment>Ha Ha Ha !! Again the inability to pass  the legislation is placed at the door steps of opposition.  Forget about BJPee ever getting majority again in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. 2014 is just a one off phenomenon which will never happen again in India !!</comment>

<comment>Never say never dude.</comment>

<comment>Laugh as much as for now. you will never make it again. Well happening or not happening is another thing. But their effort will count for sure.</comment>

<comment>rajya sabha has been the biggest roadblock, even during the UPA days.</comment>

<comment>Be happy next time if they will get 100 !!</comment>

<comment>I think they are strong guys , they have come up from 2 seats. So dont worry even they would laugh at 100.</comment>

<comment>Chhattisgarh in 2000 and Gujarat State in 2003 passed anti-conversion laws that prohibit forced or money induced conversions.[26][27][25]:385 In July 2006, the Madhya Pradesh government passed legislation requiring people who desire to convert to a different religion to provide the government with one month's notice, or face fines and penalties.[28] In August 2006, the Chhattisgarh State Assembly passed similar legislation requiring anyone who desires to convert to another religion to give 30 days' notice to, and seek permission from, the district magistrate.[29] In February 2007, Himachal Pradesh became the first Congress Party-ruled state to adopt legislation banning illegal religious conversions.[30] It was followed by Rajasthan in 2008.[25]:385</comment>

<comment>What is unique in this ? Even Congress Governments and the Governments run by regional parties have passed such legislations to stop illegal conversions. The point is if the legislation acted as a deterrent to prevent conversions ? Who is to decide which is legal or illegal when the Constitution has permitted right to propogate faith !?</comment>

<comment>actually congress during indira days used to think somewhat about hindu rights. though negligible. thats why cow slaughter ban was enacted. but the present congress under this momma-son duo is all for appeasement politics.</comment>

<comment>That farce of cow slaughter ban !! Ha Ha ha Ha !!And it is legal to steal the milk from the  cow starving its calf to satisfy human urge !!</comment>

<comment>Get your screw tight. No one starve, Instead they buy feeds from their earnings. And calf of India (even assumes hey are starved) better that African children. And yes there is nothing to satisfy human urge.      Yeah once I heard that Moslem used goats to satisfy their urge & its called sodomy.</comment>

<comment>lol</comment>

<comment>so ur saying that milk should not be extracted?</comment>

<comment>Ofcourse, if you really care and deify the cows as you want to portray to the World that it is Goddess. How can you steal from a Goddess ??</comment>

<comment>goddess takes care of her children by providing food. mother cares for her children by providing him/her milk. so cows r also in the same category. and i know we dont care for them, leave them in their own and they stray here n there eating garbage etc.</comment>

<comment>Do you really take the Cow's consent before milching milk from it ? Mother breast feeds her child voluntarily. Cow's milk is ordained by Nature for its calf and not for humans and there is no other species other than humans which depend upon another species milk where you steal from it creating a picture before it that it is only feeding its calf !?</comment>

<comment>could u plz tell me the way of taking consent from cows?</comment>

<comment>There is definitely no way of doing that. I know it well. But the point here is that you never take its consent nor it is feeding you voluntarily. It wants to feed only its calf, but what the sly humans do is to create an impression that it is feeding its calf by allowing it to s u c k l e  for a few seconds and then disturbing it by taking it away from its Mother to milch the cow themselves. How can you call this act as doing any justice to a creature which you want the world to believe that you consider as God ?</comment>

<comment>thats why i am asking u to provide some alternative source of getting milk. and BTW, the milk from cows and its products r not being consumed only by the hindus, muslims, xtians etc have it.</comment>

<comment>Why not ? There is Soya Milk and it is not necessary that you need Milk to survive. There are two conflicting views about Milk with one claiming that it is good for health and another claiming that it is bad for overall health.  So, its benefits is not conclusive !!I will pose this intriguing  question only to the Sanghis because it is they who claim that Cow is equivalent to a God and not others who do not think it more than any other animal and give them secondary status to humans !!</comment>

<comment>Let me know. Congress has ruled kerala for over years. Does Kerala has any such law??</comment>

<comment>Which law dear ??</comment>

<comment>I think this gives you a befitting reply??</comment>

<comment>ur wasting ur time.</comment>

<comment>might be, but let they know that they cant argue on fact.</comment>

<comment>What is fact dear ? The fact is that those who claim that Cow is equivalent to God are the worst kind of hypocrites when their actions are to the contrary and they abuse it in the most deplorable manner !!</comment>

<comment>he is a hidden congi. he will give u thousands of excuses.</comment>

<comment>I know he will.And I make sure he gets befitting reply for all his excuses. And let viewer decide who is right.</comment>

<comment>Any neutral viewer other than the Chaddis will decide that you are fools !!</comment>

<comment>actually these so called atheists/ rationalists r the biggest hypocrites i have ever seen.</comment>

<comment>Common substantiate this theory please if you have the gall ?  Where did you find my hypocrisy ??</comment>

<comment>Now let me guess your next worries..</comment>

<comment>Sickular bstrds getting nervous...when Hindus votes are sought it becomes communal poltics....retards even after realizing what has led to this keeps barking</comment>

<comment>Actually, Christian & BJP  leaders who courting each other now...it is not shamelss though  as  there are no permanent enemies  in politics.....Unlike  North India,  there are no untouchables in Kerala.......people from all communities sit together and eat beef, every one participates in other communities religious festivals etc. so there is nothing new if  BJP  is trying to get  Christian votes......BJP  needs votes and Christian leaders are concerned about  their interests in Rubber, plantations and also want to stop the implementation of  Madhav Gadgil committee report ( which has already been heavily diluted by Kasturi Rangan committee ) so it won't affect thousands of Christians who have taken over large plots of  ecologically sensitive forest areas and converted to plantations.  It is true that the Christian and Muslim parties in Kerala have enormously benefitted from their partnership with Congress as these communities have been able to open large number of  schools, colleges , hospitals  and higher educations institutions  etc. bypassing all laws...the education policy in the state is basically decided by the Christian and Muslim parties, whichever government is in power.  May be this time,  BJP atleast will be in a position to decide who will win the election and that will change the attitude of the main parties,  CPIM and Congress towards the Hindu community. All along,  these parties took the Hindu voters for granted. May be, not any more.</comment>

<comment>After Assam, BJP is only hoping for some good news from Kerala after assembly elections in 4/5 states this year. BJP is at zero currently and even getting one seat will be a news but the may Kerala's political situation is changing fast, there may be more pleasant surprises for BJP this time!</comment>

<comment>Shamless BJP spineless leaders is licking every Christian's feet to get votes in coming election in Kerala. BJP leaders made secret alliance with KM Mani, a highly corrupt congress minister who got kicked out of cabinet recently.</comment>

<comment>Why should they have stock of it ?  You Chaddi baastard !?</comment>

<comment>If so-called Hindu vote materializes, Left will be the beneficiary.  Leftist voters will not leave their ideology or party affiliation.  That is, their core vote bank will remain intact.  The will further eat in to Congress votes.Anyway, its high time that political parties try to act on their proclaimed secular policies - not favoring one community over others.</comment>

<comment>arundhati roy are u reading this , a fellow sickular fascist wants the votes of a  religion  abhorred by you .</comment>

<comment>It is unfortunate that a Progressive and enlightened  Kerala has become  a communal cauldron - thanks to the Sangh Parivar  !!</comment>

<comment>Progressive and enlightened land doesn't send half of its literate population to work as slaves in other nations. It creates infrastructure and jobs for its own people. Keralites can sing all goong goong here....but not accepting the failure of UDF and LDF is like acting blissfully ignorant.</comment>

<comment>Not due to sangh....either you don't know the reality in the state or ignore it....In kerala, the Marxist party has much more weapons and trained / hired killers than any other party...they have their own party villages where people from other party cannot even enter.....Kerala also has several hardline muslim fundamentalist groups who are very strong.....from the times of  Abdul Nasar Madani , Muslim fundamentalists have gathered in strength....the NDF  was another Muslim organization that elevated fundamentalism among Muslims to new heights.....they trained thousands of  youths and led violent protests against other organizations....they killed several people who worked with BJP , RSS and other Hindu organzations in cold blood, execution style....their operations were always very secretive and selective...the NDF got huge money from abroad and they even expanded their influence to many other south Indian states...few years back , around 5 Kerala youths were killed in Kashmir in battle with Army when trying to cross  over to Pakistan....inspite of all these, various governments,  congress and Marxist never did anything to counter them....later the NDF appeared in a new mask and changed name to Popular front.....they continued with their violent ways of protest till date....a college professors hand was chopped off  for alledgedly writing an article about Prophet..this happened in most literate Kerala state, notin north India...LDF and UDF used this terrorist organization as counter weight against RSS,  but they have now become so big that they may swallow the entire state....Kerala is sitting on a volcano which can erupt any time.......extremism  should be tackled , whoever perpetrates it,  be it  Hindus , Muslims or others, but  Kerala govts are doing nothing  to contain the spread of this poison</comment>

<comment>The doors of Ram temple at ayodhya were opened at the instance of Rajiv Gandhi there is much material written by many peoples points that.who was head of the country at the time of relatively large scale two riots. Yes, I am talking of 1984 anti-sikh pogrom at Delhi and October 1989 anti-muslim riots at  Bhagalpur. The SC appointed SIT was never constituted to investigate the interests and participation of top head of country and his requirements of these two riots just before respectively two  general loksabha elections 84 & 89 in country. Yes, the Congress’s centralgovernment, law and order situation and police of Delhi is always remainedbusiness of Ministry of Home “central govt. GOI”, and in case of Bhagalpurthere was also the Congress’s Bihar Government. In Delhi riots about 2700people were killed and in Bhagalpur riots about 1180 people were killed almost equal to after Godhra 2002 , these are figures of police records not from rumors. Both Delhi pogrom and Bhagalpur riots blew-up in small geographical areas when compared to riots in most portion of Gujarat including thousands of villages in 2002, which implies that Post Godhra riots were relatively difficult to control. A very few number of Hindus less than 10 were killed in all three ways “security forces bullets + in retaliationof opposite community + rioting mob of opposite community” at both places Delhi & Bhagalpur , but in case of 2002 almost 150 to 200 Hindus were dead due to all three ways. All these three ways were absolutely missing in Delhi and Bhagalpur riots means very few incidents of retaliation by Sikhs and Muslims. 2002 post Godhra riots and Delhi 1984 pogrom were in control after three days and In Gujarat there is very few killings on both side of communities after three days that too in rural areas difficult to control but Bhagalpur riots happened for very longer span of time. There was largest unorganized mob on roads in differently scattered places of Gujarat 2002 after Godhra ( some leftist journos in their bid to show communal Gujarat like above themselves says that 20 lakhs peoples were on roads in different villages ) , so it was very difficult to predict that where & when and which section of mob will convert in to rioters . Both post Godhra riots & 1984 pogrom were after sudden provocative  happenings not predictable one but this was not the case of Bhagalpur riots. Many peoples think that 1989 Bhagalpur riots on the eve of General Loksabha elections were left to happen to appease the Hindus of the country after two disgraceful chronological events Shah Bano episode in 1986 exposing the HardIslamist fundamentalist face of Rajiv Gandhi even Left was against theconstitutional amendment done by Rajiv Gandhi in this matter & Boforsscandal , there was a series of events to appease Hindus- Opening of Locks & Silanayas of Ram Temple Ayodhya-UP (relevant to mention before this BJP had failed to make Ram Mandir a issue) , killing of appx. 50 muslims youth at Meerat Malyana-Hashimpura-UP many peoples says that that had happened in custody of security forces ( Govt. at UP was also of Cong ) , starting the Loksabha election campaigning from Ayodhya by top head of country , experience of extraordinary win of largest ever 424 loksabha seats of 1984 elections after a strong communal consolidation with help of anti sikh riots was to be repeated in 1989 but in vain. Some says that in case of Bhagalpur the Muslims were demanding the transfer/removal of a Hindu S.P. , Superintendent of Police , from Bhagalpur but in vain when 1st incident of about 70 Muslims killings takes place the Bihar Govt. of Cong.announces the transfer but after visit of Prime Minister to Bhagalpur thattransfer was cancelled and main incidents of killings of Muslims take place in another three days. No one telling that there was communal anger in very large public after Godhra train burning same after assassination of Smt. Indira Gandhi , but this was not the case of Bhagalpur. Anger in case of 2002 Gujarat was so large that in some cases brotherly neighbors ( having very very good family relations earlier ) were inviting rioters to kill their neighbors and later on as some time passes they feel guilt , this thing is very much evident from telling of riots victims them self on great anti BJP NDTV & other channels and media like Outlook and Anti BJP so called intellectuals & jurnos like VM, VS , Thanavi , Rajdeep , Barkha and endless lists . So it was relatively much much difficult to control riots in case of 2002.  If 2002 was a Hindu-Muslim killing spreewhere Muslim deaths were four times as high as Hindu ones, in 1984 the numberof Hindus killed was zero. In fact, it was a Congress sponsored pogrom, and notquite a Hindu-Sikh clash. It was entirely one-sided. Rajiv Gandhi may not havecaused it, but he chose to ignore this for three days directly under his noseit altogether and let it happen and harness the political gains by preponementof loksabha elections. That in 2002 there was already highly viciousenvironment nationally and internationally as 1. attack on Indian Parliamenthad happened recently and 2. Indian Military was on borders under a operation (Perrakerram ? ) 3. 9/11 happened USA was engage Afghanistan after 9/11 etc..Military was called from border and was available on roads with shoot and sightorders just on next day of riots i.e. 1st march after 1st riot on 28th feb.Military and Police saved life of many peoples but in some cases unfortunatelypolice only saved himself , run away frightened of big mob of rioters in frontof them , their this activity left poor victims alone in front of bigcommunally angered mobs. In very few cases Police employees may haveacted communally . More so this is in very much contrast to what some personssays in case of Bhagalpur that almost in every significant incident ofBhagalpur 1989 , a different village on different day was being attacked by mobleaded by police itself as if police is doing some milittary operation andleading the mob to do something. In , Gujarat 2002 riots , there was entirelydifferent mobs at different places acting more or less simultaneously; up tosome extant different scenario from Bhagalpur. In case of Gujarat police &military was having shoot & sight orders but in case of Delhi initially theArmy was not called itself from Delhi Cantt. for one day and more so that armywas not having shoot & sight orders for another two/three days. I acceptthat environment in 1984 was also vicious not only by assassination on IndiraGandhi but also due to sikh militant activities of killing Hindus after pullingthem from buses & trains. But main stream of Sikh terrorism started after1984. Even so called intellectuals never talk about the benefits consolidatedby Rajiv Gandhi after 1984 was so huge and well collected gains of Riots bypreponing the election and same was planned anti Muslim Riots in Meeruth UP andBhagalpur Bihar under watch of Cong. Govts were there before 1989 elections .In Indian election history there is only one Prime Minister candidate who hadstarted his campaigning from Ayodhya and that is Rajiv Gandhi in 1989 by allthis he was trying to erase , Bofors and Saha Bano episode which he hadrealized that he had played foul even when both type of cadres Left & RSShad welcomed the Supreme Court decision in Saha Bano case but he chooses tobecome/appease Hardliner Muslim ( but realized later that he was wrong ) , fromPublic Memory and trying to repeat 1984 election success. I think that it isploy of Cong. that to keep Muslims economically & socially backward , Sothat they can remain a en-block Vote Bank which can be used whenever needed byusing some religious lollypops as Muslim Personal Law, Huj Subsidy , Salary toImams, Wakkf Board etc. and some time fear of security. This is proved by factsof conditions of Muslims in West Bangal & UP & Bihar. In these threestates Muslims are having very less % in Govt. Jobs in  comparison to their large % in population. Pl.don’t accept that Muslims were already in poor conditions in these threestates. It is very much clear that conditions of Muslims in these three statesis deteriorating where’s it is improving in rest of India. I also accept thatworldwide it is Muslim community which is most easily usable by harpingreligious sentiments and then stopping their economical progress so that theyremains a vote-bank.</comment>

<comment>LOL, yes blame the Sangh parivar now. Tomorrow you will blame the jihad in syria and iraq on RSS. 20 years from now even the Christians would be voting for the Sangh parivar, that is if they are still alive by then and living in Kerala and not as refugees in some neighbouring state like the Pandits.</comment>

<comment>Yes..holocaust against hindus is good for secularism. </comment>

<comment>a hypocritical comment... when a muslim votes for muslim its not communal but when hindu votes for hindu it became communal?</comment>
