<comment>    The BEAUTIFUL DIMPLES on his two cheeks make Rahul Gandhi ACTUALLY LOOK MORE HANDSOME than any BOLLYWOOD HERO!! So it is not surprising that MILLIONS of PEOPLE, especially the LADIES, like  to see Rahul Gandhi in political rallies and on their TV screens.    Why don't some FILM PRODUCERS seriously think about offering the ROLE of a ROMANTIC HERO to Rahul Gandhi in their Hindi films? They can CERTAINLY turn Rahul Gandhi into an INSTANT SUPERSTAR. After establishing himself as a SUPERSTAR in a couple of years, Rahul Gandhi can also SUCCEED in PLAYING a much BIGGER ROLE in Indian and world POLITICS. </comment>

<comment>Rahul Gandhi was caught by US police with his brazillian girlfriend in 2001 with 10 kgs of drugs and 10 million USD cash. Sonia begged Atalji to save her son and Atalji's large hearted ness or foolishness saved him. PM instructed the Indian embassy to get him released. The Vatican controlled paid indian media hushed up the whole incident. Else people of India would have known that Rahul with his gf is in US jail ! Also Atalji dug his own grave by saving Rahul baba else he could have thoroughly exposed congress and won a decisive second innings in office !</comment>

<comment>Secular Sources say that Dadri killing of Akhlaq was by his muslim neighbour only due to personal enemity between the two. That is why both his family and the Samajwadi Party and Azam khan shied away from CBI Probe ! But pre$$titutes like burkha dutt, and bhupendra chaubey ilks distorted and diverted the news to project muslims as victims always !</comment>

<comment>AK has no money to pay workers but has waived off the electricity, telephone and water bills of Jumma masjid of Delhi which is approximately 10 crores. AAPtards want to consolidate secular votes to make khujli pm in 2019, AAP is the najayaz aulad of congress and there is no difference between the two !</comment>

<comment>I am truly amazed at the depth of Kejriwal's friendship with the accused IAS Officer Rajendra Kumar. The extent to which Kejriwal is going, to defend Kumar, his IIT classmate, room mate, Civil Services batch-mate and presently close confidante & Principal Secretary, is truly the stuff legends are made off - a very close relationship. And we are amused to see the likes of so called Intellectuals such as Ashutosh, Sanjay Singh, Raghav Chadda etc., going out of the way to defend Rajendra Kumar even before he can be deemed to be innocent or guilty!!!!!! yeh to AAP nahin, corruption ka baap hain ! CBI raid on principal secretary office was a shock for him !</comment>

<comment>AK-49 was heard crying "Modiji aap ko pata nahin main kis mitti se bana hoon ! " People of Delhi replied Abe AK-49 humein pata hain ki tum to Suver ki tatti se bana ho because the whole Delhi is stinking with filth !</comment>

<comment>Nehru's family has not only lost the election but also the trust of this country.  They are functioning as ex-officio Prime Ministers and congress chief.  They have even misused the surname "gandhi", They still want to rule this country and are under the false notion that they are the only capable people to rule this country. We do not know for how many years we have to tolerate this family.</comment>

<comment>Mr PM, is that why BJP blocked parliament and many important bills, including GST, for so many years? to avenge its loss in 2004 and 2009 elections?</comment>

<comment>Well that means Mr modi understands what it feels like when you are disrupted from doing ur work! I wonder when will BJP stop meddling in Delhi governments functioning!</comment>

<comment>Plain Truth, change your name to PLAIN UNTRUTH.  The people of India became more & more poorer because of these people.  Wake up.</comment>

<comment>nobody is supporting Congress here, at least i am not. You are the one blindly supporting Mr Modi and BJP here. Wake up.</comment>

<comment>the difference is BJP blocked parliament demanding debate on scams, Congress blocks parliament preventing important bills to be passed.</comment>

<comment>no, BJP never wanted to debate, please go through the records of both houses. And ironically, it is BJP now which is refusing to sack its corrupt ministers.</comment>

<comment>Very bad, some peoples are not allowing Feku Modi (a slave of corrupt industrialists) to work for the benefits of his masters Adanis, Ambanis, Jindals etc. .</comment>

<comment>very baad some disgruntled lost politicians are not allowing parliament to function...so that those lost politicians can make a come back and start selling "GARIBI HATAO" for another 60 years.....very baaaaad</comment>

<comment>Bogus Baba, what about your lies to the people of India before the elections? You are equally a gaddar, having let down ME, who wasted a vote for you. I tell you clearly, just see the results of the coming 7 elections. They will throw you and your bunch of thugs out of the window and you will have nowhere to hide your face in shame. Moreover you yourself had opposed GST when Congress was in power. You think people have forgotten? Now get prepared for people throw you out in 2019. People of India have committed a BIG BLUNDER by electing you and your party.</comment>

<comment>and choose pappu....beta don't waste your vote next time and vote for pappu....don't commit BIG BLUNDER next time...</comment>

<comment>Actually saying that congress has got majority in Rajya Sabha only. The RS members were elected by the previous government MPs. In an election if the government was defeated all the MPs should resign. Like wise in RS also since the members were elected by the previous government they should also resign. Then only the present government should poss the legislation smoothly. Rajya Sabha members should resign now.</comment>

<comment>if you do not understand what role Rajya Sabha plays and what is its importance under our constitution, please learn but do not just comment nonsense for the sake of it.</comment>

<comment>I have not commended any thing wrong. RS members are not directly elected by the people. They are elected indirectly and nominated appointment also there. So when a government is defeated and another party newly elected, the question of RS members validity automatically arises. If the 90% of the previous MPs defeated their onward election also get invalided. That is of my contention and I have not mentioned anything about the function of RS.</comment>

<comment>RS members are elected by states and represent the states in the federal structure. They have nothing to do with Lok Sabha elections or MPs.</comment>

<comment>we all have understood why RS was made and what RS is actually doing...what RS MP BHARAT RATNA Sachin Tendulakr and their ilk is doing .......so get down the high horse...and lasly CONTITUTION is not QURAN that can't be changed...it has been and it should change as per time...</comment>

<comment>RS is very much relevant even now and it is thanks to RS that Mr Modi could not pass the land amendment bill to please his corporate masters. I can also cite many RS MPs who do much more work than Lok Sabha MPs. And it was through RS only that BJP blocked many bills while it was in opposition. So get don from the donkey and look at it in a unbiased way.</comment>

<comment>Yes thanks to Khangressi RS MP's land bill was not passed...no wonder u r gloating as your appointee has blocked the bill.....and Individuals MP don't matter....the collective might matters....BJP never had strength in RS....it is the tyranny of Khangres RS MP's which is evident....they by their attitude are making light of an institution formed for noble purpose....anyway I don't mind being called to get down from DONKEY....it reflects your attitude....have known how impulsive abuser u generally are...very much expected from KHAGRESS/PAAP camp...</comment>

<comment>60% of people of bombay who did not vote would be rejoicing ,see we knew this congress would ruin indian democracy and would not allow any bills to pass in RS so whats the use of voting in LS elections</comment>

<comment>BJP also did not allow any bills, including GST, to pass in Rajya Sabha when it was in opposition. You did not vote then too?</comment>

<comment>There was reason why BJP opposed GST, no without any reason Congress is opposing GST ,now all parties except Congress are supporting GST</comment>

<comment>what was the reason BJP opposed GST? Congress has given 3 clear reasons it is opposed to GST and as soon as govt agrees to at least of them (which most industry experts have also agreed to), it has said it will support GST. It is in fact BJP which looks like it does not want GST. Thats why it is doing all kinds of things to provoke opposition just before each session begins.Also, some NDA alliance state govts also want changes in GST.</comment>

<comment>which industry expert agreed to put GST rate in bill can you name some of them  ,</comment>

<comment>AK-49 was heard crying "Modiji aap ko pata nahin main kis mitti se bana hoon ! " People of Delhi replied Abe AK-49 humein pata hain ki tum to Suver ki tatti se bana ho because the whole Delhi is stinking with filth !</comment>

<comment>Nitish is much weaker now than he was with BJP. For Biharis Jungle Raj ke achche din wapas aagaya hain !In seats, JDU goes from 117 to 71.Strength of partner, RJD this time has 80 as opposed to 91 for BJP.In coalition strength, 178 instead of 206 with bjp.In coherence, BJP would stand-by him in every way possible. Now, JDU, RJD and Congress are old enemies working together.In governance, BJP has shown much, much better results everywhere. Laloo is a pathetic failure at governance, and will provide no administrative or technocratic input.Like for UPA. Still, expect a dark period of dramas. Like what happened with the AAP after the Delhi victory.</comment>

<comment>I am truly amazed at the depth of Kejriwal's friendship with the accused IAS Officer Rajendra Kumar.

<comment>Yeah tell all this to Punjab voters. You will yourself loose your chaddi and Punjab will have good time to see you naked.</comment>

<comment>Victor Asher Greenstein's statement - To my Indian friends, please take a moment to reflect on what a GREAT Prime Minister you have ! Narendra Modi is a man whom to me, has brought pride back to India. Given his hard work, popularity and the greatness of the man, there must be factions inside of India who are ardently against him (jealousy). Don't just show your support here on FB. When you hear a misinformed person say something negative about your Prime Minister, educate that person. Show up to the ballot box and support your Prime Minister. Go out to the streets and protest against vested interests inside of India that want to derail your Prime Minister's good governance agenda in office.You have an AMAZING Prime Minister and you have no idea what it is like to have had someone like that and not have that anymore. Here in the U.S. we once had a President like Prime Minister Modi. His name was Ronald Reagan and we didn't realize then how fortunate we were to have President Reagan as our President and I don't want you guys to experience the same with Prime Minister Modi--take a minute to internalize how FORTUNATE you are !..`</comment>

<comment>Ha ha which is why he lost his chaddi in Delhi and Bihar and he will loose his shirt and banian also in the coming 7 state elections. Just wait and see.</comment>

<comment>Hmmm. So Kejriwal is a Ford Foundation agent. Is that what you mean? The Central Government has ABSOLUTELY THE FULL POWER ON EARTH to catch Kejriwal even just now. They have CBI, Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax Department, Excise Department, Police, Raw, CID, Army, Navy Airforce, Interpol, Crime Department, Cybercrime Departments,Entire Home Ministry, litrerally everything to catch this Kejriwal mosquito. Still they are not able to catch him. So what you mean that BJP and the central government are a bunch of idiots and are not competent to do any job. They are FALTOO. Yes, you are true. Which is why you should NOT vote for BJP (Bakwaas Janta Party) in any of the 7 state elections in 2016 nor the General Elections in 2019.</comment>

<comment>AAPtards have lost the trust and credibility of the people of Delhi completely. Now no one listens to them.

Nobody cares a hoot for them, so wherever there is a news item aaptards quickly login and show their frustration on that forum making unverifiable baseless accusations against non AAPtards !

<comment>Why did Modi not explain why he and his party opposed the GST Bill for 7 years! Why is it that after opposing the nuclear liability clause for several years in the Parliament, he just had to please Obama to agree to it. The institution of Lokpal Bill was passed by the Parliament and many States have had Lok Ayukths but why did he not appoint one for 10 years?? He has  made many MOUs with many countries during the last year but we do not have results in big deal of FDI from China who instead are helping Pakistan , or in Australia on a mine to be taken over, or the Raffale deal as was planned by the Defence?. The Food Security Bill was passed and is accepted by many States but not by Gujarat? He signed a MOU with the J&K Govt and today their partner doubt his credentials?   We have had various forms of incidents on beef deaths, students suicide in Hyderabad and farmers' suicides?. The MNREGA was well administered earlier but suffers since Modi Govt took over? WHY, please why?  The list of failure to perform are many on the ground and he has no reason to explain except one single factor -other than himself  or his party or NDA Govt! Can he tell the voters who brought the RTI, RTE, Food security Bill, MNREGA,? Today our relations are not good with Nepal, Pakistan despite his hugging the leaders! Gujarat is in turmoil. His local party leaders have allegations against them while he sits quiet. The confusion on the reservation issue, was based o n the statement  made by the RSS chief, Mr Bhagwat but he blames others. Voters have had and continue to have faith in MODI Govt ( not NDA) and on the various schemes and slogans named by him. But the ground realities do not seem to match his intentions. He has been elected to do what he promised but so far this Govt has failed on most fronts with some limited success- higher inflation, poor local demand and domestic investment, poor exports etc  despite lower oil and commodity prices.. Modi has three years more for action and not just blaming others. We have had 8/9% growth during the previous Govt  without GST, high import prices of oil and despite many disadvantageous factors.; Planning Commission may have fared badly but the NITIyog has fared worse!! MOdi. please just move on and get things done by better coordination within his won party and all the parties in the opposition. Stop the jumla in e;lection speeches,. They did not work in Delhi or Bihar!</comment>

<comment>The reason why he is doing now everything that he opposed before is cause to come up wid new ideas that have to be better then the ones he opposed and that he is absolutely incapable to do and hides that inability by either renaming and repackaging older schemes and launching as his own or pointing fingers at opposition to mask his failures</comment>

<comment>Dont worry, Bogua Baba is a one film hero. He will return to Gujarat local politics after 2019.</comment>

<comment>He will be joining jasodaben in some vridh ashram</comment>

<comment>Iyer Saheb, please take this point? 1.About GST bill, why the 3 points raised by Congress now, when it was not there originally.2. let me tell Obama is democrat, Republican will be good for India. Modiji has to follow protocol.3.  In 70 years, govt have not reduced poverty, generate employment or self respect, and you expect miracle now. ROME was not built in 5 year.4. We don't required any bill (Food security, MNREGA etc). This is will automatically when the India court system delivered justice quickly. Nirbhaya rapist is still enjoying tax-payer money.5. Modiji cannot solve all the problem, everybody needs to take responsibility.6. Lastly, Indian want every thing free and we need to understand nothing is free. If we get free today, tomorrow our children have to pay.I think u are happy with Bihar and the environment. Then I request you to please invest your had earn money there. I cant speak about Delhi, it's stinking, I can open my mouth like you.Stop dividing country and expecting results.</comment>

<comment>The three points were raised becasue this Govt introduced the 1% surcharge. Next the ceiling of 18% has been supported by the Chief Economic Adviser as figures of 1 24 and 27% were being talked about. The third point about the GST Council was raised was relevant as the Govt is a party involved and have the majority in the Council which is not proper. Besids most of your other points raised do not give any answer the issues raised. Modi will succeed if he gets out of the Gujarat syndrome where h e controlled everything and everyone.. India consists of different States with different problem,and requires pertinent solutions. I wish to make it clear that I am no Congress fan while you are obviously a blind follower of Modi and his Govt. You are free to have your own opinion but leave me to mine and where I should invest or what I should do or say.</comment>

<comment>Iyer Saheb, I didn;t read ur response and not worth of reading. Please tell me why my country is so backward as compare to other nation. Why Dalit were not given fair chance, in name of Dalit only elite Dalit (who can efford) is abusing the geneorsity of Indian  Taxx payer.</comment>

<comment>The oft repeated statement made by all BJP leaders and their followers like you as though India today is the same as it was in 1946/7 and nothing has been done. The actual figures of poverty reduction has been a study by many economist and the World Bank. the GDP growth in the last  ten years are also well known unless someone chooses to be ignorant. Why do States have to a wait for the Supreme Court to question a State who do not implement a Central Act unless that State does not care for the poor. No one expects this Govt to solve all issues in two years. They have 5 years to prove that at least something is done  for the country../ No one wants anythimg free unless you expected it from Mr Modi who promised  Rs 15 lacs in every account from the black money supposed to be stashed abroad.</comment>

<comment>People who are incapable of doing anything always points fingers at others for their failures.did ge forget that congress learnt this obstructionusmfrom him and jhootley and the entire country knows whos playing revenge politics after losing delhi and bihar </comment>

<comment>A 250 acre plot for just Rs. 1.5 crore! Just imagine that. That is a pittance for that kind of land. Blatant nepotism. Under Modi's nose, Anandiben has been running a ma-beti sarkar. You know what the real ideology of most Indian politicians (like most Indians) is? To mint money. Secularism or Hindutva are simple smoke screens. If those were the real ideologies, we would have seen uniform civil code, a Ram temple, removing government interference only in Hindu temples and so forth. We have not seen that. All that we see is blatant nepotism. First on one side, then on the other.</comment>

I can see no difference between the present and the past incumbent except that Dal Prices have sky rocketed, petroleum product prices not coming down due to the Finance Minister playing truant by imposing more taxes and cesses to offset the precipitous fall in International crude prices, health and education costs still going up to absurd levels, corruption still part and parcel of our Bureaucracy at every corridor of Government departments, services of Public utilities  like Railways even going down despite the stiff hike in Passenger rates etc.What is really the change you are talking about ? And do you seriously think that Feku can sell this illusion of change to this Country ? Remember, India is just not Gujarat where Feku can escape with all his bundle of lies !!</comment>

<comment>Congress screwed everything for 60 yrs & if Modi govt  fails to remedy all that in 19 months, he is "failed". Great.... anyways please have a look at the initiative n work started by this govt.. atal pension scheme, insurance plan for all, direct cash transfer, crop insurance scheme, Orop, affording housing scheme, sanitation, infrastructure project .. etc...</comment>

<comment>was just fed up of inefficiency n reluctant attitude of sarkari babus.. things have started changing now...</comment>

<comment>Well the Congress lost its hegemony in many States in the late 1980s itself.  And so, if you are going to blame it for mishanding everything then that borders on the sheer  ridiculous and shows your extreme bias and prejudice.  The State Governments and Local bodies too have a role in shaping the Nation. India is not a Country where you can govern executing orders sitting in the Lutyenistic comfort of Delhi. It is a complex Nation with its myriad of problems at all levels and stuck in the labyrinth of neck deep corruption !!Why Feku is being questioned is only because he created exaggerated expectations just bamboozling the gullible masses and spread this canard about Gujarat's prosperity through a systemic propaganda which was far fetched from reality !!Regarding many of the schemes you have pointed out, most of them were plagiarized from UPA which the BJP was opposing and that is tantamount to betrayal.  And these  insurance schemes have been conceived to benefit the Private Insurance Companies which has lobbied with the Government and everybody knows through experience as to how difficult it is for everyone to get their claims settled when their papers get stuck with the Officials of these Insurance Companies.  Swacch Bharat has been a disaster as it was not conceived with the right intentions to make it a success but only has been rolled out as a publicity gimmick by roping in celebrities for just a one day tamasha.  There has been no visible change on ground due to this initiative with even the Capital stinking. OROP and the implementation of 7th pay commission can only be a drain on the exchequer rather than enhance productivity !!</comment>

<comment>Exactly true.</comment>

<comment>The Nehru dynasty is full of scoundrels and cheats.  Indra Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were top in the list, and now Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra are talking nonsense most of time with their mother Sonia Gandhi playing all types of anti-democratic politics.  As a nation, India is luck that the prime-ministership terms of Indra and Rajiv ended.  Nowadays, Maneka and Varun Gandhi have also started talking nonsense.  Nevertheless, the BJP keeps them under good control.  If Sanjay Gandhi were alive, the nation would have been looted rapidly.  Gone are the days of Motilal and Jawaharlal Nehru !  The present crop in the Nehru dynasty is full of crap.</comment>

<comment>Not really. Before Lok Sabha election, there was so much hype about so called Guajarat model that many people thought Gujarat is more devloped than America, Germany and Japan combined. It is but natural ppl are surprised to know that Guj is just like all other Indian  states.</comment>

<comment>Are Bhakths and Toadies any way different ?</comment>

<comment>There are loads of er bhakts who appreciate what ak does. Tell me one thing your gang has ever appreciated about modi. Now don't lie that there is nothing...</comment>

<comment>Well, for the nth time, let me repeat that I am not a supporter of any party or personality !!Now you ask me, what I admire about Feku ?  His ability to lie profusely !! He just doesn't care about the contradictions and hypocrisy that are always associated with his demagoguery !!</comment>

<comment>And yet after so much the only thing that feku can talk about in his speech is about blaming congress. With so many accomplishments under his belt he just needs to tell these and people wud be stupid not to vote for him.hahaha</comment>

<comment>The Nehru dynasty always presented India as a tribal nation not even worthy of the worst African and South or Central American country.  That is the way they have portrayed themselves t be the saviors of the nation.  In fact, we became prosperous as a nation only after the horrible, unforeseen and tragic deaths of Sanjay, Indra and Rajiv Gandhis.  If they were alive, we will wreak in extreme financial poverty, educational ignorance and political or military weakness.  These idiots were the antitheses of Motilal and Jawaharlal Nehrus, and were contending for political power without any competence, integrity or conscience -- mainly banking on their Caucasian appearance to political strardom !</comment>

<comment>Do u know wat indias condition was at independence.we were dirt poor and the entire population was displaced and yet nehru and the later ones built it one step at a time and look at feku, with absolute numbers in one house and country in a good state he is unable to do anything except pointing fingers at others just imagine where india wud be if it had been him instead of nehru in 1947 and it is sheer hypocrisy to take responsibility of all good things and hold others responsible for all wrong things</comment>

<comment>A report in The Economic Times Friday said business associates of Anar Patel, Dakshesh Shah and Amol Shripal Sheth own Wildwoods Resorts and Realties, which was allotted 400 acre near Gir Sanctuary. Of this, 250 acre was given away at an official rate of Rs 15 per sq m. “Filings with the Registrar of Companies, accessed by ET, show a number of transactions between her (Anar) and her business partners that started when the Gujarat government allotted 250 acres of public land to Wildwoods Resorts and Realties,” says the report.But Anar Patel describes herself as a social worker??? Maybe in Gujarat's Development Model social workers are very rich??? How come Arnob Goswami is not screaming yet??? </comment>
