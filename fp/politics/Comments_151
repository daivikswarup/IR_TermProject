<comment>"But, the level of political awareness among people even in remote villages can give poll pundits a serious complex. At every corner in the state, you will find a psephologist, usually dressed in a lungi, in the company of semi-naked children and a couple buffaloes, armed with facts, figures, data and latest trends."LOL. Is that why they are voting for a convicted criminal like Lalu? Please the average Bihari is an illiterate moron.</comment>

<comment>What remains when you remove the vote part from the "vote katwa"?</comment>

<comment>Owaisi support "Secular candidate". This is the meaning of secularism in INDIA. Anything in favor of Muslims and against Hindus is considered "SECULAR". Is this the India we got after giving the huge land in partition?</comment>

<comment>Actually Owaisi is extremely intelligent and I think he wants good for India. I can easily see him and Modi as allies in the future. Sounds strange, but it is quite possible.</comment>

<comment>And the #paidmedia circus continues. It is well known that Muslim madrassas spew venom against non-Islamic people and traditions. This is the case not only in India, but in Europe, and the whole world in general. Muslims are creating havoc in whichever non-Muslim societies they live in, whether that is in Europe, the West or any non-Muslim country in general. They are brainwashed throughly every Friday at the mosque and filled with hatred - please note how all "riots" begin on Fridays. All terrorists have gone to or go to Madrassas. There is nothing new if this is stated in the RSS magazine.There are instances daily of Muslim faithers killing daughters as old as 4 years old for not wearing head-scarf, and Christian priests abusing young boys in the Churches and the media keeps singing the same Dadri incident as if it is the only news-worthy item for coverage. Get over it already you paid agents. Shame on all of you. You will be jobless soon.</comment>

<comment>Please vote for the candidates not for the  caste!</comment>

<comment>The logic in the article suggests that Muslims vote only for Muslims.The following is a true story that happened in India. My source is authentic :-In a particular Jesuit run school, an overwhelming majority of pupils were Catholic.The time had come for students to elect the Head Boy for that year. When the students ballot papers were counted the winner happened to be Hindu while the runner up was by faith Catholic.I refuse to believe that a person always votes for a candidate of the same religion.</comment>

<comment>This is education in ttuth</comment>

<comment>Not really. They in fact will not vote for owaisi. They just dont want to be governed by someone openly hostile to them like RSS under the mask of BJP. They are doing it for their safety, thats all.</comment>

<comment>It would be foolish to write off Owaisi. This is the first election he is contesting outside his turf and no party ever did well in the very first election they fought. Remember Kanshi Ram and the BSP ? Their performance in their first attempt at the hustings was nothing to write home about.This , however, did not come in the way of BSP emerging as a major force in UP politics subsequently. Owaisi knows that the muslims are the only large social group without a party of their own. It is a matter of time before he emerges their leader.</comment>

<comment>Kanshi Ram had a great line on this - "पहला चुनाव हारने के लिये, दूसरा चुनाव जितवाने के लिये, तीसरा चुनाव जीतने के लिये." First election to lose (just getting experience and learning), next election to make someone else win (learn to capture some of the vote and participate in a coalition), third election to win.</comment>

<comment>Ii believe there is a lot of wisdom in Kanshi Ram's statement.</comment>

<comment>Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by wise people as false and by the rulers as useful-Seneca (4 BC-AD65)</comment>

<comment>Very nice</comment>

<comment>"Bihar may have the image of a state handicapped by poverty and illiteracy. But, the level of political awareness among people even in remote villages can give poll pundits a serious complex" Mr. Sandipan......but Mr. Sharma if Bihari vote for Jungle Raj combo of RJD-Congress-JDU, you praise will be worthless!</comment>

<comment>Sharma  not even a pretence of neutrality ??? Good going !!</comment>

<comment>Owaisi - self proclaimed owner of Muslims. Modi/Bhagawat -self proclaimed owner of Hindus, Both these leaders are trying to sell Muslims/Hindus wholesale</comment>

<comment>No, I disagree. Owaisi is more like Modi than like Bhagwat. He is a diehard Indian and I love how he represents all Indians when he is abroad. I think he has a bright future in Indian politics because he is media-friendly and understands more about how the country is losing its identity-centricity, especially among the young. Younger Indians will vote for whoever brings development and security. If he is able to articulate this, even Hindus will vote for it. Bhagwat is very different - he is a communal person.</comment>

<comment>Muslims in all states want to live in peace with all other communities. All round progress they are craving for is not understood by any Muslim leader including Mr Owasid</comment>

<comment>In India every one is a self proclaimed leader of minorities as is congress and as is lalu or MSY. .. The real question is why r u pretending otherwise? </comment>

<comment>Because our Secularism is a mirage.</comment>

<comment>Owaisi need not battle for secular candidates, let him battle for BJP candidates. If BJP wins this time, he can win next time by garnering "Muslim Votes". Both BJP and Owaisi's MIM are two sides of the same coin, both are dangerous to the unity & integrity of India</comment>

<comment>Ya ya. Desh looto CONg parties are good for ation.stop getting daily dose of knowledge from paid-media headlines.U kind of coward pee sized brains support CONg style of status-Quo.Hindus are being killed in 1000s across the nation.

<comment>So muzzies want to be secular and not vote for owaisi, its their choice. But doesnt matter as we Hindus will still vote for modi no matter how much riots BJP orchestrate. We dont need secular parties.</comment>

<comment>I don't think so at all. I think Hindus will vote for Owaisi if he consitently advocates for development over a long period of time. It will happen. I would vote for him.</comment>

<comment>Alahchod brahmin.</comment>

<comment>Haan ji! Muzzies are very secular. Only Hindus want riots...</comment>

<comment>Dont be so anti-hindu.. Not all Hindus want riots.</comment>

<comment>That was you. Not me. Go reread your comment again...</comment>

<comment>You've clearly said all Hindus wants riots... Your hate is quite obvious. Moron.</comment>

<comment>I just agreed with you moron. Lets see, being sarcastic forever addled your brains?</comment>

<comment>Creep</comment>

<comment>This dog will be the defacto leader of sunni Muslims of this land in 5 years. </comment>

<comment>I don't think so. Hindus and Muslims have both splintered.</comment>

<comment>This naked run for MUSLIMS votes are truly disgusting. And Muslims are increasing their population very rapidly and they are using this as a weapon, not for their progress but they are telling just whoever will look away from our community , we will vote for them. CONGRESS ,RJD ,JDU ,TMC ,SP are such parties are buying their votes . Everywhere the same debate MUSLIM  vote and MUSLIM vote...</comment>

<comment>Notice the heartburn among bhakts... How can owaisi let the keepers of hindutva down... Sob sob</comment>

<comment>Yeah, normally he manages to pull all the communal voters within a particular religion...</comment>

<comment>Sandipan clutching at the straws. Owaisi never said that he will contest all over Bihar. He always said that he was gonna be restricted to a pocket in the Seemanchal area. Still SSharma fears the kata effect on Nitish-Lalu combine due to this!! LOL!!</comment>

<comment>Wishfull thinking from a Congress A licker:)</comment>

<comment>Oh so you are praying for owausi now... That is a new low even for bhakts</comment>

<comment>Im not! but he will get as many seats as Pappu's kindergarten!!</comment>

<comment>Bjp in delhi</comment>

<comment>You got that right, we're not pro-RSS, anti-Muslim, what we despise is the consistent secular blackmail by politicians of  the lalu/diggy mould.Any enemy of the enemy is not a friend, but certainly an ally.</comment>

<comment>Great... So owaisi is the new hero for bhakts... Congrats</comment>

<comment>What fanstastic critical reasoning you have there, chief?</comment>

<comment>And your hindutva is commendable</comment>

<comment>Your Congress Bhakti was soooo evident in 1984.</comment>

<comment>And Owaisi has proved to be a non starter in Bihar. This is most likely to help the larger Janata parivar alliance in further consolidation and might further prove detrimental to the NDA's  prospects. At the moment, it does appear that Nitish might stave off the anti-incumbency factor and will be ready for another innings !!</comment>

<comment>The real reason of this article is try to keep the sickular vote bank intact, whose distribution is a death knell for the Maha-chors. If BJP's team had stayed more disciplined and also worked a little harder, we would have seen a sweep. Still it is a close, yet important election. Bihar's showing can really propel NDA to move faster on the progressive agenda.

<comment>The plight muslims are in today is self inflicted because of choosing wrong leaders. Most of them want to keep muslims uneducated. This can be corrected only by one from that community. Perpetuating the victimhod theory will not help. This country is vast and secular for time immemorial for everybody to live peacefully.</comment>

<comment>I just want to add that Owaisi is not the culprit here. The culprit is the way vote bank politics is played in our country. Hindus rejected the Hindutva Politics until they realised that all the so called secular parties are anti Hindu. Even a new comer like kejriwal was drawn into a communal fight when he fought the Banares seat.I think on the other hand, if owaisi says he wants to do good for all Indians, no indian will have any problem with it. As long as he is not against.Mahagatbandhan is a bigger religious outfit than owaisi. At least owaisi is not afraid to accept the truth.</comment>

<comment>BJHPigs are very sad that their hidden weapon has misfired</comment>

<comment>No issues it happens to every party he is the only poster boy of this party and even won seats in sobo He will need time to build the party He is the jinnah of india </comment>

<comment>good verry good, i thing u r screwed up a little and missed the greater part of history. Islam came on earth only 1500 years ago.. where as hindu (sanatan) dharm was from the beginning of our ancient civilizations. and scripted 5000 years ago as Veda. and now it is 5117 Yugavda.Be respectful to each other brother . Rulers have no religion they are not hindu, not muslim , they are just rulers and they know how to use common people by means of religion or color or anything. SO IF YOU ARE A HUMAN BEING THEN BE RESPECTFUL TO EACH OTHER AND USE YOUR BRAIN A LITTLE. trust me you also have a brain. ;)</comment>

<comment>Owaisi is a third grade, third rate opportunist politician... He and his brother incite people to divide them across religious lines.. I do hope sanity prevails in Bihar voter's mind and the two crook brothers are taught a good lesson....</comment>

<comment>By the way he came into poll picture in Bihar with the sole intent of dividing the muslim voters, so that non bjp votes get bifurcated into various groups. And BJP wins with its core voter base.. It has been revealed who he was batting for!</comment>

<comment>Sandipan is a secular (by Indian definition, it means muslim ass-kisser) and Owaisi "doing" secular candidates must mean Sandipan has "wet" dreams about Owaisi !!!! LMFAO</comment>

<comment>Last time we interacted we did not agree to each others view point but on this I am in full agreement with you. Both Owaisi and Kejriwal are crooks  of the first order. One is out to destroy the communal atmosphere in the country and the other is destroying its capital. India's policy on the Israel- Palestine conflict has been directed to see that the minorities are not offended whereas it should be based on our national interest. Luckily, this is going to change.</comment>
