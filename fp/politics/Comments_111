<comment>It is very easy for the politicians in India to defend a wrong. Just say it is political vendetta by the opposition, witch hunting and so on and on. When they get a bail in a criminal case their supporters celebrate as if they have won an Olympic medal. Politicians believe in the theory that if they do something wrong then it is their right and if others do the same then let's flog them to hell.</comment>

<comment>Considering the speed of the judiciary, there is not much else to be expected. Nobody will get convicted while he is alive, so cases will be cancelled (e.g. Bofors, Union Carbide). Because there is no risk of conviction, politicans can claim vendetta politics or even indulge in vendetta politics. Just an allegation is enough to tarnish a person's reputation because the people also know that the case will never end.</comment>

<comment>Who allotted the land, Hooda or HUDA?</comment>

<comment>This is true corruption. Where is keijriwal? Oh wait. He's congress B team.First of all why did Haryana govt a lot land to a defunct company?????</comment>

<comment>It is amazing to see how there is no fear of law in the Congress leaders. There comments come as if they own the country and it judiciary.</comment>

<comment>This the reason congress kept country illitrate</comment>

<comment>But they do...</comment>

<comment>The politicians are not bothered about court as they know how to come out or how to lingering the case for years.</comment>

<comment>And keijriwal says not single word about massive scandals of congress. He's supposed to be corrupt crusader. But in realty he goes to hug Sybil of corruption in Bihar. </comment>

<comment>It is unfortunate, but this is true, Kejriwal is power hungry and he has no love for any one (not even for his children) when it comes to acquiring power.</comment>
