<comment>The truth is JATs didn't tolerate a punjabi CM in a state which has a history of JAT domination. When Hooda was in power , Jats were enjoying a luxurious life under his rule. He was recommending them in a government jobs. Moreover they didn't have to work too much in a office during hooda rule</comment>

<comment>The tape making rounds on social media makes it abundantly clear that Congis were behind the Jat trouble ...We dont want congis to rule us .... Never ever ...They have stooped to the lowest of low to acquire power ... Shame on you ... Whatever the loss was incurred during the riots should be recovered from congress fund ... especially Hooda's property ...Our next generation should read about the congis only history books ....</comment>

<comment>all policemen in haryana are jats ...all appointed bypassing merit   on political considerations  all are corrupt and criminally minded all  were watching with pleasure   as jat goons looted and burnt shops</comment>

<comment>Khattar wants to give reservations to Jats by protecting OBC reservations at the expense of general  merit. BJP is anti-National.------------------------------------------------------------------What if the state is captured by a mob? India is a Ocholocracy [mob rule] as Individual rights( like merit) is murdered, by definition, as by reservation policy and Individual right of property rights are murdered by Socialism. Will you call Jats who destroyed an entire state as anti-National? Will you call kapus anti-National as they burnt a train. Pro-Reservation agitation is action as compared to just hot air of sloganeering [logically punishment should also be hot air]. VP Singh has made constitution anti-national and Modi I suspect will bring private sector reservations to become another VP Singh----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------No Support to Khalid. Kanhaiya Kumar is different as he is not a member of communist Democratic Students Union which is for the murder of Individual rights and is for collectivism. Communists support reservation policy, which is murder of Individual right of merit and also are for demolishing property rights another important Individual right.Kanhaiya Kumar as PM!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------However Let us examine Sedition laws------------------------------------1)Law of Vikamaditya: A prostitute hears a Brahmin who says to his friend that she had appeared in the Brahmins man's dreams and she was wonderful. The Prostitute drags the Brahmin to Vikramaditya for her fees. Vikramaditya hangs a bag of Gold and asks the prostitute to get her fees from the MIRROR. If service is virtual reward is also virtual. In sedition laws if the 'crime' is talking then the punishment should also be 'talking'2)USA Laws protect a person who burns the National Flag as the crime is CONSIDERED virtual and is not action. State acts when the 'crime' is in action3)In Kedar Nath Singh’s Case, 5 judges of the Supreme Court – a Constitution bench – made it clear that allegedly seditious speech and expression may be punished only if the speech is an ‘incitement’ to ‘violence’, or ‘public disorder’. Subsequent cases have further clarified the meaning of this phrase. In Indra Das v. State of Assam and Arup Bhuyan v. State of Assam, the Supreme Court unambiguously stated that only speech that amounts to “incitement to imminent lawless action” can be criminalised.There is a flaw in the LOGIC  of supreme court. How can an INDIVIDUAL be punished for the actions of the mob - particularly when India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] as the reservation policy agitation of Kapus and Jats showed. IS IT THE FAULT OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAT INDIA HAS BECOME EXPLOSIVE? HOW SHOULD THE INDIVIDUAL KNOW IN ADVANCE if a situation will explode? The faulty logic of mixed economy[read article on mixed economy down below] and acts of VP Singh, which made the constitution anti-National. Indira Gandhi has made the constitution anti-national by inserting socialism[as by definition legal robbery, as distinct from charity and implies forceful SNATCHING]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arun SHourie put the problem in two words Present BJP govt is congress+cow. He implied Modi has been a failure. Failed persons in politics can be dangerous. I strongly suspect that he will try to bring in private sector reservations and try to become another VP SIngh, who made the constitution anti-national along with Indira Gandhi when she inserted legal robbery of socialism into constitution.--------------------------------------------------------------------The solution is to apply merit to PM on the basis of  MERIT. I had recommended, earlier:Now BJP/RSS should be creative, PROACTIVE, and bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics. USA experience shows that goons kill each other in presence of free gun laws. None will kill with a legal weapon.2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=========================================================Mixed economy is a fascist economy. Bureaucracy/mafia politician becomes the supreme arbiter. Consider reservation policy: The only work of a government is protection of Individual rights - Jefferson, 2nd president of USA.. President of India as head of state has to commit suicide as merit, an Individual right, is murdered by reservation policy. The state is duty bound to protect Individual from mobs. Such arguments are not answered but ignored -- what the state does is right. Nazism was stateism like socialism. Those who could obtain power could justify state-sponsored murder and plunder by pointing out that since morals don't really exist and are merely a product of one's class or upbringing, there is no moral argument against the state version of murder and plunder.Socialism introduced into constitution during emergency is legal robbery. Way forward is capitalism[another name of freedom]Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim’s gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of money taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials and mafia politicians.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, but that it cannot be used honestly.Why does not the state allot a seat strictly on merit and snatch it away OPENLY?Gandhian Socialism of BJP is Gandhiism [selling of ones supporters to gain support of Jinnah and Muslims and Socialism is legal robbery]</comment>
