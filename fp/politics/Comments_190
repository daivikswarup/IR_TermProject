<comment>Is a mercenary and makes no bones about it , unlike MMdS who kept up a pretense of being something else. Also lacks his guile, ability, and tenacity. Would make it easier for some to manipulate her. Expect PR in J&K within 6 months, and no dearth of theatricals before then.</comment>

<comment>Oh for God's sake, stop this inane glorification of the dead. Two articles to sing praises? If one has done good, commend the action while they are alive and move on.</comment>

<comment>How come there are multiple FP articles on this issue by Mr. David Devadas? Couldn't FP get a reliable and credible person to write something positive about Mr. MM Sayeed?</comment>

<comment>Mufti was hardcore communal at heart, who know how to milk the Indian system, was responsible for the riots against Kashmiri Pandits  in Anantnag. And the Author seems to be an ignorant a**hole.</comment>

<comment>India must cancel this mourning thing.. no mourning for any leader who dies including prez or PM.. in fact people should work hard on that day and just donate the day's earnings for the welfare of society in the name of the person who dies..</comment>

<comment>Hey AAPtard, stop ranting...Why do you want to hurt sensibilities of terrorists and Pakis?Dont you want BJP to get full power in JK?Doesnt BJP want Rajya Sabha majority?</comment>

<comment>Why will an AAPtard worry about BJP? getting a majority in RS?</comment>

<comment>Was Muftiji a greater nationalist than Shaheed Bhagat Singh?If drug dealer Badal can be Mandela, then why not?</comment>

<comment>LOL</comment>

<comment>Muftiiji was a true nationalist....thats why he was CM of BJP coalition..He definitely deserves a 7 day nationwide mourning and Indian tri-colour flying at half-mast</comment>

<comment>Kohram movie should be screened in Kashmir!</comment>

<comment>Why 7 day mourn for his death? will there be a state mourn when a soldier dies in the battle field? pathetic...</comment>

<comment>Now if Mehbooba becomes CM and BJP continues supporting PDP, it means that all their claims about dynastic rule is nothing but political BS.</comment>

<comment>after all who can forget his prophetic statement during oath taking!</comment>

<comment>What was that?</comment>

<comment>He credited Pakistan and militants for letting peaceful polls in J&K happen.</comment>

<comment>RIP Muftiji..Mufti Sahab supported Kashmiri Pandit re-settlement in Kashmir.You hated Pakistani terroristsYou were a nationalist at heart.That's why BJP made you J&K Chief Minister......You will always reside in hearts of Modiji and his Bhakts..They will always cherish your memory..</comment>

<comment>He hated terrorists thats why so many Pak flags were raised in last 18 months in Kashmir and he did nothing about it.</comment>

<comment>Looks like author's command over facts is bad as Rahul Gnadhi's IQ ... Firstpost, are you hiring authors  for free?</comment>

<comment>media making mountain of molehill!!! He died of old age, his time had come!!!!</comment>

<comment>He ushered in Militancy as the Home Minister-he is as much to blame as JKLF and Hizbul</comment>

<comment>The people of Jammu voted overwhelmingly for the BJP for the first time and were sacrificied at the altar of Power by non other than Baniya Jain Shah,who aligned with an anti national.Try asking for votes next time.</comment>

<comment>He is the same guy who was responsible for anti-Hindu riots in Anantnag, Verinag and Vessu in 1986. It is was his daughter who led the 2008 secession movement against Amarnath land transfer</comment>

<comment>He is Modi's friend though</comment>
