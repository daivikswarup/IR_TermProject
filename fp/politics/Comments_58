<comment>Also respect the sentiments of the people of jammu and Ladakh, currently being considered as colonies of Kashmir due to  the stupid Article 370. The Union Territory status for Ladakh was a long-standing demand. The best solution is to make Kashmir a buffer state like Bhutan or a guarded neutrality similar to Switzerland. Scrap Article 370 and grant statehood or UT status for jammu and Ladakh. The status of Hindus in Pakistan is infinitely worse than that of the Muslims in India. So any solution that involves Hindus ending up in Pakistan is far worse than a solution involving Muslims ending up in India.</comment>

<comment>The one interesting point in this column is that J&K governor could have directly appointed Ms. Syed as CM and left it to her to decide how to get support of the House. But if she has not made a claim to the post, how can he pre-emptively appoint here? She wants to play the waiting game and the Governor is constitutionally bound to do nothing unless one or more members of the house make a formal claim to government formation.The part about Presidents / Governors reaching out to Party Bosses vs House Leaders is nonsense. As if an AIADMK or Shiv Sena House Leader would do anything without Amma's or Balasaheb's approval. What harm if President Narayanan cuts the middleman and directly reaches out to the actual decision maker? And how the hell does a President have anything to do with two party leaders deciding to vote out a govt over a private tea meeting? The author is thinking like a lawyer, professor or bureaucrat - more concerned with legal forms, procedures & theoretical constructs than the real world.</comment>

<comment>Does this guy have any idea what he is writing about. Is there any commotion here. I could not understand.</comment>

<comment>The headline covers it (albeit somewhat inaccurately), as party-bosses always will be the deciders of coalitions -- what he's actually saying is that local (aka state-level) party-bosses should be allowed to come to an agreement on their coalitions independent of the federal ones.</comment>

<comment>Interesting thoughts. When minority Govt of Devendra Fadnavis faced a similar situation it caused all kinds of chaos. Our houses should first function with decorum and members should have a say than just be slaves of their party bosses. But this cuts both ways as members at times are guided by self-interest than the interest of people.</comment>

<comment>Argumentative media!Even laymen can understand that this governor is doing the right thing unlike AP governor.</comment>

<comment>We should stop reading these anti-nationals. There is only one way forward in J&K, and I hope BJP displays the courage to proceed:1. Carve out Jammu as a separate state, and Ladakh as a Union Territory. This salvages 88 % of the land area and it can be fully integrated with India. All efforts should be made to develop these two parts.2. Stop providing any funding or support to Kashmir. Impose Army rule, black out the media and deal with the stone-pelters in the language they understand. Push them over across the border into their madre-watan, chased by dogs and bullets. No online or offline media should be allowed to write anything about Kashmir without clearance from appropriate government authorities. This will also help in dealing with Paki induced terrorism.3. Stalwarts of the award wapsi/intolerance gang who are finding India unlivable should be sent to settle in Kashmir - their properties in India should be confiscated.</comment>
