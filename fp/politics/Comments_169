<comment>Oh Pappu,Why deny it? Everyone knows that you're there, just for a photo op, nothing more, nothing less..so to "thunder about" how insulting that question was only serves to underline the validity of that question and the fact that it was spot on. What were you there for? Have you visited every single family who had a tragedy visited on them? The obvious answer is one resounding "No" but you choose to make an exception here for the simple reason you wanted to milk the corpses of those two young children for all they were worth, just so you could stand a chance of being elected again..This is why we tend to term the congress as maggot ridden carrion feeders..call us when you have stopped snacking up on corpses..</comment>

<comment>Whatever he is saying is pure 'rubbish' and drama. 1. Why did he take so many months to simply visit Karnataka, his own mother ruled state, when the farmers' deaths in Karnataka were the MAXIMUM anywhere in the country and when, in the same period, he was storming BJP and non Congress rules states for the same reason and attacking Modi for it ?    2. What probing questions did he put to his own mother's appointed Congress CM Siddaramiah and why did he not take him to task for the lapses there? 3. Was his 'padayatra' in Karnataka, which was ignored by several top Congress leaders themselves, who were present only at the start and immediately left by cars to the 'finish spot', not a photo op, which yielded NOTHING to any farmer but only publicity to him?  4. He visited Bangalore but did not care to ask why no action was being taken to alleviate the sufferings of thousands of citizens caused by the highly polluted chemical foam rising all day and night in large clouds for several weeks now out of the city's Bellandur lake, smothering road users on walk, two wheelers, autos and open transport like Buses etc?  5. Bangalore's garbage collection and disposal problem has assumed gargantuan proportions but Siddararamiah has done nothing about it, though he has seen things first hand. Villagers on the outskirts where it is dumped are suffering from the ill effects over several months. Why did this not come to Rahul's notice?</comment>

<comment>Would the fortunes of the INC change if they fielded anyone else in place of Pappu Maharaj? And not the same old goons like Sibal, Choudhary, Soni... May be someone like JM Scindia??</comment>

<comment>None of the Dalit attacks were investigated when Indra Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were prime ministers, or for that matter when Narasimha Rao and Dr. Man Mohan Singh were in power.  Now, the CBI investigates everything under Narendra Modi, and even then the opposition cries a lot accusing him.  Rahul Gandhi just does Caucasian show business and does not do anything.  He is desperately seeking power in a completely losing situation.</comment>

<comment>why no one paid attention when our king Kulibaba killed 23 children through Dengue?</comment>

<comment>was rahul helping dalit and minorities in Thailand for 2 months !!!!</comment>

<comment>truth  hurts Rahul gandhi !!!!</comment>

<comment>Why does he not visit the family of the  hindu killed because he was against cow slaughter, in Manglaore?</comment>

<comment>Dead bodies and rape victims are an opportunity for Raga and Kejriwal to come and promote their candidacies before they step back into their air conditioned cars, head back to their palaces and take a long hot shower to cleanse themselves of having to mingle with the common folk. </comment>

<comment>this incident should have been induced by congress peoplehariyana govt sent notice to vadra on the land deals recentlyhis brother in law need to give pressure to the govt and take the focus awaycreated this incident.. brother in law was stand by to visit this villagenow, entire focus is on upper caste and lower caste. vadra is relieved for some times. anyone deny??i am deeply saddened about this incident causing death of innocent young children. heart is bleeding to hear this news.no one, whether he belongs to upper caste or lower caste deny that the culprits must be punished with the maximum punishment.while most of the media is writing about the personal fude between these families, why don't they write more about the incident which caused this enmity? is it true that a year ago some of the upper caste people also killed by these people. why play caste card in all these kind of personal enmities between two individual families.then, what is wrong in rss chief arguing that the reservations must be based on economical backwardness, not on the caste. when india moves towards the great suggestion from rss chief, the castesim will  be vanished.</comment>

<comment>Why not adopt a village, make it role model? Do some constructive work instead of lip service. People will elect if some good work is done. Walk the talk.</comment>

<comment>This is sad, every issue is being politicized just to be in the limelight. What kind of help did he render? Is he visiting all the people that are dying? or only selective?</comment>

<comment>Lol! When did this guy come back to india? </comment>

<comment>Daily Mail Bureau | Mangaluru | Oct 18, 2015::  The probe into the murder of a Bajrang Dal activist in Moodbidri town of coastal Karnataka has taken an interesting turn.A local BJP leader has claimed that witnesses in the case are receiving threat calls from international mobile numbers, asking them not to testify in the case.To make matters worse for the police, the prime witness allegedly committed suicide two days ago.The murder has also taken a political angle with the BJP — which is strong in the coastal Karnataka region — alleging that the Congress government was deliberately not according importance to the incident.“It is evident that everyone is trying to hush up the case. The Congress politicians are not showing any interest in ensuring justice to the victim’s family.“Had the police shown concern, they would have arrested the culprits by now.“We are hearing that other witnesses are being threatened over phone from international mobile numbers, including Pakistani phone numbers,” said Dakshina Kannada MP (BJP) Nalin Kumar Kateel.On October 9, Prashanth Poojary (26), an active Bajrang Dal member and a flower vendor, was hacked to death by six unidentified bike-borne miscreants in Mudbidri.He had recently actively taken part in busting illegal slaughter houses and protested against cattle trafficking in the region.On October 15, prime witness Vaman Poojary (68) allegedly committed suicide at his daughter’s home.While the police claimed that he ended his life due to personal reasons, others are linking it to Prashanth’s murder.“Vaman Poojary had clearly seen the faces of the assailants who attacked Prashanth. He could have helped us in identifying the miscreants.“Unfortunately, he is no more and this has been a big blow to the probe. Nevertheless, we are confident of nabbing the killers,” a Dakshina Kannada district police officer said.The cops believe that all the six assailants have fled to Kerala. Prashanth’s cousin Dhyanesh alleged: “We have shared information about the suspects with the police.Read also: Accused in Prashanth Poojary’s murder believed to be nabbed by police“It is already a week, but we are not seeing any progress in the probe,” he said.Kateel also alleged that police already have information about the suspects, but were delaying the probe.“After Prashanth had busted the illegal slaughter house with his friends, a protest demonstration was held by a group in Moodbidri.“Addressing the protesters, their leader Haneef had vowed to take revenge against all those involved in the raid on the slaughter house.“Prashanth was killed at the same spot where the speech was made, but action has not been taken against Haneef so far.“The police should have arrested and questioned him,” the BJP leader said.Courtesy: Daily mail and the links used above.</comment>

<comment>such kind of act is not new to hariyana. but blaming the whole community for that will be foolishness. but publishinh dalit murder news in media in hariyana is new because in past decades of jat-dalit riots during hudda days, media never show the reality but suddenly they showing that. may be because of their political rival is in the goverment.</comment>

<comment>End all government funding to the humanities, the left uses out money to fund their own elections.</comment>

<comment>To call it despicable act of humans is the least polite way to express indignation. However, Rahul the idiot forgets that dalits were raped in Haryana during Hooda govt. and the state raped the farmers by selling land to Vadra.....what the F did he do then?</comment>

<comment>What happened to the dalit family is reprehensible, inhuman and a despicable crime. The perpetrators should be hounded and given exemplary punishment.Similar, crime took place in Mirchpur village of Hisar when Congress was ruling Haryana. The issue has not been settled till date. Did RaGa visit that village? No. Why? Because his own party was ruling the state. Is it not hypocrisy on his part?The media is right. He does not let go a single photo opportunity. Shame on him.</comment>

<comment>I agree with Rahul Gandhi. Its a free country and its our will to visit any one any time in happy or sad days. The media has nothing better to do other than using words like photo op, political mileage  etc, No one is asking them to follow any politicians. Did rahul Gandhi invite them . and what was the media doing there. Reporting? how many days ?reporting what? which politician is visiting and what wrong words came out of their mouth. Media report has ignited more violence than politicans visit. Arnab goswamy should shut up for few days.</comment>

<comment>Catch the culprits and let them face the full weight of the law. People behind this should not be spared.</comment>

<comment>Chaddi Desh or BJP dono ko dubane main lage hai, Desh to phir bhi bach jayega what about BJP.</comment>

<comment>your beloved .. highly intellectual ....Prince Rahul will help BJP to servive.. you dont worry</comment>

<comment>This event is unfortunate. But this has nothing to do with any political party. This is the caste system mentality of India. We have to get rid of the caste system. Even after doing that this mentality will stay for 2 generations at least and we have to be patient. There is no one-shot cure for this nonsense. Many people will say that caste system should be done with, but when someone says the caste based reservations have to go away, those same people will raise a big hue and cry over it. That is hypocrisy. Anything and everything related to caste system has to go. Caste based surnames have to be changed, caste based businesses and occupations have to be changed, children should be taught that caste system is bad and reservations should be stopped as well.</comment>

<comment>Old caste system is long gone. Money and power are the basis for caste now.Pappu has gone to accumulate power to improve his caste status.</comment>

<comment>Then BJP politicians are the new Dalits and Congress the upper cast ?</comment>

<comment>Varnas ?? Are you sure?</comment>

<comment>Yes sir. Varnas. Our friend @bigben said it is long gone. But it is still there. I see people in my ancestral village still mention dalits as Mahars (in Maharashtra) even today. But there is no hostility and no one would do what happened to this dalit family. But in this case here, we are talking about people from Haryana. It is only worse in the villages in Haryan, UP and Bihar.</comment>

<comment>Rahul Gandhi Visited for Phtops only?Ans = This is bloody hell thinking of your BJpigians...Rahul Gandhi is Princeis has birth right to rule INDIAhe has birth right to be PMhe dont Visit Muslim and Dalit deaths for photo ops.he visits there just for the secularism..Mind it communals</comment>

<comment>so that dalit was not a hindu , he was sickular was he ?  he will not visit if it had been a hindu dalit isn;t it</comment>

<comment>you are dalit .. because congress wants you to be Dalit forever.. otherwise how Rahulji will become PM? How Vadra's son will become PM?</comment>

<comment>BJP will declare the all Dalit be move to Brahmin. Then there will be parity.</comment>

<comment>You missed the satire/ point.</comment>

<comment>Who is Bramhin?</comment>

<comment>All the BJP declared Dalits.</comment>

<comment>Whom did BJP decleare Dalit?</comment>

<comment>No one. They are all Brahmin now.</comment>

<comment>How? and who is this Bramhin? Rahul Gandhi?</comment>

<comment>I think this is another stage managed event by the sickles , they want to create riots, hardly anyone bothered , In TN including the sorrier clan DK when vanities went berserk against the dalits in Dharmapuri </comment>

<comment>Dear Pappu. At least 100 Dalit families must have faced similar treatment during 10 years of UPA rule. Can you tell us how many times you visited them?</comment>

<comment>Did any BJP leader visited either ?</comment>

<comment>Yes they did.</comment>

<comment>Name incident and the leader, What about haryana where many dalits home were burned and non of national BJP leader went there.</comment>

<comment>They did. To create more tensions.</comment>

<comment>sanjeev baliyan visit such places and pacify people by telling that he will attach with 100 thousand people.</comment>

<comment>Jusl like Pappu you mean?</comment>

<comment>No. Then BJP and Congress will be same. Is it the case?</comment>

<comment>a law and order problem needs to be treated as such , not do photo -op , why is Kejriwal not visiting for the photo OP</comment>

<comment>PM visit to foreign country should remain and PM should not keep getting photographed taking selfy with everybody ask paid media to print it across media.When Modi does it is great nationalism, when other do it is photo op. What hypocrisy.</comment>

<comment>well the difference here is people want to get photographed with PM , whereas pappu wants to get photographed with a victim ( not sure what he did to the other gang , i meant the victim )no one just goes out and burns a house unless there is reason after all they are hindus and not like you who will burn a coach full of pilgrims including women and children ,to get lets say play victim for burning the coach ( everything is stage managed by sickulars and sickular media )</comment>

<comment>AAh!! Big difference.</comment>

<comment>yeah it is , maybe  not discernible by a myopic sick sickular</comment>

<comment>Modesty is the PMs strong suite. Fake Modesty.</comment>

<comment>He is so modest that he cannot speak without making grand boastful gesture with his hands, watch his election speeches without sound and you will know his character more.</comment>

<comment>What ideology is behind the thinking that weak must not speak against strong classes or else they should be punished.</comment>

<comment>Maybe the PM should start a daily show like arnab's newshour..he can comment on every daily happening..then probably everyone will be satisfied..</comment>

<comment>No he should keep getting photographed taking selfy with everybody and that is not photo op, that is great nationalism.</comment>

<comment>Agreed..say modi resigns tomorrow..who do u think should replace him as PM?</comment>

<comment>At least rahul is visiting those affected by violence, it's a show he cares. The ruling party and its PM's silence and inaction only becomes more glaring in the eyes of the common people. India is becoming intolerant and the leaders don't even care if people live or die.</comment>

<comment>rahul goes only for photoshop</comment>

<comment>media should check whether he stayed in that dalit household last time in UP, he had purified himself with gangajal</comment>

<comment>Waiting for PM oh sorry CM Kejriwal to visit the place...I actually went to 2019 for a second</comment>

<comment>Congress has again used a child for protest!!</comment>

<comment>Move on this cry baby act would not work now, Congress is gone and bucks stops with PM Modi now, or RSS if you really stretch it.</comment>

<comment>He first killed thousands in Ahemdabad now killing kids and old all over country.</comment>

<comment>lols , who papu</comment>

<comment>Pappu's father in 1984. Now pappu is organizing killings to defame the govt.</comment>

<comment>Get well soon,</comment>

<comment>ditto mate</comment>

<comment>Yes. And Rahul Gandhi killed thousands of Sikhs in Punjab and Delhi in 1984 and thousands in Bhopal in 1984 as well. He has the same blood you see. Stop making nonsensical comments.</comment>

<comment>By that standard you too have killed millions of muslim killed in partition. In eighty four he was kid. Congress and Rajiv Gandhi is certainly responsible for that.</comment>

<comment>He first looted the common man's tax money. Now he is eating the poor man's food</comment>

<comment>Why Rahul Gandhi visited the place where if Muslim or Dalit Dies?Ans = He is true secular, and communalizm is non of his business...</comment>

<comment>Moron bakths wont help others and they don't want other to do that.simple ..I won't eat and I won't let you eat also..that's their ideology.. Stupid thugs</comment>

<comment>This is the most open and interesting Sonia bakth I have ever seen! He is openly advocating eating and letting his friends eat!</comment>

<comment>he is talking about eating dal and onion, which your leader is not allowing the common man to eat. :)</comment>

<comment>Look at the news on steps taken ..but u are opiniated so no point</comment>

<comment>and if you do not know that this govt, despite advance warning, did nothing till the last moment, and that too very little, you clearly neither have the correct information nor have an opinion of your own.</comment>

<comment>These morons do not believe that one of them is running the nation now, they are still cursing past. These cry baby will always cry.</comment>

<comment>Why could the Congress party not better the state of the scheduled caste people even after ruling the country for sixty years? Other countries like China and Singapore have moved miles ahead in fostering social equality. We should not have been in a position to worry about such issues today if the Congress had focused on the real welfare of the lower caste people and minorities. But the fellows were busy making money.</comment>

<comment>Why did Prince Pappu not yell when lakhs of crores of Rupees belonging to the poor in India was swindled by by Congress men?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>He is better than fekku</comment>

<comment>Really ????</comment>

<comment>So, sahebzada is back. Rest, recuperation ho gayaa? Prince tires fast</comment>

<comment>Pappu is in the kindergarten as far as politics is concerned. Please allow him a lot more time to grow up!</comment>

<comment>hailaaa..........................pappu bolta v hai !!!!!</comment>

<comment>lol...thunders!!!!...whatever that is supposed to mean!!!! he yelled at a loyal servant of his (media) for not sticking to the script...maybe media can use this for another 'relaunch' of their dear, beloved, lovable, cutie pie Rahul...thats alll...nothing more..nothing less...</comment>

<comment>Well said - loyal servant indeed !</comment>

<comment>Bloody creep,  like kejriwal always doing photo ops b4 pushing off to foreign holidays</comment>

<comment>Still better than fekku</comment>

<comment>Maybe for you</comment>

<comment>why did Rahul Baby not go to Karnataka where an anti slaughter activist was killed by cattle smugglers? Because the murderers were from his favourite community (vote bank) and the poor guy who died was from another community. No compensation from Karnataka 'secular' Govt., no 50 lacks and flats like in Dadri??</comment>

<comment>Rahul gandhi ur rape case of sukanya devi shud be reopened, she was also a dalit</comment>

<comment>Now please don't return the lemon-spoon consolation award for protesting this insult</comment>

<comment>Pyare Pappu, there is another great photo opportunity waiting for you in Mangalore and fortunately your own government is in power there ! Please fly down and meet the family of Prashant Poojary, and tell your CM to emulate Akhilesh - announce compensation of Rs 45 lakhs + 4 flats + government jobs for the family ! Kya hua ... phat gayi ?</comment>

<comment>Prashant Poojary was a Bajrang Dal Terrorist.</comment>

<comment>You declare him a terrorist, so his murder is OK. Since the whole world considers Muslims to be terrorists, we can apply your "logic" and declare that the murder of any Muslim is perfectly fine.</comment>

<comment>Well said..</comment>

<comment>LOLs! Thunders...LOLsWhy is he so nervous when people say the truth. Maybe he gets a complex that people can speak without referring to notes!</comment>

<comment>Yes, if MODI take selfie with NAWAS SHERIF, CHINESE PREMIER, OBAMA ETC ETC it's in the great interest of the nation and it's new lessons in diplomacy . If Rahul visit villages, it's photo ops. Alas, after a year as PM, India's relation with most of the neighbouring countries in its worst phase . MODI goes to America , take selfies and come back . Next day America talk about helping PAK to build nuclear reactor. Super logic bhakts  </comment>

<comment>Stupid bakths..don't expect more from them..bunch of idiots</comment>

<comment>People these days know only trivializing a grave issue. It doesn't occur to them if the same misfortune happens to them and people make silly remarks. We have really become only chattering classes. I am ashamed of all including myself as it is easier to give a comment than make a constructive contribution.</comment>

<comment>Today farmers suicides are happening.Now suicide is coming up for not being able to pay EMIs.Is there any politicians to visit them?</comment>

<comment>Do you know the difference between people dying because of their religion/caste and those because of the wrong economic policies/monsoon failure? Both are deaths but one is done in a fit of raze by a supposedly upper caste. Have a little commonsense.</comment>

<comment>Do U justify  death because of economic reasons?Then why there is queue for farmers death? Is this only for vote bank politics?</comment>

<comment>Bravo, Pappu ! But no time to rest, my dear ! In Karnataka, your government has arrested 8 innocent Muslim youth just because they brutally murdered some Hindu fellow - please rush there, get them released and also visit their families to understand their trauma. But make sure to stay clear of the family of a certain Poojary !</comment>

<comment>most stupid statement. You yourself have said that the Karnataka govt has arrested those murderers. It was a dastardly act and the guilty should be hanged. At least, Congress leaders did not say it was an accident. A complaint was given to the police just 2 days before this incident happened in Haryana and the police were supposed to guard the family.</comment>

<comment>Please read my other comment above, and check with your Chhote Maalik whether he is willing to announce a compensation for Prashant Poojary ?</comment>

<comment>unlike you, i do not have any maalik. Also, did Rahul Gandhi announce any compensation here or in Dadri?</comment>

<comment>Isnt your Malik a ped0phile who thinks anyone who doesnt believe in him is an infidel that should be killed?</comment>

<comment>once again, i do not have a malik and am surprised to hear this from someone whose malik snooped on women who caught his fancy.</comment>

<comment>The CM did. And you Dirty Congi's still have a few CMs left - one of whom is in Karnataka !</comment>
