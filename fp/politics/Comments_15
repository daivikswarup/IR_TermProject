<comment>RSS corrected it's mistake. But media is hell-bent on making it an issue. They are just inciting some RSS worker to talk about replacing national flag with saffron flag, so they can make a bigger news.</comment>

<comment>Sandipan Sharma is flat liar. Tricolor was never a national flag till it was decided after setting Ashok Chakra. It was tricolor with Cotton spinner in white color was Congress flag which flying even today on Congress offices. Thuggish quality writers just twisting the truth!</comment>

<comment>All the shameless English media is fully exposed along with Communists and Congress Party. RSS is registered as cultural organisation and has no business use National Flag. For every Govt action all these stooges find faults.</comment>

<comment>Randeepan is now asking a govt minister about rss? Shame on these ppl. Anything to divert...</comment>

<comment>Why does the writer of this piece of crap so much trouble with flying the national flag.  Just because RSS did not fly the National flag many years ago does not mean one should not be flown now.  By that logic there was no electricity 100 years ago in India so the writer must not use electricity.</comment>

<comment>Child sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church: It's a Crime“”For the first time in this country, a report into child sexual abuse exposes an attempt by the Holy See to frustrate an inquiry in a sovereign, democratic republic as little as three years ago, not three decades ago. And in doing so, [we excavate] the dysfunction, the disconnection, the elitism that dominate the culture of the Vatican today...I want to make it clear, as Taoiseach, that when it comes to the protection of the children of this State, the standards of conduct which the Church deems appropriate to itself, cannot and will not, be applied to the workings of democracy and civil society in this republic. Not purely, or simply, or otherwise, because children have to be, and will be, put first.—Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny, who was later nearly excommunicated“”When Jesus said, 'Suffer the little children, come unto me,' that's not what he was talking about. —George CarlinFor what you are about to receive...Child sexual abuse perpetrated by priests appears to have a long history within Christianity, and is especially associated with the Roman Catholic Church, due to a number of high profile scandals which have come to light in recent decades.Many of these scandals relate to molestations committed decades ago, which were hushed up by the Church at the time. This hushing up included pressurising abuse victims into silence, a practice supported by Church decrees such as the Crimen sollicitationis. This culture of secrecy and self-preservation is one of the factors which has allowed paedophiles to remain active within the clergy, together with the tradition of clerical celibacy which may attract those who cannot satisfy their sexual proclivities openly, and priests' frequent access to children in the pastoral duties.</comment>

<comment>What’s the State of the Church’s Child Abuse Crisis?FEBRUARY 25, 2014 / by SARAH CHILDRESS Senior Digital Reporter, FRONTLINE Enterprise Journalism GroupThe first report that church officials received about Father Shawn Ratigan, compiled by a Kansas City Catholic school principal in May 2010, was troubling.Ratigan had taken hundreds of photographs of children, Julie Hess, the principal, wrote to church officials. He had tried to interact with kids on Facebook, and sometimes had physical contact with children in ways that appeared to other adults to be “boundary violations.”A pair of girl’s underwear was found in a planter in his backyard.Parents and staff, Hess said, were “discussing whether he is a child molester.”Bishop Robert Finn, who had authority over Ratigan, didn’t alert the police then, according to court documents. (Finn would later say he had only received a verbal summary of the letter from a deputy at the time.) He also didn’t call the police several months later, when a computer technician found hundreds of lewd photos of children on Ratigan’s laptop, most of which appeared to have been taken by a personal camera.Instead, the laptop was turned over to the diocesan lawyer, and Finn called a psychiatrist, who said he thought he could help with Ratigan’s “severe loneliness that has caused this problem.”In the meantime, as subsequent civil lawsuits would show, Ratigan continued to take photographs of young girls’ genitals.Ratigan was arrested in May 2011 for possession of child pornography. He pleaded guilty to five counts of producing or attempting to produce child pornography, and was sentenced to 50 years in prison.Finn, who argued in court that because others in the diocese were tasked with reporting abuse he didn’t have a legal obligation to do so, was convicted in 2012 for failing to report Ratigan to the police, and given two years’ probation.He is still the bishop of the Kansas City-St. Joseph diocese, in good standing with the Catholic Church.That, say former priests and victims’ advocates, represents the state of the sexual abuse crisis in the Catholic Church today. More than three decades after the initial reports of abuse began to emerge, critics say that many bishops, who have authority over their areas of responsibility, known as dioceses or eparchies, seem more committed to protecting the church than preventing abuse.The Vatican defrocked nearly 400 priests from 2011-2012 who abused children, according to Vatican figures. But while several bishops have resigned in connection with sex abuse scandals, of those who ignored offenders’ behavior or even intervened to protect them, a scant few have been otherwise disciplined by the Vatican.“That’s the crux of the crisis,” said David Clohessy, the national director of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, a victims’ advocacy group. If the bishops have impunity, he said, “there’s no incentive for them to reform. It’s not even in their self-interest to reform.”The Scope of the CrisisIt’s difficult to estimate the full scope of the abuse crisis. While allegations first surfaced in the U.S., the problem has become a global one, with widespread reports of abuse emerging in Ireland, Spain, Germany, Italy, Latin America and elsewhere.In the U.S. alone, 16,787 people have come forward to say that they were abused by priests as children between 1950 and 2012, according to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the organization for the Catholic hierarchy in the country. Those figures are incomplete. The data excludes, for unclear reasons, any people who came forward in 2003.  The conference also counts only allegations it determined were “not implausible” or “credible.”Each diocese determines on its own whether an allegation is credible. A recent investigation of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis by MPR News found that after adopting a rule barring abusive priests from the ministry, officials raised the burden of proof for credible allegations. “Church officials created difficult, vague and shifting criteria for an allegation to be deemed credible,” the MPR investigation found, noting that church officials dismissed some cases because the people seemed “too angry to be believed.”To senior church officials, the pattern of allegations, the bulk of which emerged in 1970s and 1980s, suggests that the abuse crisis is winding down. “The peak of the curve is not moving forward or broadening as time goes on,” said Al Notzon III, a layperson and chair of the conference’s National Review Board, which is charged with helping to oversee the U.S. church’s efforts to protect children, at a 2012 presentation to U.S. bishops.Victims’ advocates say it will take time to determine whether the crisis is subsiding, since most victims don’t report abuse until they’re adults. Either way, said Patrick Wall, a former priest and victims’ attorney, the hundreds of new allegations that arise each year are still cause for concern.What the Church Has DoneWhen the first allegations in the U.S. emerged in 1985, the Conference brushed off advice to take proactive steps to confront them.“They made it clear that they did not think this was a problem,” Fr. Tom Doyle, a canon lawyer, told FRONTLINE. Doyle worked with another priest, Fr. Michael Peterson, and attorney Ray Mouton, to draw up guidelines for handling the crisis. Their manual recommended reporting allegations to civil authorities and cooperating fully with police.The men mailed a copy to every bishop in the country at their own expense. But ultimately the Conference chose not to implement the guidelines.“They were still operating under the belief that they could use their stature, the deference that they were accustomed to receiving from the American society … in controlling what they did not see to be a potential bombshell,” Doyle said.Nearly two decades later in 2002, after The Boston Globe broke a series of stories detailing a broader crisis, the public backlash forced the church to confront the problem. The Conference founded a committee dedicated to protecting children, and established a charter with guidelines to prevent abuse and deal with allegations.Most of the guidelines were similar to what Doyle, Mouton and Peterson had proposed in their 1985 manual, including reporting all allegations to the police and cooperating with investigations. Today, allegations are also supposed to be forwarded to a review board appointed by the bishop. The board reviews the evidence and makes recommendations on whether or how to discipline the offender.“Perhaps the most important advancement for the church in the last decade is a realization of its leaders that cooperation with legal authorities is in the best interest of the church,” Notzon, the review board chair, said during his 2012 presentation.Notzon said that most dioceses now follow that procedure, but acknowledged that not all do. “Those few cases that are not reported [to the police] quickly become news,” he said. “The harm that can be done to children — and at a distant second, the negative publicity that results — should serve as reminder to all of how important it is to follow canon law, diocesan policy and state law.”The Conference didn’t respond to an email and phone call seeking a comment on its handling of the crisis.The Cost of the CrisisWhen Doyle and his colleagues wrote their manual in 1985, they warned that abuse allegations could cost the Catholic Church $1 billion over 10 years if it failed to act. By 2012, nearly two decades later, it had spent more than $2.6 billion in civil suits in the U.S. alone, including therapy costs for victims and the price of defending the alleged abusers, according to the Conference.The tally is likely to rise. In Minnesota last year, the state legislature passed a law lifting the civil statute of limitations for child victims of sexual abuse, clearing the way for more lawsuits. This month, the archdiocese of Los Angeles settled with 17 people who said they’d been abused as children by a priest or other church employees, for $13 million. The Kansas City diocese has so far spent $3.75 million to settle civil suits against Ratigan. There are two more civil suits pending against Ratigan.A Problem for the New PopeCritics of the Catholic Church say that recalcitrant bishops have taken their cues from Rome.“Every action taken by every bishop and archbishop and cardinal in connection with sexual abuse is effective orchestrated and controlled by the Vatican,” said Jeff Anderson, a victims’ attorney in St. Paul, Minn. “Every action taken has demonstrated to us that all roads lead to Rome and to the Vatican and to the papacy. And it is the papacy that has made the decisions historically and to the present to make sure that scandal is to be avoided.”A year into his papacy, Pope Francis has suggested some willingness to confront the problem. Last year, he amended Vatican law to specify sexual violence against children as a crime and set up a committee in the Vatican to make recommendations for addressing the crisis.But the Vatican also declined to cooperate with an investigation by the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child, which found that, when it came to child abuse, “the Holy See has consistently placed the preservation of the reputation of the church and the protection of the perpetrators above children’s best interests.” Archbishop Silvano Tomasi, the Vatican’s observer at the U.N., said the report didn’t reflect recent progress in addressing the crisis.The Vatican also recently refused to extradite Jozef Wesolowski, a Polish archbishop who has been accused of sexually abusing teenage boys in Poland and the Dominican Republic, and is believed to be living in the Vatican.“That’s on this pope,” said SNAP’s Clohessy. “He’s obviously a likeable, warm, humble, compassionate man. But many of us who were molested can say the very same thing about the priests who molested us, and the bishops who rebuffed us. … It takes not symbolic action, but real courage to say, ‘I’m demoting you, or kicking you out, because you put kids in harm’s way.’”Meanwhile, back in the U.S., more than 100,000 Catholics in Kansas City signed a petition asking the pope to initiate an investigation to determine whether Finn violated church law when he failed to take action on Ratigan.Earlier this month they received a letter from a papal representative, telling them the letter had been forwarded on to the Holy See.</comment>

<comment>While the world is suffering from Vatican abuses Indian media like Sandipan and others want to divert the attention of our national flag not at RSS premise. Do you know even Sonia's house does not have national flag. Is it because she is Italian citizen?-------------Christian Church sexual abuse casesThe Christian Church sexual abuse cases are a series of 20th-21st century cases of child sexual abuse crimes (and subsequent cover-ups) committed by Christian priests, nuns, and members of Christian Church. The numerous abuses, investigations, trials and convictions include crimes against boys and girls, some as young as 3 years old, with the majority between the ages of 11 and 14. The accusations began to receive wide publicity in the late 1980s. Many relate to cases in which a figure abused for decades; such allegations were frequently made by adults or older youths years after the abuse occurred. Cases have also been brought against members of the Christian hierarchy who covered up sex abuse allegations, moving allegedly abusive priests to other parishes, where abuse sometimes continued. Even pope knew about it but covered it up.The cases received significant media and public attention throughout the world, especially in Ireland, Canada, and the United States. A series of television documentaries in the 1990s, such as "Suffer the children" (UTV, 1994), brought the issue to national attention in Ireland. A critical investigation by The Boston Globe in 2002 led to widespread media coverage of the issue in the United States, which was dramatized in the 2015 film Spotlight. By 2010, much of the reporting focused on abuse in Europe.From 2001 to 2010 the Holy See, the central governing body of the Catholic Church, considered sex abuse allegations concerning about 3,000 priests dating back up to fifty years. Cases worldwide reflect patterns of long-term abuse, and the church hierarchy regularly covering up reports of alleged abuse. Diocesan officials and academics knowledgeable about the Church say that sexual abuse by clergy is generally not discussed, and thus is difficult to measure. In the Philippines, where as of 2002 at least 85% of the population is Catholic, revelations of child sexual abuse by priests followed the United States' reporting in 2002.Why not a single case not reported in India? How long can the Christian Church funded media and the media hide it or suppress it?</comment>

<comment>Sandipan, do you know:1. Sonia Gandhi was an Italian Citizen for 15 years in India?2. Sonia Gandhi as an Italian Spy-Citizen lived in TOP SECRET PM House of India for 15 years.3. Do you know Sonia Gandhi lives in a bigger house than PM of India...just below the size of the house of President of India and VP of India even though she is just a barmaid and an MP.4. Do you know Sonia Gandhi's house does not have a TriColour Flag of India at her house?5. Do you know CPM does not hoist Indian flag at their office in Delhi?6. Do you know Congress party does not have a flag of India at their office in India or anywhere.7. Do you know Raoul Gandhu has many citizenships?8. Do you know RSS has nothing to do with Smriti Irani but you continue to go after RSS?9. Do you know Vatican is the world's biggest Child Molester organization and more Christian Padre/priests have been put in jail in 100 countries for molesting children and still not a single case in India? How long can you not bring out the news of child molestation by Christian padre/priests in India? How long can you suppress the news?10. Do you know 99.9999% of terrorists are muslims?11.

<comment>all tri colour cloth r indian flag dear.. there is a ashoka chakra on our national flag .......and have some rules !!! dont be idiot !! always !!</comment>

<comment>What is wrong with only saffron colour of our flag.???Sandy, why does it bother you.Having  fun with inflaming communal passions?Planning to visit families of 76 police officers murdered by your ilk?</comment>

<comment>So.</comment>

<comment>RSS true colour exposed. Good job sanddeepan</comment>

<comment>What has this to do with RSS and good job? This is like saying Pope is always a white man so Christians are racist and bigots. Or if all suicide bombers are Muslims so Islam is the reason. Or some stupid analogy you want to say like AK kicked out Anna and Prashant Bhushanji and others are his colours exposed</comment>

<comment>Because they are fake nationalists. They want to amend the tricolour to make it a single colour. So simple</comment>

<comment>Really? You mean to say muslims or commies like you who will turn this into Green or Red? Wow....</comment>

<comment>I had coined a term for the likes of you - selfie patriots. Credit that word to me in future in case you want to introduce yourself. What  is that? A professional mourner, ready to wail and rant with imagined threats/ disasters in order to whip up public sympathy like a prima donna. From one act to the other, you will make different mimes. But the repertoire will wear of soon that you don't realize.</comment>

<comment>Very nice rajen. Excellent</comment>

<comment>We have enough of these drama queens my friend. Their exaggerated show will put the eunuchs to shame. really disgusting! As if they are the only ones who are patriots.</comment>

<comment>While you coin terms and blow hot air I don't need to coin anything for you as you are just a plain terrorist not less.</comment>

<comment>Because you have very little imagination and you are just like the Bolywood character that acts much more than needed. Watch a Hollywood movie - see a funeral scene. How calm and dignified all behave. See our movies! The actors compete in wailing and shouting  throughout. So no need to flash your patriotism. If you are a true patriot then use a khadi condom. Ok?</comment>

<comment>And did Sandipan know that the flag act prevented hoisting of flag by the public except on 3 days in the year? It was Vajpayee's government that changed that in 2002 after which the RSS started hoisting the flag.</comment>

<comment>Shall I be blunt? Then here it is - by bringing the gunda culture respectable. By making nastiness and abusive a part of your culture. By leaving there no room for any discussion but through sheer brute force. Thats it.</comment>

<comment>Why don't you catch those culprits instead of catching the more meek and defenceless? And we all agree that there have been such cases on both sides. But to be so militant about it and making a culture where you have stopped respecting seniors, women, farmers (fashionable to commit suicide?). You have brought in a  terror regime.But in case you do not know, let me tell you that Robespierre and his colleagues who had almost choreographed the guillotine culture after the revolution were themselves guillotined. So do not overtly support such a militant behaviour. Let the culprits be tried in court and due punishment be given. You must not go out and lead a mob. One fine day one will just drag you out of your home and shout "Chor! Chor!" That is sufficient for the mob to come for your blood. They will ask no questions.</comment>

<comment>SorryThanks to people like you courts are overloaded.People like you know that,and use and abuse our tolerant dharmic society.you will be exposed everyday.The internet is a wonderful thing</comment>

<comment>Elsewhere in the world, people try to evolve. Why are you trying to go backwards in time? Think of an intelligent democracy like Denmark or New Zealand and you are trying to take us to be another Saudi Arabia or a North Korea? It is a redundant ideology you are seeking. had it be within my powers, I would eradicate not only fundamentalism but religion itself!</comment>

<comment>Yep...Islam Bhakt you mean right with Nehru stolen name Gandhi family sychopants Bhakts right? I read that Jinnah said muslims cannot live with Hindus in Lahore declarations. And then muslims united under Jinnah and broke India colluding with Nehru. Now you tell me you want to set aside the facts and just come up with your false justification?</comment>

<comment>You know what? Given a chance Id like to wipe all religions from this earth!!! Stupid incantations and myths to hide your lack of analysis and analogy. believe in sorcery/heaven/jannat oh lalala</comment>

<comment>India. The name of our country is India. Unless you want to start telling everybody in the world that it's Hindustan. Go to UN and ask for a name change.We are Indians.</comment>

<comment>Yes I tried. I went to UN to change our name to Italian territory on the basis of my mistress Soniaji instructions who told me to call all Indians as brown naukars of Italian barmaid</comment>

<comment>The height of stupidity. Even after seating in power (through fraudulent means by taking people for a ride) you still see hallucinations.)</comment>

<comment>Yep....hallucinations are better than spreading terror or hatred like you are doing.</comment>

<comment>It is better to call a cat a cat than make people believe it was a tiger! You excel in that art form by the way!!!!</comment>

<comment>What ever. You excel in spreading hatred using the freedom of speech given to you by this democracy where Hindus are in majority. </comment>

<comment>Why should  I go to UN?We kicked out the British invaders,Why would we keep a name given by them?Ceylon is now Sri Lanka,Burma is not MyammarWhy should we not take back our name?</comment>

<comment>The name India was given to our land by British invaders.  British Ceylon is free Sri LankaBritish Burma is free Myammar Ate still ruled by the British?</comment>

<comment>If a party X forces you to fly the national flag on your home then defacto that party = a nationalist / patriotic party. This is why Smriti Irani ordered it. Now our tricolor is the symbol and property of BJP, and effectively there is no national flag left. Smriti Irani is government, not just BJP, you may say; but for her to order this during JNU crisis shows the sinister purpose. I was in love with our tricolor, but now I see it is an imposition of an oppressive government. I was not in love with congress but since BJP came to power my respect for our government, parliament, and tiranga are fizzling out. Except for a very few Kashmir or Khalistan or NE separatists we never had anti-nationals in the mainstream; but BJP's actions are converting millions like me to "anti-nationals". We are very diverse country in cultures, and this BJP and its supporters are strangling our unity, which has been our identity, strength and pride.</comment>

<comment>So called Ravi, lets use your logic and extend it. So if the PM of India is from BJP, PM is the head of the government and if the government tells you to celebrate Independence day on 15th August = BJP ordered you to celebrate independence day and hence you blame BJP. Wow.Is JNU property of you or commies? JNU is funded by people Indian tax payers who elected the government and if the government pays 3 lacs per student per year at JNU and it is a public property they can ask to fly national flag. What is wrong with it? Did the government ask you to put a national flag at your private property even if you dont recognize the sovereignty of India and you like China or White skin more than Indians?Sinister purpose my foot. You are a moron of the highest order. What JNU crisis can you please tell me? You are telling me that at a public university which is funded by the government to the tune of 99.9999% and 3 lacs is spent per student per year so that they only pay 30 rupees per month so that they can study and be the next generation of the India's educated elite, you are telling me that they also have a right to raise slogans to destroy India in the name of freedom of speech and question the hanging of a terrorist Afjzal Guru even though he killed people, he attacked the highest seat of democracy called Parliament and he went through the due process of judiciary and even the President of India who is an exCongressman didnt find merit in his mercy petition and he was hanged. How do you question that at a public property that does not belong to these students? How are BJP's actions converting millions like you to anti-nationals when you are lying here and you are an anti-national to start with as it clearly shows you have no locus standing but to spread hatred and lies. What facts do you have except to destroy the facts I gave and come up with some lies to justify your hatred? How is BJP and it's supporters who voted majority in a democracy strangling your unity or is it that you cannot handle the majority view in a democracy and you want to brutally impose your Italian views?</comment>

<comment>RSS national executive member K Suryanarayana Rao told reporters in Bangalore that RSS did not biannually hoist the flag because till a few days ago, there were stringent rules restricting the hoisting of the flag only on government buildings. Now that the rules have been relaxed, we will also hoist the flag...This is included in the article...so why so brouhaha...this is logic enough...</comment>

<comment>why doesnt rss fly tricolour in its shakas, since their formation till now? why only bhagwadwaj? let them give the same respect to the tricolour. why are they behaving like anti nationals by not hoisting tricolour?</comment>

<comment>Because until 2002, the flag act placed severe restrictions on when and where the flag could be hoisted</comment>

<comment>Ha ha. Idiot. </comment>

<comment>No you are the idiot here.</comment>

<comment>Till 2002, you cannot fly national flag 24 hours a day, you cannot do this or that were the norms. Naveen Jindal put a very big flag at his plant and went to court. Courts said he can hoist the national flag anytime not just on 15th August and so on and he can hoist it 24 hours a day does not need to bring it down during sunset. These were the rules. Now you want to just bend these rules and create your own rumors then you are more than welcome to since nothing else is expected from commies like so called Pratap or fundamentalist like Light Divine.</comment>

<comment>So RSS registered case against citizens for hoisting National Flag within the country ?. Harassed citizens for 12 years ? LOL no doubt their supports are such low IQ dimwits</comment>

<comment>So you bombed all over the world in the name of Islam and you justify it in the name of Koran?</comment>

<comment>Mr Modi said .... aap mujhe 60 manine dijiye .... ache din aayenge ...... 20 Months almost over .... 70 % Indians still below poverty line .... 70% means almost 80 + crore Indians ..... 80 crore indians income not more than 5000 per month per family almost 1000 per person per month</comment>

<comment>1 usd = 68.73 inr, where did economy revive? its on a downfall after feku came to power!!!!!!!why doesnt paid media highlight this?</comment>

<comment>Moron of the highest order...no wonder your IQ is light.</comment>

<comment>You do not have the knowledge to comment of foreign currency related questions. In fact 9 people out of 10 do not. But it is typical of Indian. An India will talk loudest, if his brain is empty.</comment>

<comment>Your excuses will not carry you far enough. Just watch out. The mime will have to end sooner or later. you realize that the better. I do not want the Congress to come, but some other will have to come to prevent this country from getting ruined by uncouths that you seem to be cheering for..</comment>

<comment>Really so called Rajen? You also watch out. We watched enough for 60 years India being divided, riots after riots, elite people like you questioning the sovereignty of India, and hidden inside you is trying to bring back the Italian barmaid or Chinese commies just because of your lust for foreigners.</comment>

<comment>You hardly have any stamina my dear. Reinvent yourself or you are about to fizzle out now...</comment>

<comment>Commander K.V. Singh of the Flag Foundation of India, which provided the Connaught Place flag, said the pole was made of high tension steel and cost between Rs 1.25 crore and Rs 1.35 crore. The flag, made of knitted polyester in Mumbai, cost Rs  65,000, he said.The prices of steel in India have increased by about 20 per cent since the Connaught Place flag was installed. Taking Rs 1.25 crore — the lower limit — as the benchmark, a pole of the same dimensions will now cost around Rs 1.5 crore.The Connaught Place flag is illuminated at night by eight 1000-Watt lights, Singh said. Assuming the lights burn from 8pm to 6am — 10 hours — they will consume 80,000Wh (Watt-hour)  or 80 electricity units a day. Over a month, they consume 2,400 units.With New Delhi’s power tariff slabs — among the lowest in the country — the electricity charges for the lights work out to Rs 17,870 a month, and Rs  214,440 (2.14 lakh) a year.India has 40 central universities. The total one-time expenditure on the poles to mount the Tricolour at central universities will be around Rs 60 crore (Rs 1.5 crore x 40).Assuming that the costs of the cloth and of stitching have remained the same since 2014, 40 flags would cost Rs 26 lakh. With New Delhi’s power tariff slabs, emulating the lighting around the Connaught Place flag  will cost Rs 86 lakh (Rs 214,440 x 40). In all, replicating the Connaught Place Tricolour at the 40 central universities will cost at the least Rs 61.12 crore in the first year, leaving aside maintenance.The cost will go up dramatically if the decision is extended to other centrally funded higher education institutions that will admit students this year. Such  institutions include 22 Indian Institutes of Technology, 21 Indian Institutes of Management, 30 National Institutes of Technology and eight Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research — 81 technical institutions.The total cost of installing similar flags in all these centrally funded higher education institutions, including the 40 central varsities, will come to Rs 185 crore in the first year.WHAT Rs 185cr CAN DO OTHERWISE• Fund full scholarships for all IIT students for two years — with some cash left in the kitty. (The student fees are Rs 90,000 a year at present, and the IITs admit just under 10,000 students each year)• Pay almost the entire Rs 195-crore annual budget for skill-based higher education, including community colleges, one of the Prime Minister’s pet projects• Pay three-fourths of the central government’s entire higher education scholarship budget — Rs 243 crore last year• Fund, with a few crores to spare, the central government’s total annual budget of Rs 180 crore on information and communication technology at all universities and colleges• Provide more than one-and-a-half times the Rs 112-crore budget allocation last year for the Indira Gandhi National Open University, which boasts 4 million students at present and is India’s largest engine of access to higher education.</comment>

<comment>Your illogical logic can be further extended. We the Indians (except Paki like you) celebrate August 15th as our independence day. Government spends about 500 crores on celebrating this day. We the Indians except the Pakis and Italians and others who dont believe in the sovereignty of India celebrate India's Republic day where the government spends about 1000 crores. We need BAN all of this as per your logic. You know what these 1500 crores can do for India?Instead of we spend 20,000 crores on sending Muslims to Haj. WHY? No other country sends or pays for muslims no majority muslim Indonesia or Pakistan no muslim minority like France no other country except stupid Hindu majority India waste money on these muslims to fly to Mecca. No other relgion no Hindu no Christian no Buddhist no Jain no Sikh no Atheist no commie (for China) gets paid to go anywhere. WHY?We have spent more than 1 Billion dollars on sending muslims to Haj from 1947. Do you know what can it do that for India? It is a total waste of Indian tax payers money. Do you know most of that money goes for flying on Saudia (saudi arabian airlines) and for food and for shelter and so on. Even Koran says you have to pay from your own pocket but muslims conveniently forget that when it comes to stealing money from Indian tax payers but when it comes to blowing themselves up to get 72 virgins or getting multiple wives they quote Koran. Wah allah!</comment>

<comment>Firstpost has problem with tricolor also!!!.  Why all the nonsense is written unrelated to the decision of unfurling the flag. Its a good decision for ever indian and firstpost wants to showcase it as a RSS vs tricolor issue. This republic RSS unfurled tricolor in 1500 madarsas but you wont show or quote it bcz as a faithful dog you have a duty towards ur owner scamgress   REALLY PATHETIC. !!!</comment>

<comment>oh really, i would like to see rss fly the tricolor in all their shakas along with their bhagawadwajs, untill then rss is anti national to me</comment>

<comment>the entire focus of congress, nitish kumar, left, kejriwal is not allow a democratically elected government with people mandate  to function and take steps of develpoment such as development of agriculture , industry , modernistaion of military , tax reform  GST, improvement of healtchcare , imorvement in transportation such as the waterways development bill etc. by supporting pathetic issues like suicide of rohith vemula the supporter of yakub memon , kanhiya kumar and umar khalid the terrorist afzal guru the terrorist congress, kejriwal and left have shown their true colours and proved them to be anti nationals . in 2019 people will take revenge and not give any vote to congress , kejriwal and left and the same history will be repeated in 2024 and 2029 no votes for congress , left and kejriwal.Shame on these people when we have such wolves in sheep skin in india itself we do not need china or pakistan as enemies we have many enemies in the form of congress, kejriwal and left</comment>

<comment>The Indian Flag belongs to Indians as a whole and encouraged to flown and if someone resists, they have to be punished.  India has come to this stage of a loose ended nation because of this gap.  The Indian Anthem, Flag should be given high priority to keep the patriotism embedded in the children.  Else there will be people talking against the country if that is missing.  There should be no interpretations as far as India's dignity is concerned.</comment>

<comment>it would be true if you are a pro-terrorist.</comment>

<comment>Extremely stupid and silly article. Of course, the RSS supported the Bhagwa Dhwaj to be our national flag. So? Many people in the INA had preferred the Vande Mataram to be the national anthemBUT, once it was decided that the national flag was the tricolor, and the national anthem was the Jan Gan Mana, the matter was settledJust like temples hoist the saffron flag, mosques hoist the green flag, and different organizations have different flags, so also the RSS hoists the Bhagwa DhwajRSS is not a government institution. No one is saying that one cannot have ones symbol. Where is the clash????But, as far as national institutions are concerned, government institutions are concerned, anything concerned with the country as a whole, of course it is only the national flag and the RSS has always honored it. Sandipan Sharma loves twisting facts and figures, and giving his own crooked interpretation.</comment>

<comment>I am confused... why is there even a discussion regarding the topic....I am not a BJP supporter and This decision was taken by the VC of the instituions unanimously ...What exactly is the problem here... I fail to understand...</comment>

<comment>In britain, the flag flies on every court, every govt building and every university, even famous shopping malls.</comment>

<comment>In every school, in people's porches, on lapels of jackets, people even wear it as underwear....so??? Are they more patriotic than I am? I think we are attaching too much importance to an inane thing. Patriotism is in one's heart. Not how you display it.</comment>

<comment>Look at the shame of Indian Ocholocracy[mob rule] in comparison to American Democracy where the state protects a person wishing to burn the USA flag.Legal robbers of Socialism and murderers of merit , both Individual rights of the great Indian Ocholocracy[mob rule] is trying to find fault with RSS. Sandiapn how the flavour of shoe polish which you might have lickkked during emergency?</comment>

<comment>It is a crime to burn US flag.  This constitutional amendment was done during the time of senior H.W. Bush's presidency.  </comment>

<comment>Bush was no wimp like democrats - now it is not crime.  THAT IS THE REASON USA PEOPLE LOVE THEIR FLAG.</comment>

<comment>not any more. You can burn the flag in US."The Supreme Court declared on June 11, 1990, that laws against desecrating the flag are unconstitutional"http://time.com/3907444/flag-supreme-court-history/</comment>

<comment>Fact is fact my dear | if you cant change fact, it is baseless/brainless to argue ..</comment>

<comment>When a person scores above 94% and another gets same seat for 49% in an EXAMINATION when the examiners dont know the examinees then merit does not exist because it has been murdered. A person who was murdered did exist. So also merit.That is the argument of relative morality of Mixed economy, a fascist economy - because measure and morals is a product of ones upbringing they dont exist. What is only moral is what the Constitution and mafia politicians laws state.Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim’s gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of money taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials and mafia politicians.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, but that it cannot be used honestly.Why does not the state allot a seat strictly on merit and snatch it away OPENLY?</comment>

<comment>Bhakti is good after you know the INEVITABLE effects of reservation policy[murder of Individual right of merit] and socialism [legal robbery].Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka sank into 30 years of civil war because of reservation policy directed against Tamils. The visible effect of this sin is continuous collapse of Indian currency.In 1947  4 re was equal to one pound and in 2013 it was 100 re = 1 pound. If Ocholocracy[mob rule]continues it will sink to Rs.10000 = 1 pound accompanied with unending civil war, like in Africa. Any so called "good idea" is to be debunked on the tuch stone of INDIVIDUAL rihts - all good proceeds from Individuals. That is why USA is prospering and USSR Yugoslavia disintegrated. Vajpayees Gandhian Socialism is also bad - Gandhiism is selling Hindus his supporters to buy support of Jinnah, and muslims.=======================================================What if some Indians want to screww mother and Indians want to screww motherland?? Is this the reason why Indian men have difficulty in have girl friends and India does not want to get involved in wars outside India, and is deeply INWARD looking?Sigmund Freud father of psychoanalysis said "mother worship" when asked to define India. Continuing this analysis::Arnab Goswami goes slightly wrong when he says even left loves India. Love non-mediated by religion turns motherly love to love for female. That is why Left is intent of screwwing India. That love is sexual love for mother, motherland. Jats and Kapus in Andhra Pradesh[who have burnt a train] are demanding reservation. That is again immoral sexual love for motherland.Such effect of predatory sexual love for motherland [nothing wrong with motherly love]has even led to murder of motherland in history as following shows..Dahir was BRAHMIN King in Sindh. By enlisting the support of local tribes (such as the Jats, Meds and Bhuttos) and Buddhist rulers of Nerun, Bajhra, Kaka Kolak and Siwistan as infantry to his predominantly-mounted army, Muhammad bin Qasim defeated Dahir and captured his eastern territories for the Umayyad Caliphate.Dahir then tried to prevent Qasim from crossing the Indus River, moving his forces to its eastern banks. Eventually, however, Qasim crossed and defeated forces at Jitor led by Jaisiah (Dahir's son). Qasim fought Dahir at Raor (near modern Nawabshah) in 712, killing him; Dahir's wife immolated herself (with other women in her household) in accordance with the Hindu tradition of Jauhar.=========================================================Academicians have swallowed a fascist lie spread by media that India is a democracy.What a Joke! What about the assault on Individual right of merit by reservation policy? In which country are cities brought to a halt by bandhs? Media should first say India was a Ocholocracy[mob rule].India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] not a democracy. Free speech can be explosive unless it is a part of movement to uproot the Ocholocracy. In a Ocholocracy INDIVIDUAL rights are murdered by definition with help of state. Examples of murder of INDIVIDUAL right are reservation policy which is murder of merit, an INDIVIDUAL right and socialism(by definition legal robbery) which is murder property right, another INDIVIDUAL right.Why are Indians not trusted with free gun laws as in USA? Answer to this simple question demolishes free speech argument.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why were leftists associated with secessionists? The culture of socialist legal robbery is manifesting itself as secessionism - because the socialists may have realized it is impossible to come to an understanding on who the supreme dictator should be and they want to establish numerous single part dictatorships over fragments of country. Socialism has to lead to single party dictatorships over fragments of country.Adam Smith, the father of economics, says in economics Man Proposes and God Disposes. If every body in a nation become do-gooders -- God disposes -- and we will have hell on earth. if man proposes to be selfish -- God again disposes -- and we will have prosperity and peace.Giving rational explanation of God, the elder do-gooders , MK Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Ambedkar etc forgot that a strong socialist state is required to do good. And it will demand its pound of flesh closest to the heart – rampant corruption. A strong state emerges in an environment of shortages – to distribute scant resources. Any socialist state will NOT destroy the reason for its existence. 24 hour water supply will reduce water required to be released by 30%. No Government Engineer in India will accept this. Scarcity, distress is required for the reason for its existence. If no scarcity exists it will manufacture it. Mysore had water scarcity even though it had KRS dam beside it. It is a question of power. A society can either have equality or freedom but never both. Why? To enforce equality a strong and intrusive state is required. Stateism is against Individualism and kills freedom.Since 1947, the political parties, government need not care as they have attained emancipation from democracy -- principally by the tool of reservation policy, where vote banks are formed. And they will vote according to predictable patterns whatever the rulers do or don't do. In other words India has become a Fascist state[socialism is a necessary component of it --Nazi means National Socialist]by the vehicle of reservation policy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just voting does not make India democracy. Protection of rights of the smallest minority the INDIVIDUAL MAKES A SYSTEM DEMOCRATIC. The problem is, India is an Ocholocracy[mob rule] where Individual rights are murdered[example is murder of merit an Individual right by reservation policy and property rights by socialism. Socialism is legal robbery.A period of good dictatorship may be required to cure Indians of disease of bad democracy, due to the infection of socialism or legal robbery. Otherwise bad democracy can kill in millions like in Cambodia under Pol Pot. Ocholocracy looks like democracy but it is not. Just look at immorality of Indians- Laloo the reason for largest migration of Biharis from Bihar was reelected.-----------------------------------------------------------It is logically wrong to allow communist parties to function in a multi party democracy as they are for single party dictatorship - they openly state it! Ban communist parties===================================================Now BJP/RSS should bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=============================================</comment>

<comment>Sandip is now trying to brand all anti national to save those fellow JNU traitors.</comment>

<comment>The JNU is full of traitors who support the Congress party and the Nehru dynasty.

Maneka, Sanjay and Varun Gandhi were and are no exceptions to the rule either.</comment>

<comment>what a stupid headline-Tricolor is national flag of India, not of Smriti Irani</comment>

<comment>This is an example of twisted journalism and presstitution.  The three activists were punished by the court of law since the court found that the activists have committed a crime in accordance with the applicable sections charged on them by the police. So this shows that activists have done something illegal which is not reflected by this article</comment>

<comment>btw what is this Presstituion ? I never seen such a word in any Dictionary | ohhh am an Idiot .</comment>

<comment>why all first post article is pro leftist and pro desh dhohii</comment>

<comment>If RSS don't likes Tricolour ! Article is Deshdrohi #Bhaktlogic</comment>

<comment>If you are a reporter than report fair unbiased. In india many communist organizations do not fly Triranga on theri building. Some minority organization even refuse to hoist Triranga on 15th Aug. and 26th Jan. Atleast I have seen hoisting and saluting Triranga by RSS shakha near my house when I was in India.</comment>

<comment>Ha ha . where were you in India ? What do you know about RSS ?</comment>

<comment>I have been going through these comments for a while, and find Mr Deshbhakt fighting it out single handedly with all . Good stamina! Are you so unemployed that you get so much time or are you paid by some political party for this? Genuinely many of the people would like to know</comment>

<comment>Ever since Dadri, HCU and JNU, Randipan is barking day and night. Wonder how much Congis pay him.</comment>

<comment>but fact is fact my friend ... RSS never ever liked TRICOLOUR neither Accept it</comment>

<comment>Certainly they did not like the tircolor in congress flag.</comment>

<comment>And randipan likes congress and his allies, accept it.</comment>

<comment>So what my friend. This is about the universities that are under govt. RSS isn't a govt organization and has nothing to do with this issue. Can you drag in Aishwarya Rai, Dhoni or Kapil Sharma here? If that seems pointless, then the RSS thing as well.</comment>

<comment>The topic of article is "Why RSS may not like Smriti Irani's flag to fly" did you not got it properly ?</comment>

<comment>My point is why drag in RSS here? Why didn't the author write, why anti nationals may not like her idea, why kejriwal will oppose, why Rahul will oppose, why media will oppose. These are all involved in the JNU case, where is RSS? Why drag RSS in here? I guess you did not get my point.</comment>

<comment>So now you are worried about what RSS thinks and wants? </comment>

<comment>you mean you are a paid agent of Chaddi Gang ?</comment>

<comment>No I am happy with my job. Don't worry, Modi will create enough job so that you are employed as well and do not have to do part time jobs for Congress.</comment>

<comment>Yes, unlike you. You do not even have the money to buy a chaddi.</comment>

<comment>you can buy one for me. always welcome ... :-) wana know about brand name ?</comment>

<comment>Brand: Rahul Gandhi, transparent symbolizing his empty brain.</comment>

<comment>Tomorrow FP will say, why temples are not hoisting national flags instead of the temple flags. What has RSS got to do with the govt or govt universities?</comment>

<comment>yeah ! this is RSS's true colour ... @sabyasachi sanghi ha ha</comment>

<comment>Uh o! So you need Rahul Gandhi's XXXXL chaddi to be hoisted on top of your house, go ahead, who is stopping you?</comment>

<comment>ha ha ... take a burnol</comment>

<comment>It is BJP regime and not RSS, let us not confuse. But, the history of RSS hoisting National flag mentioned in the article leaves a lot to be desired and warrants an explanation and if true deserves condemnation.</comment>

<comment>RSS does not have to respond to the political agenda of anyone.  Do you realize that hoisting national flag at unauthorized places was ill legal?  Why does RSS needs to hoist a national flag in their premises?  You have already described them as anti muslim and should the nagtional flag also be described as anti muslim symbol?Chandraseka "Ran" grow up before commenting on RSS. If you want to sue RSS sue, set up a Commission and give employment to your unemployed cadres.</comment>

<comment>That is not true! Reporter delebrately leaves out many technical details. Ther are so called minority area in India where if you are wearing a Triranga pin, one will attak you! Many political parties and idiological or religious groups do not hoist Triranga on 15th Auguest.</comment>

<comment>What has RSS got to do here, it's a non government organization, why should they even be bothered. FP is a crap media house and it would always remain one. By this, they are trying to oppose HRD's move.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Sad but, true. These fellows are hypocrites, shouting at tolerant Hindus who accept secularism, we have members from Muslim, Christian communities in BJP.</comment>

<comment>ohhh GOD where were you ?</comment>

<comment>Hmmmm...interesting! So be it...lets fly the tricolor over all institutions government/private/public alike.Don't think there should be a problem to anyone with that, infact when we look up and see the tricolor we might find a sense of patriotism within us, in that moment (I prefer assuming that decent people have a decent agenda behind the things they do).But then what next? I mean, feeling patriotic is part one of the step right? Then comes improvement or changes that will lead to a non #JNUrow situation. How do we go about that?</comment>

<comment>The call by HRD Minister is to fly the national flag on a Central Univ, which is a govt building/ property. Why should any one have a problem to it? Is it a dictat to fly the flag on a religious institution? Why compare it  with RSS or Shakhas? It seems to be an attempt to divert the entire argument in a different direction.</comment>

<comment>Who is opposing here ? ha ha tum bhakton ko jabardasti issue create karne mein maza aata hai</comment>

<comment>No one is opposing, but FP is throwing in useless articles with no meaning whatsoever. They see RSS everywhere.</comment>

<comment>Because RSS didn't accept Tricolor .</comment>

<comment>I do not understand one point here ,Issue is people are hesitating to the order of hoisting national flag in central university taking name of RSS. Why RSS did not use national flag in their Headquarter is another issue. But this incident help us ti identify the hypo crate who wore the mask of social activist ,politician , Intellectuals etc.</comment>

<comment>959 comments . Nobody has any problem. Why are you Burning RED ?</comment>

<comment>But I have problem with the people who does not respect our national flag and our country. Idiot like you won't understand it.</comment>

<comment>so ask to RSS . Why they dont like TRICOLOUR ?</comment>

<comment>You fool RSS is no government organisation but Central universities are. Don't take RSS as a shield to justify your argument. And I am not RSS follower and am not defending them.</comment>

<comment>Nobody has any problem with this decision. nor a person neither a Institution. You are acting like a Blind Bhakt , i did not called you RSS BHAKT . This article is about RSS not about GOVT Institution,  did you not got it properly ?</comment>

<comment>Sangh Only believe in Bhagwa (saffron) | so, What ?</comment>

<comment>Since morning FIRST POST IS TRYING THEIR LEVEL BEST TO Defend In Defense able....But Ulti Gaali He pad rahi hai....</comment>

<comment>Hence proved...... That First Post is also Pro Afsal .... Pro Communist.... Who is Funding First Post...??Instead Of Asking Congress , Left , Etc why are they Opposing Government Orders Of Flag Hosting In Central Universities they are asking RSS???...Does First Post has Team of Idiots who writes Posts and No one checks....??</comment>

<comment>Ok so you say that RSS opposes Tiranga flag and BJP is controlled by RSS. So now when BJP is asking to hoist Tiranga across all the universities, it must be in accordance with RSS. Why do you care about how RSS will react? First stop resisting this Govt move to hoist national flag in all Universities. Support it and force Govt to apply the same in each and every school, college and govt office. Be nationalist and not commies..</comment>

<comment>prior to 2005, it was illegal to hoist the national flag publicly, the only exception was the 26th Jan And 15th Aug.</comment>

<comment>first danda to sandipan</comment>

<comment>talk about today not 50 years back u porkistani chuttttttiye</comment>

<comment>RSS is not a government organization and no government is contributing anything to RSS. Moreover they are not rolling on the money of tax payers. Dear Sandipan Sharma, I hardly found no difference between u and other prestitutes like Rajdeep, Burkha, Sagarika, etc., Congress agents are in every media</comment>

<comment>So ur saying ur just like RSS?For people who see RSS conspiracy in everything and hate it to the core, apparently you have some things in common! You both are haters of the nation!They are the extreme right & ur the extreme left!Funny how every time ur exposed as traitors u deflect it straight away on RSS, u keep bringing them in the picture as if to make ppl forget ur case.Basically RSS is the shield the extreme left uses to hide behind. The Govt shud uproot both cancers and cleanse the country for good of elements that are bent on destroying it.</comment>

<comment>Is RSS a governmental organizagtion?  Sandipan's article tried to imply that RSS is a governmental organization and as such hoisting a national flag is in compliance with government regulations.So far as my knowledge goes, RSS is not a governmental organisation.  It is a cultural organization of a particular religious community and the organization stands for the upliftment of the community as a whole. If RSS is wanting to hoist a national flag, let it do so and if it does not want let it not.  However, RSS would have no right to denigrate the flag or insult it which will be dealt with as per the constitutional clauses provided for such offenses.If RSS is to hoist its national flag in its premises as a compliance, then I wonder what would the same group of people think about hoisting national flag in madrasas, YMCA, YWCA, terror outfit premises etc.  I, as an Indida, certainly do not want to my national flag to be seen in any private premises whether it be a cultural, educational or other activities attached to it.  National flag is a symbol of nation and it should rest with Government and Government funded entities.   RSS does not get any government funding like some other religious organizations.One blogger here, Jacquilin Tom, equated the hoisting of national flag to implementing RSS rules. I am appaled at this jocker Jackal's ignorance.  On one side some are criticizing that RSS does not hoist national flag in its premises, on other side, this jocker jackal describes the government order for national flags to be hoisted in government funded universities as a RSS rule.,  Does this jocker jackal know anything what she says?  How and when national flag became synonymous with RSS rules.  I certainly oppose every opportunity of anyone trying to usurp the rights of national flag. It belongs to the nation and nation alone and not to any individual or group or other entities.I would go one step farther to say that Congress as a political party should change the tri color flag as it is mostly equated with national flag by most people.  People are misled to believe that national flag is the right of Congress; as they are not able to discriminate the national flag's wh Ashok Chakra with 24 spokes in in the middle from Congress's flag with a hand in the middle (previously it had the charka with its wheel almost equating to national flag).We have people amongst us mis informed firebrand students in JNU, Jadavpur and motivated leftist teachers who are the ones opposing the national flag. Some questions them for the timing of the order, some questions why should they accept it as a part of their national pride, some just insults it. These are the ones who should be questioned and protested against.  Joker Jackal is one such individual.</comment>

<comment>Are YMCA, YWCA etc organizations with a Political agenda?Do they have political wings that have have ruled the country?I don't see the point of the comparison here, fellow countryman.Even then, YMCA and YWCA have celebrated every Independence/Republic day by hoisting the National Flag.I can attest to that. :)Shouldn't an organization like the RSS which claims to be holier than everything around, have set an example? Unless they have an ulterior motive behind the false Nationalism?Theirs is not Nationalism, its just Hindutva, a bastardized version of a really harmless religion called Hinduism.</comment>

<comment>You have totally missed my point of argument.  Since you raked up something controversial, let me clarify.Indeed YMCA & YWCA are the offshoot of British empire which was certainly political.  So your question is answered if that is what you looked for - a political connection.RSS never ruled the country and it can never.  They do not contest elections nor do they involved in the past or will involve in the future, in law making committees.Like any other contemporary organizations, they may be trying to influence governmental decisions in certain areas where it could possibly be directly relate to their activities or religionists.  Have they succeeded?  Till today nothing they could do substantial in this respect is a fact and a malady from which the Hindu religion continues to suffer.If you ask me which are the organizations who influce the governments, I would name them on your prompting.I have also seen a certificate is being issued by you to Hindu religion.  Hinduism does not need a certificate by anyone especially by Groups like you.  The religion has a strong, especial stronger, mooring in its time tested vedas, shastras and thatwas and the fact that it had survived tens of thousands of years on its own, it is flexible enough to absorb the shocks of changing times and still survive.If anyone is trying to unite various factions and doing a service to hold on to its values itsn't any treason or anti-others. If you call these efforts a "bastardizaztion" be it so; so they have a better survival instinct.  If earlier Hindus were easy victims for conversion and someone amongst them is alerting them not to fall victims to such bastardly activities and you call it it ani-Non-Hindu activism, be it so and we are proud tobe so, for we know how mallable we have been and how we were destroyed by the vistors to our homes.</comment>

<comment>Sanskrit is the most advanced language in the world... and leaves no space for ambiguity(in the mind of machines and circuits)  when it comes to language of computers.but the question is how many people know it, speak it , write it.? We have not developed to that state of intellect barring a few in the society..</comment>

<comment>This is a propaganda to slowly bring down indian constitution and bring in the barbaric RSS rules ( which in turn a indian talibanism). They want to bring old high caste rule back. They are trying to bring back the Brahminism where all others should abide by them. Soon india will see all this come back if BJP continues to keep quiet to all RSS morons.</comment>

<comment>Please ask the kanchi sankaracharya, why he washed his feet when a dalit touched it? Why there are 2 Murugan temples in Madurai, Tamilnadu partitioned by a wall, one for upper caste and another for lower caste? Is you God himself has caste? How many temples allow non-hindus inside? Why your Gods are confined only to hindus? How many Brahmins allow harijans in their house? Even in the most educated states like kerala, the Ezhava community have their own temple and Nairs have different temple....your Gods also practice castism?  How many honor killings happened in the last 5 years in India? Is it because hindus treat other hindus as their own? You just name one corrupt politiacian or any person and I am sure he must be a hindu.. why you have so immoral?</comment>

<comment>Hahahha..I don't usually prefer to answer a dump, but still I am doing...Can your father become your mother or your mother become your father..no right? Same logic here...Pope is a male character and female can't play the role here. Second is when there is qualified black come up, he will become a Pope and no one resisting it unlike in your temples only a Brahmin can become a pujari... Earlier dumps like you say the same thing about US, why a black couldn't become a President in US...When a qualified Obama came, he made as the president...got it my dear dump..:)</comment>

<comment>Vatican is a country which is just 44 hectares which cannot accommodate refugees. Why bring refugees in this case. They are not their citizens to take. These are Indian citizens who are tortured by the radical fringe elements opposing the freedom of speech or  who fear students view. RSS the true anti nationals who was part with british who wanted british to stay here is teaching others nationalism.</comment>

<comment>RSS is world's largest volunteer non government organisation. The mission of RSS , as described in Bunch Of Thoughts by M. S. Golwalkar, is:RSS has been making determined efforts to inculcate in our people the burning devotion for Bharat and its national ethos; kindle in them the spirit of dedication and sterling qualities and character; rouse social consciousness, mutual good-will, love and cooperation among them all; to make them realise that casts, creeds and languages are secondary and that service to the nation is the supreme end and to mold their behaviour accordingly; instill in them a sense of true humility and discipline and train their bodies to be strong and robust so as to shoulder any social responsibility; and thus to create all-round Anushasana in all walks of life and build together all our people into a unified harmonious national whole, extending from Himalayas to Kanyakumari.— M. S. GolwalkarThere are a lots of examples when RSS worked for public welfare.Indian Independence Movement : In the independence movement, In 1930, RSS organized lectures for the common masses on the need to independence. RSS explained to the youth that why independence is important and how we can achieve it. RSS motivated the people to join hands and support the Indian Independence Movement. RSS taught them self defense and fighting technique.Partition of India: The partition of India affected millions of people of India. RSS rescued a lots of people of all the religion who lost their every thing in the violence.At that time Bhagwan Das, who was awarded Bharat Ratna in 1955, called RSS people as "High Spirited and Self-Sacrificing Boys ".Sino-Indian War: RSS worked selflessly  at the time of Sino-Indian War in 1962. RSS helped the wounded soldiers to the relief camp and provided them basic needy things.At that time, Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, requested RSS to take part in Republic Day parade in 1963 in recognition of its work.Indo-Pakistani War of 1965: In 1965, Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri requested RSS to help control traffic in Delhi and few other domestic so that police man could be freed for defense duties. RSS worked selflessly till 22 days of war and helped the nation.Bangladesh War of Independence: RSS volunteers offered their services to maintain law and order of the country and were apparently the first to donate blood.1975 Emergency Period: In 1975, the Indira Gandhi government proclaimed emergency rule in India. Democratic institutions were suspended and opposition leaders were arrested whilst thousands of people were detained. RSS was also banned.Police clamped down on the organization and thousands of its workers were imprisoned. The RSS defied the ban and thousands participated in Satyagraha against the ban and against the violation of human rights regulations. Later,the volunteers of the RSS formed underground movements for the restoration of democracy. It said that the movement was "dominated by tens of thousands of RSS cadres, though more and more young recruits are coming". Talking about its objectives it said "its platform at the moment has only one plank: to bring democracy back to India".The list is not ends here, there are a lot many examples where RSS worked selflessly and helped the people of India. Few of the Disaster Management example are1971 cyclone odisha1977 andhra pradesh cyclone1984 Bhopal Disaster2001 Gujrat Earthquake2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake2004 Indian Ocean earthquake2006 Surat Region Flood2013 Uttarakhand Flood2014 Kashmir FloodIn all these natural calamities, RSS rebuilt villages, provided shelter for the victims, provided cloths, medical necessities, adopted children and rehabilitated the victims.</comment>

<comment>And in all the communal riots happened in India RSS was at one side</comment>

<comment>Only thing i stand with RSS is religious conversion which both christians( protestants and baptists) and muslims do by giving money. But that does'nt mean mean all are bad.</comment>

<comment>Then how you are converted..using a sword by Portuguese?</comment>

<comment>I was not converted by anyone i belong to christians in india who were here for thousands of years. Nobody forced them. I oppose any forced conversions. Its not my fault that i was born christian. I already cleared i don't follow any religion now. All the religious leaders try to play with your mind. Live a good life without creating trouble to other people as a true Indian.</comment>

<comment>Thousand of years?...Only Christians in Kerala are here in India for 1900 years...The Syrian and Chaldean...All other Christians in India came after 14th Century..</comment>

<comment>Yeah thats what im saying im born syrian christian.</comment>

<comment>But your name shows that you are Goan</comment>

<comment>And i don't follow any church now as i believe all this religious institutions are run by money making people. Not any more the good ones. There Might be exceptions. These leader try to polarize people to achieve their motives .</comment>

<comment>Dennis i belong to the Syro Malabar (Syrian Catholic Right) . My name is not jacquilin. Im not the forcibly converted christian like you if your name is correct.</comment>

<comment>You are not forcibly converted...You are converted by seeing some Magic...One place you write you dont follow any church....Next place take proud of your Syro Malabar lineage....For your knowledge...I am dalit Christian converted day before yesterday  for Getting two bag rice and one cow from Missionaries</comment>

<comment>I appreciate the good efforts by RSS. No one is taking them away from you. I am talking about the fringe elements inside RSS who wants to bring the RSS ideologies to be followed by all. RSS people have the right to live as they wish. But don't interfere in other people lives.</comment>

<comment>The only countries which take refugees are these christian countries and they spend billions in them. Stop speaking about other countries this is a problem within india. You are on of those RSS brainwashed sangi. No point in arguing all you know is fight like gundas. Even India has security walls around it . Vatican has hardly 1000 people inside it ( all catholic administrative people). It's inside Italy which has a huge infulx of refugees from all over the world. Hope you read other newspapers too rather than your sakha provided stuffs.</comment>

<comment>I don't care a women or black becoming pope. This is a question like why don't women be a priest in the temple. And i don't think pope has said anything about women in temple. He has many more important things in this world to concentrate on.</comment>

<comment>And why not you RS people go to Africa and feed them and they may convert to Hinduism. If being in a religion can save their life from hunger people will convert . nothing or nobody in this world are good all expect something in return. Stop arguing with this childish attitude . Anybody can go and do what hose christians are doing there. They are filling in a void. Do something and then then lecture other what to do. And sepoy of East India Company common we all know who they were .... The most racist country in the world is India where we discriminate openly our own people citizens of India as Dalit and all. How many of the RSS leaders are from a lower caste. Stop saying vatican vatican ..... by seeing my christian name. I don't care no matter even if you insult vatican coz i dont care what they are doing.</comment>

<comment>If you cannot reply to my questions just leave don't waste your time repeating the same old points which you already told. By the way you have the right to say whatever you want. I appreciate freedom of expression.</comment>

<comment>Ok keep posting against pope. This is what you guys are doing everyone who is not RSS is anti nationals. Pope is subject to criticism. If you don't have any other points to say go after pope which does not concern me at all. Try to solve the problems inside india man before solving world problems. Remember Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Saying:"We need a carrier of eternal goodness and wholesomeness in human conduct, which is called ‘righteousness’. As we say in India:‘Where there is righteousness in the heartThere is beauty in the character.When there is beauty in the character,There is harmony in the home.When there is harmony in the home,There is order in the nation.When there is order in the nation,There is peace in the world."</comment>

<comment>Thats what im saying why talk about other's houses this is all about India. My name is a christian but i don't follow any religion. Its been years i have been to a church. I believe in God and doing good and not bad to others is good enough . You don't have to follow any religion. Vatican or anyone are allowed to convert because people are poor why you guys help them and uplift them from poverty and caste system ( which RSS stands for )where they are suppressed. This another form of the Indira Gandhi government which tries to suppress freedom.</comment>

I know you will repeat the same thing again as you cannot answer my questions. And if they have no rights its their internal problem. As an Indian it doesn't bother me.

<comment>This is the problem with bhakts only what they say is sensible. Ok one simple question do you believe in RSS ideologies or not.</comment>

<comment>Nazi .... RSS is a fascist force like the Hitlers Nazi party where they believe only the higher caste people should rule the country. They know that India has a rising number of young population and unlike the old times students are aware of the happenings across the world thanks to internet. They want to penetrate into campuses which they are never able to do. People with value education will never hear or follow this morons.</comment>

<comment>The only countries which create refugees are these christian countries and they earning billions by warheads and taking control of Oil.</comment>

<comment>Count america out of it.</comment>

<comment>So why are many Indian people working in these western countries. To all whom i have spoken they its the value for human being that makes them stay here more than money. You have the freedom to live your life . No fringe elements decide what you eat or what you wear.</comment>

<comment>by the way Indian are not refugee. and Regarding Eating be particular what you talking about.As we worship Cow and nobody allow to eat. as they cannot eat pork</comment>

<comment>I have been in gulf countries everybody is allowed to eat pork. And only thing is not to eat in front of them. Nobody raids your kitchen and kill you for eating a pork. I dint say all Indians abroad. I know people who say they worship cow and eat steak when they are out of country. Just heard Haryana gives license to foreign people to eat beef. Why if they eat its not a cow. So this is all for political benefits.</comment>

<comment>So people lecturing on whether RSS salutes tricolor or not, can you pls answer why till today,Why J&K has a separate constitution which can over rule the decisions of Indian Parliament, A separate J&K flag, A separate set of rules which can again over rule any rules made by Indian parliament? Can they explain why it is not mandatory for J&K people to honor Tricolor? Can they answer why they need not put up tricolor on govt buildings?And whose courtesy it was and what was Shri Sarda Patel, The Iron man of India, doing when these absurd rules were brought in?</comment>

<comment>india is not RSS and national flag is India...so we don't care about RSS..the flag needs to be hoisted on universities.</comment>

<comment>Simple question.  Do you oppose national flag in universities if not accept the good decision and appreciate rather than making yourself a true commie who thinks about china and marxism more than his mother land </comment>

<comment>dear ss, sardar was too grt a statesman and practical person to see that nationalistic feeling can be induced and not thrust upon on ne one.ur article is an eye opener about who is what....</comment>

<comment>History tells us who fought for nation who not :) and who was with India and who are not.1. The RSS, which portrays itself as a social movement, stayed away from the Indian independence movement. The leader of the RSS in 1940, continued and further strengthened the isolation from the independence movement.2.The RSS had pledged to achieve freedom through "defending religion and culture" and not by fighting the British.3.The British Government stated that the RSS was not at all supporting any civil disobedience against them, and as such their other political activities can be overlooked.4 The Indian Government agreed to lift the ban with the conditions that the RSS pledge its loyalty to the Constitution of India, accept the Tricolor as the National Flag of India and adopt a formal written constitution."The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh initially did not recognize the Tricolor as the National Flag of India. The RSS mouthpiece Organiser, in its issue dated 17 July 1947 demanded, in an editorial titled "National Flag" that the Bhagwa Dhwaj (Saffron Flag) be adopted as the National Flag of India." and they are still trying that and will not succeed in future as well.5. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh did not stop its unrelenting attacks on this issue, and criticised B. R. Ambedkar's public pronouncements that the new Indian Constitution would give equality to all castes.I am not defending any political party. i am a proud indian. I am with India. No Religion can tell whether i true indian or not. I am with the ideas who support to make India good.</comment>

<comment>POINT BY POINT REPLY TO THE BULLSHIT THAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN ASHISHHistory written by whom? Congress party? Next few explanations will burst the myth that you are trying to propagate against RSS1. RSS was in the forefront of fight against British rule, just as thousands of other organisations . They however stayed away from the Quit India Movement started by congress party as they had differences with Congress. Just because congress has spread the myth that Britishers quit India because of Just the Quit India movement, post-independence Cong appointed historians have painted that RSS did not join the independence movement.Please remember, independence wasn’t won ONLY by the Congress. There were many many other organisations who did their bit. Only difference is that after independence they went back to their lives, leaving congress to enjoy power after independence.2. Everyone has had their means to achieve freedom. Chandrashekhar azad, Bhagat Singh and others through revolutionary means. Netaji through raising the INA and attacking India, even if resulted in taking help from Nazis, fascists and Imperialistic Japan. If you think that RSS’s means to achieve independence was wrong as it did not confirm to Cong’s ideals, they Bhagat Singh, Chandrasekhar Azad and Netaji also had no role in Independence movement.3.	What British thought is their problem. But so many nationalist organisations did not join the Congress party’s program of civil disobedience. So do you mean that u can ignore contributions of others? Its India’s bad luck that we had such pathetic political leaders post-independence that they usurped all credit for independence for their political party and leaders.4. Indian government had banned RSS as it was accused of conspiring to kill Mr Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. However, once the courts decided that there is no evidence to prove this allegation, Govt of India had no option other than lifting the ban. There were some additional conditions attached, which RSS accepted as it did not want a political role.To break the biggest myth, the Tri colour was not a unanimous choice to be made the Indian flag. In a newly independently country everybody had a view on what flag we should have. What should be our national anthem. What should be the national emblem. There were so many papers written by lot of organisations. Reasons were given and they were opposed. At last a consensus was built onTricolour as national flag (congress’s suggestion). Only change was the “charkha” was replaced by Ashok Chakra.Jana gana mana as national anthem instead of Vande Mataram. Vande Mataram was then recognised as national song.It was a democratic process and every 1 had a view and they express it, including RSS. But once consensus was agreed, RSS proudly flew the tricolour in its head quarters on 15 August 1947 (this fact is on matter of records).However, if congress spin masters still believe that you can abuse RSS for its article in July 1947 expressing its views on the flag are insulting the entire consultative process that went in giving independent India, its identity and its constitution.5. I would really like you to produce evidence on this topic. No hearsay. Any article, letter, speech etc. Cong historians like Romila Thapar and Ramchandra Guha have spread lot of muck on basis of hearsay. Typical “Salma said this, Sabrina heard that” system that congress has mastered over years.</comment>

<comment>I love to reply to your bullsh*t which you put on my comment SOUMYA.1. They(RSS) were never is picture. M.S. Golwalkar, who became the leader of the RSS in 1940, continued and further strengthened the isolation from the independence movement. In his view, the RSS had pledged to achieve freedom through "defending religion and culture" and not by fighting the British. By defending religion you can never fight for India.2. You quoted "Everyone has had their means to achieve freedom. Chandrashekhar azad, Bhagat Singh and others through revolutionary means. " I respect Chandrashekhar azad, Bhagat Singh as they played a vital role in Independence but u can't compare them with M.S.Golwalkar who focused on achieve freedom through "defending religion and culture".3. I never specified in my comment about joining congress party will do everything. It was whether who was actively involved in the independence of the India and it was not RSS. That's why British were not scared of RSS. They were scared of  Chandrashekhar azad, Bhagat Singh and Mahatma Gandhi but not RSS.4. Simple : 90 % worked for Independence, now RSS is coming and claiming about that. RSS always emphasize on religion not nation. That's why tricolor was selected. People who get distinction only get the scholarships.5. For me congress is not perfect and even i dnt vote for them but they never emphasize on Religion. Even RSS criticised B. R. Ambedkar's public pronouncements that the new Indian Constitution would give equality to all castes. Now RSS these days try to be nationalists who try to impose their ideology on others. I thank RSS volunteers who offered their services to maintain law and order of the country and were apparently the first to donate blood in 1971(Bangladesh war of Independence).</comment>

<comment>Just answer one question do you want tri color on top of every Indian university or not. Don't beat around the bush. </comment>

<comment>I will always support. There is no problem is that.</comment>

<comment>this kind of blackmail is questionable.  b4 askin some explanation is required</comment>

<comment>In case of national flag and being nationalist there need not be any explanation it is either one is or not no half measures</comment>

<comment>the same zeal shld be shown by the govt to that outfit which dint hoist natl flag at its HQ for more than 40 years. this should be brought to the knowledge  of masses.</comment>

<comment>What a historian !!!!Do you also know that MK Gandhi visited Sakha and was mesmerized to see that there was total equality with out any caste creed discrimination? Do you also know that Sri BR Ambedkar himself visited and observed RSS- Sakha activities for many days and said they have truly implemented what he fought for..Do you know that Netaji personally visited Hedgewar for personal guidance and blessings for his activities in freedom fight?Do you have any idea that the first unanimously accepted national flag was a Bhagva Dwaj and not a tricolor? Its democratic decision was ridiculed and changed only after Nehru introduced minority members in the team to change and alter the majority balance?People who shout that RSS did not honor constitution, are still dumb on why J&K was given special status, separate flag, separate constitution and powers which can over rule Indian Constitution....Any answers , Mr Historian cum proud Indian cum being with India ? </comment>

<comment>are u appreciating him or there is a streak of satire in what u proclaim.......</comment>

<comment>I just told him, his history knowledge is nothing but a Jack aA !ss</comment>

<comment>These Self proclaimed bogus Nationalist Bhakts brigade should ask to PM about 20K cr bad loans reported in this year. Does RSS has economic think tank or they just produced people who are always raises controversial & non serious issues?</comment>

<comment>This new trend of challenging every countrymen of this nation to prove their patriotism is dangerous. Why the hell should I even engage such people who question my nationality and patriotism? I don't have to wear it on my sleeve, nor do I have to shout from rooftops to prove it. I have a right to live in this nation, have a right to this land without someone trying make me prove it.In all this hullabaloo we forget why is this agitation.  "Kashmir" "Azadi" "Pakistan".. these 3 words, spoken at the same time shouldn't scare the shiiit of any Indian or Indian govt. When you engage in debate with people who raise these words together you will find a solution.  If you stifle them you are already creating a "us" vs "them"  in their minds. Kashmiri's are our people. Listen to them.  Hear them out. Do not send more troops or soldiers to solve this issue. When your child is angry with you,  you don't smack the child and send it away. You work with your child to find out what the problem is and what's the best solution for the predicament. </comment>

<comment>What is the fear about a national flag in universities.  If you are not afraid that spreading communism will be difficult if people feel patriotic why the fear </comment>

<comment>National flag means nothing if people fly it or not. It is what lives inside everyone's heart that matters. It means squat if I fly a national flag on my house and hate my neighbors for not flying it. It depends on the person. Westerners wear their flag as underwear. It doesn't mean they are less patriotic. Imposition of any kind is not healthy.</comment>

<comment>Lets hoist flag everywhere including writers home. Why he has problem with flag hoisting at universities. He should write a big article about the counter question but should not counter the intention of hoisting the flag in universities.</comment>

<comment>There is no point to argue about hoisting national flag in the central funded universities. Centre didn't ask to hoist national flag in madrasa/firstpost office/author's house, so why author should make so much controversies. RSS is not government organization,author arguments holds good if RSS is government organization. Really fed up of firstpost,on seeing repeated articles from this author who is definitely suffering from NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER. What author  requires now is treatment,not space/column to express his delusional ideas.</comment>

<comment>So except the bhakts all others have to show their certificates of being Patriots and Nationalists!!! Coming from those people who had no contribution at all. What an irony!  It is like the case of the jungle. After the lions had hunted the prey, the hyanaes come in packs ad chase away the lions to feed on it..</comment>

<comment>The person who really suffers from this disorder is none other than Feku. In addition he has psychopathy and Machavelian personality. Together called the dark triad. </comment>

<comment>few months back the bigots in RSS had a national meet in delhi..... the whole central cabinet went there to present their report cards including fekuchand PM...... why did they go there then ??? i guess to check if toilets were working or not !!</comment>

<comment>By taking this bold decision, Smriti Irani has told the Congi plus Left and Ramachandra Guha in particular that BJP is not toeing the RSS line.  Hope they will stop saying BJP is controlled by RSS/</comment>

<comment>daily dose of FakePost propaganda .. we aint falling for it chutiyon</comment>

<comment>RSS may have been traitors before independence but now they have changed. Subah ka bhoola agar shaam ko ghar aa jaaye toh use bhoola nahi kehte. </comment>

<comment>what stupid logic.... even going by ur stupid logic, then this logic shud be applied to afzal guru's and yakub's of the world , isnt it</comment>

<comment>The Nation is put to ransom by the media, they want to divert the agenda of the nation and always either give excess importance to RSS or rather criticise it, is there no other organisation which is not at the centre of discussion, why are you always comparing the action of the government with the agenda of RSS, does the media know that many of the Muslim and Communist organisations does not respect the Tri-color . why dont this media talk about them,They are the agents of the Church, who are conveniently using the Communists to divide this country</comment>

<comment>Sandipan is wrong in claiming that Left hoist National Flag on their premises, while fact remains that "Ajay Bhawan" is yet to see the colors of National Flag till today.</comment>

<comment>These right wingers are cheapstakes. Double headed snakes who could stoop to any level of treachery.</comment>

<comment>Now the Right Winger BJP publicly asked the Universities under their control to hoist the National Flag.  They have declared openly where they belong.  What about those who shouted at JNU and other Leftist controlled Institutions?  Why this debate at all?</comment>

<comment>Like i said cheapstakes and two headed snakes. RSS took two men to court for against hoisting the National Flag at their campus. The court battle lasted for 8 years. Educate yourself. Please do not come back saying BJP has nothing to do with RSS. Then you are just a dimwit moron</comment>

<comment>See the old Jhansi ki rani movie of Anand math. Ulterior motives in the mind capricious word spinning Bhagva haters is obvious.</comment>

<comment>RSS believes in the concept of Akhand Bharat and hence their saffron flag represents the goddess/deity of an undivided India i.e. Bharat Mata. On the contrary Congi sycophants don't understand the logic behind the colour of the RSS flag. Instead of using 3 different colours in the tricolour to represent the religious distinctions in India, in the garb of diversity, RSS believes in the policy of One Nation, One people.The wholly saffron colour of their flag encompasses all the people of India, irrespective of the barriers of religion, class, caste and creed, language, etc. It is in fact a unifying aspect of the colour of their flag, not a divisive one and what's more, the saffron colour even advocates peace, not divisive violence. Since the RSS does not believe in the concept of the tricolor containing divisive colors, hence they do not hoist it.Their intention behind it is very noble, which unfortunately these sickular brainwashed people cannot comprehend and don't try to either. Yet the RSS has always shown the tricolor a lot of respect and has let its cadres hoist it at their homes or shakhas.</comment>

<comment>If what you said is true about ugarwadi rss's noble intentions of not hoisting a tiranga as it represents divided India, then why do the RSS ugarwadis go about killing every minority in India?You cant fool all the people all the time man. Everybody knows the real ugly truth of what the rss stands for. It's only the bazaru industrialists who funded bjpee to come to power by buying a slim 31% vote share. The remaining 70% of India cannot be bought, and will consign rss to the dustbin of history forever in 2019.</comment>

<comment>Now the BJP has openly said where they belong - why debate it.  Let anyone from RSS say they don't like it and face the consequence.  Why debate unnecessarily on this.  Let those from the Left, Right and Center who don't honor the National Flag join together and others from all parties irrespective of the ideology join together.</comment>

<comment>In Kerala, there have been many killings of RSS workers by CPI workers. Give proof RSS is killing minority. Why is it not in news? Don't just believe Congress jokers n make comments</comment>

<comment>you want proof? just go and ask anyone on the road and they will tell you the proof about rss.</comment>

<comment>When I asked on road, people said about how RSS workers played a major role in bringing flood hit Chennai back to life. I saw RSS workers teaching values to children, not Jihad and riots!</comment>

<comment>can you can anyone, and who are anyone?</comment>

<comment> Jat quota row: Protests turn violent in Rohtak, CM Khattar calls for all-party meet Wherever BJP goes Violence follows???</comment>

<comment>Yes, from the time AK became the C.M of a Municipal Corporation called Delhi, his allocation of funds in the budget is so huge he just spreads venom instead of governance.  People like you are a prey to this propaganda.</comment>

<comment>Wherever BJP goes, Pappuism follows. Hence the false alarms of violence and intolerance.</comment>

<comment>ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. nice one</comment>

<comment>Yea but not from SC, which is the real deal you moron .. there may be thousands of idiots in India supporting JNU, but you have to accept, they are stupids and will get nothing</comment>

<comment>From an AAPtard, you have transformed into an anti-nationalNow their is no basic difference between you and that Global Godra chap</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the Certificate</comment>

<comment>Not really. You have to read your own comments to realise what you are doing.I think it will be a good idea, if you say that you are no longer an AAPtard.Because seriously, your comments are bringing a very bad name to AAP movement</comment>

<comment>I know what I am doing.</comment>

<comment>Maybe. But net result is embarrassing and defaming AAP.That is the result if people read your comments over last few days and assume that in some way, they reflect AAP's stand also</comment>

<comment>That certificate is also a ticket for you to go to Porkistan.</comment>

<comment>Why they sent you a letter asking for u r support?</comment>

<comment> The right-wing attack on universities  http://www.deccanherald.com/content/527976/right-wing-attack-universities.html </comment>

<comment>Factually, why do minority representative parties hoist and wave green flags either then? Surely they too should hoist only the tricolor if they claim to represent secularism, eg. the Owaisis.</comment>

<comment>I would rather have Owaisi watching my back than Shiv Sena cowards,who can only beat up poor Biharis</comment>

<comment>Yeah sure. When they become the majority in this nation, he'll stab you in the same back and kick you on you a$$.</comment>

<comment>OWAISI is 100 times better than SHIV Sena who beats up fellow Hindus and run like cowards when terrorists attack</comment>

<comment>Oh yeah, right! Your idol Owaisi is the one who orders his party members to assault one of their so-called Muslim sisters, Taslima Nasreen. The Shiv Sena beats up those they consider a threat to their religion, unlike Owaisi and MIM which won't hesitate to assault a fellow Muslim, that too a woman just because she expressed an opinion different from theirs. Shiv Sena at least honestly admits that it doesn't believe in democracy and secularism and has no two opinions about that. Unlike MIM and the Owaisis who make a false show of representing secularism and in the garb of the that, in fact indulge in divisive politics. You are the one who should be ashamed of his existence.</comment>

<comment>Enough of this "Kanhaiya" news, media unknowingly is laying a political platform for this hitter unknown guy.</comment>

<comment>People have forgotten about Hardik chewtiya patel-he was much smarter-this Chewtiyaaa looks like a street bhanggiii</comment>

<comment>Hardick.. is Softdick now.</comment>

<comment>That's how they misled the nation in the past promoting Ishrat Jehan too.</comment>

<comment>The thing is media should be held accountable for everything they write or post. Else things won't improve.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately there is no regulatory authority. And no one seems to bother about that. Do you know that actually Raga wanted to implement that?</comment>

<comment>Oh, this is news to me.However, the news sites these days don't report news. They propagate their views. Which is absolutely wrong.</comment>

<comment>She is Nitish Kumar's beti</comment>

<comment>i would be happy to have some meaningful, honest exchange of knowledge & views,for my understanding JNU is a left leaning organisation, supporting Naxalism or just Anti - Government asking for Social Justice & feel RSS is a legacy of Brahmanism Atrocities looking to dominate & set agenda for whole of India & care less for other Indians choice of food, or cultural identity.   ?Umar Khalid, a Muslim feels India (Hindus) is wrong to be governing a majority Muslim State, Kashmir, & feel that it indulges in violence & atrocities & feel Afzal Guru wasn't given fair trail in the court of Law.RSS looks at this in a whole different way, for them in it about Hinduism & about Akhand Bharat, about Hindu Culture, & more importantly about Hindu deities & feel Muslims are a legacy of Mughal Era & have no right today to ask for any stake in Indiafeel Hindu Cultures should not be question, their deities should be shown as much respect as Muslims or Christians seek based on their religion.if Dalits do not feel happy about their state of life who is to blame, the country, or those in the Government & who are they suppose to be fighting, the country or those in power,if a Muslim of Kashmir or a Christian of Nagaland wants freedom, may be he is not fighting against India, may it's the injustice that they face,as a Muslim  myself, i mean i can be in any country, any part of the world, what i want, i want freedom to practice my religion, i want safety for myself, my family, freedom to have my choice of food, i want equal stake & as much right as any other person.South Africa was ruled by Whites , why did the Blacks fought back, because the Whites were ill treating the blacks & only because they had a darker skin colour, now that is serious , both Whites & Blacks are Christians & yet we had so much atrocities happening ot them, i mean if people can be mistreated for such reason, than we are not done yet,Democracy was suppose to be giving equal rights for every individual & equal opportunity, but more & more countries are using force to suppress their people's freedom, why, because they have come up inadequate , have failed to provide basic necessities to its people & are using other means, diversion tactics to justify their being,farmers death is not a issues, lack of water is not an issue, lack of women safety is not an issue, falling healthcare is not an Issue, housing is not an issue,& before i am called a Congress agent, i think Rahul Gandhi is just a pappu, who doesn't have it in him to lead, & it's certainly not his birthright.</comment>

<comment>Sabir, only thing is that common indian citizen is not that liberal in thought and practices. Moreover India is amalgamation of different nationalities andreligious practices. To propagate common brotherhood in polarised envoirmentis not useful.People who work against the idea of india is intoxicated by power and are reallyabusing it. Idea of India is Akhand Bharat to them but they want United Landnot United people of India.Kashmir to hamara hai par, Kashmiri traitors hai, North east to hamara hai par,yeh chinki chiristian pata nahin kya kya khate hai.So before claiming land we need to claim its people as ours. These goons can notdictate who & how one become nationalist or anti national.This is a bad phase for india and it will pass for long time.</comment>

<comment>And why should an Indian muslim oppose Akhand Bharat? (in case RSS wants this)Please answer this</comment>

<comment>do you really understand what you mean by Akahnd Bharat,i mean, Pakistan, Bangladesh being part of India, really, isn't that disaster of an idea generally speaking, leave out the religion part, even without it, it's just laughable & recipe for disaster to manage.</comment>

<comment>OK. So let it be a dream of RSS nerds if it laughable.What is there to oppose so vehemently by muslims like you if it is not an issue of religion or empathy for Bangladesh, Pakistan muslims etc</comment>

<comment>What do you mean by point 3, Umar Khalid feels that Hindus should not be ruling a muslim dominated state like Kashmir? How did religion come into this?</comment>

<comment>i can tell u one thingif muslim appeasement stops then these hindu fanatics will vanish</comment>

<comment>what appeasement, do you buy it, ok, what is stopping all the successive government from having a uniform civil code, that gives that bit of religious freedom, but treats every individual equally, no Reservation, no signs of religion in government institutions,</comment>

<comment>then why dont ur leaders support UCC? im sure if that happens u n ur ilk will go on a rampage.</comment>

<comment>"that gives that bit of religious freedom" i mean Uniform Civil Code, not Hindu Code, you get it, that probably could be the fear, why would Muslims oppose it, if we have a draft ready that is really talking about all Indians as Equal, no minorities, no majority, why would anyone be against it,</comment>

<comment>come out openly against polygamy, triple talaq, etc</comment>

<comment>then start from ur own housestop playing victimsstop taking hajj subsidies and other benefits.</comment>

<comment>please start the discussion on Uniform Civil Code, please, we do not want any Subsidies as long as others also do not get it in some other form, we do not want anything extra or over & above than what the Government should be doing it for its citizen as a whole.</comment>

<comment>Kanhaiya in Jail no. 3, Tihar. Same as where Afzal was also put. Real poetic justice...LOL</comment>
