<comment>Why the Municipal Corporation of Delhi is refusing to comply with the Delhi Government directive of  auditing  its accounts  on the premise that it doesn't come under the purview of State Government and is accountable to only the Central Government !?If it is only answerable to the Central Government, why is it seeking funds from the State Government then ?  Isn't this blatant double standards ?And what is there to hide for this corruption den named the MCD run by the BJPee which has made a total mockery of governance literally taking the Capital to ransom with its total indifference to civic and sanitation issues !!</comment>

<comment>Delhi is run by AAP but it still gets funding from Central Government. We have a federal structure and even though MCD is an autonomous body, Delhi govt. pays for everything. It has nothing to do with AAP or BJP. So it's Delhi govt. fault for this salary mess.</comment>

<comment>FAke SARKAR Fake Vade-AAP is spending 60 crores in 11 months to improve the image of AK babu on ad in all the news paper. But will not pay salary to teaches, govt doctors , and Mcd employeesWhat a sarkar for AAM adami?</comment>

<comment>They need salaries. Not ur support. </comment>

<comment>Then why is he playing politics and not releasing funds.</comment>

<comment>The State Government says that it has already released the funds and only the DDA is yet to release its part for the salaries to be paid to the poor Sanitation workers !!</comment>

<comment>They have used their AAP formula and not the Finance Commission formula for the share, thats the problem.</comment>

<comment>Yes, great question. I agree with you. Modiji, why ARE you playing politics and not releasing funds? </comment>

<comment>Shirking responsibilty and blaming others is your birthright.</comment>

<comment>when did centre release funds to municipalities</comment>

<comment>Go get your facts right. Centre owes hundreds of crores to MCD by way of DDA parking fees and money promised through Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan. The point is that Centre has NOT released those funds.</comment>

<comment>lol , parking fees whats that ? should the govt pay parking fees lol, swatch bharat abhiyan is for making the place clean not pay salaries , the salaries are to be borne by khujli , after all he is acting s though he is getting it from his grand father , he did raise his salary for spreading dengue by 400 %</comment>

<comment>Ask dramawal to step aside. Modi will take much better care of Delhi. </comment>

<comment>Ask Modi to step aside. AAP will take much better care of Delhi. All issues are only with BJP-managed parts of Delhi administration.</comment>

<comment>Where was Modi when he increased his salary four ford</comment>

<comment>I don't know. Go ask Modi, I guess</comment>

<comment>Tweeterwal should just stay in bangalore and hope everything gets fixed by tweeting...</comment>

<comment>AAP specializes in dual faced politics... On one hand, it withholds the salary in order to blame BJP. On other hand, it conducts such eye wash 'stunts' to be potrayed favorably.. What can one expect wih a party led by a muftkhor chameleon type Kejruddin. Delhi deserves this for electing AAP.,. </comment>

<comment>Bhjpa has done unprecedented corruption in MCD.if a independent auditor audits MCD accounts.they will find massive irregularities</comment>

<comment>is it  ?  to not pay salaries and take that money home without the govt knowing it . well that's a bit far fetched but why did not khujli act on the corruption , he could have well formed a commission of enquiry after all he is releasing the money to the MCD</comment>

<comment>Moddisir govt preventing delhi govt to act in corrupts. Even AC deparment has been captured by delhi govt. People see all this. </comment>

<comment>Auditors will find a big ZERO.</comment>

<comment>What prevents the Delhi Govt from setting one up?</comment>

<comment>True. These aaptards are just drama.</comment>

<comment>Delhi public should get united & thrash these AAP cheats black & blue..Phod dalo  salon ko..</comment>

<comment>Dehlites 100% deserves this Khujliwal ! They elected it !</comment>

<comment>AAP has already clarified that it has paid its due amount to the MCD , whereas DDA hasn't as well taxes aren't being collected by MCD.....so this is a situation manufactured by BJP for political gain, anyone who claims in the contrary is a complete idiot</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal has refused to accept the 4th Finance Commission report despite court orders, which mandates his govt to pay 12.5% of tax to MCD... WHY ?</comment>

<comment>Which  school  did you  went in? </comment>

<comment>Yea man, thank God most people in India didn't go to your school. Every morning I wake up and thank God that I am not as stupid as you.</comment>

<comment>Not the one you went to, thankfully. He writes correct English and what he says is true as well.</comment>

<comment>Bogan  don't  even know  facts  and express  opinion. Thankfully there were no lying  lessons  taught  at our  school.  Moron </comment>

<comment>If Kejriwal is sincere in solving the problems he has to talk to and not fight with LG and Govt of India.They can't fight and get goodwill.Do you agree?</comment>

<comment>Really? Did you read the article by Tarique Anwar on this topic yesterday? He lays out the genesis of the problem and the extent to which back payments are due to the corporations from the state. Kindly go through that article.</comment>

<comment>Hum kaam karte rahe aur woh pareshaan karte rahe</comment>

<comment>BMC is under sena even when congress ruled Mumbai no hassle BBMP was under BJP when congress was in power no hassle Only AK has hassles with everyone in india </comment>

<comment>We are not living in history talk about present? Khujli and arr0gant AAPTards like you can just keep on mourning.The country is regressing due to people like you (AAPTards). E.g. The Swach Bharat Abhiyan : how can it be successful if workers are not paid ?</comment>

<comment>Chuttad learn how to cooperate with others both AK and modi lacks in that </comment>

<comment>But Modi Govt is very good to kick all the jeh@d1s out of this country</comment>

<comment>So basically, police and administration is with central govt, sanitation and other works are with MCD. So, why do we need a AAP govt then, for advertisements and MLA hikes?</comment>

<comment>That is a question that should have been asked and answered 25 years ago.</comment>

<comment>thats what they have done till now , and in the process spread dengue and now going to spread pika</comment>

<comment>If BJP  cannot run MCD , they should just step down and make way for someone else who can do. They turned out to be so incompetent.</comment>

<comment>So Raghav Chadha lied on prime time TV when he said that salaries have been paid??Shocking!! (Not)</comment>

<comment>No, if he would have spoken the truth - that would have been shocking !</comment>

<comment>Lousy liar, bra1nless, shameless & rud3 Khujli, it is your govt. whom are you going to blame now ???</comment>

<comment>Centre should just not give funds of MCD to AAP in the first place. It should directly divert it to MCD. Its the responsibility of state gov, kejri's to give funds to Municipal Corporation. But now too it has become the job of PM. Its not surprising that they will not follow any law.</comment>

<comment>Centre gives money to state? Hahaha, best joke of the day. It's the other way, man. The state collects taxes and gives it to centre and the centre pays back a small fraction to cover specific central schemes. The central govt owes hundreds of crores to MCD by way of the (a)Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan and through the DDA which is controlled by the centre in Delhi.  Get your facts right before making a fool of yourself so publicly. </comment>

<comment>What about budget of states? Centre allocates the funds to states and then States allocate it to Municipalities and Panchayats. Here I am simply saying to overlook Delhi Government and directly allocate funds to MCD. You should get your facts right. I know land comes under Centre and that was not the issue in the first place. You aaptards have the habit of taking a discussion to somewhere else. When did DDA came into picture??</comment>

<comment>Centre does NOT pay funds to MCD through Delhi government. All funds owed by the Centre via DDA and Swachh Bharat, are owed directly to MCD. Modiji refuses to pay MCD and MCD refuses to demand its share from the Centre and yet both come clamouring to the Delhi govt for money. That's the joke that you BJPigs don't get.</comment>

<comment>Till now the Law that I have read, its the State Government that allocates funds to Municipalities and Panchayats. DDA should get money from centre as land comes under Centre but it does not make any sense to me that Municipalities also come under Centre. Please provide me any article of Delhi Act where its written what you are claiming. As you know you are an aaptard and I wont believe you if you dont provide any proof. I will certainly get knowledge even if I loose this discussion. Waiting for your reply....</comment>

<comment>Central Government didnt gave it...That is problem...</comment>

<comment>no municipality gets funds from centre , sickulo chute xtian , get that into your brain if you have any ,</comment>

<comment>Mafakker..Dont Vomit here with out knowing what is happening in Delhi</comment>

<comment>well who is MF ,xtian  clans , they do not know their prophet's MF and they are preaching to this world . Delhi is an aap hole filled with aapturds and deserves the dengue and Zika maybe together</comment>

<comment>Before that Fekku got poten virus..and he became impotent..Ran away after first night</comment>

<comment>lol, so u think modi is  a prophet lol, get out of the modi obsession and try to find the MF of your Prophet , maybe u will get a nobel prize , or atleast get an award by some sickulo chute govt in Inidan states like say manipur</comment>

<comment>Modi...I Said fekku..You got mistaken</comment>

<comment>Bra1nless, dumb AAPTard don't just shoot blanks !The fact is Kangress paid, pAAPi Khujli gang is busy hiking salaries, hiking fuel price, certifying honest Lallooo, badgering oddly on even days, the list is never ending Only arr0gant, l0usy, lazy & dumb cr0wd who wants everything for free or subsidized, are pAAPi supporters. You have to be a mor0n creep1ng for everything to be an AAPTard, who enjoys someone getting hang3d in public and happy to support released inmates with cash & gifs !!Safe Delhi ?</comment>

<comment>67-3.Enough said.</comment>

<comment>Write more 67-3 ..Is the Slap on the face and the Kick on the butt of Modi</comment>

<comment>They already gave 1 year funds to Kejri. Otherwise how do you suppose kejri and his aap members are getting salaries?? Please tell me!!</comment>

<comment>You will have many questions..which yourself know its answers...</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal has been busy picking up fights with LG and the Central govt rather than enlisting their support for governing Delhi.Now that he realises that confrontation doesn't pay he is making conciliatory noises.This man's ideology rooted in anarchy is dangerous for the system.He thinks he is the only visionary and rest all are fools and corrupt.After wasting one full year in petty fights with nothing to show for achievement he is trying to change tack.</comment>

<comment>He is only doing ballyhoo, no work. A paid puppet of Pappu and dayan mata.</comment>

<comment>Bhjpa is hell bent on creating trouble in Delhi. They are bad losers. They are trying to take revenge from delhi public who rejected them 3/70.</comment>

<comment>Now the Doctors & Nurses have joined the MCD Workers Strike. Just asking.. Will AAP Ministers-MLAs wear the apron & become Doctors & Nurses?</comment>

<comment>You are very good at asking questions......but only ask questions from AK...keep asking questions...its your right not the ask the same question to Moddisir....it your right to be a biased...its your right to not question the real issues but just beat about the bush</comment>

<comment>now u will be saying that the 2 school children one falling in a septic tank of a govt run school another in a pit of a pvt sickular school in delhi is the hand work of centre , lols get your head examined , the cannot prevent deaths in their schools , they get 400 % hike in their salaries , they do not pay safaiwalas and thence spread dengue , and they claim to work for aam aadmi lol</comment>

<comment>I agree...bjp can go down to any level.</comment>

<comment>AAPTard what is it you trying to tell with regards to the subject ?</comment>
