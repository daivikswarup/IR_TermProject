<comment>well we know the patriotism of those who call UBL as osama ji and guru as afzal guru ji . after all  AG was hung by you guys , now why is your leader protesting against that , is that patriotism</comment>

<comment>The Congress Party is perfectly justified in taking objection to Amit Shah's taunt that it lacks patriotism. The Party which has always owed allegiance to Nehru family, whose patriotism is beyond question, going by the track record of the past prime ministers. Nehru kept it a secret from the Nation that China was arming itself to the teeth on the border until one day the Chinese army ran over us and inflicted a humiliating defeat. He gave away thousands of Square KMs of Indian territory in the North East  to China as, according to him "No two great countries should quarrel over a piece of land where no grass even grows", Indira Gandhi, in a remarkably generous gesture, returned 90,000 Pakistani POWs after the Bangaladesh War without bargaining with Bhutto for getting back POK. She also ceded Katcha Theevu to Sri Lanka which lets the Sri Lankan Army imprison our Fisherman for violating their territorial waters.In order to settle personal scores with the Akali Dal, she created Bhindranwale which proved so costly for the Nation because of Khalistan terrorists. Rajiv Gandhi allowed Warren Anderson of Union Carbide to escape the long arm of our law after Bhopal Gas tragedy. As a result the Bhopal Gas victims have not received any help till date.He was actively supporting the LEET to wage war against Sri Lanka and later ditched them. He paid with his life for this folly. With such great patriotic acts in its Kitty by its former Prime Ministers, who can accuse Congress Party of lacking in Patriotism.?</comment>

<comment>??</comment>

<comment>Surjewala should know that licking the a*8 of Nehru-Gandhi family is not the same as patriotism!</comment>

<comment>There are only two parties that are responsible for partition of India that led to creation of the most Jehadi of all Sunni nations on Earth: Pakistan. Those two parties that together made a deal with brits were: Congress and Muslim league...so Congress does need reminders time to time so that their idiotic leaders don't keep asking for partitions.</comment>

<comment>As if you are an expert in Indian Indepedence.</comment>

<comment>It is logically wrong to allow communist parties to function in a multi party democracy as they are for single party dictatorship - they openly state it! Ban communist parties========================================================================---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] not a democracy. Free speech can be explosive unless it is a part of movement to uproot the Ocholocracy. In a Ocholocracy INDIVIDUAL rights are murdered by definition with help of state. Examples of murder of INDIVIDUAL right are reservation policy which is murder of merit, an INDIVIDUAL right and socialism(by definition legal robbery) which is murder property right, another INDIVIDUAL right.Why are Indians not trusted with free gun laws as in USA? Answer to this simple question demolishes free speech argument.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why were leftists associated with secessionists? The culture of socialist legal robbery is manifesting itself as secessionism - because the socialists may have realized it is impossible to come to an understanding on who the supreme dictator should be and they want to establish numerous single part dictatorships over fragments of country.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just voting does not make India democracy. Protection of rights of the smallest minority the INDIVIDUAL MAKES A SYSTEM DEMOCRATIC. The problem is, India is an Ocholocracy[mob rule] where Individual rights are murdered[example is murder of merit an Individual right by reservation policy and property rights by socialism. Socialism is legal robbery.A period of good dictatorship may be required to cure Indians of disease of bad democracy, due to the infection of socialism or legal robbery. Otherwise bad democracy can kill in millions like in Cambodia under Pol Pot. Ocholocracy looks like democracy but it is not. Just look at immorality of Indians- Laloo the reason for largest migration of Biharis from Bihar was reelected.</comment>

<comment>There is no difference in the current govt's ideology. Anybody talks against them are anti national. You know why? Because most of them are uneducated and uncultured. Illeteracy makes them ignorant and think that they are always right. </comment>

<comment>its not anyone who is talking against the govt , nitish , ak all talk against it , are they branded as anti nationals , anyone who opposed the left ideology of university campus politics  is termed as intolerant ,</comment>

<comment>yawnnn....whats ur concern...ur beloved martyrs are addressed as Osamaji and Afzal Guruji..Want to badly get into ur patriots list...Now what next...ur godmther barwaitress is the most literate and cultured..ur divine father Pappu the retard is the most intelligent man on this universe</comment>

<comment>Rather it is the other way around. RSS/BJP are called murderers of MK Gandhi even after 70 years. Ignorance is not a problem - reality and other people will educate them.But socialism is based on legal theft and therefore dishonesty. Such people are beyond redemption.</comment>

<comment>A great conspiracy is going on.Since the opn.leader fight is lost in the apex court they will do more harmthan good.THAT IS THE THINKING OF CONGIS.The budjet session is going to be twarthed by the congis and commis immediately.Afterwards they will go to Bengal for wedding and come to kerala for fighting,what a pity.Let the people of bengal give a gentle push so that both will get drowned in the Hubli river and in kerala a gentle push bothwill fall in the Arabian sea.This is what the patriotic Indians going to see in a coiuple of months time.</comment>

<comment>going by this sickular rat's nervousness..I think BJP is going to win some seats in Kerala..whats ur opinion on coming Assy elections Sir??</comment>

<comment>Nair, you know the true fact in Kerala. bjp has no chance for the next 2000 years. In Bengal , Mamata will crush the sanghis. Go somewhere else with you comic ideas.</comment>

<comment>oops so keralites are going from a sleaze corrupt to an outright anti national , lol</comment>

<comment>True Congress need not take lessons in Patriotism....towards Pakistan nd Italy.</comment>

<comment>That's absolutely right !- Madam G is completely patriotic towards Italy- Pappu G is completely patriotic towards Thailand- All other Congi's are completely patriotic towards the 2 G's.So who needs lessons on patriotism ?</comment>

<comment>Is this Surjewala one of the sons of Digvijaya Singh? Diggy called Osama 'Osamaji' and Surjewala has called Afzal Guru Afzal Guruji. They do not say for nothing that 'like father like son'. Or  it it a diktat from the Dynasty to its sycophants to address its blood relations with respect suffixing their names with 'ji'? Will he clarify for the benefit of non - Congressmen?A third possibility is that he is so afraid of terrorists that the suffix 'ji' is uttered to please them.</comment>

<comment>Congress is the back bone of all these. They want non stabilization in the country. Then only they can stall the development. Further they can again come to power with false promises and eat taxpayers money.</comment>

<comment>Patriotism was never in the blood of the Congress members, otherwise how else can one explain that they did their best to keep India in the ranks of the Third World Countries?  Even in opposition they stand shoulder to shoulder with traitors under the guise of supporting freedom of speech. Which country in the world would consider treasonous behaviour as freedom of expression?  The end doesn't justify the means.  Just because the Congress wants to regain power, it cannot offer excuses for siding with terrorists and traitors! The Congress is sealing its own fate by discountenancing the fact that so many innocent lives were destroyed, while giving honour to a terrorist by expressing solidarity with those that wished to commemorate his death. It is tantamount to abetting terrorism!</comment>

<comment>Congress don't know what is patriotism. They know only false secularism. That's the reason they don't want to hear anything from anybody.</comment>

<comment>Everyone can be branded as anti-national and can be arrested, killed in encounters and forced to commit suicide. And the real anti-nationals, goondas and vandals who abuse, insult, heckle, provoke, kill, lynch and massacre honest Indians are not even condemned. Incredible India.</comment>

<comment>This is not peculiar to India.  With the world in turmoil, many otherwise freedom loving countries have been forced to resort to preventative action, which, unfortunately, the naive term as irrational and abuse of power.</comment>

<comment>Nehru killed Neta ji... This is the patriotism of of congressi goons</comment>

<comment>Are you serving Indian National Army at that time to give such a clear idea of how Netaji Subash Chandra Bose died.</comment>

<comment>Please read the history...</comment>

<comment>Desh k barbadi chahne walo par k c dya ?</comment>

<comment>You must learn come patriotism..FK you congress</comment>

<comment>JNU should be closed down on security grounds. National Capital can not be made another Kashmir, for the greed of some dirty politicians greed. End of JNU is what Indians want now. Let the sit and scream. But those who shout pro pakistani slogans should be treated as traitors and be given maximum punishment. Con party once allowed the Muzzis to split India for the power greed of N family. They can not be allowed to do that for a second time. As for the left, it is already dead. So it can not die again.,</comment>

<comment>yeah right.. when you said "Afzal Guru Ji"..  that reinforced out conviction that congress and its leaders are anti-indians and traitors..</comment>

<comment>Sure enough ! His family has proven track record as far as patriotism is concerned. Nehru divided India to create Pakistan and Jk in collision with Edwina. Indira enforced Emergency. Sonia and Pappu are busily engaged with leftists and Afzal'jis to carve out another 'Pappustan'. This is Cong 'brand of patriotism ! </comment>
