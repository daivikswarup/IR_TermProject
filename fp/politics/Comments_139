<comment>The paid media is at it again. They are dreaming and wishing that AK  led alliance  will lose. Thats why they are putting imaginary prepoll surveys.  In one of that they say  AK alliance will lose and in other just to maintain some credibility they say  Ak alliance will win only a simple majority.  But in reality just due to the presence of AK   his allies Lalu , Nitish and Sonia will win more than 80% of the seats.</comment>

<comment>Fact was1. BJP handed over the CM post to JD(U) leader Nitish inspite of being a smaller party in the alliance in 2005.2. Most of the Good work was done by the BJP ministers of which Nand kishor yadav, the road construction minister and the Deputy CM Sushil modi who was also finance minister. This can be understood by the fact that the last two years when BJP was out of the coalition, the Bihar growth slumped inspite of having Congress support at centre and modi pushing infra projects to Bihar.3.JD(U) always lacked the cadre strength like the BJP or RJD. Reason why it had to tie up with BJP to run an effective campaign.4. Forward caste vote is only about 14%, but like powerful Yadav OBC's they come up with influential vote where they usually influence voting patter of other castes close to their vicinity in villages and towns they live in.5. Nitish even if he parted with Modi should have gone solo. That would have given him an opportunity to break the forward caste votes by luring them to development and getting a section of muslims who would have voted seeing nitish parting ways with BJP. Lalu would have been marginalized.6.Nitish wasted all the years without building the organization of the party, he filled the party with lackeys and old fools like sharad yadav who would only do his bidding.7. He didn't realize that in order to avoid anti-incumbency of 10 years, he had aligned with lalu and the full anti-incumbency of 25 years will now be upon him.8.Even if he wins by chance, RJD is bound to get more seats and RJD vote bank is less amenable to BJP (except a section of yadavs) than EBC,mahadalit vote to BJP.9.He had every opportunity to make the election around his personality but his barbs against Modi ended up making Modi centric.10. Letting Lalu move ahead with Grand alliance campaign while he moves around delhi making speeches in press trusts is going to hurt him more than anybody. He is essentially writing an epitah of his future.</comment>

<comment>THIS WAS BLUNDER DONE BY BJP LEADERSHIP WHEN NITISH WAS MADE CM WHICH WAS UNWARRANTED AS BJP HAD MORE MLAS. JD(U) IS PARTY OF DESERTERS FROM RJD WHO JOINED JD(U) TO LOOT PUBLIC MONEY. NITISH IS ONLY CAPABLE LEADER BUT HE DITCHED PEOPLE OF BIHAR AFTER GRABBING CM POST.</comment>

<comment>Congtards have already launched their burnol project for Bihar, though it is still a opinion poll.</comment>

<comment>Nitish deserves one more chance to complete his pending projects</comment>

<comment>he should go for the presidential style of campaigning like BJP did for Loksabha. he should project him vs.?.     as per poll surveys or otherwise also, he is the tallest local leader in the election with good track record in governance (ask any local native) and should go for the kill based on the same.</comment>

<comment>You forgot the other two opportunist Nitish's opportunist companions : rejected and corrupt Congress and Jungle Raaj  Laloo ? If by chance (with remote impossibility),JDU wins then be sure Bihar will be run by Laloo and if RJD wins then also Laloo |    Bihar has suffered very much during last many decades due to bad governance.This will be a last chance for Bihar to rise.</comment>

<comment>What for? So he can complete his work of running bihar to the ground? No thanks..Bihar needs nitish and lalu like it needs a case of bubonic herpes..</comment>

<comment>aapturds everywhere must be burning and frothing from all er..ends, lol.

<comment>MAHA GATH BANDHAN become MAHA LATH BANDHAN after entry of LATHAITS aka goons with sticks of LALOOJI in grand alliance.</comment>

<comment>Whenever there has been a clear-cut leader in the opinion polls as CM candidate, he will become the CM. mark my words.</comment>

<comment>your logic is wrong..example is haryana, Jharkhand and Maharastra...where Cong CM had more popularity but BJP won comfortably..</comment>

<comment>its totally wrong -nowhere cong CM was polpular they were worst</comment>

<comment>Nope, your logic is faulty..all one needs to do is review past elections, opinion polls for various state elections and you will see that the party that is projected to win most seats, usually do. And at times, we had the same situation where the cm candidate of the other party was more favored as the cm, but the other side won the election..case in example, tamil nadu elections, kerala, etc. This is why when ever the opinion polls show a party to be leading or winning the election, they usually do..irrespective of which cm candidate is preferred..And if you are planning to come back with a "opinion polls are computed differently in places like tamilnadu, all I can add here is "thanks for the laughs"..</comment>

<comment>Give me names please</comment>

<comment>Karuna, jaya and the list goes on..please do your own research as historical data of state elections, past opinion polls are all available online..again, either do the research and post factual comments rather than play dress up..no offense..In each case, the person who was most preferred as the cm ONLY won and became the cm if his party was also leading the opinion polls and did win the said elections..</comment>

<comment>You know very well what you are comparing. So no dressing up.Anyways we will take this up on the day of the results.</comment>

<comment>Agreed..until then..</comment>

<comment>its a possibility that nitish will return to NDA after polls</comment>

<comment>He committed blunder of ditching trusted friend NDA simply for muslim votes but alas he was in for a shock and had to beg before persons like Laloo and  rejected Congress to whom Noitish had been cursing all all the time.This alliance can not deliver .It is a bet.See the plight of Shri Sharad Yadav who was once most respected being the convener  of NDA but in now forced to sit besides Laloo and Sonia.I think it will be in the interest of Bihar if two estranged friends re approach sooner or later.</comment>

<comment>everything is possible in indian politics</comment>

<comment>NITISH WILL SPARE NO ONE FOR KILLING HIS DAUGHTER ISHRAT JAHAN & HER 3 PAKISTANI LOVERSWrath of NITISH WILL FALL ON INDIANS</comment>

<comment>The real alliances in Bihar are most likely going to happen after the results are out. Hopefully, people of Bihar and clear with their voting this time and pick out one party - otherwise under the grab of some fancy alliance names, political parties will try to subvert the mandate and try to form governments with post poll numbers.</comment>

<comment>are you referring to your J&K experience?</comment>

<comment>NITISH father of ISHRAT JAHANWILL TAKE REVENGE OF DEATH OF HIS DAUGHTER & HIS 3 PAKISTANI LOVERS</comment>

<comment>There is a secret plan by ultras in the sangi parivar to kick out Modi from PM's chair and install another person who is more sympathetic to Hindutva. For this reason they have to defeat Modi in Bihar elections, Once Modi is defeated in Bihar elections, their job will be easy. So ultras in the sanghi parivar will secretly do all that they can to defeat Modi.</comment>

<comment>so you idiots are also playing caste politics. then why hide behind the mask of development?</comment>

<comment>Have u seen the bar diagram representing caste wise analysis of voting. If u see Brahmin votes they vote about 70 % for BJP (orange) and 30% for MGB( Mahagadbandan). The brahmin population is only 3% total polution of Bihar if population of Bihar is 7 cr the it would be only 21 lakhs. In the same way if u see the bar diagram representing Muslim its population is about 18% of the population which is about 1.40 cr. In other words the Brahmin population is about 14% of the Muslim population in Bihar. Mischievous presentation of data!!!!</comment>

<comment>hey im not a bhakt of any party. beware</comment>

<comment>hmmmm</comment>

<comment>The pollsters as usual are looking quite bewildered and confused about the likely outcome.  Their credibility has been vastly eroded with their frequent flip-flops. We never know which pollster is speaking the truth as many are orchestrated from behind by Political parties themselves especially the BJP to create a false euphoria and winning image in its favour ahead of polls to swing the undecided voters !!I think that the arithmetical strength of the Janata Parivar combine will take it safely through the winning post..  The only determinant which is undecided is the likely scale of its victory ? Will it be a Tsunami or just a wind wave ??  Keeping my fingers crossed !?A complete wash out is needed to put in place the hubris and arrogance that has come to symbolize the ruling party which is taking the common man for a ride by its pro-Corporate leanings  !!</comment>

<comment>Lalu will be reposible for the victory of either coalition. His corrput politics give BJP the right of talking develpoment vs corruption. On the other hand Nitish owns Kurmi votes may or may not support him but because of Lalu he gets  a consolidate MUz + Yadav votes..Nitish and BJP themselves dont have much negative to talk about each other. I really hope if Nitish looses, sense prevails and he joins NDA again.</comment>

<comment>For Bihar to progress, lalu and congress has to be kept away from power. Nitish Kumar wasn't so bad, but Lalu is bound to get more seats than him and if they win, Lalu will certainly want things to be done his way whether he is CM or not.</comment>

<comment>Why are you lying,  Sadhu and pappu yadav are not with bjp ... don't know the rest of the folks ... and with lalu in with nitish,  it's very amusing to see aap con trolls getting so much of heart burn and resorting to lies and jumlabazi ( but then that's what which comes naturally to you)</comment>

<comment>Do you even know about Bihar or just blindly commenting like most of the bhakths? Pappu Yadav is backed by BJP to try to split Yadav votes.</comment>

<comment>Why don't you disclose your true name and identity?</comment>

<comment>Ok you may dislike Modi - but do you really want Lalu coalition to win? Does anyone think if Nitish is reelected Lalu will just sit quietly and let him run the state?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>No. But he is in no position to call the shots. He's just one person. He does not have the same power as Lalu. </comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>It's not - which planet are you on. Lalu's party is contesting 100 seats not 1. Besides He has a wife and children all itching to consolidate themselves. </comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>As usual you use your uncivilized abusive language. Paswan's MPs are in no position to dictate the lok sabha. Besides he is not a convicted criminal? Lalu has a proven track record of jungle raj. Lalu is actually a convict - not just someone being accused by opponents or media. Don't keep dancing around. Your original point was that convict Lalu calling shots is good for Bihar. Stick to that point - don't keep going from pappu to Paswan. </comment>

<comment>As usual you have no reasoned logical answer. Trying to make lot of noise, then slowly escape with the words - leave it. </comment>

<comment>Lol - you have no answers. Just like some of the media and most of Congress. Empty vessels make a lot of noise but have no real answers to any question. </comment>

<comment>the main problem with BJP is that they have no leader in bihar to match the popularity of nitishwa</comment>

<comment>Sushil Modi will be the best CM for the state and he will certainly bring it out of the notorious group of BIMRU, as has already been done by Raje in Rajastan and S,Singh in MP. S.Modi has not yet been tested as the CM and as Dy CM he was very effective. He is non controversial and at the same time honest and upright,like N. MOdi himself at the centre. The 1.25 lakh aid projected by the center will make the state one among the most developed, provided Nitish and Lallu are not returned. The NDA alliance will get some where 150 seats if the trend is of some indication.</comment>

<comment>real funny to see every party claiming media is against them. That indicates to me that Indian media is fairly independent. Though they do have biases(which person or organization doesn't have biases). And it is also funny to see party workers insisting media should not criticize their party or only propagate their party view.</comment>

<comment>Bjp as I heard is sweeping easily Vibrant & workaholic PM like Modias we all know is man of development.All politics of Bihar is concentrated around him.And he as we all know is hard working, development oriented man, from free health insurance to Jan Dhan he showed his capabilities.That's why BJP IS EASILY winning.</comment>
