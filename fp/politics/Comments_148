<comment>"police stations in the state auctioned to the highest bidders who then set out to maximise the opportunity through extortion from crime syndicates, liquor mafias and thugs for their bosses and let them have a free-run." - Is this true? Why is there even a government in UP??</comment>

<comment>Ajay sing , and you are just a modi andh bhakt . For god sake read the constitution of India and the fundamental rights of any citizen given by Constitution, if you believe in it. Because andh bhakts know only one constitution , modi constitution. For god sake become a citizen first my dear. Its very unfortunate that your understanding is so poor. Do read constitution before creating such discussions.</comment>

<comment>Douglas Murray’s ‘Islamophilia’”[Islamophilia] could be defined as the expression of disproportionate adoration of Islam. I don’t say – because I don’t think – that Islam has no redeeming features or that the religion has achieved nothing. But it seems strange to me that so many people today can be quite so asinine and supine when it comes to the religion. No other religion in the world today receives the kind of pass that Islam gets. Most religions currently get a hell of a time. But Islam does not.”</comment>

<comment>Narendra Modi is great.</comment>

<comment>Really your modi is great in fact greatest of great.The following is the list of alleged scams submitted to the Gujarat governor and the president:1.Land for Nano plant at low rate The state government allotted 1100 acres of land to Tata Motors Ltd (TML) to set up the Nano plant near Sanand. The land was allotted allegedly at Rs900 per square metre while its market rate was around Rs10,000 per square metre. Simply put, the government gave Tata Motors total monetary benefit of Rs33,000 crore.2.Land sold cheap to Adani Group Land was allotted to Adani Group for the Mundra Port & Mundra Special Economic Zone (SEZ) at Re1 per square metre. This is grossly lower than the market rate.3.Cheap land for ind, not for airforceThe Gujarat government allotted 3,76,561 square metre of land to real estate developer K Raheja at Rs470 per square metre, while the South-West Air Command (SWAC) was asked to pay Rs1100 per square metre for 4,04,700 square metre land.4.Agricultuure University land allotted for hotelState government allotted 65,000 square metres of land belonging to Navsari Agriculture University in Surat to Chatrala Indian Hotel Group for a hotel project despite objection from the institute. This deal was allegedly brokered by the chief minister through his office causing a loss of Rs426 crore.5.Border land for chemical firmsA huge plot of land near the Pakistan border was allotted to salt chemical companies said to be close to BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu.6.Essar Group's encroachmentState government has allotted 2.08 lakh square metres of land to Essar Steel. Part of the disputed land is CRZ and forest land that cannot be allotted as per Supreme Court guidelines.7.Land given to Bharat HotelPrime land was allotted to Bharat Hotels without auction on Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway in Ahmedabad. The company has been allotted 25,724 square metre land.8.Corruption in allotment of lakesState government, in 2008, awarded contracts for fishing activities in 38 lakes without inviting any tenders; bidders were ready to pay Rs25 lakh per lake.9.Land given to L&TLarson & Toubro (L&T) was allotted 80 hectare land at Hazira at the rate of Re1 per square metre.10.Land allotted to other industriesInstead of auctioning prime land in the major cities of the state, the Gujarat government had allotted the land to some industries and industrialists who had signed MoUs in the five editions of VGGIS.11.Cattle feed fraudThe Gujarat government had purchased cattle feed from a blacklisted company at Rs240 per 5 kg whereas the market rate is just Rs120 to Rs140 per 5 kg.12.Scam in Anganwadi centresTwo bidders apparently formed a cartel and bid for supplying supplementary Nutrition Extruded Fortified Blended Food (EFBF) to Anganwadi centres of the state. One company bid for three zones, while the other for only two. Guidelines were violated, causing the state exchequer a loss of Rs92 crore.13.GSPCDespite an investment of Rs4933.50 crore, GSPC has been able to earn only Rs290 crore from the 13 out of 51 blocks of oil and gas discovered by the company. Contractual relations of Geo-Global and GSPC deserve investigation since Geo-Global is to be hired for a higher fee, above profit-sharing.14.Luxury aircraft used by CM Instead of using commercial flights or state-owned aircraft and helicopter, chief minister Narendra Modi had used private luxury aircraft for around 200 trips in five years. The cost had been borne by the beneficiary industries.15.Rs500 crore SSY scamThe Rs6237.33 crore Sujalam Sufalam Yojana (SSY) announced in 2003 was to be completed by 2005 but it is still not completed. Public accounts committee of Gujarat assembly unanimously prepared a report indicating a scam of over Rs500 crore which was not tabled.16.Indigold Refinery land scamAround 36.25 acre farmland in Kutch district was purchased and sold in violation of all norms by Indigold Refinery Ltd.17.Swan Energy49% of the shares of Pipavav Power Station of GSPC were sold to Swan Energy without inviting any tenders.I think Lalu is less corrupt than Modi.</comment>

<comment>Aditya , its not about what modi has done by himself. For this to understand , you have to understand the constitution of India. Unfortunately modi was not the part of constitution assembly at that time. According to constitution , all citizens of India have given some fundamental rights. No one has any authority or power to remove those fundamental rights from anyone. I hope you know what are these fundamental rights. Now, the responsibility to ensure that all rights are preserved, lies with center, the union government. This can not be looked as just law and order issue. Actually , modi's fault is that he spoke after 18 days , meanwhile he has 7 rallies in BIhar. He should have spoken immediately and he should have given this message to his party members not to speak rubbish. But he did not do this. Now you have to understand that he has not murdered that man in dadari, its true. But as PM he owes this moral and constitutional responsibility to ensure that in no condition fundamental rights of any citizen should be removed or controlled by any one. He failed to do so in 2002 as CM and in all incidents happened including the murder of a writer kalburgi in Karnataka. See, some issues are not just state issues. You must understand that he is PM of Union of India. But unfortunately he is acting as a leader of BJP. If you understand this then you have moral right to ask and challenge anyone otherwise just clear your knowledge about constitutional framework of My BHARAT. And always keep one thing in your mind that first you are a Bharatiya , then you can be anything, like modi supporter or BJP supporter. No BJP and modi can be bigger then our constitution. I hope you have got it.</comment>

<comment>"Is Narendra Modi the elected Prime Minister of the Union of India or is he the daroga of Bishara that we keep asking him for answers?"Obviously he is not a daroga of dadri but surly daroga of India...If there is any thing wrong happened in country especially insanity when a human get killed over animal (no matter how scared is) PM the highest leader of the country should condemned it....remember Vajpayee suggestion over "Rajdharm"... The article itself says "finally PM broken his silence. ..He shouldn't be silent for such a long time...</comment>

<comment>A huge amount of the opposition to Modi has nothing to do with any social or political issue. It is actually economic in nature. He is altering how the Indian economy works. It is becoming more free-market in nature. Socialist governments in the past have fattened a lot of parasitic people. Essentially a patronage system was run. As it ends, a lot of the people who benefited from it have issues. This is what they hate above anything else. They didn't care so much in Vajpayee's time because direct-to-citizen transfers and other such corruption-containing measures had not been passed.</comment>

<comment>100% true. BJP was voted out in Delhi for this very reasons. It was because of actions taken by Modi to set right some of the central govt departments and beurocracy and power brokers.  And Delhi now wears a plank of honest government which is doing nothing but drama even with 95% majority in assembly. Finally Modi has taken on formidable task of unshackling India from this corrupt, deep rooted pest rots Lets us join him</comment>

<comment>That is why the recent case of BoB has happened. Harish , BJP was voted out because before February 2015 , modi was the caretaker of Delhi since May 2014, that is for almost 8 months. Modi could not do anything against corruption which was made a national issue by Arvind and Anna Hazare, not by modi. Modi's corruption is visible to all but to modi supporters.</comment>

<comment>only those who are incompetent caverib and accuse others. So is the case with Modi detractors and always spew venom against him. If they are honest and sincere, they would have surpassed Modi long time back. These detractors of Modi do not have any thing concrete to do for the welfare of the society. Even the writers also. What if they give their award back. They do not have anything positive to write . There are many writers in the country who can write better them but not honoured so far because they did not have any political backing. Hell with all these negative people</comment>

<comment>Well said.Compliments.Those who are screaming for Modi's blood won't be satisfied with what he has said.What they want is Modi free/RSS free/Hindu free India.</comment>

<comment>Already kerjwial fell in line with Modi. He started talking of  Swatch Bharat  campaign in Delhi.</comment>

<comment>Swachh bharat was Nirmal Bharat abhiyan in UPA times. It was a huge failure during UPA time and now its a matter of shame for us that even after 2014 elections , our political leaders like Modi are making fool out of us in the name of some abhiyans. Its again an utter failure of Modi after 18 months. Its clear and visible to all except modi andh bhakts.</comment>

<comment>Modi is right on spot.</comment>

<comment>Government is obstructing secular liberals intellectuals from returning their awards by not giving them any! No freedom of expression. Fascists!</comment>

<comment>Writers returning Award as protest against killing in Modi's India. I guess there was no such incident before 2014.They used to live in Ram Rajya</comment>

<comment>I wonder why these Congress Chamchas, these so-called intellectuals who are currently on an award-returning streak never return the cash prize with proper interest along with the plaque. Cheapos! If they have so much of problem with ruling party, why don't they surrender their gas subsidies, the parasites? LOL</comment>

<comment>If people are so patriotic, why not first ask the NETAS leave out the subsidy? People are just being so "selective"</comment>

<comment>Why should netas return subsidies? Are they returning any awards on flimsy grounds? What perverted logic are you trying to present?</comment>

<comment>Very soon desperate Congress chamchas will invite Paki terrorist Hafiz Sayed to come to India and fight Modi.</comment>

<comment>It was the last BJP government who returned a Pakistani terrorist who became a headache for the whole world so stop behaving like a BJP boot locker...</comment>

<comment>More abuses. Very typical of a Pakistani camel orifice violator. Do you know thatyour father's male organ is so small that he could not penetrate your mother'scavernous orifices. So she went to a farm and begged with the swine to violateher hindquarter orifice. After violating your mother's hind orifice till it wasbloody, the swine squashed their ugly hindquarters in her face & defecateddown her throat. That is the reason your face looks like a pig's hindquarters.Now you know the truth. Please do not commit suicide out of desperation.</comment>

<comment>why Dhal has become most valuable now because of all economic policies of Pappu and his maa giving MSP on sugar, wheat. Farmers leaned towards sugar and wheat.

<comment>BREAKING NEWS "India named top investment destination in business poll AFP 22 hours ago"While PM Modi is doing exactly what he should be doing bringing more business to India the hegemonic foreign owned media of India is dividing India and making us insecure with no facts. Here you go...No one goes to any country just because beef is available or not nor they not go because pork is banned (then there will be no expats in middle east) or Cat or Dog meat is banned. Media is over blowing hyperventilating and yes off course creating divisions in India and making Indians insecure. Modi is doing the right thing and here you go...first time western media is acknowledging his hard work. But, unfortunately Indians dont need foreigners to break India or keep India backwards...we have all these Congress sycophants, muslims who stayed in India after dividing India, and Christian vatican fundamentalist with Leftist who will ensure that India does not develop."India named top investment destination in business poll AFP 22 hours ago"The number of those who said ease of doing business in India was an attractive factor jumped 17.5 percent on last year, according to an EY survey (AFP Photo/Indranil Mukherjee)India has been named the most attractive country for investment in a survey of more than 500 global investors published by accounting firm EY (Ernst & Young) on Wednesday.Thirty-two percent of the 505 executives questioned said India was their favoured market for investment, with China second on 15 percent of the vote, followed by Southeast Asia, Brazil and North America."There is no doubt that interest in India has increased," Mark Otty, EY area managing partner for Europe, Middle East, India and Africa said. "Investors increasingly see the potential and understand the fundamentals."In an apparent vote of confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reform agenda, the number of those who said ease of doing business in India was an attractive factor jumped 17.5 percent on last year.India's notorious red tape, complex investment rules and poor infrastructure have long posed huge obstacles for companies, with the World Bank ranking it 142 out of 189 countries in its Ease of Doing Business index.Industrial policy secretary Amitabh Kant said Wednesday the government was "determined to make India an extremely easy and simple place to do business"."Our first priority is to do away with the many procedures and rules, followed by bringing in consistency and clarity in all our policies and tax regime and developing a world-class infrastructure," he said.India is poised to become the fastest-growing major economy this year, according to the IMF, at a time when other emerging markets are suffering slowdown or recession.Greenfield foreign direct investment (new ventures) in India rose 32 percent to $25 billion in 2014 after declining in the previous two years, according to Financial Times data service fDi Markets.</comment>

<comment>He sure is Daroga of BJP and should have contained big leaders from his party from exploiting the situation and from making irresponsible statements</comment>

<comment>What about freedom to be politically incorrect?Law and order is a state subject and presidents rule in UP cannot be imposed flippantly.For God sake Modi is not a brahmin. Any wild accusation made against him will not stick. It sticks to brahmins as they are the real minority[because of prejudice being built up by pseudo-secularists among non-Brahmins].Simply Modi can say ---"2002 riots was blamed on me in the same way Dadri is attempted to be stuck on me". Everyone in India will easily understand in a flash. But same cannot be said worldwide.===================================================My main argument is either all are communal or none is communal.Look at constitution itself..India is a Ocholocracy [rule by the mob, example reservation policy; casteism is also communalism and of a worse kind as stable vote banks are formed - which has led to emancipation from democracy of political parties and state] led by the mafia[till recently we had a genuine Italian one]. IT IS A SHAME TO CALL INDIA A DEMOCRACY.Pseudo-seculars brainwash that1)Opposite of communal is secular.2)From Point 1, Logically then opposite of Individual must be religious - an absurdity. Hence statement 1 is absurd.3)The correct antonym is Opposite of communal is INDIVIDUAL and opposite of secular is religious. Individualism comes only with CAPITALISM -positive spinoff of selfishness and profit.4)Therefore by almost Iron logic of Euclid either ALL are communal or ALL are not communal. It depends on how much India is capitalist[free economy].5)The fundamental RED communalism is therefore division between Bourgeoisie and proletariat - impeding growth of capitalism and Individualism.Reservation policy and socialism is the reason why if I were the president of India, as owner of public sector banks, PSU would HANG MYSELF in abject shame.</comment>

<comment>whatever. He has better things to do to develop the country. On the other hand if any of his party big leaders did break the law you are more than welcome to put them in jail or go to courts. If not, shut up.</comment>

<comment>He is responsible for not stopping his party-men from making inflammatory statements after the incident. Sangeet som organized a mahapanchayat and also said that he will ensure bail for the accused. He should should have publicly warned his party-men from exploiting the situation.</comment>

<comment>FIRST POST. ALERT I just heard that the Supreme Court of this country has dismissed Bhatt's case against Modi and co while severely criticizing him (Bhatt). Is this correct. What has come over this country ????!!!!! Where are your esteemed writers ? What has come over this judiciary ? How did the courts become fascist, right wing goons overnight ? Ask them to write on this as the country has to be saved from such forces. HELP HELP. You are our only hope.!!!</comment>

<comment>By Gujarat Incidence Modi didn't learn to play the media effectively, he should have dodged the "FRAMED" question.</comment>

<comment>Really fed up with the pseudo secular and pseudo intellect class that seems to be the noisemakers in India. If they are unable to tolerate the intolerance why don't they just shift their base to pakistan for they will be silenced forever by the terrorists of pakistan. shame on them. Jai Hind!!!</comment>

<comment>. HOW BJP RSS DEFEND TERRORISTS Babu Bajrangi was a RSS member who was accused in Godhra riot and here is his explanation of how Modi helped him.Bajrangi: Narendrabhai got me out of jail…… He kept on changing judges…. He set it up so as to ensure my release, otherwise I wouldn’t have been out yet... The first judge wasone Dholakiaji... He said Babu Bajrangi should be hanged — not once, but four-five times, and he flung the file aside... Then came another who stopped just short of saying I should be hanged… Then there was a third one… By then, four-and-a-half months had elapsed in jail; then Narendrabhai sent me a message... saying he would find a wayout... Next he posted a judge named Akshay Mehta… He never even looked at the file oranything…. He just said [bail was] granted… And we were all out... We were free….. Forthis, I believe in God… We are ready to die for Hindutva...http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main35.asp?filename=Ne031107To_Get.asp</comment>

Aren't their officious intrusions innuendos meant to ignite communal hatred ? Being the illiterate brawlers that they are, they'll surely deny any ulterior motive.Like trouble makers shouting chOr chOr in a mob urging it to lynch whoever they point towards.Why could they not  just keep their putrid mouths shut ?Were they trying to incite more communal disharmony ? Of course, not ! They were being well, whatchamacallit, politically correct , yes ?!When it is well known that our PM finds time to tweet to siddhu or hug Zuck , couldn't these henchmen have kept quiet and not brought attention to their party ?If you poke a hornets nest, you can't expect honey to be poured all over you thinking that you're treacly sweet, can you ?</comment>

<comment>Article 356 is the only  option for the Central Govt when the law and order in states are beyond control. When criminals are NOT behind bars, vioelnce and goondaism will get public acceptance and will become a routine incident. Unfortunately Indian judicial system is too soft to contain them and the corrupt educated bureaucrats are supporting them. Lalu out on bail is setting a wrong example to other criminals. What is the issue when People spend money from their pocket to buy and eat meat. There are many BJP leaders and RSS workers who eat beef from home or restaurants. In Hindi there is a saying dhane dhane pe lika hai khane wale ka naam. Whatever one is destined to get will get it whether it is eating or anything else.

Will Asking Education minister or rather Prime Minister be sensible according to you ???If yes, why don't anyone dare to go to Supreme Court against center govt. in dadri case ??? I tell you the answer because their own people will get punished that's why they are not going to supreme court....Jaago People Jaago ...YES MAKE NO MISTAKE THAT IT IS A VERY VERY UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT AND SHOULD NOT HAPPEN IN ANY GOOD STATE (COUNTRY).

<comment>rss lonies are the ones doing the terrorism that is why they blame it on stat aadministration.</comment>

<comment>Come man everything what is happeing in INDIA , some section in media and some people are linking to MODI . Its not proper. The unfortunate DADRI was happening in MULAYAM UP's , the recent killings of writers happened in CONGRESS ruled states.  BUT NO one is asking them questions, is STATE governments are not guilty . The earlier CHURCH attacks in DELHI during DELHI elections was found later as petty crimes and some local isssues about money. But BJP pays the price in DELHI elections. The horrific gang rape of nun in west bengal was found the culprit was BANGLADESHIS . But some minorites and some section in media jump on the street and shouting from rooftop that we are not safe .But when the truth come out all vanished. COME MAN , don;t do such low politics.</comment>

<comment>PM Modi has enough time to tweet on Ms.Dilma's brithday. But no time to speak about price rise!!! But no time to speak about hate speeches by his ministers and party men.But no time to talk about black moneyBut no time to talk about RSS raising communal tension through out India.What are you doing in other countries when problems are many in your own to fix???</comment>

<comment>He is doing best for the country , these unfortunate things has happened earlier also. And we don;t understand most of these things are happening in MULAYAM UP ,congress Karnataka and earlier in MUMBIA under CONGRESS and NCP but still people are blaming MODI .COME MAN, is state goverenments are not at fault . Don't do such  low politics.</comment>

<comment>Muzzies & Chirtians will keep crying. Ignore them.</comment>

<comment>Earlier also everything happens in Non-BJP ruled states..Why?Answer is simple.RSS is behind this.In 95% riots happened in Independent India RSS was on one side</comment>

<comment>YES , 1984 riots were RSS doing ,BHALAPUR ritos were RSS doing . RECENT Muffarnagar ritos under SP rule ware RSS doing , THE ASSAM riots under CONGRESS were RSS doing. The propblem like you people is that when ever a  nationlist governement comes you people are in trouble.</comment>

<comment>RSS DOES THE riots.why are you blaming the administration??</comment>

<comment>Even in1984 Rss Supported Congress..That is why congress got 405 seats</comment>

<comment>95% of the riots happened in muslim majority areas dennis. So which side is this? And why should riots happen anyway...if muslims asked for what they want and they got it in Pakistan what reason they have to stay in India and participate in riots and then multiply like pigs? Then you conveniently blame it on RSS. Did RSS get Pakistan?</comment>

<comment>dennis is a xtian Zombie. He is programmed by Church to oppose Hindus.</comment>

<comment>And u are RSS Chaddi...Just  propped up by Nagpur dirt to abuse others</comment>

<comment>95% of the riots happened in muslim majority areas...That is it,,,and one side there will Be RSS</comment>

<comment>Patriots, become a human first.  Why is the country not asking for Akilest's resignation? Why are there no cat calls for imposition of President's rule in the UP State.  The ONly think PM Modi is guilty is that he is not imposing President's Rule in UP.</comment>

<comment>RSS BJP is going to do terrorism and we will blame administration?by the logic r you sayng india is responsible for the terrorism pakistan does in india?</comment>

<comment>The mob in Dadri was neither RSS nor BJP. Its was the villages of Dadri that failed to protect one of their own. The second failure was the Police failed in their duty. The third failure was the state govt. did nothing to dent the communal based politics.  My point are we not taking action against the UP State Govt.  Why does these incidents happen so regularly in UP.I have been to moradabad, and must say the last time the govt did anything there the govt of emperor Akbar.  The govt of UP has done nothing for the State. Instead they have played communal politics to hide their failures.If there are enemies of Muslims in India, I would say they are the congress and SP. By My logic, I am saying that the UP Govt. of Akilesh Yadav is like the Paksitani Govt. that blames India for all their problems.</comment>

<comment>the mob in dadri were bjp members. itis out in open.dont even bother defending you rss terrorist friends.RSS BJP create riotss and then blame the state administration for it. that is like pakistan doing terrorism and blaming india.</comment>

<comment>You are completely wrong. The fact you are hiding you identity shows you are here to create propaganda and anti-indian feelings.</comment>

<comment>For all the europhia created by the heading, the content is pretty superficial & lame in its defence of the PM, H.E. Narendra damodardass Modi. For last 18 odd months, we were told that every upward movement in the economic indices were because of "Modi" ; that every positive observation on india by any Tom Dick & Harry of this world was because of "Modi" ; that the states are progressing rapidly because of "Modi"; that the citizens (domestic & NRI's) are proud & holding their heads high because of " Modi"; that the cities are cleaner because of "Modi"; that the trains are running on time because of " Modi'; that corruption has become Zero because of "Modi" - then my friend why should we not expect this most voluble, loud & 56 inch chested superman to comment on the unfortunate incident ? When for everything else, H.E narendra damodardass modi, has an opinion which must be heard & appreciated upon, why should we not expect him to comment on this incident too ? Is your defence morally right ? Maybe we need to be slightly more sensitive - more so when in concerns an human life. </comment>

<comment>People like you want the PM to comment on everything you think he should be commenting on, that is not after even having cast him your vote. The people who have voted him into power are watching and they are giving him the time to do work. Problem with his baiters like you are there aren't enough scams for you to talk about and you want him to fail, not work and talk on everything you want him to talk on. When he does in a media interview you want him to do more. Did you b@st@rds ask similar questions when the bar maid was ruling by proxy?</comment>

Did you hear rajeev wish anyone publicly for bday and hit chat in 1984? Modi is on twitter all the time wishing bonsle's son and sidhu. This makes it even more suspicious.These writers are not talking about this one event..Dadri was just the last draw that broke the camels back, it was the series of events and the atmosphere created by rss bjp.Here is just a sample in just ONE YEAR!Dabholkar killingKalrburgi murderdadri lynching,mainpuri lynching,Whipping of muslim guy in mangaloreporn ban,beef ban,inflamatory comments by Sakshi maharajinflammatory comments by sadhvi prachiinflammatory comments by Yogi AdityanathInflammatory comments by Mahesh SharmaInflammatory comments by Sangeet SomInflammatory comments by Subramaniam SwamyInflammatory comments RSS & HDL folks on twitterInflammatory comments by TagodiaVHP threats to muslims about participating in garbaPM Modi not condoling Aklakh!!!</comment>

<comment>Dadri accused are RSS BJP members and their family.Modi doesnt say a word condeming Aklaq's death for 10 daysnor does he ever condole his death.what do you make of it</comment>

<comment>That he does not cry like sickulars. The pm has made a clear message...</comment>

<comment>PM has made it clear that he will dstroy india and fool indian with vacous vapid words for as long as he is allowed to fool us.indians are not stupid.B not condoling aklaqs death pm has made VERY clear what he thinks of communal violence and of muslims.Modi the fat turd is not only communal but also incompetent cause these episodes will be exploited by ISIS to get foothold in India and when then RSS & ISIS start doing tit for tat terrorism, India will get destroyed.</comment>

<comment>You are nuts. Indians are not stupid. And they voted for modi. Decide if they are stupid or not...</comment>

<comment>modi only managed to betray indians with lies. indians voted for development agenda not for rss lunacy.</comment>

<comment>And that is what he will be judged by. Don't think indian voters are stupid...</comment>

<comment>The type of communally charged and intolerant atmosphere that is currently prevailing in India will not bring any development. Its a known fact that 90% of time RSS BJP has its hand in these event. Vishal Rana & family who are involved in dadri are members of BJP and friends with mahesh sharma.  Firstly accept that rss bjp actively push for communal divide via violence and riots. This is no way to get development. Obama on the other hand comes out andd speaks up when a topic grips his nation. he assures the citizens that he will make sure as the leader of the country that he is on the ball. Modi not condoling aklaq's death and instead mentioning "pseudo secular" conspiracies is an insult to india, that our pm speaks more like a shad illiterate terrorist than like an intellectual.On business side:India dropped from 132 (MMS) to 142 (MODI) on ease of doing business. in indexhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ease_of_doing_business_index.Vajpayee Vs Modi Vs MMS SENSEX RETURNS IN FIRST 15 MONTHSVajapee: -19% (first 15 months)Vajpayee: 1.79% (full term)MMS: 40% (first 15 months)MMS: 170% (full term)MODI: 4% (first 15 months).Daal is at rs 180---</comment>

<comment>Er, first off whenever bjp tried bringing in changes ppl said they were copying congis. So no, I still don't blv this govt wants communal riots.Communally charged is only by bjp? The first year this govt came to power there were many attacks on churches and mosques made by the minority community itself to instigate riots. Let me be very clear, there is a clear attempt by all parties to instigate riots and blame bjp.And for any of your sensex numbers to work this govt must get a better tally at rs. That is the key...</comment>

<comment>if rss bjp is pushing for congress policies that they themselves opposed when upa was in power clearly shows that rss bjp stalled indias growth.it also shows rss bjp doesnt have any new fresh ideas other than to continue congress policies ahead.RSS BJP created manufactured the biggest riots known to modern india with the demolition of babri masjid and caused death and destrution to 10s of 1000s all over india.  Couple their history for violnce, with the infalmmatory comments made by their leaders, they are the ones created the mistrust and will always be the first suspect.That is like serial rapist taking offense to being the first person to be questioned when there is a rape in the neighborhood.The fact that RSS BJP has to club together 50 years of tragedies to counter the number of communal events that happened in just ONE year, shows how weak their position is.These all just happened in just 1 yearDabholkar killingKalrburgi murderdadri lynching,mainpuri lynching,Whipping of muslim guy in mangalorebeef ban,inflamatory comments by Sakshi maharajinflammatory comments by sadhvi prachiinflammatory comments by Yogi AdityanathInflammatory comments by Mahesh SharmaInflammatory comments by Sangeet SomInflammatory comments by Subramaniam SwamyInflammatory comments RSS & HDL folks on twitterInflammatory comments by TagodiaVHP threats to muslims about participating in garbaPM Modi not condoling Aklakh!!!</comment>

<comment>BJP stopped congis because they were looting under the name of policy. So yeah they were stalling the congis from looting. 2G would not have been sold the same way under BJP. Sure they are corrupt. But not even close to Congis...</comment>

<comment>dont make excuses. you know yoou are caught when you givve lame excuse.RSS BJP si evn worse than congress when it comes to corruption and scam... they dont just kill people who will spill the beans.. vyapam has had 50 murdersin last on year.to top corruption rsss bjp is also involved in most number of terror events.this list from just one year of rss bjpDabholkar killingKalrburgi murderdadri lynching,mainpuri lynching,Whipping of muslim guy in mangalorebeef ban,inflamatory comments by Sakshi maharajinflammatory comments by sadhvi prachiinflammatory comments by Yogi AdityanathInflammatory comments by Mahesh SharmaInflammatory comments by Sangeet SomInflammatory comments by Subramaniam SwamyInflammatory comments RSS & HDL folks on twitterInflammatory comments by TagodiaVHP threats to muslims about participating in garbaPM Modi not condoling Aklakh!!!.</comment>

<comment>What excuses? It is a KNOWN FACT tht Congis looted in MOST policy they made. Why are you now making excuses for congis?- 2G- Coal- Mining- Thorium- CWGetc etcDONT make excuses for a corrupt govt!</comment>

<comment>.BJP = Corruption + Murders + Terrorism + Communalism + Education destroyer + BANS RSS BJP 50  MURDERS in one year have proven that they are just as corrupt and are even willing to KILL People, couple that with their lust for communal violence as they demonstrated with babri masjid demolition and their sustained chorus of communally hateful comments by RSS BJP leaders... makes it even worse.The only difference between RSS BJP Vs Congress, is RSS BJP MURDERS to cover up their scam and then instigate communal violence.Economically: India has dropped 10 spots in the international ease of doing business index and sensex returns under modi are 4% while they were 40% under MMS. Exports have contracted too. BJP SCAMS: 1. Kargil war coffins scam2. Fake encounter scam3. Land for Adani scam4. Swan energy scam5. Vyampam and killing spree scam6.
