<comment>What happened to that proud 56-inch (sorry, 50-inch) chest? Is he afraid what his friends Obama, Cameron and Merkel will say? If not, why has he not stopped minorities from having four wives, not abolished reservations, not built the Ram Temple, not implemented total Beef Ban even after two years in power?He is either a COWARD or a LIAR!</comment>

<comment>It is aspiration of a lot Indian people.</comment>

<comment>Watch out VHP. After the GANDHIAN Socialism of Vajpayee the BJP leaders may do what MK Gandhi did to Hindus, his supporters. MK GANDHI was after all the leader of Hindus vs. Jinnah. He sold Hindus to purchase good will of Jinnah.==================================================Where was BJP irrational and immoral in Bihar elections? Less said of murderers of merit and criminals of opposition the better. Irrational and Immoral countries die - which is why I say India is already conquered by ISIS and ISI because of reservation policy1)Appeasement to thugs of pro-reservation, by saying "BJP is for not for scrapping reservation policy" is thoroughly immoral. Casteism is also communalism . Modi committed SUICIDE when he said it and the psychological space was left vacant with contest was between Laloo and Nitish. Why would Yadavs choose Modi when they have their own caste leader in Laloo?Lesson: Election results are entirely unpredictable and depends on whims and fancies of electorate. The master election strategy is - be moral. Even if you lose the elections openly say people are immoral. Dont make "people" into holy cows as socialists will like you to do.2)Begging of votes by Modi by reservation appeasement and begging for investments from foreign nations does not pay. Investors come to get profit and wont drop even a single coin into begging bowl of Modi3)Modi should have defined tolerance as tolerance to inequality - with the bold moral strength of people to say "Let better man win". Believe me people value morality and not just base instincts.=============================================Now BJP/RSS should bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=============================================================</comment>

<comment>Insiders are predicting that in 2019 Modi will Ride a Rath Yatra from PMO to Ayodhya to commemorate an unheard of Historic Yatara from Indraprasth to Ayodhaya.</comment>

<comment>Modi ji and BJP-RSS nexus will rake up the Ram Mandir issue just before federal election, until then Modi ji only focus on world tour and cow .</comment>

<comment>sickular media are starting to ante up against the bjp as new elections approach.</comment>

<comment>I think this is a genuine demand.</comment>

<comment>Modiji ab mandir bana hi do aur reservation system hata hi do...</comment>

<comment>Ram Mandir , Article 370 , Uniform Civil Code were just propaganda of bjp to get votes</comment>

<comment>Modi dont speak much because he is busy in work.Mandir to wahi banayenge</comment>

<comment>JNU dropout like you wont understand that.</comment>

<comment>Pakistan visit mein Biryani ke badle 7 jawan shaheed ho gaya...</comment>

<comment>Wow, what is going own even the Bhakts own Sangh Parivar and its tentacles like VHP are ridiculing Modi by saying "pay a visit to Ayodhya and click a selfie at the Ram Janmabhoomi", do not they know he is the Prime Minister of India the great, what a shame. Also these (hutiya$ should know that if convening a special joint session of both houses was so easy Modi would have run away with his Land Reform and GST bill, else it indirectly proves implicates Modi that he doesn't and did not want to pass the GST bill and Land Reform bill</comment>

<comment>Modiji has compromised a lot to become PM. He has literally licked boots of rss and vhp to remove advani and other seniors out of race for PM and nominated himself s....sun na to padega na ....</comment>

<comment>I cannot believe i read this:- "If Modi and the BJP succeed in getting such an Act passed in the Parliament, Hindus will bless them with an unprecedented victory in the 2019 elections. Failure to do anything in this regard may earn them the wrath of the sant samaj, whose blessings were unequivocally with the party and its leader in the last general elections"A good for nothing fringe group is blackmailing a ruling party and the PM of the country????? Wah. This happens only in India. Modi should just ignore this bunch of thugs. If Modi and BJP do good work, people will elect them back. But nobody is going to bring them back just because a temple was built. Gosh, talk about wrong priorities of uncontrolled fringes....</comment>

<comment>I would be more charitable and call them chaddis as it has a nice ring to it... they seem to have been given a free hand to run amuck by this egotistical jodi of our honourable modi ji and motu ji.</comment>

<comment>True. One more election drubbing will make Modi and Shah act on these fringes. Three...on the trot!!</comment>

<comment>Modiji has compromised a lot to become PM. He has literally licked boots of rss and vhp to remove advani and other seniors out of race for PM and nominated himself s....sun na to padega na ..</comment>

<comment>I know that Modi grew up in the RSS environment, but when one becomes PM,  he/she will be watched by everyone nationally and internationally...every move affects the reputation....So Modi will not make the blatant mistake of involving in this religious issue.</comment>

<comment>UP assembly elections are reaching near day by day. In this situation of urgent crisis of Unemployment, continuous fall of the economy and failure of the Modi government on different fronts, RSS is using their hate mongering agency i.e. VHP to raise the forgotten issue of construction of a ''bhavya'' Ram temple.</comment>

<comment>Building temple will also boost economy. Make a temple of gold and dimond.</comment>

<comment>Modiji will go to ayodhya and click a selfie with ram lalla's temple.</comment>

<comment>VHP has no guts to make modiji speak ðŸ˜œ</comment>

<comment>Modi-G .... Mona G... Mouna G..</comment>

<comment>Definitely Modi should break his silence & make it clear to the VHP that the Govt will obey the verdict of the Supreme Court... Ha ha ha....</comment>

<comment>Modiji mandir banao</comment>

<comment>Bhakto ki pyas bujhao !</comment>
