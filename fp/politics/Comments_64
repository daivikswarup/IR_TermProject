<comment>Conducive atmosphere for peace is to Demolish all mosques in India. The problem is India is already conquered by ISI/ISIS because of reservation policy. It cannot summon its will.===================================================================Indian constitution IS racist.The ONLY DISCRIMINATION BY BIRTH WHICH INDIAN CONSTITUTION DOES IS RESERVATION POLICY - THEREFORE IT IS ANTI-UPPER CASTE [MODERN DALITS] RACISM.Racism should be traced to constitution. Random discrimination/attacks will always take place - like random shootouts take place. Does constitution of USA direct madmen to shoot children? That is the price of freedom.Racism can be traced from the constitution of a country. For example USA constitution had actual laws sometime in History which was racists.  Social effects can linger for sometime - but it declines rapidly. Rather the only "racist" outcome was the rapid decline in British population from 8 lakhs in 1947. One can then argue that the  racism after 1947 was anti-white racism. One can argue that quit India movement was anti-white racist[in the backdrop that Indian Independence fighters were overwhelmingly socialist and socialism is Ocholocracy[mob rule]..Racism originates from stateism. Constitution of India is guilty of evils like allowing triple talaq, 4 wives, murder of merit by reservation policy and killing property rights by socialism.Majority consensus, say, to loot Tata [like in Singur, where he was driven out like a madman] or to murder merit by reservation LOOKS like democracy - but it is Ocholocracy[mob rule]. Ocholocracy by definition frequently murders INDIVIDUAL right.Majority rule with INDIVIDUAL right protected by state is democracy.</comment>
