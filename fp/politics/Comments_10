<comment>TYRANNY OF THE ELECTED! </comment>

<comment>I dont support the anti nationals and want them to be punished.. Nation always comes first..  Those who were involved should be stripped of their nationality and rot forever.. I m just concerned about BJP's double standards.. Supporting Afzal guru is surely anti national.. He is a terrorist and would remain one forever.. Similarly supporting Nathu Ram Godse is anti national.. He was also a terrorist and a coward who had no betterway to protest but kill.. I want bjp to use the same yardstick to punish those who support the terrorist Godse.. That is also anti national.. And please dont try to teach nationalism to us.. Goondaism and arrogance is not nationalism... We know how is BJP n ABVP.. If they are so nationalistic, they should break their alliance with PDP who are also pro afzal guru and thank pakistan... I dont know where the nationalism of bjp and bhakts vanish when it comes to godse and PDP..</comment>

<comment>Our country is ruled so long first by Mughal rulers because of Jai Chands at that time ,then by British , again because of another type of Jai Chands  and present day Jai Chands are peoples like this writer , media like this Firstpost , parties like CPI (m) ,Congress ,leaders like Kejriwal ,who openly supports these Jai Chands</comment>

<comment>Is the author so blinded by his hatred for BJP that he is defending anti Indian slogans under freedom of expression ? Such places like JNU have in past even celebrated naxalite movements ... They are leftist and want soviet style government in India ... Look at how they have ruined West Bengal ... Kolkatta is today no longer competing with Mumbai and Delhi ... Even cities like Bangalore Hyderabad Pune Ahmedabad have marched ahead forget MumbaiPost independence it was second most important trade and business hub in India after Mumbai and today it is doing pathetic ... Kerala with its 100 percent literacy rate does not attract googles and fscebooks of world ... This JNU people want India to be failed like Soviet Union and then finally be divided into small countries </comment>

<comment>The slogans heard in JNU had no place anywhere in the country. Protesting against the capital punishment of Afzal Guru is one thing, but chanting slogans in the line of 'we will continue your work and won't back down until India goes down' and celebrating the life of a convicted terrorist are entirely different things. What is the justification for that? That too, conducting that at the wake of the Siachen avalanche?I don't think any country in the world would accept that. An apple to apple comparison would be the question, would America be okay with people chanting pro-Bin Laden slogans and celebrating his life and claiming to continue his work? I am more than certain if someone does that in the US they would have a very up close and personal experience of anti-terror forces. Would France accept the glorification of the Paris attackers? German generally don't even speak about the Nazi era.I am all for student individualism, independent thinking, rational questioning, protesting against government policies that they feel are wrong. I do believe the ability to question the government policy is very important in building a strong nation. But those have to be constructive. What is constructive about the event that happened in JNU? How is hate towards your own country constructive? How is glorification of a convicted terrorist constructive? How is promise to continue down his path constructive? The protest was not against the government but the country and the government has a responsibility to handle it.I don't know if the students deserves to go to jail for it, but the Government has to take a stance. What would have happened to them if they were not students and not inside their campus? They would have gone to jail. Just because they were in college, is it okay to do what they did? I am more than certain, Congress or Communist Party (if either of them were in power) would have taken similar actions. If they do not, they will be setting a precedent for more such events. I think the case has to go to court and let us see what the court says on the issue.</comment>

<comment>Why BJP is taking the blame of being only nationalist party? What special relationships do the Anti Nationals enjoy with other parties?</comment>

<comment>Is the writer suggesting that had it been Congress, Left or UPA in the government then the Anti National would have got freedom to wage war against the nation and Govt would have supported it ?It's Dangerous how much trust and relationships the Anti National has with those parties.</comment>

<comment>People of all religions, color, cast and regions are in defense and protecting this country, this country belongs to all.Entire nation is united against the anti national. </comment>

<comment>And anti nationals are those say against BJP</comment>

<comment>Firstly, the sedition law has no place in a democracy in the 21st century. It is a shame that the law exists on the statute books, even though it has been read down by the courts in the past to exclude everything but direct and imminent incitement to violence.Parliamentarians will not scrap it, as it provides an easy tool to threaten dissent. Therefore, no party has tried to get this law removed. The courts must take a look at the law and scrap it for unconstitutionality.Secondly, the BJP is constantly in suicide mode. This is another example where they have chosen to tie themselves up in knots due to the sheer stupidity of arrogance. Rajnath Singh's statement on the LeT supporting the protests in JNU is so far fetched and made without any basis, they make him sound delusional.I think it is clear now that Modi and the BJP's days are numbered. They will most likely not win a single state election until 2019 and have also paved their way for a crushing defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.</comment>

<comment>Government is duty bound under oath to uphold and protect sovereignty of this country. Irrespective of whichever party is in Gov't must fulfill its duty.</comment>

<comment>And it is much beyond arrogance when a govt. orders a lathicharge at midnight on a sleeping crowd of men, women and children because they have assembled under a Hindu spiritual leader Baba Ramdev and kills an aged woman in the process.</comment>

<comment>Ajay Singh, if you think you are the expert on everything including security of the nation, why don't you be the PM of India? You know you are not. So, why you comment on matters for which you have no information? The government has several security agencies to advise and based on the inputs they provided it takes decision. Do you mean to say that the government should consult you and other armchair critics before taking decision on security matters? Leave it to the professionals who are good on security matters. You have various matters to write about. Why don't you cover the government programs and policies, including "Make in India", "Swacch Bharat" etc. which will impact the lives of millions of Indians. Is JNU such an important issue that all and sundry journalists write about it? For a change please write about Make in India which was launched in a big way in Mumbai a few days. We would love to read about. At least please try and let us know what you think.</comment>

<comment>If its not a big issue, why all BJP workers talk about that? You should tell them your opinion.</comment>

<comment>People talk about it because media is projecting it in a big way. That is why media should concentrate more on developmental rather than arresting some obscure individuals who are out to destroy our nation. Let the security agencies handle it and they are handling it efficiently. Journalists have no role to interfere in security matters.  They are writing to appease their political masters.</comment>

<comment>“The problem with the BJP and the Sangh Parivar is that they find emotive issues more handy than tackling real and political issues,”  by - KN Govindacharya. A Prime minister who perpetually plays to the gallery, a Finance Minister whose financial knowledge is questionable and over and above the RSS with its philosophy, what else would you expect from this government. Mr. Govindacharya with one sentence you describe the whole malady of this govt.</comment>

<comment>Finally, we have a MAN at the helm in India and a government that is not willing to tolerate any "Nonsense" in the name of "liberal thinking", "freedom of expression", "secularism"...etc. It is high time that these self proclaimed "intellectuals" of JNU and other left leaning "thinkers" or rather  "thought mastrubators" be told and shown that they cannot use such fluffy words and ideas to cover up downright anti-nationalism. They have gotten away too long with such nonsense. In the past we have not had leaders who could use force without any fear against jokers who would protest against Afzal Guru's, Ajmal Kasab's , Saddam Hussein's ...etc execution. It is very re-assuring to know that we have a leadership and government that is not willing let this nonsense to go on. Now these self proclaimed "intellectuals" and "liberals" will scream intolerance. If knocking down the bones and whatever of people insulting and abusing India and its heritage nd culture is intolerance, then intolerance is good. Great Going Modi government, we would have loved had this approach come early. Anyways "Dhaer aaye dhurusth aaye".</comment>

<comment>Are you even suggesting Saddam's execution was correct? *applause* That too in 2016 when you see what has happened with ISIS emerging out of those events!Be patriotic, not nationalist. Be proud of the good aspects of the country and work to fix the bad aspects. Don't oppress others who have a different opinion. All of us people make this country a great country, and we need to protect it not only from external threats but also internal threats like the hardline Right or the extreme Left.</comment>

<comment>Saddam killed approx 1,00,000 Kurds and Yazidis. He used chemical weapons over Kurd villages.Leave other atrocities like Kuwait war etc.....but his genocide against Kurds/Yazidis was enough for sending him to gallows.............</comment>

<comment>Another Bull-Crap from the arsenal of Presstitude... FP should rename themselves as CongressPost</comment>

<comment>seems there is big team to give headline for every F*r*t post....</comment>

<comment>Sir, "He belongs to a party (Communist Party of India) whose belief in Indian constitutionalism can hardly be questioned" Really ? Please read . and EDUCATE YOURSELF with some home truths : "The Only Fatherland : Communists, Quit India and the Soviet Union "- Arun Shourie (1991). Of particular interest, please read and re-read the letters from the then úndivided'CPI General Secretary P.C. Joshi to Sir Reginal Maxwell - , Member Home Viceroy's Council - the 'Dear Sir Maxwell'letters. It is not some made up MYTH by Arun Shourie. It is from the records held at the National Archives, New Delhi.Further on the Left-Lib MAFIA, Samuel Huntington wrote : "“The prevalence of anti-patriotic attitudes among liberal intellectuals led some of them to warn their fellow liberals of the consequences of such attitudes for the future not of America but of American liberalism. Most Americans, as the American public philosopher Richard Rorty has written, take pride in their country, but 'many of the exceptions to this rule are found in colleges and universities, in the academic departments that have become sanctuaries for left-wing political views.' These leftists have done 'a great deal of good for . . . women, African-Americans, gay men and lesbians. . . . But there is a problem with this Left: it is unpatriotic. It repudiates the idea of a national identity and the emotion of national pride.' If the Left is to retain influence, it must recognize that a 'sense of shared national identity . . . is an absolutely essential component of citizenship.' Without patriotism, the Left will be unable to achieve its goals for America. Liberals, in short, must use patriotism as a means to achieve liberal goals”For : America - Read : India. Makes a lot of sense, doesn't it ?</comment>

<comment>Communist are the people who support china during Indo-China war in 1962,  what else can we expect from them?</comment>

<comment>And RSS stood with British during freedom movement by Gandhi.</comment>

<comment>Gandhi was volunteer of British Army of South Africa in Boer war against the native blacks.........................we can dig history till Neanderthal species......</comment>

<comment>Fudge  & turn around arguments to justify disruptive rowdy behaviour by worthless elements in the campus (who then grow into politicos of discredited isms)  into goody goody students!  Yet another writing...We should now coin a phrase - the argumentative fudgers - to describe the reams in MSM written/talked/howled out -  justifying the victimhood draping up of whats happened in JNU</comment>

<comment>JNU trouble is sickular parties coughing in their death bed.</comment>

<comment>You are quoting Govindacharya. His ego is bigger than himself and today he's a nobody. Occasionally, he comes out and gives a press conference to show the world he's still alive. The commies are totally irrelevant today. These people supported the emergency and Yechury says what the Govt. did is worse than emergency. The congress, has been hand-in-glove with the commies whenever it suited them and the congress today under Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi is the most dangerous party for this country. When Modi said Congress Mukt Bharat, he said it with full understanding of what he was saying.</comment>

<comment>Indian soldiers and ABVP students are doing great service to Country. Traitors to be crushed. Congis fake gandi rahul, mama sonia, their sickular friends and maoist commies must be exposed for thier antinational agenda.</comment>

<comment>At-least cut the government grants on JNU.</comment>

<comment>Cut government grants? I say remove government grants to JNU. When will this debate turn into what it really should be. What should be done with JNU?</comment>

<comment>Communists of India have only harmed this country. Negativism is their hallmark. Their ideology is obsolete and idiotic. Wherever they were in power in the States of India, they have blocked progress and committed acts of violence. Communist leaders of India have been fooling the poor people of the country. Even in states where they have enough opportunity to uplift they poor and downtrodden,(their only declared goal) nothing was done. But the leaders have amassed phenomenal wealth.With their loyalty being with China and Russia, less said about their love for India and Indian Constitution, the better.Therefore, they are a rejected party today in the country and are fast losing relevance. It is so, all over the world. Being a member of this party, therefore, does not add any credit to Kumar.Kumar was there at the meet leading the proceedings of the traitors’ meet. Or was he there as an innocent observer? Communists are able to easily fool the youngsters with their tricks and cunning. So it is no wonder that Kumar or any other communist candidate getting elected. And If a person who is elected by majority vote has to be noble, then our political systems and governments would not have been what they are today. Only crooks and criminals get elected in our system.And the author claims that BJP has acted out of arrogance more than out of nationalism. The right thinking people of entire India are shocked by what Kumar and his gang did at the JNU meet. They glorified terrorists, and threatened to destroy India. Is it arrogance to act against those committed these unpardonable crimes? Communists cannot understand nationalism. They are used to arrogance only.It is recommended by the author that we should take a more conciliatory route and compromise with the traitors who openly admired terrorists and threatened to divide India into bits. This exposes what the communists and their allies want to happen. These people have always lied their way to power. Such lies will not work any more because facts are too clear to the people of the country.</comment>

<comment>The leftists should read more. The internet offers vast information. Please try to verify the following facts in the net (1) The British East India Company was owned by a single individual (2) In the beginning of 19th century, China was the richest nation in the world followed by India (3) The Europeans sold opium forcefully in China. The opium dens were used to opitae the civilians. In India the opium cultivation by force created many famines. (4) At that time India never faced any malnutrition because of the great quantity of pure cow's milk. The cows used to be more than the human population. Also the forests of the sub continent was able to provide sustenance for more than one lakh tigers and its herbivorous preys and rich vegetation. Now many forests and vegetation had vanished the tigers total around 2500. Also the milk revolution helped to wipe out the desi cows. (5) CIA was instrumental in installing Mao in China. The Chinese revolution was planned and executed by the CIA. (6) Nobody cares about the demand for a seperate state status for jammu and Ladakh, considred as colnies of Kashmir due to  the stupid Article 370. The Union Territory status for Ladakh was a long-standing demand. So the best solution is to make Kashmir a buffer state like Bhutan or a guarded neutrality similar to Switzerland and then grant statehood or UT status for jammu and Ladakh</comment>

<comment>Can the author hold his views to himself. The mater is in the court and it will decide based on what evidences are presented.</comment>

<comment>They will not, as don't go with names ..This first post also seems to be governed by some anti bjp guy who can go to any length for maligning them..Anti BJP samajh aati h but anti national is weird ..</comment>

<comment>CPI is a dead party which has some life left inside JNU. It is time for India to reclaim her lost glory and culture from the ever invading enemies and traitors from within.  Congi and commie traitors should relocate elsewhere if they continue their treacherous activities.</comment>

<comment>bhakt trolls are busy calling any reports on JNU as written by presttitutes....grow up , and smell the coffee..... the planned attack on students , journos by lawyers last afternoon is yet another example of "if u are not with us u are against the nation: which is no different from teh congress own "indira means india" campagign of the 70s</comment>

<comment>Hum toh Bhakt ke Bhakt hi reh gaye. Par tum toh Chutiye se Deshdrohi ban gaye.</comment>

<comment>pheku bhakts let the nation what happned to the black money...what about teh claim that no one woudls tep to indian soil if modi is PM....</comment>

<comment>I don't  know about u sir,  but anyone calls the slogan " bharat ki barbaati tak jung ladegi" is a traitor for me.  I am not BJP yet,  but will join them anytime soon if this is the condition in our country.</comment>

<comment>and RSS  supported godse who was hung for the assassination of gandhi....so what does it  tell u</comment>

<comment>I am not a RSS sympathizer either.   Why are you assuming that everybody against JNU protest is either BJP or RSS ??</comment>

<comment>sir, it is for me too... wathc the video which says who were the real guys...of coruese bjp has called the vide as doctored</comment>

<comment>Anybody who is nationalist is a bhakt for you. I feel nothing wrong being a bhakt of the nation. We are ready to call spade a spade even when the govt does something wrong. Everybody asked for govt to act when the slogans were telecast on media. Now when the law-enforcement agencies are acting you have problems with that.</comment>

<comment>ooh.... the moderate bhakt are we.....</comment>

<comment>So u r taking responsibility of those who raised anti national slogans ...Very easy way I am telling you just go and take their guarantee and of the incident ...In future any thing happens u will be responsible ..Also ask these people to have sympathy with those died while protecting our Parliament ..:)</comment>

<comment>RSS  supported godse who was hung for the assassination of gandhi....so what does it make u</comment>

<comment>watch the video which exposes who shouted tehse slogans..........of course u would say it is doctored</comment>

<comment>(1) It is perfectly all right to take action as per law against those who indulged in anti-India sloganeering. However, let us not be carried away by demand for framing sedition charge on the basis of inadequate information or outlandish ideas about nationalism. (2) Ideology is often overlooked in our country. Opportunistic politics is normal rule which all politicians follow to grab power. We have seen this happen in all states. (3) Jammu & Kashmir is an example of such pue opportunistic politics. Here, BJP & PDP were having an alliance despite the fact that PDP is for azadi (whatever that means) and BJP is in favour of withdrawing special status accorded to Jammu & Kashmir. Nationalism has lost its true meaning and it has become a handy tool to be used to criticise opponents and even arrest them. All citizens who are for democracy should oppose politicians who are essentially selfish and who hold and express anti-democracy views.</comment>

<comment>Ajay Singh should see what is condition of Bihar today, may make him shut up if really cares about nation.</comment>

<comment>Sify.comNewsColumnsQuestions on which JNU is silent about...Questions on which JNU is silent about...Source :	SIFYBy :	Ashley TellisLast Updated: Mon, Feb 15, 2016 15:25 hrsShareRape ProtestsThe nation is in an uproar about what is happening in JNU. The great intellectual freedom of the greatest University of the country is under threat. Or is it? JNU is actually one of the emptiest Universities in the country. Students pose as great radicals but actually do nothing that steps outside the party line. The thunderous outburst against the government's rather silly charge of sedition against some utterly meaningless protest is inversely proportionate to the chilling silence on the rapes and sexual violence that unfolds on that campus pretty much every day. Let us ask a series of questions about one such case.Why is there a strange silence around the rape of a foreign student in Jawaharlal Nehru University that happened last year?Why were there two peculiar news reports in January 2016, one informing us that the accused Professor has been sacked based on the findings of the GSCASH, the Gender Sensitisation Committee Against Sexual Harassment in JNU, and the other informing us that people within Jawaharlal Nehru University have been warned not to speak about cases on campus anywhere outside?Why did the articles refer to the incident as one of sexual harassment and not rape?  Why has an FIR not yet been filed by the University against the accused Professor, especially given the clearly guilty verdict pronounced by its own structure, the GSCASH?Why do the two reports not name him (since when do we have protection of the victimiser's name)?Why did the complaint take so long to be filed with GSCASH?Why did GSCASH warn a student organisation after they put up a poster on the issue which had no named anyone or violated anybody's privacy?Why did GSCASH take so long to come up with its report? Why was the report undercut by JNUTA, the Teacher's Association of JNU (one institution in the same University undercutting another)?What are a large number of teachers in JNU afraid of and why were they against the sacking of the accused Professor?Why did the issue go up to the Executive Committee (EC) level after the clear GSCASH report?Why did outside members on this Committee have to force JNU's hand on the sacking of the accused Professor?Why is JNU issuing mysterious reports to the press like the ones referred to above?Why were the student bodies, especially the student body in power in the JUNSU, otherwise eager to respond to every gender-based violation in the country, silent on this rape within their own campus?Why did only a handful of JNU Professors write a mealy-mouthed letter condemning the JNUTA's attempt to scuttle the GSCASH decision?Why is the media content to simply carry reports issued by Universities with no independent investigation of the issue?Why and how in this age of the social media was there an almost complete media blackout on the issue, apart from the odd rightwing nutter on facebook and twitter trying to gain political mileage out of it and not addressing the issue seriously at all?Why has Kavita Krishnan, Secretary, All India Progressive Women's Association (AIPWA) and politburo member of the CPI (ML) Liberation, linked to the party in power in JNU, otherwise spokesperson against gender-based violence across the country, been completely silent about it?What does this say about the power of the accused Professor and the power of otherwise so-called progressive groups that have maintained a silence on the issue?What does such a malignant silence about a rape in India's premier University say about the culture of gender-based violence in JNU and in Universities across the country?What is the hope for justice for the student and for students like her across the country?By contrast, the noise and hullaballoo over the so-called seditious meeting just will not stop. DSU, the student party that organised the meeting, has done nothing about Kashmir ever apart from have such useless meetings at key flashpoints.What have they done to sustain the campaign against the occupation against Kashmir?The fact is that JNU has become (always was?) some sort of emblematic and empty (like most emblems) icon of the Left in India. Like all stripes of the Left in India, the political parties in JNU, linked to these stripes, only know how to toe the party line and scream themselves hoarse about what is safe and stay silent on anything that questions their foundation.It is time we found our political voices in spaces other than the casteist, classist and utterly pretentious hellholes like JNU.As Kerala Dalit rights activist Ajith puts it: "Rohith's was an institutional murder. The question of institutional /systematic caste violence was raised. Now they want to "Save JNU"! So no problem with JNU as an institution? No institutional violence there? No institutional casteism? No internal differences /discrimination? Akhand Bharath to Akhand JNU? I would like to be anti-caste, anti-nationalist than save an institution unproblematically."</comment>

<comment>How arrogant the Indian media get? How low are you going to stoop? Instead of condemning the elected president who was at anti India demonstration and who should have stopped it, it is ironic that this terrorist prestitute is justifying it. Tell me something you stupid Ajay Singh. Who pays for these idiots to be educated or instead of education doing anti India demonstration? We the Indian tax payers. Do you know they pay 400 rupees only per year and we have to pay 3 lacs per year per student mind it per student 3 lacs per year on JNU students subsidizing their education. WHY? Let them pay full price 3 lacs per year and then see how many people demonstrate and how many do serious studies. When you get it for free you don't care for this education. Time has come for us to question the arrogance of these beggars who in the name of studies are wasting tax payers money. Shut up pay and get educated or take a hike to Pakistan you all terrorists who call themselves Indian but are terrorists in garb of students.</comment>

<comment>(Communist Party of India) whose belief in Indian constitutionalism can hardly be questioned.  - the party that allows load of illegal bangaledshi immigrants for creating vote banks can't be questioned. lol this is how you should write a utter trash writing and call it journalism.</comment>

<comment>Bjpiglets are running around creating hatred to try and achieve political gains and the economy is neglected totally is this the achhe din we were promised? The other political parties are of course doing their bit to add to the mess. </comment>

<comment>So anti India demonstration is a good thing as per you? Instead of studying for which we the Indian tax payers are paying 3 lacs per student and they pay nothing you are telling me BJP is at fault? People like you divided India twice. No wonder you want to destroy India one terrorist at a time.</comment>

<comment>where? i have no sympathy for JNU, a university without placement.</comment>

<comment>ABOUT stopping FUNDING FOR jnu when more deserving cases are there.</comment>

<comment>Niku has learnt  well from vulturewaal. .He shamelessly denied saying any such thing 2day</comment>

<comment>the only one who acted impartially is Kejriwal . he has ordered DM inquiry. let the truth come out and prevail for further action.</comment>

<comment>Police is also investigating. .so how is a DM impartial and police partial ??</comment>

<comment>so you are doubting a megistrate. DP least said the better, have you heard of HMV?</comment>

<comment>Hehe ..least said the better ? Why cause vulturewaal said so,  and are you really such a nincompoop that u have not heard of corruption in judiciary</comment>

<comment>its a central university.. delhi govt ka koi role nahi h ...</comment>

<comment>did any body else other than you raise this issue. if it is so. are you the only wise person left in the country?</comment>

<comment>Others did too,  but zombie ko wah wah karne se fursat nahi rahti:)Btw you guys were cheering for cancellation of mgmt quota in schools ..when we said it's not his jurisdiction you guys abused ..when HC pronounced it illegal all of you sat with tails between ur legs. , but no lessons learnt :)</comment>

<comment>we are talking of JNU as central univ. if you are hard at understanding then please keep off.</comment>

<comment>Abe idiot jnu mein bhi jurisdiction nahi hai aur school ke case mein bhi nahi tha (are u really low iq? ?)..but you guys keep cheering without knowing facts</comment>

<comment>first learn etiquette  to talk.</comment>

<comment>Sorry moron  (or pretending to be moron ) ke sath etiquette na Ho payega :)Btw when you were calling people  imbalanced and bigot that was etiquette ??</comment>

<comment>DO i DO TU TADAK. O i EVER ABUSE. DO  I EVER DO ANY VULGARITY?</comment>

<comment>I saw you first time today so don't know about this "ever "thing :)And u r first comment was to call someone imbalanced and bigot ..so u tell</comment>

<comment>An odd even to show for 1 year of misgovernance and that too it works for traffic congestion and not pollution. .are u from Delhi?  Then all I can say is vulturewaal is extremely lucky to have such liberal voters :) great njoy </comment>

<comment>did it improve life of Delhi wallahs or not?</comment>

<comment>Not for lot of travellers who had to travel in crowded metros. .and not for folks who went to office early and came late just to avoid OE. .but u njoy</comment>

<comment>i hate these kind of hypocrites and pathological liers.</comment>

<comment>All sane people do</comment>

<comment>What happened to the stern message given to Pakistan after Pathankot attack???What happened to the 72 hour Deadline???Has Maulana Massod Azhar been brought back to India for his crimes???</comment>

<comment>And this rant is relevant in this case because ??</comment>

<comment>Yes. because BJP certifies who is national and who is anti-national. Moreover you claimed Rajnath Singh gave stern message . We know other than talk these guys can do NOTHING</comment>

<comment>haha... but actually spoke truth...</comment>

<comment>Umar khalid shouts anti-India slogans and Police arrest Kanhaiya Kumar??? and BJP and RSS speak of Hindutva. What a bunch of Jokers</comment>

<comment>THE ONLY ISSUE IS TO CONDUCT AN IMPARTIAL INQUIRY AND PUNISH THOSE FOUND GUILTY. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT?</comment>

<comment>Left ideology is corrupt and useless</comment>

<comment>Leftists are people who justify Stalin killing and torturing millions in the name of social equality. You cannot expect sense from them</comment>

<comment>JNU students r on strike. This essentially means they will continue their job of doing nothing and dreaming of Bharat ki barbadi</comment>

<comment>JNU scums are free loaders . 3.5 lakh per student per year : that is what we tax payers spend to uncles at JNU.</comment>

<comment>Just like 100% Hike for Parlimentarians for doing no work???</comment>

<comment>AK 400 % hike.. n there is no work at RS only.. n i guess  everyone knows d reason...</comment>

<comment>But AAP is working hard. No disruptions in Assembly and people of Delhi are very Happy. Nothing wrong to give yourself a Hike when you perform.</comment>

<comment>Yeah no disruptions as they throw every one dissenting out of the assembly  , even their own mla..let bjp try this in LS and u will be the first one  barking about Hitler and fasicm</comment>

<comment>The BJP MLA who was thrown out was abusing and assaulting an woman...We would expect such crooks to be no less than jailed..!!! he must.thank god..that .police is still in BJP's control...otherwise that guy could have been jailed!!</comment>

<comment>LOL,  and when sharad yadav makes cheap remarks on Irani in RS,  you gloat. .shamless aap zombiesBtw vulturewaal has thrown out vijender goel and pankaj pushkar also and they were not assaulting any women ..only protestingTell me tum logon ko apne doglepan se ghrina nahi hoti? </comment>

<comment>It s allowed to do so under the Constitution. Anyways BJP only believes in Violence and Disruptions. Wont make any difference whether they are in Assembly or not</comment>

<comment>Constitution to LS mein bhi allow karta hai. .but once mahajan suspended few MPs , you morons were bleating about fascism and  Hitler modi. .but why anyone should be surprised by hypocrisy of aap zombies</comment>

<comment>Throw Congress out of India. Who cares. I never cried.</comment>

<comment>You did , I read your comments during parliament impasse don't lie</comment>

<comment>I am not Feku to lie.</comment>

<comment>Only his zombie :)</comment>

<comment>and i support AAP. what has tht got to do with anti national scum at JNU ?</comment>

<comment>You have arrested all the wrong people and all anti-nationals have escaped. Hafeez Saeed is laughing at India</comment>

<comment>so argue for arrest of correct culprit, not that nothing wrong happened at JNU.</comment>

<comment>I am not arguing for or against JNU. I am only arguing based on available facts. I am also saying dont Character Assassinate people based on gossips and Half Truths. Dont ruin a persons life for some political Gain</comment>

<comment>i do trust the courts. if Kanhaiya is innocent, this will end v badly for chaddi party.</comment>

<comment>But he has already been labelled an anti-national. His character has been assassinated already nation wide. Arnob Goswami has defamed him beyond repair. Even if he is proven innocent media wont apologize. They will shove the matter and their Lies under the carpet and ask Kanhaiya to fend for himself</comment>

<comment>agree, the solution is to quickly arrest the actual culprits  and if acquitted Kanhaiya should file defamation suits against tv channels etc.</comment>

<comment>Suing TV channels wont help. He has already been defamed.</comment>

<comment> Muzzafarnagar kind of Politics has reached its Expiry date?? Portraying every rival as a threat to national security, tacit supporter of Pakistan, sympathiser of Kashmiri separatists and being soft towards terrorists and Naxalites are essential components of the BJP's strategy.</comment>

<comment>This cokksukking joker is at it again. If you can't see right from worng, stop assuming a sanctimonious tone, you dipshitt.</comment>

<comment>Jnu guys celibrated dantewada massacre</comment>

<comment>When srinivas can't  counter you with facts he calls u a liar. .typical zombie</comment>

<comment>Stop this Srihari. Dont accumulate your sins by spreading Half truths. Tomorrow somebody can do the same with your family and make you out-castes</comment>

<comment>haven't seen the video or r u so blind in bjp hatred that you have started hating India too ?</comment>

<comment>You have been talking of video since last 3 days. But not one video shows what you claim</comment>

<comment>i saw one on times now and Dna website today. seen it yet ?</comment>

<comment>It shows nothing to prove Kanhaiya Kumar guilty</comment>

<comment>so something wrong happended at JNU campus, do you agree with tht much ?</comment>

<comment>Yes. I agree. I also agree that BJP handled the situation very badly and dangerously</comment>

<comment>for sure. so not agree to strict action against perpetrators ? if kanhiya is innocent, he will be released by court. why not just say that law should be strictly applied in this case.</comment>

<comment>how do you identify a traitor to his country or community or race? He runs away from to UK leaving his brothers to die.</comment>

<comment>For ur our new home secretary srinivas  umar Khalid kanhyya kr are all innocent despite of video of umar shouting slogans Modi RSS abvp shouted those</comment>

<comment>Is Umar khalid arrested or not?</comment>

<comment>He is on run </comment>

<comment>It shows how inept your Home Ministry is</comment>

<comment>Strange...the other day...he was giving interviews on times now and other channels!!!</comment>

<comment>Once the video surfaced he ran away </comment>

<comment>Hindu-Muslim divisive Politics Failed in Delhi and Bihar Polls.Amit Shah's new Strategy??? Portraying every rival as a threat to national security, tacit supporter of Pakistan, sympathiser of Kashmiri separatists and being soft towards terrorists and Naxalites are essential components of the BJP's strategy. Arnob Goswami seems to be peddling his Lies very well???</comment>

<comment>Video clearly showed umar Khalid shouting anti india slogans </comment>

<comment>But Police arrested Kanhaiya instead???</comment>

<comment>Then Why arrest Kanhaiya Kumar???</comment>

<comment>Then why ur saying video showed nothing</comment>

<comment>Traitor &  B@stards r supporting anti national...</comment>

<comment>Hey congi and crAAPtard morons, check the link where kanhaiya kumar was raising anti-national slogans.www(.)dnaindia(.)com/india/report-watch-new-video-shows-kanhaiya-kumar-part-of-the-crowd-raising-anti-india-slogans-2178244Will you change your mind.</comment>

<comment>This is from the link you gave:"At one point, Kanhaiya is also seen standing close to some police officials and checking identity cards of some youths who were apparently trying to join the event held against the hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru. However, the video does not show Kanhaiya raising any anti -India slogans."Could you please share proper link?</comment>

<comment> It shows You are desperate to prove Kanhaiya is anti-national and spread the Lies which BJP wants you to spread ???He was part of the the crowd. There is no proof that he was shouting the slogans.Lets say tomorrow some terrorist stands next to you in a crowded market and shouts anti-India slogans, will that make you an anti-national???</comment>

<comment>Chinese would have hanged all those if same happened there</comment>

<comment>Whatever it is...we hope..that the real guilty will be brought to book..all the anti-nationals will be caught....because we Indians...always live on hopes...that this time..it will be done better...better than last 5 years!!People elected Modi..with the hope that.......................2 years on....Lets hope that those hopes get fulfilled..........But still the question remains:1. The ppl who on a daily basis, hoists pakistan & now ISIS flag, speaks for afjal guru and releases Azhar mashood, the separatist from Jail...are partners and friends for Ruling party (BJP) in Kashmir. Why BJP, the nationalist are doing this against countrymen's will?????2. No sedition charge, not even normal police case against them filed by any BJP leader, rather they want them to form govt, and want to support them!!! Why they are not bothered in the universities of Kashmir at all??3. Why HM cannot be a little more prudent on whatever he talks or posts on twitter!!</comment>

<comment>JNU row: Kanhaiya Kumar raised anti-national slogans: BS Bassitimesofindia. indiatimes. com/.../JNU...Kanhaiya-Kumar.../50995002.cms..........he says this.."There is clear evidence that Kanhaiya was raising anti-national slogans and was also giving anti-national speech which comes under 124 (A). He was part of this unlawful activity.".................though i dont like bassi....but he has corrabareted this with video evidence....nothing is above my country.</comment>

<comment>Could you please give the link to the video evidence??? Or is it only with police till now?</comment>

<comment>Watch: New video shows Kanhaiya Kumar part of the crowd raising anti-india slogans..www. dnaindia com/.../report-watch-new-video-shows-kanhaiya-kumar-p...they are claimng that they also have 2 more video clips.</comment>

<comment>The police has not even given it to Rajnath Singh but Blind Bhakths have already character assassinated Kanhaiya Kumar</comment>

<comment>Not a shred of evidence. Please dont spread Lies</comment>

<comment>kuch bhi..</comment>

<comment>Srinivas is boss of bassi</comment>

<comment>BJP was decimated in Bihar and Delhi So, the BJP has fired its brahmastra. It is expanding all its energy on branding rivals as anti-Hindu and discrediting them as supporters of anti-national elements, terrorists and minorities. Well said Sandipan</comment>

<comment>so you are in a habit of enjoying company of anti nationals. no surprises that now you are a bhakt.</comment>

<comment>Which slum do you Live in???</comment>

<comment>No I live in city popularly known as Bijapur with good posh location and had moved in almost all places including slums</comment>

<comment>The Bijapur in pakistan??? Obviously they will have Imran Khan photos</comment>

<comment>Hahahaha then ur not an Indian Bijapur vijaypur</comment>

<comment>Sorry mate. I was just kidding. I have been to Bijapur</comment>

<comment>Not a single Blind Bhakth has been able to give an iota of evidence to prove Kanhaiya Kumar was indulging in acts of Sedition.. I am waiting................ I am waiting............ I am still waiting</comment>

<comment>Between the court has extended the custody by 2 days.KK was the organizer for that event. That is ample proof to be charged under Section 124A. As you can see below the law is very vague and anyone can be easily charged on it.Section 124 A:Whoever, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards. 2[* * *] the Government established by law in 3[India], 4[* * *] shall be punished with 5[imprisonment for life], to which fine may be added, or with imprisonment which may extend to three years, to which fine may be added, or with fine.Explanation 1-The expression "disaffection" includes disloyalty and all feelings of enmity.Explanation 2-Comments expressing disapprobation of the measures of the attempting to excite hatred, contempt or disaffection, do not constitute an offence under this section.Explanation 3-Comments expressing disapprobation of the administrative or other action of the Government without exciting or attempting to excite hatred, contempt or disaffection, do not constitute an offence under this section.</comment>

<comment>Dear if ur friend is innocent wait for court hearing He will be released</comment>

<comment>But you have insulted him. Defamed him. Character Assassinated him. Hanged him.Is this what your Hindutva taught you???</comment>

<comment>Arre Baba, he is in jail, which usually happens when police has evidence</comment>

<comment>he is in judicial custody. has he been declared guilty by a court of law?</comment>

<comment>So Amit Shah is a criminal???</comment>

<comment>Till the time, court does not absolve him, Kanhaiya is a seditionist</comment>

<comment>Which country do you live in??? In India "you are Innocent until proven Guilty". Please do read our Constituton once in a while</comment>

<comment>True. Thats what I am trying to tell you. Inspite of that, the police have arrested him based on certain evidence. You can either request police to give you that evidence or wait for it to be presented in court. No point in asking Modi supporters to provide legal evidence </comment>

<comment>agreed students of JNU  are anti nationals. then their faculty is also anti national who is solidly behind students? if so then who is at fault for appointing anti nationals as faculty of an eminent univ.?</comment>

<comment>Looks like Modi's Pakistan visit is bearing Fruit???</comment>

<comment>Congress</comment>

<comment>but bkats say all of them are communists. so congress did not appoint their own supporters but communists? are you in senses?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>We want anti-nationals to be brought to justice...but where is the justice????1. The ppl who on a daily basis, hoists pakistan & now ISIS flag, speaks for afjal guru and releases Azhar mashood, the separatist from Jail...are partners and friends for Ruling party (BJP) in Kashmir.2. No sedition charge, not even normal police case against them filed by any BJP leader, rather they want them to form govt, and want to support them!!!3. The guys who actually shouted anti-india slogans are still roaming free and police unable to catch them even after these many hours!!!4. HM talks about Saeed's backing based on fake tweet5. The guy, who defeated ABVP few months back in elections and whose slogans are mostly against ABVP (at least till now we could not see any video showing he shouted anti-india slogans). is rotting in jail on sedition charge!!</comment>

<comment>very good point mate</comment>

<comment>Modi is the new Gen Dyer, Kanhaiya Kumar is the new Gandhi. So I am sure Afzal Guru and Haferz Sayed are the new Buddhas. Right?????</comment>

<comment>Correct </comment>

<comment>So gen Dyer killed gandhi</comment>

<comment>Show me any meetings organised in any university to support Gandhi's killer like how Kanhaiya did on hailing Afzal Guru the terrorist who was responsible for death of too many innocent life?</comment>

<comment>Watch: New video shows Kanhaiya Kumar part of the crowd raising anti-india slogans..www. dnaindia com/.../report-watch-new-video-shows-kanhaiya-kumar-p</comment>

<comment>You are not supposed to write that </comment>

<comment>i had already told you..i would change my stance once i get the evidence.</comment>

<comment>Just shows how desperate you gullible guys are the video does not show Kanhaiya raising any anti-India slogans.  At one point, Kanhaiya is also seen standing close to some police officials and checking identity cards of some youths who were apparently trying to join the event held against the hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru. But you all Hanged Kanhaiya Kumar even before this video surfaced???</comment>

<comment>not just video evidence...it seems he did organise anti-national activities and protests even before.....but those incidents never came into prominence..so he was not arrested......so i have reasons to believe that he was truly involved in this incident..ask somen i ws not saying anything against kanhaiyaa till yesterday.</comment>

<comment>bihari ke naam pe kalank hai</comment>

<comment> The truth is, behind every seasonal spurt in the BJP's patriotism and nationalism there is an impending election. The fever is always brought about by the electoral exigency of polarising voters on communal lines. Well said Sandipan Sharma</comment>

<comment> The recent finger-waving at JNU and the triumphal finger-pointing after David Headley's recent deposition are examples of the classic BJP stratagem of giving rivals a bad name and decapitating them with the guillotine of Hinduism and Nationalism to influence an election. Well said Sandipan Sharma</comment>
