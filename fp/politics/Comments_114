<comment>India is secular where people of different caste and religious have stayed together. Trolling India on the issue makes  no sense.</comment>

<comment>It is a natural reaction for sikhs to fight to for justice. From times of Mughals to times of bhagat singh. Fight for justice is what there known for. India should help them receive justice instead calling them radicals as these same radicals helped India in tough times. </comment>

<comment>For Hindus  the sikhs, buddhists and jains are equal members of the larger Indic family drawing from the same roots.</comment>

<comment>If Punjabi separatism is a truly secular movement, then I certainly have some sympathy for them, tens of thousands get massacred in Delhi, not a single conviction.Bihar, UP constitute a third of the seats in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, to this day, political debates never go beyond cows, temples and reservations.Punjabis, as well as ppl of other prosperous states, should certainly push for more autonomy from the center.</comment>

<comment>I hope u understand the difference between 'grieviences' & 'denial of justice'. The so called 'thousands killed by khalistanis' were a creation of the Indian state & print media. Khalistani killings were largely targeted ones according to the 'hit list'- like Lalit Maken, Arjun Das etc. In order to malign & suppress a rights-based movement, the central govt engineered large scale police infiltration into the Sikh ranks who carried out innocent killings under the disguise of Sikh fighters. Such criminals(police agents posing as militants - who harassed & killed innocents to defame the movement) were famous as 'black cats'. This strategy has been admitted by DGP Punjab SS Virk himself. Thousands of innocent Sikh youth were killed in fake encounters & cremated as 'unidentified bodies' under the orders of KPS Gill, Rebeiro & CM Beant Singh. A whole generation of Sikh youth was wiped out in rural Punjab in order to 'appease' the national majority. There are villages in Punjab's border belt which did not a single marriage for over 20 years as all young boys were falsely branded as 'deadly khalistani terrorists' & killed by police officers to increase their 'counter insurgency numbers' in order to get quick promotions & huge cash awards. It was a time in early 90s when police promotions were given on the basis of 'number of Sikhs' killed by them under the 'Cash-for-Bullet Policy' of the Home Ministry. Human Rights activist Jaswant Singh Khalra was murdered in police custody for raising the issue of widespread extra-judicial detentions, human rights violations, fake encounters & mass cremations done by the police under the guise of 'fighting terrorism'. Global outcry was raised by UNHC, International Human Rights Organization(IHRO) & Amnesty International, but these organizations were 'barred' by GoI from entering Punjab to investigate these serious allegations. IHRO still managed to come out with detailed Neutral reports based on eye-witness accounts in Punjab. They were banned in India by the Govt. I sincerely request u to kindly place ur opinion only on the basis of 'neutral reports' instead of blindly believing the Govt. theory. No one wants undue war. No one is 'born' a militant. It is the state repression on innocents which 'creates' militants. It is the general indifferent, impunity & 'silent approval' of national mainstream masses regarding the serious human rights violations by armed forces in conflict areas, which fuels alienation & counter-strikes.Punjab problem was not 'communal' actually. It was made to be one by Govt of India. It was a political problem based on Centre-State relations, but was wrongly branded as a 'communal law & Order Problem'. Demands of Anandpur Sahib Resolution were 'federal' in nature & not 'communal'. In order to gain political mileage out of it, Indira Gandhi Govt. propagated a 'Punjab v/s Centre' problem as a 'Hindu v/s Sikh' problem & gleefully decided to massacre a microscopic minority for getting the massive majority votes elsewhere in the country. Operation Bluestar was the most botched-up army action in India's history. In order to kill 250-300 Sikh fighters inside the Complex, the Indira Gandhi led Indian Govt. had used 3 Regiments(Kumaon, Bihar & Madras), more than 25000 soldiers, Vijanta Battle Tanks, Chemical weapons, battlefield ammunition; in the process attacking 38 other Gurudwaras, killing more than 7000 innocent pilgrims,burning the Sikh Reference Library(which had  housed 300 years of Sikh historic manuscripts & antiques), destroying very holy heritage buildings & 2500 rare handwritten copies of Sri Guru Granth Sahib. This single cruel, insensitive & brutal 10-day operation by Indian Army pushed Punajb into much darker times for the next 10 years. The true story of this operation (carried out under intense media blackout & press censorship to hide the truth) was brought out by the Citizens Investigation team head by Auribindo Ghosh on the basis of eye-witness accounts titled "Operation Bluestar: The untold story" telling as to actually happened inside the Golden Temple Complex during the first week of June 1984. Evidently, this report was banned by the govt.Regarding the Sikh Genocide of Nov 1984 (wrongly called 'riots'), it is a huge disappointment that most of the ppl try to indirectly 'justify' it by citing the Punjab violence. It must be noted that the actual intense armed struggle & demand for Khalistan was initiated in Punjab AFTER the Nov 84 massacre. It wud be so correct to state that had there been no Op. Bluestar, no Nov 1984 massacre, no forced mass-migration of Sikhs from all over the country to Punjab after 1984; there would have been no Khalistani movement. Had there been no fake encounters, there wud have been no political assassinations. Former Chief Justice of India Justice Tarkunde in his 'Report to the Nation:Oppression in Punjab' presented the true situation but was charged with sedition for doing this. 31 years have passed since then. Yet the conviction rate for these cases is 0.1%. Do u think this is enough? Video evidence & eye-witness are available; but justice has been delibrately denied for all these years. The book 'When a Tree Shook Delhi' by Journalist Manoj Mitta & Adv. HS Phoolka gives the clear picture of how judiciary, police & govts, were all hands-in-gloves to push this 'largest massacre in the history of Independent India' under the carpet without any repercussions!</comment>

<comment>My challenge to all Sikh who are in favor of Khalistan why can't they go for real khalistan .. Nankana sahib is in Pakistan What about Maharaja Ranjit singh Ji's capital .. Lahore ??Just take it .. Lets see how ISI give back u a single inch :p</comment>

<comment>Thanks to political parties like congress and AAP .. which can play with lives of so many people and helping ISI to fulfil their dream of India - Punjab as India did to them in 1971..Fkn PorkisI can clearly see by the time of elections rise of violence in Punjab ..</comment>

<comment>What afear-mongering article! Without even understanding the genesis of the presentcrisis in Punjab, the author blatantly accuses the Sikhs of being anti-national, without any evidence. What an excellent example of 'embedded journalism'..! For all my fellow readers, I want to request u all to kindly go through the actual resolutions passed at the Sarbat Khalsa-2015 so that u can know how this author is misleading u into believing that 'the demand for Khalistan' was made there. Leave alone the demand, Khalistan was not even mentioned there. Plz do not fall trap to this false fear-mongering aimed at spreading communal tensions in Punjab. The present crisis in Punjab is a  religio-political & socio-economic in nature & has absolutely no communal nature. It is purely an issue of public outcry against excessive political interference by SAD-BJP govt in the working of Supreme religious institutions. Below are all the 13 resolutions passed at Sarbat Khalsa-2015- verbatim. I fail to understand, what is anti-national in it.."Infused with the fragrance of Gurbani, the mystical body of Sarbat Khalsa met today with unconditional allegiance to the Guru Granth Sahib – an infinite source for wisdom for all. In spirit of consensus-based decision making capturing the political will of the Sikh nation, Sarbat khalsa invokes the leadership of Guru Granth Sahib and Guru Khalsa Panth. And resolves to the following resolutions:First, it absolves the four current Jathedars from their duties – Giani Gurbachan Singh, Giani Mal Singh, Giani Gurmukh Singh, and Giani Iqbal Singh and appoints the following interim Jathedars until Vaisakhi 2016 as follows: Bhai Jagtar Singh Hawara at Sri Akal Takht Sahib; Bhai Amrik Singh Ajnala at Sri Keshgarh Sahib; and Bhai Baljit Singh Daduwal at Sri Dam Dama Sahib.Second, reaffirms Akal Takht Sahib is Guru-gifted, sovereign Sikh institution which must become fully independent again. A draft committee is to be constituted comprising of Sikhs both from the homeland and the Disapora by 30 November 2015 to report on Akal Takht Sahib’s system which includes Sarbat Khalsa and Jathedars’ governance and process. Plan is to be adopted by Vaisakhi 2016 when the next Sarbat Khalsa is to be held.Third, declares Kanwarpal Singh Gill and Kuldip Singh Brar ‘tankhaiya’, chastised for anti-Sikh Genocidal campaigns and summons them at Akal Takht Sahib to present themselves by 30 November 2015.Fourth, finds Parkash Singh Badal, Sukhbir Singh Badal and Avtar Singh Makkar guilty of undermining and misusing the Sikh institutions of Panj Pyare and Akal Takht Sahib; nullifies Parkash Singh Badal’s ‘Faqqar-e-Qaum’ and ‘Panth Rattan’ and Avtar Singh Makkar’s ‘Shiromani Sevak’ awards.Fifth, Sarbat Khalsa creates World Sikh Parliament to represent global Sikhs under the aegis of Akal Takht Sahib. A draft committee is to be constituted comprising of Sikhs both from the homeland and the Diaspora by 30 November 2015 to report on its structure and governance. Plan to be adopted by Vaisakhi 2016.Sixth, calls on Sikhs to safeguard sanctity of Guru Granth Sahib and aptly deliver justice in accordance with the Khalsa traditions to those disrespecting the eternal Guru.Seventh, Sarbat Khalsa recognises the Sikh political prisoners as the Sikh nation’s assets and holds the State responsible for the resultant consequences due to Jathedar Surat Singh’s struggles, and demands all political prisoners of any movement in India such as Sikhs, Naxalites, Kashmiris, Nagas and others to be released unconditionally now. (those who have already completed their terms but are still not being released due to political reasons)Eighth, Sarbat Khalsa revives the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee’s democratic representative system to manage the internal Sikh affairs which have been suspended by the State over the years.Ninth, orders all Sikhs to fully refrain from all internal, divisive, doctrinal debate until the sovereignty of the Akal Takht Sahib is restored.Tenth, recognises the Sikh nation must establish a unifying, independent Sikh calendar.Eleventh, aspires for vatican-like status for Harimandir Sahib complex to ensure every Sikh’s birthright to visit and deliberate at the Akaal Takht Sahib.Twelfth, reaffirms the resolutions adopted by the Sarbat Khalsa held on 26 January 1986.Thirteenth, embraces the disenfranchised fellow human beings to be treated with dignity and respect; appeals to stop the construction of caste-based Gurdwaras and cremation grounds.All Sikhs and Sikh institutions are to implement the aforesaid thirteen resolutions in both letter and spirit.”</comment>

<comment>You are right and so is Amir khan on his statement about growing intolerance in India. This is a sure fact now. </comment>

<comment>they did the same thing with Hindu also. because Hindu, Sikh ,Jain and Buddhist are integral part of these holy land. they always promote foreign religion like Islam and Christianity with no reason. why such discrimination?</comment>

<comment>Seems like bjp, rss paid stooges quick to comment. If hindus can have a country (which mostly sikhs gave shahidi to firstly free from the mugals and then the british) - why can't sikhs? </comment>

<comment>Bhai what about Maratha .. Nanded ?? Have you forgotton ??What about patna sahib ?? What about Jat uprising who screwed Aurangzeb ??What bout 1000's of 1857 revolters ??What about South kingdoms of vijaynagar who screwed Mughal and irani kings ??What about Gorkhas and garwali where no mughal even dared to go ??I know AApstards changing name just putting filth out :) .. have history lessons and come back .. but don't take it from Khujliwal ..</comment>

<comment>Brother why don't you raise your voice of Pakistan side of Khalistan .. Nankana sahib is in Pakistan not in India ..Nanak ji's place is in Pakistan .. Lahore was capital of Ranjit singh Ji..</comment>

<comment>then wait for (to be) taken over by muzzlies ....supposing you are not impostor lol</comment>

<comment>Is that Wat the Guru s' wanted.. .? Break one with another so u can have a 100 percent Sikh nation?racist attitude... World or land even body is not yours..</comment>

<comment>Actually guru gobind ji wanted a independent state for the sikhs free from the clutches of Mughals and state were Sikhism would thrive and grow. Unfortunately india is exactly the opposite. </comment>

<comment>"...free from the clutches of Mughals..." - Sure, and you are still working on his plan by posting your rants on Indian forums. Last I checked, Pakistanis consider themselves to be descendants of Mughals. Do you have the guts to take on ISI & Punjabi Sunnis (in West Punjab), who are still butchering Sikhs, or, is this venom only reserved for Hindus, who are easy targets?</comment>

<comment>India and Pakistan are both artificial countries that were created made by British. I support neither. Both countries have committed many cruel atrocities to its minorities therefore they are both evenly bad. Sikhs have been fighting muslims ever since the beginning of their creation and sikhs often have soundly defeated them even when outnumbered and still continue to do so, just look at the recent wars so don't take about guts. We are often made to fight your fights just look at when everything goes downhill and indian army is in deepsh*t they call the sikh regiment to save there as***. When pakistan overtook the mountain in kargil region (1999 at tiger hill) and were raining down bullets from the top killing blindly, the sikh regiment was sent as last hope and against the odds the sikhs proved themselves yet again.The punjab region has historically belonged to sikhs before there was even a country called india or pakistan. If your people hate sikhs so much why not leave our land and let us live separately? </comment>

<comment>The peaks were almost lost when heavy artillery along with the air-force saved the day. Go over indiandefencereviewDOTcom for numerous articles on it. Stop being delusional. Btw, if India & Pakistan are artificial countries, Sikhism is an artificial religion.</comment>

<comment>Seems like Khalistanis such as yourself are looking to create trouble.If Punjab is mostly in Pakistan, why not ask them for territory? You afraid Muslims will respond by cutting your d!ck off, right? </comment>

<comment>Just read history, sikhs were outnumbered but still managed to win especially against muslims. And you are talking about being afraid. The intolerance is real. Why not just both india and pakistan give the land back to rightful owners and leave sikhs alone to live in peace? </comment>

<comment>Sikhs were outnumbered and look at how many Hindus joined into the ranks of Sikhs and became Sikhs. There is no intrinsic conflict between Hindus and Sikhs, because neither are foreign extra-territorialist invaders.As for why Punjab is mostly under Pakistan, that battle was lost when they out-bred everybody - are you so completely stupid and blind not to see that? Population of Pakistani Punjab is over 100 million, you moron. They outnumber you and me by a ridiculously wide margin. What dream world are you living in? Do you think Sikhs and Hindus even remotely have the numbers to control or drive out so many people? Do you think all these Punjabi Muslims are just going to roll over and play dead so that you can live out your nutty religious fantasy? For God's sakes man, wake up from your hymn-chanting and open your eyes. Those days are lost forever, stop pining for them, whining for them, and nursing bitterness over them. Life has moved on, get a grip on reality, you nut."rightful owners" - oh boy! You might as well be calling yourself rightful owners of the planet. Illiterate religious types are the most delusional.</comment>

<comment>"...pakistan give the land back to rightful owners..." - Why don't you post this on Pakistani forums?</comment>

<comment>1. It's very convenient to call India, a Hindu nation when it suits someone's purpose. However, when Hindus try to make this claim, secularism is thrown in our faces.2. Stop propagating that it's only Sikhs who gave shahidi for the cause, when there were plenty of Hindus involved in the struggle, even during Mughal times.3. If you want an independent nation, try with West Punjab (in Pakistan), especially since the birthplace of Sikhism is in Nankana Saab, and, it's bigger in area. It's very easy to demonize Hindus and it has become fashionable these days. Of course, I'm aware that most of the Sikhs don't really align with your philosophy, however, I dare khalistanis to show some b@lls and try this with Pakistan. Let's see where it leads them. But, they won't do it because they are paid stooges of ISI.</comment>

<comment>Hypocrisy of khalistanis - they want Indian side of Punjab to be converted into khalistan, what about West Punjab in Pakistan, which is the birth place of Sikhism (Nankana Saab) and bigger in area? Do they have the b@lls to take on Punjabi Sunnis across the border, who won't have any qualms while detonating tactical nukes, if push comes to shove. Khalistan is a no go. It's stupidity on part of radicals to think that they can create khalistan and remain independent.</comment>

<comment>Yes Khalistan would be nothing but a small land locked nation where it can have only NRI funded economy ..And i will support khalistan if the real Khalistan is made .. i.e not just Punjab part of India but the bigger one thats in Pakistan .. then we will see</comment>

<comment>Tell your khalistani friends to start with Pakistani side then. Let's see how far they can take it.</comment>

<comment>Khalistanis should be reminded of 1984.</comment>

<comment>You do realize that your comment doesn't make any sense in the context of my comment.</comment>

<comment>There is a statistical fact that during times of indian independence, about 70% or majority arrested and jailed in for acting out were punjabis. Many were killed or prisoner for life in adaman nicobar island jail. Also till date no punjabi has even agreed upon the indian constitution. There were so many promises broken after British left that it has become laughable of who to trust and who not to trust. #growingintoleranceisreal. </comment>

<comment>I'm a Punjabi, mate. Make some coherent comment rather that posting dimwitted comments such as - "...Also till date no punjabi has even agreed upon the indian constitution...". Let's see your source of this premise. What promises are you talking about?</comment>

<comment>Number 1 in the list of the promisis was that "congress would not pass any resolution that did not please the sikhs". That didn't last long, after 1947 sikhs were branded as lawless people. This is just one of the many examples.</comment>

<comment>So if your beef is with Congress, why bring all Hindus into it? What special treatment has been granted to Hindus by Congress?</comment>

<comment>Congress represented India's views at the time and even today it is mostly made up of hindus. Congress has shown many cases in which it presents it's anti-miniority, anti-sikh, anti-muslim intolerant views much like yours. You say we sikhs are being venomous to hindus. Should we say thanks for attacking our holiest shrine plus 95 other gurdwaras and killing a large scale of innocent lives for no reason. Thanks for burning our religious books that were handwritten and can never be found again. Thanks for destroying our properties and throwing tires on us and burning us alive. Thanks for all that, I wonder what we would do without you? Punjab has only helped india whether in wars or being the bread and basket of the country and feeding people. But what has india ever done for us, most notable thing they ever did they that you can remember is 1984 lol. </comment>

<comment>Boo hoo hoo... Aren't there Sikhs in Congress?As for atrocities on Sikhs, their hands are not clean either. Numerous Hindus were killed in 80s in Punjab. Should I be thanking you for it?</comment>

<comment>I actually made a mistake it was not 70% it was actually 80%.</comment>

<comment>Read this, after the British left no punjabi/sikh has signed the indian constitution for a couple of reasons some obvious ones like. 1) india doesn't recognize any other marriage besides hindu one.2) Sikhism is considered a branch of HinduismAlso the sacrifices part you already know it's true . I can't post any sources as the moderator will stop me from posting but feel free to do research. Nehru made many other promisis that were broken</comment>

<comment>1. Punjabi doesn't automatically means Sikh. I'm a Hindu, and, as much a Punjabi as anybody else.2. Here is another statistic for you, most of Sikhs chose India after partition.3. Sikhs, for most part, considered themselves to be a part of Hindu fold up until 1925, when SGPC specifically passed a resolution defining the Sikh identity. This is also a fact, look it up.4. I'm no fan of Nehru either since he is responsible for may other problems, but, that is a debate for another day.</comment>

<comment>If it were up to the punjabi hindus they would of have made punjab another Hindi speaking state. They have almost 0 contributions to punjab and it's culture. You just don't relate to us sorry. Sikhs didn't not get a voice at the time, therefore didn't not sign the indian constitution. The fake promises made punjab and sikhs stay with india. Sikhs would never consider to be hindu that is utter bull as it would go against our teachings. We don't idol worship and we only believe in one god. Please provide proof of point 3. Also don't believe everything RSS and shiv sena teaches you as most is propaganda. </comment>

<comment>Since you have no idea about the philosophy behind idol worshiping, and, other Hindu teachings, I won't go into the details as you are most likely, not open to my point of view anyway. I don't need to win brownie points either by trying to draw parallels. I'm not into appeasement.However, you might want to refer to voiceofdharmaDOTorg/books - 'Who is a Hindu' by Koenraad Elst on Sikh identity (No RSS propaganda). As for 1925 SGPC resolution, please google it.</comment>

<comment>I like how you didn't even try to justify the fact that hindus made nearly 0 contributions for punjab, because you know it's true lol. At least that's one thing we agree on. The 1925 SGPC was needed so the hindus wouldn't gobble up the sikh religion and make it part of Hinduism. It was really sneaky attempt and it got real close but now were in the safe. Good try but try harder next time. Before or after 1925 resolution a sikh is a still a sikh, there shouldn't be a need to pass a resolution for people to understand this. Guru nanak himself said a sikh is not a hindu or muslim. </comment>

<comment>Since your knowledge of history is no better than a madrasa taught Muslim, it's pointless to expect a meaningful debate with you. Go read some real history from several sources. Good luck with that!</comment>

<comment>What is Sikh culture, if not Punjabi culture? Where did Sikhs get this culture from? Was it brought from Mars? I find it puerile to even elaborate on it.Did you even read the book I suggested? There is a separate chapter on 'Are Sikhs Hindus?'. This has been explained in there. I can understand your desperation to hold on to a distinct identity, however, there are flaws in your reasoning.</comment>

<comment>Has India suddenly become tolerant or what? As if earlier it was not. Ever after the Bihar elections I have not heard any `great' artist returning his award. Everybody knows the artists were paid to return their awards to damage the image of BJP government and India.  Why is Aamir trying to rake up the contentious issue now when the country has already discussed and discarded it? India has always been tolerant and will remain so. Despite the propaganda of the pseudo secularists.</comment>

<comment>Current central Govt is using his communal agenda to divide and rule....Every another day BJP ministers uttering nonsense about India is Hindu country......Feku keeps quite on these hatred statements but blabber on foreign land....... Modi Govt is intolerant and making the country intolerant.</comment>

<comment>Who created Bhindranwale? Who is responsible for the killing of thousands of Sikhs in India in 1984 ? Who is behind Sarbat Khalsa? YES. CONGRESS AND ITS PSEUDO SECULARIST LEADERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL</comment>

<comment>This is because Congress has a lousy capitulative ideology, which promotes appeasement. Only desire of Congress is to stay in power, and nothing else. So they don't like to solve problems, they like to leave every problem to grow, because taking any action might interfere with their main desire of sitting around and enjoying their privileges.</comment>

<comment>Considering  the "mob rule" people of Punjab look like angels.</comment>

<comment>Yeah right. Angels who hijacked buses and killed men, women and children by dragging them out of the buses and shooting indiscriminately.</comment>

<comment>Nehru-Gandhi Congress in action.to get power, they will continue to support Paki terror machinery.Nehru- Gandhi created Punjab Khalistani problem.No surprise they are funding  secessionist movements</comment>

<comment>Its Indira Gandhi who first supported bhindrwla and then exectud him .. Its because of Nehru Gandhi dynaty policies .. Yes all the filth and hatred caused by CONgress ..</comment>

<comment>If you cross the The North Korean border illegally, you get 12 years of hard labor in an isolated prison. If you cross the Iranian border illegally, you get detained indefinitely. If you cross the Afghan border illegally, you get shot.If you cross the Saudi Arabian border illegally, you get jailed.. If you cross the Chinese or Paki border illegally, you get kidnapped & may be never heard of again. If you cross the Venezuelan border illegally, you get branded as a spy & your fate sealed. If you cross the Cuban border illegally, you get thrown into a political prison to rot.If you cross the British or US border illegally, you get arrested, prosecuted, sent to prison & be deported after serving your sentence.Now ; If you were to cross the sickular Indian border illegally, these are what you get from the Congress foreign mafia goondas:1. A ration card2. A passport (even more than one, if you so choose )3. A driver's license4. A voter identity card5. Credit cards6. A generous Haj subsidy7. Job, college & school reservation8.

<comment>The ground reality is quite different. So your saying indian border patrol doesn't shoot down people coming over illegally. I assure you they do. Just ask the Bengalis who have been gated away by electric fence that surrounds there whole border. They get shot in the back if they even try to build any sort of defenses on there controlled side and your talking about crossing over illegally. #intolerance</comment>

<comment>Politicians can stoop to any level to serve their means. It was with so such great difficulty and after so much bloodshed that militant violence was controlled in Punjab. Now if people want to disturb that peace it is a very dangerous trend.</comment>

<comment>Yup the politicians thought they could kill innocent punjabis and get away with it. Boy were they wrong, they picked the wrong people to mess with. Justice will be served one way or another. </comment>
