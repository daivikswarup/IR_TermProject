<comment>This is what happens when you choose SENSATION (AAP) over SENSE (Kiran Bedi with 20 years of Administrative Experience). Delhi People Deserve it. Delhi is known to be people full of con, its nice to know that for these con people they got a super con.</comment>

<comment>"We do not do appeasement politics like other parties. We believe in social justice for every section of the society."...KUDO'S TO AAP.</comment>

<comment>Some people can never be satisfied.this what the article proves.  the author is a paid Rahul supporter for sure. otherwise he wont be peddling the rantings of a unsatisfiable and disgruntled elements as truth.AK has already taken steps to declare Urudu as national language and  made urudu as compulsory in every form of government. The number of teachers appointed for  urudu is around 700  with  more to come . This inspite of all the hurdles put by BJP. He has alreay taken steps to add Arabic also as a language to be taught which is conveniently hidden by this author with no mention.  muslim community is and will be happy for all these steps.This author is dreaming of  removing AK and bringing in that dimwit Rahuls rule. that is not  going to happen.</comment>

<comment>AK also is considering of introducing Sharia in Delhi. Black gowns worn by Muslim women would be available at subsidized rate in nearby ration shops from March 2016. Anganwadis too have been instructed to prepare Halal food.Muslim circumcision would be done free in all Delhi hospitals. AK has done so much for Muslims that even Pakistanis would vote for him and Bangladeshis have already started migrating to Delhi.</comment>

<comment>AAP of being no different from the Congress and the BJP. But they have never voted BJP..</comment>

<comment>At last there is an issue against Kejri on which he cannot, even stretching his imagination to its limits, blame Modi and the BJP, but can only kick himself.</comment>

<comment>Good News : Next 4 years will not be as bad as the first.Bad News : It will be worse.</comment>

<comment>is the muslim community monolithic i.e doesn't individual muslims have their own views on who to vote or whom not to... this herd mentality shown by enmasse votes to one party is what hurts them the most and what the so called champions of Muslim cause use and abuse in every elections. Like any other Indian, Muslims of India should break the shackles used by their community leaders and break this mould of fear and victimhood...Only then can they progress... Till such time, they will continue to get abused by these champions of their cause (both parties and community leaders) as these people have vested interests in the status quo... rather than sticking out they should blend in the Indianess and vote as individuals and not as a community.. I hope....</comment>

<comment>I hope people understand their mistake and get a election before 5 years of kejribai...he goes sooner out of Delhi, the fog will go too!</comment>

<comment>The whole Muslim Hindu debate is unnecessary. If you like him, you will find 1000 reasons to like him. If you hate him, you will find many reasons to hate him.</comment>

<comment>now khujli will announce that an emergency is in JNU because he has to come against BJP and abvp and he would go to support Guru ?</comment>

<comment>is it only the aap , join the sickular brigade mate , u will have more now ?</comment>

<comment>one can say from past 60+ years all the so called secular parties (specially Congress and now AAP) used Muslim vote bank only  as a use and throw condoms.. </comment>

<comment>what a disgrace!! as per "approved" vocubulary of RSS, secular should be spelled as sickular. You are hereby terminated from RSS.</comment>

<comment>They should catch hold now Arvind who promised to offer house, job, special university, college, school for Muslims only which will be dream land for Muslims.  But after taking votes, he is enjoying cars and bungalows but threshed them like used tissue paper.  </comment>

<comment>Well you got what you wanted by not thinking of India</comment>

<comment>When we vote, we should vote as citizens of the country and for good governance. But more often than not, Muslims vote for those who think they can take care of them as a religious community. And when the elected person does not fulfill such a need, they feel let down and think they have been used.</comment>

<comment>Why Muslim always expects "something extra" than normal citizen?? After all everyone vote counts.</comment>

<comment>These Bhakts are diabolic, ask any Bhakt of Modi's achievement as PM in approximate 2 years, they will immediately counter, stating that 'be patient, Rome was not built in a day, give him time, after all he has to set right the rot of last 70 years governance. Similarly', why do not Bhakts give the same benefit to AK the anarchist, because they know that AK sticks like a soar thumb up Modi's behind.</comment>

<comment>Have you even read this article? What is the relevancy of your comment to this Article where Muslims themselves are complaining. So all these Muslims are diabolic Bhakts? LOL.</comment>

<comment>OH these Brahmins and Banias from AAP, Communist and Congress are very SHARP. They used every body and then shared the spoils of victory between Bramhins and Banias. Almost all minister in AAP are Brahmin and Bania</comment>

<comment>time to bury caste system, my dear</comment>

<comment>You can't fool everyone everytime.</comment>

<comment>,DILLI KA KAR DIYA BURA HAALEK SAAL KEJRIWAL-AA GAY BHUCHAALSEE ADD 3-4 PAGES IN ALL THE NEWS PAPER AND PRAISING THEIR PAT ONLY? AAP  is spending 526 croresin a year and  , 2 crore daily  to improve the image of AK babu on ad in all the news paper. But will not pay salary to  teaches, govt doctors , and Mcd employeesEK SAAL -DILLI BEHAAL</comment>

<comment>My fellow Muslim nationals /citizens this Kejriwal is a black spot on Inida's forehead. He has no ethics, no respect to the PM post, no respect to anyone. Remember what he / his collegues had said about Shilde sahab (the then Home minister) and Harish Salve, Aruln Jaitley. He is a national shame.</comment>

<comment>this shows AAP only knows how to contest in elections and win. They dont have a clue of what to do after coming to power. God help people who elected AAP.</comment>

<comment>Why do communities ask for something extra in return for votes? You have equal opportunities, you have safety.</comment>

<comment>Don't worry...he will again talk about Muslim Community and atrocities of BJP specially Modi over Muslim Community in 2019 & 2020...when General LS election and Delhi assembly election come. Election is a time when most parties talk about their vote bank and Muslim as community are vote bank only for Congress, AAP, JDU, RJD, SP, TMC, etc. - so called secular political parties.Else Muslim people would have realized that in last 70 years of independence, Muslim's social - economical - political conditions went down from where they were in 1947.How many prominent Muslim leaders you can find in Congress or TMC or SP (except Azam Khan) or AAP? All so called secular political parties are using Muslims as Vote bank through Mullas & Madrassa but majority of Muslim people yet not understand it and believe in Mullahs & madrass.</comment>

<comment>Muslims should not have anything more to ask than what an average Indian need, also they should realise they are no more than Vote Bank to AAP, Congress & SP etc,& it's to BJP who need Hindus Votes on the back of Muslim mongering.</comment>

<comment>You will be surprised to know that Modi supporters like me would actually fight more for nationalistic muslims than anyone else.</comment>

<comment>Even ordinary needs of muslim family are extra-ordinary as they have more kids than normal. so whatever the man earns is not enough. the needs of single muslim family equals needs of 2-3 hindu families. so the suffering of muslims.</comment>

<comment>rightly said the needs of muslims are going up bcse their population grows like cockroaches and they usherup all the resources meant for our farmers tribals other backward classes they successfully blackmailed Khangressie and now they want AAP too yelid</comment>

<comment>oh yes we are from the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen :)</comment>

<comment>first ask them to control their breeding machinery..everything is going to be fine...for u "objective" guys even stats dont matter..only perceptions are truth when ur political masters are not in power</comment>

<comment>nice reply this wont enough we should sterlize their population</comment>

<comment>thats the truth today. some can continue living in self-denial</comment>

<comment>Like this probably..;-)https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CaDrgXiUAAABAg1.jpg</comment>

<comment>hahahaha. this is a common scene. by the sackful ;)</comment>

<comment>Muslim mongering? Explain, Hindus don't vote enmasse like Muslims do. Hindu vote is divided on caste lines.</comment>

<comment>What I say may  not be palatable to Muslims but I humbly feel it is the reality. Congress and ""secular " parties show BJP/RSS as the enemies of muslims and foll muslims that they will not be safe in BJP rule and so they should vote for anti BJP parties. This is never the truth. in five years of NDA rule under Vajpayee Muslims were not made to feel unsafe. In two years of Modi rule Muslims are not made to feel unsafe. An ordinary law abiding Muslim or Hindu or Christian, any one is an Indian citizen. Indian muslims are as patriotic as Hindus and they should join the main stream. Hindus don't follow their priests in political or economic matters. Christians don't follow their priests in political or economic matters. Muslims also should be in the mainstream. Indian laws are good, equal and give justice to all Indians. Believe the party in power. Extend your hand and walk a step, The mainstream is ready to walk two steps towards you.</comment>

<comment>I agree in totality with your comment. But could life be that simple?</comment>

<comment>well said</comment>

<comment>So what if AAP has used Muslims as 'tissue paper' during the last 1 year ? Your Muslims have a proven track record as 'tissue papers' since that's how Congi's and other Sickular Vote-bankers have used them for over 60 years !</comment>

<comment>Every party in country except BJP (because muslims dont vote for them anyways) have used muslims for votes. but state of muslims have not changed a bit since independence. meanwhile all other communities have become rich and leading happy life.</comment>

<comment>AAP is against  Religion,caste politics.</comment>

<comment>hahahaha. good joke</comment>

<comment>The real joke is Ache Din.</comment>

<comment>people are happy only, for your kind information. not coughing in pollution, and suffering from cold weather.</comment>

<comment>hahaha Poor peoples like Mallyas and sahara chiefs who are the biggest Loan Defaulters.</comment>

<comment>boss, pointing out mistakes of others dont make your problems go away. first do something for people of delhi, and then talk. if anybody asks what aap has done, then you people say what bjp has done. will this solve problems of people of delhi?</comment>

<comment>AAP has released one year report card.Read it.</comment>

<comment>ok fine. i will tell delhi people to read the report card, and be happy, and stop complaining</comment>

<comment>Delhi people are happy.They are united.They trusted AAP.Thats why ODD-Even Formula is a hit.</comment>

<comment>But why run it only for 10 days? Anyways how happy they are, will be known in next elections.</comment>

<comment>because its an experiment.</comment>

<comment>experiment with people?</comment>

<comment>kejriwal use delhi people as guinea pig for experiment</comment>

<comment>hahaha. what a title....but for Muslims this is common. they should have got used to all this by now. muslims should wake up now. everybody else are developing. but muslims are voting for regressive parties like congress, aap and crying for 5 years. meanwhile all other states are voting for bjp and developing like anything. when will muslims learn?</comment>

<comment>Now BJP is begging for votes.LOL</comment>

<comment>dude. it doesnt matter for bjp whether people of some states vote for them or not. bjp is in power at center and in majority of states in india. only states which are not ruled by bjp are crying. and muslims are crying the most, as this article suggests</comment>

<comment>But AAP is not one of them.</comment>

<comment>AAP used Muslims voters like Tissue papers? Really? Infact AAP is the only party in India which has refused to take the support of  Muslim cleric Syed Ahmed Bukhari.That too on the last day of campaign.indianexpress com/article/cities/delhi/syed-ahmed-bukhari-appeals-to-muslims-to-support-aap-in-delhi-polls/</comment>

<comment>Come 26th May 2016 and I hope Modi Govt. would be bold enough to come with their 2 Year report card.Hope this time it will be more than 5 Cr. Jan Dhan Account growing into 7 Crore.</comment>

<comment>Azmi is trying to get back in picture.  Pathetic headline trying to create communal hatred. Aap is far better than other parties,  and pointing a view that Muslims as a support base is nonsense. Aap got full support from all communities. People also have brains.</comment>

<comment>Muslims deserve AAP and Congress plus backwardness if they continue to vote them.</comment>

<comment>Tissue Paper can never become a Bond Paper</comment>

<comment>ROFl what a great headline</comment>

<comment>Exact meaning is using them as a cleaning paper to wipe the @$$ of aaptards.....after they excrete</comment>

<comment>LOL.But he gave a certain juvenile Rs.10000 to get mainstreamed in the society. See AK has done something.</comment>

<comment>thats because Modi's centre told state Govts to rehabilitate the Juveniles</comment>

<comment>You didn't get my point,get the right context,it is relevant for this article.About the debate about that Juvenile even being let off, that ship has already sailed.Lets not go there.</comment>

<comment>Kejri is b team of bjp Both against muslims </comment>

<comment>Well, you are like tissue paper</comment>

<comment>Muslims will always be treated like tissue paper till they vote for Congress and its secular mafias. They cannot get away with their herd mentality.You reap what you sow.</comment>

<comment>They are always happyto be used as vote bank, AK will give them just that and no more.</comment>

<comment>Well, Muslims will feel much less "Disillusioned" if they stop voting as "Muslims" and start voting as ordinary Indians..</comment>

<comment>But which party to vote. All r same</comment>

<comment>Modi supporters like me would actually fight more for nationalistic muslims than anyone else.</comment>

<comment>Don't fight for nationalistic Muslim only. Fight for whole country.</comment>

<comment>Not for antinational muslims or Hindus for that matter. It is understood! Why would I fight for those that raise slogans asking for India to be broken up!</comment>

<comment>A day will come when system changes for the better. Wait for that</comment>

<comment>Don't vote at all. It will be better.</comment>
