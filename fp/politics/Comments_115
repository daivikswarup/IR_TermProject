<comment>Its time the Indian army launched its operation to bring back Nankana Sahib back to Indian Punjab Control. Its time it avenged the killing of crores of Sikhs during partition. Lets us not fear the outcome. It is better to die for dharma then to suffer in the hands of the Pakistanis who desecrate our Sikh Holy books and cause un-measurable sadness in the hearts of of the Khalsa.</comment>

<comment>Facts: Shri Guru Granth Sahib ji's Bir was stolen in June.  The police did NOTHING to find the culprits. 4 months later, pages from the Bir are found torn and scattered.  The police does Nothing. A peaceful protest is held asking for culprits to be found.  The police shoot and kill two innocent young men in the protest.  People get irate.  Police finds two random people in a matter of two days to pin his on.  Anyone who believes the story of this corrupt police is stupid.Badal should step aside and let an independent investigation be carried out and the the. Found culprits should be handed over to the people to punish.  Simple.Either that or Khalistan Jindabad...</comment>

<comment>The Khalsa is there for the protection of the entire mankind. Not just Punjab. Sister, The police are inept, Is there any thing new in that. Let us defeat the intention of those behind the desecration. Let us work to bring back Nankana Sahib back to Indian Punjab. Lets us kick out those who killed crores of Khalsa in Lahore. Lets us get back the Indus River back. The Khalsa is gift of Guru Gobind Singh to the entire world. Its message of never bowing to trynny  makes the teaching of the 10 gurus the most democratic and secular.  I dream of the day the world world lives by the teachings of the Guru Nanak to Guru Gobind.  </comment>

<comment>Agreed one hundred percent!!!!!</comment>

<comment>the protest was hardly peaceful   ,it was mob violence  policemen are also humanwhy should police take blame for thismoron sardars  cant see the political  game  behind this</comment>

<comment>India would not exist if not for the Sardars. Stop you insensitive mind from sprouting nonsense. I the follower of Sri Ram found in the Teaching of the 10 gurus the means and ways to implement dharma. In the teachings of the gurus are the path to salvation that is revealed in the bagavatha geetha. An insult to the Sikh Religion is a direct Insult to all Hindus.</comment>

<comment>i have more idea idea about gurus and more respect than most stupid ugly sardars the way gurus bought an order and self respect to the indian masses who were distressed was amazingif you really care for your religion if sikhs really respect their guru get rid ofthe  cunning sgpc jathedars who r abusing their power ,do nothing for religion except looting gurudwaras property and misusing their position</comment>

<comment>You are mixing praise with insults in your comment. Shows you bad intentions clearly</comment>

<comment>stop your insensitive mind from spreading nonsensepraise is for gurus   ,insult ifs for the new gen morons who consider themselves as followers of gurus yet dont know an iota about Sikhism  but  threaten the whole country like a nutcase   ,  living in luxury they have never seen the struggles of gurusthey cant see the snakes that have totally taken over sikh religious bodies and talk     and engineer riots</comment>

<comment>Have you seen the real footage vs what is shown to you by the government owned network channels.  I think not, if u had you would not be making such comments.  The policemen that murdered these two young unarmed kids are the morons and should be killed in the same manner.  </comment>

<comment>here is a tribune headline dated october 14Two killed in Kotkapura as protesters, police exchange fireSome of the protesters started pelting stones, and were asked to disperse by the police.now moron tell me this as peaceful......police ko pathar goli maro   phir kya wo tumhari aari utarange15000  tankhah milti hai saara din naukri karte hain  ,wo bhi to pind ke hi munde hain   ,pakistan se thodi aaye hain ki tum unko paathar maro</comment>

<comment>Sister, The death of two persons is saddening. Let us appeal for calm. I see every Sikh as my brother and sister. India is complete because of the Khalsa and will remain united with the strength of the Khalsa.</comment>

<comment>As it should be seen.  We are Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims second. First we are human.  Those are the teachings of Guru Granth Sahib ji, but when justice is not done it causes a fury inside that is hard to stop. </comment>

<comment>Use your fury for the propogation of the teachings of the guru. I visited the gurudwara  in bangalore  day before yesterday for the first time with my wife and children. Everybody was welcoming. But they know only hindi or pubjabi. We need to spread the teachings of the Guru Granth Sahib ji to non hindi speaking south indians.Yesterday, at dinner I explained why guru gobind singh ji created the khalsa to a friend.  He was mesmarized.Justice is served when we defeat the enimies of humanity by spreading the teachings of the guru.</comment>

<comment>May waheguru bless you and your family and keep you on the right path of humanity and humility. </comment>

<comment>Best time to revitalise khalistani movement . freedom fighters rise up and lead the rebellion . </comment>

<comment>Go home you paki dog. The khalsa have already defeated you pakistanis many times and this time also they will do the same.</comment>

<comment>brilliant comment ....Paki ISI is actually collaborating with Khalistaanis to fan flames of hate and re invent issues to divide Punjab yet again ....there was a sikh who is proud to call himself "pakistani" was paraded in a Paki channel this AM calling Badal a pet dog of NaMo and calling for a joint assault on BJP government ......the congress desh drohis might be working with Pakis to discredit and defame NaMo ....I wouldnt out it past their "dirty tricks department" ....The despicable digVijay singh has already started his campaign on twitter.I feel sorry for Guru Govind singh ji .....anyone seen Govind Nihlani's serial for TV called "Tamas"??? who knows who threw the desecrated pages of Granth Sahib on the streets? could that have been a mischief mongering Muslim? I am just asking questions ...? why shouldnt it be investigated?</comment>

<comment>Where are liberals?</comment>

<comment>Sometimes I think that we need a full fledged war, even a civil war will do. Maybe that will get rid of some idiots and drill some sense in the rest</comment>

<comment>I support you Rahul . Our population is far too much to be sustainable in any case. a reduction of half is needed. A civil war is needed now. And it is not difficult with everyone adding fuel to the fire instead of dousing it with kind words or reconciliation. A war is good perhaps. The remaining, if any, will understand what peace and co-existence is all about.</comment>

<comment>Looks like you share the same brains as your name sake mr. Rahul Gandhi.</comment>

<comment>We are a land of pure unadulterated ch%%^^s.  Someone tears off pages from a holy book and it becomes a major issue. Get a new one instead. I will  pay.</comment>

<comment>for sikhs its not just a book, it is considered a GURU. If somebody was to misbehave with any of the Gurus from your religion, will it be tolerated??</comment>

<comment>Pls give full explanation of why the tearing of the guru granth sahib is a crime against humanity.If every hindu knew that, then they would all become part of the khalsa.</comment>

<comment>more stupidity  ,than let sikhs pay for commandos to guard the holy booksall over the countrycountless gurudwaras have granth sahib  , some enemy of country will always try to create  hatred and such foolishness will aid themwhy dont sikh   work with a cool head and see this is just an attempt to destabilize the state</comment>

<comment>there are countless temples, churches and mosque in india, do we require commandos to guard them?? If there is any desecration of these places, cann't the people be allowed to protest peacefully ??Are the people protesting for police and govt to take action responsible for this destablization or the people involved in the desecration are responsible??The Akali govt has failed awfully in performing its duty, their inaction has brought the situation to this position.</comment>

<comment>u again missed itnowhere people  comeout with swords in hands and start attacking police if anyone be it hindu muslim sikh is so agitated for a book  or religious structure let them spend to guard it   coz  their wlll always be antisocial elements who  will try to create nuisance of such   moronic  followersguard  it man if you are so senstive to it   ,the local grantis / other office beares of sgpc take away all the money  many small gurudwaras have a simple lock   anyone , a drunk, a drug addict , a mentally unstable or a foreign agent   can breakin and do damageand than again sikhs will comeout -burn buses ,shops and threaten everyone , raise anti national slogansthe incident is a clear plot by anti nationals  to start violence nd they have succeeded</comment>

<comment>can you let me know where did sikhs attack police with swords, they have been doing peaceful demonstrations .. without attacking anybody.. its the police that attacked them ..</comment>

<comment>the tribune dated 14 octprotesters attacked police  pelted stones even fired at police</comment>

<comment>So damn true</comment>

<comment>Doomed nation, f00ls think that religion is bigger than life and they keep themselves busy in these useless things. Religion is cancer to the society than a elixir of life.</comment>

<comment>its stupidity attacking police, burning infrastructure over thisthe people who did this  are happy this is what they wanted</comment>

<comment>Daily Mail Bureau | Mangaluru | Oct 18, 2015::  The probe into the murder of a Bajrang Dal activist in Moodbidri town of coastal Karnataka has taken an interesting turn.A local BJP leader has claimed that witnesses in the case are receiving threat calls from international mobile numbers, asking them not to testify in the case.To make matters worse for the police, the prime witness allegedly committed suicide two days ago.The murder has also taken a political angle with the BJP — which is strong in the coastal Karnataka region — alleging that the Congress government was deliberately not according importance to the incident.“It is evident that everyone is trying to hush up the case. The Congress politicians are not showing any interest in ensuring justice to the victim’s family.“Had the police shown concern, they would have arrested the culprits by now.“We are hearing that other witnesses are being threatened over phone from international mobile numbers, including Pakistani phone numbers,” said Dakshina Kannada MP (BJP) Nalin Kumar Kateel.On October 9, Prashanth Poojary (26), an active Bajrang Dal member and a flower vendor, was hacked to death by six unidentified bike-borne miscreants in Mudbidri.He had recently actively taken part in busting illegal slaughter houses and protested against cattle trafficking in the region.On October 15, prime witness Vaman Poojary (68) allegedly committed suicide at his daughter’s home.While the police claimed that he ended his life due to personal reasons, others are linking it to Prashanth’s murder.“Vaman Poojary had clearly seen the faces of the assailants who attacked Prashanth. He could have helped us in identifying the miscreants.“Unfortunately, he is no more and this has been a big blow to the probe. Nevertheless, we are confident of nabbing the killers,” a Dakshina Kannada district police officer said.The cops believe that all the six assailants have fled to Kerala. Prashanth’s cousin Dhyanesh alleged: “We have shared information about the suspects with the police.Read also: Accused in Prashanth Poojary’s murder believed to be nabbed by police“It is already a week, but we are not seeing any progress in the probe,” he said.Kateel also alleged that police already have information about the suspects, but were delaying the probe.“After Prashanth had busted the illegal slaughter house with his friends, a protest demonstration was held by a group in Moodbidri.“Addressing the protesters, their leader Haneef had vowed to take revenge against all those involved in the raid on the slaughter house.“Prashanth was killed at the same spot where the speech was made, but action has not been taken against Haneef so far.“The police should have arrested and questioned him,” the BJP leader said.Courtesy: Daily mail and the links used above.</comment>

<comment>In the 1980s, Pakistan also tried to create trouble by helping foreign-based Khalistanis.</comment>

<comment>Poor Modi, the entire power of so many forces internal and external are bent on derailing his development agenda. This is just one more of such nefarious plans to disturb the peace.</comment>

<comment>But he himself never helped his cause. Modi is one of the most powerful pm in the recent Indian history. Even within his own party he was able to totally sideline most of the guys who could have posed a challenge to his supremacy. Is there any explanation that such a powerful leader is unable to control the 'fringe' elements from his own party? Is there any explanation that a loquacious leader like him chooses not to speak on the issues which are far more relevant than the many things on which he speaks. I am one of those who has always wished this govt to succeed and prove its detractors wrong. Was it so difficult for pm to understand that he needs to at least empathize with the family of Akhlaq? Why could he not make sure that the leaders of his own party condemn the incident in unequivocal terms?</comment>

<comment>Completely agree with you.I am also one of those who always wished this govt to succeed and prove its detractors wrong, for the sake of development of the Country.It appears that a lot of people (including  have fully understood his limitations and are exploiting them to the detriment of the Country. This incident is also apparently part of the chain.</comment>

<comment>Most of the incidents are by creatures in his own party and allies. </comment>

<comment>holy book is desecrated catch the culprits and hang them,don't hang the nation for that,There seems to be concerted effort to discredit modiji as if modiji is doing all these unholy things.</comment>

<comment>BJP/Akali has turned punjab into a drug /failed state...</comment>

<comment>tu aapiya hai na?</comment>

<comment>Its resentment against the State BJP & AKALI Junta........ These parties always mix Religion with Politics. Everyone know How Akal Takhat is being remote controlled by Badal Clan, And BJP a shameless Party, for mere Power  sharing  they will marry  their daughters with the Traitors of this country......... But no more here in Punjab people are suffering due to these voulchers....... But no more they are rising against this treacherous administration.....</comment>

<comment>The incidents which used to get a tiny brief mention in blurred fonts of news tickers zapping by at bottom of the NEWS TV screens , are now intentionally given sec by sec super detailed 24 x 7 coverage with an exhaustive reportage covering emotive elaborate accounts of ‘horror’ by the victims and images to spice up the tragedy to the grisliest level ….. !HARYANA , grow up you stone-head bast@rds .For how long you caste baboons would eat India alive inch by inch. Although that was my general advice , as the present case of ‘Dalit’ murder has more to do it with ‘Personal feud’ than the casteviolence but Media continuing with its policy of blood-lust gorilla war against BJP has bumper-exaggerated this incident too…( P.S My heart goes for little babies deceased and culprits should get the most severe punishment possible under law)Coz , such similar and sometimes even far more gruesome murders during the times of Congress or NON-BJP states , were never even able to reach the DUSTBINS of the News studios but now they would be milked , stretched and skimmed off to the extent until the places which are presently calm also get infected by this ‘Sponsored’ turbulence…BJP NEEDS TO BLOODY BUCK UP , TO COUNTER THIS ‘MILITANCY’ BY MEDIA AGAINST THEM… ! and KHATTAR seems to be a very naïve and NON-political CM ever… even I can handle media better than him....</comment>

<comment>So very right</comment>

<comment>Amrinder is wrong to blame Badal. In such a situation any body heading the Govt would have fared badly. Why he is not able to understand the Sikh physique that for them desecration of Guru Granth Sahib is intolerable. Had he understood that he would not be with the Congress today. Congress had been always playing with Sikh Sentiments right from Indira's time till date. Till date no one Cong leader has been convicted for Sikh carnage in Delhi. What happened in Golden Temple in 1984 Sikhs can not forget. Army had killed children on a Gurburabh. Congress should not shed tears. Yes let us not forget AAP is Congress's first cousin.</comment>

<comment>Police did right but why so cruel with people.</comment>

<comment>blame foreign hands, when the problem is inside, in effectual police and people who get riled up at silliest of things.</comment>

<comment>If we do not solve the crime, then foreign hand n legs.</comment>

<comment>when u cant have proper investigation ...blame foriegn hand and turn the debate to differeny direction....ridiculous...have proper investigation and punish the criminals...</comment>

<comment>This is today's India criminals get rewarded. </comment>

<comment>One thing about rural Punjabis is that it's easy to instigate them. Most of them just don't think before going about things... Though many of my Punjabi friends are aware of the evil plans of kejriwal.. Literacy plays it's part. </comment>

<comment>Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh InsanA very interesting name!</comment>

<comment>Hey, which exact pages were torn off? Wouldnt it be ironic if those pages dealt with peace and non-violence? Yeah, that would be hilarious.</comment>

<comment>AAP especially Jarnail Singh of AAP who have   donor links in Australia are instigating the sikh community for political gains...Acts of fools who break the law are to be blamed not the government which is fighting this dirty force within. Ir-responsible reporting by media also adds fuel to these incidents. Shame!!</comment>

<comment>Just see hard patel in gujarat and this guy jarnail  in punjab... Kejriwal bastrd sem to have grand plans to rule the country by dividing it..I wonder why Indians don't understand politics,.... </comment>
