<comment>Manjhi will win......</comment>

<comment>Who is this idiot writer.. Does he seriously believe manjhi will win because of minority vote... Jaggi ought to sack such nincompoops</comment>

<comment>Let this be a contest between " Honest Vs Corrupt "Let all corrupt go to jail with out bail.</comment>

<comment>this is not nitish kumar but his incompetence for which he was removed</comment>

<comment>The people should defeat Manjhi if he has not performed in past. He is not capable of bringing any progress in Bihar. So people must defeat non-performing & corrupt leader.</comment>

<comment>They should defeat the nexalite supporter chaudhary. People of Immamganj are living in fear due to this DON. Manjhi should be welcome. He is victim of torture of OBC on Dalits</comment>

<comment>From the on ground realities, it looks that Manjhi is loosing with great margin of votes</comment>

<comment>Bjp should not have allotted more than 12 seats to manjhi.</comment>

<comment>Very Very true</comment>

<comment>Minority electorates in Bihar must be careful while exercising their franchise and they must ensure that their votes don't go waste.</comment>
