<comment>Some of my hindu  friends working in  southern illiterate  of  kerala state inform me that anti-hindumedia and TV channels like Times Now, Cnn-ibn, ndtv, aaj tak, india today who make such a big issue of an isolated crime did not report so far reports coming from that state that thouands and thousands of poor sc,st, backward and tribal hindus are force-starved for past 50 years and no TV channel or newspaper hasreported this grim news since the media and TV channels are under control of jehhadi and vaaaticcan masters who are good only in maligning and trageting and blackening and torturing hindus only.So if hindus become more fanattic due to non-stop torturing by anti-hindu demons and demonesses and prestttitues, and take violence in their hands as a last resort, why blame them only for all theterrror-related violence problems? though it is muzzzlims and christains whoare doing hate &terro rpeeacching from their mozzques and madraaasas andchurches 24 hours a day against others or kafeeers or infideeels for the past 2000 years</comment>

<comment>Happen to read the article and many of the comments below as well. Although these times its very difficult to convince or impress anybody online over any sensible issue or events, specially amidst a hostile and prejudiced environment, I shall still take the risk of submitting my point of view.To my whatever exhaustive understanding till now, niether Owaisi Brothers, nor Togadia, nor Modi, nor Nityananda might have had ever happen to kill a human being with their own hands, inspite of being labeled as hugely communal and divisive icons of society.And im also simultaneously sure, that none of the people who are spewing so much hatred and venom against respective communities on this forum, might also have had never ever killed any human being in their life times. Bcoz, those killers will always be from the poor, barely educated, instantly indoctrinated and are from some sort of criminal backgrounds.However, if somebody happen to kill a single family member of others, then every chance is that we all may jump in revenge and soak our clean hands in blood bath. This vicious cycle will never end. Hence my request to every educated and sane person is to talk as much as sense and knowledge as possible, and dont restrict your vision to bloody aftermath of India, pak, partition history alone, BUT STILL KEEP SCRUTINIZING OUR OLD COLONIAL MASTERS WHO HASNT NOT YET GIVEN US FULL REAL FREEDOMS BY ENSLAVING US INTO A DIFFERENT TYPE OF SYSTEM, namely MONETARY SYSTEM.THAT SINGLE KNOWLEDGE WILL CHANGE YOUR PERCEPTION OF WORLD COMPLETE 180 DEGREES.</comment>

<comment>But The editor is trying to convince Owasi by this article & read the last line, how he trying to convince hard by dragging UP!!! shame..... In Delhi election, some prominent News editors has convienced him not to contest Delhi!! Now not to contest Bihar ..... why?? Just do reporting guys, Don't do nasty politics</comment>

<comment>nice reply to the sickular party...</comment>

<comment>Can u plz forward any news link or refer any authentic documents as proof to your seemingly exaggerated story</comment>

<comment>Owaisi needs to back off so that Ajaz Ashraf's dearest "Congress" can win Bihar otherwise Owaisi is a "secular" muslim who is being wrongly accused and portrayed by the media.</comment>

<comment>A party which is contesting 41 out of 243 seats will win Bihar. There should be a ban on moronic comments.</comment>

<comment>Sorry Boss the dear grand old party is contesting within a "grand" alliance of "sickulars". Owaisi too has been a darling of Congress in hyderabad</comment>

<comment>That is right but the question still remains how the unlikely victory of the so called 'grand alliance' can be called a victory of Congress which is minor partner and is not going to win any seats.</comment>

<comment>You know Congress had been in power in Delhi since last 15 years yet it was BJP who lost Delhi in spite of Congress scoring a duck.</comment>

<comment>You are wrong here. Since Congress had been ruling Delhi for 15 years, if any party lost in Delhi it was Congress. BJP was not in power in Delhi. What you can say is that between tussle for power in Delhi</comment>

<comment>Not my saying but it is what is propagated by the media</comment>

<comment>Some of my friends working in gulf countries inform me that about 3 years ago a muzzzlim policeman of a gulf country, now sure whether it was suadi aabia, kuwait or qatar, shot dead theree indian hinduworkers by putting a gon on their head, and their crime was they were drinking water from a bottle at noon hwen the heat was unberable in the fasting month of Ramadan. Since sooonia&ejjhadis&vaaaticcan agents were ruling hindustan, they asked the embassy offocials not to report that news to indian media and TV channels and the embassy personnel after getting heavy bribe form the gulf government reported the news to the familes of the dead hindus from anadhra pradesh that they were keeeled in traffic accident and did not reportas a terror crime and silenlty destroed all evidence of state jehhadi terrror too.Hope Modi government orders the embassies in gulf states to reveal the whole truths about the above ghastly murders of poor hindu workers and must also arrange hefty compensation from the gulf government to the families of the three hindu workers keeeled by the jehhadi beast keeler too. In muzzzlim countries even now and even in muzzlim majority areas of hindustan, those found eating or drinking in public even by non-muzzzlims are badly attacked by muzzzlim goons and even by police personnel in states like kerala , kashmirr and UP since the muzzzzlims and jehhadis are controlling the major ministries in those states.</comment>

<comment>Aijaz Ashraf, instead of teaching Owaisi lessons to damage bjp, please give him lessons of secularism to him and his bro, who on daily basis give Inflammatory speeches.Fighting elections is better than giving Inflammatory speeches and cursing government that it is not looking to their matters.</comment>

<comment>I suggest AAP to merge with Owaisi's party as there is hardly any difference between these parties</comment>

<comment>Lo ab ajaz miyan ke g@@nd mein bhi mirchi lag gayi, burnol lagalo bhaiya</comment>

<comment>he is just contesting from 6 seats.. how can that help BJP or other party in the contest of 200+ seats....</comment>

<comment>Thank God! The people who vote doesn't have to read to your biased and bigoted views. Keep wasting your sponsored outdated thinking. Owaisi is at least better then you guys who rather than doing any good in real life eats their bread begging from congress and AAP.</comment>

<comment>THESE RAZAKRIS SHOULD BE SHUNTED OUT OF COUNTRY FOR KILLING HUNDREDS OF HINDUS DURING RAZAKAR MOMENT IN HYDERABAD DURING 1950s. Salahuddin Owisi who happend to be a trusted lt. of Qasim who fled india to Pakistin handing over charge to Owisi died a dogs death in Pakistan. Let them follow him.</comment>

<comment>Owaisi is intelligent,  has good control over languages, eloquent speaker, sophisticated & good debater.  We all agree to this description.However, we are also aware of how communal this man (along with his younger brother) can be.   He heads a party which originated from Razakars group in  Hyderabad.   He probably wants a country where Muslims will rule the Kaffirs.This man might be very capable,   but his intentions are pretty evil for this country. Intentions do matter for most if us.</comment>

<comment>owaisi's outlook of india is more nationalist and rationalist than leaders of other mainstream party.his ideas are clear-cut and loud than that of other old school leaders.</comment>

<comment>Your photo does full justice to you. Congrats!</comment>

<comment>yes...you like him don't you,...</comment>

<comment>I don't know why people hate Owaisi so much. Agreed he bats primarily for Muslim and Dalit rights and he is vocal about his faith. And agreed that his brother is an idiot.But I ended up stumbling on some of his videos where he is seen debating with Pakistani counterparts along with Mani Shankar Aiyer. It is humbling to see how he politely tears into the Pakistani accusations and defends India and it's secular fabric. He is also one of the most active parliamentarians we have. He is active in most debates, has the most questions about different policies. He is essentially, and possibly unfortunately for the rest, what we would want our parliamentarians to be like.I think Owaisi is better than most politicians that we have currently.</comment>

<comment>Can you also put the same photo as the chap above you? That way one will not need to Congratulate both of you.</comment>

<comment>If only everyone could discuss things rationally, without resorting to childish antics and behaviour, I think our political discourse could get much cleaner.</comment>

<comment>Do let us know where in this World is this discourse clean and rational? Stop seeing stars in the daytime, they will be too many to count.</comment>

<comment>The point was: You can make an effort with your own self.But yeah, if you want to blindly follow the hatred and cynicism, because that seems to be the norm, please go ahead.</comment>

<comment>I had also said earlier that , take away the 'communal' streak in him and he is a better parliamentarian than most of the jokers who are sitting in it !</comment>

<comment>well said..atleast he speaks in the parliament rather than just sitting their...</comment>

<comment>he is also the Sansad Ratan Award winner for 15th Lok Sabha</comment>

<comment>Looks like owaisi was offered a "package"  by BJP which he couldn't resist. </comment>

<comment>:)</comment>

<comment>LOl, Ajaz bhai, why dont you just get on your knees and give Owaisi and his neatly trimmed, but mystique having, pubic hair a blowjob? This entire article is sh*te because it begins with the fantasy premise that Owaisi is an intelligent, secular leader, when in reality he's just another communal pig.</comment>

<comment>so for you RSS and BJP are very good, secular? right?</comment>

<comment>Some times one wonders where is the country and the politicians going. This Owaisi clan is hell bent on bringing anarchy in the country with their very abusive utterances on public platforms. But they will be protected and taken care by the same law which would put any other person in jail for saying in half of what these crazy brothers say. Why these double standards. After their speech two temples were vandalized in Bihar, everyone just chose to ignore it. What type of system is this? </comment>

<comment>Two Temples where ??</comment>

<comment>in adobe photoshop!! :D</comment>

<comment>Bhakts have also started Hawabazi</comment>

<comment>Owaisi is better than all opposition leaders, forget about politics he is another Icon of India weather good or bad public media figure</comment>

<comment>Rofl...</comment>

<comment>why he should exit owaisi has every right to make his party contest in Bihar</comment>

<comment>He wants maha jhutha bandhan to win.</comment>

<comment>MIM and BJP bhai bhai chutiyaaaaaaaaaaaalog abi tak nahi jaggayyyye</comment>

<comment>LIES</comment>

<comment>In politics no enemies</comment>

<comment>JDU-RJD has propped up Shri ASHRAF TO convince Mr Owaisi to back off.</comment>

<comment>It was a big mistake for Kejriwal to campaign for JDU-RJD. They are going to loose whether AK will campaign for them or not. But AK dented his clean image by campaigning for Lalu.</comment>

<comment>kejriwal clean? even after tomar, etc dear dear where is his lokpal? what about the onion scam? who got ad contract? sisiodia?</comment>

<comment>Yes. Kejriwalji was very stupid and opportunist.  We need a strong leader like Somnath Bharti to represent us.</comment>

<comment>Like your screen name..</comment>

<comment>Even my dog knows about Lalu, How come a grad from IIT mistook it?</comment>

<comment>Even Somnathji's dog knows about Lalu.  We should replace Kejriwal with Somnath Bharti ji as a leader of AAP. Somnathji is also from IIT. He is a strong leader and can deliver quick justice</comment>

<comment>Clean image????? he shamelessly keeps poking at PM.. he says he is from IIT.. does he not have the basic common sense that if he keeps criticizing the center the center will not care for him or the state he represents and the people of that state will suffer? he is playing dirty politics which even the experienced politicians does not do.. all he wants is the PM seat by 2019.. shame on such a loser.</comment>

<comment>"RJD supremo Lalu Prasad's elder son Tej Pratap Yadav is 25 and younger son Tejaswi Yadav is 26, if the affidavits filed by them with their nomination papers for Mahua and Raghopur assembly seats, respectively, in Vaishali district are to be believed!" - TOIThis family of illiterate nincompoops making a joke out of indian politics</comment>

<comment>Muslim girls education in stead of Haj subsidy? If he is serious about it, he should get a Nobel like Malala. Muslim women should vote for this guy, he makes sense.</comment>

<comment>It's only drama to show he is progressive, nothing else.This guy is worse of the opportunistic breed of politicians!!</comment>

<comment>He is right in this regard, Huj subsidy is the biggest load of bullcrap...we need to use it for smthng more substantial.</comment>

<comment>owaisi sahib is our leader he always raise his voice in favour of our community</comment>

<comment>When would you say country first?</comment>

<comment>which is your community? The one that treats the dead amongst you as dirt and bulldozes them into heaps like they did at Mecca?</comment>

<comment>what is indian muslim . we are muslim first being an indian is not an important issue hindus are our slave we ruled them for 1000 years . i love hindu womens they are very good kisser</comment>

<comment>You are the epitome of what an Indian Muslim is not.</comment>

<comment>Shanu Khan, you are living in delusions.Your blood, language and culture is the same as that of Hindus of India. Your religion came from outside through barbaric conquerors like Mohammed Bin Qasim and Babur, they were not your ancestors but they were your conquerors as much as they conquered the Hindus.It is people from your community who either converted out of choice or lack of it and some of you started identifying yourself with the rulers to get rid of the humiliation of being ruled. If you don't believe me, see the way the Arabs treat the Muslims of the subcontinent who go to places like Saudi to do their menial jobs, not much has changed over the years. You are ashamed of your own association while the people whom you want to associate yourself with are ashamed of you.You are Muslim first because you believe in the hallucination called Ummah, ever wondered how the Arabs despite having the same faith, language and food are divided among 22 countries rather than one country leave alone the rest of the Muslim world.If Muslims first was indeed true than Saudis would not be fighting along side Israel against the Iranians rather they along with the Egyptians and Jordanians would have taken a stand against the might of Israel.You need to get over yourself and stop thinking your ancestors were dates eating camel riding Arabs.</comment>

<comment>Lol....are you serious man.... you are the reason why fringe outfits exist in India....anyway take care...... you are obviously not in control of your senses.....may be a trip to Syria or even Pakistan will make you understand how lucky you are to be born in a country like India</comment>

<comment>You need to be educated and treated medically.</comment>

<comment>If being Indian is not important why do you live here ? There are a lot of Islamic countries out there.</comment>

<comment>Get your head examined; it may not belong to a Homo sapien.</comment>

<comment>Owaisi, Azam Khan, Adityanath, Prachi, Niranjan Jyoti, Sakshi Maharaj, Sangeet Som, Mahesh Sharma, Togadia, Ashok Singhal, Hurriyat are ALL of the same ilk: hate-mongers, fear-peddlers, aggressive community identity-cobblers and should be discarded by all peace-loving democratic people of India.</comment>

<comment>I would not mind that sir but would the Muslims reciprocate, they would still be the followers of perfect faith who have a divine right to mock other faiths, I have a problem being mocked on my own land.</comment>

<comment>Typical leftist thinking. Just because of BJP/RSS/VHP you Hindus are still breathing. Go and thank them. Don't be an ingrate.</comment>

<comment>Just because majority of Hindus are peace loving and not communal, we have NOT yet degenerated into being Iraq or Syria or Pakistan. In spite of people like you who are refined Hindu born Talibani attitude hotheads. Global Indian will go for a toss with intolerant people like you.</comment>

<comment>India can't be Syria or Pakistan because Hindus are proven cowards or the new word is sickular, ie., always licking other's arses to prove how good they are. Don't worry about other things.</comment>

<comment>Just a line: your language and your anonymity show your decadent culture, and sick mind, which deserve no further attention. Period.</comment>

<comment>Get down from your ivory tower mister. Look around you, open your eyes and see whats happening. The Hindu polarisation or consolidation that you see is not to mimic Muslim polarisation but to counter it. When Muslims drive out Kashmiri Pandits from their homeland, asking to leave their daughters behind, whom do you turn to- the army, govt. or fake liberals? No my dear, you turn to your community and organise yourself for the protection of your interests. The same liberals who wanted us to exercise restraint before drawing Mohd. and wished that charlie Hebdo should have been more careful are vociferous in their opposition of beef ban. What does it say about their objectivity? Muslims demanding Sharia in UK, a Christian country ? why? Muslims preying over minority community in every Muslim majority country ? Why ? Muslims identifying themselves with Rohingyas  of Burma and defiling the memorial to the "Indian" soldier, who did nothing wrong. Is it tolerable?  And then they demand equal rights where they are in a minority.</comment>

<comment>Please note that no one in their right minds wanted Charlie Hebdo  to excercise restraint... the first and foremost right of a modern free thinking society is the freedom of speech and expression....Also why are you comparing India with Muslim majority countries...  is it our aim to reach their level... or do we want to reach the level that the developed world has reached ....</comment>

<comment>Stupid to compare India with trouble torn Muslim nations. Stupid to even think that Hindus will do well by radicalizing themselves. They will beat a few dozen Muslims and kill some, and India will get a beating across the world. Modi faced a hostile world for ten years after Gujarat riots. Your ideas as an condemnable and stupid as are the ideas of ISIS or Talibans. Rational thoughts will finally prevail. You guys will be in the footnotes of history as an Osama Bin Laden is.</comment>

<comment>UK is a trouble torn Muslim nation? Why Sharia neighbourhoods in Birmingham. Why are so many Muslims in India lining up to join ISIS? Why should a techie in India sit and tweet glorifying  ISIS and its gruesome beheadings.How many Kashmiri pandits became terorrists after being driven out of their homes? Hinduism is inherently pacifist. The plurality of Hinduism is under threat by the same savages who took advantage of it.  I am not in favour of killing or beating up Muslims but I am definitely in favour of asking people to stop acting as apologists for Muslim religious fundamentalism.</comment>

<comment>Let the law punish all offenders. Do not use anti socials among Muslims to justify an inhuman or anti social activity of some lumpen guys born Hindus. Dadri murder is a lumpen act. NOT of Hinduism which is a great way of life. This approach you have is what is used by some Maulavis and fundamentalists to infuriate Muslim youths using Dadri type incidents.</comment>

<comment>hurriyat are the voice of kashmiri . kashmir is not part of india it is occupied nationpundits not live in kashmir . indian flag is not flying in kashmir</comment>

<comment>Hurriyat has never been voted to power, its call of boycott of votes supported only once by Kashmiris. So your ideas are baseless just as Prachi or Shakshi Maharaj are baseless rabble rousers.</comment>

<comment>"I want justice for all and appeasement for none" .. said  by Yogi Aidityanath..</comment>

<comment>What is says and does are TOTALLY different. Biggest rabble rouser on the love jihad issue, and UP voted against BJP during last bypolls when Adityanath was given charge of campaign.</comment>

<comment>get lost sicular commee to Bangladesh!</comment>

<comment>r u aware of tragic tale of  Tuktuki mandal - a minor 14 year old hindu girl, who was kidnapped, raped, n converted  by islamic goons..  about this case, u can see the victim interview n news x report in youtube.. or you can read the whole issue in dailypioneer.. since the culprits were Muslim n it happened in a secular state of WB  So no media houses n aadarsh liberals broke there bangles n cried over it...</comment>

<comment>That story is done by my former student now working for News X, Saurav Sanyal. Very much aware. Media took up the issue as well. There are such issues, and there are issues of voluntary conversion like AR Rahman and not converted marriages like that of Kareena Kapoor. Not just high profiles. Naming them because you know them. I know at least six ordinary Hindu-Muslim couples living happily without conversion. This is a personal decision. Tuktuki case is a legal case. BOTH not the same. And to do politics on the misfortunes of cases like that of Tuktuki is what is wrong. I do not want my countrymen to do politics of Pakistan.</comment>

<comment>fed up with you kind of sickulars, people are more broad hearted than you but one religion only wants removel of hindu names in the above list, but they always loves one community names. dont comment with half knowledge and dont give buildup like secular. most of the people who hates one community are more broad hearted than you but after find the truth (their aim is only to expand their religion) they started hating</comment>

<comment>Just the same language of yours spoken by Maulanas and political sadhus alike. You do not astonish. Because your type of guys will always keep dividing society, but still I have trust in the country, people, and its heritage.</comment>

<comment>The picture of partition of India in 1947 has been incomplete as it left 180 million Muslims still in India. To make the picture complete there should be further partition. All the Muslims in India should be pushed into three states neighboring to Pakistan (Gujarat, Rajhasthan & Punjab) and handover these Muslims to Pakistan. This will cleanse India into a purely Hindu country.</comment>

<comment>Wishful thinking. Treachery to the Muslims WHO WILLINGLY stayed in India believing in the leadership's commitment of secularism and democracy. Your wishes will never be fulfilled.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Yes, this is the problem. Many misguided Hindus will again convert to Islam. We shall bring new legislation to ban conversion.</comment>

<comment>Pradeep will then ask for one more partition..simple.</comment>

<comment>It is not a question of giving land. The question is getting rid of Muslims by paying a cost for it. Won't it be worthwhile? Let us take seriously.</comment>

<comment>You must be an AAP volunteer. No other can have so much less IQ.</comment>

<comment>Dadri incident: 20 lakhs for Muslim's death, but Hindu doesn't even get 20000-  says Sakshi Maharaj,  what wrong did he said...</comment>

<comment>When did it happen? What compensation was given to Sikhs murdered by Hindu mobs? Or Muslims murdered in Gujarat? And even Hindus murdered in Gujarat? Sakshi is trying to rabble rouse with UP elections ahead.</comment>

<comment>On Owaisi and Azam and Hurriyat  - you are correct. The rest is your perception. Please spell out the "hate" emanating from them to substantiate your charge.</comment>

<comment>what the writer is doing is readying ground of excuse for the poll debacle that 'maha-alag-alag-bandhan' is going to suffer in coming bihar elections.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Very rightly said, We should push Muslims towards Pakistan and give some provinces adjacent to Pakistan borderlike Rajhastan, Punjab and Gujarat  and ask Pakistan to take care of all Muslims, it will be a good riddance. India will become pure Hindu state.</comment>

<comment>No thanks. I like Muslims. You can go somewhere else if you don't like them. I am a Hindu who voted BJP by the way.</comment>

<comment>I also love Hindu women they are hot and very good kisser . our Pakistanis brothers enjoyed their best moment of life in 1971 in bangladesh</comment>

<comment>What wrong with you? We have to solve minority problem.</comment>

<comment>What minority problem? They are Indians just like anyone else. As much right to be here. Guaranteed in perpetuity by the constitution. If you hurt them, you'll find a lot of Hindus looking to hunt you down too. I will be among them. India is for all Indians.</comment>

<comment>Buddy - I'm with you as long as they state that they are Indians first and Muslims or Christians or any other next....</comment>

<comment>It is very clear minority problem. India was a Hindu country and must remain as Hindu country. These outsiders have come and have polluted our society. Our goal should be to purify it. Let’s not get into this rigmarole of modern society, secularism and enlightenment.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, write this down and run for election. Let's see precisely how much support you get.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You are misguided Hindu. Then what to do? After allthese Muslims are a problem for us we must find a solution for it else we willlose our identity. I invite suggestions to solve this problem</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>This is good solution but we have to think about Hindus in those province. I think we shouldaccept them in our country to fill the place of Muslims and this should happen in an organized way. Hindus and Sikhs should come back to us & Muslims from India should migrate to Pakistan with mutual arrangement.</comment>

<comment>Mr. pradeep you are no different then people like qwasi or sakshi maharaj......until people like your or with the mentality of your kind exists in our society, it will never get "purified"....Let me tell you I am a Muslim and I love my country India and I will vote for one who promises development of the nation and I did so by voting BJP...First 'purify' your mind then think how to purify the society....</comment>

<comment>The Dalit and OBC Hindu vote will be hard for him to attract, because the BJP has already gone deep into low-caste. The entire high-caste has sort of been rooted out from core leadership. However, he could actually appeal to urban Hindus, I feel. Every time I listen to him, he seems really sensible and educated to me. I actually like him. BTW I have voted for Modi. But I could easily consider voting for Owaisi myself if he focuses on development more. I like him more than Congress.Also, if Mayawati could attract the entire Hindu high-caste vote in the last to last elections, he could potentially do it too even in rural areas. It is not unthinkable. It all depends on how he approaches it. Indians in general are losing the propensity to vote based on identity. He could benefit.</comment>

<comment>He sounds reasonable only because he cannot spout venom openly on national television. Moreover, he doesn't need to woo muslims by the standard rigamarole of donning a skull cap, visiting madrassas and organising Iftars because Muslims already identify him as a religious person. So he can speak about real issues but I doubt he can choose wisely when it comes to choosing between interests of India and the muslim community. If he is so modern, why doesn't he ask for a uniform civil code or dismissal of Muslims laws exploitative of women?</comment>

<comment>Mayawati was able to win coz of her unique formula of Dalits+Muslims+Brahmins....all minorities in their way. I dont see Owaisi giving tickets to hindus, it just doesnt depend on the high level leadership.</comment>

<comment>As long as politics is based on caste and religion, no matter who comes to power it will be sh!t.</comment>

<comment>True, but eventually the leadership reflects the people. And the statistics are that literacy is rising dramatically in India. It is 75%. In Bihar it is already 65%. On top of that media has become just insanely ferocious. It is impossible to say two different things in two different places. And TV is just adept at peeling off masks systematically. We all remember what Arnab did to Rahul Gandhi. There is no escape. If politicians have to win, they have to play to this new India. And it demands services, literacy, development, security. Politicians will have to fall in line. They have no choice. Modi and Owaisi are both symptomatic of this. Nitish is too. Ultimately everyone is being forced to talk the new language of India.</comment>

<comment>Remember the bangalore techie who was apprehended for tweeting about ISIS. Literacy doesn't quell fundamentalism. It just gives you more potent arguments to justify it.</comment>

<comment>I agree with you but two things, don't equate definition literacy to Indian figures of literacy, that is illusion or I can say misinterpretation. secondly we can't rely on one person to change a nation. The real literacy will create many good leaders and that time we will see some change.</comment>

<comment>Well, it's not like the literacy tracking methods have changed. It is headed upwards for sure. From my own experience, it definitely feels like most people know how to read and write.</comment>

<comment>He seems a better option than RJD, Congress, JDU, Maya and Mamta</comment>

<comment>I agree.</comment>

<comment>Satya meva jayate ... truth prevails...</comment>

<comment>Not only bihar polls but all -- as 0waisis don't understand democracy at all!</comment>

<comment>One thing is clear- Congress and other sickulars are smart. They blamed the Hindu Mahasabha and Jinnah for India's partition and enjoyed uninterrupted power for decades; now they are blaming RSS and Owasis .The only difference from then to now is the presence of MODI.</comment>

<comment>hahah...look pseudosickulars journals ki jal gayi hai,,,</comment>

<comment>Owaisi  and 'modern'? Aijaz is joker. Owaisi is most backword muslim in thinking and hating others ,especially Hindu,,also ''expert'' in twisting and takind u-turns about his own oral purge.</comment>

<comment>No sir. The Owaisis are in the business of politics since you or I were born. Obviously Owaisis will start to think big, and plan to go national. They know pretty well how to grab attention of minorities.</comment>

<comment>Poor Firstpost, they are already worried that BJP may win, so suggesting MIM to withdraw</comment>

<comment>Owaisi is an intelligent and rational person. But postures he has adopted to win votes are self-defeating. He is unwillingly(?) helping communal forces gain legitimacy.</comment>

<comment>Owaisi is a sh!t head and he has received huge loads of money from BJP for his misadventure in Bihar... In any case Owaisi is an epitome of a radical politician who uses Religion as a tool to misguide people..</comment>

<comment>aijaz cribbbing looll.. lool</comment>

<comment>Lol, basically the author is saying BJP is going to win the elections and a last attempt to do improve the gadhha bandhan.and he has to explain  how a looter like lalu going to improve the lives of muslimis, dalits?</comment>

<comment>Dear Author, just one sentence reveals your attitude and the attitude of the community you belong: "To many, Owaisi’s persona represents the possibility of being a religious Muslim and yet be accomplished in the modern sense of it" You seem to clearly imply that in the normal course, if you are religious you just cannot have a modern outlook. By the way your sense of modern is also something to be debated given that you seem to classify a bigot like Mr Owaisi as modern</comment>

<comment>Suddenly, bhakts have found an ocean of positive attributes in Owaisi. *sniff, sniff*, daal mein kuchh kala hai.</comment>

<comment>The author Ajaz is a bigot and you are an moron to take it assume things. You all prefer to be ruled by a convicted laalu than root for development of all. shame on you. what owaisi is doing is the similar to what pre-independent muslim league did.</comment>

<comment>Bigots, irrespective of the ideology they subscribe to, have the same mental build-up and may be carrying identical DNA (Modi can throw some light on this). No wonder, in Owaisi and his ilk, the Sangh Parivar has got an old friend.</comment>

<comment>And Congress is crying that Owaisi is eating into their favorite vote-bank</comment>

<comment>suddenly moorgs became hater of owaisi?</comment>

<comment>Don't know. My perception about Owaisi hasn't changed though. He is a scum. Bhakts can type keywords "Owaisi hate speech" in Youtube and enjoy his vitriolic comments about Hinduism.</comment>

<comment>I think you should watch his video when he was in Pakistan. The man is a die-hard Indian. It doesn't affect me one little bit what he thinks inside his head as long as he delivers development and keeps the country secure.</comment>

<comment>He can definitely keep our country secure by delivering hate-speeches and inciting Hyderabadi mob to ignite riots.</comment>

<comment>All is forgiven if Owaisi can deliver a Congress mukht Bharath :P</comment>

<comment>Right. Even at the cost of an Owaisi-yukt Bihar.</comment>

<comment>Is Mr. Owaisi a Sunni muslim or a Shia muslim?</comment>

<comment>Brother... He is a sunni Muslim... But ISIS is not a Muslim organization in any case... Both Sunni and Shia Muslims are against ISIS...  It is purely anti Islamic organization.. believe me all the leading Ulamas from around the world has clearly proved ISIS to be anti Islamic. this organization came into existence to defame Islam and Muslims...</comment>

<comment>Don't blow the same old bugle...This is crime against islam in the name of islam...Saudi is fully supporting ISIS. So many muslims from India have attempted to join ISIS. Thousands of sunni muslims from all over the world have migrated to live under the caliphate. You cannot just wash your hands saying this is anti-islamic...If this is anti-islamic, what has the Islamic world done so far for destroying it? NOTHING.</comment>

<comment>Sunni, why?</comment>

<comment>See my other posts...He might be the launch pad of ISIS in India..</comment>

<comment>Hindu Muslim</comment>

<comment>From your comments, we can easily conclude that you are a Category 5 Moron (C5M) in the ranks of Sagarika Ghose and others.</comment>

<comment>Sunni and his forefathers where part of infamous razakars in nizams Hyderabad proveince who terrorized,killed Hindus</comment>

<comment>If he is a Sunni muslims, there are good chances that he will be the launch pad of ISIS in India...Have never heard Mr. Owaisi making any negative statement about ISIS. I think ISIS is going to appoint him the Emir of Khurasan region (India + Pak + Afghan)</comment>

<comment>I don't agree at all. These are not his views as far as I can tell. He seems like a fine chap to me so far.</comment>

<comment>Yes Yes, he is a fine chap...Just give him 15 minutes and he will show you how fine he is...</comment>

<comment>I disagree buddy, he was probably the first one to criticize the Katua brigade called ISIS. Before you start lashing out at me, I am a registered BJP member :)</comment>

<comment>I am apolitical and I don't care whether you are Congressi, Bhakt, Aaptard, or shoe  licker of Mayawati...Share the link where Owaisi criticized ISIS</comment>

<comment>search for "Owasi criticizes ISIS" in google.</comment>

<comment>We have a severe minority problem. Muslims, Sikhs, Christians stand in the way of India to become super power.</comment>

<comment>Minority appeasement problem, started by the shitbag Nehru and followed by his progeny.</comment>

<comment>i dont think so, may be he will become leader of loo washers in ISIS capital. Arab and middle east muslims are smart enough to keep outsiders inferior to them. no amount of crying will make a non-arabic asian muslim similar to arabic.</comment>

<comment>what you mean by Kafirs...</comment>

<comment>Isis will slaughtered by Russians Wait and watch</comment>

<comment>should happen</comment>

<comment>Nah...ISIS is not going anywhere...Russians are there to kill the moderate rebels and not ISIS...Ultimately, it will be ISIS (Saudi) vs. Assad (Iran)</comment>

<comment>No. I think Russians are there for a reason. They want to show that they are better than Americans to manage Syria situation. The end of war is near.</comment>

<comment>This is just the start of war...Wait until it catches fire...India is very very vulnerable this time...because India will have to fight on both internal and external fronts..External: Pakistan, supported by China + ISISInternal: Naxalites, Maoists, Pakistan and ISIS supportersIt is going to be very tough and exhausting war...Be prepared. Or else, migrate to a developed country if you can.</comment>

<comment>Dude. Relax. IS is growing weak by the day. No one can take that kind of pounding. I mean France, Aus, Russia, USA, Turkey are all pounding their ahss on a daily basis. Soon others will join</comment>

<comment>Yes, the whole country has been relaxing for last 70 years and the results are in front of you...10 years back, India was compared with China...But now people are comparing it with Brazil...RELAX for few more years, and you will be compared with Sudan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Congo, Chad, Zimbabwe, and other fifth world countries. NOW GO and RELAX!</comment>

<comment>I never read 10 yrs back India was compared to ChinaBrazil is a troubled economy  and India is doing far better</comment>

<comment>Search google for "economist india vs china"Yes, Brazil is a troubled economy which will be hosting olympics...India is a far better economy not even being able to bid for olympics...are you dud face or what?</comment>

<comment>Mr.Owasi is probably the most complex and also the smartest politicians I have seen in recent times, compared to him Kejriwal comes across as a destructive one dimensional personality. That said I am finding it difficult to understand this gentleman. I will list out those points below1. He talks of eliminating Haj subsidy and using the money for Muslim girl education, but at the same time keeps quiet when the regressive AIMPLB refuses to relook at muslim womens rights!!! Is Mr.Owasi playing to the gallery ?2. He talks about India's plurality but refuses to criticize his brother when that poisonous fellow makes terrible comments about Hindu gods!!! are the Owasi brothers playing good cop, bad cop?3. This gentleman talks about scholarship for muslim girls but criticizes Maha. govt when it abolishes subsidy for madrasas with the sole intention of providing modern education to Indian children who follow Islamic religion. I fail to understand the duplicity of Mr. Owasi.4. Mr.Owasi talks of under-representation of muslims in the parliament, is he of the opinion that only muslims should represent muslims? This is a democracy for god's sake, a well educated leader like him should put merit over religion. To be fair to him all the pigs in all political parties follow different versions of the same practice.5. Does Mr.Owasi really share the pain and isolation of poor muslims? if he does why was he quiet all these years and only talk about it after the destruction ofthe divisive, communal and dynastic Congress party? Is he just a shrewed politician who has sensed an opportunity to play to the gallery and continue with the cynical and exploitative politicis of the Congress?6. Lastly Mr.Swapan dasgupta made an observation that Mr.Owasi is probably looking to raise to the national mainstream as a "Muslim" leader and then share power with the center not as an Indian but as a "Muslim", this would be very dangerous in my opinion as it will fail to completely integrate and mainstream those Indians who follow the Islamic religion.This is my observation and I would welcome an objective debate on a very interesting politician.</comment>

<comment>i refuse to debate this sensible commentary! </comment>

<comment>Do  you think our andhe koons (pseudo seculars) can read this? They will be by the time over blowing some other controversy</comment>

<comment>He is divisive and dangerous because he is another Jinnah in the making and not a silly vagabond like RaGa - who says one thing and means something else.</comment>

<comment>The cooked-up survey widely published today which predicted landslide victory for BJP is only an attempt to force AIMIM to withdraw from the elections.  Can't imagine our media has stooped so low !</comment>

<comment>The best scenario would be Owaisi fights, he splits the muslim votes, BJP wins, Grand Alliance is decimated.Thereafter, Owaisi lets go of his anti-hindu rhetoric, sticks to his development talk and aligns with BJP to pursue development of muslims as well</comment>

<comment>really? see MIM's history right from razakars to Hyderabad politics till now. you know what they have done during regular communal riots, whom they allied with and the rhetoric. don't be a moron.</comment>

<comment>Ajaz Ashraf writes "A victorious BJP in Bihar will have the Hindutva hotheads assert themselves, as has been seen elsewhere, thereby further fanning the insecurities of the Muslim community elsewhere"How can FP allow such biased statements/ opinions?</comment>

<comment>ajaz is an example for an educated muslim is still a mussie rather than educated</comment>

<comment>Did Sonia, Lalu and Nitish leave you a suitcase full of cash in order to write this desperate plea of an article? Next article from you "Modi, for the social fabric of our nation, please exit Bihar elections!"</comment>

<comment>lol.</comment>

<comment>Modiji is going to win Bihar for sure...sabarmati ke saant ka danka pure Hindustan mein bajega....Modiji is greatest Indian ever born....if he was born before 1947 he would have been father of nation not Gandhiji....</comment>

<comment>Let us name his as "son of the father of the nation" - would that satisfy your zeal?</comment>

<comment>What bjp is for Hindus ,owaisi is for Muslims</comment>

<comment>Owaisi is for radical, fundamentalist muslims... Educated muslims and even hindus should rather pi$$ in Owaisi's mouth.....</comment>

<comment>The moment I looked at the title, I knew the author would belong to Owaisi's community - "even ignoble, voices demand that he pull out from the electoral arena"... ya - as per him everyone else is "ignoble".</comment>

<comment>Ajaz-ji,Didn't expect this article from you. Today, Mr. Owaisi has emerged as the lone hope for 25 crore Indian Muslims. You are asking him to withdraw from the polls! I think you are at the risk of FATWA by maulana sahebs....</comment>

<comment>What about miyan Lalu and <iyan nitish,="" both="" spread="" hatred="" and="" fear="" amongst="" the="" minorities.....they="" should="" also="" be="" hammered=""></comment>

<comment>Lalu Prasad's elder son Tej Pratap Yadav is 25 and younger son Tejaswi Yadav is 26 as per the affidavits filed by them with their nomination papers for Mahua and Raghopur assembly seats. Moreover Tej Pratap passed intermediate in 2010 from Bihar School Examination Board, and has assets worth Rs 1.12 crore and loan of over Rs 18 lakh. Tejaswi, on the other hand, passed Class IX in 2006 from DPS RK Puram, New Delhi, and has assets worth Rs 1.40 crore and loan of Rs 34 lakh. How these morons become crorepati before working anywhere... Fodder scam money it seems... Strange family this and even stranger the people who vote for them</comment>

<comment>Please don't take those meme too seriously, Yes the once crafted by Sanghi internet brigade and its activists...</comment>

<comment>Here is the answer you idiot....Tejaswi Yadav is an acclaimed cricketer and he has earned this money by playing cricket in several counties...Tej Pratap on the other hand is a model and earned this money by modeling.</comment>

<comment>India is not what it used to be before 2014. The aggressive rhetoric of Owaisi is consolidating Major community votes. The days of psuedo-secularists and fellow travellors are numbered. Now people are interested in jobs,corruption free development and development only.</comment>

<comment>Let Pisslamist Owaisi fight elections. Lets see how many muslims vote for him.If the Pisslamist does not fight, then we will come to know true hindu power</comment>

<comment>Media presttiutes and TV channel anchors like arnooob, burkkka, rajdeep sardeasi and others  and all anti-hindu jehhadis and vaaticcan agents and friends will do all possible tricks, but bihar voters have decided to dump all the daoicts and friends like lalooo, nitish, kezriwaal, communists to dustbin soon in Bihar roo.See the greatest joke of past 2000 years, the semtic cults issslma and chrrristainity and their terrror manuuals qurraan and bibbble which preach 24 hours a day for the past 2000 years against others or kafeeersor infidellls like hindus,sikhs, buddhists are called secular loving religions and have done goennicde of milllions and milllions of kafeeers and infideesl during the past 2000 years and followers of these hate&terrorcults have wiped out thousands of other inidgenotus cultures all over the world including hindussstan and world and the all loving hindus religions whihtouyt kafeeers or infideels and preaching whoole world as one family is called communal, are we not living in a banana republic or banana world?For permanent peace and harmony in the world both the baove hate cults issslaam and chritainity must be banned and only all-loving eastern religgions like hinduism, buddhism,shintoism, conficionism,etc must be allowedall over the world.</comment>

<comment>Now the mood of bihar voters is to dump all crooks and csoits and agents like nitish,lalooo, sooonia., kezriwaal and all friends of dynasty daocits to dustbin though the slaves and robots of dynasty dacoits&friens including the media and TV channels and cnhors and newspapers will do their best to make the dynasty and dacoit friends like lalllo, mulaya etc to win in Bihar, buy indian voters with help fro  internet and scial media cannot be fooled any more as was evident in the 2014 lok sabha elections. So son nehru dynasty, laloo parry, nitish party kexriwaal party and communits will be history and will be late  politicial parties too</comment>

<comment>Owaisi will stay because Congress and the so called secularbut minority appeasement forces have let down the minorities which they milkfor votes. Yes the minorities give votes because they don’t want to vote forBJP, but they don’t get anything back. In fact, the whole country loses andgets looted by these secular forces (read Congress). So now maybe someminorities will vote for Owaisi just for a change to see his brand of politics.Which will be great for BJP as votes will be split. BJP is going to fk the restthis time in Bihar.</comment>

<comment>The writer shows his bias. He holds BJP responsible for the lynching in UP. UP is with Samajwadi Party. How is BJP responsible for the heinous crime ? It is a media created fear psychosis that Muslims are afraid in India. They have all the freedom they want. There have been enough instances when Muslims targeted Hindus. Godhra incident is a prime example.In Hyderabad, muslims regularly harass, insult and attack the Hindus. Muslims when in majority ruthlessly impose their way of life on others. J & K is an example where the Hindus were ethnically cleansed, their hoes burnt and their properties taken over by the majority muslims. When they are in a minority they sing the tune of secularism, democracy.The cause of all the problems in the muslim community is that they are more interested in their scriptures rather than working and studying hard. I have nothing against their interest in their Holy books, but to blame the Hindus for their (muslims) laziness is hypocrisy.</comment>

<comment>Because 8 of the 10 accused in the lynching act are related to BJP... If you had cared to read a bit rather than vomit here..</comment>

<comment>EXPLAIN---Why shouldn't you be arrested for SEDITION charges?</comment>

<comment>...why talk about Hyderabad, it is the case in Mumbai, Bangalore and elsewhere, wherever they have dominated, it is their way. They give a damn to simple things like road rules and this writer expects everyone to salute them!</comment>

<comment>That  is the case with christain desrt cult too, both the desrt cults are hate preaching and terro preaching and for permanent peace and harmony both theaboce hate cults must be Banned and that is the only solution for violence and keeelings all over the world too.It is time for Modiji to take the bull by the horn and convince all non-muzzlims and non-christains that the followers of desrt cults issslam anchristainity are mst hatefilled anterro rpeaching personsof the whole world for the ast 2000 years and more Modiji should have active and close collaboration with all mon-muzzzlims and non-christaisn nations and fight the eveil forces of issslam and christainity to save the world from more terror and hatred and violence forever too.The hate preacching ans terrror preaching by followers of hate&terror cults issslm and christainity has been going on for past 2000 years and unless they are banned there can never be peace andharmony in the world. Read indian and world histty history and see how followers of hate&terro cutls issslm and chriistainity have done genocides of millions and millions of others or kafeeers or infidels like hindus,siskhs, budddheists, etc and still coninue with those gennocides of others or forcefulconversion of otehers or kafffer andinfidels without any control too. The realproblem for eliminating terrror and genocide from the world is to ban the hatepreaching and terror preaching by isssslm and christainity and the terror manuals qurrran and bibbble,</comment>

<comment>Hahahahha...what a lame article written on behalf of the sickular parties!The writer should know that Owaisi has capacity to get more seats than the Congress that has been in Bihar for 60 yrs and that is very good achievement in his first election!</comment>

<comment>Please Mr. Owaisi, listen to their prayers and quit. After all this is a battle of survival for the "Psecular" parties. And on top of that it is a Psecular (Italian Bar girl + Chaara chor + Nitish "Ishrat ke Abbu" Kumar + His Honesty Shri Shri 1008 Kejriwal jee) vs Communal (Modi) fight.</comment>

<comment>Yes Ajaz Mian, Owaisi should exit, Mulla M should exit, Pappu should hide somewhere - all hindrances should be removed so that your beloved Lalua-Nitisswa sickular combo wins somehow ! If sickulars keep getting knocked out in state after state, who will pay for your vitriolic outpourings ?</comment>

<comment>In future, Owaisi will be able to play the role of King Maker in some of the states. And that future is a few years (15 years, I presume) away from now. There would be two major political ideology in distant future, Majority-pro and Minority-pro.</comment>

<comment>You forgot the pimps, the pseudo secular brigade of the majority.</comment>

<comment>I can visualize that. If thugs like Lallu and Devegowda can be kingmakers then what's there to stop Owaisi!!</comment>

<comment>WTH?  You want mahalathbandan to win becoz you think" For one, security is a predominant factor behind the voting choice of Muslims, as umpteen surveys have shown. This is what turns them into an implacable opponent of the BJP."Have you any data from RAJ,  CG,  MP,  GOA,  MAH,  JHK,  HAR to back your claim that minorities are suffering in these states?  I deliberately did not put GUJ becoz despite 12 years of riot free rule your needle will be stuck at 2002And you call yourself a journalist ??? Who is suppised to write in a professional unbiased manner.....shame on you,  you filthy swine</comment>

<comment>In the states u mentioned  ruling party is now BJP where people were voting for secular parties supported by all sections of Hindus.What is the reason for Hindus moving from secular parties? Have u ever analysed what is going on other states such as Assam,WB, TN, Telegana,Karnataka,Kerala, UP where secular parties are in power and what is wrong with the secularism there? Secularist journalists and media cannot afford to demean democracy taking the issues like beef eating.They do not feel cruelty to animal is not like cruelty to poor. It is a pity Indian media is still thriving on non substantial issues with all types of hate mongers in the studio against majority Indians.</comment>

<comment>When in the past he has been in alliance with Congress, why is the author trying to maintain that he is keeping equi-distance with Congress and BJP.Under no circumstances he is going to support BJP.When will these writers stop such a lopsided articles.</comment>

<comment>FIRSTPOST PLEASE STOP THESE BIASED AND COMMUNALY CHARGED REPORTS. THE MEDIA HAS LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED TO DAMAGE THE SOCIAL FABRIC AND HARMONY AND THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE COUNTRY INDIA IN COHORT WITH THIER SIKULAR,FLIBERALS AND THE PSUEDO SIKULAR BRIGADE.</comment>

<comment>Everybody knows the OWAISI's allegiance to the Congress, They partnered the UPA Govt and the Congress in the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh. He played a major role in cohort with his congi masters to divide the state into two parts. The writer of this article must have got lot of dough from Pappu and his congi masters and the sikular brigade to write this article. The MAHAgathbandhan is foreseeing its future and they know they will be wiped out in this election so whoever opposes this Gathbandhan will be PRO-BJP FOR THEM.HE IS REPORTING OR WRITING WHAT HIS SIKULAR MASTERS HAVE ORDERED HIM TO WRITE.THE WRITER HAS NOT THROWN LIGHT ON THE MATCH FIXING BETWEEN THE  OWAISI'S, SP AND THE MAHATHUG BANDHAN.SP AND NCP HAVE PARTED WAYS AS PER THE GAMEPLAN FROM THE MAHAGATHBANDHAN, NOT GETTING ENOUGH SEATS AND THE SUBSEQUENT INSULT OR LOSS OF PRESTIGE, STATUS AND FACE IS JUST A RUISE BEING EMPLOYED BY THESE SIKULAR THUGS.THE REALITY IS MULAYAM AND LALU ARE RELATIVES LALU'S DAUGHTER IS MARRIED INTO MSY'S FAMILY SO LALU IN HIS DREAMS WILL NOT THINK OF ANTOGONISING HIS SAMDHI I.E. MSY.AS PER THE GAMEPLAN THEY ALL HAVE BEEN PROPPED UP BY THE CONGI'S TO COUNTER THE BJP LED NDA ALLIANCE AND EAT INTO THEIR VOTESHARES. ONCE THE ELECTIONS ARE OVER ALL OF THEM CAN COME TOGETHER AND STITCH AN ALLIANCE TO FORM THE GOVT.BUT THE GAME PLAN HAS BACKFIRED ON THE MAHATHUGBANDHAN. THE GROUND REALITY IS DIFFERENT. NOBODY IN BIHAR WANTS THE REPEAT OF THE JUNGLE RAJ WHICH LALU IS FAMOUS FOR, AND MANY OF THEM HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THE BHAGALPUR RIOTS AND THE ATROCITIES ON THE DALITS AND MAHA DALITS WHEN THE CONGRESS HAD RULED THE STATE.NOW THE MAHATHUGBANDHAN WANTS ALL THE PARTIES WHO HAVE BEEN PROPPED UP BY THEM TO COUNTER BJP LED NDA TO WITHDRAW FROM THE ELECTIONS BECAUSE INSTEAD OF HARMING THE BJP, THESE PARTIES ARE EATING INTO THE VOTES AND VOTE SHARES OF THE MAHATHUGBANDHAN. SO THEY ARE DESPERATE NOW.YOU WILL SEE AS ELECTIONS ARE COMING CLOSER MANY OF THE CANDIDATES OF THE LEFT SPONSORED THIRD FRONT, SP, NCP, OWAISIS AIMIM OR THE OTHER PARTIES WHO ARE FIGHTING AGAINST THE BJP LED NDA WILL WITHDRAW IN FAVOUR OF THE MAHATHUGBANDHAN OR THE VICEVERSA MAY ALSO HAPPEN WHERE THE MAHATHUGBANDHAN MAY WITHDRAW THEIR CANDIDATES OR SUPPORT THESE CANDIDATES WHERE THEY ARE LOSING OR THEIR CANDIDATES ARE WEAK AS COMAPRED TO THESE PARTIES.</comment>

<comment>Secularists want power through Lalu - Nitish because Owaisi will take all the power himself and give them a kick.</comment>

<comment>Ajaz Ashraf, your paid articles not gona affect owaisi or his votes......owaisi can say congress or Nitish has no parental right to fool muslims and get their votes....owaisi would say, whether paid craps like Ajaz Ashraf would decide his politics....??? is entering and exiting so easy like fukng articles of him?? </comment>

<comment>The elder owasi has some good ideas. Even during A.P bifurcation he was the only one  who brought legitimate concerns to the room among all the squabbling politicians. But their  motives regarding the non-Muslims is not clear, esp the hate speeches the chota owaisi delivers. In his defence of his brother his intentions become clear. And these people have the gall to call BJP divisive and non secular. Clearly owasi has the potential to uplift the Muslims but the question is can he integrate them into the mainstream without further deepening the communal divide? </comment>

<comment>Sickulars desperate to promote Sickularists :-)</comment>

<comment>Owaisi has mastered the art of presenting a false front and trying to convince the Muslims of India that he alone is their saviour. While Muslims,  who were thoroughly disenchanted, disgusted and sick of the 'secular' hypocrisy that was carried on smugly and arrogantly by Congress for over 60 years, kicked the Congress where it hurts most in 2014, they were not yet fully ready to accept Owaisi at his word. As suspected, after tasting some success, he has now proved to be as rabidly communal as he is accusing the BJP of being.  It is poetic justice that he should draw flak for an 'underhanded'  agreement with the BJP, of all parties, to sabotage the so called illusory  "Secular" heroes.  All these false propagandists deserve each other.</comment>

<comment>Sick writer....go collect your pay now......change the dumbo's diaper on your way out.Pig-journos like you bring disrepute to the other 20%honest people in journalism. </comment>

<comment>This is the most embarrassing , blood sucking situation of Indian politics. All the garbage jihadi can  camouflage himself in to a secularist and write his hate filled propaganda everywhere.</comment>

<comment>Let me summerize the article: Author wants Owasi to leave Bihar election for the benefit of JDU, RJD and Congress alliance.</comment>

<comment>Terse. :-) funny </comment>

<comment>More than that. Author says the only purpose of Muslims is to be vote bank of 'seculars'. Their role is to faithfully vote against BJP! They don't need any other perspective!Owaisi is communal and divisive. But, about muslim progress he makes sense. He says Muslims have been deprived of growth because they have been kept away from education & modernity. He speaks of the need for massive Muslim women schooling & employing them in jobs. This is unique in muslim leadership which is largely speaking in terms fo Sharia etc.I'd rather have a Owaisi like politician representing muslim interests than Mulayam Singh, Laloo Yadav types. He is atleast upfront about his agenda.</comment>

<comment>I agree, the "secular" forces have been taking minorities for a ride for years. However aligning with the likes of Owaisi push people further to the communal divisions in place of bringing them together. Unfortunately there is no good political option available for communal harmony. Even people with a reach such as this author focus on political gains of a few elites, and not on the benefit of the masses.</comment>

<comment>No my point is - Author thinks Owaisi leaving the field will automatically mean vote for JDU-RJD-Congress!But, most opinion polls indicate about 30% muslims will vote for NDA!!!So, the premise that if Owaisi is not there those votes will go to JDU-Alliance is shitheaded. Statistically a portion will go to NDA too!</comment>

<comment>He wrote one page crap to just say that.</comment>

<comment>It's not just one page, he kept writing, however hard to continue after reading a couple paragraphs. Luckily we have brains and we can read between the lines to identify a hidden motive.</comment>

<comment>"victims of its (bjp's) divisive programmes" 😱😱😱"his neatly trimmed beard add to his mystique" 😹😹😹 I fell off my bed... lOl!!!!"To demonstrate that he is a practitioner of subaltern politics, he must turn to Uttar Pradesh and seek to cobble an alliance with the BSP."🐐🐐🐐"But before withdrawing from Bihar he could demand a guarantee from his community leaders that they wouldn't ask him to sit out of the UP polls, " 😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😱😱😱😱😱🙈🙉🙊HahaHahaHahahahaHahahahahahahahahahahaBhai whatever pipe you are smoking from, the smoke doesn't still screen your desperation. So, then don't write condescendingly about this man. He is a rabid Islamist, but still one with brains who is calling the pseudosecular parties'bluff. And that makes Mr. Ashraf very nervous. So, if you want to ask, ask straight. Beg him to stay out of the Bihar polls so that anti BJP votes don't scatter. I think Mr. Owaisi will put a very fine dent for the pseudosecular parties that in some cases will hopefully benefit the BJP. 😂😂😂😂</comment>

<comment>True, you have to hand it to Owaisi for not being hypocritical like the pseudo-secular adarsh liberals.</comment>

<comment>mR.Ajaz Ashraf  why are you afraid of telling people that you are bating for Sonia/Pappu &  Lallu & you received lot of dough for that from pappu?</comment>
