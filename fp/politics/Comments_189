<comment>In the interest of fair journalism a conflict of interest note regarding the author's background should have included at the end of the article. This would provide a clear sense to the reader on the basis and bias of the opinions mentioned here. I rest my case.</comment>

<comment>The truth is that PDP has lost the support of the people in the Valley,therefore Mehbooba is in a delima whether to continue with BJP or look elsewhere. Difficult task for the lady with little leadership qualities and administration skills.I doubt whatever option she takes...her Govt will not survive the entire term of the assembly.</comment>

<comment>wat a biased article..Mehbooba with no CM experience is indeal candidate but Omar is not..whole article is to show BJP is bad light indirectly saying Anyone is ok expcept BJP</comment>

<comment>Thoroughly biased and bigoted - very difficult for a normal Indian to read it completely. Why are such anti-nationals aloud to write such rabid rot and spread utter negativity ?</comment>

<comment>first i did not understand the meaning of this article. Secondly, Mr Devdas has been working Governor of the Jammu and Kashmir for years and that could be reason he writes this line  (Meanwhile, the stateâ€™s administration is in the very capable hands of Governor NN Zohra.) and i don't know what has happened to firstpost, this is the reason behind the slow death of the brand. This is not what we were used to reading on this website.</comment>

<comment>You just secretly want her to join congress, just spit it out you moron.</comment>
