<comment>Mayawati is talking a lot of gibberish. None of the Dalit attacks were investigated when Indra Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were prime ministers, or for that matter when Narasimha Rao and Dr. Man Mohan Singh were in power. Now, the CBI investigates everything under Narendra Modi, and even then the opposition cries a lot accusing him. Rahul Gandhi just does Caucasian show business and does not do anything, and he is desperately seeking power in a completely losing situation.  Mayawati is a defeated politician who is desperately seeking some publicity, especially when she is well certified for being accused of violence, battery and corruption of the highest order in Uttar Pradesh..</comment>

<comment>why not media report whole issue ...why to do lazy journalism, and run headlines with certein templates....like it or not rld just banks on jatt votes used to win haryana elections, it is only bjp which changed the trend with non jatt cm</comment>

<comment>Excuse me behenji aap kaun hai? Press conference was necessary for time pass now that you have no statues to build and no one comes to you with diamond gifts?</comment>

<comment>this incident should have been induced by congress peoplehariyana govt sent notice to vadra on the land deals recentlyhis brother in law need to give pressure to the govt and take the focus awaycreated this incident.. brother in law was stand by to visit this villagenow, entire focus is on upper caste and lower caste. vadra is relieved for some times. anyone deny??i am deeply saddened about this incident causing death of innocent young children. heart is bleeding to hear this news.no one, whether he belongs to upper caste or lower caste deny that the culprits must be punished with the maximum punishment.while most of the media is writing about the personal fude between these families, why don't they write more about the incident which caused this enmity? is it true that a year ago some of the upper caste people also killed by these people. why play caste card in all these kind of personal enmities between two individual families.then, what is wrong in rss chief arguing that the reservations must be based on economical backwardness, not on the caste. when india moves towards the great suggestion from rss chief, the castesim will be vanished</comment>

<comment>divide and rule policy- divide dalits ,Hindu's and Sikh's so that the mission of islamization goes on silently in india and then create mass killing of kafirs like what happen in Syria, Iraq,and Nigeria.</comment>

<comment>You are absolutely correct.</comment>

<comment>Media doesnt require to hide its biases now. An old conflict between two families/groups that ended up killing people on both sides is being presented as "atrocities on dalits under bjp rule". How much more low can the reporters and editors stoop?</comment>

<comment>why media is so selective? a month ago, in up, a dalit boy was beheaded just because he was married to a muslim girl by the girl's family?? dalits are hindu so don't create confusion.</comment>

<comment>really, do dalit -jat fighting is first time happened in hariyana. after 60 years of mislead, dalit now came to know that they are just a use and throw pen used by fake dalit leader  like mayawati, that why her popularity goes down to 0 in dalit community.</comment>

<comment>Mayavatiji,  Dont listen to Holy Cow ... he is communal</comment>

<comment>She was in slumber until she heard someone say "Dalit", jumped out of the bed and said "Dalits feeling insecure under BJP govt", because she believes the statues of her were protecting dalits in UP for 5 years.</comment>

<comment>Your statement is very humorous, and yet very accurate too.</comment>
