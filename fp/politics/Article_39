Srinagar:Â Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah today termed as "unacceptable" the "hounding" of Kashmiri students in Delhi and making them "convenient scapegoats" on the name of crackdown on anti-national activities in JNU."If the Delhi Police and the Home Ministry want to unleash a dictatorial and tyrannical crackdown on dissenting voices and students in Delhi, they should not make Kashmiri students convenient scapegoats, stigmatize them and ruin their careers. This is unacceptable," Omar said.Omar Abdullah. PTIThe National Conference (NC) working president said there have been numerous instances in the past when the Delhi Police had cited intelligence inputs to "falsely implicate young Kashmiris" in Delhi only to be acquitted by the courts after years of incarceration.Now, the recent decision to "hound" Kashmiri students in JNU and other colleges seems to be another addition to this chapter, he said."We express our resentment against the stereotyping and maligning of Kashmiri students and demand that the Government of India desists from ruining their careers for the benefit of political expediency," he said.Omar said such policies of selective persecution and profiling adds to the perception of alienation and isolation among the youth of the state. This is extremely "unfortunate" and we will not remain silent and allow their en-masse persecution, the NC working president said.PTI
