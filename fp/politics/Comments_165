<comment>We all know what pollsters had predicted in Delhi assembly</comment>

<comment>Drivers, fitters, cooks are running away from the Socialist/reservationparadise, India.BJP is very timid. Jo dar gaya samjo who margaya. Modi should get bold and announce free gun laws to get votes. The appeal is very popular and very basic as Republican party of USA will tell. It was because of Vajpayee's Gandian socialism that BJP got reduced to two seats in the past. It was Vajpayee's socialism and not shining India which was responsible for debacle for BJP the last decade.Regarding Rahul Gandhi "Land bill is for corporates", Kiran Majumdhar Shaw, made a good point that Rahul Gandhi is dividing people - a charge made against BJP/RSS by seculars. The mother of all communalism was the schism created by Marx by his bourgeoisie and proleteriat. Gandhi Topis are communal in the extreme. They are inventing one communalism after another by inventing one holy cow after another - this time it is farmers. I want to catch hold of Lal Bhadur Shastri and ask him are other humans not humans, apart from Jawan and Kisan? In this process, raping economy[non-violent rape of economy!], Rupee has collapsed from Rs. 4 = 1 dollar in 1947 to Rs.74 = 1 dollar in 2013. If the same state of affairs continues rupee will sink to Rs.10000 = 1 dollar. Even the holy cow, farmers, are led into the paradise literally - India has become suicide capital of the world. It is fashionable, for some to argue that ANY exchange rate is OK - forgetting that with a country with zero productivity will have an infinitely low value of currency, say with respect to say Gold. Raping the economy does not pay - but that does not mean I support artificially support a fixed exchange rate. I am questioning CONTINUOUS devaluation in UNOFFICIAL exchange rate.Also devaluation against gold should not be forgotten. In 1947, 11.66 grams[tola] of Gold was Rs.103. That represents a 12% devaluation annually. However assuming 3% increase in volume of gold production increase every year - there has been 9% devaluation every year. That is due to sin of legal robbery of socialism[as distinct from charity]</comment>

<comment>Well, as it happens, drivers, fitters and cooks are coming from Bangladesh and Nepal to fill in. A trip around Kerala will make it clear.</comment>

<comment>Latest Zee news poll shows NDA 162 and alliance 52.  They have sample size of 54000 by far the largest so far and hence most reliable.</comment>

<comment>every one knows abt those stupids</comment>

<comment>AAP has following support base:a) Voters that are from Religions of Peace (basically transferred from Congress)b) Left Libs/psuedo college going/flunked college typesc) Gullible varietyd) Muftkhoor - wanting free stuff without worke) Hard core corrupt and criminalsf) Extensive Media network g) India hatersLayer on top of this voter base a very cunning mind in terms of AK sir.If any other party has to win election against AAP, going forward, few things they can do:Educate voters so that (b) and (c) become smart, portion of (a) realize that what is good for them and not do heard mentalityIn long term, make people appreciate hard work so that level of (d) goes downAAP will still retain rest of the base.Delhi was a sweet spot for AAP as it optimized and maximized a-g voter base.Feel free to use my a-g classification system of AAP voters  when u interact with them in online forums and social media--------------------------------------- Yours truly, PhD in AAP studies</comment>

<comment>you are such an idiot who supports terrorist, killers and criminals..</comment>

<comment>Nithis  should not have gone with Lalu which would be a cause to worry. Lalu will get swept of by the Bihar voters for sure and the congress along with it</comment>

<comment>what abt bjp ?? does he go with all time great killers of india?</comment>

<comment>This is one of the many surveys that have been conducted. All of them have shown mixed results and none of them have a history of accuracy. Lets wait for the polls and official results.</comment>

<comment>dont you remembers delhi polls..</comment>

<comment>Just few jewels for you mishraji! The poll says JDU will get 26% of total votes! Now 26%in 243 seats means 63%+ votes in 101 it is contesting i guess in that scenario it shd win all of them! SO ur guess is as good as mine that JDU number are fudged.Now on to congress it says 5% and they will win 20 seats. Again juxtapose it to 41 seats its 30% votes per seat. At that number in two cornered contest do you expect them to win 50% of seats your guess shd be as good as mine!Take a NAP and i guess you shd start worrying again as you come to right conclusion that the the poll is fudged. Now start worrying again abt BJP and pen a anti BJP article!</comment>

<comment>@mishra  when was it ever said to be a cakewalk for bjp in bihar ??? plz enlighten us ?? If any political pandit said so, he/she is the stupidest one. Even in lok sabha NDA was less than mahagatabhandan combined. So if things remain same since 2014, NDA wud loose. That's the trickiest part everyone understands except for Firstpost smarty pants. unlike other state elections since 2014, NDA actually has to improve its vote share to make this competitive. Needless to say FP, u have lot of work to come up with cogent articles.</comment>

<comment>BJP was a partner in Nitish-led JD(U)Govt.from 2005 to 2013 (8years out of 10 years)!</comment>

<comment>Anti Modi brigade at work. Get some sense guys. Look at ground reality</comment>

<comment>wooww. how many day you believe an liers of india and criminals of india.. you blind supporters of BJP..</comment>

<comment>This polls and prediction can never believed. What happened in Delhi, is good lesson. These are just for making sensation. All these channels will somersault. Even in Loksabha election these foolster go wrong. These pre poll surveys etc are cheating. The panellist who discuss donot have any work to do, so they come to TV shows to advertise themselves as celebrity. But their Knowledge is quiet shallow</comment>

<comment>महागठबंधन हुआ ही ये देख कर की लोक सभा चुनाव में की:भाजपा के 30% वोट पासवान के 5% वोट कुशवाहा के 3% वोट मिलकर 38% होते हुए भी जीत गएक्यूंकि दूसरी तरफलालू के 19% वोट नितीश के 16% वोट कांग्रेस के 9% वोट 43% होते हुए भी क्यूंकि अलग अलग थे सो हार गएऔर तो और वो लोक सभा चुनाव थे और लोग PM चुन रहे थे और उसमें मोदी की लहर चल रही थी !अब 2015 में विधान सभा चुनाव है, लोग CM चुन रहे हैं, और मोदी न सिर्फ CM नहीं बनेंगे बल्कि मोदी के डेढ़ साल के काम को भी लोग नाप रहे हैं! आखिर तब भी मोदी ने बिहार से कई वादे किये ही थे !लगता ऐसा ही है की लोक सभा वाला गठबंधन तब के अपने 38% से कुछ नीचे ही जायेगा और लोक सभा चुनाव का ही बिखरा हुआ 43% वाले लोगों का गठबंधन कुछ आगे ही बढ़ेगा !</comment>

<comment>this sounds fairly rational</comment>

<comment>Why do i get a feeling equal to waiting for result of a world cup final match.</comment>

<comment>because both are big money entertainment. and the  outcome will not serve any purpose</comment>

<comment>Bakhts have had big contribution. I mean not just in Bihar. Farmers still don't understand what will be the impact of beef ban on them.</comment>

<comment>That ban has been in place since decades, so rest easy.</comment>

<comment>Now all surveys have become paid. I don't know what is with people..why this blind support for BJP....especially since BJP is example of what all they detest - corruption, criminality, communalism, in governance.The entire anti congressism due to which the "mighty" UPA lost power at center was due to the Anna Hazare agitation and IAC. BJP had nothing to do with it, they just sneaked into a majority through the backdoor. I must agree their timing of announcing bhaashanbaaz as their PM candidate was perfect. And he just promised the moon to the already frustrated people who were angry with UPA.</comment>

<comment>UPA is corrupt, useless and dirty party. People no more allow dynasty rule stopping india growth. Lalu is scam convict and jungle raj fame as cried by Nitish. Nitish lost credibilityas he can't fight alone if he is really GOD & able administrator.  You can see the BJP win in election results. Be ready.............</comment>

<comment>Whether Shri Modi promised/ did not promise the Moon to the already frustrated people, they were already angry with UPA and even today the INC has not understood the mood and the aspirations of the people</comment>

<comment>Well yesterday and day b4 6 more surveys happened, CSDS-LokNeeti, ABP News, India News, India TV, Zee Tv and Times Now Cvoter gave better seats/majority to NDA... IBN and India Today to Mahalathbandhan....Some one obviously will be proved wrong....whether they are paid or not ... is anybody's guess.. and that Mishraji took only 1 survey as a base for his BS article also tells a lot about Misharji's neeyat</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>There is nothing to wonder. In the south many RSS boys consume beef and also take part in anti-beef campaigns</comment>

<comment>Its close call ...Nitish : 130...Modi..90</comment>

<comment>But, lets remember, its only a Paid pre-poll survey along with a paid article so no need to jump to conclusions.</comment>

<comment>I wish the writer of this piece had looked at the data of this pre-poll survey a bit more closely. Here are two points I find difficult to believe:1. That the Congress will win around half of the 40/41 seats it is contesting.2. More importantly, the vote shares. The survey projects a 26% vote share for JDU alone. Since the party is contesting only 100 seats, that means that its vote share in these seats would be a whopping 63%! Now that would be some performance!The survey may come out to be true but I do find the figures difficult to believe. And that is why I would never have written a piece based on these CNN-IBN findings. But then, we all know which side Mishraji's bread is buttered.</comment>

<comment>agreed, congress winning half of its seats is impossible</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Lalu is there to bring jungle raj. So Bihar oeople don't want jungle raj. BJP is going to win with full majority. Nitish credibility lost when he joined fodder scam convict jungle raj fame and utter corruot party. He is no more. he is touching lol feet..........</comment>

<comment>LALOO IS TRYING TO IMPOSE DYNASTY RULE IN BIHAR BY GIVING TICKETS TO HIS KITH & KIN FOR JUNGLE RAJ -2.</comment>

<comment>so is Ram vilas paswan... BJP Ally..... what is ur point !!</comment>

<comment>One of the BJP MP in Bihar itself has alleged that the Party is selling out tickets to criminals, gangsters, boot leggers, money bags, Dynasts etc.  In what way, the BJP is different ??</comment>

<comment>seems like serious money has changed hands . I think i should start a survey business . whoever pays max I wil put up a survey supporting them so that the common gullible public can fooled with presstitues out to publish whatever u tell :)</comment>

<comment>BJP WILL GET MORE THAN 200 SEATS PROVIDED IT ANNOUNCES FIRM PLAN TO CURB CORRUPTION & CONVICTION OF CORRUPTS IN BIHAR WHICH IS BIGGEST HURDLE FACED BY PEOPLE OF STATE. THE CORRUPTION IS CONTINUING SINCE LAST 60 YEARS OF CORRUPT & BAD GOVERNANCE BY TRIO CONGRESS-RJD-JD(U) WHO SHOULD NOT BE VOTED AGAIN IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHO ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ACUTE POVERTY & BACKWARDNESS ALL OVER STATE IN LAST 60 YEARS. BJP SHOULD NOT DELAY IN DECLARING WAR AGAINST CORRUPTION WHICH WILL ENSURE BJP VICTORY IN ASSEMBLY ELECTION. THE WIN OF RJD-JD(U) ALLIANCE WILL RUIN BIHAR FOREVER.</comment>

<comment>Only hope for lifting the sagged spirits of  the Bhakths now is to rekindle Zee News to come out with another instalment of its balderdash  survey.  I think Feku's PR Department will now be on an overdrive with that mission !!</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Play with colours...and different colour fonts, like pappu.</comment>

<comment>The people should see national interest which is beneficial for all rather than aligning with any party because all parties are equally corrupt but there is some check in national party while regional & smaller parties are pocket party of individual who are cheating people as they are master & there is no check over them. What Laloo & Nitish have done for Bihar is visible everywhere. These parties are useless & have no capability and vision to make development. Those voting to Laloo & Nitish are senseless people & are sealing their future which will result in acute poverty & backwardness in future also.</comment>

<comment>Modi ji already ruined the image of India by inserting his nose in to Nepal's constituition. Let's not give him any further chance to create more damage to the sovereignity of this country.</comment>

<comment>You lack the rational, logical and intellect of a tamilian. You spread fear like the pseudo intellectuals. For a tamilian, gratitude is god. Tamilians dont support cheaters and backstabbers. If at all you are like yettappan.Nitish had no reason to break away from NDA because MODI was nominated. His mandate by the state was based on his tie up with BJP. He should have continued until elections. He cheated the mandate to please his EGO. He cheated the BJP which believed him and also cheated bihar by running away because he could not deal with Modi. Then did lot of drama to come back.Finally he ties up with Lalu Prasad.</comment>

<comment>On your big response, I didn't find the word "Nepal". Would you please re-compose your response?</comment>

<comment>How can you unilaterally announce a Prime Ministerial candidate without consulting the alliance partners ?  That is what made Nitish vexed !!</comment>

<comment>I agree. and to think it was not discussed is naive. But the point is you cant please everybody. Do you think Nitish was a unanimous choice?The point is that in a democratic setup, you should behave with dignity and grace and accept the outcome and swallow your ego.Can you answer, why he gave up his CM post. It was nothing but his EGO.</comment>

<comment>In a perfect Democratic set up, you must not impose anybody on others.  The BJP is not declaring a Prime Ministerial candidate for itself but for the larger alliance.   Everybody is aware that Nitish has strong  reservations over Feku and so he surely must have been consulted before taking that decision.  And having announced it unilaterally naturally would have hurt its pride and incited its ego that he is being taken literally for granted !!Regarding his agreeing to give up his CM post, well it was a hugely emotional decision taken in the back drop of the severe mauling his party received in the Lok sabha polls. It is good that he took responsibility for that defeat and he showed grace there.  But where he committed a fault  was in coming back to the CM's chair once again  sensing that Manjhi was playing a trick upon him in cahoot with the BJP !!</comment>

<comment>exactly. he exhibited this pride and ego which is unbecoming of a statesman. and his present decision to tie up with lalu is a fake as people voted for him to get rid of Lalu.Also there is a contradication in what you say. I feel that Lok sabha results were not a assesment of nitish, It was of UPA 2. If lok sabha was indeed a refrendum, then as you said he should not have come back to power.What do you mean by Impose? Nitish had the option to be a part of NDA or not. How is that Impose.To be fair i thought that Jayalalitha was a much better choice for PM (but later the corruption thing came).Do you seriously consider  nitish a worthy  PM material.</comment>

<comment>There is just no point in talking about unprincipled alliances in India.  Every party does it without inhibition and moral scruples including the BJP which is the biggest sinner in this regard.  That is how unscrupulous and gutter politics is in play here where people are merely bystanders. I will not be pleasantly shocked even if Lalu and BJP join hands post polls !!Of course, it was indeed a Lok Sabha election, but the drubbing his party received emerging third prompted Nitish to take that emotional decision.  I also in my post clearly stated that he erred in coming back to power.  So, where I am contradicting  myself ? Perhaps, Manjhi's flirtations with BJP leaders and his attempts to  act smarter getting one better on Nitish by trying to engineer a split in the party to ensure his own stability also prompted Nitish to act the way he did.  But, still it was wrong in his part morally to.come back having taken a considered decision !!By imposition, I meant that Nitish as an important constituent should have been consulted and his views taken into account. But that never happened and  a decision was taken unilaterally asking the alliance partners to fall in line !!Of all, Jayalalitha for the PM post, the bounty queen who made a total mockery of the justice system in India and has also been recently acquitted on flimsy grounds with the controversial  verdict further  hurting the reputation of the already seriously battered judiciary ? You indeed have strange preferences ?Compared to Jayalalitha, Nitish is a far better choice for the PM's position !!</comment>

<comment>I agree. BJP is not holy. If BJP tie up with lalu they will face a similar irony. but the fact today is that they have not.As far as jayalalitha is concerned, i clearly posted her drawback. The point i wanted to make is that Nitish with is false sense of ego is not a PM material. The fact that he can tie up with congress against whom the LOK SABHA was a refrendum, shows that he is just a numbers man and not a statesman. He is like a child throwing tantrums if mom does not accept what he says.Anyway, it is only our views, and we are entitled to it. I appreciate your sensible replies and not abusing. In fact Modi's strength today is that the congress and parties like JDU is trying to make him out to be a monster.</comment>

<comment>IIT council is planning to increse the tuition fee to 150% and the proposal is about to be signed by the HRD ministry.Dear Bihar, please forget about your Children's IIT dream if you want to vote for BJP.</comment>

<comment>are you in your senses?. Are you saying that biharis will get free education in IIT if Nitish and Lalu wins.</comment>

<comment>Do you know why the land bill ordinance was withdrawn after multiple failed attempts? Bihar elections. So the same Bihar election may force them not do indulge in these kind of unnecessary fee hike.</comment>

<comment>Do you no who has lost due to withdrawal of land bills you moron? Not Modi but the economy and the jobs it may have created. You may love your Mnrega feast but we want to earn a living not leaving our fate at the footsteps of charitable Sonia Mata.</comment>

<comment>If Landbill is really for the development, what made him to withdraw it? Congress is not going to vote you but the people. If people know that landbill is a process for the development, why did he withdraw it just during the elections?</comment>

<comment>So are you saying that IIT will not raise fees if NDA loses. What kind of logic is this. First let there be IIT's. Students of bihar pay much more to travel all over the country and spend money on education. Get out of this freebee mentality. Just because you get free tv, fan, mixie, computers in tamil nadu does not mean that everybody will be equally foolish.</comment>

<comment>That's the difference between you and us. Your masters collect tax from you put it in their pockets. Out masters collect tax and spend it for the people though they put some in to their pocket. Nothing is free in this country. All those fan,mixe and laptops are bought from our tax money. How will it be a free if it's bought on my money? You people will never come out of mentality of worshipping politicians. Modi is your God, you can't think beyond. What ever he does is correct for you.That's the reason why we are standing top on all aspects. I am proud to be a Tamil.</comment>

<comment>So by that logic it is ok to distribute money and biryani and booze for elections. You are a disgrace to tamil culture.Tamil Nadu is respected for producing people like Anna, kamaraj and abdul kalam. and you are happy to be a parasite. As long as you also get a part of of the money, the leaders can indulge in corruption.you dont even understand that freebies are nothing but a bribe.No wonder DMK and AIADMK are the most powerful parties in TN inspite of being corrupt.</comment>

<comment>My money used for me is a bribe? Did you go to school? I will tell you what the real bribe is. Over 1000 crores of our money is being spent every month for the Z+ security of Bhagwat, Subrami Samy and Ramdev. How are these thugs related to government? Are they the elected representatives?I think, Modi worshippers can't understand these factors.</comment>

<comment>Which is your money. How much money did you pay and for what?. What you are shamelessly happy about enjoying is nothing but a burden on future of tamil nadu. Instead of investing that in productive infrastructure on which the future depends, you are happy to enjoy free lunch and drinks cinema and tv etc.India is duty bound to protect life of its citizens and is a legal process. Doesnt Jayalalitha and karunanidhi get security. Even you are entitled if  constitutional authorities percieve threat to your life. For your information, Ramdev pays taxes in many crores, Subramanian Swamy brought out how your tamilian gods sold 2 lakhs crores worth 2g sprectrum for free and pocketed the amount into their bank accounts  and corruption trails. All you can do is only hate them.You want to assume that all govt money is yours. I didnt know that tamilians take pride in being lazy and getting freebies. Be a beggar for life and keep waiting for every election for some bones.</comment>

<comment>Y is that, reservation is still in place.</comment>

<comment>m0ron, biharis do very well in IIT entrance exam</comment>

<comment>Did I say they dont do well, J1CkA$$??</comment>

<comment>u were talking about their entrance through reservation, a**h</comment>

<comment>U mean none of the biharis join IIT thru reservation, u piece of shitt</comment>

<comment>How about the poor Indians who don't have reservation?</comment>

<comment>show me a bank that declines education loan if u manage to get a seat in IIT</comment>

<comment>Oh, no banks deny loan. So you will hike the fee to 500% too?</comment>

<comment>Banks do deny loan, guess wat the IITs and IIMs fee hike are hiked by more than 500% since their inception, it isnt same as they started with. Packages are also getting bigger. But the fee hike wont be sudden.</comment>

<comment>Providing quality education to the people at the "LOWEST POSSIBLE COST" is the responsibility of any government elected by people.Now, Modi sarkar is attempting to make education as the right only for his friends Ambani and Adani.</comment>

<comment>Fee hike is definitely not good new for students, but previous governments have successively hiked the fee. Still IITs are facing paucity of funds.</comment>

<comment>point is about tuition fees and decided by a rank uneducated dumbo like yale irani</comment>

<comment>The point was not being able to afford it</comment>

<comment>People do not remember Nitish was just a BJP man as late as a year and half back ?</comment>

<comment>It wasn't Nitish. It was Mr.Jaswant Singh. You need to improve your knowledge.</comment>

<comment>no, it was bjp which was piggy backing on nitish's shoulder not the other way round</comment>

<comment>Bihar is going to the starting of the downfall of BJP. BJP will not win even a single assembly election before LS 2019 election</comment>

<comment>If wishes were horses, beggars would ride!!</comment>

<comment>they needed to be routed all over india if shah-modi combine are their heads</comment>

<comment>Simple - who would you trust to lead Bihar? Nitish or some m0ron like Sushil Modi/Chirag Paswan/Manjhi.</comment>

<comment>It is constitutionally possible for PM Modi to rule Bihar as CM. Bihar BJP has no leader the lead the great nationalist party of Bihar that is BJP. what a shame?</comment>

<comment>All these polls are just good enough to get some publicity. Ground situation in Bihar is not so straight forward.- It is incongruous to see Nitish and Lalu together - That surely is going to change lots of voters- This beef violence and fringe BJP elements are defnitely going to consolidate anti-BJP votes towards UPA than the SP- Pappu and others.- Voters generally are smart and chose stablity over other things. UPA alliance will have to depend on three partners to stay in alliance. I am sure voters can see what lalu can do if the government will depend on his support. - It is easy to see benefits of same party ruling in Center and Bihar. So I feel BJP will win even if only a slender majority.</comment>

<comment>these surveys sound more realistic..</comment>

<comment>interesting battle. even more interestingly titled piece... i dont know if BJP ever said it was a walk in the park that they would get a rude wake up call now. Its clearly a battle of personalities in Bihar and hopefully topics like caste and religion are 'cast out' sooner than later. If it means, bihar votes for Nitish's development promise Vs NDAs thats win-win for democracy.</comment>

<comment>Even though I dont like Modi, I hope he wins........to rub against congress wounds. Congress has to sit and think why it the most lazy and lethargic party which has spoiled our country's security.</comment>

<comment>if it was lazy why most of its policies are copied by present govt?</comment>

<comment>Lazy in "implementation" you fool !</comment>

<comment>Creating policies and implementing them are two different things. You won't get it!</comment>

<comment>A defeat for BJP in Bihar is a must, if don't want India turn into a Jungle Raj where Yogis,Sakshis,Sadhvis, Thogadias will roam like lions and threaten poor people</comment>

<comment>AK, Owaisi, Lalu, Nitish, Azam Khans are fine? And ofcourse RG</comment>

<comment>Agree</comment>

<comment>One survey of many projects a low number for BJP and the author latches onto it, doesn't even see a need to mention other numbers. I don't care who wins BJP+ or NDU+ but these biased "reporters" are a nuisance.</comment>

<comment>These biased reporters are not only nuisances but also manace..First Post is a forum any tom,dick or harry becomes a journalist</comment>

<comment>Modi administration is a total failure. He has  helped his barbarian gang to roam freely in India. He converted  India into a Jungle Raj where any extremist can go and kill anybody. Now he is talking about jungle raj in Bihar</comment>

<comment>Really? You deserve AK, Congress and Owaisi and ofcourse Lalu</comment>

<comment>Nothing wrong with them except Owaisi. They are politicians in their own right and can do course corrections of their policies. No blanket rule to support bjp blindly against all other parties. That is dictatorship.</comment>

<comment>No wonder India is in mess!!</comment>

<comment>How are you still alive ? Are you typing from abroad ?</comment>

<comment>If Modi go on winning, life will be in danger for many. In a span of 16 months, many intellectuals had been murdered, a poor man had been murdered for eating some meat in the privacy of his home. The yogis,sakshis,sadhvis roaming freely in country side and threatening people. Is this not Jungle Raj?</comment>

<comment>Kaka- Dabholkar was killed in 2013, when congress was in state and center. Muzaffarngar happened when 100s of people died, it was congress and SP then....Check some facts before speaking anything. Don't become blind Bhakts of media.</comment>

<comment>Facts hardly matter to these stinkers..</comment>

<comment>At that time those murderers had at least some fear, but now Modi and his Sanghi Parivar  in rule, these barbarians have nothing to fear. So a Win for BJP in Bihar is dangerous for the country. More & More intellectuals will be killed, more and more poor people will be killed.</comment>

<comment>Just because BJP is shown in backfoot in opinions polls yesterday, so many articles have sprung up on what bjp needs to do. Shows a section of the media hides behind hindutva.</comment>

<comment>NAMOJI  is right person for all of india , and hope BJP will win election in bihar , its best for INDIA . see how true colors of CHINA < NEPAL < ISLAMABAD  showing up.</comment>

<comment>If Biharis make wrong choice and elects mahagathbandhan it speaks about their low intelligence leval and they have no right to flock to NDA ruled ststes for job</comment>

<comment>You didnt say anything about their intelligence level when the same people voted for feku and the Bharatiya jumla party in 2014 general election.... LOL...</comment>

<comment>Will you divide India based on NDA - ? Just like India Pakistan ??- Shame on you !!</comment>

<comment>Modi Dhokla bhai visit to USA was just to cement his personality cult ,US will have a nuclear deal with Islamabad-Nepal will go with a begging bowl to China and all he has to show are his crisp kurtas.</comment>

<comment>US will have a nuclear deal with Islamabad - Nepal? Let me guess where you took your education.</comment>

<comment>Raj and Uddhav are disgrace to Bal Thakre !!</comment>

<comment>Modi created a "Modi Mood" in USA with the help of event managers and asked the certificate for his performance of 16 months and every body gave him 100%. Most of the Modi votaries there are Americans not Indians. Why he is not asking about his performance to Biharis, to Gujaratis etc. ? Modi is a pathetic failure in every field except talking & drama.,This Bihar election is going to be the beginning  of his downfall</comment>

<comment>I am a Gujarati. Will you listen to what I have to say?</comment>

<comment>his foreign policy is nothing but foreign vacation. even his friendship with China was a hype.</comment>

<comment>Deb or Dumb?</comment>

<comment>can u explain it further...modi was in foreighn lands only for 56 days, the minutes of all the meetings agenda are available for every one to see..in betwee rahul gandhi was in foreighn land fr 65 days wer was he what was his agenda ........</comment>

<comment>Who is Rahul Gandhi again? When you hold up someone for comparison, say Mukesh Ambani (who is the scion of a famous Business family) or Vishal Sikka, (who is a professional, not an entrepreneur), would you compare them with other CEOs or with say Siddharth Mallya (famous for being Vijay Mallya's son) ?</comment>

<comment>Yes but Doval is the smart one here- he knows what he is doing unlike his predecessors</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal is enjoying Ghulam Ali concert with his jehadi friends,shame on that impotent,crass,abominable creature.</comment>

<comment>Both Nitish & Laloo have cheated people of Bihar in last 25 years by digging grave for people of state. Both destroyed Bihar by giving corrupt & bad governance. RJD, JD(U) should not be voted in any circumstances since both will bring JUNGLE RAJ -2 in state. Both parties are responsible for present severe drought conditions in state since all development funds are looted by corrupt politicians in last 25 years.</comment>

<comment>whatever be the prediction anti minority agenda should be stopped first before getting in to governance . Party ruling at the center should take all section of people with him.</comment>

<comment>Is centre responsible for every single hindu muslim fight ??..what they respective state government is doing ?..In last 10 years there is no hindu muslim fight ??</comment>

<comment>1) I think (and desperately hope) that BJP wins Bihar. A BJP win is needed for Bihar, more than for India or BJP. Not that BJP winning Bihar will transform Bihar into the next Germany or Japan in 100 days, the delivery of governance will be through the same Biharis, but it would be definitely better than what Laloo ji would provide. Nitish ji used to be brilliant at one time, around the early 1800s. His schemes cycles for students in secondary or higher secondary were both very practical and on budget. However, for the past few hundred years (or at least feels like that) Nitish ji seems to have let PM Modi ji totally overshadow his own being. Nitish ji can barely construct a sentence without Modi ji in it. He seems to be obsessed with Modi and that is not a good thing for anybody, least of all a CM candidate. 2) I don't think the Bihar elections are a referendum on the BJP's politics. It would be difficult to engage the residents of say the Kosi flood plains, about the potential threat to privacy if BJP becomes more powerful. I believe those people have more immediate concerns. The BJP has a golden opportunity to once again build India as a modern, secular country. Hope they don't mess it up with their focus on Beef Ban and Hindutva. If they focus on governance they would get another chance to rule and keep Congress away. If they continue with their competitive communalism, which some BJP / assorted sangh lovers term, Hindu pride and glory, they will give rise to competition from AIMM from the Muslims side and assorted hardline Hindutva parties, like the Rashtriya Seva Dal (earlier Hindu Seva Dal) from the Hindu side. India won't benefit, assorted bigots will get their spot in the light after a long time.Once people are tired of violence, communalism and the initial euphoria wears away, parties like Congress / NCP / SP etc. would be left standing...</comment>

<comment>according to the cnn ibn survey a good percentage of people were impressed by cm niteesh kumar,s perfomance what is this invisible perfomance one would like to know  zero power non existing health and education sector and zero law and order  this time again if the bihari once again invites  jungle raj and poverty by electing sickular kumar and chara chor then wholeof india will not forgive biharis nor will the other states take the burden of bihari migration anymore</comment>

<comment>Last year development agenda, this year beef agenda and what will be the agenda of next year? Carrot ban?</comment>

<comment>CONDOMS FOR MUSLIMS</comment>

<comment>I condemn your irresponsible statement.</comment>

<comment>At least corruption will be banned for 5 years !! No @G, CoalG, CWG !!</comment>

<comment>Yes corruption will be banned except Sushma, Raje, Shivraj, Munde and Gadkari. Correct?</comment>

<comment>Where is the  FIR against them ? forget conviction !!</comment>

<comment>Arnab Goswami is the best spokesperson that BJP ever had. Oh, God, he totally surrendered himself to Modi ji.</comment>

<comment>Wrong !! he is not BJP spokesperson, he is head of legilature, executive and Judiciary of India !!</comment>

<comment>Not at all. I have seen him bashing Sonia, Rahul, Laloo, Mulayam, Nitish , Kejriwal and etc. But, I never saw him bashing Modi atleast on one instance.Is Modi the perfect politician in this country?</comment>

<comment>1. I have never seen him interviewing Kejri,Sonia, Nitish2. Rahul, Mulayam Lalu deserves bashing. Rahul is third class3. Modi is too smart for Arnab or any interviewer. 10 years of continuous media attacks have made him even smarter..</comment>

<comment>I saw him interviewing Kejriwal before Delhi elections when AAP made a debut. Interview doesn't mean bashing.Then same Goswai kept shouting where is Manmohan Sigh, where is Manmohan Sigh atleast for the last 3 years of his rule. The whole country is turned out to be a terror state by beef. But, he never demanded Modi's view.He should have been paid a huge amout that you and me can't imagine.</comment>

<comment>The state that you are talking is governed by Mulla- yam and riots are happening since 2013.. He is not able to control !!</comment>

<comment>Only idiots are demanding Modi's view.... Everyone knows what he's going to say.He's not going to justify lynching, is he ? I do not see a point in asking Modi's view.</comment>

<comment>yes its seems to be he is one of the  perfect no nonsense politician</comment>

<comment>If Goswami is the "Chief Bhakt", you would be the "Deputy Chief Bhakt".</comment>

<comment>Forget about these surveys. Bihar loves Nitish not Modi. This simple fact answers all the questions.</comment>

<comment>Bihar loves castes, that's the hard truth !!</comment>

<comment>So  are you ashamed of threaded Brahmins who divided this country in to 6000 castes?</comment>

<comment>Rice bag bother about slave trade of  Africans .</comment>

<comment>Yeah, US Dollar bag brother like Sundar Pichchai. You will convert your nationality if you are going to get more money.</comment>

<comment>More than Brahmins, it's hate Brahmins that is dividing India into castes !!</comment>

<comment>If Brahmins hadn't create castes, there wouldn't be anything called castes. Isn't it?</comment>

<comment>They were in Minority, how can they divide everyone ? It becomes easy to envy the more successful ones !!</comment>

<comment>ha ha ha. Are you saying that Caste system was created was created by Dalits?</comment>

<comment>It was created by all !! Brahmins were not even ruler, they are supposed to be poor and without political power. How can you do suh thing  without political power and wealth ??</comment>

<comment>Yeah, Dalits branded them as untouchables and wanted to be lowest of all. What kind of logic is this?</comment>

<comment>Those things untouchability and all were done during 1000 years of Muslim and British rule. Othrwise, chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka were shudras. You need to learn some history !!</comment>

<comment>if jaya joins with karuna ....will they trust her or see opportunism:p..</comment>

<comment>No necessity for them to join because Modi has no business in TN.</comment>

<comment>Classic Akshaya Mishra article....based on one of the innumerable surveys you come out with an "analysis" of "takeaways" in favour of Nitish (read anti BJP), only to conclude...that we shouldn't jump to conclusions.</comment>

<comment>Randiya Mishra, wants BJP to fail badly. She is basing her argument on weak surveys. What she does not talk about is the amount of bad will generated by Nitish and his joining his arch enemy of one time. Fu¢k YOU Mishra</comment>

<comment>Tiger ji, aren't you bored of abusing 24x7? There are many other good things available to try in this world.</comment>

<comment>If he stops abusing, there will be no stipend from the RSS/BJP/Modi.</comment>

<comment>According to CNN-IBN congress is winning 20 seats... I can only laugh on it..</comment>

<comment>I think, they have added all the seats congress had won in different opinion polls. Still I find it difficult to believe that congress will reach 20 !!</comment>

<comment>It is written on every wall of Bihar, but could not be seen by a few Rajya Sabha seat seeker editors and many (upper)caste-biased journalists and reporters ..... same thing happened in Delhi elections.... Winning over discredited Congress and badly divided opposition in states like Maharashtra or Haryana (though the dipping graph of Modi's popularity was evident there too) was easier for BJP, but wherever they have to face non-Congress opposition, story is consistently different ... Wait for a month! Bihar results might be shocking for many ...In a major way, Bihar election would be a referendum on the performance of Modi government at center. I guess, more the rallies Modi addresses, the BJP's graph would go dipper down ... Same thing happened in Delhi elections too...</comment>

<comment>Taking cue from  the Delhi people  ruing over voting for AK 420 and co ,  people of Bihar  are  wise enough  not to vote for the corrupt  Lallu Sonia Nitish combine.</comment>

<comment>Ha haa haaa! Earlier in Delhi it was "AK47" and "AK56", now in Bihar it is "AK420" ...</comment>

<comment>winning big in Uttarpradesh with no good recent history...........noone acheived that feet</comment>

<comment>Why same post again and again, will not make much difference ?</comment>

<comment>Both Nitish & Laloo have cheated people of Bihar in last 25 years by digging grave for people of state. Both destroyed Bihar by giving corrupt & bad governance. RJD, JD(U) should not be voted in any circumstances since both will bring JUNGLE RAJ -2 in state.</comment>

<comment>We cannot believe any survey predicting congress is winning 20 seats in Bihar. CNN-IBN predicted 20 seats for them. In reality congress will win 0 to 2 seats..</comment>

<comment>if bjp is in fr a landslide victory in bihar thn y 40+ rallies of namo? </comment>

<comment>if one has the confidance only then he wud venture into a rally .......a defeat may reduce his stature..why gandhis are not confidant enough to do extended rallies</comment>

<comment>Whoever wins, Bihar will never progress.</comment>

<comment>In fact, this time it's otherway...Whoever wins, Bihar will have some good politician in Power !!</comment>

<comment>nitish at maximum can win 70 seats, even if he wins he wud be controlled by laloo</comment>

<comment>Satta bazar predicted AAP win for delhi elections .....now they are predcting bjp win, baring Ambani's  cnn ibn, and leftist india today every one is predicting a bjp win.............opposition will shout big at issues like beef, it is NDA which needs to be careful in not going astray.......</comment>

<comment>They predicted bjp win ..only aftr post poll survey did they change thr bet</comment>

<comment>unfortunately they predicted bjp win in delhi also... so you can't believe them blindly</comment>

<comment>Even as per this survey If 22% yadavs, 10% muslims and 36% kurmis are voting for BJP then i can't see how BJP is losing....there is a split in MGB votes when BJP votes are solidly backing them......</comment>

<comment>it dalits are not voting for NDA even Mahnaji is not have impact...paswans have lot of rebels it seems...</comment>

<comment>Its going to be a win for BJP only! Modi has still 12 more meetings lined up. Satta Bazar predictions are always right.They have predicted a clear BJP win! No doubt about this. Bihar will not make a mistake this time or else it is going to cost them heavily. How lopsided the survey results are is very clear from the fact, when it says congress will win 20 seats!!!  By any stretch of imagination this can never happen for a party which is already Zero in Bihar. I totally dismiss this survey as misleading.</comment>

<comment>3 factors seems to help Nitish1. Yadavs know they will have a big slice of power under nitish group , and their lever will be subordinate to Brahmis/Rajputs etc. under NDA2. The lower casts are usually not  vocal in opinion polls and always are understated3. When a chief ministerial candidate has high popularity, that usually is enough to swing the mandate</comment>

<comment>Against Nitish: 1.Dalits are with NDA becuase of Ramvilas and Jitan Ram Manjhi.They are generally less vocals.2. In OBC, Koeri and other BCs are with BJP, except Kurmi and Yadavs because of Upendra Kushavaha.3. Kurmis/Yadavs are one of the most politically vocal castes in Bihar.4. In Bihar,popularity depends on caste, not on work !!</comment>

<comment>bjp has clearly has said that there wont be a upper caste cm , or a non bihari CM...same age old method of dividing hindus or ppl on caste lines wont work out this time</comment>

<comment>Laloo is a past master at the game!Yadavs had tasted power under him and most likely will go with him.These things work in Bihar</comment>

<comment>Gone are those days... Now, you will find a Yadav leader in every village !!</comment>

<comment>Sir, I'm a big fan of you!</comment>

<comment>If Congress is winning 20 seats (50% of seats) then I am President of United states</comment>

<comment>let us wait..........nithish needs kurmi and yadav consolidation.............but hw can rjd and jdu who were in odds with each other fr 20 years consolidate fr a unholy alliance......if yadavs, kurmis think intelligenly they wud come out of this caste trap....</comment>

<comment>Nitish is going to lose in Bihar due to corrupt & bad governance. He failed in fulfilling most of promises made to people like assured supply of electricity in all places including rural areas but he failed miserably. So people are fade up with liar politicians like Laloo & Nitish who have cheated people of Bihar in last 25 years. Congress, regional parties like RJD, JD(U), SP, NCP etc & smaller parties like HAM, LJP, RLSP etc are corrupt party which are ONE MAN SHOW & have no internal democracy which is run for dynasty. What has happened in 15 years RJD Jungle Raj is well known in Bihar. Nitish has connived with convicted criminal LALOO to bring JUNGLE RAJ -2 in state. The coming elections in Bihar is do or die situation for public in which survival of people are at stake. There is no change or progress all over state in last 60 years when basic facilities like education, medical facilities, drinking water, electricity, rural roads, irrigation facility in rural areas, unemployment, poverty elevation, backwardness are not removed in past Congress- RJD- JD(U) misgovernance. What people will get after voting to this trio of corrupts who devastated this country by promoting massive corruption, communalism, castism, regionalism, terrorism, creating rift among different communities ? The continuation of such situation will ruin Bihar if Congress, regional & smaller parties are not defeated in assembly elections since all these parties are ONE MAN show for running DYNASTY politics. Now people has only alternative left i.e BJP provided this party ensures corruption free good governance by selecting qualified, intelligent, capable & experienced candidates. There is hue & cry over selection of criminals as candidates by all parties.This is not acceptable to people of state who should defeat all such criminals in coming election who will provide corrupt & bad governance if voted to power as happened in past 68 years. The people must take full precaution while voting to criminals who must be defeated at all costs. Only honest, qualified, young (less than 60 years) candidates should be voted for good & efficient governance for peace & prosperity of Bihar. The past blunder of electing corrupt & non-performing parties should not be repeated again & again. THE VOTING TO TRIO ALLIANCE OF RJD - JD(U)- CONGRESS WILL AGAIN BRING COMPLETE JUNGLE RAJ - 2 IN BIHAR WHICH WILL SPREAD ANARCHY & TURMOIL ALL OVER STATE RESULTED IN FURTHER POVERTY & BACKWARDNESS. BJP should be voted to power with absolute majority but this party must perform as per people's desire & ensure speedy development. The Corruption must be curbed at all cost which major irritant in progress of Bihar.</comment>

<comment>cnn ibn , first post are all run by Ambanis..they are unhappy with modi as simple as that...................bjp has the edge, but has a strong alliance which has great man power to counter with.....</comment>

<comment>I have a few friends on FB steady supporters of BJP and almost fans of Modi. Nothing wrong. He is a strong PM. They chided and some abused me during the Delhi state polls where I predicted clear AAP win. They are unhappy now too when I say Bihar is NOT decided yet, and Nitish has equal chances to win, if not more, and I have given reasons in earlier posts. Now let us see. Do not say Casteism has won if Nitish wins. You are sure of BJP-NDA win now, so stick to it. If it happens, I will give FULL credits to Modi because just now as things are Mohan Bhagwat's reservation talk and Dadri lynching/ beef-politics are ensuring that Nitish is gaining ground among the backward castes, Yadavs, Muslims and also women. Whoever wins it will be a cliffhanger, but chances are more of Nitish just now. Things may change in next three weeks as Modi is doing some 44 rallies in a month, highest by ANY PM in independent India in a state election, which itself SHOWS where NDA is standing just now.</comment>

<comment>Trying to sound so logical.. then why are you lying about the Number of rallies.. also this is an election which has huge implications for national politics and PM's development agenda..because of RS seats... so is it any wonder he is trying his level best?? Full marks to him whatever the outcome</comment>

<comment>Yes, there are a total of 44 rallies in Bihar all together by PM for these elections, and the number so far announced is the highest by ANY PM in any state election. Arguments apart, this is the fact. Nothing wrong in he campaigning to win. Natural. Just saying that this shows the ground reality of NDA in Bihar.</comment>

<comment>from where you are quoting this figure, and ground reality is Nitish is hanging on the coattails of a fodder scam convict and the most corrupt party... when all crooks combine.. the other side also has to fight more</comment>

<comment>You almost convinced me until i read this "Nitish is gaining ground among the backward castes, Yadavs, Muslims and also women" because of beef-politics......if it was your assessment then i have to question your IQ......so you are saying Yadavs started loving Beef??</comment>

<comment>NO! I do NOT eat beef myself neither like it. The killing of people in the name of beef (not proven in Dadri) is disliked by lower castes, Muslims and women. And beef was ONE issue there. Yadavs are angry on the Mohan Bhagwat statement on reservation actually.</comment>

<comment>RJD tried hard to make it an issue but reservation statement politics peaked out way too early and now it fizzled out...now BJP turned the table and now voting will happen on beef statement of Lalu...</comment>

<comment>In a major way, Bihar election would be a referendum on the performance of Modi government at center. I guess, more the rallies Modi addresses, the BJP's graph would go dipper down ... Same thing happened in Delhi elections too...</comment>

<comment>I presume so. But Delhi and Bihar are different as well. Caste was not an issue in Delhi. However, Nitish is doing his campaign intelligently. My only criticism of him is that he has given too many seats to Laloo and Congress actually.</comment>

<comment>Most of the seats contested by RJD are tough seats, stonghold of BJP ... apart from social (caste-religion) factors, rich-poor division too is working in Bihar to some extant ... Bihar migrant votes in Delhi too indicated that ...</comment>

<comment>its a neck-neck contest. totally unpredictable</comment>

<comment>That is what we were told about Delhi too ...</comment>

<comment>leave delhi. thats past</comment>

<comment>Water has further flown-down in the Ganges since then ...</comment>

<comment>Can understand your feelings.. BUt please don't exagerate numbers Number of rallys must be close to 25, not 44.Still it won't be no where near the effort a chief minister gave to win a university election..</comment>

<comment>You are wrong,,, desperate Modi to address, as scheduled, 44 - 45 rallies till the end of elections ...</comment>

<comment>AAP is nowhere in bihar. Mr Prof.</comment>

<comment>It does not have to be. My reference is of Delhi, if you lack language comprehension. AAP will be an issue to reckon with when Punjab polls come in. See whats written.</comment>

<comment>Heard the organization got split it Punjab..</comment>

<comment>Heard that some leaders were suspended from the party, and they are individuals without any alternative party. Whatever images are coming from media, more than 30 rallies with a lac or more participants have been organized by AAP across Punjab so far. I have my own criticisms about one man show of Kejriwal, but surely given the extremely shoddy performance of Akalis, divided house of Congress, not much base of BJP in Punjab, AAP is surely gaining ground.</comment>

<comment>If 2 of the 4 MPs are just some leaders, then its ok. The news is they formed some new outfit like Yogendra Yadav and Prasanth Bhushan. If this is how a so called party with principle functions from the very beginning, then it is difficult to see any results.</comment>

<comment>and disbanded in Mah :)</comment>

<comment>mayank gandhi remarked that leaders r doing gutter politics</comment>

<comment>blind bhakts of every party cant face the reality. prof is no exception :)</comment>

<comment>i can understand how a blind bhakt of any party reacts when faced with reality. there is no exception for BJP, AAP or fake gandhis</comment>

<comment>sir, dont think im bhakt. but AAP has lost its credibility by certifying a charachor like laloo in bihar. and as far as punjab is concerned, its a distant dream for AAP as AAP is disintegrating in punjab</comment>

<comment>Modi is high performer. Whatever he does, he has so much high energy level that others PM did not have !!</comment>

<comment>No doubts about that. And he has taken the stock of India higher. And online and offline communalists are bringing that DOWN by talking non sense of beef, love jihad, ghar wapsi, etc, and NOT focusing on Digital and Swachh India movements, etc.</comment>

<comment>If we can accept nonsense like Lalu, Mull-yam and Owaisi, surely these frige can be accepted !!</comment>

<comment>Well, it's a diverse country. Different people have different area of interests.. Will take time to improve mentality. Until then - accept the diversity !!</comment>

<comment>In the process such regressive things of Hindutva extremists will make the BJP govt lose its steam above. Delhi polls was a setback. Suppose there is a setback in Bihar, and Punjab is a much worse case already, there will be the downfall of the most powerful PM in 25 years. That is sad. Hope the idiots on ground, like Sangeet Som and Adityanath, understand this truth.</comment>

<comment>All RSS chiefs except one have been Brahmins. Bihari voters can see this reality.</comment>

<comment>If bihari voters check that much, ponder over and vote, people like lalu and pappu yadav never would have been in politics..</comment>

<comment>Except for 2, all others were/are Maharashtrian Brahmins.</comment>

<comment>But then you were saying only 25K people in delhi rally... keep changing stand as per requirement ??</comment>

<comment>So, you agree that BJP's defeat in Bihar would be defeat of Modi ...</comment>

<comment>Nice. The beginning of the end of Modi Raj. The dream, sorry nightmare, of a Hindu Rashtra should also be quickly buried now.</comment>

<comment>yeah who is this prestitutes to end about modi fate .. people willl decide ..btw congress winning 19-21 seats proves the reality of this poll</comment>

<comment>Sorry, dream on, for that reality of yours would only come true in an alternate dimension or in a galaxy far, far away. Your..er vision has an even slimmer chance of coming true before pappu gets elected as the pm and kejriwal as the president..feel free to dream on your visions, but don't expect it to become a reality, Ever..</comment>

<comment>LOL</comment>

<comment>Perform or perish is clear message</comment>

<comment>Finally, PM Modi has broken his silence on the infamous Dadri Lynching. Apart from repeating what president Pranab Mukherjee has said, Modiji also advised not to pay attention to leaders like Yogi Adityanath, Sadhvi, Sakshi maharaj, Sangeet som who play communal politics.Mind your words Modi ji, If Bihar electorate takes it seriously, Your votes will be in real trouble!</comment>

<comment>He did not repeat the President. Instead he said , Presidents thoughts is what is right for this situation. Now, the problem is how many of the people present in the audience has any idea what President thought, or who Pranab Mukerjee is. So, what will the audience do, they will ask there local part folks, and they will say Gau Mata killers will be killed. he..he.. People are easily manipulated. Both sides of the fence happy.</comment>

<comment>Dear voter friends in Bihar - Please remember - No vote for JD U, RJD, CONGRESS or any other party, this is one of the most odious and corrupt alliances, the jungle raj will be back in full if you vote for his jumla alliance. SO VOTE ONLY FOR BJP,.Remember, the only party that can uplift and help develop Bihar happens to be only the BJP. Even Modi Ji announced a massive aid for bihar and all that the egoistic nitish can do is carp about how much he has done.All of Bihar must ask themselves if they would be happy under another edition of Jungle raj and you will see that BJP is the only hope left for Bihar and to get it out of its backward stage to a well developed state. SO VOTE BJP, for development, thank you...</comment>

<comment>Aap ko to modi Ji ke sath hona chahiye....yaha kya kar rahe hai ..election bihar me hai</comment>

<comment>I dont agree with you congress will win 2-3 seats not zero</comment>

<comment>Remember voter friends in Bihar - DONT VOTE FOR BJP until the last paisa of the trillions of crores of stolen black money is brought back as promised by the BJP before elections. If some bogusmaster tells you it will take time, tell the crook your vote to BJP also will take time and that is after the last paisa is back. Remember it is YOUR money that was stolen by chors. And today the party is doing everything else other than bringing YOUR money back.</comment>
