<comment>good to note a competition of `nautanki' among kejri & pappu gandhi.....to remain in news...pappoooo made visit to the President.......</comment>

<comment>Ghidad ki maut aati hai to woh sehar ki taraf jata hai.....congress...pl wake up and get rid of nonsense leadership.....you must be having some logical thinkers within the party....don't you?</comment>

<comment>I read somewhere that Cong & RaGa have been reduced to indulge in university / collage level politics...what days have come for a political party of national level till yesteryear......shame shame......Cong need to understand...they are on the very same way lefti & communist are today.......just reduced to single digits...of no importance & relevance any more......</comment>

<comment>RSS believes in the concept of Akhand Bharat and hence their saffron flag represents the goddess/deity of an undivided India i.e. Bharat Mata. On the contrary Congi sycophants don't understand the logic behind the colour of the RSS flag. Instead of using 3 different colours in the tricolour to represent the religious distinctions in India, in the garb of diversity, RSS believes in the policy of One Nation, One people.The wholly saffron colour of their flag encompasses all the people of India, irrespective of the barriers of religion, class, caste and creed, language, etc. It is in fact a unifying aspect of the colour of their flag, not a divisive one and what's more, the saffron colour even advocates peace, not divisive violence. Since the RSS does not believe in the concept of the tricolor containing divisive colors, hence they do not hoist it.Their intention behind it is very noble, which unfortunately these sickular brainwashed people cannot comprehend and don't try to either. Yet the RSS has always shown the tricolor a lot of respect and has let its cadres hoist it at their homes or shakhas. Congis, commies and pseudo-seculars should do a bit of research. Period.</comment>

<comment>Yes. HE seems to rack up irrelevant issues with a view to disrupt parliamentary proceedings. We have seen during the last 2 Sessions when such issues were raised and important Legislations were stopped. People are taking a cognizance of such tactics. The Party he has inherited is so power hungry that it can handshake with anyone and everyone.</comment>

<comment>One thing which very clearly stands out in the whole JNU brouhaha is, Rahul Gandhi has no clue whatsoever. In Delhi the older Hindu generation (those who came during partition from West Punjab -Pakistan and their sons and daughters) and a majority of Sikhs ( Akali connection as well as Sikh massacre in 1984 carried out by Congress) are with BJP. Delhi has spread out and the population of NCR - those who migrated from Bihar, UP, Odisha and West Bengal and Bangladesh - who are from the lower strata and are in juggi jhopries are with AAP.  Congress does  not have a fixed vote bank in Delhi. The same with Communists.  JNU's Left is left high and dry once it comes out of the JNU gates. But the JNU happenings have national implications. BJP in general will gain with the nationalist fervour.  Trying to convert it into a minority or backward or dalit issue will help the regional parties like SP, BSP and Trinamool.  TDP, TRS, AIADMK and even DMK have no stake whatsoever and do not care. So what is Rahul Gandhi trying to achieve by aligning with Left. Today's  India has grown out of the Left fascination. Many of the JNU Left students may vote only in JNU elections and may not have votes in Delhi. See what happened in Hyderabad. TRS played  safe by not taking sides in Rohit Vemula issue and swept  Hyderabad municipal elections. Congress lost its seats in Karnataka, MP and Telengana. Rahul Gandhi needs good advisors. he can be emotional but in that case he needs to take risks and stand in the battle front till the end. He cannot shoot and scoot.Going to the President and crying on his shoulders will only confirm that he is still a child.  He needs to grow and show to the people that he has substance. The way ahead is hard and rough. No shortcuts like visiting universities  and sitting with shelf expired political parties.</comment>

<comment>What do you expect from leader of a party which has digi, sibbal, khurshid as emissaries. They are creating new standards for low life behavior and pappu has to do something extraordinary to surpass their feats.</comment>

<comment>Everyone except BJP members are anti-national.</comment>

<comment>Bechara Pappu  !!! His dumbness has no limits. He looks good smiling in the company of his mother and mouth fully shut and displaying his white skin.We all have a weakness for the fair skin and thats why the nehru-naqli gandhi family has ruled and ruined this country for 60 years.</comment>

<comment>Reporter to Rahulji: What is an exit poll?Rahulji:  Poll after which we will be exiting permanently.  itna tho malum hona chahiye aapko.</comment>

<comment>upa2 banned DSU 2-3 YEAR AGO ,NOW CONGI  are making them hero ,what a crook is RAHUL</comment>

<comment>Pappu is helping Modi in making congress-mukt Bharath!!</comment>

<comment>rofl. True though!</comment>

<comment>Rahul has all capabilities to lead ISIS now</comment>

<comment>Yet, not capable enough to lead RSS?</comment>

<comment>Rahul Gandhi is a real-time scoundrel and a cheat.  He is always at the lowest point.  There is nothing to comment on him regarding the JNU matter.</comment>

<comment>Kujliwal is the best actor ever. Watch his super duper  film Fight against Corruption.  He has made Delhi totally free of corruption. Now he he is playing caste and minority politics after meeting Lalu.</comment>

<comment>Nair saab....You misunderstood him when he said he will make corruption free Delhi. Now corruption is free, anybody can do it. From thulla to MLA. This is power of aam admi.</comment>

<comment>Pappu ka blood mein brown sugar hai. Dimag mein busa.  Don't put him in jail in Herald scam. We want to see this entertainer giving speeches</comment>

<comment>For The first Time the so called Pappu's action seems to be taking over Feku in staying consistent to himself and to the nation.</comment>

<comment>Rahul behaves very strangely. He never loses an opportunity to gouge his nails into the real or imagined hurts of votebank groups, thereby ensuring that disaffection between groups remains thriving. He is accusing RSS for Rohiths death..he should be behind bars for propagating falsehood. Whom does he blame for dalit deaths in UPA rule? Under that fair face he is diabolical if he can mouth such lies. He complains that RSS is spreading its ideology....RSS has as much right as the Maoists, Christianists and Islamists in spreading their ideology, provided no side uses violence. Freedom of speech cannot be a one way street as was under fascist Congress rule.</comment>

<comment>how much falsehood did ur fekubhai propagate? if their was laws against such he wud be hanged</comment>

<comment>Votes ke vasthe kuch b karega...</comment>

<comment>it was actually fekubhai jumlawal who promised stars and moon for votes</comment>

<comment>Rahul will say that nobody can give me certificates on "hitting low". "Hitting low" is in my blood.</comment>

<comment>Lol...pura uske khandaan mein h</comment>

<comment>Rahul hit a low point when he publicly torn up a paper about something which was approved by his PM Manmohan Singh.  Now he is hitting new low point when he is opposing what was done by UPA government.  And that is hanging of Guru.  He is acting as the one who opposed the hanging of Guru and MMS went against his wish</comment>

<comment>But RAHUL cannot beat any BJP Ministers at HITTING-THE-LOW-GAME</comment>

<comment>Pappu is helping Modi in making congress-mukt Bharath a reality !!!</comment>

<comment>Rahul hitting low is reflected in congress tally hitting lowest in last election. It will go even low in next.</comment>

<comment>And very soon, #feku team broke all time lowest record by 3 of 70 in Delhi assembly. Hence snatched the trophy. Didn't let Congress remain at that position for long.</comment>

<comment>The lowest point has already been accomplished by Lord khujliwal who turned the capital city into a dustbin </comment>

<comment>He did...</comment>
