<comment>One more woman CM at the helm! She will give tough competition to Mamta Banerjee in lowering level of governance.</comment>

<comment>u r right. c will compete with yet another young snake Omar in valley in bringing down the level of politics to gutter level. They are first Islamists than anything else. Do no mistake...</comment>

<comment>Wrong tense -- "will" is future, she was already in gutter-politics competition with Abdullah family from weaning.</comment>

<comment>Wal, at 56 she's unlikely to be any worse than her nearly-80-years-old father as CM -- especially of a waste-candidate Quebecish state!</comment>

<comment>Mehbooba. .Mehbooba.Ooooooo..Muft mein kyon chudvathi..Muzzie se kyon chudvathi. ..Mein Aur tu....Ooooooo....Oooooo..</comment>

<comment>We should never have kicked out the British, at least in India they did not have hereditary tendencies. To think of this creature being in charge of a volatile state, we might as well invite the Pakistanis in without a fight. </comment>

<comment>Andrabi Afia speaking: It is anti Islam to have a breeding woman as CM. C sud breed muzzies at home instead of politics.</comment>

<comment>56-years-old woman can breed?</comment>

<comment>Of course c can.... History tells us that a 96 year old wife of Abraham gave birth to Isaac who laid the foundation of his Abrahamic dynasty for Jews n Christians alongwith Ibrahim, the progenitor of Islam, yet another offspring of a similar age by-product. Abraham himself might have been more than 96 or hundred year odd old.</comment>

<comment>"Ibrahim" is arabic for Abraham -- and Ismail (spiritual "father" of Islam) was his son by an Egyptian slave (Hagar) so arrogant that she turned her back on God after being allowed to name Him.  Gen 16 records about Ismail's birth (and Hagar's being allowed to name God), and last third of Gen 21 shows her turning her back on Him (she chose Egyptian -- think "little different than Hindu" -- bride for her son), which led later to Ismail's purported descendant mohamad worshipping Old Nick (as "allah" -- proof in Isaiah 14:14) with delusions of worshipping God.Abraham was 86 when Ishmael was born, and 100 when Isaac was born.  Sarah (who was 90 at the time) is the only recorded case of post-meno woman of age above 45 giving birth (Gen 19 to first two-thirds of 21).</comment>

<comment>Mehboobaji is an idea whose time has come. </comment>

<comment>Have to burst your bubble -- that idea came about 800 years ago in Delhi with Razia (reigned 1236-1240), but didn't prove to be popular with the misruling amirs (who had her deposed in favour of her waster half-brother Bahram, and then murdered her when she tried to oust Bahram)....</comment>

<comment>To breed muzzies in millions.</comment>

<comment>She is a women of steel...and will sort out the NC once and for all..... Good luck to her and the people of Kashmir</comment>

<comment>You misspelled it's steal not steel! </comment>

<comment>Mehbooba Mufti is good as the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir.</comment>

<comment>not like my darling Andrabi...</comment>

<comment>good if mehabooba becomes a CM.</comment>

<comment>You must use a really abyssmal standard for "good" -- but then in waste-candidate Quebecish (state is unviable without Delhi, as Quebec is without Ottawa -- but "separation" bogie gets raised oft; albeit in case of Quebec, no coyote*** waiting to pounce and devour)*** predatory animal of North America, somewhat smaller than wolf and without wolf's obligate-pack-mentality -- takes livestock just as readily as does wolf.  Apt comparison to Pornistan, which is waiting to do just that with Kashmir which it was unable to continue with B'desh post-1971.</comment>

<comment>y n how...?</comment>
