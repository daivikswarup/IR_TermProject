<comment>BJP has from before never told thier CM candidate.. Tell something new....you only answer what is asked? AAP is contesting who's the CM candidate</comment>

<comment>Why AK is fearing to contest from Punjab is because if the elected CM performs well (as Punjab is full fledge state unlike Delhi) without any hazzles then that person will be more mightier than AK...He personally don't want anyone else to be on par him...So he is not letting AAP contest from Punjab....Can any AAP supporter clarify this? </comment>

<comment>Delhi hamari, aab Punjab ki bari.</comment>

<comment>Heard AAP will not contest in Punjab</comment>

<comment>India dreamt that Modi will take political Sanyas and rejoin RSS.</comment>

<comment>Hahaha..AAP should contest in Punjab ...help khalisthan movement... Only AAP can do it</comment>

<comment>Thinking or Imagining/ fantasizing ???</comment>

<comment>Absolutely not...AK seems to be worried...why he is not showing interest Contesting...who's CM candidate</comment>

<comment>really Modi's achhe din are dwindling very fast. Imagine all the state elections one after another in 2016-17. One after another disaster waiting. But undaunted as he is, will have to go on giving the same long speech so strenuously, so much hawabazi,  and more painfully, down the line, realising that people are laughing at his back.</comment>

<comment>Yeah yeah I know...just curious to know who in Akela arvind party can be CM candidate in Punjab... Why AK is fearing to contest from Punjab is because if the elected CM performs well (as Punjab is full fledge state unlike Delhi) without any hazzles then that person will be more mightier than AK...He personally don't want anyone else to be on par him...So he is not letting AAP contest from Punjab...

<comment>ONE MAN IS FIGHTING FOR YOU......... One Man is fighting ALONE by putting his life on the line. His name is Arvind Kejriwal. Congress government bringing on income tax inquiries, investigating him in every way but he is fighting. DO YOU KNOW WHY HE IS DOING IT? ........  It is because your children will not have to serve under Vadra's children or Yeddyurappaâ€™s children one day.</comment>

<comment>why don't you change your DP to great man's face</comment>

<comment>I am Nalayak Modi</comment>

<comment>CONSIDER THESE FACTS... BJP has hidden all facts and truth of Modi... his criminal Gujarat cabinet, his killing of over 3,000 innocent citizens in Gujarat, lying about development in Gujarat in long 13 years when rampant corruption exists, lands are stolen from farmers and given to favored industralists, there is a shortage of water and electricity, his abandoning his wife Jasodaben in Rajosana village, crony capitalism, using Ambani and Adani helicopters for campaigns, hiding his poor oratory by coaching him scripted speeches, avoiding open debate with Kejriwal.... This is called a pig with lipstick. BJP and you chaumachas are making smoke and mirrors to sell cat's pee as Amrit to Indian people.</comment>

<comment>Go to the court Nalayak! prove it... These lies were spread in 2014 and rejected by people, so please shut up!</comment>

<comment>It will prove in people's court in 2019. It will be like 1977 all over again. (Hint... Janata Party)</comment>

<comment>This is sick, Kongress butchered  thousands of Sikhs by dragging them out of their homes and you just think it didn't happened.It seems that vote bank politics is what your kind do..Kongress and its follower are disgusting and inhumane.</comment>

<comment>NARENDRA MODI........ Overweight, Overrated, Communal, Bad Orator, Poor English, Failed to Protect Citizens Under Leadership, Bad at Human Rights, Serial Liar, Darpok Leader of a Darpok State, 16 Years as CM but Corruption Exists in Gujarat, Wife Abandoner, Cult Worshiper, Needs Chaumachas and Handlers........

<comment>You are Rahul Gandhi of India??</comment>

<comment>Your opinion right ?</comment>

<comment>This is what Indian people are thinking now. Only 3 exceptions - Amit Shah, Modi and you.</comment>

<comment>6 consecutive posts 523 crore set aside for paltu's publicity are not getting wasted.!!</comment>

<comment>A SELF MADE MAN........  THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF MODESTY OF ARVIND KEJRIWAL..............Born in a middle-class home in a small town in Haryana, Arvind Kejriwal had studied diligently at school, and then passed one of the most fiercely competitive examinations in the world. Having graduated from an Indian Institute of Technology, a lucrative job in the corporate sector was his for the asking. He turned his back on the likes of Goldman Sachs and Hindustan Lever, and instead appeared for a public examination that equalled the IIT joint entrance in its competitiveness. This was the civil services test, where too he succeeded. This time, he took the job, but, after a decade, gave up the security and status that a Class I post in the Central government provides for the uncertain life of a social activist.As a student, Arvind Kejriwal had created his own chances and seized them. Rahul Gandhi, on the other hand, had been granted opportunities by his family background, and yet thrown them away. The pattern continued into later life. Kejriwal ran an NGO that directly addressed the problems of the poorer citizens of Delhi. His grassroots work won him a Magsaysay Award. His credibility established, he then threw himself into two wider campaigns, to bring about a right to information bill and to have the government appoint an anti-corruption ombudsman or lokpal.</comment>

<comment>BORN WITH A SILVER SPOON........  THE FAILURES AND DUMBNESS OF RAHUL GANDHI..............Rahul Gandhi's early trajectory was altogether different. He was born in the heart of Lutyens's Delhi, in the home of his grandmother, who was then the serving prime minister of India. When he was ready to go to university his own father was prime minister. He got admission to Delhi's most prestigious college, St. Stephen's, not principally on the basis of his high school grades, but via a certificate of his apparent skills in rifle-shooting. After a year, he dropped out of St. Stephen's, but was then admitted - again, through some amount of sifarish - in one of the world's top-ranking universities, Harvard. But he dropped out of this place, too, eventually graduating from Rollins College in Florida.While Arvind Kejriwal started an organization from scratch, Rahul Gandhi entered one that was more than a hundred years old and in which his mother occupied the powerful post of president (as his father, grandmother, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather had done before her). From the time he joined he was regarded as the second most important person in the Congress. Yet he refused to own up to the responsibility that is presumed to come with power. He rarely made speeches in Parliament, declined to serve in the cabinet, and campaigned indifferently and ineffectively in state elections.</comment>

<comment>OPEN CHALLENGE........ A TV DEBATE OF RAHUL, MODI AND KEJRIWAL......... WE WANT RAHUL, MODI AND KEJRIWAL DEBATE ON TV! ........ Narendra Modi is prone to gaffes when he is off the script. He calls Mahatma Gandhi as Mohanlal and sends Shahid Bhagat Singh to Andaman prison. When Modi is off the script, he does not know what to say or how to answer a question. Donâ€™t believe me? Just watch his interview with Karan Thaper on YouTube. Dumbo Rahul says India is a larger land than the United States and Gujarat is bigger than the U.K.  Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi are pigs with lipstick sold by their handlers. We want an unscripted 3-way TV debate in English or Hindi among Rahul Gandhi, Narendra Modi and Arvind Kejriwal......... Let Indian people find out who the real deal is........ Congress and BJP, IF you are your Mei Ka Lal, ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE!</comment>

<comment>KEJRIWAL IS THE NEW HERO OF INDIA..............This has not just served to fetch riveting media attention but also to project an image of a leader in the Gandhian mold. His attackers are now contrite devotees. It would be a mistake to see this just as tactical savvy. Rahul Gandhi will remain as a laughing stock while Modi will fade very quickly. Kejriwal will adoringly claim his place in history of India.</comment>

<comment>YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE NEXT GANDHI..............Kejriwal set out to launch a new kind of party and politics, one that cares for the people and empathizes with them. In this, he is succeeding. His conduct offers sharp contrast to a paradigm of insult and revenge championed by others, even if no one imagined that Kejriwal would be heralding such a redefinition of a politician's touchy-feely relationship with the people.</comment>

<comment>ARVIND KEJRIWAL IS ELLIOTT NESS OF INDIA..............ARVIND KEJRIWAL........ A Self-Shining Common Man......... Logical, Reasonable, Sensible, Simple, Modest, Honest, Humble, Slim, Educated, Patient, Good Listening Skills, Compassionate and Well Composed......... Kejriwal Needs No Chaumachas or Handlers and........ He is Like the Elliott Ness of India.</comment>
