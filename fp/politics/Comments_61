<comment>A perfect output from a kindergartener! How easy it is to write articles without reference to history. Proof reading is not part of this writer's forte. He jumped between 1947 and 2008 without reference to periods prior to 1947 or the interim period. Also maintains that nationalism will shake the foundation of national integration and national security.Does he know the meaning of oxymoron?</comment>

<comment>President of India, Supreme court Judges Election commission , let me judge you. Nuremburg trial said to Nazis, why did you not commit suicide, when they took the defense that they were just doing their duty.I say soul of post 1947 India is murder of INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS of  merit by reservation policy + and murder of property rights by socialism. Anyone volunteering to commit suicide as they are serving a fake democracy and an ocholocracy [mob rule]?  Just voting does not make a democracy - protection of Individual rights [the smallest minority rights]makes a country democratic and free..</comment>

<comment>If BJP asks for tri color on campus all the so called patriots from sickular media should support it rather that opposing it.   We all know lefties support communist countries even if they kill people like tianmen square because communism is more important than India to them. Congees want dynasty as the Kings here some more parties who support the lefties are one family parties. Part of the media who are lefties both. Socialist or communists fall in this category.  Any thing they write will be looking to deride BJP as India is ruled now by BJP.  They font care that India brought Modi because we were tired of the loot and hypocrisy of political parties and tired of these politicians with left ideologies.  They are strong with media muscles with a lot of bootlickers in it. A national flag is a questionable commodity for them as it may instill patriotism to Indians rather than becoming bootlickers of a family and to a rotten ideology of the left We need to wake up from this and keep these crooks at bay </comment>

<comment>The writer has seen the scenario with one eye open only and justify his hidden RSS hatred!</comment>

<comment>What is more important than his being Anti national is Kanhiyah is not an Individual [rather he is ANTI INDIVIDUAL] - he is a CPI worker, who was powerful enough to Impose emergency along with Indira Gandhi. He will protest Afzal Guru execuation but he will not say a word on murder of merit an Indiviudual right. Rather he wants people themselves to murder Individual rights so that he can impose his single party collective dictatorship=================================================================================Rohit Vemula was also a goon who assaulted ABVP person. They are from the ruling gang [as subset of population]. They are pro-reservation. Perhaps Rohit vemula recognized the emptiness of his life and committed suicide.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------When a person scores above 94% and another gets same seat for 49% in an EXAMINATION when the examiners dont know the examinees then merit does not exist because it has been murdered. A person who was murdered did exist. So also merit.That is the argument of relative morality of Mixed economy, a fascist economy - because measure and morals is a product of ones upbringing they dont exist. What is only moral is what the Constitution and mafia politicians laws state.Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim’s gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of money taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials and mafia politicians.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, but that it cannot be used honestly.Why does not the state allot a seat strictly on merit and snatch it away OPENLY?</comment>

<comment>RSS are cheapstakes that would stoop to any level of treachery for their gains. The same RSS fought court cases against two citizens for hoisting National tricolor for 12 long years!!!.</comment>

<comment>This article is stupid, RSS isn't dividing the country, when the recent flooding happened they helped all religions and castes. This article like Congressy leftys and Barkha, Sagrika and other anti-Indians and anti-Hindus are scared of RSS because they will kill off the sectarian Congress. The internet is exposing the truth, they can't hide behind just NDTV anymore. They know their time is limited and are trying anything to get limelight, even in Kerala they are sick of Congress and are moving to BJP in droves.</comment>

<comment>I will organize Roman style duel or.... fight to end between 2 Hindu slaves called Nitin Gadkari and Amit Shah in the Mughul Colosseum next Wednesday.... This will be a public holiday for all except for Hindu slaves. The Hindu gladiator slaves will fight until the Hindu cows will come home. The surviving gladiator will get to spend time with the short and dark slave belly dancer Sadhavi Prachi…. Who will dance in bhagwa RSS chaddi and serve stinking Gomutra to all..... Alcohol is prohibited in Islam ..</comment>

<comment>U have such filthy dreamz Emperor Gobur. </comment>

<comment>Wow how shameless can u get David Devdas? Ur article is ridiculously stupid. U speak the same lines as India hating Pak sponsored Islamic terrorists. R u their paid callboy or r u a terrorist urself?</comment>

<comment>I find this article completely ridiculous. The Congresis and Commies have played vicious tricks on the nation. They are the ones who used the divisive and anti-national policies like minority appeasement, casteist policies, violent trade unionism and supporting India's enemies like support for China in 1962. The list goes on. The commies were like the pampered dogs of Congress and they were rewarded through institutions like JNU. With the loss of power and potential loss of privileges, these rogues are using their well-entrenched bastions like the press which has been reduced to yellow journalism. How dare these traitors tell us about how things are bad now and heading for worse? They are just indulging in muck-raking and raising phony issues?</comment>

<comment>The author has mischievous intent. Not a single word about displaced kashmiri brahmins. Tricolor is symbol of respect to motherland.  What happened in JNU was betrayal and assault on our motherland. Will the author allow his mother to be assaulted in open and allow it under freedom of expression? </comment>

<comment>What nonsense, Tricolor is for uniting all Indians and each Indian should have pride in it. It is not an issue of debate or discussion. Discussing love for nation is like debating whether one should respect his mother or not.</comment>

<comment>FIRSTPOST is vertually became mouthpiece of anti India elements.</comment>

<comment>Its a mouthpiece for Muslim extremists. Here in the UK they shut down any Islamist element with very hard fists. India needs to do the same, set an example that if they want to commit treason, there is a big cost.</comment>

<comment>Why is our national flag a divisive issue? The writer is all f*ck#d up.</comment>

<comment>exactly</comment>

<comment>What a warped viewpoint! The ones hoisting the national flag are divisive and ones hoisting the Isis flag are poor persecuted victims. The ravings of this journalistic cabal are harming the country. The RSS is much less communal and much les  intolerant than the church, and atleast doesn't support child rapists like the Vatican does.</comment>

<comment>RSS ma der cho do ki organization hai</comment>

<comment>This site is full of anti national supporting writers who want Indian flags to lie low .    Are  these Indians ? </comment>

<comment>Only country where love of national flag is termed anti-national by seculars</comment>

<comment>Only dimwits like you support organization like RSS who fought court battle against citizens for hoisting National flag in the country!! 12 year fight against hoisting National flag. Get a life moron.</comment>

<comment>The national flag is designed by the seculars and the seculars had sacrificed their life for the tricolor during the independence struggle when RSS and Hindu Mahasabha were saluting the Union Jack.</comment>

<comment>Your view on history is distorted, there were thousands of pro RSS and Hindu organisations that wanted independence without the cost of creating Pakistan. But KHangress just couldnt helped themselves and give Pakistan land.</comment>

<comment>Name a single RSS person who participated in the independence struggle.</comment>

<comment>Then welcome it friend rather than opposing it.  </comment>

<comment>How Come JNU Debate has now become HINDUS V/s MUSLIMS because of RSS. Shame on u Firstpost. Stop Spreading Hatred for godsake.</comment>

<comment>All Indian political  debates ultmately and logically ends up in Hindu Muslim and communal or caste politics.This is our goon journalism of our intellectual media and practiced by  anchors.There is direct understanding between journalists and politicians like what Arnab puts it there is direct understanding between police and lawyers. Amusing debate we are watching in Times Now now. This single incidence rarest ot rare nature will not bring shame to lawyer community.</comment>
