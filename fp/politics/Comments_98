<comment>Instead of wasting productive time shouldn't these idiots spread awareness about health issues in India. The priority of this Bhagwa brigade has always been Hindutva and hate politics. Exposed Much?</comment>

<comment>I dont know why these buffoons dont take other more important issues for the country!</comment>

<comment>Why is the Buffoon Subramaniam Swamy rooting for an alliance with the DMK ostensibly with the consent of Central BJPee leaders when he was instrumental in framing of chargesheet against the accused belonging to the Patriarch family members in the 2G scam ?  How is that that the graft  taint evaporates with the BJPee aligning with the DMK ? Are we now to assume that the 2G scam over which the BJPee raised hue and cry of being gigantic  has less relevance ??</comment>

<comment>This has a broader ploy. DMK is on a relatively solid footing due to the mishandling of floods by ADMK government. Now I am sure you would have known about the differences between Alagiri and Stalin. Swamy is trying to sell Stalin as a CM candidate with the carrot of DMDK & BJP alliance. Now this is going to incite Alagiri and might result in a weakening of DMK party in the southern centers.  And thus strengthening ADMK and allies.My belief is that the agreement between BJP and ADMK during the assets case against Jayalalitha would still be implemented unless BJP pulls out of it or BJP manages to get DMDK as a alliance partner.Ground situation is tricky. ADMK is in a very weakened position in the state especially in the northern centers. There is a general feeling of optimism in the DMK camp. The third front comprising Vaiko & the Left has some pockets of influence. PMK which is a caste based party in the north belt, is very weak. They might be able to influence if they cobble a alliance with BJP and DMDK. DMDK is still weighing the options trying to see where the bucks are. If DMDK goes alone or joins the third front camp without BJP, with lot of work on the ground they can reasonably expect to form the government.The feeling amongst the people is a general sense of despondency towards both the dravidian parties. BJP has shot itself in the foot with incidents in IIT-Chennai & Hyderabad University. The tacit incitement in the kongu belt has not made them dear to anyone in that region. Lets see how it pans out.</comment>

<comment>Good analysis of the ground situation !!</comment>

<comment>A piece containing too many ifs and buts can not be called a good analysis.</comment>

<comment>Circumspection is another name of indecisiveness. If you are on the ground, you should have the capability to gauge the mood far more accurately.</comment>

<comment>Madam, all those issues can be addressed.Regarding integrity, I agree. But understand we are not asking for Macca to be destroyed for Ram Temple.We are only asking for destroyed temple to be re-built.For sake of integrity we can not keep showing other cheek, otherwise, we will be so bruised that we will eventually have no cheeks left.Moral: Even Muslims have a stake in the integrity of India, not just hindus. So, a just cause like this should be agreed to by them as well!</comment>

<comment>Whenever BJP entrusts something to Swamy, you can be sure they expect maximum publicity, minimum credibility/plausibility. Look no further than Swamy's claims of Re/$ at Rs.35 to the $ within 2 yrs of NDA rule. Of course, we are near 70 now and no one is the wiser.</comment>

<comment>Swamiji - How will you convince yr daughter who has married a Muslim ?And what does yr Western lady whom you are blessed to have as your wife say about yr obsession and infatuation with this Temple ?</comment>

<comment>Utter hypocrisy - man who has turned his own house into united nations is fighting for ram mandir. Hey ram ghor kalyug</comment>

<comment>They support him on this. They are his family after all.</comment>

<comment>So Swamy will not be criticised like Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi for his hypocrisy by the Sanghis !! Ha ha !!When is VHP going to do a Ghar wapsi for Swamy's daughter ??</comment>

<comment>They were hypocrites not Swamy. His daughter is in her ghar. Why should there be a wapsi? Don't you know in India, after marriage, a girl's real ghar is the ghar of her in- laws?</comment>

<comment>Ha ha ha !!  Is she a Muslim or Hindu now since normally after marriage, it is the bride who will embrace the faith of the groom !!And what about the Westerner whom Swamy married ?  Wasn't this patriot able to find a Desi Bahu in a humungously populated country like India that he was forced to  seek  a marriage alliance with a foreigner !?Good that you showed yr extreme party loyalty and devotion by trying to defend the indefensible.  But it lacked conviction and instead of being a serious reply it ended up as a  bad joke !!</comment>

<comment>She is an Indian and what I said applied to all Indian girls. Marriage is a personal thing. It can not be restricted to territorial boundaries. It is stupid to say that one should marry only within one's country, or one's community or even religion.Swamy does not need me to defend him. He is capable enough to do it himself.</comment>

<comment>Well you are only parroting what we are saying. But the problem is that you have a myopic vision applying this logic when it is convenient to you !!</comment>

<comment>It is not a matter of convenience. I have always held these views on marriage. Parroting others may be your pastime not mine.</comment>

<comment>So do you have the gall to condemn the cheap stand of the Sangh here ? </comment>

<comment>I do not know what is the Sangh stand on this. I do not hold brief for them.</comment>

<comment>So  you are not aware of Sushma threatening to tonsure her head and sleep on the floor  if Sonia becomes the PM ?? Ha Ha Ha Ha !!The problem is that you think everybody countering you are idiots !!</comment>

<comment>Sushma is not Sangh. Moreover, she never said that Sonia should return to Italy. She was protesting against her becoming the PM as has been the case with Modi. Many people declared that Modi should not become the PM. Some of them even threatened to leave the country if he became PM. Did I say you are an idiot though your arguments sometimes border on idiocy.</comment>

<comment>Sushma is not Sangh ?  What it matters whether  she is in BJPee or its Mother outfit.  She is considered as part of the larger parivar as everybody knows that BJPee is just an offshoot and cahoot  of the RSS howsoever they try to conceal it feigning autonomy. And you had Uma Bharti too, who took a vow not to enter Parliament if Sonia became PM and there are other BJPee leaders as well as Sanghi leaders like Togadia, Singhal and of all  Feku himself who has chided her being a foreigner in many of their speeches implicitly as well as explicitly. Infact in the 2004 poll campaign, you had posters displaying whether they need a foreigner or a local as PM of this Country. So do not try to hide the pumpkin inside a loaf of rice as is your wont !!The issue is why and many others in the Sangh Parivar  protested against her becoming the PM ?  It was because she considered her a foreigner who was not fit to rule the Country.  Well, leaders will not say in public that Sonia should pack back to Italy, but the minions in the party as well  Chaddi supporters in various social network sites have been constantly berating on this line of her family returning back to Italy !!Feku's issue is different and I am not sure why you brought that here into this subject as it is diversionary. Nonetheless, as a CM, he was ignominiously  denied a visa on human rights violation by US and European Countries and so many in this Country including myself consider it as a shame and insult that he has managed to become a PM of this Country after overseeing the massacre of innocents. But in this lawless Country, you should always have the patience to expect the unexpected as subverting and manipulating the rule of law by  power and influence is a norm rather than an exception !!If you call me an idiot, I will be most gratified because there is no better conferment than to be chided in such a fashion by Chaddis because you know that you are talking sense which is always despised and detested by this ignoble tribe   !!</comment>

<comment>You can go on ranting about chsddhis and lungis or lingeries as long as you wish, I do not bother because I am not interested in this non sense.Yes, it is fact that some people were against Sonia becoming PM not because she was from another country but because she was not qualified to become one. She had no experience of governance and the complexities of a country as diverse as India. Again some people were against Modi becoming the PM though he was not suffering from those infirmities.Granting visa or denying visa is the sovereign right of country. There is no ignominy involved if someone is denied a visa. You are saying</comment>

<comment>Sonia was opposed only on grounds of being a foreigner and not because of lack of qualities or experience.  Even Sharad Pawar came out of the Congress citing the foreigner issue !!Modi was opposed visa on grounds of human rights violation. The ignominy involved is right here when you underline and bold "human rights violation" which doesnt behove of a CM or his character !!</comment>

<comment>I could not complete my earlier comment as I had to go to perform some chore. You are using words like ignominy etc in the context of visa because you do not know how the consular system of different countries works. A country may deny visa even to a perfect saint without assigning any reason. Modi was too denied visa but no reason was given for that. Also, do not forget that the same countries which denied him visa are now falling over each other to grant him the same. In fact they feel gratified if Modi visits those countries.You may have your own interpretation but the fact remains that Sonia was not qualified to become Pm because of her experience. Sharad Pawar's case was different because he himself was harbouring ambitions of becoming one and Sonia was standing in his way.</comment>

<comment>That was widely reported in the press that his visa was denied only  on  grounds of human rights violation. Even we had columns in First post as well as Rediff illustrating this aspect.  When there was a representation from Overseas BJPee to the US Authorities to reverse this decision, we had a delegation from India comprising of MPs who insisted on the US Authorities to stick to the decision and that is the reason Feku couldn't visit ant US or European country during his tenure as Gujarat CM and was forced to address video Conference to communicate with Gujjus settled in the States !!This rigid stand changed when he became the PM whereby these Countries found his sins being washed away once he attained the top position.  They realized that it is impractical and futile to oppose a PM and they had business and commercial.interests in India as well and so upholding moral probity became secondary !!It is not my interpretation, but the fact is that she was opposed primarily on such grounds and you also had a rumour being floated by the Sanghis that Abdul Kalam had rejected her candidature as PM due to Constitutional.constraints which of course was denied by a Rashtrapathi communique later which dismissed them just as rumours !!</comment>

<comment>It is fact that Modi was denied visa but it is also a fact that no reason was assigned for that. As I said earlier a sovereign country can deny visa to anybody wishing to enter that country and is not bound to disclose the reasons for the same.  Press just guessed why Modi was not given visa. It is also true that Congress touched a new low by sending a delegation to America to plead that Modi should be denied visa.About Sonia, you are projecting only Sharad Pawar;'s reason as the reason  for all others to oppose her becoming the PM. The BJP's objection primarily was her inexperience.People had heard the story  about the President rejecting her candidature but nobody believed that for the simple reason that the President has no such powers.</comment>

<comment>Feku was not an ordinary individual.  He was Head of a State and was ignominiously and notoriously the first CM or rather the first dignitary  in independent India to  be stripped of his visa thus bringing disrepute and discredit to the whole Country !!Well it was Sonia's foreign origin which was often cited by the Sangh  Parivar and many of the BJPee leaders stated unambiguously on record that it was a tragedy that the Congress couldn't find an Indian to lead this Country.  So no amount of trying to spin and deny the rather obvious is going to do credit to you either !!</comment>

<comment>Visa is nobody's right and hence there is no humiliation if someone is not given it. I, however, agree that Modi is an extra ordinary person with no match as a leader in the world today. it is stupid to impinge on a nation's sovereignty by linking grant of visa for any particular reason not disclosed. Modi's greatness lies in the fact that those very countries which refused him visa are now licking his feet and feel grateful if he obliges them with a visit. If any body has lost prestige and respect in the entire episode, it is those countries and their hypocrite leaders. Modi has proved to them how stupid they had been. Btw you do not seem to know the difference between the head of a state and the Head of a state government.The only objection to Sonia becoming PM, in so far as the BJP was concerned, was her inexperience and not the country of her birth. What leaders of other parties/organisations thought and said on that issue is irrelevant.</comment>

<comment>Then why u chaddis dont leave one chance to tell sonia gandhi to go bak to italy?</comment>

<comment>Lungis or chaddhis may have been talking to you about that. I never said that Sonia should go back to Italy.</comment>

<comment>So will you condemn the Chaddis for this preposterous stand ??</comment>

<comment>I do not know what is the Sangh stand on this but I have made my views very clear.</comment>

<comment>That is what the Theists will claim.  I will never become a victim of childish pranks performing oblations to idols, solemnizing marriages between idols by priests, waking up sleeping  Gods, decorating idols with jewels etc.  This really borders in absurdity for me and nauseating to say the least !!God ???? Ha ha ha ha !!  First the Theists have to come to a consensus on it.  They are the one who look terribly confused dealing with it  !!</comment>

<comment>How do u plan to marry cause even in court marriages u have to do that 7 fere stuff</comment>

<comment>Why ?  Registered marriages performed without customs and rituals are absolutely legal !!The problem is that the Theists have surreptitously included God and Religion in every sphere of social and cultural activity making it an inseparable part of life !!</comment>

<comment>well.. twitter will be more fun then</comment>

<comment>Swamy & RSS also need to expose the story of 6 year old baby Aisha who was raped by Pedo Mohammed. As per current laws, he would have been hung.</comment>

<comment>Even better, he should expose Brahma, who lusted after his own daughter and married her and produced children of incest!!</comment>

<comment>You moron - go first look at all the sexual abuse carried on by the Hindu gods....Krisha the boy eyed boy was a predator, molestor and a rapist </comment>

<comment>Idiot.Mohammed was a pedo and rapist.Women fell for Lord Krishna due to his good looks and he made the most of it and gave them pleasure.Spot the difference</comment>

<comment>ha ha unbelievable!! How funny it to watch people fighting over imaginary things and stories!! Get over religion and get a life!</comment>

<comment>First stop praying to Shiva's dick</comment>

<comment>Yeah sure...Krishna was a women abuser, even today young women are abused in his name called Krishna dasi...</comment>

<comment>LOL..Couldn't defend pedo anymore?</comment>

<comment>As I said worry about praying to Shiva's dick and then praying to Brahma who slept with his own daughter...no wonder sexual abuse is prevalent in Hinduism </comment>

<comment>bhaijaan apni sagi bahan ko chor dena at least...</comment>

<comment>Well I don't follow Hinduism so women around me are safe and not abused </comment>

<comment>So u r saying there are absolutely zero cases of abuse and rapes in western countries?YA RIGHT</comment>

<comment>really is this still happening in your house...poor u...</comment>

<comment>Happening in all temples....go and check</comment>

<comment>man u have got insane....it happened once upon a time and the practice died long time back...</comment>

<comment>You prefer to stick your head in the sand and pretend it does not exist. In North karnataka, Maharastra, Andhra, these women are "Goddess Yellama" worshipers or Devadasi's.... in karnataka alone more than 30,000 women are in this custom. </comment>

<comment>No no sadly it hasnt. Its outlawed but still practised. I saw this episode on bhagwan dasi's recently on crime patrol and the guy told the statistics and all that. I was surprised cause before that i didnt even know any such thing happnd</comment>

<comment>Yeah sure...ignorance is bliss</comment>

<comment>very true...yeah...a hindi serial is howing it on some channel...it is surviving there...</comment>

<comment>Lol...Brahma slept with his own daughter Sarawathi, so before you throw mud on others check your religion first </comment>

<comment>Never realised that pedo Mohammed, the rapist was a mythical figure....LOL</comment>

<comment>Time for you to go and pray to Shiva's dick LOl</comment>

<comment>Time for you to go and insert a carrot in your mom's pussy imagining it to be pedo's dick..LOL</comment>

<comment>I think the Ram Mandir is a good idea.  Because then we can move on from this topic on to other things. As long as this albatross hangs around our collective necks, we'll keep going back and forth.The other advantage to the Ram Mandir: it will bring lots of tourists to that area, improving the lives of the locals (who are mainly Muslim,n  money knows no religion). They can set up businesses to supply flowers, garlands, prasad, the usual tourist-trap accoutrements, etc.In the best possible scenario of my dreams: Muslim leaders will agree to build a Ram temple there, and will collect the funds necessary to build a top-class temple. In return, Hindu organizations will collect money and get a nice mosque built nearby, as a gift to the Muslims....</comment>

<comment>"We can then move on from this topic to other things"What is the guarantee that with the settlement of this Ram Temple issue amicably, the Sangh Parivar will not rake up Kashi and Mathura which are well in their agenda in the name of cultural resurrection and  have been put in the backburner for now ?What is really the need for Sangh Parivar to rake up this issue every now and then when the matter is sub judice ? Even its political wing, the BJPee which during the hey days of Mandir movement had opposed the jurisdiction of Courts to decide on matters of faith has today undertaken a U turn of that stand and now singing the secular tone obviously assured that the vexed issue has been milked to the maximum for its political upturn !!Why do we need a new Temple to improve tourism ? India with its ancient past has ample number of historical monuments and foot prints of an ancient civilization with their remnants to attract and promote tourism. Moreover, there are already thousands of Temples within the vicinity of Ayodhya and Faizabad in a dilapidated condition crying for refurbishing. Don't you think it would be prudent on any body's part to concentrate on their rejunevation !!What has really complicated this issue is the politicization of it by the Sangh Parivar which has used this issue as a incendiary tool for political mobilization and played havoc on this Country by in the name of faith  by completely destroying the social fabric and created distrust and mutual hostility and instilled a sense of insecurity  between communities. If not for the Sangh Parivar, there is every possibility that there could have been a negotiated settlement to the issue. Even the Hindu Mahasabha which is one of the litigants in this issue has blamed the Sangh Parivar for its cynical manipulation of this issue for petty political gains !!</comment>

<comment>''RSS will now train its volunteers and sympathisers so that they can check the alleged "disinformation campaign" on the social media''.Really ! are they going to check on themselves ?</comment>

<comment>bjp digging its own grave....such divisive politics will burn our nation....it is matter in the  court...let court decide</comment>

<comment>What is wrong with constructing a temple. If Hindus can not have a temple in Hindustan where will they? In Saudi Arabia?</comment>

<comment>There are already thousands of Ram Temple within the vicinity of Ayodhya and Faizabad claiming that Ram was exactly born in their place contradicting the other !?</comment>

<comment>That does not answer my query. There may be lakhs of temples why can not Hindus construct one more?</comment>

<comment>What I raised is absolutely relevant considering that you first need to come around with a consensus on which is the exact birth place of Ram ? When you are not sure with each making contradictory claims, how can you expect others to take your words at face value ?</comment>

<comment>There are no conflicting views on the place of birth of Ram.</comment>

<comment>Ha Ha Ha !! Make a visit to Ayodhya to know that !!</comment>

<comment>How do you know I have not visited Ayodhya?</comment>

<comment>You are such an innocent that you do not even know the provocative, acerbic  and incendiary statements made by your leaders on Sonia's foreign origin and so ??</comment>

<comment>I do support some leaders based on their qualities but they are not my leaders because I am not a political person. As to Sonia, do not forget what she, her son and her party leaders have said about Modi. Phrases like Maut ka saudagar, napunsk, butcher of Gujarat, to quote only a few, are no less acerbic and provocative than what the BJP leaders might have said about her.</comment>

<comment>So you justify that om grounds of tit for tat.   I do not think they anywhere said butcher of Gujarat !!Well what can one say about Feku who once castigated the then CEC James Lyndgoh by his faith and linked it to Sonia Gandhi in his public meetings.  He can go to any abysmal extent to score brownie points through cheap jibes and barbs !!</comment>

<comment>Yes, I have always been a votary of tit for tat. There is a proverb in Sanskrit 'shathe shathyam samachret'. A liberal translation' behave with a crook in the manner he behaves with you'.Modi is most abused and vilified person in Indian politics. It is a wonder he has retained his sanity despite such a long and vile campaign against him.</comment>

<comment>But are all those temples thousands of years old? Seems like ur rational brain's denominator is a 0</comment>

<comment>When was Ram exactly or even approximately born ?? Answer that logically and rationally and I will retort it with clarifications on your above query !!  Will you now do that for me Mr. Idiot !?</comment>

<comment>The case is still ongoing rite. This is being done so in case the court case goes against chaddis then u chaddi bhakts can send our supreme court to pakistan as well</comment>

<comment>Says a lot about you guys that he called for a ban on you all, called you snakes etc, but for you "right now he's the only one." Do you see the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of your position?</comment>

<comment>"The second component of the RSS game plan is to shake public confidence in every institution that can circumscribe or act as a speed-breaker for the RSS juggernaut. The Law Minister has already initiated moves to emasculate the Supreme Court via the judi cial commission and by threatening political monitoring of judicial ethics. Just in case his ilk got too rebellious, he has threatened to amend the law (through an ordinance) to permit foreign lawyers to practise in Indian courts. Briefless Jaffna lawyer s are waiting to fill the vacuum.The Human Resource Development (HRD) Minister has elevated an RSS activist to the post of a selector of teachers in the National Council for Educational Research and Training, a person who defends his credentials of valour by recording that he once had s hot dead a young Muslim girl to protect her honour and to end her misery while she was being gang-raped by Hindu youth during Partition.

<comment>"THE situation in India today is characterised and manifested by creeping fascism. Never before in our history have we been confronted by such an almost invisible phenomenon. India has seen a crawling imperialism (1750-1947) when foreign traders turned me rcenary protectors, and then slowly became our masters. But that process took a century to consummate and another century to unwind. The Indian people have also experienced the Emergency (1975-77) that came upon the land in a flash and went out much the  same way. Nevertheless we had got a taste of dictatorship of the modern state in that short period. We had felt it, hated it, but then the nation also revolted against it.Today the creeping fascism of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is coming upon us not as gradually as imperialism did, nor as suddenly as did the Emergency. Its spread is being calibrated adroitly by seven faceless men of the RSS, the RSS "high comma nd". We barely feel it. Some yesteryear civil libertyites such as Arun Shourie have been co-opted. Others are being wooed or chased"Words of Subramaniam Swamy in his Frontline Article dated  Jan 22 to Feb 4, 2000 !!</comment>

<comment>"Christians are being targeted by the front organisations of the RSS in order to terrorise and ghetto-ise all minorities. Since Osama bin Laden is stalking the Hindustan peninsula with his millions of dollars and narcotics, for the wily and cautious RSS.  Christians are an easy target because there are no Christian terrorists to retaliate. As the period of the Emergency clearly demonstrated, the RSS is astute enough to know when to hunt with the hounds and when to run with the hares. They are smarter than the German fascists in this respect.The third component of the RSS game plan is to ready the blueprints for implementing the agenda. Of course they cannot implement it in the present Parliament, but it will be their USP (unique selling proposition) for the mid-term poll. They have already  scripted the new history texts; they have sent into circulation amongst the faithful how the new Constitution of India should be structured"Words of Subramaniam Swamy in his Frontline Article dated  Jan 22 to Feb 4, 2000 !!</comment>

<comment>The RSS has exploited this issue since the Mandal OBC reservations of 1989. This has brought them from 2 seats to 282 seats in 25 years. Thousands have been killed, maimed and traumatized in dozens of well timed and well organized riots. The Parivar's blood lust is still not satiated!!</comment>
