<comment>BJP [See Khattar‚Äôs statement]is anti National as it wants to give reservations to Jats at the expense of merit seats without disturbing OBC Quota. BJP is anti-national. What MORAL right does left have to function in a multi party democracy when they are for single party dictatorship? Have left students forgotten Polpot Stalin who crushed INDIVIDUALS for building collective? Left is anti-human. Why was communist parties not banned. Kanhaiya Kumar, memebr of CPI  can be INDIVIDUALLYforgiven because communist parties were not banned.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What if the state is captured by a mob? India is a Ocholocracy [mob rule] as Individual rights( like merit) is murdered, by definition, as by reservation policy and Individual right of property rights are murdered by Socialism. Will you call Jats who destroyed an entire state as anti-National? Will you call kapus anti-National as they burnt a train. Reservation agitation is action as compared to just hot air of sloganeering [logically punishment should also be hot air]. VP Singh has made constitution anti-national and Modi I suspect will bring private sector reservations to become another VP Singh----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------No Support to Khalid. Kanhaiya Kumar is different as he is not a member of communist Democratic Students Union which is for the murder of Individual rights and is for collectivism. Communists support reservation policy, which is murder of Individual right of merit and also are for demolishing property rights another important Individual right.Kanhaiya Kumar as PM!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------However Let us examine Sedition laws------------------------------------1)Law of Vikamaditya: A prostitute hears a Brahmin who says to his friend that she had appeared in the Brahmins man's dreams and she was wonderful. The Prostitute drags the Brahmin to Vikramaditya for her fees. Vikramaditya hangs a bag of Gold and asks the prostitute to get her fees from the MIRROR. If service is virtual reward is also virtual. In sedition laws if the 'crime' is talking then the punishment should also be 'talking'2)USA Laws protect a person who burns the National Flag as the crime is CONSIDERED virtual and is not action. State acts when the 'crime' is in action3)In Kedar Nath Singh‚Äôs Case, 5 judges of the Supreme Court ‚Äì a Constitution bench ‚Äì made it clear that allegedly seditious speech and expression may be punished only if the speech is an ‚Äòincitement‚Äô to ‚Äòviolence‚Äô, or ‚Äòpublic disorder‚Äô. Subsequent cases have further clarified the meaning of this phrase. In Indra Das v. State of Assam and Arup Bhuyan v. State of Assam, the Supreme Court unambiguously stated that only speech that amounts to ‚Äúincitement to imminent lawless action‚Äù can be criminalised.There is a flaw in the LOGIC  of supreme court. How can an INDIVIDUAL be punished for the actions of the mob - particularly when India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] as the reservation policy agitation of Kapus and Jats showed. IS IT THE FAULT OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAT INDIA HAS BECOME EXPLOSIVE? HOW SHOULD THE INDIVIDUAL KNOW IN ADVANCE if a situation will explode? The faulty logic of mixed economy[read article on mixed economy down below] and acts of VP Singh, which made the constitution anti-National. Indira Gandhi has made the constitution anti-national by inserting socialism[as by definition legal robbery, as distinct from charity and implies forceful SNATCHING]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arun SHourie put the problem in two words Present BJP govt is congress+cow. He implied Modi has been a failure. Failed persons in politics can be dangerous. I strongly suspect that he will try to bring in private sector reservations and try to become another VP SIngh, who made the constitution anti-national along with Indira Gandhi when she inserted legal robbery of socialism into constitution.--------------------------------------------------------------------The solution is to test PM on the basis of  MERIT. He has not been proactive. I had recommended, earlier:Now BJP/RSS should be creative, PROACTIVE, and bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics. USA experience shows that goons kill each other in presence of free gun laws. None will kill with a legal weapon.2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=========================================================Mixed economy is a fascist economy. Bureaucracy/mafia politician becomes the supreme arbiter. Consider reservation policy: The only work of a government is protection of Individual rights - Jefferson, 2nd president of USA.. President of India as head of state has to commit suicide as merit, an Individual right, is murdered by reservation policy. The state is duty bound to protect Individual from mobs. Such arguments are not answered but ignored -- what the state does is right. Nazism was stateism like socialism. Those who could obtain power could justify state-sponsored murder and plunder by pointing out that since morals don't really exist and are merely a product of one's class or upbringing, there is no moral argument against the state version of murder and plunder.Socialism introduced into constitution during emergency is legal robbery. Way forward is capitalism[another name of freedom]Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim‚Äôs gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice. All ‚Äúpublic interest‚Äù legislation (and any distribution of money taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials and mafia politicians.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, but that it cannot be used honestly.Why does not the state allot a seat strictly on merit and snatch it away OPENLY?Gandhian Socialism of BJP is Gandhiism [selling of ones supporters to gain support of Jinnah and Muslims and Socialism is legal robbery]</comment>

Its BJP that will ultimately be benefitted from this..</comment>

<comment>It is merely incidental that the BJP is ruling Haryana. Whether riots happen in UP, Assam or Karnataka, this author & his ilk will find ways to drag in BJP without letting you know who the respective CM is.So the author must have jumped in glee at this golden opportunity to go after a Sanghi CM and other pet symbols of communalism, the Gita and the cow.Regardless of evidence going around of Congress' hand behind this organized violence, the author remains steadfast in his focus on his usual prime target, a BJP CM.</comment>

<comment>What proof is there that the Congress is behind this?If Anna Hazare had protested now, you would've said that Congress was behind that. Stop spreading misinformation.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for those links. It does seem like there could be a connection, but, Hooda's aide doing something doesn't necessarily mean the whole Congress party is involved. Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see further developments in this.</comment>

<comment>Imagine the media outrage if a BJP ex-CM's aide is caught having a suspicious phone conversation during riots.</comment>

<comment>A sad comment on the leadership and the administration and police. Khattar has proved to be utterly incompetent which is hardly surprising given his complete lack of administrative experience. We need to introspect how to address the central problem of our polity - how to keep sectarian louts from tearing the society apart through their vituperative outpourings - Saini, Yogi Adityanath, Sadhvi,  Owaisi, Azam Khan are all symptoms of this disease. Why does out politics encourage hoodlums of all kinds to ferment trouble in their bid to create a constituency for themselves ? Do we need a different Constitution which will give rise to a different kind of politics that does not incentivise the exploitation of societal fault lines by divisive politicians ?</comment>

<comment>Until Indians wake up and realize, all of their  major problems are unsolvable because they do not have a ONE PARTY DEMOCRACY like China and call it National Party if you hate communism, that has ONE purpose, ONE agenda and ONE goal - to serve the people of India. Until all religions, caste, races - everything comes last, they will continue to fail.Once they abolish multi party system designed to divide and rule by IMF bankers, then only India will have the balls to resolve problems permanently and make progress to root out massive corruption and status qua and bring in massive investment to create millions of jobs.</comment>

<comment>ha ha ha hathe most stupid comment I have ever read</comment>

<comment>Brother, I think I have to list you every thing.Nehru delayed sending the army to Kashmir when the Kashmir king Hari Singh wanted to join India after independence. By that time Pakistan army started to occupy Kashmir.Tyagi famously criticised Nehru's statement in the Indian Parliament in the prelude to the Sino-Indian War: Nehru commented that "Not a blade of grass grows in Aksai Chin", attempting to explain that Aksai Chin was a barren, inhospitable land and the nation had lost little by its occupation by China. Tyagi retorted, pointing to his own bald head: "Nothing grows here ..should it be cut off or given away to somebody else?". Please Google search it.Why go too far, Congress corruption, 1....2....3.... etc. 2G scam "2 Lakh crore."It was Rajiv Gandhi opened doors of babri masjid. Please google search. It is mentioned by Pranab Mukherjee himself. It is also mentioned  in Wiki. His Grand father was responsible for loosing part of Kashmir by delaying to send army. He was responsible to loosing war to China.As mentioned above Communalism and hatred and caste system and the disgusting of rich and poor all because of Corruption of Congress. If you want I will add more in my next reply to you.I am not saying all these things just like that. If you know how to Google search please look for your self.</comment>

<comment>one thing is clear, u "hate" the Congress party and its leaderswith such hatred in mind, any sensible comment is out of the questionI can counter your allegations and list you the achievements of the Congress and its leaders, but I wont.like most blind feku bhakts u wont listen.you can drown in your hatred for all I care</comment>

<comment>Well said. I am not into any politics. What you sow that you will ripe. I think you forgot all the scams involved in Congress. You no need to Google search for it. You can ask a kid for that if you don't know.Who created Kashmir problem when it had been solve long time back while independence?Nehru "declined a United States offer" to India to "take the permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council" around 1953 and suggested that it be given to China, according to the United Nations Under-Secretary General, Sashi Tharoor. Now we are begging for it.</comment>

<comment>The Govt goesnt need to Congress to ruin it. Its very competent to do it themselves.</comment>

<comment>Hope you remember how Nehru delayed sending the Army to Kashmir and hence we have Kashmir problem and we spend for Army more. It is because of Dynasty party. And the list goes on and on and on...</comment>

<comment>Becuase of dynasty India is still one country,if bhadvas,rascals and scoundrels,jumlebaaz,HIJDAS, of today were to rule then India would have disintegrated long back</comment>

<comment>It was game show by Congress so that they support New World Order. Because Congress rules more than 58 years of rule we are suffering and in the state of crumbling down. Because Congress sold our nation.</comment>

<comment>The article writer is super biased. Looks like he is PAAP fan or working member..What is happening in country specially in hariyana on reservation is all side effect of vote bank politics played by Congress for so many years...Everyone is demanding Reservation as they sense the discrimination.We should have got rid of reservation so that real merit prospers..</comment>

<comment>This will be all India story if Reservation is not dealt with. The original idea of reservation was to ensure a leveled play field. The historically oppressed castes were supposed to get their due rights and respect with reservation but votebank politics of this era killed this idea. If reservation is given on political significance then none ca save India.</comment>

<comment>Agree. I am a BJP supporter but slowly losing patience. I come from Haryana non-jat family and feel cheated by the way Haryana govt. succumbed to the pressure from Jats as BJP came to power in haryana mostly on non-jat votes.

<comment>No actually Congress has gone much beyond that!!!! They have made contacts in the Orion galaxy to recruit planet drohis to not only sell India to Pakistan but to lease it to the life forms from there. We all must take note and act accordingly now!!! When those Orion wasi comes do not forget to take your selfies with them and shout "Bhatat mata ki jai!!!"</comment>

<comment>It seems to be sarcastically. If it is true then you are loosing your mind.Please google search.It was Rajiv Gandhi opened doors of babri masjid. Please google search. It is mentioned by Pranab Mukherjee himself. It is also mentioned  in Wiki. His Grand father was responsible for loosing part of Kashmir by delaying to send army. He was responsible to loosing war to China.</comment>

<comment>My friend, of course I am sarcastic. What else? When the Congress was there before every blame was given to the British. Now the present government gives all blame to the Congress. The next government will give all blame to this one. It is  a cycle and nothing new in that.</comment>

<comment>If we want we can find more faults than the ones you have stated. I can also tell me father that he has not done as much as what was possible. But remember, our own children will say that we have not done enough or have not done properly. Similarly, the present government must do some real task and not find excuses any more. It is as simple as that. You have to perform.</comment>

<comment>It is very odd that you don't understand. It is all there in Google search. Hope this will make you understand. Please read slowly and carefully.Even though BJP has majority in Lok Sabha they don't have majority in Raja Sabha. Congress is leading in Raja Sabha. So all the development/so called development is being stalled/halted by Congress.To get the majority in Raja Sabha you have to win in state election because MLAs select/vote MPs in Raja sabha. There is constitution formula for this.Moral of the story. Congress don't want development in India. Hence secretly it is sending signals to westerns countries and Pakistan to create unrest, so called intolerance and communal violence through media, social media, terror attack and what ever means to impress the people of India that Congress is peaceful rule than any other rule and there by loot our money and put it in Swiss bank only to be used by Western countries.</comment>

<comment>Google is not the last word for everything. It is the duty of the Prime Minister to reach out to the opposition for the business of the houses. He always cannot be on confronting mood. They should now how much they have disrupted themselves when they were in the opposition. So now they must understand how to reach out and talk about consensus.  Congress also blamed the BJP of frequent disruptions. Will you go to the people and say "look what the Congress has done you can google in the internet". Will that do? People do not know, they have voted them to power overwhelmingly since Rajiv Gandhi's time. Now they better act responsibly. Do not give excuses from the past. We want the answer now.</comment>

<comment>India is too big a country and there will always be incidents happening specially if you are looking for them as excuses. To use those dadri/rohit/jnu like incidents to disrupt parliament is something which tells about intention of congress.. and i guess you can't compare the scale of 2G/Coal/CWG etc with the incidents mentioned above. Even an aam aadmi can see the intention of opposition in stalling parliament.</comment>

<comment>Yes let us continue to go on blaming the Congress and do nothing ourselves. That is the solution you want I suppose.</comment>

<comment>so you endorse stalling parliament due to the non-issues or isolated issues? I am all for opposition to debate or stall parliament for few days if they want to press for their demands but to wash sessions after sessions like this exposes their intention. But, I am afraid I can't propose a solution to this logjam. I see opposition stepping back on this only in case they are drubbed again in 2019 and then they might learn to respect the mandate a bit.</comment>

<comment>Please already know about Congress that you do. I am commenting all this things for the people like you. Google is not every thing but it provied lot of information. Hope you believe that.People overwhelmingly voted them because Congress because there had not been any Social media or TV channels like we have now. It was a hype created by Congress. After ruling 58 years of rule and having much dominated many areas and injected/spread its ideology like education system (We all studies Nehru loves children, do you know Nehru also loves something else.) and Doordarshn (Hope you know what it is or else Google search it.) It was recently known fact from President that Rajive Gandhi opened the doors of Babri Masjid and there by spread communial hatread. etc.</comment>

<comment>I am sorry. I am not much interested about the past, I am interested what will happen to us in future. People do not have patience any more.</comment>

<comment>I will tell you what will happen in the future. They will continue to corrupt and if possible they will even disintegrate the nation.

<comment>There are many chief ministers whose credentials may be worst than Khattar and atleast khattar is not dishonest.I dont think he should read Gita whole life,however he may follow gita but more essential will be reading the CHANAKY NITI which gives more apt solutions to most difficult situations.</comment>

<comment>Shameless Government which understands only the language of violence and catipulates, crawls  and bends  before the might of the arsonists and ransackers  who have rebelled against the State inciting terror  while in the same vein, this shameless Govt. is  targeting innocent Students studying in Institutions of higher learning just because they make allegedly inflammatory statements and clamps  the draconian act of Sedition on them !!The moral of the story is that the Government is encouraging violence as the only form of tangible protest to achieve your nefarious ends !!</comment>
