<comment>BJP supporters are very afraid of kejriwal and making false story. They are saying this everywhere that he is corrupt because they cannot  believe that someone could be honest.Because 97% politicians in BJP are corrupt. Rest are with crony capitalism or roiters.</comment>

<comment>AK is Aurgangzeb of the new era, he is going to finish anyone who comes in his way.. he finished Anna, Prashant Bhushan and Yadav.. and interesting is Ashutosh and Ashish Khaitan know this.. with AK's deteriorating health, New Aurangzeb will be in making in Ashutosh and Ashish Khaitan.. who knows AK needs to have protection from these two very soon..</comment>

<comment>You seem to have hallucinations. And that is the biggest limitation of anti Kejriwal forces. You guys never focus on ACTUAL things being told and done by AK and AAP, but in concocted created things, hence losing support of people, from Delhi to Punjab. The only answer is from voters. Soon enough in Punjab.</comment>

<comment>I dont support Aurangazebs atrocities on the people of  india  but you have to agree Aurangazeb was a deeply religious  lived his life as a simple man who had to kill his  brothers and all his relatives  as they were  corrupt and imprioson his father as he was supporting corrupt.  AK is a simple religious man who had to remove  the corrupt people (  prashant and  Yogendra yadav)  from his party and ignore  his father like Anna as he supported them then .But please dont compare  AK to Aurangazeb  as AK  doesnt do atrocities on peopleI agree that  the lieks of Ashutosh and Ashis ketan  are out  there only for power and AK has to be careful about them lest they   damage him</comment>

<comment>When Kejriwal first took on the political class during Anna movement, they  called him an outsider who has no right to question elected politicians. When AAP was formed they dismissed as it as a nonentity. When Kejriwal questioned the misdeeds of Vadra, Ambani, Khurshid etc, they branded him shoot and scoot guy, hit and run guy etc with the help of paid media.. When he protested against high electricity bills, he was called a Law breaker who doesn’t respect constitution.  When he decided to contest against Sheila he was called a Fool and idiot.. When he promised free water and electricity they called him unrealistic. leftist, communist and anti-industry.When AAP won 28 seats in Delhi assembly, they called it a Fluke. Whey AAP decided to form Govt, he was called a cheat, U-turn king,  Congress B-team head, Sonia agent and so on. When he protested for woman safety they called him urban Naxal, Maoist, Anarchist, Disruptionist, and Dharna man. He was also branded khap supporter, Jihadi supporter, Kashmiri terrorist supporter, racist,  anti-national, US agent, Pakistan agent, ISI agent, Vatican agent, Ford foundation agent.. and so on. When he resigned they branded him Irresponsible, Coward and Bhagoda.When he decided to contest against Modi he was branded Selfish, Opporutunist and Power greedy. When AAP won 4 seats in LS elections, he was written off and branded as a finished entity.  When he won Delhi again by a historic margin 67-3, they started calling Delhi people itself as fools and branded Delhi itself as a municipality. When he delivered on free water and electricity they called him an Ignorant who doesn’t know about economy. When a farmer committed suicide they branded him Insensitive, Murderer and Conspirator. When Kejriwal questioned Modi for snatching ACB from Delhi government they called him confrontationist and obstructionist. When Kejriwal questioned LG for declaring Delhi govt orders null and void they branded him mental patient and his actions unconstitutional.When Kejriwal constructed mohalla clinics, poly clinics public toilets etc they called him Nautankibaaz. When Kejriwal constructed flyovers by hundreds of crores less than the allocated amount they called it drama. When he passed whistle blower protection bill, citizens charter, right to service bill, Janlokpal bill etc they called him cheater and dramabaaz. When he talked about odd-even scheme he was again called an idiot and fool and was branded second Mohammed bin Tuqlak. When ink was thrown at Kejriwal they again called him dramabaaz. Now when AAP is tipped to win Punjab elections they have started calling him Bhindranwale supporter.BJP leaders, their paid media and paid trolls keep giving Kejriwal new new names every day. Their deep frustration is evident from the fact that they don’t even spare Kejriwals muffler and cough as a reason to criticise him. Since Kejriwal came to power,. people of Delhi are tasting the fruits of better civic services, concern for aam aadmi, better governance, responsive govt officials and more citizen friendly policies and hence are very much satisfied with the functioning of Kejriwal govt. Kejriwal and AAP should ignore the daily rants of BJP leaders, paid media and trolls and march forward undeterred.</comment>

<comment>Very well summarized AAP journey. And very right. The only answer to critics is to keep winning polls ahead: Punjab, Delhi MCDs, Uttarakhand..... All in 2017.</comment>

<comment>The rise of AAP has been a major threat to traditional corrupt political parties.No wonder efforts are made to enmesh themin the unending coils of controversies, legal battles and bureaucratic delays</comment>

<comment>No one needs to do anything.. AK, Ashutosh and Ashish khaitan brigade will very soon finish AAP internally.. wait and watch.. greedy to the core these guys are just here to sell you the same corrupt politics but in a sugar coated feel good manner.. Per internal news the game has already begun.. very soon you'd regret supporting them..</comment>

<comment>AK has to be careful of  all the other guys who are in  AAP to enjoy  fruits of power.  He is personally clean and unfortunately  seems  to trust these guys who will bring him only a bad name.  Because of that people like  u are mistrusting AK  and calling him names like Aurangazeb and corrupt etc.AK is not what you think . Pelase change ur opinion  and there is no one like AK in entire india  and in the history of india.</comment>

<comment>Note that AK didn't specify which year -- he means he'll repeat 2007 performance only!</comment>

<comment> BJP has become completely frustrated over the rising popularity of Kejriwal and   is resorting to cheap and dirty tricks oneafter another to somehow show Kejriwal and AAP in bad light. For that BJP has been using paid media and paid trolls in full force against Kejriwal.</comment>

<comment>Ever heard, you'll reap what you'll sow.. never understood it better than this time and in particularly with AK.. he threw out everyone who was a threat to his rule, he is so greedy for power that he can kill anyone who comes in his way.. he is Aurgangzeb to the core.. wait and watch, you'll regret supporting him very soon..</comment>

<comment>AAP's Vikaspuri MLA Mahinder Yadav was arrested on Friday under various charges including rioting and assaulting public servant during a protest against the arrest of an alleged sexual offender, the sixth lawmaker from the ruling party in Delhi to be arrested. He was supporting the rapist of the 3 year old baby !</comment>

<comment>so what.. Yadav is also supporting AK and AK supports Yadav... Who knows its their dirty trick to bring shame to Police..</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal's shit is sticking in Delhi and AAPtards are licking it to clean up the mess and present AK as messaiah !</comment>

<comment>AK has no money to pay workers but has waived off the electricity, telephone and water bills of Jumma masjid of Delhi which is approximately 10 crores. AAPtards want to consolidate secular votes to make khujli pm in 2019, AAP is the najayaz aulad of congress and there is no difference between the two !</comment>

<comment>BJP should instead concentrate on WB, TN and kerala to lose as the main opposition party so that it can take advantage in 2019</comment>

<comment>This is the right moment for BJP to lose this election and get ready to win massive in 2019. While congress does have the power to rule Punjab well for 5 years, i will be very happy if AAP did win and with congress support for the govt. They will be tested. In any event the BJP Akali Dal tie up will die naturally and 2019 will result in anti incumbency against congress</comment>

<comment>"KEJRIWAL FOR PM 2019" - A frustrated aaptard or may call Arvind Pujari...doing election campaign in comments below.</comment>

<comment>BJP to gaya !!!</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal is like a castrated dog, he has no balls to talk about Malda riots, ISIS, corruption of Sonia Pariwar, went to Dadri to consolidate secular vote bank, 400 page corruption document against Sheila Dikshit is buried along with Lokpal bill under the AAP office !--` When asked about Pathankot attacks, Malda riots, ISIS he replied saying that he would not comment on happenings outside Delhi and he is the CM of Delhi ! And now to Hyderabad asking PM to resign !</comment>

<comment>And you bhaktos have no courage to talk about development anymore. Only bark about non issues.</comment>

<comment>Nooone gives a shit to the Chaddis. You're no more trustworthy.</comment>

<comment>No doubt Ak 49 won because of the fatwa of Imam bikhari of juma masjid delhi ! Ford foundation's has been blacklisted by Modi sarkar and black money of 400 crores that flowed for AAP funds since 2011 has been stopped, kejri's balls will be badly hit in 2019 as well as 2020 !!</comment>

<comment>AAP MLA's give themselves a heavy increment1) 400% increase in salary2) 100% increase in lifelong pension.3) 500% increase in conveyance allowance4) 300,000 travel package every year5) 100% increase in daily allowance6) 650 crores spent on khujli shining advertisements and no money to pay for workers !``</comment>

<comment>I am truly amazed at the depth of Kejriwal's friendship with the accused IAS Officer Rajendra Kumar. The extent to which Kejriwal is going, to defend Kumar, his IIT classmate, room mate, Civil Services batch-mate and presently close confidante & Principal Secretary, is truly the stuff legends are made off - a very close relationship. And we are amused to see the likes of so called Intellectuals such as Ashutosh, Sanjay Singh, Raghav Chadda etc., going out of the way to defend Rajendra Kumar even before he can be deemed to be innocent or guilty!!!!!! yeh to AAP nahin, corruption ka baap hain ! CBI raid on principal secretary office was a shock for him !``</comment>

<comment>AK-49 was heard crying "Modiji aap ko pata nahin main kis mitti se bana hoon ! " People of Delhi replied Abe AK-49 humein pata hain ki tum to Suver ki tatti se bana ho because the whole Delhi is stinking with filth !</comment>

<comment>CM of half a state Delhi is the pre$$titute media's favourite. There are CMs of big states, very hard working and coming up with innovative ideas like Devendra Fadnavis of Maharashtra, Biju Patnaik, Shivraj Singh, Raman Singh, Vasundhara Raje, Raghubar Das, Tripura and Pondicherry CMS, CHandra babu naidu, Goa cm, Gujarat and haryana CMs but the sold out 89% corrupt media ignore them and highlight the only scheme till now -odd even rule which will fail as everyone will purchase and have an odd and even number vehicle at home. Delhi is just half a state and its CM thinks that the tail can wag and control the dog !. People of India are shocked how the Indian media selectively censors good work of Modi and highlights Khujli !-- Khujli is the dalal of automobile company owners !</comment>

<comment>AK has no money to pay workers but has waived off the electricity, telephone and water bills of Jumma masjid of Delhi which is approximately 10 crores. AAPtards want to consolidate secular votes to make khujli pm in 2019, AAP is the najayaz aulad of congress and there is no difference between the two !``</comment>

<comment>Why AAP will win Punjab?Because AAP volunteers work Harder!!!</comment>

<comment>educated men should not divide people with religion,some politicians may but we people in social media should not do that ,sir we doesn't like a leader but we should not react in this way</comment>

<comment>Very dangerous to trust AAP with a border state. Hope good sense will prevail in people.</comment>

<comment> Amrinder has forgotten that when he made his own Akali Dal ( Panthic) he himself have to face the most humiliating defeat in Punjab Assembly when he scored 856 votes and his entire party lost deposits. He has also forgotten that an army officer have to work minimum 10 years afterhis commission. He joined army in 1963 and ran away in 1965. He will make more comments in times to come and he has to be nipped in the bud,</comment>

<comment>BADAL will taste the dust, but Congress will win this time. Kejriwal is self appointed winner in every election he has contested. BJP should fight interdependently otherwise badal will share his dust with them. </comment>

<comment>. youtube. com/watch?v=7u2gINKaDBE17. Arvind Kejriwal said he will never give the ticket to corrupt and criminals, but we have seen so many instances where his candidates are criminals and corrupt both. In total 44 AAP candidates so far have criminal cases against them.https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=nUFFMmsHBh8http://myneta . info/ls2014/index.php?action=summary&subAction=crime&sort=party#summary18. Arvind Kejriwal said he is against High command culture. However, many UP candidates, even including few AAP founders on camera said there is high command culture in AAP and only top 4-5 leaders decide everything.http://www. youtube .com/watch?v=YbiWLvl2eAA (Arvind says no high command culture in party)http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=hrlSsf-c7kQ (AAP MLA Vinod Binny explains why Kejriwal is a dictator)19. During the AAP meeting he said on camera that he will send all media people to Jail. He was not aware that there was a recording going on camera. Then when Media asked him about it he lied and he said he never said such things. He told the media how he can say such things to Media?https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=kgGAVyU7dQU20. Kejriwal said his leaders will not take government residence. But after becoming CM of Delhi he himself sent a letter and requested for allotment of two Bungalows each of 5 rooms.http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=EfkL3ECvxg021. Arvind Kejriwal said on camera that Vinod Kumar Binny never asked for any ticket and later when Binny opposed kejriwal then on camera kejriwal said that Binny did ask for a ticket.http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=2vHipvnUh_g22. Arvind Kejriwal hid the letter from Tata power that Tata power also wanted to raise power priceshttp://www. youtube. com/watch?v=VUMzHK60DEohttp://www. youtube. com/watch?v=EfkL3ECvxg023. Arvind Kejriwal said there will be transparency in ticket distribution . However, many cases came to light where the ticket was not given to most deserving candidates.AAP members claimed tickets were bought with money.http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=EfkL3ECvxg024. We all know Bhiujju Maharat who was a negotiator between Team Anna and Indian congress during Anna movement. We all saw him on tv (you can search on YouTube for videos). When Bhaiyu ji Maharaj opposed Kejriwal then Kejriwal on camera said he does not know any Bhaiyu ji Mahraj.https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=kReFgSYVS0c25. Kejriwal said he is against VIP culture but on camera we can see he is having a big security and he also got Z security.https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=2vHipvnUh_g26. Arvind Kejriwal said he could not find an atom of development in Gujarat. Please go and visit Gujarat you will know Arvind Kejriwal lied here also. Just for example Gujarat has been the only state in India where there is 24x7 electricity in every village.https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=MUWR3ibuoyA27. Before talking about Corruption by Robert Vadra Arvind Kejriwal said he could not find anything wrong about Sonia and Priyanka. But there are already proofs submitted by Dr Swamy about Corruption of Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka.https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=vV8DxIyUMIk28. Anna's ex-blogger Raju Parulekar accused Arvind Kejriwal for a scam of more than 200 crore rupees which came in during Anna Movement. Even on camera Anna said more than 3 crore people donated during the movement. When the media asked him about these accusations then Kejriwal could have simply denied them but instead he lied and said he does not know any Raju Parulekar. There are many pictures of Kejriwal with Parulekar on the Internet.https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=-wnOwbLJ87829. His detention in Gujarat was well planned by him in advance just to gain cheap publicity as revealed later by his mass SMS's sent well in advance asking AAP members for assembly. He said on camera, he is being targeted by BJP.https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=KAnWNzvNK7M30. Kejriwal's official website blamed Amit Shah, Modi, RSS for Muajaffarnagar riots. In a sting operation when it became clear that Azam Khan was responsible for the riots then they y simply deleted the press release without posting any apology. SIT report has come and they indicated BSP, Congress, SP leaders, but not even a single BJP leader is accused but Kejriwal made false allegations only on BJP/RSS.31. Arvind Kejriwal said Gadkari grabbed 100 acre land of farmers illegally. when media asked farmers then it was revealed that Kejriwal is lying.http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=HtGHcUjJlaghttp://www. youtube. com/watch?v=Ca4nR6FCbLs32. Arvind Kejriwal named Gadkari in irrigation scam even though he was not involved.Arvind Kejriwal had all proofs about Sharad Pawar's involvement in 50,000 irrigation scam, but he did not even name Sharad Pawar in any press conference.http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=tNSPGSVR-1033. When people ask Kejriwal why you are making accusations against Gadkair/Vadra etc why you are not going to court, then he says he does not trust court, they are corrupt. But in a letter to Muslim, he says that Prashant Bhusan is fighting cases to save the terrorist in Batla Hause encounter /Ishrat Jahan encounter. Kejriwal has faith in courts for saving terrorist, but not have trust in proving corruption of Vadra/Gadkari.34. Arvind Kejriwal says in Delhi that during his 49 days govt there was a reduction in corruption by x% reported by Transparency international but later Transparency international sent letters and clarified that they never said such thing in any of their reports.</comment>

<comment>AAP has removed corrupt minister  Imran from his post </comment>

<comment>1. Kejriwal claims the media is under control of modi and it is against him. But everyone saw him fixing interview with AAJ Tak journalist Punya Prasun Bajpai.https://www. youtube .com/watch?v=q6uvh35v_3k2.

He sent letters to Anna saying that all money received during Anna movement spent during the movement and no money left. Later he accepted that 2 Crore rupees still left of the movement. He never disclosed the actual sum he got away with, which is estimated to be well above 100Crores made from sales of crores of Anna cards.6. Nirbhaya issue - On one hand Kejriwal did protests in Delhi on camera asking for justice for Nirbhaya and strict punishment for rapists. But on the other, he gave Loksabha ticket from south Bangalore to Nina P. Nayak. Nina supported and easy sentence for the Nirbahya Killer and most brutal rapist Muhammad Afroz. It was Muhammad Afroz who double raped Nirbhaya, inserted Iron rot (wheel jack) in her body, took out her intestines. Because of brutal assault by Afroz, Nirbhaya died. Arvind Kejriwal gave justice to Nirbhaya by giving Loksabha ticket to saviour of her rapist and murderer.http://www. thehansindia .com/posts/index/2013-09-01/8216Most-brutal8217-juvenile-convict-gets-3-years-707347.

He claimed during the entire Delhi assembly campaign that Mafia of Congress and BJP murdered her and she should get Justice.

<comment>With all the monkey business taking place in Delhi right now,AK having successfully turned it into a gigantic kachra petti,than his intended objective of a Solar City,if Punjabis still want to vote AAP,then even God cannot come to their rescue!

<comment>Most unlikely that UP baniya will find support in Jatland.</comment>

<comment>AAP is becoming MungeriLal. The fact that the party ruined people's mandate in Delhi is fairly visible to Punjabis.</comment>

<comment>Modi has already ruined people mandate in India </comment>

<comment>To all AAPtards dreaming of Punjab..Check out the recent Chandigarh elections..;)</comment>

<comment>AK is a perfectionist. He learns the lessons fast. He understands his strength and plays his card accordingly. His predictions about elections are more or less coming true now a days.</comment>

<comment>umm...OK :)</comment>

<comment>To AAPtards ejaculating on Khujili...Please check the recent Chandigarh results...BJP destroyed all other parties :)</comment>

<comment>After the anti-national drama by JNU students following was the reaction of different parties -ABVP strongly protestedRSS took them on BJP is filing sedition charges.Kejriwal is SILENTPappu is SILENTNitishwa is SILENT.You know what these Mahapurush were silent on???JNU thugs were saying they will not rest until India is destroyed.Kejriwal & Pappu are perfectly happy with people who want to destroy India. They won't comment on it. But will run to protest at suicide in Hyderabad.If AAPtards still think Khujili is GOOD...you are morons and absolutely deluded!</comment>

<comment>This joker says "Delhi performance" what performance has he done in Delhi? five MP;s arrested from his party for corruption is it performance? This chuwa kulji want to become Hathi without doing any development in Delhi. After this chap took over as CM in Delhi becomes gundaraj like Bihar. Now the people do not want Punjab also to be the gundaraj hence this fraud kulji dreaming that he will win Punjab, but it is not going to happened. The Delhi people are fed up of this joker doing all nautangi, This chap is like Pappu only, made for each other barking like a dog in the street.</comment>

<comment>AK want CM post with all powers. He is not happy with limited power of Delhi CM post. If won in punjab.. he will take cm post in punjab.</comment>

<comment>Itna kyon dimag laga rha hai bhai.. Mintos kha aur dimag ki batti Jala.</comment>

<comment>lol</comment>

<comment>Though I like AK, he's showing the same arrogance that grounded modi in Delhi.</comment>

<comment>THIS guy even said  they are winning 100 lok sabha seats for sure.... And that's gospel... Don't we know what happened....With what face will he approach the people???? Isn't his parties and especially his personal images taken a beating since his Delhi victory???? His party is embroiled in every possible fiasco... How is the party different to other parties now???? Didn't they claim they are the antidote to other parties???Now proven beyond doubt he's yet another party only much worser.......</comment>

<comment>He is Winning in Punjab.</comment>

<comment>LMAO..</comment>

<comment>Wait for my LMAO after Punjab election. This is what I did after Delhi Election.. LMAOooooooooo.</comment>

<comment>Yeah..Khujili supported terrorist IshratKhujili supported Batla terroristsKhujili supported Afzal Guru.Just wondering, as a Hindu, WTF are u doing supporting this PIG?!!!</comment>

<comment>Hahahahah, you don't have anything else to say... Khujliwal, mufflerman, sandle pehnta hai, Naksali, terrorist. hahahhahahha. Find something relevant Kachha Giroh K member.</comment>

<comment>Don't fall prey to his antics...</comment>

<comment>For sure, I am not gonna fall prey into the hands of Akali, Badals or Amrinder.</comment>

<comment>For sure, then you are going to fall from the frying pan into the direct fire... My best wishes.</comment>

<comment>Thank you my friend, let us see who will win, they deserve at least one full term to see how they are different to other conventional parties, similar to Delhi. If people are not happy with their performance, they can vote for BJP or Congress or whatever next time.</comment>

<comment>No problem, best wishes.</comment>

<comment>To AAP Hindu supporters - Kuch sharam bakee hai ki nahee?I can understand muslims and Christians supporting this Allah Abraham Party. Being Hindu to support AAP is similar to throwing your own mother at the feet of IS..</comment>

<comment>Hahahahahah, I am laughing at your logical thinking. I am Hindu and I respect Muslim and Christians in the same way I respect Hindu. Do good and have good.</comment>

<comment>If AAP will win election I will leave India. If Congress will win any election I will leave this world and if somehow both will make alliance then I am going to leave this Solar System.</comment>

<comment>hardcore bhakt spotted. Leave India. Guess what, no one gives a fkc!!!!</comment>

<comment>LMAO</comment>

<comment>That is what slavery does to a person. Soldiers are killed and people like u give only fkc about Ishrat Jahan.</comment>

<comment>Arvind Kejriwal has unreal dreams that will turn into nightmares.</comment>

<comment>real or unreal but definitely nightmares for you.</comment>

<comment>Good one.. Bhagba Bhagat will cry then die after Punjab Election.</comment>

<comment>You are typical anti-Modi scumbag.</comment>

<comment>You are typical anti-AK67 NaMonia Bhagat..</comment>

<comment>will you keep your word?</comment>

<comment>I think AAP will win in Punjab. But I also hope that I am wrong.</comment>

<comment>you are actually disbalanced.</comment>

<comment>Actually you are a perverted Chamaar and liability to India.</comment>

<comment>Why you hope that you'd be wrong?? If AAP win won't it be good?? maybe as good as it is in Delhi..??</comment>

<comment>Aptards are highly corrupt. Wolves in sheep clothing</comment>

<comment>Aaptards win to give away Kashmir. Worse than communist. Kujrikhan is the most dangerous politician </comment>

<comment>By the time of Punjab polls, the halo around Kejri as a crusader against corruption would fall like a house of cards. So, no question Of AAP coming to power in Punjab.</comment>

<comment>Abuse apart, by many here, AAP is actually all set to win in Punjab with a highly discredited Badal family assured of repeating Congress Delhi performance and Congress led by Amrinder Singh being very divided among factions. Situation is so bad that BJP leader Navjot Sidhu has distanced himself from Punjab and his wife sitting BJP MLA Dr Sidhu has announced to resign. AAP on Jan 14 has exhibited a major success in Maghi Mela in Muktasar with a rally more than the combined audience of the other two political forces. Most AAP volunteers are young and candidates being put up by them shall largely be from out of the known and discredited political circles.</comment>

<comment>Look at this shameless SUVAR - Self Up Voting Atrocious Rogue ! 65 fake upvotes already and F*P editors continue to turn a blind eye !</comment>

<comment>Look at the rapid fire burn in you. Burnol needed? Poor chap.</comment>

<comment>I myself was there at Muktsar and about 10000 people that also brought by some big gun of Punjab ,very less as compared to Congress and Akalies,s rallies. Watch, wait and see then jump to the conclusion.  Here in Punjab communal cards are more important than Tamashas. Of course some Hindus always voting for Congress may vote for AAP.</comment>

<comment>You are the first BLESSED SOUL in Punjab to have this glorious opinion of AAP rally being smaller than Akalis and Congress in Maghi Mela. There have been at least 12 media reports that I have seen and even talked to a couple of BJP and Cong local guys on phone. ALL reports say AAP rally was far larger. And Cong and BJP guys say privately that they are surely losing. See my comment above upvoted by a huge number of readers. So congrats you have a different view. Question is how long do have this blessed view.</comment>

<comment>The difficulty with people like you that you people become blind followers of person even for life. Put brakes on thinking power which Almighty God has given, any how this Kaijriwal is just like other so called  Mentally Sick politicians ,no difference at all..</comment>

<comment>Life? I know Kejriwal's name for last four to five years only Sir. Don't get into life so fast. We were ONLY talking about ONE fact that of Jan 14 rallies which every report, comment and observation in media and by opposition parties also tell AAP was far far larger than both others. THAT's all. Do not get into a lifetime of 80 years based on one event. And if someone is sick or not, let people decide. So far no party in India has got the type of success in two to three years of formation as AAP has. THIS AGAIN IS A FACT. Tell me if any. You need NOT love him or vote for him.</comment>

<comment>sad and worrying issue is Sidhu rumoured to join AAP. again that buffoonish clown Guggi also wants to bask in the reflected glory of AAP. when will AAP learn to chose the candidates of right merits?</comment>

<comment>Siddhu won't. His wife may. Ghuggi has some impact in society. Do not worry. AAP is fully concerned about right candidates I am sure. They have now experience of Delhi to be more alert.</comment>

<comment>A party that has the most dramatic leader.. when they couldnt choose right one to lead them, little hope that they'd choose any sensible down below..</comment>

<comment>If AAP wins punjab.. who'd be the CM?? Will it make sense for AK to leave Delhi and take over Punjab (a full fledged state) or give it to Manish Sisodia for his loyalty in sticking to AK's antics while more sensible moved away?? what also remains to be seen is how AK who has so far just done blaming BJP for his short comings and have clearly got away with that does when Punjab gives him the responsibility.. But all those if Sikhs decide to put their trust in someone who is clearly a short arm of INC and who has done little for 1984 rioters..infact AK clearly declared that he has lost the files... either ways, very interesting situation for someone who tracks AK's antics closely!!</comment>

<comment>Why are you bothered? Let people elect AAP and AAP elect its leader. Whoever is CM, you are going to be permanent critic. You will never see a major peaceful political change happening. So, do not bother. Sip your tea and do the bhakti.</comment>

<comment>Prof.. you stooped below your dignified self and rather than being open for a debate, you shunned me like a regular troll calling me a bhakt without even knowing who i am.. too bad for a prof to be judgmental.. see this is what AK does to people.. he takes away all good that you have and brings out the bad in you.. and i will be permanent critic for anyone who plays with my country unlike clearly you who has lost his logical self in supporting a megalomaniac who clearly has no idea how to help people..</comment>

<comment>I have told the basic point of democracy: people elect governments not some stray individuals like us. People have elected Modi in Centre and AK in Delhi with huge majority and that should be respected. While Congress creating troubles in Parliament on small issues is no right, BJP NOT allowing Delhi govt to function using LG, Police and MCDs is far worse. Undemocratic. What plays with my country? Why do you guys get into the stupid shoes of Congress which once said India is Indira and Indira is India? Who has given you the right to think BJP and Modi are India and criticising them is anti-India? Government, State and Country are NOT the same. Simple college students of social sciences know it. Just as Indira Congress was stupid not to understand this, Modi BJP doing same mistakes.</comment>

<comment>I may be wrong but I think you need to have domicile in a state if you are contesting for assembly (and becoming CM).</comment>

<comment>If this is true, its because Modi is scared of AK :) :). AK will win everything and do absolutely nothing once he wins it!!</comment>

<comment>Aap will win with khalistan agenda</comment>

<comment>AAP should note that 'Picture abhi poori ki poori baaki hai" and show can turn any way</comment>

<comment>Setting of Kejriwal would begin in Punjab and will drown in Delhi.</comment>

<comment>I think Punjab is another State where AAP has a very good chance of coming to power.  But,  I am not confident that it will be a comprehensive sweep as in Delhi as Congress is a very strong force in Punjab.  Infact, the low index of opposition unity by fragmentation of votes will help the highly discredited Akali-BJPee alliance to save their skin by winning a few seats which they would not have if the votes had consolidated behind the main opposition !!So, it is possible that AAP will scrape through with a majority with Congress coming a close second and consigning the Akali-BJPee alliance to the dust bin of history like what happened to Congress in Delhi !!</comment>

<comment>Big question: - Will Sikh vote for someone who promised to take action on culprits of 1984 sikh riots if he wins delhi but most willingly lost the file with details!! more than 50,000 sikhs were either murdered or displaced in that riots..and INC leader Rajiv had openly declared - "Jab bada ped girta hai, to, Dharti hilti hai" This will remain to be seen if Indians have infant's memory or do you really have sane minds!!</comment>

<comment>AAP IL WIN IN PUNJAB COZ OF PATRIOTS LIK ME N KEJRIWAL...</comment>

<comment>hello. Karan.</comment>

<comment>hi karan how r u :) :) wanted to follow u but u locked  ....</comment>

<comment>Guys this bast@rd KEJRIWAL and another AAP snake ASHISH KHETAN along with TEESTA SETLAVAD worked for almost a decade in GUJ. to malign BJP, Modi and GUJ. police and at the same time glorified ISHRAHAT JAHAN as an icon of innocence and humanity...For God sake dear readers pls try to think neutrally and understand that pAAP are no different from these Arundhati Roy types circle of treachery and proIslamic propaganda.....kejriwal is deeply venomous bast@rd and not some harmless clown...</comment>

<comment>You are right. I know some one who worked with kujliwalbfor 2 years. Anti corruption fight is nothing but nautanki.  He is totally anti India.  All those who are supporting kujliwal probably mad or porkistanis.</comment>

<comment>Wow! Now I am convinced Delhi will be repeated in Punjab because abuses hurled on Arvind by bhakts during Delhi elections have also begun its repetition.</comment>

<comment>BJP is nothing in Punjab..AAP Is everything now in Punjab</comment>

<comment>Europe will become Islamic countries soon. Watch baba Vanga prediction coming true</comment>

<comment>That is their headache...When even the daughter of Subramanium Swamy runs away with a Kutlet Muslim what else shall you can expect</comment>

<comment>We will win in Punjab. We will divide the state and rule. All lower caste are with us, AAP cannot win</comment>

<comment>Even BJP wants to Divide Maharahtra</comment>

<comment>ROFLMAO......</comment>

<comment>Yes..Jasoda Ben has given he third RTI against Modi....ROFLMAO</comment>

<comment>hahaha  guys remember his lamo.......:) c how he il vanish after elections</comment>

<comment>having seen the situation in DELHI people should be cautious in vote to AAP, Punjab is a border state people should vote for patriotic party.</comment>

<comment>Which patriotic party? One which drowned Punjab in drugs? or one which drowned India in corruption?</comment>

<comment>it would be good for BJP to leave the battle of punjab...let AAP finish cngress or the other way around...let the actual son fight with adopted one...it would be la karan Arjun Moment.....</comment>

<comment>Only issue here is that Kajru would be CM of Punjab while remaining CM of Delhi, Out of so many, not even a single parasite of his pubic hair in AAP qualifies to possess any post equal to or greater than this Khajoor.</comment>

<comment>Oh! Only drug mafias and corrupt thieves are qualified!</comment>

<comment>We all know the situation in New Delhi . months together employees were not paid. But MLAs were paid 400times salary hike. AAP has money to spend about 550crores for advertising but not for paying salaries to government employees. People are watching AAPbwill be number one place with single digit MLA seats. This is my bet.</comment>

<comment>AAP has money in Delhi bcoz it is not corrupt. BJP in Delhi MCD has no money to pay to its employees bcoz the bosses has siphoned of all resources.</comment>

<comment>Congress needs to die</comment>

<comment>............ and would not contest the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in 2017............ Mr. Kejriwal never speak against UP government. Reason he got first taste of severe slapping & arrest in UP even before Anna movement. Abhi bhi ruh kaanp jaati hai.</comment>

<comment>genius ho bhai!</comment>

<comment>AAP being called 'dangerous' is good omen..... same happened during delhi elections and the rest is history</comment>

<comment>The AAP in Punjab is becoming a party of the clowns.</comment>

<comment>Same was told during Delhi elections. Modi even called Arvind a naxalite! History repeating itself !!!</comment>

<comment>Kejru himself had declared that he was an anarchist and the naxalites are also anarchists. That makes Kejru a naxalite too.</comment>

<comment>I am sad that my favourite feku has no chance in punjab</comment>

<comment>I am sad that corrupt and anti nationals of AAP & CON has chance in Punjab!</comment>

<comment>Sorry, not only Punjab, your honest "न खाऊँगा, न खाने दूंगा" is losing election after election everywhere! Seems, people are seeing through Vyapam, Lalitgate, DDCA etc etc etc!!</comment>

<comment>Don't worry the ghost of Bhusan and yadav is chasing you.... They were equal contributors to your victory in Delhi... But since they are going to be in the fray...kujli will sure have wet pants. Remember their reputation is more higher than Airwind any day.... Prior or after Delhi election. </comment>

<comment>Delhi has more Haryanivs than Punjabis. What happened in Haryana !</comment>

<comment>Kejru replacing congress silently, by not attacking congress he is making congress irrelevant in indian politics. He keep attacking bjp, so that with course of time people will start realizing AAP as bjp's main opponent.</comment>

<comment>more or less thats gonna happen..with congress became irrelevant..Indian democracy had vacuum for opposition....all this Mulayam, mamta, thackeray's, Jailalaitha, laloo, Bhaloo, Aaloo are doing regional politics....AAP somehow shown themselves as crusaders against corruption which is national issue (it is different matter how much they succeed and implement on themselves)....However at currents scenarios AAP looks to replace congress on national level...</comment>

<comment>Yes, may be after 100 years.</comment>

<comment>LOL..... Just go back and remember your recent predictions for BJP. From now on await "wipe outs" for BJP. Now as per your "predictions" where will BJP win?</comment>

<comment>Modi will be a one film hero. He will become irralavent after 2019. Just wait and watch. He will not even fit in Gujarat.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. He will be famously called "Jhumla geero"</comment>

<comment>I think the film and drama analogy falls in the domain of Kujli and I accept his fate to be true after 2019.... On the other hand I believe modi is one man army... Whose approval rating is consistently very high.In the meantime Airwind is giving a run for the money to Rajiv Masand in film reviews...</comment>

<comment>The NDA will  in Punjab and Assam outright and will greatly improve its position in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and West Bengal.</comment>

<comment>Punjab?????? Really? Despite anti incumbency? You truly are a steadfast bhakt!!!! Position will 'improve' in Bengal and TN? How many seats do you expect them to get in each of those states? How many seats have they got last time?</comment>

<comment>Yes, I am a bhakt but before me is 'desh'. That makes me a 'deshbkakt'. The NDA position will improve greatly, not just improve, in TN, Kerala and WB. How many seats it has in these states could very easily be found if you Google.As to Punjab, there are two indications that the SAD-BJP combine is returning to power for the third time. One is their performance in the civic elections in Chandigarh, the Capital of Punjab and the chickening out of both Congress and the AAP from fighting the bye poll for Khadoor Sahib constituency.</comment>

<comment>how many seats PAAP will get if they fight in West Bengal....why they did not fight Haryana after 67-3 verdict, why they did not fight Bihar.....there are lot of why to answer....and sadly u have no answer</comment>

<comment>no way....say no to aap</comment>

<comment>Dr you have company....</comment>

<comment>And give double thumbs up and a big "yes" for the drug peddlers of Punjab under the current leadership???</comment>

<comment>Analysis of Capt Amrinder Singh seems to be correct when he said "This is not the Delhi AAP. That is a citizen’s AAP. Here, you’ve on one side the extreme left, cadres are breaking from the Congress and joining, then you have the frustrated youth, then on the extreme right, you’ve the Khalsitanis joining. That is going to be, to my mind, a destabilising force for Punjab...Here it’s a dangerous AAP that is emerging for the peace of Punjab."</comment>

<comment>similar comment were their when first time AAP contested in delhi....it is a typical response by a major political party against new entrants...nothing new...</comment>

<comment>No. First AAP is not a "new entrant". It has won 4 MP seats and it is already about 4 year old phenomenon. Second, on the ground , we know that Amrinder Singh analysis is correct.</comment>

<comment>and AAP proved them right by their antics....anyway good luck...</comment>

<comment>65 years on after independence, the prevailing political scenario in the country was such that any upright patriotic individual would have become disillusioned by the kind of politics practiced by mainstream political parties like Congress and BJP. Their politics involved violence, large scale corruption, Looting public exchequer, murder, crony capitalism, middle men, hawala transactions, smuggling, Counterfeit currency, Drug trade, Vandalism, hooliganism, finanacial frauds, inciting communal riots, sellling off country’s assets and resources to crony corporates and foreign powers, Nepotism, abuse of power, conflict of interest etc.In came Kejriwal who started loudly questioning the misdeeds of BJP nnd Congress and their cozy club like clandestine dealings. From then on, the corrupt political parties have lost their sleep and are trying their best to somehow get Kejriwal out of the way so that they can continue with their misdeeds. For that they are using paid media, paid trolls and all the dirty tricks at their disposal  in full force against Kejriwal</comment>

<comment>The above all examples will suit AAP today.... They Are proving no different to other parties in a very short time. </comment>

<comment>Every entrant came more or less similarly....however very few take broader national level issue and hence limited to state level...</comment>

<comment>U 4got to mention ..... Questioning the Misdeeds of other Parties WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE. Even Ended up in jail Because of this. Probably Will go to jail again in Arun Jaitley's defamation case. U never questioned his intentions.</comment>

<comment>The itching has started. If the itch worm kujjli thinks he can win punjab, then he must devise a plan to rule delhi-punjab in accordance to the failed odd-even scheme!! Lolzzz</comment>

<comment>even president rule is better than congress, leave alone AAP or BJP.</comment>

<comment>Isn't he from Congress?</comment>

<comment>With all his minus points, and some of them fairly serious ones, AK still remains the most credible of all the Indian politicians. In Punjab this contrast between him and others is even more stark. Akalis and BJP have sunk the prosperous Punjab to the lows the state had never seen in the history. Congress has no credibility left, although Modi & team are working hard to revive Congress. And this leaves field wide open for AAP in Punjab. Indeed a landslide victory is inevitable for them.</comment>

<comment>Swaraj Abhiyaan's Bhusan and Yadav have much more enviable reputation than Airwind.... They were equally if not more in contribution for AAP's victory in Delhi.</comment>

<comment>Bingo! I agree. With them in Party, AK's personal ambitions and individualism could have been kept in check. But now he is uncontrollable. Earlier AAP was a movement ..a mission...now it is Pvt. Ltd. Party.</comment>

<comment>Very true..... No doubt he's become a jack of all trades... King of none.</comment>

<comment>Aap will only recruit all anti nationals. I'm sure lot of its funding comes from Isi via Middle East.  Most wanted terrorists like hafeez Syed openly support AK. </comment>

<comment>M ready to support ur mom !</comment>

<comment> you mean they will recruit all anti nationals, get anti national funding and all agencies will be sleeping over it?     then what national security are we talking about? then not surprising Pathankot happens.</comment>

<comment>Bhakt hai voh..Dimagh nahin hai..samjha kao na!!</comment>

<comment>Well said! Dimag tou sirf khujliwal followers ke pass hai. Imaandaar kejriwal, Imaandaar kejriwal ka naara tou lagayenge, lekin swaraj, CCTV Cams, 500 schoools ka status nahi batayenge....</comment>

<comment>Kisi ke paas dimagh ho bhi sakta hai aur nahi bhi...Bhakt ka toh matlab hi BEVEQOOF hai...</comment>

<comment>Tera dhakkan to gharwali ko bhi nhi rakhya !</comment>

<comment>aap will win more than 100 seats out of 117....its a given. a C-voter survey gave it 55% vote share.!!!</comment>

<comment>not a very realistic figure but it appears it shall win 70 to 80 seats</comment>

<comment>i am up for it..even if its 80..its still  a stable govt..always better to be optimistic...it gives a postive energy to fight it out...and aneway i genuinly think ..they can get 100 seats..going by the response they are getting on ground...let see what transpires in future..</comment>

<comment>Hi dude read the recent court verdict???? Remember me????</comment>

<comment>more or less congress will be replaced by AAP in next ten years...AAP and BJP will be major foes on national level....</comment>

<comment>Con-grass-mukth Bharath is more important than anything else. We cannot afford to have a baby Pappu to lead India. If Pappu becomes PM then India will soon become a land of cartoons.</comment>

<comment>AK is also making it land of cartoon.</comment>

<comment>Yup that is what AK is working towards.</comment>

<comment>for AAP, BJP will be another opponent political party based on ideological differences while for BJP rest others shall be foes.</comment>

<comment>you nailed it dude...thats exactly what is going to happen in 10-15 years.</comment>

<comment>issue is which is lesser evil of the two?</comment>

<comment>as of now..aap is the lesser of the evil..</comment>

<comment>Obviously...AAP. AAP= Congress - Corruption.</comment>

<comment>between BJP and Congress, out of the two?</comment>

<comment>Between A team congress and B team AAP.</comment>

<comment>COngress digged its own grave by promoting pappu..its not about evil anymore....its a calculated blunder which congress made...pappu was incapable from day 1...but congress focused on him...and result is infront of us...</comment>

<comment>I said no..AAP of course.</comment>

<comment>The present Congress Party Leadership's only goal of acting against the mandate of the people, acting against the interest of the nation, hobnobbing with communal and casteist elements to divide the nation will remove the Congress totally from Indian psyche. In Delhi in order to shield their corruption they supported Kejriwal who is now paying back by not acting on the corruption of Congis. They want special dispensation from BJP and MODI Govt also, since it is not forthcoming, they are stalling all bills. The net result will be Congress mukt Bharat. The present leadership is acting only for preservation of their ill gotten wealth and they are not even bothered about the party.</comment>

<comment>Will he be the CM of Punjab too. He is better off going to Punjab as it has a police force etc. Pretty sure he wont as Delhi is suited for his type of agitational politics as he can give zero governance and zero accountability by blaming LG, Modi, Police, DDCA and Delhi Corporation even as far as blaming discoms too.</comment>

<comment>Joker has to joke that he will be a winner before elections and people will laugh at it on results-day !</comment>

<comment>Why wary, if kejri party is the first choice of Punjab voters then that's ultimate. But I toh sense a hung assembly followed by a AAPCON government..</comment>

<comment>In Punjab, The BJP-SAD will meet the fate Congress met in Delhi. Modi and Amit Shah should avoid any kind of campaigning in Punjab for sake of their personal reputations.</comment>

<comment>hahaha </comment>
