<comment>INR 100 Cr ~ USD 15 MM!The number sounds inflated. I mean, yes, you can go on piling up stuff and making things more and more expensive. However, a Bell  singe engine (can't recall the model either 207 or 407), well equipped, wire cutters etc., was around USD 1.5 ~ 2 MM in the early 2000s. Now it should be what, say USD 2.5 MM? Add another engine, say USD 3 or even 3.5 MM.</comment>

<comment>When India was divided by muslims, Jinnah clearly said he will take all  muslims back to Pakistan and Hindus have to go back to India. Then how come they the muslims who stayed here and how come they multiplied like there is no to'row from 4% in 1947 to 20% today while instead of sending the Hindus and Christians back they butchered them massacred them in Islamic Pakistan by muslims (sunni mostly) from 24% Hindus to 2% of Hindus and Christians. Is this the religion of peace or religion of terrorism? Read the speech carefully.....Transcript: MOVE TO PARTITION PUNJAB AND BENGAL: Text of Mr. Jinnah‚Äôs Statement, I and B. Department,New Delhi, 4th May, 1947Following is the text of Mr. Jinnah‚Äôs statement ........‚Äù ... The question of a division of India, as proposed by the Muslim League, is based on the fundamental fact that there are two nations- Hindus and Muslims- and the underlying principle is that we want a national home and a national state in our homelands which are predominately Muslim and compromise the six units of the Punjab, the N.W.F.P., Sind, Baluchistan, Bengal and Assam. This will give the Hindus their national home and a national state of Hindustan, which means three-fourths of British India.‚Äù ..It is obvious that if the Hindu minorities in Pakistan wish to emigrate and go to their homelands of Hindustan they will be at liberty to do so and ‚Äòvice versa‚Äô and those Muslims who wish to emigrate from Hindustan can do so and go to Pakistan; and sooner or later an exchange of population will have to take place and Constituent Assemblies of Pakistan and Hindustan can take up the matter and subsequently the respective Governments in Pakistan and Hindustan can effectively carry out an exchange of population wherever it may be necessary and feasible.</comment>

<comment>4 Sunni Muslim Groups Responsible for 66% of All 17,958 Terror Killings in 2013 By Patrick Goodenough | November 19, 2014 |‚Äì The number of people killed by terrorists worldwide in 2013 rose by 60 percent compared to the previous year ‚Äì from 11,133 to 17,958 ‚Äì with four Sunni Muslim extremist groups responsible for two-thirds of all fatalities, according to a comprehensive annual study.The report also found that Islam as a ‚Äúreligion‚Äù a driving ideology for terrorism has jumped significantly in the last five years, and accounts for most of the terror activity in the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.As a driver for terrorist groups, Islam religion far outstrips ‚Äúpolitics,‚Äù ‚ÄúOver the last decade the increase in terrorism has been linked to radical Islamic groups whose violent theologies have been broadly taught,‚Äù said Steve Killelea, executive chairman of the Institute for Economics and Peace.</comment>

<comment>You're just another victim of Nehruvian braindead syndrome...where the patient by hook or crook intentionally  interprets the situation to disparage Hindus..People are killed everyday , so what is the big deal here ?in UP itself a policeman was butchered just bcoz he was a hindu and was trying to stop a van driven by cow-meat mafia ....  where were your sensibilities then ? maybe your conscience was busy throwing stones  on a extended Haj during that period..People are killed for much trivial reasons for e.g people winking at someone and UP case was a menial law and order  issue , where unfortunately a man lost his life due to physical tussle rather than   a designed plan....So dont overblow a normal situation just bcoz it suits your antiHINDU agenda...if you want to reply , do it with some sense...</comment>

<comment>Cow mafia? Do you mean the export houses that made us number one? I have little info on where they operate and where they source the animals from or as you mentioned crime. Do share details. I hear Gadhaima is getting smaller, which is ofcourse good. :)</comment>

<comment>Apparently Punjab is on the boil, someone tore out sections of a hundred odd granths.I imagine the perpetrators and the sikh are suffering a senseless Nehruvian brain dead syndrome too.Unless ofcourse the argument is because people die they should be killed :)</comment>

<comment>Put every aspect aside and just consider on one glaring FACT---In last some centuries CHRISTIANITY & ISLAM have been the biggest murderers and butchers of the humanity and they have invaded and conquested almost the entire world , they have obliterated native cults from its roots , but ONLYHindus have given them some resistance and have protected half of our land , although other half has been surrendered to ISLAM..Therefore , think of Hinduism as not any religion but our home and identity , don't save cows , don't build temples but for civilization's sake not let even a single inch drift away from us anymore to the invaders...I am an atheist but a proud hindu....think about it...</comment>

<comment>Partition was a tragedy, but you do know millions of Muslims from this side were forced to leave for Pakistan against their wishes?</comment>

<comment>No one asked our muslim brothers who fought with us to divide India. They did by choice and wanted a country of their own where ever they are in majority. That is what Islam does, that is what Sunni muslims want. Only thing they know is to kill, kill, and kill and then divide. Do you know millions of Hindus and SIkhs were butchered by muslims in muslim majority areas of Hindustan that became later Pakistan. Hindus could not backlash due to Gandhiji. Remaining Hindus in Pakistan who were 24% in 1947 were butchered by muslims mostly Sunni to 2% today. How long this carnage by sunni will continue even today they butcher and massacre. Today 99.9999% of terrorism worldwide is by muslims and 65% of it is by Sunni muslims. On the other hand, generous Hindus in hindu majority India allowed muslims to multiply like pigs from 4% in 1947 to 20% today. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? This once again changed the social economic fabric of India. When you cannot even afford one meal a day, you have multiple wives in muslims with dozen kids how are you going to feed the family and on top of it you send them to madrasas to learn the medieval practices of Islam. Wah Allah..</comment>

<comment>From what I know there were large-scale massacres on both sides during Partition.</comment>

<comment>Please dont make it look as if there were large scale massacres on both sides and then undermine the losses of Hindus for no reason or fault of theirs. Tell me something. No one is denying that Hindus Sikhs Christians Buddhists who ever they were fought with Muslims for independence right? Read Jinnah's speeches. He said muslims cannot live with Hindu majority India and so we have to divide. Muslims did it ...Did Hindus tell muslims to get the fuq out of Hindustan? No never. It were the muslim brothers who wanted to separate and live in their own majority areas. Now, once division happened they started to massacre in muslim majority areas all the Hindus and Sikhs. In return, off course backlash was going to happen but read again....Gandhiji sat on Ansan in Calcutta and said Hindus cannot kill back. Even after partition, muslims have massacred Hindus in Pakistan from 24% in 1947 to 2% today. How did that happen? How did they grow from 4% in 1947 in India to 20% today? How did that happen? How did Hindus get reduced from 45% in Bangladesh to 7% - 8% today? How did that happen? So if you are logical get you facts right and read and understand but dont pass a general statement oblivious of what happened.</comment>

<comment>Bo-Red dont bring this casteism of Hinduism as your weapon. We all know you are a Sunni. Muslims are responsibile for 99.999% of the terrorism worldwide. And Sunni muslims are majority of 64% of terrorists. Go figure. They will kill anyone in the name of Allah and 72 virgins they will get if they kill and blow themselves as per their terrorist mullah.</comment>

<comment>What makes you think I'm a Muslim? And why have you adopted a Sunni-sounding name?</comment>

<comment>DOnt care what you are and who you are. You cannot divide hindu any more. Enough of this generosity Hindus have shown towards muslims and christians in India to multiply.</comment>

<comment>They're still roughly 80%</comment>

<comment>They were more than 80% they were 95% when India got divided in 1947 while Hindus were 24% in Pakistan and 45% in Bangladesh. Today Hindus have been reduced to 80% in India, 2% in Pakistan and 8% in Bangladesh. Malaysia used to be a Hindu Country and so was Indonesia where Sanskrit was used as a language with Devnagri lipi. Check it out. Today, Islam wiped out Hindus from there. Afganistan used to be partial Hindu country. So you want me to forget history but as late as 1947 Hindus were 95% in Hindustan. What happened?</comment>

<comment>You've got your numbers on india wrong. after partition there were 10% muslims left in India. In 70 years, they have increased to 13-14%, nothing to get alarmed about.</comment>

<comment>WOW first time you are trying to debate and be logical and wants to talk about facts and numbers? Lets do it Bo-red.You never talked about 24% Hindus in Pakistan who have been massacred, kidnapped, killed, butchered to less than 2% Hindus and Christians. WHY? Why is Islam so cruel?You never talked about 45% Hindus in Bangladesh who have been massacred, kidnapped, killed, butchered in the name of Islam to 7% today. WHY? WHY ISLAM kills non-muslims?Now, back to your point. Data shows that today muslims are about 18%. You say they were 10% in 1947. 8% increase is a huge jump ...it is equal to 80% jump my man. How is it possible that if Hinduism was so bad and Islam was soooo good that in muslim Pakistan, muslim Bangladesh you have wiped out minority Hindus and Christians but in India you grew by 80% and still you say nothing to get alarmed about? So when do we get alarmed ...when you are 25% and you start to demand your own land again? Didnt you do the same ...when you fought independence with Hindu majority + Buddhists + Christians + Sikhs + all others as brothers...and once you came closer to independence you were the only one who demanded a separate state and said you cannot live with Hindu majority. How long will Islam continue to be barbaric?</comment>

<comment>Doesnt matter.... what commie loonies have to think !</comment>

<comment>I don't know what you mean by 'commie'. If you literally mean 'communist', as in a card-carrying member of a communist party, the probability of anyone being one is statistically extremely low</comment>

<comment>;) No</comment>

<comment>so if BJP does loose this .... does that mean bhakts will shut their a**es? nope they wont :D</comment>

<comment>Shutting their a$$e$ means shit*ing from mouth. So mind ur language as Modiji supporters whom u arrogantly call bhakts never shitt from mouth.</comment>

<comment>AAP cant afford paid trolls like you buddy that's why they have volunteers... And we will make the nation just wait and watch!</comment>

<comment>Brainwashed bast@rds ,you militants are far bigger threat to this motherland than PAKIS themselves...Surely only an illiterate or absolute retard would be so dumb to support a venomous corrupt fraud like BHAGDOA... shame on you ...tera baap hoga paid BC....i am a nationalist and exposing commie antihindu serpents like AAP etc  is my objective...</comment>

<comment>hahaha calm down man .. whats with the abusive language? Is this what they teach you at troll camp by BJP? Dont worry ok feku will come and console you "nationalist" hahahaha</comment>

<comment>Awwww.... look at this madarssa-chaddi  preaching others about abuse and all...  Have you ever heard the kind of filthy vulgar lingo BHAGODA uses against both men and women...And its no at all surprising that words like 'nationalist' are a subject of  'patronization'  for AAptards ,coz you guys are gullible bunch of lambs who have been mentally-enslaved to loose all their senses and blindly follow whatever krap snakes in AAP have to order...And i do get enraged when i see fellow Indians so easily getting tamed by bunch of treacherous  NGOwalas in broad daylight ...but fortunately AAP's support is dwindling like melting ice in sweltering heat... ROFL</comment>

<comment>This is the most random reply i have ever seen not even a sentence of your makes any sense... lol ... looks like bjp boot camp i mean troll camp has been training you people to randomly whine and preach as well along with it... "sickular" "anti national" dont use big words you cant comprehend my friend. And please dont even talk about being mentally ensalved when you cant even see the irony of it all.. Mr Nationalist bahahaha</comment>

<comment>Bwuaaaah !!!90 % of your retort was composed of words used in my comment , secondly for shit you would get latrine bowl and cant expect a Lamborghini for it ..Hence, the absolute puke-worthy replies paid AAPtards as yourself ,  paste on FP would get the answer in similar language..Not only you trolls but even your leadership babble puerile BS most of the times , thus  i know its natural for you but still try to make more sense in your comments and then expect better from others.. lol</comment>

<comment>lil punk you think you can waltz in here using big words thinking you are smart now the game starts bring it Biaatch!!</comment>

<comment>oh really i was being "nice" to you why dont you button down that flapping upper lip of yours, goofy, before I staple it to the ceiling and watch you spin around like a fart-powered ceiling fan.If I want to hear from a rat-faced gimp, I'll either spit raw phlegm at you or waltz over there and piss on you. Until then, stick your head into your infected mange and let the stench knock you out already. You worthless gimp!!</comment>

<comment>Awwww... poor chap , is replying slapdash after i bulldozed his illiterate madarssa-arse... but even after finally mustering some courage and desperately composing a comment for minutes , he has copied lines from my previous comments.. ROFLMAO..Illiterate madarssa-kuntt is so insecure that he is still revolving around my deliberate instigation , as i EXPOSED his real 'uneducated' background , therefore to present a fake bravado and prove that he is a literate , this little sod is sweating blood to convince me of his mental and linguistic calibre.Such phenomenon establishes that he is a withdrawn , booted out , friendless weirdo and therefore dying for any kind of acceptance in the virtual world but more he tries , more of his repulsive uncouth personality becomes discernible...LMAOBut more hilariously he incessantly keeps on talking smack about BJP but this illiterate vermin fails to understand that such negative propaganda only garners more support for RSS/BJP..HA HA HA HA HA... but i would keep on playing with this harmless twat and would prod him to spew some more calumniation against RSS/BJP..and thus , this madarssa clown would keep on entertaining me with cheap comedy...ROFLMAO</comment>

<comment>You aren't even worth the appalling squandering of oxygen and water required to keep you from being maggot meat, you dungaree-sporting dufus. If life was fair, you would become a suicide bomber, you toe sucking terrorist. lol Feku is calling you to his cabin you know for what? ;)</comment>

<comment>Awww... bare-arse naked 'GAFOOR ' convulsing inside his ripped apart BURQA..... i can understand your blind lust and fascination for 'disparaging BJP'.. Those raging desert storm currents fondling with your unsheathed arse and constant arse-whipping by bearded savages  would surely compel you to talk shit about BJP/RSS..ROFL</comment>

<comment>Why don't you drill a large hole into the side of your head? That way when people call you a dumbass, you will actually have an excuse. Rumour has it you wasn't actually born, more something that germinated from a discarded test tube contaminated by an over-masturbating syphilitic laboratory technician's jizz in Bihar.You're the kind of guy who buys STDs from a viral lab just to make it look like you get laid.</comment>

<comment>Poor Mujaheedin , don't get so restless , i know your breed starts jactitating on their hairy bums  once your proJIHAD charade is debunked.....</comment>

<comment>Hey Mr Nationalist , Cat got your tongue?</comment>

<comment>Where the FK you at , you bloody madarssa-guttersnipe...hiding behind local maulvi's jihadi arse ?</comment>

<comment>Your value doesn't even amount to the Down Syndrome result of the escaped lunatic's sperm that fertilized your sister's rectum, Clown. Do the world a favour: go bungee jumping with the cord tied around your neck, you gangrene-brained straightjacket-escapee.</comment>

<comment>BWUUUAAAAAH !!!WHAT A HAPLESS CLOWNIlliterate , insecure , stinky MADARSSA-racoon dancing on my tunes , even when i made it amply clear the point about pedantic nit-picking over lingual vulgarity .... but still the zero IQ MADARSSA-rodent is stuck on the needle to prove his worth infront of me...As if i was his master and he is desperately trying to float his chances to become my favourite scullion... LMAO...</comment>

<comment>Your total worth amounts to less than a urinal filled with drunk's piss. Do the world a favour: go skydiving without a parachute, you unicycle-pedalling blubberhead in floppy clown shoes. You're worth less than a festering discharge from a leper's rectum in Calcutta. If you had any sense of decency, you'd throw yourself into an industrial incinerator, you inbred banjo-pickin' hillbilly. Again Mr "Nationalist"</comment>

<comment>BTW... it is pretty evident that you're a Madarssa-nurtured and consequently an AAP militant .... hence such jaundiced interpretation of present situation in the country..i am sure for you Nehru , Akbar , Aurangzeb , Queen Victoria , Teresa , Ghazni ,Genral Dyer etc would be esteem icons of Indian history.  ROFLMAO</comment>

<comment>Your total worth amounts to less than a fart from a flea's a$$. Do the decent thing for once in your life and juggle chainsaws while drunk, you rectal rim-polishing runt with a patented Twist N' Tuck tongue technique. You aren't even worth a shovel full of horse shit. Brighten the lives of your long-suffering parents: kiss the front of a speeding train, you victim of mis-prescribed medication.</comment>

<comment>What an insecure illiterate little twat , desperately trying to hide his cerebral incompetence by nitpicking on 'imaginary' flaws in life-skills of others....Listen, now its perfectly established that you're a low self-esteem recluse , who has serious social complexes , hence this antiBJP/RSS tirade is a form of outlet to vent out your frustrations arising from lack of social acceptanceLMAOOOOOOOOOO</comment>

<comment>Too much for ya to take thought you were the king dint ya Bit@h?</comment>

<comment>Where have you scooted off... you slimy illiterate bast@rd !</comment>

<comment>How cute .... a cyber militant who just have one trick which is to abuse , is trying to gain an argument advantage by whining at others  getting abusive... Lol , therefore take a dip if you cant handle slightest of indecent remarks as they're far more acceptable to the vulgarity you demonstrate..btw anyone who opposes a nationalistic organization like RSS is an ISLAMIC-apologist by default..</comment>

<comment>You may be the only person to ever gotten AIDS from a toilet seat by sitting down before the last guy got up, and you may well have been voted "Man of the Year" by Time magazine for having had more meat between your buns than McDonald's, but what you fail to realize, Mr. Double Award Winner, is that all I want to hear from you is absolute silence.</comment>

<comment>So cute ISIS-goat ! naturally, exposing the brutal truth about your beloved ISLAMIC political part aka AAP aka cancer for india , will force you to be defensive and hence such shambolic pretexts of 'fake bravado , 'self back-pating ' through infantile atempts at insults  blah blah.... do you really think , apart from your fellow thumb-thumping ghetto-nesters anybody buys that ... lol</comment>

<comment>If all your comments were edited to remove the supernatural, the incomprehensible, the unreasonable, the impossible, the unknowable, and the plane absurd, you would be silent. You contemptibly contrived c@nt.</comment>

<comment>You should enroll for some formal education instead of doing unintentional comedy on social forums. And your English is equally repulsive as your general understanding of politico-socio affairs.It seems you're a typical antiHINDU fanatic found in southern coasts ..LoLEven kids who are 10 years old would brain-grapple you....I hope you don't indulge in such retarded discussion in real life.And to even suggest that i would get affected by such juvenile class 5 ribbing  indicates you're just a nonserious troll with no self-conviction.</comment>

<comment>Stop singing like a retarded panda while rubbing Rogaine on your swollen manboobs in the hope of growing some chest hair and come away from that window you are wiggling your tiddler out thinking some passing mongoose will grope it for the first sexual experience of your worthless life, and get over here so I can force-feed you a generous helping of Shut The F@ck Up.</comment>

<comment>Bwuaaaahhhh  !!!  lol ...the most hapless AAP kunt i found recently....

<comment>BJP is loosing Bohar despite all the paid news, huge money, free scooty. Modi is loosing. he has refused to hold any more rallies now as they will have no impact. Shah wanted him to do more rallies.</comment>

<comment>Those anticommunist ppl criticising BJP for promising free goodies like TVs and scooties in Bihar must realise that its the need of the hour and its only a promise. BJP doesnt believe in the politics of freebies like AAP or Khangress. It's just a lollypop which is required for idiots like Biharis </comment>

<comment>Kal pyaz, aaj shakkar, parso burnolYeh Aam Aadmi party hai ya "scam aadmi party" hai?</comment>

<comment>Man ,Delhi BJP are bunch of toddlers... even 12th grade students could spank them...  Delhi BJP needs younger faces who are real S.O.B</comment>

<comment>AAP is finished..!No wonder bhagoda "ran away" from bihar</comment>

<comment>No wonder day by day AAP's support is getting weaker... look at these AAPtards on FP sweating blood in support for RJD , CONGRESS in Bihar.... this is their true colour..Similar to Bhagoda , who ran to Bihar to clean Laloo's boot..</comment>

<comment>I feel shantanu upadhyay must start eating pork and bring out his real identity</comment>

<comment>pork and beef must be banned in india. after all Obama can eat and we can beg to him and prepare for him but in india it should be banned</comment>

<comment>Wtf... I support beef ban too but what is ur problem with pork? We believe cow is mother but we have no relation with pig so I don't know why you making such a demand. </comment>

<comment>actually I hate pig . pork means garbage.</comment>

<comment>Then don't eat. If someone likes they can eat. Why asking for bans.</comment>

<comment>Oh I love bacon already.</comment>

<comment>I feel Modiji should bring back beef issue back in Bihar. No need to go low on this issue. Slowly and gradually it will polarise people and result in votes, but BJP must remain patient and continue raising such issues. Biharis are chewtiyas and sooner or later they will fall for it. It just needs more push .</comment>

<comment>good strategy</comment>

<comment>Dear Randipan: the day BJP wins bihar, i will find your house and dance all night with loud music in celebrations right in front if your house</comment>

<comment>Well said. I will join you and we will teach this sickular randipan and all his neighbourhood a lesson. All his locality must be punished with super loud music all night for housing such an idiot.</comment>

<comment>If BJP loses, modiji must cancel the funds package that Bihar was supposed to get. Then only these Biharis will learn a lesson. Modiji is doing so many rallies in heat and dust and requesting for votes, yet these bloody thankless Biharis are tilting towards nitishh kumar. Shame on Biharis.</comment>

<comment>Here comes another RJD worker...attempting to be funny like LALOO the clown.. LMAO</comment>

<comment>your desperation in the moments of defeat is a spectacle in itself.</comment>

<comment>LoL, you were so desperate thst you even changed your name?Apply burnol dear</comment>

<comment>you shut up you shameless impersonator.</comment>

<comment>You are the impersonator you shameless swine AAPtard. I was impersonated by one of your AAPtard geeks. </comment>

<comment>What was his previous name ?</comment>

<comment>LMAO.... desperation is your virtue of existence...coz you as an aaptard is exerting all his sweat to do 'prachar' for RJD.. LMAO</comment>

<comment>please have courage. donot be so nervous. it is part of life. after all you will reap what you have sown. please cool down.</comment>

<comment>Awww...  poor poltroon faking to be sober and snooty.... i can understand your frustration after being thrashed in DU elections  and ppl hating AAP even more than khangress in delhi LMAO  ...AAPtards would sell their families  to ISIS just to make BJP loose...you guys are more harmful to India even the PAK itself....Therefore most of ex-AAPtards have understood this fact hence ditched AAP...now only few communist , ex-khangressis + antihindu loonies  and muzzies support AAP..</comment>

<comment>this is true for bharat jalao party also. people are fed up with jumlabaji</comment>

<comment>if you don't get support then bihari are shame. what about delhi . I think it represents our country. am I wrong. 67-3</comment>

<comment>How does Delhi represent India apart from being the "only" capital of India?? Does atleast 50% of Delhi population speak either Marathi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam or Tamil. How does it represent an entire diversity of India... I just fail to understand!!! care to elaborate?</comment>

<comment>It is Modi who himself declared in his election campaigning during Delhi election that "jo desh ka mood hai wo Delhi ka mood hai"</comment>

<comment>Ok agreed... he was talking about the voters mood in India which just elected for a change in Lok Sabha and so should Delhi too. How come a past present tense of a speech which actually talks about voters "mood" can be understand as a "REPRESENTATION" of pan India???? Unless u r confusing yourself... but thats just plain lack of comprehension my dear Roshan!!!</comment>

<comment>you are an anti national. why are you writing such disturbing comments. they are already so nervous.</comment>

<comment>reply to your question lies within your reply itself.</comment>

<comment>So Delhi does NOT represent India!! Its just another moronic propaganda of AAPtards???</comment>

<comment>what you call for BJP supporters ??</comment>

<comment>Bhakts!!</comment>

<comment>only?</comment>

<comment>"curtailing others freedom, ban philosophy and denying human rights"... care to explain or run away like delhi representing India???</comment>

<comment>I was thinking the other way round like aap - apptards. anyway thanks for opening my eyes.</comment>

<comment>Well then your thinking was wrong! You are welcome btw!!!</comment>

<comment>why you want to shame them?</comment>

<comment>are you asleep? if not then are you really that stupid?</comment>

<comment>"New Delhi has a population of 12,849,998. Hindi and Punjabi are the most widely spoken languages in New Delhi. English is primarily used as the formal language by business and government institutes".Source: http://www. delhicapital. com/about-delhi/fast-facts.html.Just now that I made it clear who gets the stupidity tag here, so how is Delhi representing pan-India again???</comment>

<comment>after Bihar elections let us debate again. It is not me but Honourable PM has said in delhi election that ' jo desh ka mood wohi delhi ka mood' . but unfortunately desh ka mood was different. thanks for saying me stupid.</comment>

<comment>Sure we will debate again. I have not said you are stupid , NOT YET!! You knw that comment was to Gautam Buddha... just not the buddha that I hoped to be :) lolz!!!</comment>

<comment>Laloo cancer hai Bihar ke liye, Nitish said.... so should ppl of Bihar take his word ?</comment>

<comment>Please even u know BJP lost Delhi deliberately to raise Kejriwal's profile as a leader. This is a masterstroke by Modiji and Amit Shah ji towards Congress mukt Bharat. Modiji wants all libtaard sickulars to shift to Khujliwaal which is important to finish off Khangress forever. People need alternative.</comment>

<comment>bahahaha joke of the millennium they lost Delhi deliberately the whole of BJP leadership i repeat THE WHOLE BJP LEADERSHIP was rallying for two months in delhi and still got their a**es handed to them ... you are such a typical bhakt!!</comment>

<comment>if there are 2 party nation wise BJP will loose as it has only 27% votes nationwise and congress mukt is also BJP mukt my dear.</comment>

<comment>You know nothing John snow.</comment>

<comment>but you know everything dear</comment>

<comment>Thanks for acknowledging man.</comment>

<comment>That is why DU students kicked both congress and AAP out of their campus. Good riddiance</comment>

<comment>Yes first choice is always BJP. But if anti-imcumbancy for BJP comes in we need an alternative to Khangress so AAP must take that place.</comment>

<comment>AAP and kejriwal are worse than khangress...atleast congress had 10 % as genuine  competent  leaders  but AAP are bunch of street chimps and bhagoda is the most venomous of them all..</comment>

<comment>yeah atleast they support corrupt practices you mean?</comment>

<comment>AAP are FAR MORE CORRUPT than any other party in history of India.... evaluating their  disastrous performance in just one  year they have broken all records of corruption in least amount of time...added with absolute shambolic governance..AAP even cant handle a small municipality like Delhi...lol incompetent clowns..</comment>

<comment>SURE and you think people are going to believe you just because you(bhakts) say it?</comment>

<comment>Youth of Delhi believed in that..</comment>

<comment>Am sure they did.....</comment>

<comment>Delhi election is still hurting you badly. </comment>

<comment>Awww.   little municipality like Delhi might be huge for brainwashed retards for you but any new party with massive media support could sweep a such a tiny region but now all the sheen and support for AAP has been wiped off..Yes AAP worries me as a nationalist coz they are  bunch of commie , antinational , incompetent  bast@rds ..and youth of Delhi taught them a good lesson in DU elections..</comment>

<comment>aap will win again. now 70-0</comment>

<comment>And LALOO yadav would become head of U.N.O</comment>

<comment>this is what you said before delhi elections also ... you people never learn do you?</comment>

<comment>no yediyuruppa and paswan. if possible vasundhara for female representation.</comment>

<comment>Anyone is better than Laloo....and what wrong have Paswan , vasundhra or yedurappa done..any proof ?</comment>

<comment>yes it is a municipality which uprooted you off your roots. if it were a full state then what would have been your condition? crying for mercy?</comment>

<comment>How does delhi represent pan India? And...."curtailing others freedom, ban philosophy and denying human rights"... care to explain??? Im sure you cannot respond to my questions coz your brain cannot outgrow you thinking process at this moment!! hehehehee</comment>

<comment>Re-postLMAO... what an arse-clown..Retard AAP won due to the 'new' factor...as ppl thought Delhi is a little municipality let give them a chance , but now they have realized their massive mistake..and AAP would struggle to even win 15 seats if elections are held today...BJP retained its 31 % vote share and also destroyed AAP among the youth votes recently in DU ...btw dont forget BJP thumped AAP just few months back before Delhi elections all over the country..

<comment>this is your level of warrior-ship that you were stripped by them without your even a feeble resistance.</comment>

<comment>LMAO... what an arse-clown..Retard AAP won due to the 'new' factor...as ppl thought Delhi is  a little municipality let give them a chance , but now they have realized their massive mistake..and AAP would struggle to even win 15 seats if elections are held today...BJP retained its 31 % vote share and also destroyed AAP among the youth votes recently in DU ...btw dont forget BJP thumped AAP just few months back before Delhi elections all over the country.. ROFLMAO</comment>

<comment>Yes but AAP isnt as anti-Hindu(RSS) as Congress is. </comment>

<comment>this is called true patriotism.</comment>

<comment>BJP will definitely win no matter what sickulars say. BJP has put posters explicitly promising free color TV, scooties, money etc. Nitish cannot afford scooties or color TV no matter how much he tries. </comment>

<comment>when samajvadi govt said this before elections you went to election commission. making fun electricity not av. why distributing laptops. now doing the same thing. this is height of desperation. you do is good others bad. earlier nitish was vikas purush now corrupt. very good</comment>

<comment>When namajwadi party was distributing laptop it was not his money but centres money. Modiji is the PM in center so he has every right to offer freebies as its centers money.</comment>

<comment>very good. do it. corruption does not ends bcos of this thinking. lalu is chara chor but jagannath Mishra is honest, yediyuruppa is honest , paswan is now very good.</comment>

<comment>Mohammed Atta actually was a Brahmin...Nobody knows this...not even FBI...</comment>

<comment>it was the 19 hindus who blew up the WTC....</comment>

<comment>And ISIL is an RSS subsidiary </comment>

<comment>"our vote will not be wasted, it will go to the party that is ahead"Huh? If the party is already ahead and you vote them, isn't that a waste? Bihari Villagers are really.. Well, Bihari</comment>

<comment>just like delhi where 285 MP + 30 ministers and Modi all were humbled by one man only. 67-3. then also same type of comments were coming</comment>

<comment>Put every aspect aside and just consider on one glaring FACT---In last some centuries CHRISTIANITY & ISLAM have been the biggest murderers and butchers of the humanity and they have invaded and conquested almost the entire world , they have obliterated native cults from its roots , but ONLYHindus have given them some resistance and have protected half of our land , although other half has been surrendered to ISLAM..Therefore , think of Hinduism as not any religion but our home and identity , don't save cows , don't build temples but for civilization's sake not let even a single inch drift away from us anymore to the invaders...I am an atheist but a proud hindu....think about it...</comment>

<comment>nahi chalega , hindu - muslim nahi chalega. mandir - masjid nahi chalega</comment>

<comment>Jo India bacha hai...usse bhi PAKISTAN ko dede...dhakkan kahin ke..</comment>
