<comment>यह राजनितिक विरोध, भाजपा नफरत तथा वोट के लिए गट्टर तक की राजनाति करने सी भी नहीं संकोच करेंगे | This is bankruptcy of brain and idea of them and intelligentsia. Tomorrow they will say rape and other anti social acts are within right to freedom of speech and expression.</comment>

<comment>Votes against free water, power and money. The majority is already of Dalits and Muslims who hate Hinduism. Most of the capable minds have left India for US, UK, Australia .... irrespective of cast or religion. We may be following the path of self-destruction.</comment>

<comment>Naxal supporting Communists and Congress ever ready to sell India for graft are hardly nationalists. JNU incident only manifested it. Poor and Dalits being fooled alike Muslims are fooled for the last 60 years is also not surprising. For any sane person Modi Govt. is need of the hour whatever are their shortcomings. JNU, Dalit student suicide ... are all exploited full for anti-Modi politics.</comment>

<comment>Lot of minor a$$holes joining together to become a giant a$$hole and crap on the country.</comment>

<comment>So this author means to say that there is any difference between CPI/CPIM/Congress/JDU/SP/BSP/AAP. We never say that difference. They are all the same. Nothing new about their UNITY.</comment>

<comment>All opposition has only one item in agenda. How make ruckus and harass BJP. I am amazed at the lies and misrepresentation perpetrated by a whole host of political parties. I am not surprised communist students  lying  because they do it all the time.</comment>

<comment>If the opposition wants to unite to protect those propagating India to pieces, I would say then its advantage Mr Modi. There must be Intolerance to anti nationals.</comment>

<comment>Opposition unites in JNU to destroy India. Anti nationals now have a platform on Jawahar's head.  Weed out these so called students and send them back to their homes.  India does not need such tolerances.</comment>

<comment>It is good that ordinary citizens know who went to JNU to support those who are aiming and working for the following:1. Kashmiriyo ladte raho - Hum tumhare saath hain2. Kashmir ki aazadi tak - jang rahegi Jang Rahegi3. Bharat ki barbaadi tak - Jang rahagi Jang rahegi4. Go India - Go Back Go backThe faces of those who were shouting these slogans should be plastered all around the place they live so that India lovers know that they live in their neighbourhood.</comment>

<comment>The opinions on face book and tweeter do not agree with left or Rahul Gandhi and this writer! When was last time Congress and left party were not hand in gloves?</comment>

<comment>Maha Thug bandhan--- a motley group of anti-nationals - sweeping across the political spectrum. A great opportunity for the country to realize how many such groups exist and how they have ruled us as their fiefs for decades!!!</comment>

<comment>Realization against free water, power and money for vote? The majority is already of Dalits and Muslims who hate Hinduism. Most of the capable minds have left India for US, UK, Australia .... irrespective of cast or religion. We may be following the path of self-destruction.</comment>

<comment>Thank You opposition parties for strengthening BJP</comment>

<comment>How shamless can these political parties get.? I can understand that pappu is an idiot and does whatever his Italian momma says but the commies and kejriwal along with his AAPtards are showing their strong antinational colours. </comment>

<comment>The reason all politicians jump in to this is because of the minorities. Our minorities have their loyalty elsewhere, so if you please them in the things they do, they will vote them. terrorists, criminals of these faiths are considered heroes. These faiths hate the majority and they are not proud to be indians. Chritians identify themselves with white europeans and muslims with arab.</comment>

<comment>gr8..thanks for informing us that all opposition parties support terrorist pglets</comment>

<comment>true! a good fallout. Now people know that all traitors are together and no need to analyze individually.</comment>

<comment>This will definitely benefiot BJP. Indian people are patrits, they won;t support anti nationals. By supprting JNU students who organised Afsal guru event and shouted slogans against India, congress has alienated the patriots in the country. Communists have already become like  salt stored mud kettle. the same is going to happen for the congress. Opposition unity is not for the integration of the country, it is for supporting those favouring the disintegration of the country. There fore, the people will whole heartedly support the BJP.</comment>

<comment>Many of us believed that Congress and left were politically opposite. Day by day that myth is losing credibility among public. This will work against left in a serious way both short and long term. It helps the BJP to project itself as the only alternative against the totally discredited left and congress</comment>

<comment>who says Modi is divisive figure? he has united opposition</comment>

<comment>You mean a govt should not act for the fear of so called opposition unity? That is Congress culture.If students of ANY university/college indulge in anti national activities, they must be brought to book.Students are sent to colleges for study.They are free to pursue non academic activities.But not something of this nature.</comment>

<comment>Wat anti national activities are u talking about. Was it not anti national when rss hailed godse as hero and celebrated his death anniversary  as patriot day</comment>

<comment>Shouting " Pakistan Zindabad" or shouting " break up of India" or supporting terrorists like Afzal Guru is anti national - I was talking about THAT.Any problem? Godse was not anti national he was against Gandhiji's policies of Muslim appeasement.</comment>

<comment>Gheesa peeta record?!</comment>

<comment> M D Gandhi in not equal to India.Godse is anti-Gandhi , not anti-national. So do not waste your seconds of your life in typing this as there are no takers of your manipulations.  </comment>

<comment>NO POLITICAL PARTY CAN WIN WITHOUT MUSLIM SUPPORT .................. It is too late now. You all have the blood of I, Emperor Babur and my soldiers who took your Hindu women to their tents in front us when your forefathers watched helplessly from the bushes. Your forefathers' meekness and cowardice is responsible for the high population of Muslims in.... what was once Hindustan. In 1526, my brave and disciplined army of just 12,000 defeated disorganized Indian forces of 100,000 and ruled India for the next 250 years. We burnt temples, took your women to tents.... again and again and converted them to Islam.... and what did you do? You watched from the bushes.... helplessly. You did not fight. That is why you have over 195 million Muslims, almost 18% of India today. They are among you.   No political party in India can win without Muslim support today. Just remember......  how Azam Khan made the U.P. Police look for his missing buffaloes? There was nothing the angry and darpok Hindu majority could do or can do about even today.  They are among you and you will have to listen.</comment>

<comment>He he.... and yet, one Shivaji is enough to carve a hole in the heart of a towering giant called Afzal Khan and give sleepless nights to a "tyrant" called Aurangzeb.</comment>

<comment>Shivaji's father Shahaji was in the employment of my great great grandson called Aurangzeb. Shivaji's son Sambhaji was in Mughul captivity and his eyes were taken out. Sabhaji's son Shahu was lazy and fat who grew up in Mughul captivity.  Now in Shivaji's name Shiva Sena in Maharashtra is exploiting and terrorizing your own people by exhorting money and votes. Mind well.... not a single man in Bal Thackrey's family has ever gone to join the army in any generation but they all are just sitting and doing GRRRR.... in Mumbai at own people. You know how I came from Afghanistan just with 12,000 soldiers and won your large land? .... Exactly because of this reason. Most Hindus were mistreating and killing their neighbors inside and they did not come to fight the enemy. That is the bad Hindu habit.... It is called.... Darpokness... and the Hndu motto is... तुम लधो और हम कपड़ा सम्हलता है </comment>

<comment>The bottom line is...every man of your ilk has two 3 inchers that he can never control ... No matter how many times a day you pray. Just for satisfying that, you would loaf around the world any number of times. Frankly, I see pigs doing the same in the gutters they roam. </comment>

<comment>Epic slap on pig</comment>

<comment> Oh god thats a horrible history. Babur and his army raped the all the ancestors of pakistanis,  bangladeshis and Indian muslims and made them muslims. Thats a very sad and shameful history for Muslims of South Asia.</comment>

<comment>I HAVE A DREAM……. THAT A MUSLIM BOY AND A HINDU GAY BOY WALK HAND IN HAND IN THE STREETS OF DIRTY VARANASI AND THE MUSLIM BOY DOES A HOOCHIE COOCHI ON THE HINDU BOY BY THE FILTHY GANGA LATER..... I HAVE A DREAM TODAY</comment>

<comment>I will free the wife deserter Narendra Modi from the ignorant, multi-God worshiping, polytheist, and primitive religion and convert him to Islam under one God and give him a new name -- Nairuddin Muddi and Jasmilah for Jasodaben. He can have more wives if he wants but I know it is of no use due to the dhokla eating habit since childhood. It is a shame for a man. Nairuddin will shake hands with Oiwaisi and Azam Khan and they will celebrate the next Eid ul Fitr with a beef party where Smriti Irani will do a belly dance at the mujra all night. But remember…. Alcohol is prohibited in Islam...</comment>

<comment>Abbey ---- Islam worships Allah --- who is none other than Lord Shiva. Al-lah is his name in Arabic. So you'll get enough punya just by chanting "Inshallah" but since you keep dreaming about 72 virgins hereafter, all your chanting 5 times a day will only lead you to them (a criminal waste of human potential).</comment>

<comment>Hindu Goddesses in heaven are also tired of meek and useless Hindu Gods. For example, Goddess Parvati is tired of her crazy husband Lord Shiva who does not come home home in the Himalayas for years, does not wear a shirt and even beheaded her own son called Ganapati. She complained and complained to Lord Indra but he said he was not like King Zues. As a meek Hindu king of the Gods, he is helpless. So Goddess Parvati is taking matters in her own hands. She is attracted to the big stud called Mohammed.</comment>

<comment>Well... you seem to be itching to live the life of a beast... So be it. May Parvati grant you the life and orgy of a pig so that you may continue it with gay abandon.</comment>

<comment>If you did even one of the many misdeeds of Lord Ram – dragging wife into a jungle with you, putting her life in danger, not being able to protect her, leaving her alone at home in danger and going to hunt, verbally abusing her, abandoning her, not providing for her, not providing for children, continue the abuse and cause your wife to commit suicide……  you would be sitting in jail in most civilized societies outside India but here you worship him. What does that tell about how primitive, superstitious people you are who continue to worship wrong role models and condone mistreatment of women?</comment>

<comment>You primitive Hindus have 127 crore people in India including men, women, children, sick, healthy, young, old, short, tall, fat, thin, rich, poor, good, bad, honest, dishonest, corrupt, clean, moderate, fanatic, gay, straight, educated, uneducated, backward, modern and the rest........ and you have 33 crore Gods.... That translates into a dedicated God for every 4 people..... that ratio is fantastic... Even Swedish or Finnish high schools, American Ivy League colleges or best customer service in the world do not have so much dedication........... So that question is .... WHAT THE FUKKK ARE THESE GODS DOING FOR 8,000 YEARS?......... Why there is so much misery, poverty and ignorance among their devotees in your cursed land?</comment>

<comment>Unity of opposition would happen no matter what. The opposition realized that they have a chance only when they are united and will unite for every bad and ugly scenarios. The JNU incident in fact identifies clearly who has interest in nation and who has interest in petty politics.</comment>

<comment>rahul can join a  comedy show. he will be a great hit with the audience throwing rotten tomatoes and eggs at him</comment>

<comment>Actually very soon people will be throwing eggs and tomatoes at feku everywhere he goes</comment>

<comment>KEJRIWAL TWEETED..."No anti-national activity shud be tolerated under any circumstances. Those who did it must be identified and punished".......no other "centrist" or "left" parties had guts to say anything like this.</comment>

<comment>Ha ha ha Kejriwals centrist approach.  He does not support antinational activities but will support the antinationalist. Its just like he is against rape but will support the rapist. Kejriwal  just keeps proving what a cheap third rate politician he is. </comment>

<comment>he was the only non-BJP leader to accept that anti-India slogans were there.</comment>

<comment>he took a more centrist approach...</comment>

<comment>There is nothing more political than this. Worst possible comments.</comment>

<comment>I was only trying to make a point that kejri is more centrist a person..do remember he ddnt mind supporting yoga day or consucting yamuna arti and now saraswati puja in delhi..i think thats the right kind of approach.</comment>

<comment>Person just keep the vote in mind can't provide good governance ..kajri is worst type of politician</comment>

<comment>By that count who is bad...till 3 days ago AAP and Congress wanted to take action on JNU but now politicizing it </comment>

<comment>Precisely. this paid congi author wants to tarnish AK and AAP by implying that they are  supporting Rahul and  willing to take his leadership.AK will never be under Rahul as this lowlife is dreaming.  And in which world "Bol Raha hai" means he is making  a thunderous great speech.  Rahul is a dimwit period.AK will never support any anti national activity and  will ensure Rahuland the so called  left leaders are in jail if they indulge in any anti national activity. SInce AK doesnt have police under his control these guys escaped yesterday inspite of their  anti national speeches.How much ever paid articles like this  cannot make the dimwit as leader to AK. AK will eclipse all these guys on his own and come  to power.</comment>

<comment>yup dude....u nailed it...but at the end as they say "satya meva jayte."</comment>

<comment>AK will disappear by 2020.</comment>

<comment>Agree that time will come in 2019 2020.</comment>

<comment>Now all anti nationals, seculars (meaning patently any Hindu), intellectuals (meaning screwed up leftists and sychophant writers) and Award Bapsi ones, seperatisis, Congress (aka Khangress, Scamgress) and their turn coats like Begum Mamta are all united against national, truly secular and patriotic forces. It is now Mahabharat between Good and Bad now.</comment>

<comment>Ya these truly patriotic and nationalistic people celebrated godse death annuversary as patriot day and hailed him as hero and openly supports that seperatist party pdp in kashmir. Real patriots and nationalist they are</comment>

<comment>Failed attemp again ???  Better know that readers are not dumb to take your twisted logics. Stop boring comment readers. </comment>

<comment>all political parties in india are fooling people on one pretext or other,,,,,,,,some are looting india on the name of national unity,,,,,other r trying to loot india on the name of divide,,,,,,,,,,,india need a rule like china..</comment>

<comment>Be optimistic. Trust BJP</comment>

<comment>will not work in india...for two reasons..india is extremely diverse unlike china...and pple here are not that accutomed to leftist ideology or confuscian principles....so there will be a civil war if tried to implent totalitarian govt in india.</comment>

<comment>I worked in 8 countries including USA and back here due to opportunities...India don't need someone like you.</comment>

<comment>Back here due to oppurtunities or got kicked out from all the 8 countries and finally landed in india</comment>

<comment>I am a consultant and still generate 60% of business from those countries and hold their residencies even had opportunity to get their citizenship but renewed residency instead...I understand some well's from and big loser like you thinking like this.</comment>

<comment>Aur sunn saale I still have consulting clients in NA and EMEA  and providing service to them ...I can move there whenever I want. You are well's frog have idea in your filthy mind.</comment>

<comment>Agree...even felt it when I lived in southeast china which is has most liberal views than other parts of china. You have example of USA where if you do it you can get into trouble...example recently when a father reacted to death and has to apologize publicly</comment>

<comment>Anti national presstitudes like the one who wrote the this article are worse than prostitudes since prostitutes are honest and trust worthy while presstitudes are not.</comment>

<comment>Anti-nationals had a free run for quite long time. Time to defeat them has come. Foolish opposition parties will pay for their support to anti-nationals</comment>

<comment>This time the Opposition parties did something very foolish. In my opinion they have completely misread people's opinion on this issue. Especially at a time when the soldiers' martyrdom in Siachen and Kupwara are fresh in people's minds, the Congress, Left, JDU, etc are siding with people shouting anti-India slogans. BJP would be praying for an election immediately so that they can reap a windfall.</comment>

<comment>When were our opposition parties divided when it came to bashing the BJP (or Modi? It is the only issue on which they stand United cutting across party lines. That is their only agenda. It does not require reiteration that the Left parties are Anti-India. Even a child knows. When the Chinese over ran India in 1962, the left parties were the only people who sided with the enemies. They always took orders from either Moscow or Beijing on all issues affecting India. This is true not only of India but in every country where Communist Party functions. For propagating the ideals of Marxism-Leninism, they will sell their own country. If Calling them anti-National has united the opposition now , so be it. The Indian people know the real agenda of the Communists. That is why the leftists have not been able to have a foot hold in this country and have been reduced to a pathetically insignificant force. Even the states  West Bengal and Kerala, once considered the Bastions of Communism in India, have veered away from Marxixt thoughts.. In the birth place of Communism, Russia, those lionized icons like Lenin and Stalin have been denigrated by the people. China, another Communist citadel has adopted market economy making communism irrelevant.Every where Communists are being looked upon as nothing more than street fighters and goons and harbingers of economic doom to the state.</comment>

<comment>If Bharat Ki Barbadi slogan unites opposition then in front of the word 'Traitor' should have their 'family' picture in the Oxford dictionary.</comment>

<comment>left in india is a antinational element ..they don't care abt economy or caste eradication , u can always hear speeches abt Kashmir separatism frm their dias..just read the thoughts of many commie intellectuals</comment>

<comment>The war is for the soul of our nation. called Bharat, and also called Hindustan.Thanks to the tolerance of our Dharmic people, Abrahamics and communists have had a free -run.Dharmic covers(  Buddhists/Sikhs/Vedic/Parsi/Jain/Hindu) Broadly tehy are  called HinduDharmic people philosophy goal is  enlightenment. Its halllamrk is toleranceSome- Corrupt Fascists and Abrahamics take advantage of this.Anti National anti Dharmic, intloerant people have to be faced down .If they unite - so what?.</comment>

<comment>If Freedom of expression allows "Bharat ki barbadi" on JNU, should we also accept Idiotic, Stupid, Nonsensical Statements by politicians like1. "rape is just a small thing"2. Boys are boys3. All muslims are terrorists4. All brahmins are blood suckers5. All dalits are slaves6. All christians are Conversion terroristsetc etc. Will the same commie support these statements in the name of freedom of expression?</comment>

<comment>Bhai pehle 2 hindu bjp ko vote deta tha to ab 10 denge.....pehle ek comrade ko dekhker thukta tha to ab us ko physically assault karuga....that will b the difference ...</comment>

<comment>It's the sad and fearsome face of opportunistic politics.Rahul Gandhi and Kejriwal should have just ask for an impartial inquiry.Now there has to be a massive movement by the docile citizens of India against all anti-national activities,which the Marxist are interpreting as divergent view point and using tolerance as the solution only to mean allowing themselves to do whatever they want.Marxists always considered India to be nations within nations.While there IS diversity,Kalidas's Kumarsambhav DOES mention India's boundaries clearly mentioning Himalay as the northern boundary and great ocean as the southern.However,the most enlightened  ,mature,tolerant,supremely sublime Marxists will insist that Kalidas was born after the British formed India as a nation and laid down railway network which was used by Kalidas to travel from North to South and write the poem.Like cockroaches,Marxists somehow are getting a chance to survive.What a tragedy.</comment>

<comment>Thanks Si91,Suresh,Moksha and raj for up voting me.</comment>

<comment>Desperate stuff indeed! He is seeing attempts of unification of some grand proportions between these dumb parties of the past. Technically these parties are at best individual votes of them and their kins with no great support at all. The attempt to gang up and oppose any efforts taken by govt in national interest actually makes them come under one umbrella - anti national thoughts and ideology. Putting them and their ideology before the nation is the common thing all these parties mean. To hell with all of them. Steam roll all of them and the silly 30000 student of JNU should not think they represent India. They represent even if all of them are same barely anything to bother.. Votes will come by itself when it has to if the govt if focused to do things that are right. And at the moment this is the right thing to do - crackdown and starve these leftists activists.. Stop their funding and keep a track on their activities.. root the weed out</comment>

<comment>Dear author, look at it this way. It may have united the opposition, but it has renewed support for BJP.  It is being seen as Pappu and commies supporting anti-national activities like support for afzal guru, yakub memon and slogans like "hindustan kee barbaadi", while BJP is standing for the unity of the country. There is a sudden endorsement of the current govt. It has also deflected attention from the Vemula case (Vemula's suicide is unfortunate, but the govt crackdown on HCU for anti-national activities was fully justified).Sweet irony - congress party which was a part of independence movement (though not necessarily the reason for us getting it) is now dividing the country !! Pappu bhai, kahan se kahan le aaye tum congress ko.</comment>

<comment>great anti national activity needs any support?</comment>

<comment>Fighting against Trotskyism Leninists say "This is an instance of high-flown phraseology with which Trotsky always justifies opportunism. A “revolutionary struggle against the war” is merely an empty and meaning less exclamation, ........ unless it means revolutionary action against one’s own government even in wartime............... Wartime revolutionary action against one’s own government indubitably means, not only desiring its defeat, but really facilitating such a defeat."Ban communist parties immediately - even if it means bloodshed. What right have communist parties to operate when they for single party dictatorship.=====================================================What is required is first defeat of ideas of equality and socialism [much more so even within BJP]Modi should denounce Gandhiism and Socialism [Vajpayee's formulation was Gandhian Socialism]. Else he is leading India to its greatest defeat ever.Gandhism was selling of his supporters to gain opponents admiration. MK Gandhi sold his supporters to TRY to win over Jinnah and muslims. Modi/Rajnath assured that reservation would not be scrapped to win over reservation caste votes. Gandhi and Modi/Rajnath failed spectacularly.Socialism is legal robbery - which is height of immorality. Reservation policy is murder of merit. Merit and property rights are INDIVIDUAL rights and any MORAL government which is democratic and not of Ocholocracy[mob rule] type IS DUTY bound to protect it.Simultaneously he should ban communist parties. Shed blood. And take sanguinely if some parts of India breaks away --- that is IF the cancer of Socialism + Equality cannot be cured. Free gun laws + Capitalism +Free buying and selling of votes may be required to get huge popular support and break the reservation policy caste vote banks.===============================================================Possibly he may need to shift capital from New Delhi to Nagpur. Even British did it.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Unless size of cake increases by capitalism and India just belongs to people like 1.5 million railway employees whom Rajnath Singh assured that tax payers will pay for their lunch EVERY day[he assured them that no privatization will take place!], people will lose respect, love for India. India will be a word hollowed by socialism and equality. Daily murder of merit takes place by reservation policy.</comment>

<comment>Commies and congis are piggyback riding on local satraps. They're kicking and squirming even from their oblivion where the Indian voter has thrown them. Now they need Laloo, Nitish or Karunanidhi whom they spurned not very long ago. Our highly patriotic Laloo once could not meet madamji in Delhi even after a long wait, and he came back. He didn't even share the dias with congis during recent elections that he won convincingly. Now he has forgiven them. The story is the same everywhere. Now the country is at the mercy of local parties and dynasties and their whims. Even then these fossils not learning.These anti-nationals should be accorded the highest punishment. Don't ever care about elections. Things change on daily basis, and work only counts. </comment>

<comment>Left ideology which has been discarded by those very countries where it took root and prospered thereafter,should now be studied only as part of history.Amazed why these students of JNU wasting their time trying to keep it alive ?</comment>

<comment>Anti national should not be given any political space let them unite people will see that these parties have no real ideology they are mere opportunistic.Whoever lobby for Rahul he has no political future in India.since China-India war Indian know in what direction left mullahs bend for Prayers in their closet.</comment>

<comment>even though not a BJP supporter, i am glad that BJP is doing the right thing here. forget opposition, do the right thing. punish the vermin at JNU.</comment>

<comment>The garbage has to be collected at one place before it is picked up and thrown out. It is happening. Good for India.</comment>

<comment>Ok...So David has peddled his stuff...we read it.Thank youAnd now here is the reality - Rahul bombed yet again. Puerile at best, and incoherent at the least. trademark Duffer.He could not sift fact from fiction, and spoke motherhoods. Most of the people were gagging at what he spoke.I don't know where David was standing and with whom, but I know for sure any male saying good things about rahul must be wanting to be his valentine for today.end of story.end note - congress is 44, and CPI is 1.5 - so that is the "united opposition at national level" for you.David, take it easy man. Go smoke something else.</comment>

<comment>its good in a sense that the left is coming closer to congress ,now the majority community voters in kerala know whom to vote . lets see the left talk anti congress in kerala , and support it at the same time , left has already left the indian political scene barring the vestiges of kerala and manipur</comment>

<comment>haha...this is what you call "glass half full theory"..liked ur optimism.</comment>

<comment>well , so u expect the keralites to follow the pattern, of voting out  a sleaze corrupt , for an outright anti nationalistic , maybe u will be wrong when the time comes calling lets see</comment>

<comment>i m not really expecting anything from kerala...they have been voting on the basis of caste despite being hghly educated...i only liked the way you related both.</comment>

<comment>Not manipur, in tripura.last vestige of left will be Cuba and JNU for some time , before it ends up in dust bin of history.</comment>

<comment>my mistake sorry ,how about north korea</comment>

<comment>North Korea may call itself a communist country,but I personally feel it is a country where entire population so brain washed to owe   blind allegiance to one person from one family, ideology has no relevance. It is a country of Zombies. But keenly observe the actions and behavior of our own Kejriwal. Any resemblance to North Korean leaders behaviour ? </comment>

<comment>like we were by the gandhi gamily only that we were voting and North koreans are not . well khujli is different , he is a  specimen by himself - no comparison , we have seen many eccentric leaders in the world , but he takes the top place .</comment>

<comment>When the entire country is seething with anger, the author saw an opportunity for discredited left, Congress, AAM unity at the cost of India’s honor.  As a blessing in disguise, perhaps, he thought! These discredited leaders will be kicked out at an appropriate time. The day will is not far off when they will repent for associating themselves with ‘Desha Drohis’. Beware the silence of the lambs.</comment>

<comment>These years conversion has become very difficult. That's why this fellow is writing something against the Govt and its actions. Actually it was the congress which executed Afzal. Have some sense David.</comment>

<comment>Paisaa diya usko, aisa pukhatme nahiliktha hai ye.</comment>

<comment>In past three Days FP has published many articles written by these leftist authors claiming to be part of JNU. Noone expects them to write here that they are part of the anti national brigade and how much they hate India as their president Kanahiya is also praising India.  Be happy with your mahagathbandhan of kejri, RG, JDU, Leftists. You have completely exposed yourself.</comment>

<comment>The author wants to give a big picture of these leftist non-entities entrenched in the university through the courtesy of dynasty for the support it received since the election of V.V GIri as president till to date. They made the university a hot bed of Left, Naxal, now religious terrorism added as a flavor. Now it is the bounden duty of the Govt to liberate the central universities from the dynasty propped up left, Naxal, religious terror for ever.</comment>

<comment>Yes, i agree</comment>

<comment>Agree with the Author...Pappu + Khujili will mate and make beautiful new breed of Commie terrorists.They will be sooooo proud of them :)</comment>

<comment>hey, last such male union produced Sabarimala deity, now a source another kind of debate.</comment>

<comment>Having an #tag on afzal guru who was a terrorist shows the mean and pathetic mentality of the author... it's ironic that FP verifies our comments here but neva do the same on these stupid authors</comment>

<comment>Oppostion unity will just make hindu more unite and far away the reach of not only hindus but every patriotic Indian.All rats came to one place to die.</comment>

<comment>The ruling party did not try "to divide the Left by having the JNU Students Union President arrested". The author of this article is so biased he should prefix his name with the title "comrade". These people who do politics in the form of student unions are NOT "students". They are politicians who are doing petty politics. These lefties will never get support in India, no one has time for them, Yechury is obsolete, communism is obsolete and Rahul Gandhi will never become a leader even if God came down to earth and helped him. This is a democracy and in 2014 the majority voted. End of story. These losers will never win but like losers they keep trying.</comment>

<comment>what nonsense ! In 2014, majority voted against the superboy !</comment>

<comment>Stupid author does not know that the anti - national activities like what happened at the JNU are uniting Hindus against the traitor communists and Congis which is more important.</comment>

<comment>Lone ruled Tripura and its youths continues to suffer everyday from chronic unemployment and concerned folks are just happy to mint Govt salary month after month with an excuse of unemployment is throughout country or no infrastructure. At whose cost please ?With a record (highest in India) 25.2% of unemployment Left ruled Tripura continues to bite dust of under-development and non-performance due to state's outdated policies of being anti development and industry without realizing world and India's economy driven by Business and technology.So far it has been about Govt job, salary, subsidy - on tax payers money and mediocre plastic industry for name sake being the focus - which still fails to show hope to lakhs of educated unemployed youths!Need is to bring high end industry and jobs at Agartala having follow up with Industry leaders and setting up required infrastructure on a war footing.With high speed internet and 24/7 power, Can capital Agartala look forward in 2016 to being an IT hub with high end IT jobs for 7 lakh educated unemployed youths of Trpiura ?</comment>

<comment>Thts the trick of commies. Keep the people poor forever, throw some crumbs for votes and carry on. They know the day people become prosperous, commies will be voted out or booted out as the case may be. Congress party also does the same thing.</comment>

<comment>Covert christian David Devadas with his meaningless article...  WTF is opposition unity? bunch of crooks trying to exploit the situation? The ruling party is doing the right thing , those students along with rahul, yechury should be beaten black and blue. Learn to be a F generalist before writing an article. I don't know why FP allows articles on there website which are not justified in anyway.</comment>

<comment>Dear Author, you are trying to romanticize the politics from 30,000 ft of air. Today, the left is irrelevant other than tripura and Kerala and given this fact the govt will try to divide it is romanticizing left's importance in national politics. It is a sheer case where students were shouting anti-indian slogans, which cannot be permitted. just coz they are students, just because they have a right to dissent and just because they are ensconced in the comforts of a plush university doesnt give them the right to indulge in anti-national activities. The definition of anti-national activity can be given any hue or the cause-effect of such activities is subjected to interpretation, however, it needs to be within the parameter of the constitution.Afzal guru was hanged by the UPA govt..so should the current govt allow such activities to take place just coz the decision was of UPA govt..or should the present govt play politics and blame it all on the erstwhile corrupt and inefficient govt.</comment>

<comment>let all the anti national termites crawl out of woodwork and expose themselves.Good for the country to identify all traitor rats</comment>

<comment>What opposition Unity? Kejriwal on this issue is standing on fence. I do not think he has gone out his way to support JNU students. And Rahul Gandhi and Congress are basically fools to have thrown their weight behind these anti-nationals...they will pay dearly for this on coming elections.</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal went all out to Support these antinational, but is too smart, after seeing the public mood, backtracked, check his tweets of all three days</comment>

<comment>I have checked and now u also check them. At the best he is sitting on fence.</comment>

<comment>Khujliwal is a chameleon. And a poisonous one. His vile cunningness makes him more dangerous than pappu.</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal came to your house to tell u what "actually" is there on his mind or are u a mind reader? Otherwise Can you please tell me how he went "all out to support" JNU idiots? He has ordered an enquiry and that is all rite. Basically being a Bhakt u wish "he would support these JNU idiots" . But alas....as u said.. he is too smart..and that is what matters.</comment>

<comment>He is not smart. He is cunning. But his mental issues will get the better of him and he too will expose himself sooner or later.</comment>

<comment>In politics Cunningness and Smartness are two sides of same coin. R u saying Modi is gullible? hell no ! As for getting better of him...well time will tell.</comment>

<comment>Abe davidwa...ye opposition ki unity hi to achhi baat hai...duniya dekhe ke sap newale kaise ek jagah aa gaye hai apni mitti bachane ke lie.....</comment>

<comment>Modi has seen many of these in Gujarat ...writer is thinking too tactically. Useless article.</comment>

<comment>who is modi ?</comment>

<comment>You dont know...Ask your mom.</comment>

<comment>Author is as not sure about the issue...its about India's security not politics or vote counting.</comment>

<comment>author is looking into politics where security of nation is on stack. supporting or opposing anti-national element should not based on politicle loss or gain.last paragraph make me sad, what a pathetic point of view, but its shared by lots of people in india. thats why india have been suffering.</comment>

<comment>What rubbish ! The so-called 'opposition unity' has been the fall-out of Modi getting a clear majority in 2014 LS elections - the first time in 30 years that one party was able to get a majority ! We have been a hugely divided country for way too long, but now there is a sizeable population in the country that wants to rise above divisive vote bank politics. Since this phenomenon threatens the existence of all vote-bankers and the prest*tutes who benefit from such an eco-system, their coming together is but natural !</comment>

<comment>And what happened thereafter in delhi n bihar ?</comment>

<comment>The casteists, communalists and anti- nationals won in Bihar.</comment>

<comment>But ur m😀m won last night.. She crushed my d!ck riding it hard !!</comment>

<comment>It was your own mother you fool. You could not see in the darkness. Ask her. She is still savouring the taste of her own son's fluid.</comment>

<comment>No it was urs she is not bathing as she wants to keep memories till fresh juice is given !</comment>

<comment>I just talked to your mother, my old flame, she confirmed what happened. Apart from the darkness she said she had had a few pegs more than necessary and thought it was I she was with. She said she will drink again and repeat the experience with you. I tried to dissuade her but she said you too wanted it repeated. Why don't you two marry each other?</comment>

<comment>I wll marry ur mother ! She has tight hole !</comment>

<comment>Fulfill your mother's desire. Marry her and do it openly.</comment>

<comment>Exactly - it is called the Mahagathbandhan Syndrome, wherein sworn enemies come together because that's the only way they will survive ! They all benefit - only the stupid voters lose !</comment>

<comment>What is wrong with 70% of India coming together, to defeat right wing loonies who have 30% votes?</comment>

<comment>Idiot bhadva too fooled all by saying he will give 15 lacs of black money to each ! Kania hramdev gay also is now hiding his ugly face ! Saale suar ke pille !</comment>

<comment>Teri maa ko cho.....ne ke liye 15 lakh ka vada tha. Bheji tune?</comment>

<comment>M putting my rod in tight @ss of ur m😁m which she never gave to ur father ! Aaaah its crushing my rod ! Happy valentine day..</comment>

<comment>Eunuchs like you do not have rods. They have holes in which all sorts dogs with rabies dip their rods. Enjoy them on this VD.</comment>

<comment>Ur master n u have 56" ka hole where big black mamba rests !</comment>

<comment>That 56" is his rod which he puts into the holes of like you and it emerges from their dirty mouths.</comment>

<comment>Very well written and argued. The Hindutva loonies are getting marginalised fast</comment>

<comment>shame on you, u call urself as loonies !!! one day perhaps you all retards and this retard author will understand what's anti-national is ....really it sucks to be living with ppl like u around ..</comment>

<comment>BS article by an AAPtard. David Devadas, the christian feels disconnected from the Hindu element of India, why is why he kis singing paeans of minority appeasing parties. But anyway thanks for giving us that great laughing moment when he said that he was impressed with Rahul Gandhi.</comment>

<comment>U replied to ur own comment urself goon ? 😝</comment>

<comment>So be it. Have you heard of "Indraaya Thakshakaaya Swaahaa" ?Indra protects Thakshaka. Before only Thakshaka was to go. Now Indra risks his own existence. If any party sides with them, they all will get erased from citizens' goodwill. Not about Modi or anti-Modi. About having basic awareness and common sense.</comment>

<comment>Opposition UNITY. HA HA HA HA.Now Kejriwal AAP party will UNITE with Congress and fight with BJP-SAD in Punjab.AAP and communist and congress will unite with mamata congress to fight BJP in Bengal.Commie and congi will UNITE in Kerala etc etc</comment>

<comment>Moron AAP is alone winning punjab !</comment>

<comment>Started abusing my brain-washed half-brain! Both Congress and Communists are British made parties and they follow the British definition of Indian Nationality in concurrence with another British Macaulay's doctrine that Indian will remain Indian by skin only and inside they will be as per British-wish. It followed installation of outsider MK Gandhi from South Africa as Mahatma followed by Nehru-Gandhi dynasty and communist party to combat real heroes, Subhash Bose, Ballabh Bhai Patel etc. It followed establishment of JNU and breeding of Irfan Habib, Romilla Thapar etc. Please improve your brain, apply common sense and don't fall prey to these British stooges to redefine Indian Nationality as to be slave of British-Pakistan-Chinese policies.</comment>

<comment>If bhadva is so realstic n national to britain aur uk apni bhain chudane jata h? </comment>

<comment>tera Mako leke bistar ga?ram kor le or ye debate me na ghuske sidha unko leke ke pakistan ja ke bachcha poida korle aur khus ho le. potty ka kira potty me raheke khush ho le.</comment>

<comment>M putting my rod in tight @ss of ur m😁m which she never gave to ur father ! Aaaah its crushing my rod ! Happy valentine day !</comment>

<comment>tera muh kholke ankh bandh karke upar dekh aur tera maka gud?ai ka girta ras chu?s le.</comment>

<comment>kejri ka khujli thik karne ke liye tera jaisa ha?ram?khor ka sewa chahie. uska dan?da se nikalta ras prasad soch-ke chat-le.</comment>

<comment>It also follows installation of Kejri within India. The rapid speed at which Kejri established or installed himself within Indian society again points out its similarity with the installation of British-Mahatma and indicates solid backing of a very powerful/rich sector (read British-type outside forces) to hijack people's real mandate. The backing of paid media to regularly highlight Kejri also proves it unquestionably.</comment>
