<comment>My deepest condolences and congratulations for the poor humble people of Bihar who made great sacrifice of their Children's future in electing Lalu by majority number of seats so that Lalu's kids future is secured. Bihari people have made great sacrifices in past in having Rabri as their CM proxy of Lalu and now Lalu's kids are their leaders.Fodder Scam:In 1996, Yadav was accused in the "Fodder Scam" in which about Rs.4.50 billion (US $111.85 million) were siphoned off from the animal husbandry department. Several reports of alleged embezzlement of money withdrawn from animal husbandry department were tabled from 1990-95. In January 1996, a raid conducted on Chaibasa treasury indicated the siphoning off of funds by non-existent companies. Yadav then ordered an inquiry to probe the alleged irregularities thinking that he can just cover up the probe. However, after a public interest litigation, the Bihar High Court in March 1996 ordered the case to be handed over to the CBI. In June 1997, CBI filed the charge sheet in the case and made Yadav an accused. The fodder scam forced Yadav to resign from the office of Chief Minister and he appointed his wife, Rabri Devi, his successor as the state's Chief Minister.
