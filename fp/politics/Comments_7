<comment>justices J S Khehar and C Nagappan said that "in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case and the position occupied by the petitioners, we are of the view that the presence of the petitioners before the trial court would cause more inconvenience than convenience."inconvenience to who?  gandhis? the sc had a duty to spell it out and it goofed big time.so, when did the courts start caring about inconvenience to the accused with heavily loaded prima facie?matters of small inconvenience can not be grounds for overturning a high court ruling. sc looks not professional.</comment>

<comment>both maa baeta dono jail mai CHAKKI pesengee</comment>

<comment>Congress will now tom-tom that their leaders have been exhonerated and their foolish followers will do roadside-celebrations !</comment>

<comment>Supreme Court only exempted Sonia and Son from personally appearing in future before the judge on each hearing for some obvious reason, but not at all stalling the criminal proceedings in High Court for which Sibal and Singhvi requested the Supreme Court. Not a happy moment for these Gandhies, media shamelessly confusing the people.</comment>

<comment>Ha ha ha... Another sad day for Bhakts & Swamy the Comedian.... Ah ha ha ha...</comment>

<comment>Bhai before making a jackass of yourself in  public article tho padho. FP ke headline pe mat jao.</comment>

<comment>This Justice Khehar seems problematic. He commented very adversely on the Arunachal Gov well before any judgement was reached and before all the evidence was presented. He did not recuse himself during the NJAC hearings despite some issues. Now, he is letting the gandhis off easily. Someone needs to find out if there are any political inclinations behind his actions.</comment>

<comment>Yes,the observation" the position occupied by the petitioners " is intriguing.Does justice depend on the position o f the petitioners?</comment>

<comment>Yes that was really strange.</comment>

<comment>Having Judges as per madam's whims is working finally.. at least to an extent</comment>

<comment>chinese gandhis asked for quashing of trailSC, refused to do sameyet we see stupid headlines like 'relief for gandhis'...wah wah media...</comment>

<comment>Chut1ya hai yeh saale judges, is there a person in India who doubts these a$$holes have been scamming us their whole pathetic lives ?</comment>

<comment>Imagine Modi/BJP in same spot. You will read the headlines "big jolt to Modi", "SC wraps BJP...", "setback for Modi again..."</comment>

<comment>Well said.</comment>

<comment>how is this releief it should slap on their face for SC did not agree to stop the proceedings</comment>

<comment>SC did not exempt them from appearing , or quash proceedings against the Gandhis.They have to appear as and when required by the Court.That is normal, nothing special, applies to  each and every accused.They can run , but they cannot hide.Next will come Gandhi family role in  Ishrat Jahan case, and other Terror cases.</comment>

<comment>So, the Mother-Son duo are paying the FP staff also to sport 'soft' headlines for the article. Very sad!</comment>

<comment>"The apex court bench comprising Justice J S Khehar and Justice C Nagappan also exempted the Gandhis and others from personal appearances, noting their presence in the trial court would cause more inconvenience, than convenience." I am amused at the reasoning from our highest Court. Is the Court talking of the inconvenience Congress is causing on the floor of the houses? That disturbance will go on, Court or no Court.</comment>

<comment>exemption from personal appearance in the Magistrate court for future hearings is unfortunate ...now, how will we say that law is same for rich and poor ???Just like the court was fair in saying that the proceeding should continue .... They should not have been exempted from personal appearances ...</comment>

<comment>Heading should have been " SC refuses to stay criminal proceedings against Sonia and Rahul ". But then how will the media earn big bucks, it can never say anything against the rich and powerful not the dynasty in any case.</comment>

<comment>I wanna see looters behind Bars.</comment>

<comment>Had an identical order passed in the matter of some BJP functionary like Amit Shah, the heading would have been "SET BACK FOR "    ".  THE COURT REFUSES TO QUASH THE PROCEEDINGS. "      " TO STAND FOR TRIAL".</comment>

<comment>I commented for another gentleman's views</comment>

<comment>That the case will go on, that sc REFUSED TO QUASH the case is not part of the headline ???RANDIPAN U WROTE THE HEADLINE???Ack THOO FP !!</comment>

<comment>Gandhis are innocent</comment>

<comment>lol</comment>

<comment>and squares are round</comment>

<comment>, it came with a rider with the court saying that it would be open for the Magistrate at any stage to seek their personal appearance as and when required......The magistrate should call them for every hearing.</comment>

<comment>Then the SC will recluse them from appearing.</comment>

<comment>No magistrate will call them </comment>

<comment>Magistrate has already called them, and they had to appear, after Kejrudin type of nautanki.Supreme Court, has said they will not intervene, and Ma - Beta, accursed in  the 5,000 crore fraud , have to appear in Court  if the magistrate calls them..They have no choice.It is at discretion only of a Magistrate. He/She have supreme control over Ma- beta</comment>

<comment>2 ( trial court and HC Judge) actually HAD called them, Saudi PIG, that's why ma beta had to go to SC</comment>

<comment>Courrupt congress family just got a temporary relief. Dont worry swamy will put them in tihar jail</comment>

<comment>These corrupt congress ma beta and their chamchas should put behind bar. Because they have looted our nation's poor people's money and spending for foreign honey moon trips and their life stylish like Maharajas. These idiots are not allowing to function the parliament and blocking all the development of our nation. SC should look into this matter also. Because these fraud people's expenses and salary etc are our public tax payers money. These people are wasting our country's money. Corrupt congress are totally anti-indians and now a days provoking the students also to create problems in universities.</comment>

<comment>In this very report you write "However, the court said the trial court was free to secure their presence as and when needed"- what does this mean ? its upto the trial court how it proceeds on the case !! sham reporting!!</comment>

<comment>Relief would be when SC would agree to stay proceedings on NH. Instead SC has refused to quash any proceedings and the trial will go as scheduled. Firstpost and IBNLIVE, a perfect example of #soldmysoulformoney</comment>

<comment>The Supreme Court has refused to put on hold the criminal proceedings against the Gandhis and just recused them from personal appearance. This is a major step and in fact a major setback to Sonia Gandhi/Rahul Gandhi!!!</comment>

<comment>Bhakts burning now SC was pious to them when Feku as accquited but now it's paki court and congress stooge </comment>

<comment>did you just escape from zoo, or oh you are a follower of desert sh*t heads</comment>

<comment>Buddhu, only if you used your head would you know that SC has REFUSED to quash any proceedings and trial will go on as scheduled. What can you expect from inter-family bred muzzie though!</comment>

<comment>Sorry, used his what ?</comment>

<comment>Head, but then again he doesn't have one. Good point, Harsh!</comment>

<comment>The trial is still on and this Global Gadha is wanking off like a excited teen.</comment>

<comment>Don't worry, Madam G ! Please appeal to the International Court in Hague, to stop the lower court trial -  I am sure they will support you !</comment>

<comment>Ladoos ordered by BJP are now trashed in trash bin </comment>

<comment>Subramania swamy had constipation yesterday, but he has severe loose motion today...:)</comment>

<comment>Tune wahan se utha kar khaya kya ?</comment>

<comment>Woh amma canteens ka leftover food chori kar ke khaatha hai...</comment>

<comment>SUVAR hai, kuch bhi kha sakta hai ! No, I don't mean Pig ... I mean Self Up Voting Atrocious Rogue !</comment>
