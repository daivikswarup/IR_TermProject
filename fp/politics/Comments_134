<comment>Nitish will defeat NDA wait and see</comment>

<comment>NiKu can be CM if he joins NDA. He should respect [eoples' choice.</comment>

<comment>Analyse the Bihar previous election trends. People are more & more concern about development & law & order than caste factor. Development agenda & profile of candidate will be determining factor in this election,though caste factor can't be totally ignored.The way things are moving NDA may emerge as a clear winner. NDA is desperate to win this election as it will be a sort of referendum for PM's Modi's one year of governance. BJP's victory will strengthen PM Modi's stature in BJP. Any negative result for BJP will weaken not only Modi's stature but also encourage his opponents in party & out side to be more vocal.If mahagatbandhan wins,which is a less possibility,though Nitish Kumar will be CM,the most dominant figure in Bihar politics will be Lalu Yadav & most of the important portfolios in ministry will be grabbed by RJD. If Mahagathbandhan loses,which is a bigger possibility,Lalu has not much to lose as he has been sidelined for a long time,rather RJD will emerge as the major opponent to BJP. Hence it is  a win- win situation for Lalu Yadav.Congress has only to gain as it was a non entity,& if it gains even 5 to 10 seats,it will be face saving for the party & bring renewed enthusism among its cadre & it will give life to the dying party in Bihar.The biggest loser will be Nitish Kumar -both in victory & defeat.In case of mahagathbandhan getting defeat,JDU will get fragmented,cadre will take shelter of either NDA or RJD & may even switch over to Congress.Nitish kumar is very likely to be a lonely entity. It is really surprising how Nitish Kumar with such a sharp political maturity dug his own political graveyard.</comment>

<comment>Amit Shah's tactics are on full play. Money plays a big role in these surveys. Similar surveys were conducted and published during Delhi election too when none of the surveys gave majority to AAP but the result was just opposite as BJP got only 3 seats and AAP got 67. The same thing is going to happen in Bihar election.</comment>

<comment>True</comment>

<comment>No,in Delhi election all surveys had predicted AAP a clear winner.</comment>

<comment>who has written this asinine article? NDA is ahead in rural as well as urban areas as per the poll. Lead is 2 percentage point in rural areas and 20 pc points in Urban areas.</comment>

<comment>in rural india caste stregth plays a big role, in urban space mood of ppl play a big role .......</comment>

<comment>India is cursed forever and will never progress. There is no religion indicating a single point of origin indicating that all are a piece of fiction. Dadri lynching was an unfortunate incident which had to be ignored and left to the law to decide but Media is propagating it to create more problems like and Politicians across all parties are leaving no stone unturned to make sure that it escalates into bigger riots.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately if there's any democracy in india political parties its bjp. Every other party is plagued with family controls ... Congress SP laloo DMK ...  Only in BJP a cm can aspire to become pm. A tea boy can become as powerful as he can get if he is passionate and hardworking. </comment>

<comment>THE TREATMENT OF RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN MUSLIM LANDS, SEPTEMBER 20, 2013 RACHEL MOLSCHKYMuslim immigrants demand that the Western civilization erase its culture and heritage for Islam instead, relying on liberal religious sensitivities as a means to accomplish this. On the grounds of discrimination and Islamophobia, Muslims in the West convince our liberal/leftist society to secularize everything, remove any references to religion like Christmas trees and crosses while at the same time, introducing Islam into the supposedly secular public school system. In addition, they are known to force halal food onto non-Muslims, demand extra breaks during work hours for their five prayer times each day (with full pay), and protest violently if women aren’t granted the right to wear a face veil, as if this is some sort of infringement on women’s rights when it is in fact quite the opposite.There is never any talk of Christianophobia, Hinduphobia, Buddhismphobia, or Sikhismphobia. And while anti-Semitism is most rampant among Muslims than any other group, it is almost always discarded by Muslims as nonexistent or blamed on Israel because after all, everything is the fault of Israel according to the Muslim world.As obsessed as Muslims are with blaming all their problems on someone else, Muslims in the West are equally obsessed with getting their way by crying foul if they don’t. However, with all this talk of religious discrimination, one would think that non-Muslims in Muslim nations must enjoy a wonderland of religious freedom, with plans for new expansive churches, synagogues and temples approved daily and all taller than the mosques already in existence. There must be small chapels in Muslim airports for the Christian flyers much like the Muslim prayer rooms (along with foot baths provided by tax payers) now being added to some Western airports. (The Denver airport has an interfaith prayer room for Christians and Jews to share and a separate one for those super special Muslims.) Kosher food must be provided to all students where there are a handful of Jewish pupils, and Christians must be allowed free reign to proselytize… Right?Well, not exactly. Neither religious minorities who live in Muslim countries nor religious minority tourists or other travelers can expect fair treatment. The righteousness of equality and protection promoted by Muslims is one-sided.The next discrimination is the dress code for women, who must be covered as an Islamic woman and have a male chaperone to meet them upon arrival. Finally, in addition to the typically forbidden items such as firearms on their flights into the country, and some others which can be understandable such as alcohol, pork, and pornography, what is not overtly advertised on their list of rules and regulations is the ban on religious materials such as Bibles and crosses.If a foreign woman marries a Saudi and lives in Saudi Arabia with him, she must have his permission to leave the country. If the woman is not married, she must have the permission of the male head of the household or a male guardian in order to leave the country. No public practice of a non-Muslim religion is permitted and can result in imprisonment (or worse for Saudis), and though it is allowed in private, with the ban on non-Muslim religious materials, Saudi Arabia is not exactly the place to practice any religion other than Islam. Non-muslims are not allowed entry to Mecca or Medina, the Islamic holy cities (despite attempting to lay claim to Judaism’s holiest city).Shariah law is the law in Saudi Arabia, so any religious minority must abide by Islamic law, and the crimes of adultery, homosexuality and apostasy will get you beheaded. Alcohol consumption will land you in prison or will get you flogged. Drug dealers will often get a death sentence. Thieves will typically get one hand and one foot chopped off. If a woman is raped and reports the rape, without four male witnesses, she may be convicted of adultery, which carries a death sentence.This Norwegian woman was originally found “guilty” for getting raped.In Dubai, a Norwegian woman was arrested on adultery charges for reporting her rape.She was lucky to only be sentenced to 16 months, rather than to death.The most recent example of how Muslims treat religious minorities in their countries is that of the Coptic Christians in Egypt. Things got far worse under President Morsi for the Copts when various Christians were being arrested for blasphemy including attorneyRoman Murad Saad who was convicted in absentia this summer and sentenced to one year of hard labor. Several teachers, at least one of whom was accused by her young Muslim students, and even two Coptic children, 9 and 10 years-old were also in legal trouble for blasphemy. But the rise in these cases was nothing compared to theforced conversions to Islam, kidnappings and murders.This is a perfect example of a Christian-majority nation transformed into an Islamic oppression, a warning to Western nations which are providing the means for the same to happen without all the violence and hysteria of the original Muslim conquests. (That is, besides the terrorism, systematic raping of Western women and girls, money laundering, domestic abuse and other spikes in crime which the West seems to take in stride, no big deal.)How about the Muslim treatment of Hindus? The Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent yielded around 80 million dead bodies according to historian Will Durant. There were forced conversions, rapes, tortures, the desecration of Hindu and Buddhist temples, all of which clearly demonstrate how Muslims feel about “religious sensitivities.” Though on a smaller scale, not much has changed since that time.Hindus leave Pakistan for India, fleeing persecution. (Source:http://articles.washingtonpost...The Hindu American Foundation explains the plight of Hindus in Muslim Pakistan:“Non-Muslim citizens of the Islamic Republic ofPakistan are treated as separate and unequal citizens in a form of religious apartheid. The Constitution and laws of the land are overwhelmingly preferential to Islam, the State Religion, and Muslims. Systematic exclusion of Hindus and other minorities ranges from humiliations such that a non-Muslim lawyer cannot appear before Federal Shariat Court to Constitutional provisions that the President and Prime Minister ofPakistan must be Muslims. Religious extremism and fanaticism sponsored by the State that disenfranchise its own minority populations have engendered fringe factions that endanger the wellbeing and lives of minorities, including Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Ahmadiyas, and Shias…”“… Many of the approximately 2 million Hindus in Pakistan are compelled to pay regular sums, as a type of ransom, to extortionists and local leaders in exchange for the physical security of their families and themselves. It is conventional wisdom that no job higher than a clerk’s post may be obtained by a Hindu… Many Hindu temples have been desecrated, destroyed, or converted into government offices in Pakistan…” Illegal encroachments on Hindu temples and lands, molestation and abduction of Hindu girls, demanding of huge ransoms in kidnap cases, and frequent arrests of Hindus on false charges have become commonplace in Pakistan.”The Hindu population of Pakistan, once 15 -24% in 1947 at the time of the Partition, dwindled down to 1.6% as of 1998.This sign points out Muslim double standards.These are but a few examples of how Muslims treat religious minorities when they are in control. No other house of worship can be taller than a mosque. Plans for building new churches or temples are not approved like the multitude of mosque building approvals taking place in the West. Even the renovation of old churches is rarely approved. Non-Muslims are often kidnapped, held for ransom, raped, tortured or killed. They do not enjoy the same rights as Muslims. Simply put, they are discriminated against and often persecuted. Religious freedom for non-Muslims in Muslim lands is nonexistent.Our governments do not discriminate against Muslims, but prejudice against non-Muslims is institutionalized in the Muslim world. Next time a “Western” Muslim claims discrimination and Islamophobia, let’s remember their anti-Semitism, Christianophobia, Hinduphobia, Buddhismphobia, Sikhismphobia and every other “phobia” against all non-Muslims. Religious sensitivities, it seems, only apply to Muslims.By: Rachel Molschky</comment>

<comment>need not bring mulim angle in every issue ;)rss themselves are arranging iftaar party, media is the culprit here</comment>

<comment>I didnt. You did. RSS arranges iftaar party or muslims celebrate Deepavali is not my concern. What matters is why does media and all muslims bring that muslim angle in everything. Look at the comments. All muslims are doing is showing that after dividing India and staying in India as unwelcomed guest after getting their pound of land (1/3rd land to 1/10th population they muslims took) and even after multiplying in Hindu majority India from 5% to 20% today they only complain and support people like Owaisi and Azam Khan. How long can Hindus suffer at the hands of muslims?</comment>

<comment>even section of muslims hv started giving approval fr NDA ...................i bet section of yadavs and kurmis too will vote fr nda ...these two are bastion fr rjd and jdu ................mahabhandhan will be in for a shoker at the  time of results,their unholy alliance has never got a approval .................</comment>

<comment>Keep day dreaming.</comment>

<comment>mood trickles from urban india to rural india , just wait at the time of results bjp will win with great numbers...............uran bihar solidly behind bjp...........noone is an idiot every one knows what kind of alliance is this ............</comment>

<comment>WARNING: Non-Muslims are strictly prohibited from entering the city ofMecca. The penalty is deportation from the country. Documentation will be checked upon entry and anyone not showing proof of being Muslimwill be denied entry</comment>

<comment>Mahagutterbandhan in for a tight slap from ppl of Bihar...even Indian Express says 4% gap...on the ground it must be much more than that</comment>

<comment>modi yei to start fr final push- stil 4% gap- oh my god at end it will be 6% - that mean two way contest - 6% gap will be landslide fr nda- 150-160 seats.</comment>

<comment>"The poll added that the BJP is preferred in urban constituencies, while the Grand Alliance is a favourite of urban constituencies."EH?!</comment>

<comment>I am failing to understand why no political party is informing the public on the conviction of Lallu Prasad Yadav, and how Nitish is in the company of him</comment>

<comment>Nitish has no number to run legistative assembly and to continue as CM. He has to depend on Laloo.</comment>

<comment>isn't that what BJP doing in all its rallies?</comment>

<comment>fr real domination - winter session very imp fr bjp in parliament- gst real estate bill need to be passed- that's the reason modi final push to get 160 seats fr nda and to complete destroy of opp</comment>

<comment>oh i am not listening to it much, we need to Block them out from poltics ( Lallu , Nitish) Etc</comment>

Then cast your precious vote don't just follow the senseless routine, wake up!!!</comment>

<comment>I only hope that when BJP wins power in Bihar, they will act swiftly against the Ranvir Sena who have done innumerable criminal acts against the lower caste.</comment>

<comment>Are you in a mood of jest or satirical, which I hope is the case !?  Ranvir Sena indeed has the covert support of BJP and you may be right in a sense that this party's ascension will slow down their atrocities against the lower castes.  So, it is just terror let loose like elect us or face the consequences !?</comment>

<comment>Dear voter friends in Bihar - Please remember - No vote for BJP until the last paisa of trillions of crores of stolen black money comes back into the country. BJP had promised YOU in its Lok Sabha Elections but today is running away from it. Not only running away, your money is wasted in foreign trips by Modi. And the foreigners are giggling at the back of him. Remember it is YOUR money that was stolen. Even today BJP has all the powers to recover the money and send the chors to jail RIGHT NOW - Income Tax Department, Enforcement Directorate, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of External Affairs, RAW, Police, CID, CBI, STF, Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, EVERYTHING. Even today they are fooling you saying Damad made 1000 crores, Beta made 500 crores. Ok, Damad made 1000 crores, Beta made 500 crores, but what are they doing? Swatting flies? You mean if all the above said powerful bodies are under BJP, then why isnt even one rupee of black money has come back and no one has gone to jail even after BJP has been in power for 2 years? ARE THEY ALSO HAND IN HAND WITH Damaad and beta? Think about it. Vote for BJP only if YOUR money is back. Vote for any other party. except BJP. The age of promising lies is over. Vote for the right candidate. Pls do not keep your mind on one or two parties. Exercise your judgement before voting. BUT PLEASE NO BJP.If some conmaster says bringing black money will take time, tell the crook, your vote for BJP will also take time. And that is after ALL YOUR stolen money comes back.</comment>

<comment>are you mr d vinayprasad</comment>

<comment>Actually they are bringing large amounts back. Plus people are currently on trial.</comment>

<comment>Its only Hawabazi didn't you heard Man ki baat even Feku doesn't how much black money is there abroad</comment>

<comment>ok dear someone is trying. You know something, almost all the folks in that party have tonnes and tonnes of black money. BJP has refused to answer your query where they got the 5000 crores during the LS Elections. You think they will "bring back" black money? Come on, lets not fool ourselves.</comment>

<comment>Wow very nice</comment>

<comment>Yes, instead of voting for BJP which is taking time to bring back black money, vote for the people who looted and generated the black money in the first place....LOLHeight of gadhagiri..</comment>

<comment>Who should we vote for then? </comment>

<comment>Candidate is more important than party. So many good candidates stand for elections, they loose deposit. Do not have either / or BJP or Nitish or Congress in your mind. Please go through the background of the candidates in your constituency.</comment>

<comment>you are a fool.. its the leadership that matters.</comment>

<comment>even I am a BJP supporter.. but I am 100 % agree with u.. we should go with candidate..</comment>

<comment>Media makes it an issue of Modi's prestige and Modi wave in each election from Mah,  har,  jhk,  Delhi it was always about him and his MOST importance test till now :)Having said that  for bihar & India ( rajya sabha seats) it will be great if NDA wins</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Modi comes fron a low caste. So stop spreading lies.</comment>

<comment>lol</comment>

<comment>BJP will probably win, it is all for the good, though. In Power, BJP will be under more media scrutiny than ever before. Look at how one Dadri incident has now been splashed all over the world. The opposition to BJP should learn to lose gracefully.If on the other hand BJP loses, the insecurity will rise, Ranvir Sena might get a boost, more and more riots and communal incidents can occur. The society might become divided along caste lines, not just religious lines. BJP in any case will not be able to remove reservations, so lower castes have nothing to worry.</comment>

<comment>There is a news about sting on love jihad which seems to be false as no big news channel of India is showing this.Very few news channels are showing this which are not very credit worthy</comment>

<comment>Whoever wins Bihar elections...pleasemaintain status quo in Bihar. We Delhiites are heavily dependent on cheap and continuoussupply of Bihari labor force...I have 10 Bihari laborers working in my workshop...ourtoilet cleaner, car cleaner, sweeper is also from Bihar...The best part isthere are 2 FULL SERVICE Bihari maids at home, which are replaced every 6months so that it doesn't become boring.</comment>

<comment>Lalwaniji ... I manage the offshoring business for raj Thackeray. Can place a few Biharis on contract if you want. We have excess supply and utilization problems.</comment>

<comment>We don't take 2nd hand stuff...Only fresh maal straight from the oven.</comment>

<comment>Its very sad to see that there is not even a single mention of what party will do after winning election or what's their policies. Its all about which caste will vote for which party..</comment>

<comment>what else can you expect from Indian media ? they are hell bent on caste based analysis, even when Indian society has moved ahead of caste, media is sitll fixated on caste.anyways, you go and search on google for BJPs vision document for Bihar, it was released few days ago.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>yes, I meant the survey was not conducted on how people will vote because of the party policy For e.g X% of people will vote because certain policy of party. Dont we have any single policy other than caste which will swing the votes</comment>

<comment>Read the survey in IE , they asked all questions , FP reported what they felt most important</comment>

<comment>this means tat voters haven't matured to ask this question  so politicians are happy with same old divisive politicshowever  if this trend continues  it will be disaster for the economy of the countrywe need investment for growth -centre can try to bring investment  but ultimately  the project the money goes to state ---with such half educated corrupt ,thugs like lallu/mulayam  sitting in states noone will  bothereither  people start voting on basis of development   else the country is going back to the 80s</comment>

<comment>Same old story of Delhi election is being repeated...</comment>

<comment>No one will get 95% seats like AAP in Bihar </comment>

<comment>even AAP will not get 95% again in Delhi.. one was just a trial run for people to understand and get fooled !!</comment>

<comment>Who told u that ? People get fooled after voting BJP not AAP first time in history of India No power hike in Delhi in 8 months of AAP gov</comment>

<comment>Even BJP will not win again in 2019 or 2017 election of Gujarat </comment>

<comment>Gujarat is gone for BJP...Modi made a big mistake by appointing that lame duck lady as Gujarat CM.</comment>

<comment>She is more corrupt then Lalu</comment>

<comment>Lalu was corrupt but not idiot...This lady is corrupt, idiot, and arrogant.</comment>

<comment>ur talking as is u know anandiben personally</comment>

<comment>Somen-dada,You are lucky that you have a patriot like Mamata-didi as your CM. Gujarat has gone to dogs ever since anandiben became CM...She has taken away "ANAND" from 6 crore Gujaratis. Today, Gujarat has come in the ranks of backward states like UP, Assam, Tripura, Odissa, etc.</comment>

<comment>mamata didi is another useless fellow</comment>

<comment>Somen-dada,Being a Bengali you should not say such things...Such lady is born once in million years...She is a pure patriot person. She will not think for a second if she has to die for Bengal...Consider yourself lucky that she is governing the state.</comment>

<comment>she is even worse than communists</comment>

<comment>She should marry a Imam and enjoy practicing Islam leaving entire Bengal converting Islamic state.</comment>

<comment>thats why bengal is fast becoming saudi arabia. thanx to didino investors interested in bengal, tatas thrown out, bengali ppl r forced to migrate outside for jobs and education</comment>

<comment>I am not sure what you mean when you say Bengal is fast becoming Saudi Arabia...Saudi Arabia is one of the richest countries in the world...If Bengal is also becoming richer like Saudi Arabia, what is wrong? I would suggest you go through the details of previous investor meet in Bengal..Results were fantastic. Bengali people migrate outside for learning, getting exposure and spreading knowledge. Nothing wrong in that. There are millions of non-Bengalis living in Bengal today...I would rate Calcutta as one of the most cosmopolitan cities in India.</comment>

<comment>only going through kolkata wont work kabhi aaiye dehat bengal mein, how ppl r living</comment>

<comment>Sir, I assume you work in IT industry...DO not see rural India with your IT lifestyle lenses...People in rural India have very different needs. They are happy and satisfied with what they have.</comment>

<comment>sir, i told saudi arabia in the sense of islamic fanaticism. bengal is becoming hotbed of islamists</comment>

<comment>Sir, there are lots of rumors about this. Don't believe them. The latest census data shows there is hardly any increase of Muslim population in Bengal. How can it become hotbed of islamists? Please note that our constitution is secular in nature.</comment>

<comment>Same old dialogs... You have nothing to support you other than one Delhi elections </comment>

<comment>he dint calculate the AAP's LS win %....lol</comment>

<comment>Nitishkumar is very nice and honest person but I don't understand why he contesting election with Lalu </comment>

<comment>just like so many very nice and honest people got trapped with tricks and Ploy's of ur own AK47</comment>

<comment>As per 2014 ADR report during LS elections, BJP haf 33% MLAs convicted in serious crimes like kidnappings, extortion, etc. Howrver, 15% of these were convicted of heinous crimes such as gang-rapes, murders, robbery cum murders, etc.</comment>

<comment>ok...why 3 MLA's of non-corrupt (in their own words only) party are in Jail Now??</comment>

<comment>fake certificate distribute  co. give ur honest certificate 2 ur  yeda  cm...</comment>

<comment>Modi had given certificate to Nitishkumar in 2006</comment>

<comment>means u treat modi better than nitish !!! Good !!</comment>

<comment>I don't understand why he is taking support from Kejriwal either</comment>

<comment>Because honest person can take support of Kejriwal not sabir Ali , paswan , Jitendra Don , Mhanji and PDP</comment>

<comment>Hah! back with honesty certificates. from Tomar university? or is it spamnath wife beating school? Some law minister.</comment>

<comment>But no one has corruption charge </comment>

<comment>Lol! if fake degree racket is not corruption, what else is? Don't keep parading AAPtard logic. We know AAPtards have no logic.</comment>

<comment>what about 500 crore media budget? whose pocket is it going to fill?..this is a visible corruption...is it anything apart from business for ashutosh...cobra knows how to collude with channels and engulf money....their is a surge in cobra posts since then...AAP also washed hands in shrad pawar led #AAPScamsOnion....recently.....sisodiya is a biggest earner in this govt..</comment>

<comment>No one has corruption charges in AAP because no one was in power before</comment>

<comment>Good start for my day. Rolling on the floor laughing.</comment>

<comment>May be somnath too</comment>

<comment>Yes he is not corrupt</comment>

<comment>he is not a leader too !!</comment>

<comment>HAHA good one.... LOL</comment>

<comment>Whoever wins Bihar elections, no one can match AAP's fete in Delhi...67 / 70 seats...that's more than 95% strike rate that we are talking about. Even dictators like Saddam Hussein, Col. Gaddafi, Assad Bashar, Fidel Castro didn't get such mandate whenever they went  to polls...Just SUPERB!</comment>

<comment>Excellent comparison - we are already seeing another Dictator gaining muscle by leaps and bounds</comment>

<comment>Bjp won 7/7 seats in Delhi ls elections </comment>

<comment>How dare you rebut an AAPTard with facts!!</comment>

<comment>we are seeing what is happening in AAp's govt in delhi. People are regretting for their votes on AAP.</comment>

<comment>u mean kujliwal also is going to die like saddam, gaddafi ?? LOL</comment>

<comment>Although Kejriwal is not openly supporting any party in Bihar, it seems it is Nitish who has finally got Kejriwal's blessings...AAP workers campaigning shoulder-to-shoulder with JDU volunteers in Bihar...Difficult to understand Kejriwal's game plan...the man is just too smart for laymen like us.</comment>

<comment>Yes, nice, honest, naïve and innocent people will never understood him and got trapped with tricks and Ploy's of  AK47</comment>

<comment>yes u are really a layman to understand kujlibaba</comment>

<comment>And Ranveer sena for BJP</comment>

<comment>Just watched Arvind Kejriwal's talk thismorning regarding Bihar elections. Kejriwal ridiculed these surveys saying thatthey are mostly conducted by fresh graduates and interns who do not have muchidea of how things work. These graduates call up few friends and their familiesand collect responses. Many times, these young graduates are radicalized andfudge the surveys for pleasing their masters. Kejriwal further said that thesesurveys should be torn and thrown off in dustbin. Giving his own example,Kejriwal said that none of the surveys predicted AAP getting Himalayan majorityin the Delhi elections. It was only Kejriwal's wife Sunita Kejriwal who kepttelling him that AAP will get at least 60 seats. Kejriwal said that electionsin India are becoming Presidential like elections in US where people vote for aparticular person and not a party. He gave some interesting examples. He saidthat people actually voted for Modi rather than BJP in last loksabha elections.Similarly, people voted for Kejriwal in Delhi elections. Other strongpersonality cults who single handedly won elections in the past are Jayalalitha,Mamata Banerjee, Sharad Pawar, Mayawati, Akhilesh - Mulayam duo...When it comesto personality, Nitish is a far stronger personality than Sushil Modi andShatrughan Sinha. In fact, 30% Biharis do not even know who Sushil Modi is! Kejriwalsaid that he is not supporting anyone in Bihar elections, but he hopes that themost popular, clean, and strongest candidate becomes the CM.</comment>

<comment>Maza ma Hardik su kare Che Gujarat ma?</comment>

<comment>Hardik is quickly becoming irrelevant...he was Media's creation..Kejriwal shouldn't have supported him.</comment>

<comment>No surprise...In many of opinion polls conducted by Yogendra Yadav and his media cronies before 2014 elections Pappu Rahul Gandhi was the top choice for PM post followed by bhagoda Kejriwal.</comment>

<comment>Modi Magic does not work against Kejriwal it's only works against Lalu Kalu and Pappu </comment>

<comment>Modi defeated Bhagoda by more than 380000 votes in Varanasi....you people were sleeping at that time?.</comment>

<comment>That was saif seat of Modi . And modi won because of fake voter </comment>

<comment>No surprises with supporters like you and your lousy logics that idiot still lives in a Utopian world....get well soon</comment>

<comment>I don't think so...the real reason is, the electorate was divided on the communal lines for narrow political gains.</comment>

<comment>NDA get more seats...NItish merge with BJP and become CM...this is final</comment>

<comment>Nitish always chooses wrong company. He chose Congress when everyboy shunned it, and did badly in lokshabha polls, and now a convicted man.</comment>

<comment>"Vikas" is the biggest Jumla of this decade the previous one was "RAM MANDIR" of the 90's i am still waiting for Bharatiya Jumla Party's action on RaM Mandir</comment>
