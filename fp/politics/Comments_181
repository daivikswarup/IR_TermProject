<comment>Stop migration of bhais from Bihar..Even Nitish Bimaru kumar is 50% successful in doing this then other Indian cities might have a faint chance of survival!</comment>

<comment>बिहार ने देश को PM दिया, अब लग रहा है Opposition Leader भी देगा</comment>

<comment>Such lies and ho ho news not going to influence voters, voters need bread,butter,electricity,water,road,schools,hospitals and Job opportunity, what do these news have to do with that, just creating a hype,</comment>

<comment>Pseudo-secular journalists are openly lying by accusing Gen. V.K.Singh of comparting Dalits with dogs. If I were VK Singh I would turn around and say - "I was referring to pseudo-secular journalists"! Pseudo seculars are playing communal card[casteism is also communalism]My main argument is either all are communal or none is communal.Look at constitution itself..India is a Ocholocracy [rule by the mob, example reservation policy; casteism is also communalism and of a worse kind as stable vote banks are formed - which has led to emancipation from democracy of political parties and state] led by the mafia [till recently we had a genuine Italian one]. IT IS A SHAME TO CALL INDIA A DEMOCRACY.Pseudo-seculars brainwash that1)Opposite of communal is secular.2)From Point 1, Logically then opposite of Individual must be religious - anabsurdity. Hence statement 1 is absurd.3)The correct antonym is Opposite of communal is INDIVIDUAL and opposite of secular is religious. Individualism comes only with CAPITALISM -positive spinoff of selfishness and profit.4)Therefore by almost Iron logic of Euclid either ALL are communal or ALL are not communal. It depends on how much India is capitalist[free economy].5)The fundamental RED communalism is therefore division between Bourgeoisie and proletariat - impeding growth of capitalism and Individualism.Reservation policy and socialism is the reason why if I were the president ofIndia, as owner of public sector banks, PSU would HANG MYSELF in abject shame. The origin of black money is constitution itself. Socialismwas introduced into constitution during emergency. It is by definition legalrobbery(as distinct from charity). Obviously objective of communists is civilwar - therfore BJP/RSS should go for all out privatization. In order to counterthe backlash, introduce free gun laws which can be very popular to fetch votes.Make buying and selling of votes legal to shatter the vote banks</comment>

<comment>The mandate in 2014 general elections was for Narendra Modias Prime Minister. More than the opposition parties BJP and associates seem tobe making it tough for Mr.Narendra Modi. eg.Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, Akali Dalin Punjab. To win state elections you have to let a strong local leadershipevolve and take charge. Congress by following the central leadership formulastands decimated only because they did not allow state level leaders to riseand flourish. Narendra Modi and his advisors should have enough confidence inthemselves to let local leadership perform and flourish. The BJP ruled statesof Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Rajasthan have strong chief ministers whohave won on the basis of their performance and not because of any strongcentral leader. Mr.Narendra Modi making himself out to be the central figureeven in state elections will only isolate him even within his own party. Goodtimes do not last forever, and when dark clouds do appear, the question to askis, who will stand by Mr.Narendra Modi even within the BJP??</comment>

<comment>nitish babu is one of the best real politik politicians in the country. This man has the skills!and good article BTW. we need this kind of analysis, not the sh!t that gets posted here everyday.</comment>

<comment>The entire entrenched society is trying to give their worst fight with their back against wall. Cornered like rat they are trying to hit out at now else they know they would not be able to wriggle out for ever.Interesting and concerned about the result.</comment>

<comment>Almost 2/3rd of seats are yet to go for polls. Whether he outsmarted or got outsmarted will be known soon, in few weeks. Its not BJP or Modi, its Bihar which will lose if people like Lalu com to power.</comment>

<comment>True, just like the people of India have lost since Modi came to power last year</comment>

<comment>People of India only gained after Modi came to power, look at development, jobs, economy, infation & infrastructure, security, people are happy, small incidents cannot negate far better achievements</comment>

<comment>how do you know people are happy?</comment>

<comment>yes I know, you can do a survey</comment>

<comment>how do you know?</comment>

<comment>Hw do u know ppl of indiahv beem d losers since modi cane to power?</comment>

<comment>You made a claim. You have to explain it.</comment>

<comment>Yes, and as if people were winning since last 65 years when Congress was in power. Thats why India is considered as poor as sub-saharan Africa.</comment>

<comment>"Since Modi has come in, health has completely vanished. India is on the edge. If PM Modi does not tackle health, India's economy combined with rising population is not sustainable. For India, health is an issue of national security. The government cannot protect the sovereignty of its nation, cannot ensure sustainability unless it has a healthy population. At present Modi has done nothing much to tackle the challenge". --- Lancet's editor-in-chief Richard Horton</comment>

<comment>I hope you know that the Modi government has drastically slashed the health budget, not the best way to make a dent in poverty</comment>

<comment>RSS-BJP ? So, Vatican-Congress and Ford-AAP ?</comment>

<comment>That's a laughable comparison. Just because Sonia Gandhi was born in Italy, doesn't mean she is from the Vatican. It just shows your extreme ignorance. On the other hand the BJP's top leadership, PM and Amit Shah downwards, are all extremely loyal members of the RSS. And they say so themselves. Ford-AAP is not even worthy of comment.</comment>

<comment>So big deal if they are members of RSS. Is it illegal to be member of two organisations ? I even admit BJP is a unit formed by RSS. But you still can't call it RSS-BJP. The organisation which has won the elections and has formed the government is BJP.</comment>

<comment>RSS-BJP is just a matter of detail. The Sangh parivar actively supports all election campaigns of BJP. Modi and Amit Shah themselves will be very happy with the hyphenation.</comment>

<comment>Whatever it is, it is not RSS-BJP. It is only BJP. There are many other organisations which actively support it and of which some BJP candidates could be part of. You can't put all of them with an hyphenation.</comment>

<comment>You can write whatever you want now. Nitish is winning the Bihar. You know it. No one will vote BJP if the Dal is 210 rs per kg.</comment>

<comment>4 Sunni Muslim Groups Responsible for 66% of All 17,958 Terror Killings in 2013 By Patrick Goodenough | November 19, 2014 | 4:38 AM ESTThe number of people killed by terrorists worldwide in 2013 rose by 60 percent compared to the previous year – from 11,133 to 17,958 – with four Sunni Muslim extremist groups responsible for two-thirds of all fatalities, according to a comprehensive annual study.Eighty-two percent of fatalities occurred in just five countries – Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria, although the number of countries that experienced more than 50 terror-related deaths also rose – to 24, compared with 15 the previous year.The report also found that Islam as a “religion” as a driving ideology for terrorism has jumped significantly in the last five years, and accounts for most of the terror activity in the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.As a driver for terrorist groups, Islam as a religion far outstrips “politics,” which tends to dominate attacks in the Western Hemisphere and is responsible for about half of them in Europe.</comment>

<comment>Hallo RAMMADHAB/ Rakesh Sinha, suva dshera in advance</comment>

<comment>What do you think is a solution to tackle the falsehoods spread by proJIHAD Indian media ?</comment>

<comment>In last 10-15 years, while all over the world Christians and Muslims are fighting like dog and cat in India they got together under Sonia to turn India into a jihadi territory so that they can divide India once again. Christians dont care as long as they get few Christian states and muslims were doing the same what they did in 1947. So the first thing was to get money from ISI and Saudi Arabia and infiltrate the media and Bollywood. Few Hindus like Pranab Roy or Mahesh Butt were paid by Dawood so that they can sell their soul to the devil. Now this group of jihadi movie producers and media editors started to show that Hinduism was bad, Christianity and Islam was good (while 99.999% of terrorism was spread by muslims). Today 80% of media is controlled by these jihadi elements.So the only way to tackle this falsehoods is to use social media to reach people (who are Indians first and anything else second), ignore the media which is controlled by christian missionaries and muslims and write back to them when they spread false stories. Nothing is wrong when they show Islam or Christianity in good color but how come the color changes when it comes to Hinduism or Buddhism?</comment>

<comment>"India they got together under Sonia to turn India into a jihadi territory so that they can divide India once again.", unfinished job will be done now under guidance of USA</comment>

<comment>Best of luck. 90% of Indians don't use social media.</comment>

<comment>I know you are challenging us to bring out the truth and fact but its ok your brothers in ISIS have used social media even though you thought talibani dont use social media. So you keep thinking Indians dont use social media and let us do our job.</comment>

<comment>I simply stated a fact. Look up the social media penetration data in India. You think Bihari voters are following social media?</comment>

<comment>Bihari voters are still Indian voters. I dont want to talk about Bihari or non Bihari or Sunni or Shia. All are Indians.</comment>

<comment>‘Ā’ishah bint Abī Bakr (613/614 – 678 CE; Arabic: عائشة‎ transliteration: ‘Ā’ishah [ʕaːʔiʃa], also transcribed as A'ishah, Aisyah,Ayesha, A'isha, Aishat, Aishah, or Aisha /ˈɑːiːˌʃɑː/ was one of old man prophet Muhammad's child wives. In Islamic writings, her name is thus often prefixed by the title "Mother of the Believers" (Arabic: أمّ المؤمنين umm al-mu'minīn), per the description of Muhammad's wives in theQur'an.The majority of traditional hadith sources state that child Aisha was married to Muhammad at the age of six or seven, but she stayed in her parents' home until the age of nine, or ten according to Ibn Hisham, when the marriage was consummated with old man Muhammad, then 53, in Medina.</comment>

<comment>The incidents which used to get a tiny brief mention in blurred fonts of news tickers zapping by at bottom of the NEWS TV screens , are now intentionally given sec by sec super detailed 24 x 7 coverage with an exhaustive reportage covering emotive elaborate accounts of ‘horror’ by the victims and images to spice up the tragedy to the grisliest level ….. !HARYANA , grow up you stone-head bast@rds .For how long you caste baboons would eat India alive inch by inch. Although that was my general advice , as the present case of ‘Dalit’ murder has more to do it with ‘Personal feud’ than the casteviolence but Media continuing with its policy of blood-lust gorilla war against BJP has bumper-exaggerated this incident too…( P.S My heart goes for little babies deceased and culprits should get the most severe punishment possible under law)Coz , such similar and sometimes even far more gruesome murders during the times of Congress or NON-BJP states , were never even able to reach the DUSTBINS of the News studios but now they would be milked , stretched and skimmed off to the extent until the places which are presently calm also get infected by this ‘Sponsored’ turbulence…BJP NEEDS TO BLOODY BUCK UP , TO COUNTER THIS ‘MILITANCY’ BY MEDIA AGAINST THEM… ! and KHATTAR seems to be a very naïve and NON-political CM ever… even I can handle media better than him..</comment>

<comment>baba in which country are u staying? posting at odd hours</comment>

<comment>The Congress party made India like more pitiable than the worst among African nations.  The author must be constantly reminded about that in view of the fact that Bihar was worse than any of the African republics by an order of magnitude. It is beyond comprehension that the article is praising the strategies of Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav, and denigrating Narendra Modi.</comment>

<comment>During last elections in Israel, Left-Centred groups along with their political mentors outside the country and their media counterparts,  tried to create an environment in which they would discourage the core Nationalist voters of Israel to come out and vote. This was their idea of defeating Benjamin Netanyahu. But Netanyahu saw through the conspiracy and appealed directly to the patriotic voters of Israel to come out and vote in large numbers on the day of the voting. And Netanyahu won eventually. Similarly today, a whole bandwagon of lies and misinformation is being preached by certain media groups to discourage NDA voters to come out and vote in the upcoming phases of Bihar election.Some 160 seats are to be polled for elections in Bihar.  Of these 160 seats, in next 3 phases, in some around 120 seats NDA is supposed to do very good. So this is a deliberate  effort to create a feeling of despair, gloom and despondency. But "Bhagvad Geeta" says----"Karmanye Vadhikaraste, Ma Phalesu Kadachana". NDA voters should do their duty and do not think of the results. They should come out and vote heavily on polling day. Bharat Mata ki Jai! "Satyamev Jayate"!</comment>

<comment>Modiji was elected PM of India and no one else like Advaniji or others were able to bring BJP back to power...in fact, BJP lost 2 elections to Congress hijacked by Nehru-Gandhi-Khan family and a white fascist mafia Christian fundamentalist Sonia. So you think it was Sonia who defeated Advaniji or Modiji has to accomodate a looser?</comment>

<comment>Only those dalit/backwards "purified" themselves by either joining RSS/BJP or allying with them can rule. If any dalit/backward rule independent  of RSS/BJP, then that rule will be Jungle Raj.  Who invented this theory? are there such intellectuals in RSS/BJP?</comment>

<comment>Only those muslims "purified" themselves by either joining ISIS or Taliban or Al quieda or allying with Sunni muslims can rule. If any non-sunni muslim rules it will be a jungle raj. Who invented this theory. Are there such intellectuals in Musselman community?</comment>

<comment>Really, where are you from?</comment>

<comment>Only Kshatriyas or a dalit/backward co-opted and "made Kshatriya" by RSS can rule. Remember how S Swamy made Modi a Brahmin. This Jungle RaJ phrase shows the utter contempt of RSS/BJP towards backward caste political leaders. Primitive RSS/BJP with their upper caste complex needs to be taught a tough lesson</comment>

<comment>blah blah. Sunni muslim at it's best...spreading hatred.</comment>

<comment>Primitive RSS/BJP people  are trying to make the whole of India into a vast Jungle where cultureless, semi-literate/illiterate "lions"can freely roam, but to fool the innocent people of Bihar they are talking about Jungle raj in Bihar. This Jungle raj phrase itself is the outcome of the upper caste complex of RSS/BJP. The upper caste intellectuals in RSS/BJP truly believe that dalits/backwards cannot rule because they are not Kshatriyas, they will only tolerate a dalit/backward who recognise the kshatriya authority of RSS. Since Nitish & Lalu have no reverence for the Kshatriya unlike a dalit/backward in RSS/BJP, they cannot tolerate them</comment>

<comment>You don't know how some people in their AC rooms are dying to see the Jungle Raj in Bihar so a relieved Lalu can provide them the usual Joker services...</comment>

<comment>The most desirable outcome in Bihar would be Nitish winning every single seat that was contested, and laloo getting squat(popular vote as well as seats), the Congress rallying as a centrist, liberal party, and not a Frankenstein of the license Raj.That won't happen, this is India, not Singapore.What we need is to make sure that capitalist states are free from theocratic and Socialist hellholes.Push for federalism, not development.</comment>

<comment>As long as primitive RSS/BJP is a force in any society, that society will not develop. A society that is open to new ideas can only develop. Primitive RSS/BJP is the main obstacle to development in India. Biharis have an important job, finish off/expel RSS/BJP from the land of Bihar</comment>

<comment>Develop in Christian standards...? Genuinely curious.</comment>

<comment>RSS/BJP is masters in destruction and "sishus" in construction.saying development a 1000 times will not bring any development unless you change.</comment>

<comment>Why don't you answer my question instead of going on like a broken record...</comment>

<comment>What answer? here the topic is different. If you want to talk about the development orientation of Christianity & Hinduism, let there be a specific thread for that. Now Bihar is the topic</comment>

<comment>But you don't seem to have any knowledge about Bihari scenario. So anything is good here. Besides, Bihar is just an excuse for your irrelevant tirade here.</comment>

<comment>India needs a single party rule for at least 5 years for development- too many cooks spoil the broth - for now Bihar should vote for development .We need strong and progressive Bharat.</comment>

<comment>no single party is contesting. you are late in waking up.</comment>

<comment>It will be a reality soon when we have Khangress Mukt Bharath, Question of a few months.</comment>

<comment>RSS/BJP people cannot perform any development, they are masters only in destruction. If Biharis wants development, first thing they must do is to expel RSS/BJP from Bihar</comment>

<comment>No for that complete RJD and the rowdy section of JDU needs to be eradicated. You didn't know that, right? Of course. You are not involved after all.</comment>

<comment>Sangeet Som, Sakshi Maharaj, Sanjay Baliyan left no stone unturned to incite the villagers. You can check their ''ideas' before the incident took place to get some clues how they were utilizing the innocent villagers to do a criminal and heinous act. Unfortunately, they turned themselves as the real anti-nationals.</comment>

<comment>Hey Gabbar, do you know the deeds of Lalu kins and partymen? Why don't you read it....</comment>

<comment>Lalu, his keens and partymen have paid their price with their defeat by Bihar peoples. BJP went into oblivion under Ataljee for their wrong policies and people's anger supported by irritating 'India Shining' campaign. Modi has bluffed peoples of India in general and Bihar in particular by not implementing any of his promises of development. No black money arrived till now, no employment generated for the youth. Adding salt in the wound, vitiating communal atmosphere has halt the process of development and diverted the attention from real to unreal issues.</comment>

<comment>For Bihar, the immediate issue is the Jungle Raj however much you want to console yourself they "paid their price". No one was waiting for black money here, for all know the worth of hard work and are not quite interested in free lunches. Even communal atmosphere doesn't work.... man, what are you talking about? Don't preach.</comment>

<comment>''Man what are you talking about?'' I am talking about the present situation where the Jungleraj term assigned by your party is just to defame the govt. of Nitish who is in the right path of development. People have again and again shown their trust for him as evidenced by different opinion polls. And waiting for black money is not to enjoy free lunch or else, it is just the articulation of a promise which was much hyped by Modi to cash votes in the LS election. Unfulfilled promises are always hit hard by masses. Communal atmosphere creation is the just opposite of development process,it will create enormous number of Jungle Raj throughout this country.</comment>

<comment>There is no doubt that Mr. Nitish Kumar is a proven good administrator- Bihar owes him one for the unenviable task of cleaning up the filth left behind the unscrupulous and shameless dacoits like  Lalu. However his ego, his unbridled ambition and overconfidence along with the inherent casteist attitude got the better of him. When vices start to outweigh virtues a leader far from being an asset becomes a liability. Then the fact that finally it  is the time where the wind is blowing with our prime-minister Mr. Narendra Modi. A resurgent India needs visionary leaders not frogs from the well no matter how accomplished the frog maybe. In all likelihood the Bihari voters will choose to vote for an all inclusive promising future instead of championing vindictive caste wars. One would like to think that they have waddled in that filth for decades now and in the process sunk themselves and their state to new depths over the decades by now. Tge reward being a Bihar synonymous with a pig stye and being a Bihari butt of jokes. Same Bihar which was the richest Indian state at the time of independence. We hear a lot about Bihari prestige and self respect which is such a miserable joke given that what the rest of the world thinks about Bihar, its leaders and those who vote them to represent themselves. Hopefully Bihar will grab this opportunity. </comment>

<comment>Food inflation is at its minimum at around 3 % currently compared to 14 % during black days of congress...But only one singular issue of 'Pulses/Dal' prices is being highlighted to eclipse the overall achievements of BJP on this front..The prices of Dal have skyrocketed not due to policies of central govt. but they're a result of combined factors as -1> Record low rainfall in last year or so..2> Inability of state govts. to crack down hoarders..3> The gradual stagnation of pulses production through the years , as the population growth has overtaken the supply...</comment>

<comment>My analysis of TV channels:1. CNN IBN - AAP channel. Highlights AK and hides others2. India Today - Anto Modi channel esp. with Rajdeep3. NDTV - anti Hindu channel, possibly because all anchors and the founders are against Hindus4. Times of India and News X - mostly neutral though a bit noisy</comment>

<comment>Please tell what local channels in districts and state tell about Bihar elections. That will be reliable than English Channels unless there is a monopoly of several TV channels by one political party as in Tamil Nadu earlier. Now of the situation is better as most of the political parties have their own  channels in TN.But what is the major subject in this election in Bihar.Is it pertaining to the state subjects or Modi's performance? But something strange is happening in Maharashtra Thane/Kalyan civic polls. That is relationship with Muslimstan West(Pakistan) .But Mumbai has its own reasons for that as a metro it suffered maximum under terrorism. The lesson is if right decisions are not taken in respect of the promises made during the elections by the state/centre and subject matter of the centre trickles down to local elections. .What people are concerned with in Bihar?Any way the chances of minority voting for BJP is very remote.  Are beef issue, dhal price,dadri killing and mangalore killing, dalit lynching in HP going to change the minds of Hindus to be seen.</comment>

<comment>NDTV feels more like anti-India channel. Ashamed of being Indian, always grabbing for an apology. : \</comment>

<comment>It is very sad to see such a personality like NM behaving like a joker in fromt of all this  hungama.Its high time that he show some Administrative skills.There are many who would love to see him like a statesman.</comment>

<comment>We have so many people, why should NaMo look like a joker? Please visit near by psychologist and get good treatment</comment>

<comment>U seem to still have hope with NM, where as I see him preparing for another foreign tour, when so many ugly things are happening around Delhi.His past tours have not got any great thing for India, it is only a PR exercise, where NM is great.While MM did many great things without a speking a single word, take for example reduction in poverty to 12 %</comment>

<comment>Give more example while this claim is being checked for veracity...</comment>

<comment>The present development that u see, is of because of PV and MM.</comment>

<comment>PVNR yes. MM was just a staff.</comment>

<comment>I dont know who influenced whome, but PV and MM made  good combination, were aware of Indian ground realities and never talke out of turn or bosted .</comment>

<comment>LOL... after PVNR was out, you went for a Kumbhakarni Nidra? If NM is able to bypass all the PMs in between, that's one achievement too.Some ugly things happened in PVNR's watch too. You don't appear to mind that.</comment>

<comment>I wonder why Niteesh and Lalu get communal problems each time they faught against BJP! Is it only BJP that shows them communal issues ?? They never have seen any communal violations in last 10 years of ruling ???? Is it really that much pure secular government that they have provided last 10 yrs in Bihar??</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Haha you rely on media news and have audacity to comment too. No your 'likely' is just a false hope!</comment>

<comment>BJP;s ultimate goal is to full fill the RSS agenda of Hindu Rashtra which of course nicely packaged for public conception as development agenda, The next is make excellent promises on which BJP excel. But the people slowly realizing they have been misled with all great promises. When the prices goes up on essential commiidity either they keep quite or find some excuses. Interestingly in social media there is a group of trained people to abuse all those who say anything against BJP and heir mistakes, and whenever you pin point any mistake of BJP then they counter  it with the past mistake of UPA and in many cases with choicest abuse focusing on Gandhis.It is in any case an interesting situation. And no body knows what will be the end result, and where the people and country is placed in the whole daily circus.</comment>

<comment>This is called "Sawoo Sunar Ki ek Luhar ki" ...SuMo tried to blame Nitish for all the thing .. now Nitish kumar has turned the table on him ... Being a smaller partner there was no question of he being projected as PM candidate but reason for breakup was given Nitish want to become PM ... but the fact was Advani and Sushil Modi was pulling all the trigger hiding behind Nitish kuamr back ...     Now Nitsih kumar small but true revelation has turned the heat in BJP camp ... abhi bahut kuch bahar aana baaki hai ...... ye to sirf trailer hai ...</comment>

<comment>Nitish is a certified backstabber. Making a scapegoat of the loyal person he had in the alliance.</comment>

<comment>Nitish is fighting a big battle in Bihar and hopefully, occupy the saddle for another five years term.</comment>

<comment>I care a hoot for Nitish occupying the throne. He is a time server and back stabber who may not even hesitate to shake hands with BJP yet  again  if the situation warrants !!What I want through these elections is total annihilation and a comprehensive rout  of the BJP to put it in its rightful place by not not taking the people literally for granted.  A win for the BJP will intoxicate this party already in a severe bout of hubris and carry on its neo-liberal agenda with even greater vigour and ferocity than earlier !!</comment>

<comment>I care a hoot for what you feel in your own intoxicated hubris. BJP is best bet for Bihar and it is the party to be winner.We know how to handle the drunkards...</comment>

<comment>After voting for narendra modi, the words and action of narendra modi is jumbled into jumla.The voters and supporters of narendra modi feels suffocated.It is no time to go after the muslims.Narendra modi is so far shown very poor in judgement.The vegetables and pulses prices have shoot the sky.The corruption is yet to be rained, prices of everything is flying sky high but the PM which promised skyhigh for black money control has fallen extreme short of the expectations.Narendra modi is presently not running the gujrat government which could be much easier but the indian government which is highly complex and dirty.Rougue elements are making a mockery of the PM administrative capability.</comment>

<comment>Samuel, if you do not see any development after the 10 year misrule of Sonia, then you are either sleeping or acting so.  In the last one year and half, several development initiatives have been taken by the government. For you people, Dadri may be the only yard stick but the majority of Indians trust this government rather than corrupt and anti majority government of the previous regime. As far as elections in Bihar are concerned, the voters have already decided for a change in the government and whatever lies or abuses Nitish and Laly make it will make no impact on the voters. People know Nitish is a backstabber and Lalu is one of the most corrupt, divisive figure in Indian politics. He may have succeeded in 1990s but the people see the developments BJP or NDA governments. People like this writer may have soft corner for Nitish Kumar but Biharis have already decided to throw out Nitish this government as people feel that enough opportunity has been given to him and they will try out NDA this time. Watch out for the results on 8 Nov.</comment>

<comment>Yes, i hope narendra modi is the winner but lot of introspection needs to be done after the bihar elections.Otherwise the italian mafia would rule india.</comment>

<comment>Pm's pr team is helping him get bits of exposure in foreign land and rest of the team comes up with slogans but how to work it out on ground is known to none hence everything is turned into hawabaazi.</comment>

<comment>Except for the die-hard Bhakths and those who are in paid rolls in Feku's PR network, everybody else are feeling greatly suffocated. You are definitely right !!</comment>

<comment>u seem to suffocated since brain is full of Pork shit</comment>

<comment>Distilled idiot and egregious liar -  V Shashidhar - Why you worship P1gs, a name  which you always use in a derogatory manner to abuse some one ? Aren't you the biggest hypocrite ??</comment>

<comment>d*ck head what crap do u spam !!!! why are u scared and use some one else name moron !!!!</comment>

<comment>you complain over suffocation against modi  even before he was not in pm. now there are two jobs that trolls have left1. show themselves as hindu and hiding their Muslim identity under hindu name.2. show themselves as earlier modi voter. but the bitter truth is that once a modi/Hindu hater always a modi or hindu hater, like once a muslim always a muslim.</comment>

<comment>Everyone is entitled for their opinion. I just read the names of the people commented and the suffocation is definitely justified for those individuals and probably some more.</comment>

<comment>So this is one more example of half truths that the author is trying</comment>

<comment>Now I hope Bhakts will hesitate to abuse this piece of Text or the writer for that matter</comment>

<comment>Taken from Kejriwal for PM 2019:While co-operative federalism takes back seat, while 390 drought hit districts wait, a naked dance of crony capitalism goes on and on:1. Nepal: Power gen->Ambani2. Bangladesh: Power Gen->Ambani, Mining->Adani3. Australia: Mining ->Adani4. USA: MOU with Facebook Internetorg India deployment & Defense production outsourcing MOU with Reliance Telecom & Reliance Aerospace (Ambani)5. France: MOU for Rafael manufacturing with Reliance Defense Productions.6. UAE: Order received to supply 100 fighter brigade for UAE Navy- -> Reliance Defense Productions7. Australia: Mining contract signed by Adani Enterprises8. CBMs (Confidence Building Measures) with Pakistan too benefited Adani to sign Rs 5000 Cr worth power gen project in Pakistan with Adani team visited Pakistan in 2014Further Modi tours planned in 2015 to countries: Israel, Turkey, UK, Palestine, Malaysia Singapore, Russia, Pakistan and lets wait and watch the outcome.And now an out of box thought process contradicting what main stream media claim: With the lynching and the killing of Muslims by RSS elements, with the incendiary rhetoric / divisive statements of Haryana CM, BJP Union Ministers, BJP Law Makers, MPs and MLAs; it is quite natural that Muslims have turned away from BJP.Thus BJP has become lame duck deprived from almost one crore and twenty five lakh Muslim Votes from Bihar, almost 20% vote not available to BJP.RSS Chief's reminder to BJP to review the current reservation policy has turned away the OBC, EBC, SC and ST from BJP. This way, BJP is now deprived of the majority of 65% of Bihar population, more than 4 Crores of Bihari votes.With APND Modi making only Jumla, the general mass has turned away from BJP. All the people waited for Rs. 15 Lakhs for one-and-a half year instead they have got daal at Rs. 200 per kg.Biharis, mostly the poor, the deprived, the hand to mouth are furious at Modi for he follows crony capitalism and he has shun the constitutional duty of following the co-operative socialism!Only that particular class of people who dominated Bihar politics, prior to Mandal, majority of the ex-congressmen, and now have joined BJP in the hope of ruling Bihar again will automatically vote for BJP. This is the solid 15% vote bank of BJP - all weather ready, ever ready vote bank.BJP has logically given more than 50% of seats to this class. Interesting to note that the party with a difference, who abuse other political parties of minority apeasement and minority vote bank politics is performing same. Lesson - Is hamaam mein sab nangen hain!Encounter King of Gujarat, Amit Shah is using every Kautaliya Neeti in Bihar election, sam, dam, dand, vibhed. He recognised that dam works best in Bihar. And I learnt that BJP is distributing among the Bihari electorates Rs.10, 000 Crores. But this amount may fetch the BJP close to one Crore votes only. Since BJP needs at least 2.5 Crore votes in Bihar, its appropriately right time that BJP increases the amount to be distributed to Rs. 25, 000 Crore before it is too late!As if stationing half of the union cabinet ministers and most of the BJP MPs in Patna is not considered sufficiently enough for campaign, BJP is ringing danger bells demanding law makers from BJP ruled states to increase the quantum of the campaign but the sore outcome is that the Bihari electorates are refusing to listen to these Baharis, the outsiders.May be additional laws of Chanakya Neeti need to be applied. Last but not least: Wise ex-RSS Pracharak said: “If RSS ‘really’ (emphasis on ‘really’) wants you to win an election, almost no power on earth can stop you from winning an election!”Therefore Encounter King Amit Shah and Ham Panch Hamare Pachees Narendra Modi must drop every thing and run to Nagpur and beg RSS Chief to issue a Fatawa, a Firman to the RSS members to join the prachar lest Bihar 2015 becomes India 2004, 2009 fiasco!</comment>

<comment>Ambani and Adani are party neutral.The allegations against narendra modi borders on lunancy.These corporates are sharp and would benefit from the narendra modi initiatives.Nothing great.Narendra Modi should focus more on the bread and butter issues of the indians like vegetables and pulses prices have shot sky high when our neighbours are buying the same at 1/4th of the prices.Railway fare increased but where are the services, it is same shit.Corruption is raining high while all policies of congress are been accepted.All policies are made subservant to the PMO as they know the best others are fools.</comment>

<comment>Nitish is good, but once he gets to power with help from Lalu, RJD and Lalu group will want a say in the Govt and will extract its pound of flesh and that would cause Bihar people immense pain</comment>

<comment>A man who did not hesitate a minute to do an alliance with a convicted criminal, whom he was fighting for more than 10 years is "good"? LMFAO.</comment>

<comment>BJP also aligned with Shiv sena a party of goondas.Cong besides being corrupt aligned with NCP ,most corrupt party and now BJP is cosying up to them There are no saints  in politics and all parties are just practical.The choice is only who or which is the lesser evil.You can LMFAO or choose a unique method of expression but politics is played this way ,less by few parties and more by few others. Period</comment>

<comment>N-othing in A-ction, only Mo-uth speaking was said to be the achievement of NaMo.Fondly called as PhotoShop Prime Ministerof India, Narendra Modi has spent atleast 70% of days as PM in countries other than India. About Rs 500 crores of tax payers money is said to have been spent on these tours.Though, it was promised by him that, he will create employment across India, other than making facilites at his home state Gujrat and expanding diamond business opportunities for his Gujjus, he has done nothing. Now, he is expecting Bihari voters to cast vote for his no achievement.</comment>

<comment>Your maths is poor. So, are you still in the same class... or got the benefit of "no fail" policy? That won't help in Xth board. Please study seriously.</comment>

<comment>Forget about my math, but remember about your Chemistry which you want to create in this country by pouring violent acidic elements in it. Hope so, a Ramanujam like yours will understand the value of wasted Rs.500 Crores of money at the expense of taxpayer.</comment>

<comment>70% that counts for more than 300 days....r u serious????....u can hyperbole some thing...but that is beyond imagination... But all can be posibble if u r an khujli supporter....like leader like followers....lol</comment>

<comment>Why it is beyond your imagination to think at least 70% of days of him has been spent in foreign countries? How much ''percent'' you have in your imagination as you seem to be a follower of philosopher turned politician so there is no chance of mistake from you. It's the hyperbole PR exercises which are paying dearly to your leaders in Bihar.</comment>

<comment>Not only Khujli but they're part of IIM cabal (Islamify India Mission )..</comment>

<comment>bigots have been taught that the antonym of Modi is Muslim:-)</comment>

<comment>LOL you fancy yourself to be the antonym of Modi?</comment>

<comment>That is what you are taught in your Sakhas English classes if they have any. Learn it by heart 100 times daily and you will surely be awarded one day for this.</comment>

<comment>Possibly..:)</comment>

<comment>I still remember the Delhi elections...BJP said at that time that Delhi would be a cake walk. We all know what happened...this time too fingers crossed. Anything can happen. Especially as Modi has declined to campaign any longer, ..some say its a planned face saving measure of an impending defeat. Anyways I think, most probably.. it will be an alliance with Lalu.... , no matter who wins. All hail the Bihar voter.</comment>

<comment>LMFAO. There are polls that predict absolute victory for BJP too.</comment>

Ofcourse it is posted by our distilled idiot and egregious liar, the exponent of Butler English, our own V Shashidhar.

<comment>Retard , stop spamming forum with shitty messages !!!! no will up vote for shitty spammers like you</comment>

<comment>Distilled idiot and egregious liar  - You have atleast shown some spine  to respond to my post.  Leaving aside your gabbling,  I implore upon you to show your above one line post to an English teacher and just ascertain from him or her, the grammatical errors you have made in just one sentence. You are just a piece of crappy &  filthy d0nkey  sh1t with little substance. Do not delude yourself that with the upvotes you are getting here, you have posted something creative or positive. It is really shame upon you where even a 5th standard Student will write better english !!Every one is aware that this forum is populated with d1ck l1ckers like you who impersonate with multiple IDs and thereby create  a mirage of overwhelming support and so no guesses as to why dumb heads like you get upvotes !!</comment>

<comment>Hoo hoo hoo.... burnol demand spotted.  Is there a question of upvotes?</comment>

<comment>Shahsidhar are you in payroll of modi pr team.I hope that you are more respectful towards a fellow boarder.Your one sentences are more like political slogans.Don't turn people who have expectations from narendra modi against him.Then , you are doing great injustice to the job given to you.</comment>

<comment>if i am payroll i would spamming all day like you and other morons here i only post messages when i am free why bother whether message is 1 line or 10 lines as long it conveys what i want to say</comment>

<comment>I think BJP would win in  Bihar but by narrow margin around (125-130 seats.. )But all the obstacles in the path of BJP are self-created problems due to lack of effective counter to the falsehoods spread by media and opposition...Here is the situation where in a state election , entire  narrative is build around performance of 1 yr old central govt rather than absolute abysmal failure of 3 decades old RJD+CONG+JDU camp...Media has quite shrewdly spun  the discourse to favour their 'sekoolar' masters but ultimately ppl of Bihar would show them the big middle finger..</comment>
