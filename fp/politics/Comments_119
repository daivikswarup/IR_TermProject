<comment>Dadri Muslim and Rohit Vemula BC were more important than state Vice president of a communal party, right?</comment>

<comment>dckheads a.k.a Prstitutes' next FP article would be why Bihar is not Jungle Raj-2???</comment>

<comment>Nitish aur lalu ko pichwade pe laati padegi naa thab pura sach bahar aayegaaa...</comment>

<comment>Irrespective of his past....This is REAL INTOLERANCE and systematic eradication of opposition ala jungle raj style...BTW ,So that bast@rd Kejriwal has also jumped into support AFZAL GURU GANG..... Pls open your eyes pAAPtards... !</comment>

<comment>Bhakats r blond ask them to open their eyes instead !</comment>

<comment>Kujli,Ahustosh,Asish Ketan killed Gajendra Singh.Can we kill these ba$tards in return or let law/people judge them?</comment>

<comment>R u  making urdelf like ur jallad mass murderer ?</comment>

<comment>First  you lot , should  rip off that Yasmac out of your face...and then see the real world....or its quite possible you're an Islamic fanatic by DNA ( Born in that breed or  nurtured to be  a commie )  hence the intentional ignorance of the reality...</comment>

<comment>R u bhakat?</comment>

<comment>Yet FP thinks this is minor issue!! Jungle Raj back with Nitish and Lallu hosting the parties after killing their political opponents in the state!!! Great DNA folks!</comment>

<comment>Bihari Goon Killed by Rival Goon for Criminal issues...This must be the headline......</comment>

<comment>This guy had close to 10 cases under sec 307. Thats the way politics in Bihar functions. Anyways his killers should be apprehended asap.</comment>

<comment>Wish they would do the same to khujri then </comment>

<comment>Keep wishing. </comment>

<comment>Jungle Raj back..</comment>

<comment>BJP kills India....... Jungle Raj.......... Yes, India's economy is being killed.....The overall growth in consumer goods was 2.8 per cent. Capital goods production, a proxy for investments, fell a sharp 19.7 per cent in December. "A sustained growth in consumer durables for the seventh consecutive month which came in at 16.5 per cent in December 2015 though is a silver lining, a double-digit decline in the capital sector growth for the second consecutive month is a dampener," Sinha said."Clearly, so long as greenfield investment does not pick up, sustaining capital goods growth will be difficult."</comment>

<comment>lolGone cuckoo since 2014...hahahaha</comment>

<comment>Tum paida hee pagal hue the ya may 2014 so Ho gaye</comment>

<comment>Where is Kujlis tweet condemning the death... In a state where he supported the ruling alliance? </comment>

<comment>Where is runt fekuu's tweet criticising the incident?</comment>

<comment>Modi doesn't uses Twitter like how this rabid Cageriwal does...</comment>

<comment>Ofcourse he uses it for bluffing !</comment>

<comment>There seems to be a confusion between Kujli and Modi's account because the issue of bluffing is involved.... No one can beat Kujli in it as it's his personal domain.</comment>

<comment>Bjp has hired so many criminals leaders into their party. Now they are killed by rival gang. </comment>

<comment>Didn't they break their alliance with JDU, where is the question of criminals?So you acknowledge Grand alliance killed him? </comment>

<comment>nitish lalu gave bjp opportunity to milk this deadly murder- now it's up to bjp how they use it- with in 3 months bjp never thought after big loss nitish will give them such a big opportunity in a platter-</comment>

<comment>But unfortunately this murder wouldn't be covered by the media even a small fraction they allocated to Rohit Vemula issue... If you are a BJP person your death is unwanted but if a Pseudo secular dies,the nation stops....</comment>

<comment>If they cover it, his criminal past will come out. Thats why Modi Ji is also khamosh</comment>

<comment>Then it's Good news for our Adarsh media... Lutyns gang.. His criminal past is the right fodder for them..Why are they silent then, that's my grudge... So I assume it had to be the opposite.</comment>

<comment>Bihar politics is a cesspool. maybe thats why they are all silent</comment>

<comment>Is JNU and UOH clear and pristine water....</comment>

<comment>since its a BJP leader killed by sickular bstrds..its tolerance of the very highest order...ssshhh...pin drop silence</comment>

<comment>Guess now left and Lallus have partnered with their friends from IS/ISI whatever you may call!!Perhaps the idea is to put the fear of physical harm in BJP, what a way to run the government. Where are the intellectuals now!!</comment>

<comment>And comes back lallu's favorite type of rule. The Jungle raj.</comment>

<comment>U r the original shazia?üòú</comment>

<comment>Har@@mi , kam33ney bihari to aapni Bahaar Le aaye par bechare opposition wale (bjp -2 today) and ljp (1 last friday) bemaut mare ja rahe hain</comment>

<comment>Absolutely despicable. Strongly condemn.Is this the "accountable governance" of Mr Prashant Kishor ?Politics reduced to gang-war.Has this ever happened in a BJP-governed state ? AFAIK, no.</comment>

<comment>I agree to everything except the last line. I think you are forgetting how Asaram bapu's witnesses or Vyaapam witnesses were killed one by one in BJP ruled states.</comment>

<comment>I never said that BJP-ruled states are free of crime or witness intimidation. But here, in Bihar, we're seeing influential opposition leaders (political leadership) being eliminated by the mob (which very likely has political patronage) - in other words, party politics at the top level has been reduced to assassination.Have Congress leaders been targeted by the mob in Rajasthan, MP, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh , Jharkhand ? Indeed, even in Bihar when JDU/BJP were ruling, did they target RJD leaders ? Or Congress leaders ?</comment>

<comment>Those were rashtrawadi murders.</comment>

<comment>Woh kam33na cabinet minister njoy kar raha hai. .koi mare koi jiye use ki faraq penda hai? </comment>

<comment>We might see Article 356 soon, at this rate. BJP/NDA should draw up plans for new elections in few months time.</comment>

<comment>Dare feku to do this !</comment>

<comment>Why would I "dare" anyone to do it ? It is not time for it yet anyway. I said it *might* eventually come to that.Rest assured, when the time arrives, there will be plenty of action taken.</comment>

<comment>lack of intellect or education... Are we better than animals ?</comment>

<comment>bihar mein bahar ho , nitish kumar ho</comment>

<comment>Jungle raj is back. </comment>

<comment>Burn down the peace loving pigs</comment>
