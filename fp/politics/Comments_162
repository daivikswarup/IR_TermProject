<comment>The Scheduled Castes want to hijacj the entire country in the name backwardness and reservations.  In reality, The SCs are responsible for the backwardness of SCs, because a small section of powerful SCs are monopolising the Govt.

<comment>Exercising my right to freedom of expression, I can say that BJP should not care to win elections but declare emergency and eliminate all anti nationals who support terrorists like Afzal Guru under whatever guise it may be, and all Leftists who have open policy of breaking up India.</comment>

<comment>Haughty behavior by the upstart chitpvan brahmins caused conflicts with other communities which manifested itself as late as in 1948 in the form of anti-Brahminism after the killing of M.K. Gandhi by Nathuram Godse, a chitpavan brahmin just as  Bal Gangadhar Tilak , Gopalkrishna Gokale. After the fall of the Maratha Empire in 1818, the chitpavan brahmins lost their political dominance to the British.The British would not subsidize the chitpavan brahmins on the same scale that their caste-fellow, the Peshwas had done in the past. Pay and power was now significantly reduced. Poorer chitpavan brahmin students adapted and started learning English because of better opportunities in the British administration. Some of the strongest resistance to change also came from the very same community. Jealously guarding their brahmin stature, the orthodox among the chitpavan brahmins were not eager to see the shastras challenged, nor the conduct of the brahmins becoming indistinguishable from that of the sudras. The vanguard and the old guard clashed many times. The chitpavan brahmin community includes two major politicians in the Gandhian tradition: Gopal Krishna Gokhale whom he acknowledged as a preceptor, & Vinoba Bhave, one of his outstanding disciples. Gandhi describes Bhave as the Jewel of his disciples, and recognized Gokhale as his political guru.However,strong opposition to Gandhi also came from within the chitpavan brahmin  community.V D Savarkar,the founder of the Hindu nationalist political ideology hindutva  is castiest and communal, militant, violent, intolerant,  stealth political cult greed of power hating all the non-chitpavan brahimins which anger that is madness requiring treatment in mental asylums, was a chitpavan brahmin. Several members of the chitpavan community were among the first to embrace d hindutvaideology, which they thought was a logical extension of the legacy of the Peshwas and caste-fellow Tilak. These chitpavans felt out of place with the Jambudvipan social reform movement of Mahatama Phule and the mass politics of Mr.M.K. Gandhi. Large numbers of the community looked to Savarkar, the Hindu Mahasabha and finally the RSS. Gandhi's assassins Narayan Apte and Nathuram Godse, drew their inspiration from fringe groups in this reactionary trend.Therefore, the RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat is saying 'the cultural identity of all Indians is Hindutva' covering the above facts. On kobras (the konkanastha chitpavan brahmin Community) of West of the Country. The chitpavan or chitpawan, are brahmins native to the Konkan with a sizeable Christian Protestant who after the British left grabbed all churches, hospitals, schools, colleges to become their owners and started their practice of untouchability against all the non-chitpawan brahmins. Until the 18th century,the chitpavan brahmins were not esteemed in social ranking and were indeed considered by other brahmin tribes as being an inferior caste of brahmins.It remains concentrated in Maharashtra but also has populations all over the Country and rest of the world, (USA & UK.) According to Bene Israeli legend, the Chitpavan and Bene Israel are descendants from a group of 14 people shipwrecked off the Konkan coast. several immigrant groups including the Parsis, the Bene Israelis,the kudaldeshkar gaud brahmins, and the Konkani saraswat brahmins, and the chitpavan brahmins were the last of these immigrant arrivals.The satavahanas were  sanskritisers. It is possibly at their time that the new group of chitpavan brahmins were formed.Also, a reference to the  chitpavan surname ghaisas, written in Prakrut Marathi can be seen on a tamra-pat (bronze plaque) of the Year 1060 A.D.belonging to the King Mamruni of Shilahara Kingdom, found at Diveagar in Konkan. With the accession of balaji bhat and his family to the supreme authority of the Maratha Confederacy, chitpavan immigrants began arriving en masse from the Konkan to Pune where the Peshwa offered all important offices his fellow-castemen. The chitpavan kin were rewarded with tax relief & grants of land. Historians cite nepotism & corruption as causes of the fall of the Maratha Empire in 1818. Richard Maxwell Eaton states that this rise of the chitpavans is a classic example of social rank rising with political fortune. Traditionally, the chitpavan brahmins were a community of astrologers and priests who offer religious services to other communities. The 20th century descriptions of the chitpavans list inordinate frugality, untrustworthiness, conspiratorialism, phlegmatism. Agriculture was the second major occupation in the community, practiced by the those who possess arable land. Later, chitpavans became prominent in various whitecollar jobs and business. Most of the chitpavan brahmins in Maharashtra have adopted Marathi as their language. Till the 1940s, most of the chitpavans in Konkan spoke a dialect called chitpavani Konkani in their homes. Even at that time, reports recorded chitpavani as a fast disappearing language. But in Dakshina Kannada District and Udupi Districts of Karnataka, this language is being spoken in places like Durgaand Maala of Karkala taluk and also in places like Shishila and Mundaje of Belthangady Taluk.There are no inherently nasalized vowels in standard Marathi whereas the chitpavani dialect of Marathi does have nasalized vowels. Earlier, d deshastha brahmins believed that they were the highest of all brahmins, & looked down upon the chitpavans as parvenus (a relative newcomer to a socioeconomic class),barely equal to the noblest of dvijas. Even the Peshwa was denied the rights to use the ghats reserved for Deshasth priests @ Nashik on the Godavari.Dis usurping of power by chitpavans from the deshastha Brahmins resulted in intense rivalry between the two brahmin communities which continued in late Colonial British India times. The 19th century records also mention Gramanyas or village-level debates between the Chitpavans, & two other communities, namely the Daivajnas, and the Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhus. This lasted for about ten years.RSS WANTS MANUSMRITI TO REPLACE DEMOCRATIC-SECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THIS COUNTRYHalf a century ago, Dr.Ambedkar surveyed the existing data on the physical anthropology of the different castes in his book The Untouchables.He found that the received wisdom of a racial basis of caste was not supported by the data,e.g.:The table for Bengal shows that the chandal who stands sixth in the scheme of social precedence and whose touch pollutes, is not much differentiated from the brahmin. In Bombay the deshastha brahmin bears a closer affinity to the Son-Koli, a fisherman caste, than to his own compeer, the chitpavan brahmin.  The Mahar, the Untouchable of the Maratha region, comes next together with the Kunbi, the peasant.  They follow in order the shenvi brahmin, the nagar brahmin and the high-caste Maratha. These results  mean that there is no correspondence between social gradation and physical differentiation in Bombay. A remarkable case of differentiation in skull and nose indexes, noted by Dr. Ambedkar, was found to exist between the brahmin and the (untouchable) Chamar of Uttar Pradesh. But this does not prove that brahmins are foreigners, because the data for the U.P. brahmin were found to be very close to those for the Khattri and the untouchable Chuhra of Punjab. If the U.P. brahmin is indeed foreign to U.P., he is by no means foreign to India, at least not more than the Punjab untouchables. This confirms the scenario which we can derive from the Vedic and ItihAsa-PurANa literature:the Vedic tradition was brought east from d Vedic heartland by brahmins who were physically indistinguishable from the lower castes there, when the heartland in Punjab-Haryana at its apogee exported its culture to the whole Aryavarta (comparable to the planned importation of brahmins into Bengal and the South around the turn of the Christian era).  These were just two of the numerous intra-Indian migrations of caste groups.Recent research has not refuted Ambedkar,s views. A press report on a recent anthropological survey led by Kumar Suresh Singh explains:English anthropologists contended that the upper castes of India belonged to the Caucasian race and the rest drew their origin from Australoid types.The survey has revealed this to be a myth.Biologically &linguistically, we are very mixed, says Suresh Singh () The report says that the people of India have more genes in common, and also share a large number of morphological traits.There is much greater homogenization in terms of morphological and genetic traits at the regional level, says the report. For example, the brahmins of Tamil Nadu (esp.Iyengars) share more traits with non-brahmins in d state than with fellow brahmins in western or northern India.The sons-of-the-soil theory also stands demolished. The Anthropological Survey of India has found no community in India that cant remember having migrated from some other part of the country.Internal migration accounts for much of India's complex ethnic landscape, while there is no evidence of a separate or foreign origin for the upper castes.Among other scientists who reject the identification of caste (varNa) with race on physical-anthropological grounds, we may cite Kailash C. Malhotra:Detailed anthropometric surveys carried out among the people of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Bengal and Tamil Nadu revealed significant regional differences within a caste and a closer resemblance between castes of different varnas within a region than between sub-populations of the caste from different regions. On the basis of analysis of stature, cephalic and nasal index, H.K. Rakshit (1966) concludes that the Brahmins of India are heterogeneous & suggest incorporation of more than one physical type involving more than one migration of people.A more detailed study among 8 Brahmin castes in Maharashtra on whom 18 metric,16 scopic and 8 genetic markers were studied, revealed not only a great heterogeneity in both morphological and genetic characteristics but also showed that 3 Brahmin castes were closer to non-Brahmin castes than [to the] other Brahmin castes.P.P. Majumdar and K.C. Malhotra (1974) observed a great deal of heterogeneity with respect to OAB blood group system among 50 Brahmin samples spread over 11 Indian states. The evidence thus suggests that varna is a sociological and not a homogeneous biological entity.Now it is clear that it is the 1% chitpawan brahmin Rowdy Swayam Sevaks and all its avathars including Bahuth Jiyadha Paapies, Venomous Visha Hindutva Paapis, All Brahmin Venomous Visha Paapis etc, with full of hatred, anger, jealousy, delusion which are defilement of the psychopath mentally retarded minds of stealth hindutva cult requiring mental treatment in mental asylums that gobbled the Master Key of the country through fraud EVMs uses the same law against the JNU who go beyond the theoretical dogmas that bind us to the political, religious and social oppression in the name of democracy. A university like the JNU is the oxygen of democracy, especially when democracy metamorphoses into fascism as is happening today in Prabuddha Bharath are the real traiters and anti-national elements who have to be treated appropriately for their madness. With out maintaining Status quoe as per the Constitution they demolished Places of worship. The are building temples and statues for dreaded murderer nathuram godse which is contempt of the court after misusing the technology to gooble the Master key by tampering the EVMs for Murderer of democratic institutions (Modi). The must be arrested under non bailable provisions of the law to save democracy, liberty, equality and fraternity as enshrined in our Constitution and prevent manusmrity being implemented.</comment>

<comment>Very interesting. </comment>

<comment>This author is not giving news impartially. His words like "adopted a new strategy of communalisation and saffronisation of public spaces by evoking its unique caste identity" this says about this author wish.I really hate when you say nothing is done in the name of development. Just to make you clear lots of company will come to India under make in India program which will create lot of job for youth and everything takes time. Some bill are also required to be passed in parliament so that investor doesn't get surprises.And last but not the least Rss member died in Kerala while vemula as well. Why vemula is highlighted so much in media while  that incident isn't? Why some scholar and media is playing by Congress games which gets raised just before election and than volume glad down after the election is over and what has mayawati did in name of development, even mulayam Singh yadav is better than her.</comment>

<comment>What is more important than his being Anti national is Kanhiyah is not an Individual [rather he is ANTI INDIVIDUAL] - he is a CPI worker, who was powerful enough to Impose emergency along with Indira Gandhi. He will protest Afzal Guru execuation but he will not say a word on murder of merit an Indiviudual right. Rather he wants people themselves to murder Individual rights so that he can impose his single party collective dictatorship=================================================================================Rohit Vemula was also a goon who assaulted ABVP person. They are from the ruling gang [as subset of population]. They are pro-reservation. Perhaps Rohit vemula recognized the emptiness of his life and committed suicide.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------When a person scores above 94% and another gets same seat for 49% in an EXAMINATION when the examiners dont know the examinees then merit does not exist because it has been murdered. A person who was murdered did exist. So also merit.That is the argument of relative morality of Mixed economy, a fascist economy - because measure and morals is a product of ones upbringing they dont exist. What is only moral is what the Constitution and mafia politicians laws state.Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim’s gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of money taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials and mafia politicians.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, but that it cannot be used honestly.Why does not the state allot a seat strictly on merit and snatch it away OPENLY?</comment>

<comment>Hats off to First post ....instead of stopping caste discrimination these media houses are busy in spreading casteism....when will we grow and tell everyone that we r not dalits,SC,St,obc,Hindus ,Muslims,etc. But we r Indians.....

<comment>BJP can afford to wait as socialism[legal robbery] and reservation policy[murder of merit], both INDIVIDUAL rights will push rupee to Rs.10000 = 1 pound. In 1947 100rs = 1 pound and in 1947 4 rs = 1 pound. That is what Socialists want to have single party dictatorship over fragments of India. But compromising and trying fearfully to enter into POISONOUS consensus space is disastrous. BJP should move out of Vajpayee's Gandhian Socialism [MK gandhi sold his supporters Hindus to buy Jinnah and muslims support, Socialism is legal robbery] to focus its will.=================Now BJP/RSS should bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=============================================----------------------------------------------------------------------------------What if some Indians want to screww mother and Indians want to screww motherland?? Is this the reason why Indian men have difficulty in have girl friends and India does not want to get involved in wars outside India, and is deeply INWARD looking?Sigmund Freud father of psychoanalysis said "mother worship" when asked to define India. Continuing this analysis::Arnab Goswami goes slightly wrong when he says even left loves India. Love non-mediated by religion turns motherly love to love for female. That is why Left is intent of screwwing India. That love is sexual love for mother, motherland. Jats and Kapus in Andhra Pradesh[who have burnt a train] are demanding reservation. That is again immoral sexual love for motherland.Such effect of predatory sexual love for motherland [nothing wrong with motherly love]has even led to murder of motherland in history as following shows..Dahir was BRAHMIN King in Sindh. By enlisting the support of local tribes (such as the Jats, Meds and Bhuttos) and Buddhist rulers of Nerun, Bajhra, Kaka Kolak and Siwistan as infantry to his predominantly-mounted army, Muhammad bin Qasim defeated Dahir and captured his eastern territories for the Umayyad Caliphate.Dahir then tried to prevent Qasim from crossing the Indus River, moving his forces to its eastern banks. Eventually, however, Qasim crossed and defeated forces at Jitor led by Jaisiah (Dahir's son). Qasim fought Dahir at Raor (near modern Nawabshah) in 712, killing him; Dahir's wife immolated herself (with other women in her household) in accordance with the Hindu tradition of Jauhar.=========================================================Academicians have swallowed a fascist lie spread by media that India is a democracy.What a Joke! What about the assault on Individual right of merit by reservation policy? In which country are cities brought to a halt by bandhs? Media should first say India was a Ocholocracy[mob rule].India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] not a democracy. Free speech can be explosive unless it is a part of movement to uproot the Ocholocracy. In a Ocholocracy INDIVIDUAL rights are murdered by definition with help of state. Examples of murder of INDIVIDUAL right are reservation policy which is murder of merit, an INDIVIDUAL right and socialism(by definition legal robbery) which is murder property right, another INDIVIDUAL right.Why are Indians not trusted with free gun laws as in USA? Answer to this simple question demolishes free speech argument.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why were leftists associated with secessionists? The culture of socialist legal robbery is manifesting itself as secessionism - because the socialists may have realized it is impossible to come to an understanding on who the supreme dictator should be and they want to establish numerous single part dictatorships over fragments of country. Socialism has to lead to single party dictatorships over fragments of country.Adam Smith, the father of economics, says in economics Man Proposes and God Disposes. If every body in a nation become do-gooders -- God disposes -- and we will have hell on earth. if man proposes to be selfish -- God again disposes -- and we will have prosperity and peace.Giving rational explanation of God, the elder do-gooders , MK Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Ambedkar etc forgot that a strong socialist state is required to do good. And it will demand its pound of flesh closest to the heart – rampant corruption. A strong state emerges in an environment of shortages – to distribute scant resources. Any socialist state will NOT destroy the reason for its existence. 24 hour water supply will reduce water required to be released by 30%. No Government Engineer in India will accept this. Scarcity, distress is required for the reason for its existence. If no scarcity exists it will manufacture it. Mysore had water scarcity even though it had KRS dam beside it. It is a question of power. A society can either have equality or freedom but never both. Why? To enforce equality a strong and intrusive state is required. Stateism is against Individualism and kills freedom.Since 1947, the political parties, government need not care as they have attained emancipation from democracy -- principally by the tool of reservation policy, where vote banks are formed. And they will vote according to predictable patterns whatever the rulers do or don't do. In other words India has become a Fascist state[socialism is a necessary component of it --Nazi means National Socialist]by the vehicle of reservation policy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just voting does not make India democracy. Protection of rights of the smallest minority the INDIVIDUAL MAKES A SYSTEM DEMOCRATIC. The problem is, India is an Ocholocracy[mob rule] where Individual rights are murdered[example is murder of merit an Individual right by reservation policy and property rights by socialism. Socialism is legal robbery.A period of good dictatorship may be required to cure Indians of disease of bad democracy, due to the infection of socialism or legal robbery. Otherwise bad democracy can kill in millions like in Cambodia under Pol Pot. Ocholocracy looks like democracy but it is not. Just look at immorality of Indians- Laloo the reason for largest migration of Biharis from Bihar was reelected.-----------------------------------------------------------It is logically wrong to allow communist parties to function in a multi party democracy as they are for single party dictatorship - they openly state it! Ban communist parties===================================================Rohit Vemula was also a goon who assaulted ABVP person. They are from the ruling gang [as subset of population]. They are pro-reservation. Perhaps Rohit vemula recognized the emptiness of his life and committed suicide.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------When a person scores above 94% and another gets same seat for 49% in an EXAMINATION when the examiners dont know the examinees then merit does not exist because it has been murdered. A person who was murdered did exist. So also merit.That is the argument of relative morality of Mixed economy, a fascist economy - because measure and morals is a product of ones upbringing they dont exist.

<comment>Wow Pre$$titues have started their hit jobs already</comment>

<comment>It seems NaMo has entered grahastasharam at the age of 65, again he has beaten MMS who entered it at the age of 75, because our ever bombastic leader isn't giving any sound bites and retired into a world of make belief, in times of crises or when it is due. Lately he has being acting like Drithrashtra wherein he listens but shuts his eyes on the evil deeds of Duryodhan (Bhakts & Sanghis), he is also aware that Duryodhan (Bhakts & Sanghis) will lead his downfall, but refrains from acting against them since they are his lineage. Thus India is seeing a modern age Mahabharat live in real life. Krishna where are you, it is time you re-write the script of Mahabharat once again with revised climax.</comment>

<comment>This Government is doubling/trebling fees in IIM/IIT to keep away dalits/OBC/BC and poor from higher education.</comment>

<comment>when u get respite from bootlcking the fake gandis read news reports and check for whom the fees was planned to hike....u r just capable of reading "congi news reports", bluffing and spreading canards..did the sickular bstrds tell u that this has already been implemented??</comment>

<comment>Actually the fees is hiked for those on merit so the reservationists can free load.</comment>

<comment>If Mayawati comes to power Dalits will get a lot of statue manufacturing jobs as she will install about 1000 of her own statues around UP.</comment>

<comment>Photoshop jobs are freely available to bhakts to manufacture doctored videos and photos.</comment>

<comment>Patriots, boycott anti national media like indian express , Hindustan Times, India today channel, NDTV,CNN IBN, ABP news</comment>

<comment>Badri, see the trends in the last by polls. BJP and NDFA registered an impressive performance.In UP. MP, Punjab, Karnatraka and everywhere. In Gaziabad (UP) mayoral poll  also BJP made a spectacular victory and yet, you are saying, BJP is losing ground.</comment>

<comment>Dear Author please note...that in 2017 that Jatav boy will vote for BSP and help it win in UP....there after he will still remain unemployed and then 2019 will come. he will get enough time to compare both and will come bak to vote for Modi.....that is what will happen.....till then rejoice...</comment>

<comment>A person rented his house. The tenant used to feed the street dogs daily. But tenant's intentions were not very honest. He started selling things that belonged to the house, such as its doors, windows, etc. Finally when he started selling the bricks of the house, the landlord could not tolerate and went to the court,  won the case and got the tenant out of the house.Now the landlord rented again the house in dilapidated condition to a new tenant who started repairing the house installing windows, doors, etc. The dogs started coming again to the house in the hope that the new tenant just like old one would also feed them.But it did not happen, the new tenant did not feed the dogs and the dogs started barking at the new tenant all the time.House: IndiaLandlord: The Indian publicFirst Tenant: Congress PartySecond Tenant: BJPDogs: Indian Media.</comment>

<comment>Perfect analogy. To put it in perspective, English Media are dogs who are looking for some bones all the time.</comment>

<comment>media in collusion with congress and Leftists are spitting venom against patriots and against the integrity of the nation</comment>

<comment>Where were these patriots when indians were fighting and sacrificing their lives in pursuit of feeedom?</comment>

<comment>hahahahh...good use of story to put your point across....</comment>

<comment>Elections are in 2017 but you have strted campaigning for Congress.Pl stop fooling the readers.</comment>

<comment>How is BJP responsible for the happenings in Hyderabad? Dalits are ungrateful, they prefer to be cheated by congress rather than support Modi who is working hard for everyone.</comment>

<comment>U still dont know?Quite an ignorant guy you</comment>

<comment>This article cm be ignored...nothing new or relevant. ..just the usual anti bjp rant </comment>

<comment>This man is talking like he had everything when Congress and BSP were in power... Unfortunately a completely wrong mindset to differentiate between two governments... If comparison goes then BJP central Government is far far better than that of Congress and BSP in terms of country's development. Ofcourse it's his decision whom to vote and whom not but then people should not be misguided on the basis of caste.. Jai Hind</comment>

<comment>Wat development dude?And the reason he is so dissapointed is not just cause bjp is a poor ruler but it is causeur fekubhai jumlawal promised stars and moon to the people and they all were jumlas afterall he doesnt even realize most of the time wat exactly he is promising and how exactly does he plane to fulfill those promises</comment>

<comment>Just to put you in perspective. I looked at the City of Trivandrum. The following are development initiative from the central government.1. A highway - small stretch of 26 Kms was proposed 28 years back. The work started 3 months back and is in full swing to be completed in 6 months.2.  2 Container transhipment ports are coming up in the vicinity of Trivandrim (Vizhinjam and Colachel). This port also was in proposal stage for the last 20 years.3. Highways connecting Trivandrum to Kanyakumari approved and tenders opened in record 2 months. Work will start in 2 months.This is just for a small city like trivandrum. Think about other large industrialized cities.Please open your eyes and look around for developments.</comment>

<comment>well said...the old adage "Ye jo public hai sab janthi hain" still holds good...even if a trifle few sickular bstrds try their best to blatantly distort it</comment>

<comment>I think , the BSP is going to make an alliance with the Congress this time. That is the only way for Mayawati to remain relevant. BJP is finding hard to have a CM candidate for UP. Without which BJP will not be able to win majority.</comment>

<comment>If Modi is smart, he will kick Smriti Irani out of HRD ministry. Modi's largest constituency are the young, first-time voters. These voters are most affected by the HRD ministry. Smriti is doing irreparable damage to Modi's image. If left to continue, you will soon see the effect in the next few state elections.</comment>

<comment>Your trick of demolishing the house, one brick at a time is not working. BJP is a strong house and Smriti has often proved that she is smart and intelligent.First started with Smriti, then went on to Sushma, then to Arun jaitley. You guys can try as much as you want , But the house is not collapsing.</comment>

<comment>"If Modi is smart"Now that is a billion dollar question.</comment>

<comment>If you want the bring back anti development Congi-Yadhav- Islamo -Hukumath, keep spreading these rumorsVemula was a fake, with a forged certificate.How did he die? was it sucide or murder?Where is Gandhi family now? Having done the damage, they are enjoying themselves.Start with getting your facts right.All know that way forward is not through quotas, but  through development.Development can only come through- Education, infrastructure, road railways, telecommunication, health.Our citizens will do the rest.Only persons with that goal is Mr. Modi and BJP.Either you go with Modi/BJP or bring back  chaos/corruption, as in Bihar, AK 420Choice is quite clear.Responsible journalism will help</comment>

<comment>Would you mind enlightning us regarding the development that has taken place which has made you so proud of the current govt?</comment>

<comment>We will try.Modi has brought in two important pieces of legislation1) GST bill.This will add lakhs of crores to economy of Hindustan.It will eliminate theft of sales tax, black market etc2) Land acquisition bill.This will benefit all farmers by getting them off marginal farming. , and using  the compensation to educate their families and move to new areas of income.Compensation is good. Rs 5 crores per acre.3) With Minister Smriti Irani reforms in education are coming in leaps and bounds4) With Prime Sevak Modi's policy of international relations , Hindustan is gaining respect worldwide.Hopefully that should be enough for you!</comment>

<comment>Hahahah..1) Which GST? GST has been in discussion for more than decades... Let them first enact this, then you can talk about NDA's contribution2) Land Acquisition Bill proposes to do away with Social Impact Assessment for certain categories of projects thus diluting its provisions3) Irani is destroying the autonomy of prestigious institution, herself being 12th pass, she doesn't know $hit about higher education.

<comment>When you get over abusing, make a better suggestion.GST   will Trillion of crores to economy, eliminate black money.Why block it?Land acquisition will free marginal farmers from the poverty trap.Why block it.Under  Smitri Irani, Education is getting a jump start.Why block it?</comment>

<comment>GST will Trillion of crores to economy, eliminate black money...Hehehhe ... Actually GST will simplify tax collection and more financial resources to States. But its been 2 years ...no action on this.Free marginal Farmers from debt trap...are you so naive to think that. It will make private players to get multicrop land easily without social impact assessment and removal of 80% gram sabha approval clause.What has Smriti Irani done for education? putting puppet VC into Central Universities and muzzling the dissenting voices?But hey....you are blinded by choice not compulsion...you wont see Chaddisation of education and other institutions...Good luck...</comment>

<comment>GSTYou  agree, and you should , that it will add trillions to the economy, and help eliminate corruption, Fraud, black money.GST funds are trust funds. The collector the funds hold them in trust for the government.Non  forwarding of the GST collected  funds,in white, is a criminal offenceGST : There has been lots of action.Congis  have blocked its passage.How long do you wish to allow Congis to do that?Rhetoric aside, Make up your mind</comment>

<comment>Let us try and address you concernsThe presumption is that you in good faith.It will not have escaped you, that there are other readers besides you.FARMERS AND LAND ACQUISITONFarmers: Farmers , in Hindustan, and indeed all nations, are marginal.That is a natural phenomena. As Industrialization occurs share of farming decreases.\In Hindustan, average land holding in even in fertile and 'prosperous' , state like Western U.P., Haryana , Punjab, is 5 bighas or less, i.e 1 acre or less.Income per bigha is  at best RS 3,000 per annum ( i.e per year).That translates into  annual income of Rs 15,000 per year or Rs 1,200 per month. Rs 1,200 will not even pay your mobile +internet bill for the month, and the odd visit to the JNU canteen.I will suggest it is not possible to survive , let alone feed a family on Rs 1,200 per month.It is not possible to  to educate the children, it is not possible to provide healthcare, is some one falls sick.Without education it is not possible to acquire the knowledge to enter the knowledge economy world.For citizens - Better income opportunities arise due to knowledge economy.With each succeeding generation the already minuscule, land holding will be  fragmented further.( with the decline in income)Case for land acquisition:Land acquisition rates are based on circle rates; 2 x circle rate  in areas closer to urban,4 x circle rate in inner rural areasThis world out rs 1 crore a bigha, plus minus.The money can be used fr  anew start.Government is helping and willing to help with transition, jobs etc.This is for the landed ones.What exactly do you think the state of the landless is?Need we go further?</comment>

<comment>Just a small information for you regarding the southern most city in India, Far away from Delhi.1. A highway - small stretch of 26 Kms was proposed 28 years back. The work started 3 months back and is in full swing to be completed in 6 months.2.  2 Container transhipment ports are coming up in the vicinity of Trivandrim (Vizhinjam and Colachel). This port also was in proposal stage for the last 20 years.3. Highways connecting Trivandrum to Kanyakumari approved and tenders opened in record 2 months. Work will start in 2 months.This is just for a small city like trivandrum. Think about other large industrialized cities.Please open your eyes and look around for developments.</comment>

<comment>Look around? In Haryana, I only see destruction, burning buses, shops and bikes. That's development I see here...</comment>

<comment>So we are to understand that just the suicide of Rohith has changed the attitude of Dalits towards BJP. Stop lying sir. I am also from UP. There is general feeling of discontent among all sections of UP society towards both the state gov't and the central government. But you are trying to give it a caste angle which is just not true. Most people that I have spoken to, especially in Hathras, Agra and other parts of Western UP feel that all the promises given by BJP have not been fulfilled yet. However, there are some who are patient, and some are not. Even in Western UP, it is still too early to say which way the votes will swing in next year's elections. But, the suicide of Rohith in Hyderabad is an absolute non issue to all, including Dalits.</comment>

<comment>We all know what would happen - BJP is not afraid of the up coming election.</comment>

<comment>This moronic author wrote an entire article based on what Two people felt about BJP... Even the arguments put forward is very shallow...Kindly don't waste our time. </comment>

<comment>If he started telling you about every interview he took then it will become a book dude. Then you will complain he is weiting such big articles. If he hadnt cited these examples then again you wid say to prove the claims or he is blowing smoke from his backside. So u see no matter wat he does people like you will always find something to criticize the author with</comment>

<comment>Let him cite more examples as it will add more weight to his thesis... Instead his featherweight citations  and analogies won't cut ice here. If this author ever would have entered into the world of post graduation and beyond would know his article would be rejected for lack of sources...</comment>

<comment>I am from Western UP, and I have friends from Brahmin, Jat and Dalit communities and I can tell you for sure that the Rohith issue is a non-starter. Because this writer is from First Post which is obliged to file an hourly report on anything against BJP that can be found or invented, they resort to such trash news</comment>

<comment>if ever Vemula has blamed a party then its the SFI...leftist bstrds</comment>

<comment>How can blow job party seek dalits votes when they r lynching them in dadri n other places?</comment>

<comment>Also remember that even for the BSP, they have not really succeeded in stitching up a Dalit - Muslim alliance in the way that SP has. WHY?BSP's achieving a majority on its own in 2007, was mainly because of Brahmin-Thakur-upper caste combined with her own Dalit votes.Muslims even then largely voted for SPLast elections, Mayawati knew that the upper castes won't be voting for her, so she worked overtime to win Muslim votes, but she failed miserably.Dalit and Muslim alliance is not compatible</comment>

<comment>At least not in UP</comment>

<comment>Even though I don't consent to your language, you have hit the nail on the head. The reality of villages in UP, and maybe other parts of India, is that Brahmins, Kshatriyas and the intermediate castes may or may not be friends with Muslims or not. BUT, for the Dalits and the backward castes, they are always at loggerheads with Muslims. WHY? Because Dalits and the Muslims are the poorest in UP, and the first target of Muslim goondagardi are the Dalits. And they are the first Hindus to fight back.Besides they live among Muslims, but eat pork and drink alcohol, so there is always a clash.If any of you don't believe it, visit the villages of UP</comment>

<comment>If BJP wants to win elections they need to realize that most of their 'youth' wing comprises the dominant castes and to be honest is usually too arrogant. These guys tend to get carried away like it happened in Bihar with their motor cycle rallies etc while the common voter feels marginalized. Thinking from the perspective of the nation, it is actually quite desirable that a dalit party like BSP gets to rule the largest state in the country but it needs to get more professionals in its membership.</comment>

<comment>Reading too much media reports gives you a very colored opinion.The chances of BJP winning UP are not good, as I have mentioned beforeBut its no connection to any caste issues.Firstly, let BJP workers accept that people are disillusioned because all the promises that were shown to them have not come true. You speak with 10 people, 9 of them will question you 'acche din kahaan hain'I am from RSS background, and am also BJP worker. Yet, I am telling the truth so that BJP should understand that its not going to be easy for them.Secondly, who are the identifiable leaders? SP and BSP have a very clear advantage in this. If the BJP intends to just superimpose Modi on the local scene, it may have worked in Maharashtra or Haryana, but believe me, it is surely not going to work in UP. Here voters clearly differentiate between Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections.But, I agree that there is a general feeling among karyakartas of the BJP that the party does not take care of them, or pay heed to them, once they win elections. It is not that they are seeking fame, but it is true that many feel ignored and left out.  So, this is arrogance of the leadersBut this has nothing to do with caste</comment>

<comment>Even if they are not, they will be made to look like. If that doesn't work, then create another dalit issue. Game plan is ready boss.</comment>

<comment>U mean to say that all DALITS have turned Anti National.</comment>

<comment>You tried hard to use this card to win out votes for opposition .. it did not work (Read India today poll results) now publishing more stupid analysis</comment>

<comment>sickular bstrds are rattled by by-election results and latest survey by an anti Modi media grp</comment>

<comment>Not only Dalits, every section of the Society has been totally disenchanted and disappointed with the performance of Feku Government which had promised the moon but not complemented it with its  functioning which has been totally insipid, inept and ineffective with implementation seriously lacking on ground. There is a total disconnect between promises through blitzkrieg publicity and delivery !!</comment>

<comment>Only a few disgruntled elements who can not digest the fact that the son of a chaiwala has become the Prime Minister feel disenchanted and disappointed which is understandable. It is these very elements which have been trying to destabilize the country by raking up fake issues. After a small blip, the Modi juggernaut has started rolling again as has been proved by the results of 12 bye polls across India. The NDA registered an impressive victory in 8 of them mostly at the expense of Congress and SP. In Punjab, both A and B teams of Congress ran away scared from the contest. The patriotic people of Punjab are eagerly awaiting the assembly elections so that they can teach a lesson to those who are standing with the anti - national elements in the country.</comment>

<comment>What a misinformed comment.Please show the central sector schemes in UP, funds alloted and how implemented by the state. Like Metros, Rail links, National High ways, other infrastuctre facilities for increasing employment, education, promoting industries etc.Pathetic understanding of central assistance for state improvement.</comment>

<comment>Varnasi woman telling abt Vemula episode is the biggest joke..if prstitutes go and tell her in advance their perverted verdict...this would be the response...Dalit killings in UP are not killings coz its sickular killing</comment>

<comment>You are right. The Ramkali interview gave it away and proved that it is a paid article.</comment>

<comment>"opening schools in Dalit settlements" probably this was not for love to Dalits but to fight the Christian Missionary from converting Dalits to Christian ( ) However that was a good move ( )</comment>

<comment>For a Dalit woman from a village near Varanasi to be aware of the tragic circumstances of Rohith Vemula's suicide shows the remarkable power and reach of the media. </comment>

<comment>Intellectuals demand ban on word “Anti National”, for people who want to Destroy India. They want it replaced with “Differently patriotic”. (The Reviewer, Faking News)</comment>

<comment>Whether UP has popular leader from BJP or Congress? As of now Mayawati and Mulayam only are there!</comment>

<comment>only dalit will not decide who is rull nation all hindus will support bjp in up,we dont need dalit votes</comment>

<comment>Stop your divide and rule technique. You cannot divide Hindus anymore. They are well aware of your designs.</comment>

<comment>Stupendous effort by a paid writer. His many interviews....   what is your sample size? Population spread.   Publish them an readers can draw their own inference. Fp will do great servce by ensuring surveys and inferences are well founded amd not become another rumour mill</comment>

<comment>Haha... we voted our PM based on moditards' cooked up numbers and photoshop-ed pictures.And now, moditards want p-values and power calculations when heresy is against them! Hilarious!!!</comment>

<comment>Stand up for your white priesthoodThey OWN your thoughts and pay for every new convert.</comment>

<comment>Well Firstpost is so unheard of that people think it's an advertisemnt site..</comment>

<comment>Ha ha that was really good. By the way you share my name sir</comment>

<comment>BS. Who knows about this Rohit Vemula outside Hyderabad? Remember Kumar Ketkar. He had said that Dalits will not vote for BJP after Baba Ramdev's supposedly anti Dalit remarks.</comment>

<comment>You forgot Bihar elections too soon, no?</comment>

<comment>Did you see what happened to Bihar now?</comment>

<comment>No. What exactly happened, BJP won back Bihar in new assembly polls?</comment>

<comment>Ok .. sir... great ... go back under the stone you came out of</comment>

<comment>Oh yes, army is out in Bihar due to Jat agitation that led to burning of buildings and killing of 3 people. Oh yes, CBI is investigating Bihar ministers and rulipg party for Vyapam. Oh yes, Bihar CM has given land to her daughter for a penny.</comment>

<comment>So much violence and corruption in Bihar? We must believe that the Jungleraj is back there thanks to Nikhattu Kumar and Lalu ganwar.</comment>

<comment>Sarcasm is lost on bhakts....</comment>

<comment>are you surprised? With Lalu don no.1 what did you expect?</comment>

<comment>I expected and even predicted during Bihar election that if Mahathugbandhan won, the Jungleraj will return with  vengeance.</comment>

<comment>See that? So many people are getting killed in Bihar and nothing is happening? Means govt. is only there to make Lalu rich</comment>

<comment>Baba Ramdev is a yadav ( tell SP to come out against him )</comment>
