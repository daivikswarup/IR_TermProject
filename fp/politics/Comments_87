<comment>a lacklusture govt recycling old policies of earlieer govt.... pre poll promises of black money etc has negated to backgrond....</comment>

<comment>It's the fear what causing serious damage to opposition (claimed) leaders!! It's clear message to the country people that, Congi is not letting to grow the human living standards.</comment>

<comment>I am seeing the trend. There are few bhakts left who know internally they have lost the battle but do not want to admit that Feku govt is hopeless and useless as proved in last 2 years. The vast majority of the voters who genuinely voted for big change with respect to their aspirations and expectations in the 2014 election are already regretting it and even started bashing Feku.</comment>

<comment>Yup. Let your mom drop hers first. The RSS goons are waiting in line. Or if she prefers all at once, it's good too.</comment>

<comment>What a shame. Now the same sham lady who ruled this nation for 10 horrible years is heard calling 'sense of balance....' of others. Ha ha. And there's this media which is publishing such filth.</comment>

<comment>It is win either way for RSS. They always acted against national interests. You call them anti or national both way they love it.</comment>

<comment>Modijee has remarked not without significance that attempts are afoot to destabilize the government--Sonia who has lost all relevance in Indian politcs now in pursuit of her agenda of attack Modi Goverment remarked that Modiji govt lost its balance. Ignore  --those who value the unity of country can  never support the small bunch of KUMAR/ UMAR KAHLID/ APARADHITA  brand agitationists - pretending as high minded cogitationists - who are just extended arms of communist and congress poltical groups..Sonia jee has to bale out RAahul for he supported these anti national in India thinking that it offers a short cut- path to power...Rahul will have to pay for it---Congress desist from pursuing  Negative policy in Parliament-at least now-Modi is committed to Development --support good policies ---Modi ji dont fritter away your or govenmetnal energies on ATTENTION DIVERTING POLITICALS, JNU or Hyderabad University --They will have to be dealt by Law and Order authorities even when Rahul or Soniajee intervene ---Courts will decide THE NOISE THEY MAKE IS JUST SOUND AND FURY SIGNIFYING NOTHING.  THE PRINCIPLE OF NATIONALITY IS INVOLVED. IF THEY ARE ANTI NATONALS THEY WILL BE PUNISHED BY COURTS WHO HANDLE THESE ISSUES NOW. ..CONCENTRATE ON DEVELOPMENT TRY TO GET COOPERATION FROM ALL THOSE INTERESTED IN PEOPLES WELFARE</comment>

<comment>If RSS is so patriotic.then why they dont flag tricolour on their office headqarsters?</comment>

<comment>"balance and Proportion" Sonia, these two words were the ruin of my country. What balance do you want, equal balance to the majority and minority community? the quota system had ruined all the government departments. Incompetent employees are promoted and are on top, unable to make decisions. and what proportions are u talking about, the proportion of wealth which your corrupt ministers and mlas looted in the last ten years of rule... or do u want the improportionately wealthy to dictate terms like in your rule?why dont u give my country a chance to grow, why dont you let the parliament function? yea right ur from another country and all the hypocritic congi sobs ran to u to save the country...there could never be balance and proportion in any country let alone in india</comment>

<comment>As an India you too are the successors  of organization that spied India. You can live as refugees in India</comment>

<comment>The JNU incident has exposed a sinister conspiracy in Indian political discourse. First, a perceived weaker oppostion has been planned as the target by the ruling party. Then they are branded as anti-national, using doctored videos and morphed photographs. Next, this lie is repeated a thousand times by the ruling party and their cronies in the paid new channels. Then, finally the goons of the party are unleashed on the opposition to punish them for the 'anti-national' act, in order to prove its own hyper-nationalism. This is a typical fascist tactics to finish off the opposition. A number of South East Asian ruling parties have done this before. Soniaji should ensure that the bigot RSS could not destroy the democratic discourse of India through this sinister conspiracy.</comment>

<comment>Soniaji ??? really seems you are the parasite of her sh!t</comment>

<comment>Utter load of nonsense..Pappu and mom were attacking RSS saying they don't fly Indian flag...fully knowing the Indian Flag law these monsters created which BJP changed in 2002, after which RSS has been continually flying it..But hey..the pappu & khujili chamchas can keep spreading lies..</comment>

<comment>Then, start saluting the tricolor at every RSS shakha and stop saluting a piece of saffron cloth as the national flag. Else, Indore will be repeated everywhere in India.</comment>

<comment>Sonia ji you should tell your son Mr. Rahul on how to behave with regard to issues like reacting to anti-national sloganeering ...It is your party behaviour that has become a shock to Indians, more after 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Where you are shaming Indian voter by blocking Parliament sessions. What is that makes you feel that you not lost senses since then? We Indians are proud of this government because we need tough actions on people who shouted anti-national slogans and want even tougher actions on Congress MP's who disrupt parliament.</comment>

<comment>Mummy is interested only in making the moron Pappu as PM. Pappu is interested only in getting PM's designation by hook or crook. Sadist AAPpu too wants become PM soon. Their greedy chmachaas are interested only exploiting these three idiots for their own businesses.</comment>

<comment>I saw the India Today sting on the goon lawyers last night. Plain goondaism under the garb of nationalism. Doctored videos and pics, planned attacks, this seems to be a well planned political conspiracy.</comment>

<comment>Sting is too late to beleive to get convinced.</comment>

<comment>did you see the show? what else is there to get convinced when it is all caught on video?</comment>

<comment>What fits into your comfort is a legitimate video and those that doesn't are doctored videos!! What a perfect communist!</comment>

<comment>did you see the doctored video and did you see the actual video? did you see the sting video? first, learn the difference between these three and then give lectures.</comment>

<comment>Who are u interviewing. The same lawyers. Response cannot be different as they may be knowing it is a sting operations from IT. Why IT is going only to politicians? We know because journalists are close to them and to show how they are powerful.Have they gone to any police officials and lawyers in Delhi and asked about the great job they have done? Cheap tactics.</comment>

<comment>do you know what a sting operation is? first watch the report and then comment.</comment>

<comment>Yes What Tehelka journalists did u know!!!</comment>

<comment>do you even think before commenting?</comment>

<comment>You have not answered my question,That is the way u think..Don't be touchy man.Please tell whether Tehelka journalists not doing sting operations? Some operations were stinking. The plain truth is news media lost its glory and people started seeing it with an eye of suspicion.When people do not trust the news u want people like us to trust their sting operations and intentions..I did not want to say in so much words but there is no other language u will understand.If u believe journalists are the epitome of virtue wish u good luck.</comment>

<comment>just one question. was any sting operation by Tehelka doctored? Simple answer is no.</comment>

<comment>I clearly stated what I wanted to say.If u have got full faith in present form of Indian  journalism  be it and wish u a good luck.I want to remind u that u are playing with dangerous  game with anti national slogans..We are reminded of the  fall of Socialist Unions because of the left ideology and the different ways of false propoganda.People like us are very plain in our truth.</comment>

<comment>Yes I have seen all the videos and did not close my eyes like you when the real video was playing.  Yes learning is what commies need to do at schools and not protests.</comment>

<comment>Media should have the minimum decency of not attempting to do anything in which they are a part to the subject matter of a dispute.In this case media is having a head on collision with Lawyers.( Pl feel the hype).What it preaches to others is not practiced by media for example in the matter of conflict of ineterest.. Media is exposing its doule standards.</comment>

<comment>We have seen enough footage in the matter. So according to u lawyers do not know their responsiblity and whatever stuff journalists ptovide we have to believe and Ved Vak? This is unacceptable. Present the sting to court but not to viewers to play victim card and invite sympathy. More so u are a party to the dispute.Others to have judge u.</comment>

<comment>wow, congrats, you are the perfect bhakth, the master of double standards. You will brand people anti-national on the basis of a doctored video but when the real video emerges and when another sting is done, you do not believe it. At least sometimes try to be more loyal to the country than to a party and at least once, try to use your own brain.</comment>

<comment>Media is a party to the dispute.It should not indulge in an act which creates conflict of interest.It should wait for the court order instead of playing victim card.It should have the same degree of decency which it preached to politicains and BCCI people to resign from their post to have a fair probe when they are a party to the dispute.Media is expsoing its double standard..</comment>

<comment>Goondaism is every where. Come to any village of bihar, you will have enough thrash not to open your mouth against Goondaism. When you see TV then only realize, that this country has Goondas. Lawyers are much better behaved than goondas like mamta,  lalu, cpi. </comment>

<comment>with supporters like you, no wonder these goons feel like heroes.</comment>

<comment>They are hero and will be hero. If Chtűya like you be there to support Khalid. Then I will support these lawyers and will hail there beating to my core. </comment>

<comment>good for you, you are a true follower of Mr modi and BJP. Congrats.</comment>

<comment>Leave modi and BJP, But I am hater of opportunist, hypocrites like you and beat you to pieces.</comment>

<comment>It is sickening to see Media still covering congress. It is frivolous, considering we have so much to do considering India's rapid progress in last 2 yrs.India and Indians need your cooperation Media.</comment>

<comment>what progress? just read today's business standard front page. Investments in industrial sector were the lowest in 11 years in 2015. Mr Modi continues with his habit of projecting a false image.,</comment>

<comment>Nonsense...FDi in 2015 highest ever in indian history.It was double to what it was in 2014...Yet the morons will keep crying...Guess what, HIndus have woken up and will show Congress and Khujili their place,,,</comment>

<comment>Majority of Hindus already know about this man. They realised their mistake within a year and thats why the Delhi and Bihar verdicts. Not for nothing is he called feku. Read today's Business Standard. This what it says "Denting tall success claims of the Make in India campaign, data released by the government show investment proposals in the industrial sector, in value terms, were at an 11-year low in 2015."business-standard(dot)com/article/economy-policy/investment-proposals-in-reverse-gear-116022300042_1.html</comment>

<comment>U with rainbow man and Indian against intolerance  all are mullahs with cutting b****la Not have courage to put real nameEven modi personally gives u job u vote against him This is ur real reason for backwardness The day u vote for progress and development instead of religion Day of ur dawn Think about it </comment>

<comment>unlike bhakth jokers, i do not vote based on religion. You think people in Delhi and Bihar voted based on religion in assembly elections? Did you even read the report i asked you to? You would have realised what a liar your leader is. Not for nothing is he called feku.</comment>

<comment>u can only shout anti india slogans,.....then how can u see the progress...india is the fastest growing economy in the world,, it has fetched highest amount of fdi leaving back usa, china.......a patroit to his father afzhhul guru n  ammi eeeeshart jehanuuuuu will never know this</comment>

<comment>caring about my country is not equal to shouting slogans against it but then again, what would a pseudo-nationalist like you know about country and caring about it.As for progress, this is what is the actual progress:Denting tall success claims of the Make in India campaign, data released by the government show investment proposals in the industrial sector, in value terms, were at an 11-year low in 2015.business-standard(dot)com/article/economy-policy/investment-proposals-in-reverse-gear-116022300042_1.html</comment>

This govt is damaging the economy built by the working class  and instigating violence purported goondaism in court and  institution an absolute act of anti national have no right to continue</comment>

<comment>If u dont understand, doesn't mean the world is dark. cross the idiotic paranoia.Trust me, Modiji is doing a great job for India's poor, in-spite of vandal politicians trying to derail</comment>

<comment>He is the worse PM who is blind for facts. All fakes and gondaism. business goon party to loot hard working  Indians</comment>

<comment>what has he done? Petrol is costly than aviation fuel and you say he is doing a great job for India's poor? you sure are doing a great job in blind slavery and sycophancy.</comment>

<comment>i think ur father afzzhul ghori  and ammi eshratu jeahnu can only do a great job....and by the way ur grand father Osamu is world famous by his great work.......</comment>

<comment>is petrol costlier than aviation fuel or not? and no i am not your brother so, please do not share the names of your father and fore-fathers with me.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps u think similar to pappu.In Modiji world, all those who work get jobs paying well much more than price increase (which anyway was going up for many many years if u didnt notice)hope u get the point</comment>

<comment>So far Modi did nothing but  high inflation and high taxes.</comment>

<comment>That exposes ur lack of knowledge. thank u.</comment>

<comment>It exposes how blind you have become...</comment>

<comment>Thats fact... Where do you live.. outside India ? Dont  you see how the daily food prices have risen drastically ?</comment>

<comment>Fact = Prices are low.</comment>

<comment>who is this (iidiot) mata sonia whose opinion is foremost???</comment>

<comment>Parliament disruption in UPA govt is called policy paralysis and during Modi time is called opposition to development.... Lolwaaaa Bhakton Lolwaaa</comment>

<comment>what a comparison.. congress was drowned in scams.. the opposition that BJP did was cursory as an opposition party.. advani just warmed the benches and did nothing.. in fact handed power to the conning goverment a second time due to their apathy to raise issues and highlight it to the public... the con government should have been paralysed by it.. rather they went on to easily complete their term and get another one by many indiscriminatory or sickular voters... On the other hand, the same con party is blindly opposing everything, not scams, but even developmental work of the present government..even initiatives begun by it...  wah re wah congi, what a great judgment and comparison .</comment>

<comment>Bargirl turned politician. </comment>

<comment>The congress game plan. Block the parliamentary proceedings. Block any developmental steps. Block the removal of antiquated, inept policies that are their legacy. Keep the country poor. Dole out freebies and handouts to the poor teeming masses naming the programmes after family members. Appease minorities and keep them poor too. Rule this country for another 60 years.</comment>

<comment>turn the pages BJP has damaged India by cheating people of India pelting  stones on  intelligent PM MMS and installing feku drama artist</comment>

<comment>and let them shout anti national slogans ....</comment>

<comment>Now that it is clear, we should actually focus on next step for country's sake.What would be nice steps to expose get the hooligans under control?</comment>

Congress will be reduced to dust next time. Whole nation is aware what you have done to this country!....</comment>

<comment>I have no hopes of Rajya Sabha functioning till the time CONgis are not reduced to 44 even here.</comment>

<comment>Do you when their number will reduce to minority in Rajyasabha.next yr ?we can't wait these losers to bark for long.</comment>

<comment>44 in Rajya Sabha is a good number ( it is almost same as 90 seats of Loksabha ). Current BJP strength is 48 :)</comment>

<comment>Best opportunity for BJP to openly question the congees and Commies on why they are supporting anti nationals </comment>

<comment>who are anti-nationals? who went to Lahore wasting tax payer's money to hug Pakistan PM and take part in birthday and wedding celebrations when that country did not take any action on 26/11 and terrorist attacks continue unabated? was that not anti-national? BJP is not the sole custodian of nationalism.</comment>

<comment>modi  was  chief  hijda  dancer  at  wedding</comment>

<comment>Pappus and AAPpus are anti-nationals.</comment>

<comment>Yes if they allow parliament to function and debate the issues.</comment>

<comment>Bhadvas,hijras,criminals can  not question others nationality,by birth these categories are anti national</comment>

<comment>I see that you are listing commies in different ways.</comment>
