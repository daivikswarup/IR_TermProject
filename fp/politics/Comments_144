<comment>Rupee will continue to collapse as the principal nepotism in India by government[reservation policy] makes the National economy inefficientIn this process, raping economy[non-violent rape of economy!], Rupee has collapsed from Rs. 4 = 1 dollar in 1947 to Rs.74 = 1 dollar in 2013. If the same state of affairs continues rupee will sink to Rs.10000 = 1 dollar. Even farmers are led into the paradise literally - India has become suicide capital of the world. It is fashionable, for some to argue that ANY exchange rate is OK - forgetting that with a country with zero productivity will have an infinitely low value of currency, say with respect to  say Gold. Raping the economy does not pay - but that does not mean I support artificially support a fixed exchange rate. I am questioning CONTINUOUS devaluation in UNOFFICIAL exchange rate.Also devaluation against gold should not be forgotten. In 1947 11.66 grams[tola] of Gold was Rs.103. That represents a 12 % devaluation. However assuming 3% increase in volume of gold production increase every year - there has been 9% devaluation every year. That is due to sin of legal robbery of socialism[as distinct from charity] and murder of merit by reservation policy..</comment>

<comment>India is the land of reservaton.It is high time every community in this country got reservation. Burning a train is a sign of social backwardness. Kapus have proved that they are socially backward and now should be given special reservation.</comment>

<comment>Adam Smith, the father of economics, says in economics Man Proposes and God Disposes. If every body in a nation become do-gooders -- God disposes -- and we will have hell on earth. if man proposes to be selfish -- God again disposes -- and we will have prosperity and peace..Giving rational explanation of God, the elder do-gooders , MK Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Ambedkar etc forgot that a strong socialist state is required to do good. And it will demand its pound of flesh closest to the heart – rampant corruption. A strong state emerges in an environment of shortages – to distribute scant resources. Any socialist state will NOT destroy the reason for its existence. 24 hour water supply will reduce water required to be released by 30%. No Government Engineer in India will accept this. Scarcity, distress is required for the reason for its existence. If no scarcity exists it will manufacture it. Mysore had water scarcity even though it had KRS dam beside it. It is a question of power. A society can either have equality or freedom but never both. Why? To enforce equality a strong and intrusive state is required. Stateism is against Individualism and kills freedom.</comment>

<comment>Congratulations on setting fire to train Kapus! Kapus will show us the way. I will tell what even not even Modi/BJP will tell -  India is already conquered by ISIS/ISI due to reservation policy. Kapus will show us all the joys of circumcision.</comment>

<comment>kapus have section called balijas called as banajigas means one from bana kingdom or vanavarayan kingdom from tamil sangam sources  ...........famous vanthiya thevan of kalki's ponniyin selvan novel was a vanavarayan by the story ..............the vanavarayars, vana thirayan are vandayars of thevar population in cauvery belt............btw balijas are related to bunts of ktka, and krishna thevaraya was a bunt /balija pedigree.........infact of the three dynasty which formed vijayanagar empire only saluva dynaty was of chalukya pedigree........sanga dynasty the founders of vijayanagar empire were themselves called as odeyars were of chola administration pedigree, bunts too are of naga - chola pedigree....saluvas were chalukyas from badami ..........kulothunga chola they claim as chalukya and fought fr chalukyas, but it is a different story all togethereven now just read the history of kodavas they are of chandravamshi from pandyan land , it is clearly documented.......chalukyas were of solanki and other classes  mixed indian and scythian bloods............</comment>

<comment>Apropos the burning of the train... come here to Kenya and observe. Between Nairobi and Mombasa, their 2 biggest cities there a train service.. Built in 1927 it is now steadily falling apart  and the people have no clue. The service is  so bad that nobody uses it. A 450 km Journey takes 12 hrs and is available twice a week..The Chinese are here painstakingly building a new line.. but that will take years.  What does have to do with us??Just think If we had just given away the train that was burnt as a free of cost donation to Kenya.. then their train services would have jumped up 400%. It would transform their country. Mind you this is the state of railways in all African countries - nothing works. In neighbouring Tanzania the train service is so infrequent that in Dar E Salaam you can see trains crossing roads with traffic lights! The bogies are made in India and given to them in the '70s.My point is that our people simply blame their govts for everything, totally ungrateful for what they enjoy already. It has reached such proportions</comment>

<comment>In no other country there are bandhs where whole cities are brought to halt by mobs. It is naked truth that India is Ocholocracy[mob rule] and not democracy. In a democracy Individual rights are protected even if he is ANYBODY. That anybody could be a curd rice eater[brahmin], or Capitalist agent[I heard in my childhood that a foreman was thrown into a blast furnace by proletarian mob], ABVP student[Rohit Vemula is alleged to have acted like that he was part of mob].Consider example of Bangalore in 2014 -Bangalore city and Bruhat (areas surrounding Bangalore which are newly developed) Bangalore has 28 MLA seats. Bangalore and Bruhat Bangalore has approximately one crore population.Karnataka has six crore population.Karnataka legislature assembly has 224 seats.Population per seat in Bangalore = 357,143Population per seat in Karnataka apart from Bangalore=( 6-1) crores/ (224-28) = 255102Disenfranchisement ratio of Urban Voter = 255102/347143 = 0.73. If other urban centres are taken into account in Bangalore, the ratio is expected to fall further. If Ratio is equal to one, there is no disenfranchisement at all.[Disenfranchisement ratio = Per seat population of Karnataka apart from Bangalore divided by Per seat Population of Bangalore]The system has not been able to correct itself, hence it has subverted itself. Why did emancipation take place? Political parties, state has emancipated themselves from democracy by the vehicle of reservation policy.That is because stable VOTE BANKS are formed. India was never a democracy – it was Ocholocracy[mob rule] where by definition individual rights are murdered. Socialism, unlike voluntary charity, introduced into constitution during emergency [with BJP/RSS in jail] is by definition legal robbery.</comment>

<comment>Why the preoccupation with the concerns of the agitators? I would like to find out the following things..1. What is the loss to the Govt ie. the replacement cost of the burnt train? How & when are they going to replace it?2. What about the passengers? How did they proceed on their journey.. How will the agitators apologize or make-up to the hapless passengers who were caught up in this for no fault of their own!. Cannot the Govt legislate that such passengers would be reimbursed their travel costs with a penalty - to be borne by the railways upon presentation of the e-ticket along with proof of ID.?3. Cannot we administer the states/cities through which long distance trains pass so as to accomplish the following..The safety of trains is the responsibility of the state/city through which it is passing. Any agitation by any political party that went out of control has to be controlled by the local state/city. It will also be monetarily responsible for the damage.... That is to say... if the citizens of a particular area go berserk and cause damage to railways etc.. the municipal corporation/taluka of those citizens will compensate for the damages. This will work to everyone's advantage as the govt as well as the people of a given area will have a vested interest not to damage public property.</comment>

<comment>To end caste politics, every caste should get reservation and there should be no open category.</comment>

<comment>Free high quality govt schooling for all can end caste politics in about a generation ie 30 years. </comment>

<comment>In 30 years with reservation policy India will turn into another Sri Lanka. The civil war in Sri Lanka started with reservation policy directed against Tamils. What is required is not education but privatization.</comment>

<comment>Reservation % is only increasing year on year. If it has to go sometime in distant future, then reservation quota should have come down. As long as it's democracy, it's not going to happen in near future, because no party would dare to do this and loose votes. </comment>

<comment>India has stopped being a democracy because reservation policy has created stable vote banks. It is no longer Individual who votes but gangs.Where was BJP irrational and immoral in Bihar elections? Less said of murderers of merit and criminals of opposition the better.1)Appeasement to thugs of pro-reservation, by saying "BJP is for not for scrapping reservation policy" is thoroughly immoral. Casteism is also communalism . Modi committed SUICIDE when he said it and the psychological space was left vacant with contest was between Laloo and Nitish. Why would Yadavs choose Modi when they have their own caste leader in Laloo?Lesson: Election results are entirely unpredictable and depends on whims and fancies of electorate. The master election strategy is - be moral. Even if you lose the elections openly say people are immoral. Dont make "people" into holy cows as socialists will like you to do.2)Begging of votes by Modi by reservation appeasement and begging for investments from foreign nations does not pay. Investors come to get profit and wont drop even a single coin into begging bowl of Modi3)Modi should have defined tolerance as tolerance to inequality - with the bold moral strength of people to say "Let better man win". Believe me people value morality and not just base instincts.</comment>

<comment>agree, but that is the symptom, the cause is the poor job opportunities which forces everyone to go for govt job. For that to go, private sector employment should improve dramatically. For that to happen, mass education needs to become far better. Right now only 5 to 10 percent of our population get good education.In US, 12 crore private sector jobs, 2 crore govt jobs. Here it must be reverse.http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t17.htm</comment>

<comment>Private sector employment is much better today than couple of decades back. Even in India I am sure there are 10 times more private sector jobs than govt but total number of jobs to population ratio would be bad. There are primarily three reason why people crave for govt jobs -1. Job security for life and pension 2. If in right job, you can get rich very fast.3. No accountability. You don't have to worry too much about work.Reservation is a privilege that no one would like to give away even if there are enough jobs in private sector. Kapus are economically better off people and they don't need any special privilege. But as I said it's nice to have for anyone. And they were promised reservation just because they are in good majority in state and can turn around any election.</comment>

<comment>do you have stats ? India is dominated by govt departments and govt owned companies like public sector banks, railways etc.  Private sector is rather small I feel, might be growing fast though.</comment>

<comment>As per official figures the total regular Employment under Central Government as on 31st March, 2011 was 30.87 lakh. Railways was the highest (43.02%) followed by Home Affairs (25.95%), Defence civilian (12.16%), Communications & IT (7.01%) and Finance (3.37%).There may be another 50 Lacs in various PSUs, 13 Lacs in armed forces, and 1-1.5 crores in state govt jobs.So  2-2.5 crores are actively employed by government. The number of govt retired employees may also be very large (2 crore).Private sector may be employing similar number of people. Balance are in unorganised sector (contract/ daily labors), self-employed.</comment>

<comment>thanks, let me also google and try to get some figures.</comment>

<comment>I don't have stats, but majority of people I know in my family and friends of this generation are in private sector. A generation back, few were in govt jobs and rest into farming, business. Also, most of the jobs in private sector are in unorganized industries.</comment>

<comment>no offense, but you and me probably belong to upper class, but there is a vast amount of underclass, which still hankers after govt jobs. The upper class are now shifting from govt jobs to private sector jobs, but how much of private sector jobs is actually driven by domestic demand as distinct from catering to global demand like most of IT sector employment. We lack data on everything. We are not really a data driven society.</comment>

<comment>You are getting confused here.. desire for govt or private job has nothing to do with class. If I am SC but very rich then I wouldn't desire any job. If I am educated from a premiere institute then I may aspire to be in Civil services else private job. So wealth and qualification decides which sector I want to be in. Unless you assume being in upper class automatically makes one rich, what you said doesn't hold. Difference between classes in terms of wealth has blurred a lot.</comment>

<comment>Complete and total murder of merit will end caste politics? Rather it will lead to a situation like in Sri Lanka [Telangana is close to it] where it led to 30 years civil war because of anti-tamil reservation policy. Merit is an INDIVIDUAL right and nothing good can come out of its murder. Another important INDIVIDUAL right is property rights which is murdered by socialism - you have seen the effect of murder in Yugoslavia, USSR, Cambodia etc.Such truths may find difficult to seep in  Naxallite tinged thinking of Telugus.</comment>

<comment>If everyone have caste based reservation then it's merit based system, though within the confines of caste, which is better than current system. Reservations are here to stay forever.</comment>

<comment>In context of reservation, we are not talking about inequality between rich and poor. It was because of centuries of oppression against certain section of people reservation was enforced. To start with it had all the valid reasons, but my point was only against politics around it. It has to go sometime in future but there is no political will.</comment>

<comment>Today every community wants reservation. Politicians want to use it as tool for vote bank politics. Supreme court wants it to continue forever. So the best solution is reservation for all.</comment>

<comment>Dont compromise with the devil. The BEST election strategy is to remain moral. Reservation policy is murder of merit an INDIVIDUAL[smallest minority] right and is deeply immoral.   Human mind is the most fluid of things in this universe. Communist party leaders  arrested and put behind bars til they agree that their single party dictatorship is immoral[no hurry, the can be kept inside for 30 years] will give them time to introspect on murder of millions during Stalin, Pol Pot rule. That will radically alter Indians thinking for the better.Dont worry, with reservation policy on, rupee will keep on collapsing -a system with any  nepotism, even governmental ones,  is inefficient. Markets punish currencies of those nations which are inefficient.</comment>

<comment>Shame shame on Kapus who demand reservation policy[murder of merit].Random discrimination/attacks will always take place - like random shootouts in USA. Does constitution of USA direct madmen to shoot children? That is the price of freedom. What should matter is direction of state policy.However Indian constitution IS racist.The ONLY DISCRIMINATION BY BIRTH WHICH INDIAN CONSTITUTION DOES IS RESERVATION POLICY - THEREFORE IT IS ANTI-UPPER CASTE [MODERN DALITS] RACISM.Racism can be traced from the constitution of a country. For example USA constitution had actual laws sometime in History which was racists.  Social effects can linger for sometime - but it declines rapidly. The "racist" outcome was the rapid decline in British population from 8 lakhs in 1947. One can then argue that the  racism after 1947 was anti-white racism. One can argue that quit India movement was anti-white racist[in the backdrop that Indian Independence fighters were overwhelmingly socialist and socialism is Ocholocracy[mob rule]..======================================================================== Ocholocracy  is mob rule which makes noises like democracy but it is a beast which murders Individual rights like property rights by socialism and merit by reservation policy [Karnataka is the GAGA land of reservation policy]. Racism originates from stateism, where the laws or directive principles push a racist agenda. Constitution of India is guilty of  evils like allowing triple talaq, 4 wives[but not 4 husbands], murder of merit by reservation policy and killing property rights by socialism.Majority consensus, say, to loot Tata [like in Singur, where he was driven out like a madman] or to murder merit by reservation LOOKS like democracy - but it is Ocholocracy[mob rule]. Ocholocracy by definition frequently murders INDIVIDUAL right.Majority rule with INDIVIDUAL right protected by state is democracy.</comment>

<comment>Kapus are cowards and useless...They are not going to get anything from such fragmented protests...Learn from TRS who fought continuously for years to get Telangana...If Kapus want reservation, they must take the fight to every nook and corner of Seemandhra...There must be at least 50 Kapus sitting on dharna / hunger strike at all times outside the house of Chandra Naidu.</comment>

<comment>Dude.. No offence but telangana was formed due to the cunning of congress rather than agitations. It agreed for division on condition that KCR merge his party into congress, blame TDP for telangana in Andhra(Naidu gave his letter of consent for telangana formation), release Jagan from jail and get him elected as CM in AP. Congress in Telangana and YS Jagan in AP and it could control 30-35 mps from AP & TS combined like in previous termsKCR played the game very cleverly. AP voters saw through the game and voted wisely and Congress became the ultimate bakra with only 2 MPS from both TS and AP and congress being wiped off from AP.As the saying goes, even the right thing when done for wrong reasons has negative consequences.</comment>

<comment>Dude, please don't bring up Telangana agitation, we know how it was run.</comment>
