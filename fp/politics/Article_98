New Delhi: Raising the pitch on the Ram temple issue, RSS will now train its volunteers and sympathisers so that they can check the alleged "disinformation campaign" on the social media.BJP leader and former Union Minister Subramanian Swamy, who is actively pursuing the Ram Janambhoomi movement case in court, will provide a perspective on the entire issue to RSS sympathisers at a seminar on 20 February here for handling social media like Twitter and Facebook.The seminar on 'Sri Ram Mandir: Emerging Scenario' will be organised at the Deendayal Research Centre at RSS office in Jhandewala."BJP leader Subramanian Swamy will provide the right perspective and put forth facts over Ram temple construction in Ayodhya to RSS volunteers and sympathisers, who in turn, will help stop the disinformation campaign on the issue on social media," Delhi's RSS media incharge Rajiv Tuli said.Subramanian Swamy.

PTIHe said the issue has to be resolved either through an Act in Parliament or through court and it cannot be resolved by any other means.He alleged that there is a disinformation campaign over the issue on social media and "there is no question of going ahead with temple construction without court consent".RSS has also called for early construction of the Ram Temple at Ayodhya and its chief Mohan Bhagwat had also made a call to this effect sometime ago.The Ram Temple construction issue also came to the fore in the wake of death of VHP chief Ashok Singhal, a key leader of the movement.Tuli said RSS holds such sessions for its volunteers every month and this time it would be on Ram Temple.Similar sessions on intolerance debate and Article 370 have also been held earlier.Swamy recently held a seminar in Delhi university on the issue, which had sparked a major controversy.Â Similar seminars will be held by a VHP affiliate organisation elsewhere in the country.PTI
