<comment>anti hindu pappu gandhi got lot of money in swiss bank to bribe this newspapers.</comment>

<comment>if I stand in   -Washington   in front of Whit House and say I want to bomb the white house and will continue till it is eliminated London and went about giving a lecture to bomb the London streets Paris and cry for the destruction of FranceAll these three countries are members of NATO as well as sitting as a member of the 5 member UN Security Council.in spite having all these powers, would they pat me on the shoulder and buy me a coffee?</comment>

<comment>A straight forward question, will the US allow its Citizen to Organize an event Sympathizing with Osama Bin Laden ??</comment>

<comment>i wish you were aware of the news even just after 9/11 .. but you be happy ignorance is bliss</comment>

<comment>Please read up on all the protests that have happened in the US post the 9/11. You can do this and worse in the US and most European nations.</comment>

<comment>Point out a single protest which talked about break up of US followed by widespread support of these protesters from opposition politicians.</comment>

<comment>Why just one? Let me give you a few. Search for "10 movements to secede from the US".Also, search for how the Vietnam war was stopped, the Korean war was stopped.. Read up about the current 911 truth movement.See the names of the people involved.</comment>

<comment>Read these. Comparing apples and oranges. Some dating back to the years of formation of USA and it's constitution. None since than have actively raised issues with the help of senators or wholesale parties with distortion of facts. As for 911 it is at best as good as man never really landed on moon. Conspiracy theories with abound but I do not see ANY targeted attack against the constitution especially with the elected reprentatived. </comment>

<comment>Do understand that these foreign newspapers are Christian leaning newspapers and they also receive support from evangelical groups and serve their agenda. It is obvious these newspapers are parroting the lines of Congress. Congress and its allies subvert justice and get in the way of investigations by instigating many of the incidences and putting a religious or communal spin on the incident and then seeks to taint BJP. Beware of the anti India forces that are playing Hindus and Muslims against each other while they hollow out the country.</comment>

<comment>This has got to be one of the stupidest comments ever!! NYT is Christian funded?!! You clearly have no clue how the world operates</comment>

<comment>What do you #bhakts have to say about supporting Modi ji and his party, who's MLA collects & counts used condoms & beer bottles in the JNU campus? </comment>

<comment>Come baby come again - in that what's your question?   Please elaborate your question and would then respond to you as precariously hilarious as you said about counting condoms and beers.Come with your question with a bit more clarity.</comment>

<comment>Do you know a news article some time ago that many MNCs in various IT parks the sewage always gets blocked by used condoms??? Did the newspaper reporters clean sewage?  Do news editors verify to see if the reporter is making up stories??? </comment>

<comment>yes, news editors have to verify if reporters are making up stories.</comment>

<comment>All bhakts are organizing a #reuseJNUcondoms campaign to help bhakts who are too poor to buy them lol</comment>

<comment>you and vidya can have a field day outside the windows of your moms for easy picks of condom after every visit of a male.</comment>

<comment>Motherfukkkker, you were born to abuse people, weren't you? I have no idea why b astards like you don't find yourself beaten to death offline. That's because inbred shit eating pigs like you can only abuse people online.Now here's your abuse too - Im happy your mother could save some money by using the 3000 condoms lying in JNU. It is a gift bestowed upon her for the years of service she has offered.MotherF ucker if you respond to me again, I will hunt you down and skin you alive. Don't you f ucking think I won't. Just try me, this is an open challenge you inbred piece of shit.</comment>

<comment>These "leading newspapers" are nothing but leftist rags which nobody of any standing ever reads.  They are mostly read by the people on welfare and unemployment ie the FREELOADERS....   Interestingly, many of these anti-modi articles are written by leftist Indians....LOL</comment>

<comment>I don't know how NY Times qualifies as world's leading newspaper. </comment>

<comment>because its not published in india, as simple as that ;)</comment>

<comment>sangi trolls would claim this as a conspiracy by US, italy, antartica, papa guenea et al  against the govt...sorry forgtot to add pak</comment>

<comment>Yep everyone is out to get Modi the saint !!</comment>

<comment>Congi CHAMCHAS are whining as usual....</comment>

<comment>What about congi trolls </comment>

<comment>Getting defensive comes all the way from the top - Modiji we don't want to hear the same old BS about chai wala and people are jealous etc. your 56 inches seems to have disappeared after you became PM</comment>

<comment>If you do not want to hear Modi then shut your ears....Modi is not there to please you.   We elected him to improve our lives and we are happy with what has happened so far.   Modi is working for his supporters not for you.   Modi will never do anything for Chamchas like you.  So you can whine and cry all you want....Hehehehehe</comment>

<comment>A true reflection of intolerance in most of the comments below - a section of fellow Indians made a bad choice by electing Modi, rather than self reflecting and introspection - most of the chaddis think attacking others is the best self defense - which it isn't. Modi is a failure and PM who couldn't govern even with a majority. Modi wasn't just ready for the job</comment>

<comment>Evangelists and their allies in India are doing best to create obstacles for Modi so that they can go to the polls in 2019 and blame Modi </comment>

<comment>If Modi is a failure what would you call 60 years of congloot rule </comment>

<comment>Modi is a failure for you as he will make life miserable for Chamchas like you....LOL</comment>

<comment>If Modi is a failure what would you call 60 years of congloot rule </comment>

<comment>Martina's comments on Indian politics is equivalent to Alia bhatt talking about Tibetan buddhism..</comment>

<comment>This is unfair.. they did not include Jang, Dawn and tribune (dot pk) or Xinhua... very bad... at least they could have quoted economist, which is known anti-hindu and especially anti-modi  website...</comment>

<comment>Screw New York Times and the french newspaper. They are not aware of the reality in India. They sit from their ac offices and write some nonsense. Modi government is not impinging on any democratic rights. Anti national slogans and questioning the courts after due process of law cannot be allowed under any circumstances.Why can't New York Times write about the Gulf war imposed in Iraq under the pretext of WMD's? Did they ever support the millions of innocent Iraqi people killed in the war? Did NYT protest the blatant bias of the white police officers against the blacks in the USA? These people have nothing better to do than poke their unwanted dirty noses in places where they are not welcome.</comment>

<comment>ha ha NYT became their benchmark... our copy-paste western joota licking presstltutes are looking at other leftist scums for inspiration...</comment>

<comment>frankly nothing is going to stop only the places which had facade till now like jnu are opening up ,it is going to be painful change but yes if india needs to move ahead somewhere we have to stop these centres of anti state politics and nurseries of maoism and even radicalism and move towards development</comment>

<comment>I think these newspapers were unhappy with the progress of India's space program and defense program also...</comment>

<comment>hahaha yes everybody outside india is jealous of the growth of india, whihc comes in the form of weak rs against dollar, no economy reform, tax burdens to get xtra to support falling economy, etc etc</comment>

<comment>Leftists leftists OMG. ! How much they hate India and Hinduism. Everywhere these perverted rascals have invaded the media and humanities academic field. And because of this Europe and America are now threatened by the jehadis. Leftists and jehadis,make a deadly combo and add the Christian evangelicals ,you have a terrible cocktail</comment>

<comment>The fact is publications in USA again are way too liberal and left wing !!! Common people are frustrated even in USA with their media otherwise how will they explain the phenomenal rise of Donald trump ... He is winning all states and us soon going to be republican nominee to president ?!!! Why do people even there agree to statements such as ban Muslims ? Yes no one likes sickular media who will want common people to die in their terrorist activities but still protect mullahs </comment>

<comment>Way too liberal??? OK may be self styled liberals but they should be called leftist fascist. </comment>

<comment>Yes I agree Chandran. People there are also fed up with the media . It is same everywhere - at the end of the day CNN BBC are no moral saints !</comment>

<comment>These are the same people who are voting in thousands to Donald trump ? Remember he has planned total ban on Muslims and American people are living that. He is going to be their republican nominee to president . Why doesn't media focus on him ? Oh yes media is same everywhere. General public actually have opinions so different that media has no clue. Yes people love Donald trump because yes Muslims are dangerous to American society just like they are too Indian </comment>

<comment>Coming from people who these days are busy voting Donald trump and who won three primaries sorry don't need your advice</comment>

<comment>In what way does martina navratilova 's opinions count ? It is of the same consequence as that of shah rukh khan & amir khan.The vested interests always like to blackmail us tossing words like democracy & investments withheld. So called "investments" are no charities. The investing companies stand to make profits & keep sustaining their companies.It was supercilious uk that stood ahead in the queue to sign contracts with Sri.Narendra Modi when he was the CM of Gujarat. Supercilious uk rolled out the red carpet to China.BJP should deport all leftists & jnu carcasses to uk & america asking them to look after them. They need not lament from a distance  sending money to barkha dutts & sagarika ghoses to join them in mass rudaali. When the same jnu carcasses speak in favour of mexicans & muslims in America America would react differently. I am sure these kanhaiya kumars , umar khaleds & arundathi roys would be assets to amertica & uk.</comment>

<comment>People never agree with others' opinion. They merely agree with 'their' opinion expressed by 'others'. If NYT had praised Modi, all Modi haters would have 'disagreed' with it. But they always agree when it supports their viewpoint.Grow up guys. Nobody cares what NYT writes. It is an American newspaper which can write any bullsh*t about other countries and its leaders. US media kept on criticizing Modi and he went on to become the PM of India. Unfortunately, these rubbish articles are the only way for leftist and sickular anti-nationals to get their weekly 0rgasm.</comment>

<comment>Heheheh. USA killed over 1 million civilians in their "War against Terror". I don't entirely disapprove of it.But NYT editors sat with their thumbs up their aszes.. No pious sermons then....</comment>

<comment>Guess you don't read the paper...</comment>

<comment>Basically a news item one shud'nt give too much credence to.... but then its a wake up call for the Bhakts .... as they were the ones who not too long ago were going gaga over the numerous rock shows of fekuchand in madisson sq and elsewhere..... now they have just been shown the other side of the coin..</comment>

<comment>PM Crop Insurance Scheme + One Rank One Pension + Startup India (with Fast Patenting procedure) + Make in India + Railway Modernization + Smart City + PM Jandhan Yojna (Poor people Bank Account) + PM Life Insurance for poor + NRI facilitation (e.g. Madad, Visa etc) endless achievement of the Indian government are pin hole in Opposition political parties in India. What world see is just manufactured Journalism or Intolerance of opposition.</comment>

<comment>Great photo of Modiji on steps of aircraft. Looks like he has lost a lot of weight. The suit fits him perfectly.</comment>

<comment>He is having stress attacks and dirrahea - can't manage nor can run the government despite having the majority </comment>

<comment>Nobody in India takes notice of writings in jaundiced foreign media. Even media in India is cold shouldered by the wise people in the country.</comment>

<comment>Just thinking, if a similar protest was held by say a Hindu group in any of the universities in Muslim countries or Asian countries would we even hear about it? Would politicians over there run in and stoke up the fires? Even in UK or the USA, would politicians run into their universities and mobilize students...? Who will ban politicians from entering our universities? Fact is the Delhi Police entered as per JNU's VC letter and arrested a student leader who incidentally is a Hindu. It's their job and it's now a court case. Simple. It has happened before in Congress 60 year rule in India and 50 year CPI rule in Bengal and will happen again. Extremely unfortunate and shameful that 'Lawyers attack' in Court. It is contempt of Indian Justice System. I also see one of our Muslim brother's in this thread using unacceptable words of abuse against an elected representative of India and calls himself an Indian. You also humiliate those who don't support your view. Anger, revenge or war is never a lasting solution. To him I say, my friend, your behavior mirrors that of those other Juvenile Delinquents. You are creating enemies where non existed before. The real problem India faces is Parliament session will again be disrupted; investors will lose confidence, jobs will disappear for next batch of graduates and so on. The real question is why Mr. Rahul involved in Rohit Virmula case ot JNU? Is it to dodge people's opinion on The Herald case?  If he disrupts Parliament session again this time, he is writing off his own political career. Does his Mother not realize that?</comment>

<comment>The same "leading newspapers" campaigned for more than a decade to finish off Narendra Modi (when he was Gujarat CM)!  How pompous can they be.</comment>

<comment>all those trips abroad are wasted now...</comment>

<comment>waiting for a day when america justifies iraq war</comment>

<comment>Hello world media & dollar received Indian media , what happened to when twin tower was attacked ? The US AND THEIR ALLIES WENT OVER COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY TO ELIMINATE THE ANTI US  AND THEIR TERRORISTS ? Modi has to follow it in INDIA to eliminate the terrorists and anti nationals . He has failed to eliminate the terrorists and the anti nationals . It is not necessary to listen to other's criticism ? Had WESTERN COUNTRIES go to war with AFGHANISTHAN & IRAQ through UN channel ? A BIG NO . The twin tower attackers were from from PAKISTAN & SAUDI ARABIA , but it was not attacked . Afghanisthan & Iraq was attacked . In India terrorist was produced by PAKISTAN. They have to be crushed once for all and see what will happen ?</comment>

<comment>they cant handle muslim in their own country which are of  quantity equivalent to 1/5 of total muslim of uttarpradesh and they treat them as hell , do waterboarding with them for introgation and these guys ask us to treat traitors according to right to speech ,freedom expression</comment>

<comment>An excellent post in the Present scenario...If you criticize me,it's your freedom of speechIf I criticize you,it's my Intolerance.If you judge me,you are EnlightenedIf I judge you,I am Prejudiced.If you question my faith,then you are SecularIf I question your faith,then I am Communal.If you defend yourself,it's because you are a VictimIf I defend myself,it's because I am Ignorant.If you pen your thoughts,it's RevolutionaryIf I pen my thoughts,it's Provocation.If you march,it's a ProtestIf I march,it's a Mob.If you lodge a complaint,you r following the Course of LawIf I lodge a complaint,I am Misusing the Law.Couldn't resist sharing this😇</comment>

<comment>NYT and other world media have praised Modi and India on numerable ocassions since  he became PM but First Post has never informed its readers about praise from international media. WHY ?</comment>

<comment>Because the website's title says "F.India".</comment>

<comment>NYT might be biggest but definitely not independent. This one sided view clearly shows their vested interest.</comment>

<comment>Yep, sck up to the white and maintain the historical tradition.</comment>

<comment>Fellow Indian citizens please beware of anti Indian forces. They are out to destroy our nation and they fear the current Indian rulers. Their fear is that they will loose their grip on India and can not exploit it as done during previous regimes. They are now unable to loot India that is why they are creating trouble through the moles. .That is why there are concerted efforts to make the present nationalist government non functional by creating troubles which are blown out of proportions by the congi-commie-aami traitors and anti national media.</comment>

<comment>F@CK OFF!!! Because of people like you we have this government in power!</comment>

<comment>and due to people like u we were fooled by congress for decades</comment>

<comment>Su8K on a D!ck B!tch!!</comment>

<comment>Blown out of proportion ????Lawyers act like hoodlums and assault the accused, members of their own fraternity inside the Court premises while the Police Commissioner shrugs his hands off and just sits silent naivishly claiming that the going on inside the Court premises are outside the purview of law and order for which his Department has no jurisdiction despite instructions from the SC to the contrary where it wanted the Police to ensure full protection learning from earlier pitfall and you still have the temerity to say that issues are being blown out of proportion !?</comment>

<comment>It is jnu students & teachers who are hoodlums.  What about the conduct of congress & various politicians throwing mikes & assaulting inside Parliament & Sate Assemblies ? It is communists who fired upon many Farmers in West Bengal. It is congress hoodlums who orchestrated the pogrom of Sikhs.Whatever happened to the FREEDOM of Lawyers , Police Commissioners & Hindu aam janata ?Every Hindu should take up arms & KILL such traitors WITHIN. Communists should be outlawed. And fired upon.</comment>

<comment>lawyers act as hooligan everywhere because most of them are product of these fcked up universities having student politics like jnu, where other than studying they do all activities far from real education.in recent they burned all govt vehicle close to court  in u.p,nobody cares but they beat a so called traitor in delhi whole liberal lobby start crying</comment>

<comment>when student union was allowed in all universities hailing from uttarpradesh ,u ask every goon in allahabad or nearby district in up what do u do for living ???answer will be  ,inbhersity se laa k chatra hai  XD</comment>

<comment>ha ha ,good one and true also</comment>

<comment>Go and tell NYT to publish article saying USA will be in Pieces.........and then come and lecture to INDIA.......WHEN INDIA GROWS, FKING SATANS OF WORLD WILL SHOUT.......THAT IS LAW</comment>

<comment>My Advice - change the Charles Bronson pic into something more desi. Then vent your anger against an institution like the NYT.</comment>

<comment>OH, you identified, charles Bronson, but do you remember he is a Vigilante against thugs in New York streets....That is why Charles Bronson the Paul Keresy,</comment>

<comment>Hi  inteligent tolerent eminent gang, for you any one who is anti left,anti Gandhi's and Anti Kejri, anti maoist,anti left extreanist etc is a Bhakt for you gays ..well then let it be in that way, the same why you gang enjoy your Anti India, anti modi and anti BJP status..we are enjoying this desh bhakt status</comment>

<comment>You will need to be anti everything that is rational. That only suits your massive but stupid ego.</comment>

<comment>being rational  give u freedom to shout antiindia slogan in middle of fking capital of the country ,what type of liberal logic is this?????today u shout in jnunext time  u will do it at india gatethen next time u will piss on the WAR MEMORIAL at india gate as bihari muslim did with one @gateway of india ,and nitish was trying to protect them that timebecause u r rational u can bash a national???bravo</comment>

<comment>Dont get so paranoid like a Bollywood heroine shedding tons of fake tears. She will laugh the moment the cameras are pointed the other way. So are you fake nationalists. At first find out who shouted those slogans and what were their credentials? Many possibilities could have taken place. X was giving a lecture when Y (his adversary) wanted to discredit X and so hire z to make the catcalls in the dark and then superimpose the voice with the ones who were making some other slogans! So hod on. We have seen your histrionics at beating your chest crying and waiting for Mother India enough. You needn't worry much about that. If you are a real patriot go to Haryana and quell the mobs. Your deed will be more patriotic than shedding fake tears here in cyber space. I cant be more blunt than this.</comment>

<comment>Nobody wants the raise of India under a nationalist government. International vested interests don't want to see a self sustained India. They want to break our country using their moles and anti national elements among the media and opposition parties.</comment>

<comment>to all sister fuckerr mullahs/AAPTARDS/CONGRESSI , NYT IS THE VERY NEWSPAPER WHICH HAS DISPUTED INDIA'S CLAIM OF KASHMIR AND CALLED INDIA AS AN EXPANSIONIST BULLY STATE AND EVEN SUPPORTED PAKISTAN AND DEFENDED THOSE 26/11 SCUMBAGSS and cOMPARED us TO ISRAEL and even called our nuke programme as threat to region and supported pak in 1971 wa  r</comment>

<comment>khangress:- Pls help RSS to finish commies from India...</comment>

<comment>Nyt : same guys who made fun of us for Mars mission </comment>

<comment>Modiji falls on the feet of hardworking Indian. We all know whose feet mms fell at....#StarkContrast</comment>

<comment>I saw once on social Media about the way Feku bowed before Adani's wife.  It was a 180 degree bend then !?</comment>

<comment>Its still respect to elders moron! </comment>

<comment>Distilled idiot - That was a special 180 degree bend   indulged by Feku to  a billionaire's wife as a mark of respect and courtesy,   which will not be extended to the ordinary !!</comment>

<comment>Distilled hypocrite, modiji just fell on the feet of a normal Indian. Go spread your lies elsewhere...</comment>

<comment>He he !! Now spoken like a true Bhakt and the cat is out of the bag.  Why are you so agitated ??  If I go on an abusive roll, you might not be able to tolerate it.  So better behave properly and remember it is you who started it by calling me Moron !!</comment>

<comment>What cat is out of the bag?  You are just dreaming. And you have never called me a moron before?  Lol. Don't call yourself rationalist anymore. Your anti bjp rant is boring...</comment>

<comment>Being a repulsive prostrator as you really are,  it is only yr prostration and blind devotion which is boring and disgusting where you stoop to defend the indefensible in all situations unmindful as to whether they are justified or not subjectively  !?You are neither fit to give sobriquet to any body or you have the right to sermonize on discarding it being inherently biased and prejudiced  you are with yr partisan comments and in the same vein claiming you are neutral !! Don't become a.laughing stock and be on yr own !!</comment>

<comment>Take your own advice and calm down. I just state facts. If you are repulsed that no one falls on madamji's feet go cry elsewhere. You have facts let's talk. Once again don't call yourself rationalist. Call yourself anti modi...</comment>

<comment>Have you seen that  photo where Feku is seen bowing 180 degrees  to Mrs. Adani ? No person with some semblance of sense will say it is a normal bow with respect.  Moreover, everybody knows the cosy relationship that Feku and Adani enjoy which is not a secret by any means .  So better you also acquaint yourself with some facts before puking yr ignorance here !!As I said before and I reiterate, I  am a  fiercest critic of Feku and the Sangh Parivar, but my criticism always will be based on facts and not imagination !!Moreover just criticising Feku and BJPee  on issues doesn't make any one irrationalist. That said,  how can any one resist the temptation to criticise them when they invite that with their own deplorable conduct !?</comment>

<comment>Did you say adani or advani? I just saw a video of modi bowing to aam aadmi. You continue focusing on adani and madamji bowing. I called you irrational because when it comes to modi you are illogical...</comment>

<comment>request to Congress:- u honobbed with Commies and they swallowed you...now help BJP to clean this country of all commies terrorist....the country will gain much and u will also be able to survive....else the issues of left will help the growth of BJP and death knell for Khangress...as commies have nothing to loose and u have 44 seats to loose..so help RSS to finish off commies...</comment>

<comment>Only in India, people celebrate foreigners defaming us. </comment>

<comment>Anything anti modi including hafeez as shown by jnu...</comment>

<comment>Would recommend people here to read few articles in nyt to understand how anti India and racist to us that newspaper is. </comment>

<comment>Blind supports claim world over increased respect overnight, dimwits bury their head in sand when world over criticizes us for backward policies.</comment>

<comment>So it's means only 31% Hindus r with Modi but not others 69% it's really big gape </comment>

<comment>31% is enough for Modiji. He doesn't need support of anti-nationals</comment>

<comment>Good one.</comment>

<comment>That's true. We can burn the whole country for reservation and be tolerant but disloyalty shown by certain dumb students can't be taken lightly. Proofs can wait, we must first hang them.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>When it comes it sloganeering you know who the mastermind is based on doctored videos and don't know about jat agitation? Who's is naive? No one has shared a video where kanhaiyya is sloganeering(except the doctored videos), but yet the goon lawyers, as per their own admition, apparently beat him up for 2 hours and made him say Bharat Mata ki Jai, wow what an achievement right. Are you interested in facts or just want any random student be made scape goat. Police must investigate and arrest the ones who shouted the slogans. Sorry to disappoint you, I am not an AAP supporter.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I didn't say he was hung. I said he must be hanged, going by the popular reaction because of our biased media and hopeless police, that's what most people want I guess. I am just talking about kanhaiyya here, and going by the videos(the original ones) it was just a dissent, nothing else. You can watch his speech.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>So you still didn't see his speech. It was just against BJP/RSS. The call for Afzal guru program was given by Khaled's union and it was khaled and others who sloganeered and not kanhaiyya. Probably the fake video of kanhaiyya was already out and our smart delhi police arrested him. Now, they can't release him or say he is not the prime accused as it will hurt their big ego.</comment>

<comment>NYT, you forget that Sikhs are being constantly attacked and even killed in the US because they are suspected to be muslim terrorists. Forget about how horribly you profile and treat muslims in your country, even other racial minorities are subject to constant discrimination and abuse.How would your population react if ISIS and Al Qaeda supporting marches are held by Harvard and MIT students and calls are made to destroy America and christianity in America??So give us a break. A country which killed a million civilians under the guise of War on Terror has no right to speak.</comment>

<comment>Hurriyat conference  has called for kashmir band in support of jnu  guys</comment>

<comment>No human being, who wishes to progress, can support the BJP's fight against JNU students.Free speech/thought is what makes us different from the animals and it MUST be protected. If someone had not questioned/changed the norm, we would be the same as other animals today - naked, eating raw food, staying in caves.The more popular example is the earth being round. Everyone believed it to be flat. It looked flat. And, it was blasphemous to call it round. But, someone was brave enough to question it.If everyone decided not to question popular theories/'facts', we would not be where we are today. Hope people have the common sense to see the obvious - without free speech/thought, we are no better than animals.</comment>

<comment>Isn't it expecting too much ???Please read the literature of their ideological fountainhead ... It's my way or high way ...</comment>

<comment>Does some small section of JNU students think they can get away after all they have done to Mother India?India is a democratic country where Majority citizens voice counts. Majority is combination of multiple religions/ Castes/states/communities etc.Every citizen has their own right in this country, that dosnt mean you can voice against your Mother country because the same mother has 1+ billion kids and we will tolerate anything but not hating our Mother.If you hate Mother India you have every right to leave to 80% of countries in the world. If you hate any paarticular Individual or a party fight in a democratic way and there are people to support you. BUt you have no right to hate Mother India. What happened at JNU should be investigated and if hate speech against India is proved then they should be punished very harshly.</comment>

<comment>Oh Yes, authoritarian indeed - what do you suggest, we hang our heads in shame ?- 90 % of our so-called independent media is full of vitriol against the government. Authoritarian, indeed !- Right in the heart of Delhi we have a national shame called JNU where traitors for whom the police is on lookout, are seen delivering inflammatory anti-government speeches across all TV channels. The police are not allowed to enter the 'campus' which is full of traitorous 'students and teachers' - and remember, they are all fully funded by the Indian tax payer ! Authoritarian, indeed !- there is a Chief Minister of a half-state called Delhi who abuses the government 5 times a day, day after day without fail and proclaims that the PM is a psychopath ! And yet, nobody stops his rants - Authoritarian, indeed !- one eminent prest*tute runs a running war of words with a Union Minister and pukes out open letters to the PM. Other prest*tutes fall over each other trying to better her record. Authoritarian, indeed !</comment>

<comment>yes there is a big problem...when did i deny??...and yes we hve to urgently  find ways to solve problems for that!!.....but what i am talking about is the hypocrisy of int. media...the way they degrade us and mock us(both issue are unrelated and different things)...when they themselves are much worse than us...they just havnt got right to give us a "rape capital" of the world tag....they got no right to abuse us and make fun of our country...ek baar abroad jaa naa pata chalega..kese majak ud raha he india ka.I CHALLENGE YOU JUST PROVE ONE POINT WRONG THERE IN MY ANSWER...I AM ONLY AND ONLY STATING FACTS....LOVING MY COUNTRY AND STATING FACTS IS NOT "BLIND AND CLULESS"...i challenge you prove me wrong.rapist country,intolerant country.,country of slums(acrdng to them 90% slums)....if you enjoy all these abuses(which is actually far from truth)...then there is nothing to say....if not then counter my points with logical reply and not just empty rhetoric.</comment>

<comment>I gave you a fine example and you still don't understand, you couldn't even counter it. You are a total idiot to believe that our country is anywhere near to a first world country. We are 30+ years behind where China is. Anyway let me stop, you are destined to remain foolish.</comment>

<comment>moron i never said india is anywhere close to developd country...imbeciles like u will keep on fooling themselves and live in a utopian world of themseleves....what is pollution has to with rapes??...delhi has anyway always been one of the most polluted and thats a completely different issue and that is not the topic of disscusion here.....i was asking you to GIVE SOURCES TO PROVE THAT INDIA IS THE RAPE CAPTIAL OF THE WORLD...prove it that rape per capita is extremely high in india in comparison to U.K.....prove it....but you couldnt prove anything... you gave nothing to prove that  . no sources to back up your claims.yes india is laging behind them in many things..when did i deny??....i was only and only talking about this particular point.anyway leave it dont even reply.......no use talking with you.bye....................................................................................</comment>

<comment>I will not challenge you, because you want to remain as an utter and foolish idiot.Here's another example - it took an NYT writeup for our SC to wake up and force the Delhi govt to find a way to reduce pollution. Delhi had already surpassed Beijing's pollution levels but nobody gave a damn until the famous NYT story made it categorically clear that you WILL die in Delhi if you don't move out of the city.It's upto you if you think foreign countries want to 'demean' us. Surely you must be knowing your friends working in th US, some even gaining citizenship without being mistreated. But you are too stupid to understand this, you would rather listen to an illiterate chaiwallah and the truckload of lies he empties in every speech.Remain foolish, the choice is yours.</comment>

<comment>yes and yes...we have to do something about it urgently..when did i disgree???... i m only saying it hurts when  foreigner comes up and says hey ur country is a rape capital with full of rapists(to a friend of mine)...that is the impression our media is giving and that is not the truth.... this is hurting the image of india  and u r again making personal remarks... i ddnt do that.....one more personal remark and u will regret.pollution ,delhi,beijing that is not the topic here....gives nd sources nd evidences to wht you are saying.india is "not" the rape capital of world nd i gve sources to prove it now your turn....you also gve sources to prove india is the rape capital nd extremely intolerant in whole world....by just ranting out abuses you are only making a fool of yourself.just be sane and counter me logically.</comment>

<comment>ha ha , an apology by Mr Dhoklastellar Fafda, must be a rare occurrence, maybe Sun rose in West today  :)</comment>

<comment>Sometimes in the midst of running roadrollers over chaddibhakts some innocents get caught lol</comment>

<comment>By the way, he's not innocent. He's a weird problem of challenging people with lenghty write-ups - "prove me wrong" is all he says. And he has islamophobia like any other bhakt.</comment>

<comment>It seems you are obsesed with me.... losing debates again nd again seems to have taken a toll on you....haha.....stating facts is not islamophobic...my best friend is a muslim and he himself agrees wth my views...even hanuman redbutt(my friend now) and gudbella agreed with my viewpoint....ask them yourself.they are muslims nd they dont consider me islamophobic...you are ranting out against me only becoz u lost badly to me again and again.but i still respect you......</comment>

<comment>ROFL...Now you are sounding like Ultron. xD</comment>

<comment>http://replygif.net/i/1128.gif</comment>

<comment>LOL....So you are not the baddy Ultron, but the poor-thing Loki? HaHa.Anybody points to Loki - this is what comes to my mind - https://media.giphy.com/media/11rogUDDkBgcpO/giphy.gif</comment>

<comment>Haha this is what happens to bhakts who come my way lol</comment>

<comment>Ahh I see. Imagine a hard-core bhakt becoming your flight mate for a journey of 10 hours non-stop....HaHa</comment>

<comment>I don't mind pretending to be a bhakt for 10 hours to be on a non-stop flight with Dhokla to understand him.</comment>

<comment>OMG you still haven't understood me? Sob....sob....sob....boo hoooooooo</comment>

<comment>Maganti wants to analyse you psychometrically. Like, what goes into that head of yours...HaHa</comment>

<comment>A small problem, if there are traces of saffron in his blood, the results might become catastrophic</comment>

<comment>HaHa...Let Maganti deal with it. LOL</comment>

<comment>HaHa....I know, you guys will have a gala time chitchatting. There's no surprise there at all, Maganti. Liberals always do.But im more keen to see him travelling with "Obey Your Master" by the right, "Stone Cold" by the left and "Concord" somewhere nearby.....I think, he'll open the emergency door mid way and plunge down....LOL What do you say? Let's see what Dhokla has to say?</comment>

<comment>I totally agree. All women, lawyers and children below 18 will have to be barred from that flight. For added security, hands and legs of people throwing verbal muck must be tied.</comment>

<comment>Why do you keep deleting your comments?</comment>

<comment>You already replied and I didn't see it. The comment didn't make sense after looking at your reply.</comment>

<comment>Why exempt lawyers Maganti? Didn't they prove how capable they were when they thrashed people on camera? And btw, if there are no women on board bhakt testosterone levels will crash and some bhakts might go into a state of deep shock. It would be difficult to tell a monk from a bhakt in such circumstances. Bhakts need women to prove their Desh Bhakti, after all these saanvli saloni behen log are the reason they live (and die) for.</comment>

<comment>Is it really so?</comment>

<comment>Yep</comment>
