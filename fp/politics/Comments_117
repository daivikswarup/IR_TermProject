<comment>Indians elect owners rather than their rulers[president of India owns most of PSU bank and PSU shares] - which is why India is not a democracy. And Indian intellectuals press and people, are brainwashed and are insane. Socialism is legal robbery as distinct from charity. They have been insane from the days of emergency, an act of single party dictatorial terror, when socialism was introduced into constitution. Laloo and Nitish aligning with congress have exposed themselves to be terrorists.Pseudo-secularists/Socialists are biggest anti-Individualists and biggest slave drivers as seen by their imposing single party dictatorship during emergency. Fortunately India was too big and the conspiracy of the preaching Satans [Salman Rushdie has fallen into their trap] fell flat on its face.Even a robber has appetite for development. Material development should not run opposite to moral development.My main argument is either all are communal or none is communal.Look at constitution itself..India is a Ocholocracy [rule by the mob, example reservation policy; casteism is also communalism and of a worse kind as stable vote banks are formed - which has led to emancipation from democracy of political parties and state] led by the mafia [till recently we had a genuine Italian one]. IT IS A SHAME TO CALL INDIA A DEMOCRACY.Pseudo-seculars brainwash that1)Opposite of communal is secular.2)From Point 1, Logically then opposite of Individual must be religious - anabsurdity. Hence statement 1 is absurd.3)The correct antonym is Opposite of communal is INDIVIDUAL and opposite of secular is religious. Individualism comes only with CAPITALISM -positive spinoff of selfishness and profit.4)Therefore by almost Iron logic of Euclid either ALL are communal or ALL are not communal. It depends on how much India is capitalist[free economy].5)The fundamental RED communalism is therefore division between Bourgeoisie and proletariat - impeding growth of capitalism and Individualism.Reservation policy and socialism is the reason why if I were the president ofIndia, as owner of public sector banks, PSU would HANG MYSELF in abject shame.The origin of black money is constitution itself. Socialismwas introduced into constitution during emergency. It is by definition legalrobbery(as distinct from charity). Obviously objective of communists is civilwar - therfore BJP/RSS should go for all out privatization. In order to counterthe backlash, introduce free gun laws which can be very popular to fetch votes.Make buying and selling of votes legal to shatter the vote banks</comment>

<comment>All of the world is suffering because of terrorism built in Islam. We have to stay united and kick Islam out of India.99.999% of terrorists are muslims.95% of the suicide bombers are muslims.Even PUREland PAKistan is now paying the price of creating terrorists.Out of 99.9999% terrorism, Sunni muslims are responsible for 65% of world's terrorism and rest 34.9999% is by Shia.India was divided by muslims in 1947.Millions of Hindus and Sikhs were butchered by Sunni Muslims in 1947.Jinnah said all muslims will emigrate to Pakistan but they cheated Hindus, Buddhists, and Sikhs.Muslims in India multiplied 500% like pigs from 4% in 1947 to 20% today.Muslims in Pakistan butchered Hindus and killed massacred them from 24% in 1947 to 2% today.Sunny muslims in Bangladesh butchered millions of Hindus and Bengali Shia and brought down 45% hindus to 7% today.</comment>

<comment>Thank you Amar for this article.This is what Christian missionaries and Talibani Muslims want ....to create jihad in India and divide India via dividing Hindus. Chrisitans and muslims are fighting worldwide like dog and cat and sunni muslims on one side have hijacked Mohammed's religion and spreading terror while white Christians have hijacked Church and have created slavery and only white man pope in Vatican and so on. But, when it comes to India they want to divide Hindus on caste lines so that sunni muslims can divide India again and Christians can be part of it and get some states in return.Remember it were the same Christian Britishers and Muslims who divided India in the first place in 1947. If Britishers stepped up and said no division we will give you exactly like we ruled like they gave Hong Kong back to China exactly even with 100 Billion in treasury India would have been not divided today. If moderate majority muslims would have said we fought with our Hindu Buddhist Sikh brothers and we dont want division do you think India would have been divided? No way. So it clearly shows Christians and Muslims want to divide India again. Good job media in spreading the jihadi terrorism using the power of pen.</comment>

<comment>Whatever it is as per current situation because of the current incidents taking place I feel BKP will get defeated . Stupid remarks and amitshaw keeping quiet and not condemning these people immediately is giving trouble for BJP . But we cannot know what people of Bihar is up to . In case they do not believe these incidents and if they think this has been made by opposition to destroy BJP then BJP would get more than 200 . if e have to wait and watch </comment>

<comment>The biggest shock is that we were divided in 1947 even though we thought muslims were our brothers they left us, they took our land, and then left some terrorist seeds like you who claim to be our brother but take fake money from your cousins in Pakistan and bring it here to destabilize and spread terror in India. Once bitten twice shy. I dont think I can ever trust muslims any more on what they have done to Hindus Buddhists Sikhs so far. Also, if you look around they are doing the same thing worldwide. Killing Coptic Christians in Egypt. Killing Jews in Algeria. Killing Christians in Nigeria.</comment>

<comment>India opted for Hitlarian democracy when it agreed to be divided by muslims. The majority Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists were cheated by muslims. India not only lost the land to terrorist muslims they also have to carry the load of talibani muslims who stayed in India and they multiplied like pigs. Today Hitler is ruling Pakistan, majority muslims J&K gives an impression that it is hitlarian democracy and now India will be divided again by muslims. This is Indian saga.</comment>

<comment>Food inflation is at its minimum at around 3 % currently compared to 14 % during black days of congress...But only one singular issue of 'Pulses/Dal' prices is being highlighted to eclipse the overall achievements of BJP on this front..The prices of Dal have skyrocketed not due to policies of central govt. but they're a result of combined factors as -1> Record low rainfall in last year or so..2> Inability of state govts. to crack down hoarders..3> The gradual stagnation of pulses production through the years , as the population growth has overtaken the supply.....</comment>

<comment>Correct but people will not understand the reality . Nobody does not know economics .I will ask govt to introduce economics compulsorily so that people will not get fooled by opposition parties </comment>

<comment>there is no conundrum. everybody knows merit does it, which is no respecter of caste.competence, best intentions to serve the people will do it. the only party that is close to it, or attempts to come to close to it, is bjp led by namo.that is a fact, a rare fact in india royally messed up by gandhi-congressis.</comment>

<comment>Lovely joke!</comment>

<comment>impulsive denial.</comment>

<comment>Does anything you say, ever make sense?</comment>

<comment>not to some converts, i would think.</comment>

<comment>Lol seriously? The whole BJP story is based on success of caste manipulations. You realy think Modi succeded because of development? Grow up. Gujrat was growing at 15% during solanki in 1900S. During modi it never crossed 11%. The only reason BJP overthrew solanki was caste, and that alone keeps them alive.</comment>

<comment>Yeah right, congress brought in prosperity and modi defeated them 3 times with caste and people forgot all about the prosperity brought by congress. hate for bjp is making you a mental case.</comment>

<comment>get in mental asylum if u still r not inside.......</comment>

<comment>Seriously....in MP congress was reduced to 23 seats.... even tribes and sc/st people vote BJP wholeheartedly...</comment>

<comment>Let's see post VYAPAM elections!! Will BJP win in MP? I doubt it!</comment>

<comment>You doubted them when they won India. You doubted them while your son in law Robber BADra was looting India. You doubted BJP while we had 2G, 3G, CWG, SoniaG, KarthikG, JaganG, all kinds of scams. You doubt while the cats are robbing India.</comment>

<comment>Yes i doubt BJP because You even don't believe the constitution of india! </comment>

<comment>You are confused. You say I doubt BJP and then you blame me. You need to stop taking drugs of Taliban.</comment>

<comment>Can you please read my comment again, I said I doubt BJP because chaddis like you don't believe in our constitution.</comment>

<comment>I know..I am a chaddi with a cut lund with Burqa and I have many lovers since my husband has 4 wives.</comment>

<comment>Hey come on! I respect you as as Indian , all  I want from you is to be a bit tolerant when it it comes to our fellow Indians!</comment>

<comment>Respect is a two way street my friend. You need to stop calling anyone Chaddi, fascist before you think you can gain respect. I don't know where did you think that India has become intolerant. India became intolerant the day muslims after fighting with us for many years demanded their own homeland. Then the massacre of Hindus and Sikhs...in 1947 was the sign of iintolerance. Hindus and Sikhs could not show their intolerance since Gandhiji their leader sat on Ansan. Then again in 1971 30 million Hindus and Bengali Shia were butchered and massacred. We had riots from 1947 till 2002 in Gujarat and then stopped, till 1980 in Hyderabad then it stopped and in many places even now we have here and there. India became intolerant in 1984 in Sikh riots. India was intolerant when Hindu majority was made fun of and terrorist MF Hussain used his paint brush to pain Indian Goddess in bad color. Everyone on media, Bollywood, so called intellectual elite Hindus, Leftist and muslims supported him. There was no hue and cry from anyone on how he hurt the sentiments of Hindus. Did you see the media doing what it did now recently when MF Hussain was spreading terrorism using paint? How come if he is an artist he didnt paint naked Aisha or naked Prophet Mohammed or naked Virgin Mary. Artist has no religion right? So till now you keep hurting the Hindu majority in the name of Secularism (sickularism) and tolerance. When the Chicken came home to roost now you are saying India is intolerant? WOW. If as a Hindu Buddhist Christian Sikh Leftist I cannot buy land in muslim dominated J&K but a muslim from J&K can buy land anywhere in India you call it Tolerance? When as a Hindu Buddhist Christian Sikh Jain Leftist Atheist anyone cannot have more than one wife how come we still allow the Sharia law of multiple wives for each muslim man which is equal to slaving of women as per UN resolution in India? So if we ask these questions then we are intolerant huh? We are Chaddi people huh? Well then my friend so be it. I am happy to be cut lund chaddi with burqa on top of me and many lovers since my muslims husband has many wives.</comment>

<comment>Which world are you in? There were municipal elections convincingly won by BJP just recently in MP. People know the truth and they also know propaganda.</comment>

<comment>Congress again recently fought on Vyapam issue on Local Municiple election and you know after that congress wiped from ground level.  Even lost some councils where they never lost after independence.</comment>

<comment>Retarded madarssa-militant , BJP has sweeped MP elections thrice in a row due to massive overhaul they have done to grow MP's infra , living standards and general development of the local populace....even though the saga of VYAPAM dates back to 2000 ( when KHANgress was at the helm ).....</comment>

<comment>What can gay chaddis do other than name calling! BTW I don't regret calling you names coz you should know what goes around comes around(karma). For your information I'm a brahmin! </comment>

<comment>You might be Brahmin or Sunni muslim who cares but you have no right to call names. Dont forget you and your sychopancy made India run by a DIEnasty. And I am definitely never going to vote for Congress I dont care even if Sonia gives me 1 crore rupees from lacs of crores of rupees she looted and she is the 2nd richest woman in the world.</comment>

<comment>This shows your greedy.You take money to vote, not  1 crore but more than 1.5 crore.</comment>

<comment>Even if I am greedy does not change the fact that you are hiding under that white robe Christian Padre wears while your Christian Padre is molesting kids you support Sonia since she will also make you wear those white robes.</comment>

<comment>ROFLMAO.........   listen you madarssa-rodent , these tricks of wolf in sheep's skin are  too overdone to prove effective.... if you were even a Hindu  let alone so called 'Brahmin' ,you won't have chosen such insulting vulgar words for a nationalistic org. like RSS....bloody cowards hiding behind hindu names..</comment>

<comment>I can give my name, phone number and address, can you? Cowards! Hiding behind a computer you guys think you are real patriots with your fanatical attitude second next to Taliban! But in reality you are fake and cold hearted moron!</comment>

<comment>keep oinking as hard you want..... but your naivety would not swindle or pass onto anybody else......Bloody moron , to expose the reality and truth about cancer of Islam = Fanaticism......Keep living in your delusions.....coz you're the one who is real rabid antiHINDU EXTREMIST...</comment>

<comment>I'm a brahmin who performs trikala sandhya vandanam and  believe in secular values on which our constitution is enshrined but you're a cancer to sanathana dharma! India will be a better place without hate mongers like you.You're an anti-indian! </comment>

<comment>I agree that our sickular values in our Constitution treats all religion same except muslim men who are treated superior. Same sickular constitution under whose garb you allow muslim men to have multiple wives enslaving muslim women. Same sickular Constitution which does not allow muslim women same rights as muslm man where they can also have multiple lovers. Same sickular constitution bans Deepavali crackers after 10 pm one day in a year but tells you that you have no right if some foreign language Arabic mumbo jumbo is broadcasted into your house creating noise pollution 5 times a day every day. Even if you are sick, even if there is a hospital next door even if there is a school you are bombarded by this Azaan in Arabic 5 times which is the biggest noise pollution in India. And why shout in Arabic over loudspeaker...is Allah deaf? India cannot be a better place when cancer like you blame the most generous Hindus who allowed India to be divided by muslims and then lost to muslims again when they grew like pigs. You can huff and puff but we all know who is anti-Indian. Jai Hind. Vande Mataram. Here are some more facts.All of the world is suffering because of terrorism built in Islam.99.999% of terrorists are muslims.95% of the suicide bombers are muslims.Even PUREland PAKistan is now paying the price of creating terrorists.Out of 99.9999% terrorism, Sunni muslims are responsible for 65% of world's terrorism and rest 34.9999% is by Shia.India was divided by muslims in 1947.Millions of Hindus and Sikhs were butchered by Sunni Muslims in 1947.Jinnah said all muslims will emigrate to Pakistan but they cheated Hindus, Buddhists, and Sikhs.Muslims in India multiplied 500% like pigs from 4% in 1947 to 20% today.Muslims in Pakistan butchered Hindus and killed massacred them from 24% in 1947 to 2% today.Sunny muslims in Bangladesh butchered millions of Hindus and Bengali Shia and brought down 45% hindus to 7% today.</comment>

<comment>We the Hindus are equally if not more responsible for noise pollution, if you ignore this you're either ignorant or you're a fanatic! </comment>

<comment>Come on man...give me the facts and dont fart. I first need to ban Azaan as I dont want to hear noise in Arabic in my house period. Can I ban it since we are a secular country? I might be ignorant or fanatic but the fact of the matter does not change and so first how do we ban a foreign language mumbo jumbo over loudspeaker noise pollution coming into my house? Either answer that question or just admit that you are one fanatic who likes to ignore the real problem and trying to blame others. If Hindus are responsible for one day noise pollution on Deepavali, SC stepped in to control it. No more crackers after 10pm. Can SC step in and stop Azaan or just limit it to mosque with no loudspeakers? I am ok if they all day create noise with in their mosque why 5 times a day...may be 100 times a day but it has to be restricted to their own walls. It cannot penetrate my walls which is infiltration of my privacy.</comment>

<comment>Haven't you heard jarring music with more than 30 speakers from our temples, if not try visiting south India for a change! This is India and that's how we worship God ! So there can't be two set of rules for 2 different Indians belonging to different religions. Why do you support uniform civil code then! Is it a farce?</comment>

<comment>I know you are trying very hard but you dont make any sense so it's ok. 30 speakers huh? well do they blare a foreign language like Arabic? Do they blare 5 times a day? Do they care if next door is a sick or hospital?Do they do it every day or only on few days like Bakrid or ID?Do they kill others if they are not sunni?Do they worship god by only praying in the direction of Mecca? Is god only in that direction?Are there 2 sets of rules where some temple might be allowed or even SC says no fire crackers on deepavali after 10pm but can SC say no more Azaan on loudspeakers?Can SC ban Azaan on loud speakers?Did muslims get their own land and then are free to do whatever they want with pakistan?So what rights they muslims like you have once you got your pureland Pakistan?If Uniform Civil Code bans no fire crackers after 10pm on deepavali dont you think SC needs to ban these Arabaic mumbo jumbo 5 times a day/I think this is how we pray in India where we pray only in the direction of mecca even though you might be peeing in the direction of mecca.I think this is how we worship god where we think Allah is deaf so we have to use loud speakers and we have to do azaan in Arabic 5 times a day in a hindu majority country even though we divided you guys and got our land in Pakistan and Bangladesh.</comment>

<comment>Bloody MADARSSA-terrorist , antiHINDU bigoted mujhaeedin.... I am an atheist FYI and for me hinduism is my identity and civilization...So take this secular , dharma BS and punge it in your bearded arse.. coz i am not a typical brainwashed Nehruvian slave ....like you're....</comment>

<comment>I'm impressed, good to see a atheist chaddi for a change, that's if you're not lying!</comment>

<comment>I am seeing a black burqa for a change. Nice going.</comment>

<comment>Listen BURQA-chaddi , on many occasions i have given huge middle-finger to idol-worshipping , therefore restrain before making presumptions about others..Hinduism is a very old concept , hence lacks the artifice to counter the modern tools of invasion like Christainity and ISLAM....we would keep on hanging on Temple bells while the ABRAHAMIC militants would keep on eating away our land..</comment>

<comment>I thought that's what you call the chaddi unit headed by mukthar Ahmed naqvi ! How come you're an atheist and a RSS member? Is that why you hide behind a computer for the fear of your chaddis colleagues? Beware, your chaddi Taliban friends are coming for you! Still believe that you're a lying chaddi moron!</comment>

<comment>LMAO.....Madarssa-MUjhaeedin getting pi55ed when his real madarssa propaganda is being exposed...</comment>

<comment>According to you if my temple is a maarassa so be it. That shouldn't bother you coz you're a atheist! If you object to this comment of mine then it proves you're a lying torn chaddi and not an atheist!</comment>

<comment>LMAO..... you have exposed yourself Madarssa-chaddi....coz you even dont understand the real meaning of hinduism...neither have any qualms about menace of ISLAM...Hinduism isnt a religion but my identity and i have a non-discernible connection with it...and RSS are not some religious outfit...but BIGOTED madarssa-baboons like you would never get it...Forget all the propaganda being marketed by all the sides , but the FACT is that India / Hindu civilization has been half obliterated as the other half was surrendered to ISLAMIC JIHAD in form of Pakistan...But extremely diabolical Jihadi forces are even today labouring day in and out to invade , expand and convert whatever has left of India , and these nonsensical debates over 'sekoolarism' are cunning tools of that mission....So if you love your motherland , doesn't matters if you're an atheist or religious , kindly use your brain and learn for yourself that how fatal the rise in Muslim population would be for the Hindus...and akin to Pakistan if Hindus were in minority , by now we would have been well marginalized..Therefore , we have to raise conscience of every nationalistic Indian to make them aware about menace of cancer of Islam...</comment>

<comment>WHAT IS DEVELOPMENT ??? MAY SOMEBODY EXPLAIN ?Only Slogans "Black Money" , result is known to Indians, Now make in India. Ease of doing business, for what acquisition farmers land is a must( ) Poor  Indians  have to sacrifice, on the other hand the MNCs who will invest India, their character are also to be judged, in this respect the following news can be considered "There was a time when these royalty payments were regulated. But they were removed to make India friendlier to foreign investment. In the process, the corporates have become indifferent, hostile even, to the interests of domestic stakeholders. And now, unreasonably high royalty payments instead are leading to capital flight.""And companies like Maruti Suzuki India are likely to struggle with answers. Consider this: While royalties in FY15 for Maruti accounts for 5.2% of sales, the R&D expense is barely .01%. Compared to a 15% compound growth rate (CAGR) in operating profits over last decade, the royalties have grown at a CAGR of 30%." Ram knows what is the fate of poor Indian voters ( ) It was reported Allowing Onion sale at exorbitant rate the businessmen have earned extra profit of Rs 8000 crore, and by taking late action to curb black marketing of Pulses how much extra profit has been earned by "Make in "India pepole" is not known to general mass ( )</comment>

<comment>Thank U ( ) Thanks also for patiently go through the content ( )</comment>

<comment>Leftist like you who supported white fascist Sonia's government full of Chumchas you didnt stand or speak up while our country was looted. You didnt stand up while our country was sold out. Now, if Indians elect a new PM after getting tired of being looted for 70 years by CONgress you talk about some pulses or some Maruti. Dont forget Maruti was started by your own CONgress Indira's son Sanjay. So stop finding mole and making it a mountain.</comment>

<comment>Quite true.  The so-called development messiahs became jittery after the RSS Chief contentious statement on reservations  and had to make a hasty retreat to  declare before hand that their Chief Minister will definitely not be a upper caste candidate,  which is unprecedented by any standards and cynical caste display at its worst.  Not only this, the so-called unfettered market economy messiahs and flag bearers of neo-liberal Capitalist model who have utter disregard to poor and fancies the Jungle Raj culture of "Survival of the fittest" had to distribute scooties, lap tops, etc.,  as allurements to induce voters ahead of polls.  Their own Party MP in Bihar accused them of complete commercial sale of tickets to dynasts, boot leggers, turn coats, criminals and money bags thereby sidelining party faithfuls which yet again exposed the lewdness of the so-called party with a difference which can stoop to any level to gain power where ethics, principles and morality always takes a back seat !!The harsh reality in the Bihar assembly elections is that it is the Janata Parivar which is setting the agenda and the BJP panickingly reacting to it making a mockery of itself.  It is clearly rattled by the sheer arithmetic strength and caste power  of its opponents !!</comment>

<comment>An out of box thought process contradicting what main stream media claim: With the lynching and the killing of Muslims by RSS elements, with the incendiary rhetoric / divisive statements of Haryana CM, BJP Union Ministers, BJP Law Makers, MPs and MLAs; it is quite natural that Muslims have turned away from BJP.Thus BJP has become lame duck deprived from almost one crore and twenty five lakh Muslim Votes from Bihar, almost 20% vote not available to BJP.RSS Chief's reminder to BJP to review the current reservation policy has turned away the OBC, EBC, SC and ST from BJP. This way, BJP is now deprived of the majority of 65% of Bihar population, more than 4 Crores of Bihari votes.With APND Modi making only Jumla, the general mass has turned away from BJP. All the people waited for Rs. 15 Lakhs for one-and-a half year instead they have got daal at Rs. 200 per kg.Biharis, mostly the poor, the deprived, the hand to mouth are furious at Modi for he follows crony capitalism and he has shun the constitutional duty of following the co-operative socialism!Only that particular class of people who dominated Bihar politics, prior to Mandal, majority of the ex-congressmen, and now have joined BJP in the hope of ruling Bihar again will automatically vote for BJP. This is the solid 15% vote bank of BJP - all weather ready, ever ready vote bank.BJP has logically given more than 50% of seats to this class. Interesting to note that the party with a difference, who abuse other political parties of minority apeasement and minority vote bank politics is performing same. Lesson - Is hamaam mein sab nangen hain!Encounter King of Gujarat, Amit Shah is using every Kautaliya Neeti in Bihar election, sam, dam, dand, vibhed. He recognised that dam works best in Bihar. And I learnt that BJP is distributing among the Bihari electorates Rs.10, 000 Crores. But this amount may fetch the BJP close to one Crore votes only. Since BJP needs at least 2.5 Crore votes in Bihar, its appropriately right time that BJP increases the amount to be distributed to Rs. 25, 000 Crore before it is too late!As if stationing half of the union cabinet ministers and most of the BJP MPs in Patna is not considered sufficiently enough for campaign, BJP is ringing danger bells demanding law makers from BJP ruled states to increase the quantum of the campaign but the sore outcome is that the Bihari electorates are refusing to listen to these Baharis, the outsiders.May be additional laws of Chanakya Neeti need to be applied. Last but not least: Wise ex-RSS Pracharak said: “If RSS ‘really’ (emphasis on ‘really’) wants you to win an election, almost no power on earth can stop you from winning an election!”Therefore Encounter King Amit Shah and Ham Panch Hamare Pachees Narendra Modi must drop every thing and run to Nagpur and beg RSS Chief to issue a Fatawa, a Firman to the RSS members to join the prachar lest Bihar 2015 becomes India 2004, 2009 fiasco!</comment>

<comment>Mohammad Yousuf where were you when muslims who fought with Hindus Buddhists Christians Sikhs Jains as our brothers divided India and took pound of flesh with them a large land. Where were majority muslims then? Where were you when the left over muslims 4% multiplied like 20% today changing the proportions and again you majority muslims are creating problems. Where were you when the intolerance started under Sonia and when MF Hussain painted Hindu goddess in a bad picture. Did you step up and oppose it. Didn't your muslim MF Hussain did not paint naked Aisha or Mohammed or naked Virgin Mary or Jesus? Where were you then? Where were you when Hindus and Sikhs were massacred in 1947 by your muslim brothers?</comment>

<comment>5. We Indians got rid of notorious MF Hussain from India when he hurt thesentiment of Hindus.6. On your last statement. I have replied earlier that it was weak being killed by strong. Visit Delhi, UP. Haryana, Panjab to learn how weak Muslims were massacred, how weak Muslim women were raped, how weak Muslim women were abducted. Same thing happened with weak Hindus in Pakistan and Bangla Desh. It was a naked dance of hate killing with ulterior motive of grabbing the properties and livelihood of weak, the minority Hindus, the minority Muslims, and the minority Sikhs.At end, you will recognize that it pays to make bridges, to be peaceful and to be the standard bearer of peace. And without peace we will fail in sustaining the India growth story!One big riot and we will go back a decade in our pursuit to become a permanent member of UN. One big riot and we will go back a decade in our economy. Presently we are competing with US economy, China economy but that will become a pipe-dream if 20 Crore Muslims are demonized, if communalism is practiced: Sab Kaa Saath, India Kaa Vikaas!India can go on with its growth trajectory if every citizen has equal opportunity to compete in India building, no discrimination based on religion, gender and so forth.As you are from an upper caste, Mandal is hurting you but there is no choice! There will be blood-bath, and as you are in minority, you will lose heavily. 2/2</comment>

<comment>Yousuf Bhai you divided Indian nah? You got your own land na? You called it PUREland Pakistan na? Jinnah said all muslmis will emigrate to Pakistan na? SO what are you doing in Hindu majority India na? Jinnah while dividing India clearly said all muslims will emigrate to Pakistan.You will also serve the purpose of your birth if you use your Sanskrit name rather than an Arabic name for you are hurting the sentiments of your parents and ancestors who gave you your name. Do you know that 99% of all of you were Hindus from ancestry so time has come for you to come back to your original religion. Just check the DNA and you will realize you were after all Hindus.You will also achieve the purpose of your life if you write truth avoiding the fictions, the myth, the perceptions. But, for you in Islam it is more important is to blow themselves up so that you can get 72 virgins. Do you know that 95% of suicide bombers are muslims?1. It is well documented that many people wanted partition due to multiple factors and one of these is that Patel wanted partition; But none, I repeat none got partition or were able to divide. Only muslms were the one who fought with us as our own brothers and sisters and come 1947 they divided India under Jinnah. Wanting is one thing doing the actual division is another. It does not matter what I want or what I think at the end the fact of the matter is that it is desh drohie namak haram Jinnah and those Muslims who divided India. It is also well documented that Jinnah said all muslims need to emigrate to Pakistan and still he cheated and left people like you in India for others (Hindu Buddhist Christians Jains Sikhs) to carry your Islamic load.2. It is well documented that stronger killed weak, be it Lahore, be it Calcutta, be it Decca and be it Delhi. I checked the facts and found out that muslims butchered millions of Hindus and Sikhs in 1947 and then Gandhiji went on Ansan before Hindus and Sikhs can kill all of you guys. This is the reason we are still left with so many muslims in India even though you got your land in Pureland Pakistan. Check the facts. None no patel no bureaucracy got their own land except muslims who majority stood up with Jinnah and cheated others and got their own land.3. India Census data 1947, shows 14% muslims where 10% muslims got 33% of Indian land and rest 4% stayed in India. I checked these facts and now I realize that you have grown whopping 500% from that 4% to 20% today like ants. Why do we even allow 4 wives and 12 kids from each wife to muslims. Why not we say everyone can only have one wife and 2 kids.4. Population growth rate in India is NOT directly proportional to the economic strata of the society. And lets not talk about this caste or that sect like sunni. In fact, Sunni have outgrown and have grown more than Aga Khani, Bohri, Shia and others. Hinduism in India is in danger is a plain truth since history has shown that when ever muslims grow into majority the first thing they do is divide. Are you growing this way because multiple wives and 12 kids from each of them?5. Muslims never stood up to notorious MF Hussain and he left India on his own even though he hurt the sentiment of Hindus. Muslim intelligentia class didnt even have the courage to vehemently opposed MF Hussain. Off course MF Hussain didnt have the courage to paint naked Fatima or Aisha or naked Mohammed or naked Virgin Mary. DId you muslims stand up to Owaisi when he spread the venom? Instead you vote for him. So dont even tell me such thing as moderate muslim or intelligentia. There is no such thing in Islam.6. It was weak Hindus being killed by strong muslims. Hindus in Pakistan and Bangla Desh. It was a naked dance of hate killing with ulterior motive of grabbing the properties and livelihood of weak, the minority Hindus, minority Sikhs, minority Bengali Shia. Not only in 1947 but also in 1971 Sunni muslims butchered and massacred millions 30 million Hindus and Bengali Shia in Bangladesh. Facts are that 24% of Hindus have been butchered and massacred in Islamic Pakistan to 2% of Hindus and Christians. Facts are that 45% of Hindus in Bangladesh have been reduced to 7%. And facts are that in Hindu majority India weak muslims have multiplied from 4% to 20% thus destroying the understanding of 1947 when muslims got their own land and rest of India belonged to others Hindu Majority, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and others. Do you know that muslims after getting Pakistan became Islamic. Hindu majority also had a choice and by choice became Secular. Lets keep and respect Hindus else if you are going to marginalize Hindus like CONgress did then why should Hindus opt to be secular...lets make sure we dont marginalize Hindus that this secular become sickular.At end, I agree that it pays to make bridges, to be peaceful and to be the standard bearer of peace. And without peace we will fail in sustaining the India growth story! India cannot grow as long as Islam continue to grow faster than other races. Muslims will continue to be economically backward when it is difficult to maintain a family of one wife and 2 kids where as muslims are having 4 wives and 12 kids from each total of 53 people in one family instead of 4 in hindu or christians or Sikh or Buddhist family.One big riot and we will go back a decade in our pursuit to become a permanent member of UN. One big riot and we will go back a decade in our economy. Presently we are competing with US economy, China economy but that will become a pipe-dream if 80 Crore Hindus are demonized and marginalized at the hands of Christian white skin fascist vatican dominated Sonia and her cronies of muslim sychopants and terrorists like Azam Khan and Owaisi and Bukhari, if communalism is practiced: Sab Kaa Saath, India Kaa Vikaas!India can go on with its growth trajectory if every citizen has equal opportunity to compete in India building, no discrimination based on religion, gender and so forth. We all have to be Indians first and Hindu or muslim second. If you agree then we need a Uniform Civil code. No more ...if a Hindu man or Christian man or Buddhist man or a Sikh man is caught with more than one wife or vice versa if a Hindu woman or a Christian woman or a or a Sikh woman or a Buddhist woman or a MUSLIM WOMAN is caught with more than one husband then it is illegal. No more pampering of muslim man. No more Hajj subsidy where all tax payers are paying for muslims to go to mecca by Saudia while no Hindu no Buddhist no Sikh no Christian gets paid to go to their holy land. No more discrimination against Hindu majority by muslim minority.No more upper caste lower cast no more Sunni or Shia or no more muslim man versus Hindu man. All are equal. Jai Hind. Vande Mataram.</comment>

<comment>Mr. Swarna Islamophobe:You have clearly given clear evidence that you refuse  to use your brain, you refuse to use your faculty of reasoning, and you refuse to apply your mind since you are a hard-core brainwashed bigoted HindutvaWadi ManuWadi Swarna Islamophobe!People like you who practice polarising the society of our land that celebrates its cultural diversity, plurality, tolerance will be defeated soon.I have found that swarnas like you constitute 6% of Hindu population of India. I have also found out that remaining 94% of India Hindu population who are non-swarnas are believing in India's cultural diversity, plurality, tolerance and they maintain good relationship with Muslims.Modi said let Muslims and Hindus stop fighting between themseves  and unitedly fight the poverty.Mr. Swarna, reflect on the statement you make to that Modi made! Do you find fallacy, inconsistency, untenability, unsustainity, impractiality?20 Crore Muslims are part of India, you have to live with this fact of life, otherwise your hate-mongering Islamophoby will come back to you. Observation: Hard-core brainwashed bigoted HindutvaWadi ManuWadi Swarna Islamophobes like you are responsible for BJPs solid drubbing in Bihar election 2015.ABCD, an acronym that befits BJP's Bihar election strategy you stand at C.Aarakshan, Beef, Caste (Communalism), Daal: Bihar’s ABCD.</comment>

<comment>Dear Yoursuf Bhai, I keep calling you bhai because of my cultural roots and respect for others and you keep calling me Islamphobe and brainwashed bigoted and so on. Is it because of your Islamic background where you only know how to be violent and is terrorism embedded in Islam that you cannot even respectfully and logically debate? Will then you become Khafir the moment you debate or question Islam's teaching and then Sunni like they do in ISIS will cut your neck?You talk about the society of our land that celebrates its cultural diversity, plurality, tolerance but that was 1947. I do agree that muslim brothers and sisters fought the war of independence with Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist, Jain, Buddhist, and all other brothers. Then what happened in 1947? How come suddenly you muslims wanted to divide India and what happened that muslim majority didnt stand up to Jinnah and told him that you dont want to separate with your Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh brothers as this is the country of cultural diversity, plurality and tolerance. What happened that you majority muslims not only divided Hindustan when your own Jinnah and your majority muslims said you cannot live with Hindu majority. You want me to put Jinnah's speeches here to bring back what you muslims said? If muslim majority believed in cultural diversity, plurality, and tolerance they would have stood up to Jinnah and not let India divide. Right? So there you go...there is no way majority muslims are non-violent or peaceful.What happened to that cultural diversity, plurality, and tolerance when you muslims butchered and massacred millions of Hindus and Sikhs in 1947. They could not even retaliate as our leader Gandhiji stood up and went on Ansan and majority Hindus didnt believe in butchering back. Else you would not have been writing here as you would have been wiped out in the backlash fury of Hindus and Sikhs. Hindus were far generous in giving you 10% of the muslims 33% of the land based on Jinnah's words that all muslims will emigrate to Pakistan. Then what happened? Pakistan had a choice and majority muslims decided to make Pakistan Islamic. Majority Hindu decided to be Secular even though they could have become Hindu country just like your Pakistan and Bangladesh became Islamic.You muslims demanded your own land, divided India, and you became Islamic Pakistan and left India for majority Hindus. It was the generosity of Hindus that they let you 4% stay here and it was due to Hindu generosity that you were able to multiply like pigs from 4% in 1947 to 20% today...which is whopping 500%. There by, you have already started to become majority in few areas of India and just waiting to talk all this mumbo jumbo of being brothers of Hindus before you find another Jinnah in Azam Khan or Owaisi or Bukhari and divide India again. On the other hand the same so called muslim brothers killed and massacred and butchered 24% Hindus in Islamic Pakistan to 2% Hindus and Christians today. Same Islamic Bangladesh butchered and massacred Hindus from 45% in 1947 to 7% today. You probably going to call me Islamophobia while you muslims are butchering Hindus and Christians and Buddhists and Jews worldwide.So called muslims like you who talk about cultural diversity, plurality what happened to you guys when you butchered 30 million Bengali Hindus and Bengali Shia in 1971? Did you forget what is the meaning of cultural diversity and plurality at that time? or you just use it when it is convenient and you use terrorism when it is convenience.I am glad that found that swarnas like me and remaining 94% of India Hindu population who are non-swarnas are believing in India's cultural diversity, plurality, tolerance and they maintain good relationship with Muslims. But, on the other hand I also found out that majority muslims are satans and they will talk about this mumbo jumbo brother and sister till they are in minority and then as soon as you are in majority you do exactly opposite of what you said and then suddenly you dont believe in diversity, plurality, and tolerance and you start to butcher and  massacre minorities like Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, and Jews.I dont care what Modi said or didnt say. He is a duly elected PM of majority Hindu India and I respect our democracy where as I look around and I dont see any democracy in any muslim countries.I agree that stupid Hindus let you grow from 1.5 crores in 1947 to 20 Crore Muslims today just because they still think that you are a peace loving religion but history, current situation is showing that you are opposite of it.Observation:99.9999% of world's terrorists are muslims.95% of all suicide bombers are muslims.</comment>

<comment>Quran commands Universal brotherhood! I do consider you my brother in humanity!At the same time, by nature and by the training imparted on me by my teachers, almost 100% of them Hindus,  I am inclusive. This inclusiveness and universal brotherhood aspects in me strengthened when I read Qur'an.I am against any discrimination based on nation, tribe, race, religion, gender, caste, culture and so forth. Quran 49:13</comment>

<comment>Mr. Islamophobe Amar-uddin!1. You are shameless to assume a Muslim name though you are a hard-core blind bigoted brain-washed HindutvaWadi vigilante Islamophobe!2. You are 100% wrong that Muslims fought with the rest. If you have any honesty in you, go to Delhi and you will learn how millions of Muslims were massacred by Hindu extremists. You go to Haryana, Punjab, UP, and other parts of India, minority Muslims were killed byFact of the matter is that the majority killed the minority, the strong decapicitated the weak. This is story irrespective of topology of India.</comment>

<comment>Mohammed Bhai, you got your land na in Pakistan. You divided us na? Now what the fuq are you doing in India yaar? You got your own fuqing land in Pakistan.. You are shameless you divided India and you still stayed here like a thankless beggar. And you are just like your ISIS brothers....hard core bigoted brain washed sunni muslim who claim everyone else is Islamophobe but you dont mind blowing yourself to get voluptuous gorgeous 72 whores in hell.2. How can muslims are massacred yaar. We were ready to massacre but this Gandhi sat on Ansan after you guys took our land and then massacred millions of Hindus and Sikhs.3. I agree with you that the majority killed the minority but in Pakistan though. You massacred and butchered Hindus from 24% in 1947 to 2% today. So I agree with you.4. If we could have massacred you and since Hinduism is not a religion like yours Islam which is a religion of terrorists we allowed you to multiply like pigs from 4% in 1947 to 20% today.</comment>

<comment>Here is how  so called innocent misguided muslims killed RSS/Bajrang dal members in secular Congressi ruled state at them same time of DadriAnd TV media is still silent on this issue....after all patience has also limits... such blatant appeasements from political leader are testing patience of majority..http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/mangalore-man-who-forced-closure-of-abattoir-is-hacked-to-death-8-held/</comment>

<comment>Irrespective which religion one is from, everyone and anyone taking law in one's hand must be punishes.Let the law of the land prevail.Let peace prevail!</comment>

<comment>You are right but media selective outage is creating strong wave of anger... and also when a muslim or dalit is killed every opportunist politician rushes to them to make is political issue.</comment>

<comment>I think BJP would win in Bihar but by a narrow margin around (125-130 seats.. )But all the obstacles in the path of BJP are self-created problems due to lack of effective counter to the falsehoods spread by media and opposition...Here is the situation where in a state election , entire  narrative is build  around performance of 1 yr old central govt rather than absolute abysmal failure of 3 decades old RJD+CONG+JDU camp...Media has quite shrewdly spun the discourse to favour their 'sekoolar' masters but ultimately ppl of Bihar would show them the big middle finger..</comment>

<comment>True 'dat..BJP is going to win Bihar hands down but the question is by how much..as for the Nitish being humble, ROFL..yea, if cows started flying over the moon that probably may have a whisker of a chance of coming true. The Media, it is true, is biased against the NDA in bihar but what was more telling was when the same media kept haranguing voters as to whom they voted for, the resounding answer was "BJP"..much to the chagrin of these media houses..which in itself is telling.</comment>

<comment>Bihar is all about caste votes. Everything else is later...</comment>

<comment>Really machchi? Isn't development agenda a flop to the people of Bihar?</comment>

<comment>Looks like that. No one with dev agenda will ever vote for laloo...</comment>

<comment>When Modi ji fails to convince the people, you are blaming the voters now machi. Typical habit of Chaddis.</comment>

<comment>You yourself accepted that ppl are not voting for dev agenda. Typical jalra machi nee. Where is the abuse here? Ppl are voting only by caste...</comment>

<comment>You are a hypocrite machchi. When Modi ji got a big victory in 2014 LS election in Bihar, you didn't say that people voted for Caste.How did the people change from dev to caste in a year?</comment>

<comment>You are a liar machi. When did I say in 2014 that bihar did not vote by caste?Why don't you stop being a cry baby and act mature?</comment>

<comment>To be precise, in 2014 people voted for their caste and  Modi ji won. In 2015, again people are voting for their caste and Modi ji loses.Your caste logic seems to be a fake machi.</comment>

<comment>Loosa machi nee? Voting  pattern always changes by election type. Bihar did vote by caste in 2014. The options they had was modi vs congis. Local parties like jdu never even had a chance. Take delhi for example. In ls modi swept but in assembly they lost miserably. I don't understand why you try to blame others as bhakts when you have zero knowledge about practicality? </comment>

<comment>Again , you are wrong machi. When BJP won in MH during LS polls, you (Bhakts) said that it was because of Modi. When BJP won in MH assembly elections , you said that it was because of Modi. Why didn't the election type make changes here? The point applies to Hariyana and a few other states too.</comment>

<comment>What is the point of discussion here? I thought it was whether bihar votes caste based. Why are you running away from that? Comparing ls to asmbly is stupid...</comment>

<comment>Machchi, you are totally confused. You said that Bihar votes for caste. I proved you that if the caste voted for Modi ji in 2014, the same caste didn't vote for him in 2015. Then, you came up with different logic that LS and Assembly elections are different. I showed you the figure of MH.Eventually, you have no point and rubbished the argument by saying "Stupid" . It's too late machi for me to sleep. Good Night, see you tomorrow.</comment>

<comment>Machi, you proved nothing. Your point of 2014 vs 15 is invalid. That was ls vs asmbly. Bihar still voted by caste. Just that except so called minorities everyone voted for modi due to lack of choices...</comment>

<comment>If bihar does caste politics why rest of country  should suffer with our taxes going towards special package and rest of india has to accept these migrants to their states, where they will settle down with demands of all and sundry</comment>

<comment>RSS commented that caste with power and strength is trying to take reservation system to its own advantage,didnot even spell abt ending it , nitish kumar is just doing caste politics with these lines ...........his only agenda these days seems to be caste and reservation and not talks of development.........mature bihar voters shud reject these thoughts and vote fr country rather than caste,  ....</comment>

<comment>Just like how appetite for prestitutism works in tandem with congress</comment>
