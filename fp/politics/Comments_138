<comment>one of the silver lining of pm modi winning the election 2014  was the SLOW but sure death of caste ism and caste leaders and no were will it be apparent then in bihar elections the people of bihar want progress and development the only people who are intrested in petty caste and community are the casteist leaders and their chamchas in the sickular media like sardesai the young people of bihar have already turned their backs on sickular kumar chara chor and also fake dalit leaders like paswan and manjhi it will be a bjp victory only and only because of pm modi </comment>

<comment>Intelligent Biharis ! Don't lose the opportunity to catch up with other progressive BJP ruled states like Maharastra, MP, Chattisgarh etc., Modi is the only solution for India for the next 10 to 15 years. He has no personal interests like other leaders and No ambitions to amass wealth. He has proved this in the last 20 years with no charges of corruption against him. He is a KARMAYOGI.  Congress will disappear after this elections and the country will begin to prosper .with the exit of Congress. BJP WILL HAVE ABSOLUTE MAJORITY IN RAJYA SABHA BY END 2016. THAT IS THE TIME TE GOLEN PERIOD FOR INDIA REALLY STARTS. Let BIhar also have its prosperous days ahead with BJP ruling the state. BEWARE BIHARIS! DONT LOSE THIS GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN THE BEST STATES OF INDIA. ELECT BJP AND LET BIHAR PROSPER !</comment>

<comment>Nitishji is a better leader. Any meaningful change requires time. I believe things will improve further if he stays in power.Narendra Modi has done little so far. The BJP also does not have any face in Bihar. This is not a good sign as far as the leadership question is concerned.Modi will impose his stooge upon Bihar, if the BJP comes to power. Nitish, on the other hand, is a self-made and independent leader.</comment>

<comment>No doubt Nitish is a good man and an able administrator. But the company he is associated is condemanable.He could have won big if he has stood alone. His association the looter Laloo will lead to his downfall. He will be an unknown entity after this election, thanks to the company he keeps like Laloo, scamster congress etc.,Modi is the only choice for Bihar and India. Otherwise Bihar will be doomed if they elect a non BJP govt.</comment>

<comment>The leadership question is already answered in Maharashtra,Haryana and Jharkhand...they got the answer in Delhi when leader was not Modi...Modi appointed his stooge in Jharkhand and ppl of Bihar knows how Jharkhand is doing now..thanks for the gr8 "concern"..being a retard and a supporter of a bigger retard definitely for you 15 months is greater than 10 yrs</comment>
