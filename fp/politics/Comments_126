<comment>The government offices may not have even documents. When such crime are committed, the tracks also get wiped out so in case of challenge nothing can found! Friend who has approached the court for some stolen land. When the plaintiff approached to Development officer, he was told that office do not have original maps submitted with application to convert agricultural land to non agricultural land! As common lot is being use by some influential politician to build huge building for self benefit!</comment>

<comment>National Herald case in a nut shell simply Explained to a common man..National herald (NH) was started during 1930s by nehru and was publishing news paper. During the course of time it accumulated land and wealth of 5000crs. In 2000s it went into loss and had 90crs debt. NH's directors Sonia ,Rahul, and Motilal vohra decided to sell it to Young India Ltd. Now the funny part. Young India's directors were Sonia, Rahul, Oscar farnandes and motilal vohra. Deal was that young India would clear NH's 90cr loan and in return get assets worth 5000 cr. To strike this deal motilal vohra spoke to motilal vohra bcoz he was director of both companies.Now comes the twist.To clear the 90 cr debt, young Indian, asks Congress party to give loan of 90 cr. So congress calls a meeting , party president, VP, gen sec, treasurer attends it. Who are these ppl ?? Sonia, Rahul, Oscar and motilal vohra respectively. Congress gives loan. Who approves it, treasurer,motilal vohra. So congress treasurer vohra, gives loan to young India, its director vohra takes it and gives it to NH director vohra.Hold on the fun doesn't stop here. Next day congress party calls meeting, who attends it ?? Sonia, Rahul, Oscar, vohra . they decide that NH has done lot of service to the country during freedom fight, let's write off the loan. So 90cr loan is written off. Great. Young India with 36% share held be sobia and Rahul each , rest owned by Oscar and vohra gets property worth 5000cr, including 11 stories flat at bahadur shah zafar marg in Delhi, which is rented out to passport office and other offices.Wow this is what is called creation. Creating everything out of nothing. 5000crs out of thin air!!!!</comment>
