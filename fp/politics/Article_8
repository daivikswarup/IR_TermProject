New Delhi: BJP on Friday kept up its attack on Congress over David Headley's deposition that Ishrat Jahan, who was killed in 2004, was an LeT terrorist, accusing it of "whitewashing" facts due to its "congenital dislike" for Narendra Modi because it foresaw him as a "political threat".Representational image. ReutersSeeking an apology from Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, then Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and other party leaders lined up to "weave a fictional tale" to target Modi, then Gujarat Chief Minister, BJP also virtually defended the police personnel arrested for killing Ishrat in an alleged fake encounter in 2004, saying the then UPA government made sure they were put behind bars."A battery of Congress leaders were lined up who went on giving statements there are evidences (against BJP leaders), there are conversations happening, there are people who said the man with white beard and black beard. It was done because Congress has a congenital dislike for Modi."He much to their dislike was the state's chief minister. Who much to their dislike ran the state so successfully that they foresaw a potential political threat to themselves and so they targeted him... They wove theories like white beard, black beard," Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said at a party briefing.References to 'white beard' and 'black beard' were made in leaked telephonic conversations of police personnel and others related to the case and BJP's rivals had then alleged that they meant Modi and then state home minister Amit Shah, now party chief. BJP had called it a conspiracy by the UPA government to target them.Ishrat Jahan case: Former Home Secy GK Pillai claims 'political' interference in 2004 encounterIshrat Jahan case: Congress' only objective seems to be to harass Gujarat governmentIshrat Jahan encounter: GK Pillai's 'affidavit' claim sparks political rowAttacking Congress, she said when its ploy did not work, then a senior Intelligence Bureau official was "targeted" and the Special Director-rank officer was subjected to questioning by a DSP-rank CBI official."To what extent the dislike of Congress for individuals could guide its policy and governance and expose the national security.
