<comment>In this election i supported bjp earlier i supported jdu. By the way i m bramhin by birth and have no taker.</comment>

<comment>This election has proves that caateism is very strong </comment>

<comment>This election has proved that muslims will remain what they are and will always vote against bjp. So no.point asking them to join rank. Modi now must act as a hindu ruler to make his stamp secularism is not for bjp</comment>

<comment>We know what is best for us. You are a BJP supporter so no surprises about your arrogance.</comment>

<comment>There is only one lesson from these elections. And that isopposition needs to group their votes to defeat Modi. Proof is as below1)     In Delhi we saw BJP just got 3 seats inre-election inspite of the vote share almost being the same as the firstelection (32%). In this case all Congress votes went to AAP, Congress gotdecimated and AAP won. There was no pre-poll alliance in this case but AAP gotlucky because Congress voters deserted it.2)     In case of Bihar opposition took no chances andmade a pre-poll alliance of everyone opposed to Modi. Even when AAP wasn’tcontesting it supported the opposition. BJP with 25% of the votes and singlelargest party lost to RJD (18.7%) + JDU (16%) and Congress (6%).Modi and BJP would need to do a better job with developmentagenda to get more people to support BJP or not be over-confident and get properallies and not go fighting out on their own.The good thing is it doesn’t end with just the elections andNitish will now have the tough job to govern with Laloo and Congress. Peoplewill realise soon that such governments end up with lot of scams.</comment>

<comment>Bihari people lost themselves to chara chor lallu and mega looter of poor mans hard earned money Congress..... They wil tbink they won and their caste creed will be better off... </comment>

<comment>Caste has won in Bihar. Development has lost. All the best for the people of Bihar.</comment>

<comment>No lazy people who have not voted let down Bihar in the real sense.Paswan and Manjhi they did their best.</comment>

<comment>No the caste politics has lost. Why did BJP gave so many seats to Ramvilas Paswan (LJP), Upendra Kushwaha's party (RLSP) and Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM). What credibility they had in politics and governance except they belong to the castes which BJP was targeting to capture. First time since Indian independence a PM has tried to talk about his caste to get the vote. Lost miserably, didn't they?Bihar has completely rejected caste politics.</comment>

<comment>Without caste politics, Lalu could not have won. He got Yadav vote bank right. Anyway, the will of the people of Bihar is supreme. If they are happy with this, then we salute them.</comment>

<comment>BJP given ticket to highest numbers of criminals in Bihar election as per ADR report </comment>

<comment>Their leaders Shah and Modi ji Both belong to that catagory</comment>

<comment>Biggest loser of this election is the people of Bihar who are now going to be ruled/remote-controlled by a known corrupt and convicted criminal. Continuous mass exodus of Biharis to all parts of India says a lot about state of affairs of Bihar. Tell me which Industry, company wants to set up its offices there? NONE.Second biggest loser is Nitish Kumar. His party won 112 seats in 2010, in this election those numbers have come down to 71. Most of his share has gone to who, his staunch enemies Laloo and Congress, who he has opposed all his life.  In less than 2 months, he will force Nitish to make is sons deputy chief ministers. He would have been chief minister even if he has allied with BJP.Laloo got higher than that.Bigger blot on the the face of mother India is that no matter how much one wants to talk about development, some stinky political parties supported by our corrupt media drags them to mud.Tell me what was the promise of Mahagathbandhan, secularism? Did anybody show any vision? NO! Now, most of us will watch how another 5 years become lost 5 years in Bihar's history.</comment>

<comment>Bihar always gave direction to the nation. Buddha, Ashoka and Mahavira of Bihar gave the country the message of peace and tolerance on which the foundation of the country and its civilisation was laid. Jai Prakash Narayan and his anti-emergency agitation started in Bihar. The advani rath was stopped in Bihar when the whole country was waiting for all the riots to end and when all the peace loving people of India including President of India and all the intellectuals were waiting for Bihar to give an answer to the hatred spread by RSS/BJP/Traitors, Bihar responded again and gave the befitting answer.Discard/ignore Bihar's mandate at your own peril. This is where the idea of India was born and this is where we will protect it no matter what happens.</comment>

<comment>But Biharies have to go to other states for jobs.That also seems to be the great teaching of gurus u have mentioned. It may be a document unwritten like Magna Carta faithfully pursued under social engineering scheme of Bihar Politics.If we extend the logic to all India Indians have to go from place to place soon like nomads. The days are not too far..You are a good fortune teller. .</comment>

<comment>Stop this bihar always did that or not. We will judge by what it didi now. It tried to save bihar ki asmita to a chara looter.  Can you imagine.  He and mega looter Congress will loot whatever is left in poor man pocket </comment>

<comment>True and all xshit polls churning bullshit </comment>

<comment>I am a bhakt and I always said Delhi & Bihar are good losses for BJP. People hated me for that but here is what I told them.AAP is a bubble best place it explodes is in Delhi municipality. AAP now exposed in Delhi. No one thinks of it as a national force. That only leaves opposition with Nitish. I have respect for the man but his choice of Lalu is poor. Now in 4yrs Nitish will be ruined by Lalu. Unity bubble & Nitish bubble will burst. This means Modi is unchallenged till 2029.Moreover Nitish with 20-30 seats from Bihar was never going to be the PM. These are wet dreams of sickulars. All others Mamta, Maya, Jaya, Biju, Mulayam, Pawar have no national appeal, get 20-30 seats,  if they leave their states for center they will be finished in their states. Not to mention some of them are close to being old & out with no credible replacement. Unless one party can get 150-200 seats this motley team of leaders won't do Modi any harm. There is no such party. Pappu cant get 150 seats.As long BJP delivers in the states it rules now BJP is fine for 2019. For 2024 it would be nice to win UP. Addiotnally, SP & BSP wont unite. Mamta and Left wont either. So relax.The battle is lost but the war has been WON!!</comment>

<comment>First time in history of India got honest gov of AAP . Delhi municipality is running by corrupt MCD of BJP not AAP. BJP will never win against AAP in Delhi now just wait for Delhi MCD election of 2017. And in Bihar Nitish won because of his 10 years development not for his jumla </comment>

<comment>6 ministers in Jail. Not by choice but because law caught up with them. AAP is over. You used Bhushans, Yadav etc. Your over. MCD election who cares. At this rate you will be in Delhi in 2050.Nitish did perform but tying up with Lalu means it's time up!!!</comment>

<comment>Wrong strategy of not naming a local CM candidate. Mohan Bhagwat's utter foolishness on reservations issue and talking up the bullSh**t beef issue were the root causes for the BJP defeat. But also this is the first election where it was BJP Vs. The rest....and BJP has practically become the old congress party which used to dominate the center. Modi has to play his cards carefully and position BJP as the central force...For next few decades it looks like BJP Vs. the rest...whch is a good thing.</comment>

<comment>as i said to xyz---Rahul never though AAP will win in Delhi. Have u not figured that out by now. Rahul says irrelevant things and hallucinates from drugs he had in Thailand. Yesterday he was confident that BJP will win and congress will be the main opposition. So he said, Congress will smash BJP-RSS. Now he realizes BJP did not win. So new story. I am not supporting  bjp-congress loot and kickback cartel that want to keep power between themselves through BS rhetorics.

<comment>Bad day for Bihar and India.  People keep electing this convicted crook Laloo year after year.  He will now add another 1000 crore rupees of loot to his fodder scam loot.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>No he surely told,but sometimes suggestions/coaching may not work in real exam as during exam one must have the ability to articulate what he or she has learnt.And surely at this juncture BJP or it's boss Amit shah failed to deliver --no doubt about it. I think for being BAHARI Amit Shah could not catch up the mind of Biharis with proper Slogan.Sometimes Electoral Politics is not about what kind of person you are,how much truth is in your accusations and arguments but it is all about articulation,communication,delivery process and arithmetic.It was a failure of Amit Shah or Modi in this election.You may solve a question in the exam from your assumption but that does not rule out the poor knowledge of yours regarding the particular question.</comment>

<comment>of course caste trumps everything..u make choices like lalu and u get governance like.then cry latter that we are underdeveloped  aa haa.. its like muslims producing 10 kids and not getting none of them well educated and then latter crying that we are lying at the bottom of the ladder..u got to ask urself who is responsible for tht situation..srry fr being just too straight forward</comment>

<comment>I cannot agree with your comment as BJP is ruling other states with substantial SC/ST/OBC voters' support.For Bihar,UP and Tamilnadu the story is different for any national party be it BJP or Congress as the regional players have become Jaigirdars/Zamindars/owners of that vote bank in those regions as those regional party's foundation is based on caste movement or caste identity.</comment>

<comment>Patels voters were supporter of BJP in Gujarat but now they r ready to defeat BJP because Modi says everywhere  I m OBC n patels does not like this kind of statement </comment>

<comment>That is separate issue as Patels are not OBCs.Patels did not  oppose Modi due to his OBC credentials but they themselves wanted to be counted in the OBC list.</comment>

<comment>If it could have become a Nitish Kumar show then people of Bihar could hope for security,peace and prosperity,but Laloo's success is horrible for Biharis.At the end of the day people deserve a leader as they have voted for.Let us wait and watch.Laloo has reinstated his 'parivar' discarding the 'sangha paribar'.</comment>

<comment>which award she got?</comment>

<comment>All opposition are Jaichand's Aulad</comment>

<comment>Nitish will have tough time pandering to Lalu's demands.He has to be constantly at hie feet,like Manmohan with Sonia</comment>

<comment>funny you should say this ....my friend from Bihar predicts a fall out from end of this week ....Lallo's two sons will be queing up for posts of finance ministry and ministry of deputy CM.....so that Laloo can remote control Bihar....I am sure the SC will pardon him ....</comment>

<comment>Bihar election result reflects only the false committment by BJP during LOK SABHA Election. No stopping of inflation, no improvement in infrastructure, no development for common man. Huge Rebate to Big Companies, like they are providing Job to 10% of our countrymen and heavy taxes for all. Still choosing Lalu & Company is not good but what people think is how current situation is. So in all Common People's fate in India is still in darkness. </comment>

<comment>I partly agree with you.But Kejriwal himself has become gradually associated with those groups,then how can he bring Susashan to country-men?</comment>

<comment>let modi clean up the mess in 5 years till ppl take it for granted.. then some dumbfkr will win and coast along for next 5 years on his work, then he will show what a pig he is in next 5, then the countrymen will hold their violated backsides and start screaming for BJP again</comment>

<comment>There's a way to AVOID that - we have to tabulate which people and geographies are more loyal, and which are more disloyal. Then we have to do a pullback - we pull back into the loyal areas and help them, and keep them independent from the bad disloyal areas and leave those disloyals to come up with their own solutions. We know our solutions will work - we know that we understand market economics while those others believe in crappy fantasies. The fact that others continue to be addicted to their crappy fantasies is their fault, not ours. They'll have to be left to become responsible for their own lives and their own fate. We can in the meantime focus on helping those who want to be helped, and to keep out the disloyalists so that they can't cheat by trying to raid the prosperity we can create. The disloyal have to be left to clean up their own lives, which they'll never be able to do with their crappy fantasy solutions. Meanwhile those loyal to realism can be helped, since they're at least willing to embrace reality instead of retreating back into darkness like Lalu Jungle Raj.</comment>

<comment>Like you are spam and spam is you</comment>

<comment>then we have to support him It is is not there that I do not differ with him or criticize him but always objectively. it is a toddler party and needs care. it is not for nothing that these bhakts lose sleep over his and AAP name.</comment>

<comment>Huggies baby buaaaah buaaah</comment>

<comment>He has proved a nightmare in short timeFor BJP but he also needs to hold his fort Delhi strong like other regional leaders I think he is missing on it </comment>

<comment>He must learn a lot from Laloo, not just chara business but also swiss accounts and other kinds of misery that could be unleashed on dilliwalas</comment>

<comment>yes shortcomings are there. no doubt about it. but first he is inexperienced in real politik. second, central govt. and the LG are acting as foes out to discredit and dismantle him. it is really difficult task and times for AAP.</comment>

<comment>When he gets people confidence no need to worry on LG and all Mamata was threatened by sharada scam but she has Bengal people behind her same Jaya was threatened by congress for many years butTN behind her </comment>

<comment>yes most of his support id intact. but this 67/3 was an artificial outburst by the voters against BJP and such vote share is difficult to be sustained by any party in the long run.</comment>

<comment>How many days it will take for fekuchand to again arrange some grand mela and start "Doston......" with jaw wide open, head tilting both sides to give camera view, hands stretched both sides, as if propagating 'Swasti', and ultimately getting solid smack by the very countrymen one after another.</comment>

<comment>12 tariq ko London ja rha hai wohan pe Mitroon karega</comment>

<comment>Some idiot Bhakts have been for quite sometime abusing, spitting filth, terrorising others by sheer personal abuse in Firstpost. If by God's grace, a little bit of sense prevails in their stupid brain, let them rectify themselves. Else the path of self-destruction has already been opened for them as well as their Lord.</comment>

<comment>--CHALLENGE FOR BOTH NITISH AND lALLO is to work in coherence with one another and help one another enhance their vision. And free india from colonial economics and consider indian way of // cashlesscooperatives . blogspot . in //</comment>

<comment>BJP started with gujarat model, then went down and down and down and finally settled at cow. LOL !!!</comment>

<comment>Fekuchand has so far not learn  that Mukhiya post has some dignity.</comment>

<comment>Bhakts are frustrated! Their Fekuchand has been loosing the (fake) credibility (that event managers have been desperately trying to project). They couldn't digest that Motu is actually a deadwood if  not a nuisance. They couldn't digest that their Lord would make their 'Party' such where from No 1 to No 50, there are onlyFeku and Motu and nobody else.</comment>

<comment>And this entire comment proves your frustration. Figured out aap got nothing from this election? </comment>

<comment>Need more burnol  BJP bhakth can you u win in TN Bengal </comment>

<comment>Why?  Cause aap got nothing?  Jumla iyer had antacids yet? </comment>

<comment>Thanks , a big thanks to Bihar people for anti-modi vote.</comment>

<comment>not for any anti vote but for helping save secular democracy.</comment>

<comment>Hi GB!</comment>

<comment>hello.</comment>

<comment>So Fekuchand got doosra Jhatka today!</comment>

<comment>are there celebrations at 'our' site?</comment>

<comment>but will the things change?</comment>

<comment>Jai laloo, btw I am still waiting in your brilliant analysis that you ran away from giving...</comment>

<comment>who ran away? are you dreaming?</comment>

<comment>So where is the analysis?  Did you dream that up as well? </comment>

<comment>which analysis? in any case no analysis will help you to gain wisdom. better remain chanting Namo Namo.</comment>

<comment>Ha ha! Look at the bhakt running away. Its ok. You are expected to be a bhagoda. The analysis you promised was how this election helps aap in pm elections in 2019...</comment>

<comment>Great election..exhilarating experience</comment>

<comment>ISIS bombing of Russian jet has only consolidated the great bear's decision to decimate the Arab World. </comment>

<comment>Ha ha!  Aaptards here are trying their level best to make this look good for ak and bihar. Zero on both counts. Bihar got laloo, ak got nitish...</comment>

<comment>More than the victory, its the defeat of politics of hatred..hope you get it..</comment>

<comment>And what did you get out of it?  Congrats for defeating er hate politics. You got yourself dark ages in return. Great job! </comment>

<comment>Not exactly, there is nothing to celebrate in this victory. But if BJP is serious about future elections, it needs to condemn the likes of Yoginath, Sadhvi and other hate mongers.</comment>

<comment>Future elections are TN and Bengal you condemn or no the results are zero </comment>

<comment>That they do. But what india lost out is momentum. What ppl forget in all this melee is that modi wants to pass important laws. This election was key only because of that...</comment>

<comment>you do not respect opposition consider them anti nationals and expect them to co-operate with you. PVNR ran a minority govt. and passed the most important bills for economic reforms. first learn to operate in a democracy and then think of any  thing else.</comment>

<comment>What bs! That happened in Upa 2 after all the scams got exposed. Are you now going to lie otherwise now? What happened to your promises in delhi?  Ak has become sheila all over again...</comment>

<comment>please remain on the topic. issue is that you do not have democratic thinking. so you do not know how to run a govt. please go to Vajpayi ji if nothing at least he knew how to take people along.</comment>

<comment>Really? if they did condemn long back, he wouldnt be talking sh!t on national TV as recent as last week. And some bhakts openly endorse his firebrand style of talking, while some other top leaders stay silent.</comment>

<comment>I said that is an issue. I never said it was right. That coupled with no congi arrests makes this a huge problem for bjp...</comment>

<comment>Exactly, which is what I said in my opening statement, that more than the victory, its a silent message from voters that such politics of hatred is unacceptable.As far as reforms are concerned, it will happen with time..People dont pay real attention to that I agree.</comment>

<comment>Why is Modi going around the world, meeting many powerful Head of States?To personally forewarn them about a major attack on Pakistan.End is near.</comment>

<comment>Bhakts should understand that all those who voted for BJP in 2014 shifted their base to others. Remember that in a democracy, you cannot isolate or disown any section of voters..</comment>

<comment>I am confused about who is real and duplicate.</comment>

<comment>please oblige him.</comment>

<comment>first ask your chhota karan to leave.</comment>

<comment>This Is my honest short analysis on BJP’s debacle in Bihar ==>>>The foundations of BJP’s loss in Bihar were already laid a year ago when Media had started to spread distorted version of the land bill and typecasted BJP as an antifarmer party. Bjp were unable to counter the torrent of lies being torpedoed against them and the constant bedamning of BJP as being antipoor has somehow ingrained in the minds of the financially weaker classes.>>Second most important reason was inability of BJP to convey to the common masses that central govt. should be judged only at the end of last year of their term and before that if anybody is evaluating their performance is absolutely unfair and politically motivated. But on the contrary Media had began to to give fail certificate to BJP from the first 50 days of its official reign.>>BJP missed the trick of extracting all the credit for any relative development in Bihar during their combined coalition with JDU but they did the reverse and gifted Nitish the opportunity to take the full credit of the perceived relative development in Bihar.>>Media is the biggest catalyst in opinion-making scheme of the things , those rural places which are devoid of TV sets also base their opinions on the hearsay from other voices which are an indirect transfer of messages from Tele. And the utter skimming of Bhagwat’s innocuous remark over ‘Reservations’ along with shameless false reportage on Haryana’s dalit case consolidated backward sections due to the fear invoked by Media and the Grand alliance. Added with incessant hyping up of ‘Rising Intolerance’ which compelled Muslims to vote in mega en masse design led to BJP’s demolition.>>The issue of rise in price of one singular item i.e The Dal prices also had a big impact as it provided fuel to the fire and this superficial and false reflection of the inflation scenario of the country was massively milked by Media and the MGB to influence female voters along with weaker sections in the populace.But BJP failed big time to counter and present the real ever improving health of the economy to the people.>>The strategy to declare NO FACE in Bihar also gave advantage to MGB coz Modi had limited space and time to give in Bihar and all his speeches and messages were easily countered by lies spoken in a small one room PC by Nitish kumar everytime whenever PM’s mega rallies were over. But due to PM’s executive constrictions it was not possible for him to answer and counter to each and every speech of Nitish,Therefore if they had a face than ‘he’ could have retorted Nitish on all the levels , as well as Media were ought to broadcast his every step and words spoken.This would had helped immensely in clearing the fogs of lies infused by MGB..This was part of my P.O.V , I sincerely hope BJP would get serious , active , ruthless , aggressive against Media and be one step ahead rather than reduced to defend the floods of lies plastered upon them on the daily basis....</comment>

<comment>Meanwhile there is a shortage of burnol today. Also advanced happy diwali to all.</comment>

<comment>This is arrogant ... Please return 30 seats BJP won in MP election. people are always smart... </comment>

<comment>BJP needs to openly come out and hold press conferences against the media itself....but choosing words and reasoning with some shrewd arguments to ensnare media in their own backyard.... They can use the excuse of 'SOME' media houses but never name them directly..If BJP doesnt take this bold step they're doomed..</comment>

<comment>Already doomed</comment>

<comment>Oh they apparently released a booklet against 'rising intolerance'. Lol. It looks like it did wonders for the last phase of the elections.</comment>

<comment>in time of your grief your language has become a bit cultured. so you need more of such shocks to get rid of your vulgarity.</comment>

<comment>Madarssa-chaddi....kindly save yourself from such open pillory..  LMAO</comment>

<comment>in your off time which Shakespearean dictionary you cram up without understanding it?</comment>

<comment>Nah !  nobody has time for it .... and this shoot and scoot cowardice wont serve you well...if you believe i didnt understood 'it' , explain exactly how ?? where did i misused any word ??</comment>

<comment>your this Shakespearean english has heterogeneous miscibility with the vulgarities and obscenities you specialize in.</comment>

<comment>See once again you proved how dimwit and irrational Madarssa-chaddis are ..!!Asked you just one simple question to establish misuse of any word and you folks as always failed..LMAO</comment>

<comment>i told you but your poor IQ (due to bhakti) does not let you understand any thing.</comment>

<comment>LMAO......  its so clear who has MADARSSA-IQ aka low IQ here.... you're a typical flapping-knees Madarssa-skunk , scooting off after making imaginary allegations... LMAOSo which word i misused ? are you so dumb that you cant answer this simple question...lol</comment>

<comment>Coward</comment>

<comment>where did I say you misused? what you write are incompatible with your vulgar thinking and vocabulary. otherwise you are a standard bhakt with all the traits.</comment>

<comment>Thing to watch out. How Lalu serves after 10 years of inexperience. In the end, he's the senior partner without CM. Interesting Bihar govt this time.</comment>

<comment>Nitish knew that if he will keep good relation ship with AK then AK supporter will help him through social media because after BJP only AAP'S supporters remains active in social media otherwise congress n JDU does not have support in social media</comment>
