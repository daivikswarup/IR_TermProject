<comment>As per the definition of patriotism constructed  by the Sanghis and stands as an edifice, now Jait (liar) is an anti-National to the core !!  LMAO !!</comment>

<comment>What if some Indians want to screww mother and Indians want to screww motherland?? Is this the reason why Indian men have difficulty in have girl friends and India does not want to get involved in wars outside India, and is deeply INWARD looking?Sigmund Freud father of psychoanalysis said "mother worship" when asked to define India. Continuing this analysis::Arnab Goswami goes slightly wrong when he says even left loves India. Love non-mediated by religion turns motherly love to love for female. That is why Left is intent of screwwing India. That love is sexual love for mother, motherland. Jats and Kapus in Andhra Pradesh[who have burnt a train] are demanding reservation. That is again immoral sexual love for motherland.Such effect of predatory sexual love for motherland [nothing wrong with motherly love]has even led to murder of motherland in history as following shows..Dahir was BRAHMIN King in Sindh. By enlisting the support of local tribes (such as the Jats, Meds and Bhuttos) and Buddhist rulers of Nerun, Bajhra, Kaka Kolak and Siwistan as infantry to his predominantly-mounted army, Muhammad bin Qasim defeated Dahir and captured his eastern territories for the Umayyad Caliphate.Dahir then tried to prevent Qasim from crossing the Indus River, moving his forces to its eastern banks. Eventually, however, Qasim crossed and defeated forces at Jitor led by Jaisiah (Dahir's son). Qasim fought Dahir at Raor (near modern Nawabshah) in 712, killing him; Dahir's wife immolated herself (with other women in her household) in accordance with the Hindu tradition of Jauhar.=========================================================Academicians have swallowed a fascist lie spread by media that India is a democracy.What a Joke! What about the assault on Individual right of merit by reservation policy? In which country are cities brought to a halt by bandhs? Media should first say India was a Ocholocracy[mob rule].India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] not a democracy. Free speech can be explosive unless it is a part of movement to uproot the Ocholocracy. In a Ocholocracy INDIVIDUAL rights are murdered by definition with help of state. Examples of murder of INDIVIDUAL right are reservation policy which is murder of merit, an INDIVIDUAL right and socialism(by definition legal robbery) which is murder property right, another INDIVIDUAL right.Why are Indians not trusted with free gun laws as in USA? Answer to this simple question demolishes free speech argument.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why were leftists associated with secessionists? The culture of socialist legal robbery is manifesting itself as secessionism - because the socialists may have realized it is impossible to come to an understanding on who the supreme dictator should be and they want to establish numerous single part dictatorships over fragments of country. Socialism has to lead to single party dictatorships over fragments of country.Adam Smith, the father of economics, says in economics Man Proposes and God Disposes. If every body in a nation become do-gooders -- God disposes -- and we will have hell on earth. if man proposes to be selfish -- God again disposes -- and we will have prosperity and peace.Giving rational explanation of God, the elder do-gooders , MK Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Ambedkar etc forgot that a strong socialist state is required to do good. And it will demand its pound of flesh closest to the heart – rampant corruption. A strong state emerges in an environment of shortages – to distribute scant resources. Any socialist state will NOT destroy the reason for its existence. 24 hour water supply will reduce water required to be released by 30%. No Government Engineer in India will accept this. Scarcity, distress is required for the reason for its existence. If no scarcity exists it will manufacture it. Mysore had water scarcity even though it had KRS dam beside it. It is a question of power. A society can either have equality or freedom but never both. Why? To enforce equality a strong and intrusive state is required. Stateism is against Individualism and kills freedom.Since 1947, the political parties, government need not care as they have attained emancipation from democracy -- principally by the tool of reservation policy, where vote banks are formed. And they will vote according to predictable patterns whatever the rulers do or don't do. In other words India has become a Fascist state[socialism is a necessary component of it --Nazi means National Socialist]by the vehicle of reservation policy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just voting does not make India democracy. Protection of rights of the smallest minority the INDIVIDUAL MAKES A SYSTEM DEMOCRATIC. The problem is, India is an Ocholocracy[mob rule] where Individual rights are murdered[example is murder of merit an Individual right by reservation policy and property rights by socialism. Socialism is legal robbery.A period of good dictatorship may be required to cure Indians of disease of bad democracy, due to the infection of socialism or legal robbery. Otherwise bad democracy can kill in millions like in Cambodia under Pol Pot. Ocholocracy looks like democracy but it is not. Just look at immorality of Indians- Laloo the reason for largest migration of Biharis from Bihar was reelected.-----------------------------------------------------------It is logically wrong to allow communist parties to function in a multi party democracy as they are for single party dictatorship - they openly state it! Ban communist parties===================================================Now BJP/RSS should bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=============================================</comment>

<comment>Now PM, FM and Home Minister will shed Croc tears till the Budget session ends...Big Nautanki Govt.....</comment>

<comment>Well, finally the Central fire fighting team has arrived on the scene and jumped into action when they realised that their own people will be burnt to death in the JNU fiasco and I see all Tom, Dick & Harry of the fire fighting team providing acceptable sound-bites, but it seams that the Captain of the fire fighting team will again miss the bus to create further chaos in the upcoming parliamentary session so that except for the budgets (even that is doubtful) nothing goes through. It is a shame, Captain(coward) being the leader of the fire fighting team should have been the first person to address this issue long back, which could have prevented lots of damage.</comment>

<comment>MODI..... DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING----------------Terrible fire broke out in Modi’s “Make in India” event……. It is now abut baking innocents people alive under BJP Government…. MODI is a bad omen for India. MODI takes misery wherever he goes…… If MODI continues to damage India like this, India and Indians will be doomed. When MODI was born in Sep 1950, there were terrible floods in country. When MODI married poor Jasodaben at age 18, her life was ruined forever. When MODI became Gujarat CM, terrible riots happend and thousands of innocent people were killed. When Atal Bihari Vajpayee opposed MODI’s CM ship, Vajpayee old man lost general elections of 2004 and his health suffered. When MODI supported Lal Krishna Advani in 2009, poor BJP lost elections nationwide. When MODI became India's PM, the Rupee was at 59 and now it is at 69, Indian stock market NIFTY was at 9K now it is under 7K. When MODI won the J&K assembly elections, terrible floods came to J&K. When MODI visited the US, America decided to sell fighter planes to Pakistan. When MODI visted Pakistan to meet Pakistan’s hero Dawood, Hafiz Sayed and LET attacked Pathankot with India’s pants down. When MODI visited Indian soldier Hanumanthappa, the brave Indian soldier sank deeper into coma and never recovered. When MODI visited ‘Make In India”, this terrible fire erupted….. MODI brings misery and mayhem where he goes…. MODI is a bad news for India..</comment>

<comment>Babur please save India 🙏🙏We are sorry earlier we thought Modi is great saviour !!😄😄😄😄😄</comment>

<comment>STOP FIGHTING…… You primitive Hindus have always been disorganized, backward of a self imploding culture.  It took me, Babur the Great, a failed knight from the Farghana district in Afghanistan to come and conquer your land just with 12,000 well disciplined and brave soldiers and defeat the large but darpok Indian army of 125,000 in 1526 in Panipat. I decided to bring some civility to this primitive land of immense superstitions, 330 million Gods like monkey Gods, snake Gods, girl teasing Gods and wife abusing Gods and show the light of wisdom under Islam under one God. As soon as I heard about your horrific Hindu tradition of SATI, I immediately banned with a furmaan in 1528. But you stupid Hindus did not stop burning your women alive.  It only took the British to ban it again in 1780.  One more thing…. MODI’s real name is Nairuddin Muddi and Jasodaben is Jasmilah. You all have the Mughul blood of my soldiers. Behave and play nicely. You all are cousins.</comment>
