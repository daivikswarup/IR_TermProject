<comment>Rahul Gandhi was caught by US police with his brazillian girlfriend in 2001 with 10 kgs of drugs and 10 million USD cash. Sonia begged Atalji to save her son and Atalji's large hearted ness or foolishness saved him. PM instructed the Indian embassy to get him released. The Vatican controlled paid indian media hushed up the whole incident. Else people of India would have known that Rahul with his gf is in US jail ! Also Atalji dug his own grave by saving Rahul baba else he could have thoroughly exposed congress and won a decisive second innings in office !``</comment>

<comment>Rahul Gandhi and the commies are dangerous to the country.  Supporting the anti national creatures in JNU is one of the nastiest things a politician can do.  And all this is done just becaiuse they oppose the BJP.  Is their hatred for the BJP so great that they would support the anti national creatutres?</comment>

<comment>Nehru Gandi Cingress,   Communists, AK 420 do not hate BJP.They hate people of Bharat who voted them out of power, and  stopped them looting the people.This anti national  group  came to power on back of Ignorant  Muslim vote.Their  strategy-Keep Muslims ignorant, uneducated, in poverty and as votebanks .Disrupt the nation and stop developmentIt worked before, why not again ?</comment>

<comment>The clown prince of the Congress is undoubtedly fishing in troubled university ponds, for political mileage, both at Hyderabad and at JNU. Having said that the fat man of the BJP should remember that his political ideologues are being accused of authoritarian intolerance and that his beloved Guru Golwalkar professed admiration for Hitler. </comment>

<comment>I will free the wife deserter Narendra Modi from the ignorant, multi-God worshiping, polytheist, and primitive religion and convert him to Islam under one God and give him a new name -- Nairuddin Muddi and Jasmilah for Jasodaben. He can have more wives if he wants but I know it is of no use due to the dhokla eating habit since childhood. It is a shame for a man. Nairuddin will shake hands with Oiwaisi and Azam Khan and they will celebrate the next Eid ul Fitr with a beef party where Smriti Irani will do a belly dance at the mujra all night. But remember‚Ä¶. Alcohol is prohibited in Islam.</comment>

<comment>Terrible fire broke out in Modi‚Äôs ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù event‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. MODI is a bad omen for India. MODI takes misery wherever he goes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ If MODI continues to damage India like this, India and Indians will be doomed. When MODI was born in Sep 1950, there were terrible floods in country. When MODI married poor Jasodaben at age 18, her life was ruined forever. When MODI became Gujarat CM, terrible riots happend and thousands of innocent people were killed. When Atal Bihari Vajpayee opposed MODI‚Äôs CM ship, Vajpayee old man lost general elections of 2004 and his health suffered. When MODI supported Lal Krishna Advani in 2009, poor BJP lost elections nationwide. When MODI became India's PM, the Rupee was at 59 and now it is at 69, Indian stock market NIFTY was at 9K now it is under 7K. When MODI won the J&K assembly elections, terrible floods came to J&K. When MODI visited the US, America decided to sell fighter planes to Pakistan. When MODI visted Pakistan to meet Pakistan‚Äôs hero Dawood, Hafiz Sayed and LET attacked Pathankot with India‚Äôs pants down. When MODI visited Indian soldier Hanumanthappa, the brave Indian soldier sank deeper into coma and never recovered. When MODI visited ‚ÄòMake In India‚Äù, this terrible fire erupted‚Ä¶.. MODI brings misery and mayhem where he comes‚Ä¶. MODI is bad news for India....</comment>

<comment>India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] not a democracy. Free speech can be explosive unless it is a part of movement to uproot the Ocholocracy. In a Ocholocracy INDIVIDUAL rights are murdered by definition with help of state. Examples of murder of INDIVIDUAL right are reservation policy which is murder of merit, an INDIVIDUAL right and socialism(by definition legal robbery) which is murder property right, another INDIVIDUAL right.Why are Indians not trusted with free gun laws as in USA? Answer to this simple question demolishes free speech argument.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why were leftists associated with secessionists? The culture of socialist legal robbery is manifesting itself as secessionism - because the socialists may have realized it is impossible to come to an understanding on who the supreme dictator should be and they want to establish numerous single part dictatorships over fragments of country.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just voting does not make India democracy. Protection of rights of the smallest minority the INDIVIDUAL MAKES A SYSTEM DEMOCRATIC. The problem is, India is an Ocholocracy[mob rule] where Individual rights are murdered[example is murder of merit an Individual right by reservation policy and property rights by socialism. Socialism is legal robbery.A period of good dictatorship may be required to cure Indians of disease of bad democracy, due to the infection of socialism or legal robbery. Otherwise bad democracy can kill in millions like in Cambodia under Pol Pot. Ocholocracy looks like democracy but it is not. Just look at immorality of Indians- Laloo the reason for largest migration of Biharis from Bihar was reelected.</comment>

<comment>Emergency trampled democratic rights and freedom of speech. Emergency for what purpose? They jailed all leaders, to retain power. They are not ashamed for supporting people who attacked Parliament, the city of Mumbai, Pathankot Air base. These vote bank vultures stoop to any level. Another weapon in their armor is unlimited irrational freebies which are mired with corruption during implementation.</comment>

<comment>When these bjpigs die !</comment>

<comment>These are well planned, sustained campaigns. The players are the communists,the congress (the Ma-Beta duo), and all those fringe elements that have been defeated in the last elections. They are being supported by the left wing press like NDTV. THE HINDU, SIFY.COM. Then there are journalists like Burqa Dutt, Rajdeep Sardesai and Karan Thapar, who have stashed billions of dollars in offshore accounts,The time is ripe to declare a state of emergency, suspend the constitution and throw these anti-national elements in jail for 20 years. Just throw them in jail and forget that they are there. The country can do without these "freedom fighters" .Is the country with the Prime Minister and his party? I hope so!</comment>

<comment>These evil monsters Rahul and his secular cronies are trying to bamboozle public by distorting facts of this protest ‚Äì Originally these students were holding an event in support of Afzal Guru and had all kinds of placards against the country and their sloganeering was of the same theme. These secular bozos are turning it around and projecting I as a ‚Äúsymbol‚Äù of freedom of speech ‚Äì my foot‚Ä¶.And this evil monster, Kim Jong Rahul and his cronies have the guts to support the protests to support Kanhaiya Kumar who led all this‚Ä¶.Congress perversion has no bounds and it is surprising people vote for them‚Ä¶. ‚Ä¶And I'm sure, if Kanhaiya was not arrested by the center, Congress would have "hanged" him and made him a martyr and Rahul Gandhi would have visited his parent in Bihar where they live....Oh, Rahul would have sat with students with CLV (Candle Light Vigil) also.</comment>
