<comment>shameless bjp still li ck ng her feet</comment>

<comment>(1) Late Shri Mufti Mohammad Sayeed had valid reasons forming an alliance government with BJP. After death of her father, Ms Mehbooba Mufti is reconsidering her political options and it is understandable why she feels uncomfortable with her party’s alliance with BJP. Her political calculations are perhaps based on her party’s future, as she sees it. (2) Political objectives of PDP include ‘azadi’ for people of Kashmir, whatever that means. But if by continuing its alliance with BJP, if Ms Mehbooba Mufti feels that she is losing her popular base, she may decide to part ways and make efforts to secure a majority on its own in the next Assembly Election. (3) Though PDP is the largest party in Jammu & Kashmir Assembly right now, it will not be easy for the party to secure a majority for any party. On the other hand BJP has nothing much to lose either way. Question is whether BJP can hope to benefit in the long run if PDP decides not to continue in alliance government with BJP? (4) PDP’s views on involvement of Pakistan for solution of Kashmir issue are definitely not similar to those of BJP. But question is this: Do the objectives of PDP clash with those of BJP? Ms Mehbooba Mufti will have to take a decision. Let us not forget here that political alliances are for sharing of power whenever an opportunity or need to do so arises. In such situations, ideologies do not matter; in fact they are conveniently ignored and alliances are formed.</comment>

<comment>She is ' whoring' with Cong as well as Bjp. Old habits die hard.</comment>

<comment>Sooner than later politicians in Kashmir will have to address the problem of jobs for Valley youngsters. I wonder how they will be able to do this, unless they allow Industries to come in.  And, if they want investments and Industries, how will potential investors come in with restrictive laws such as Art 370 which does not permit anyone other than Kashmiris to own real estate. This is a strange catch 22 situation, which the Kashmir politicians themselves have put on. What a pity, Kashmir in my opinion can aim at 100 Pct employment, especially if they aim to woo service Industries such as , IT, BPOs etc in addition to Tourism, if the politicians can come out of the shekels of the past. The Industries I have mentioned are non polluting and high employment generators.  Otherwise the state will remain eternally dependent on Tourism,Small business and ,perhaps Agriculture only. They will never be able to meet the aspirations of their youngsters, and, bring prosperity to Kashmir.</comment>

<comment>@Einstein Brain,perfectly put. By extension of the above theory PDP is pushing J& K towards Trifurcation into Jammu ,Leh  and Kashmir Valley.MM may not see it today but the inexorable logic is moving towards Trifurcation.</comment>

<comment>the said part every private company failed to make an effort to do some serious stuff in Kashmir. If people get jobs and some kind of political independence there is no doubt the wounds will heal. But the problem the stakes are to high for every actor and agency.</comment>

<comment>She is doing a lot of drama. The things is even today she is holding a meeting of her party leaders, all she wants is a call from Prime Ministers office,  I think the PM should call her and assure her of his financial and political support. That would be good both for BJP and PDP. Either wise BJP will lose in Jammu and PDP in kashmir that is for sure.</comment>

<comment>Dear mehboobiji, i would advise you to immediately severe ties with BJP because you must have seen that modi feku visited recently to meet prakash singh badal in the hospital where he is admitted, but as per your statement modi did not come to see late mukti sab when he was admitted in AIMS, which is around the corner of modi house, what a mockery of political ties with PDP.  modi should have visited late mufti sab as well but he did not do so because he was muslims, where prakash singg badal is hindu, this shows the communal mind set of our PMso better pull the rug from bjp and form the next govt with congress, NC and independents  which  will be a secular govt and will run for full  years.</comment>

<comment>Badal is a Hindu???After reading this brilliant truth, your madam fainted :D:D:D</comment>

<comment>It is a Muslim majority state and they want to keep out Hindus at any cost. So much for our brand of secularism.</comment>

<comment>Is this the same Mehabooba whose kidnap was stage managed and returned some years back ?</comment>

<comment>that was her sister,  to whom this father - sister duo got kidnapped so as to rule in kashmir</comment>

<comment>Late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was a great leader. The State witnessed good governance, peace and quiet and a reasonable level of development. People deserve similar leadership in future too. Good luck.</comment>

<comment>If she do not want to form the Government, let her go and there should be elections in the state again looking for fresh mandate.</comment>

<comment>Let's get fact straight - 80,000 crore package was NOT for rehabilitation as stated.  It was for development over six years!  8,000 crore in the first year is not unreasonable, considering development projects take time as costs come towards the end.  Fact is that PDP now does not get opportunity to siphon funds towards its own friends and family, is the real issue and source of dissatisfaction </comment>

<comment>absolutely correct. so far all kashmir parties have been siphoning of funds sent by centre for development.</comment>

<comment>Mehbooba's  dirty games will only ruin her and her party.</comment>

<comment>It is heartening to see Mehbooba giving sleepness nights and jitters  to the BJPee leadership unlike her shameless unprincipled and unscrupulous father who did the unthinkable aligning with a party whose position on Kashmir is antithesis to what his party stands for and thus exemplifying himalayan heights of opportunism in a bonding which raised many eyebrows as to how low one can stoop to conquer   !!</comment>

<comment>@Rationalist, you are simply taking the State towards Trifurcation,Good Luck.</comment>

<comment>There is no point praising this pro pakistani pdp party. Pdp is not going to gain by delaying or pulling the plug from alliance. Including congress, all the parties who ruled jnk did only to promote the unrest so that they could enjoy the powers and loot public at the expense of national security. These parties turned out to be worse than mafia gangs, cartels, alqaedas etc.</comment>

<comment>So, the shameless BJP aligned with a pro Pakistani and Seperatist PDP party in its lascivious lust for power !!</comment>

<comment>It is so shameless that ppl vote for terror supporters..a nationalist  alliance  is rite medicine  for ppl and PDP.</comment>

<comment>Prezzie rule to continue for the good of the country n state. This lady with separatist ideology shudnt be given power</comment>

<comment>All noise is bull shit...PDP is crumbling as it does not want a woman to lead..it is salfi party not a sufi party.</comment>

<comment>This is the price you pay when you sleep with the enemy to gain power. Modi's stupidest move was considered to be a strategy. Its time for hard stand. Its time for Kashmiri Pandits to move back to Kashmir. Elections alone can not bring majority government in Kashmir. Unless defense is given autonomous authority in Kashmir, this problem cannot be solved. Atleast not by a clown with travelers bone within himself.</comment>

<comment>Are smoking pot?  One cannot take hard stand on soft ground.  In a democracy majority rules, and BJP will never have majority in JK without getting Valley on its side.   Simple as that.</comment>

<comment>If talking about majority without coalition in J&K is smoking pot, then Modi probably had the full weed on before J&K elections when he gave the all to nothing speech.</comment>

<comment>And your point is?</comment>

<comment>Mehbooba is an Islamist and is in their clutches who cannot countenance a woman ruler, as it sets a precedence to their peril.</comment>

<comment>You sound like Shiv Sena.  Mehbooba is ELECTED by the people.  India is not TAliban!</comment>

<comment>It is time for India to pull the rug, and display some spine:1. Carve out Jammu as a separate state, and Ladakh as a Union Territory. This salvages 88 % of the land area and it can be fully integrated with India. All efforts should be made to develop these two parts.2. Stop providing any funding or support to Kashmir. Impose Army rule, black out the media and deal with the stone-pelters in the language they understand. Push them over across the border into their madre-watan, chased by dogs and bullets. This will also help in dealing with Paki induced terrorism.3. Stalwarts of the award wapsi/intolerance gang who are finding India unlivable should be sent to settle in Kashmir - their properties in India should be confiscated.4. Traitors like Yasir Mian should not be allowed to pollute any online or offline media in India. However, they would be welcome to go and settle in Kashmir valley.</comment>

<comment>@Harsh, your Point no. 1 alone shall solve this 68 year old problem.These 5-6 million in the Valley are holding a Country of 1250 million people to ransome,Its time to call their Bluff and settle the matter.</comment>

<comment>but the problem is the numbers itself...5-6 milliom!!...its almost impossible to control and put them under thumb,.in a democratic country like india......only one country could do that and that was china!!..proved really effective for them.</comment>

<comment>Really this is a demand of the day .It is a very good suggestion and it is the only solution.</comment>

<comment>It will be really Harsh.</comment>

<comment>Rather than stopping funding to the Kashmiris, I'd rather have them work as serfs for those from Jammu. The more their economy becomes dependent on Jammu and India, it less likely that their stomachs will vote for Pakistan even if their hearts and minds say so. Another step would be to make Pakistan a worse place than Kashmir so that even PoK asks for a vote to join India. The main place to attack should be Pakistani Punjab.</comment>

<comment>Pakistani Punjab is the exporter of 50% IT (international terrorism). Before ISIS came into existence, that figure was 100% . Now poor Pakistanis have lost their IT market share to ISIS. Bad times.</comment>

<comment>We could help them diversify the market and thus focus on domestic operations.</comment>

<comment>True..since Saudi has stopped giving FDI to Pakistani IT, they must focus on domestic operations. In fact they are doing well on that front. </comment>

<comment>Lower oil prices means more hard working people in pakistan as their current occupations dont get funding..it will be  even better if opium also comes down..and becomes legal.</comment>

<comment>saw the name "SAMIR YASIR" and chose not to even read his article..he is just an anti-national p u n k...........sh!ts where he eats.</comment>

<comment>That is how a person keeps becoming more ignorant.</comment>

<comment>yeah just read after seeing ur comment....thought may be he makes sense this time..but was dissapointed..he is basically asking not to take action agaisnt seperaist!!!..don jail them..do nothing...."do nothing" is never an option...the moment masrat alam was released..there was a riot there....i dont think terrorists should be handeled with kid gloves...that has never ever helped...yes would be terrorists can be counselled and given a chance once....he just puked shit here as well.i dont agree with him....if we had done nothign in 90's ..we would have already lost kashmir!!...</comment>

<comment>The short point is to make oneself knowledgeable and wise - one must read all opinions and views (however unpalatable they may be), then form your own opinion. If you are forming opinions, without reading the content, so be it - it is your problem.</comment>

<comment>kitno ka opinion sunega?..koi pagal ka opinion "baar baar " sunne ka kya zaroorat he?...there is no need to hear opinions of terrorists and mad men....becoz if you hear them continuosly you become one of them......point me aate hain na...prove me wrong...kya likha he yahan??...treat separatist nd terrosists with kids glove!!!...do nothing!...dont jail them!!!...this thing never ever helps....but i think you support this view...dekha uska opinion padh padh ke..tu bhi anti-national hogaya...wahi to prblm he.</comment>
