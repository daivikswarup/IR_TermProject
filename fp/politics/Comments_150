<comment>To add to these the recent Herald ruling has shamed the Congress and their counsel the NO LOSS protagonist, Kapilji. Kapil has been losing his face in couple of earlier cases, one in UP and another related to Sarda scam. I think Kapil is a scam specialist, since most of his assignments are related to Scams. As a minister in UPA, he was an utter failure with all his so called achievements going up into the AAKASH ( This scam needs to be investigated). Further Rahul's Suit-Boot has been reduced to Short & vest. Very soon it could turn into a Langoti. God save the Congress.</comment>

<comment>The issue of accepting PILs for hearing need to be examined to rule out sponsorship from vested interests. Nowadays we see more PILs being sponsored indirectly where the business or political interests are affected. One example is the PIL against Aadhar. It is obviously sponsored by the people interested and using multiple identity and impersonation with criminal intent. There need to put in place a mechanism to push this bias out of the PIL sphere.</comment>

<comment>Another TOI report says that there is clear evidence with the govt (file notings from that time) that sibal single handedly appointed a single  judge (Shivraj patil ) comittee to give report ( in exactly 1 month, extremely efficient committe i must say :)) that was used by CBI to frame an upright babu Mr Ghosh and along with him Pramod mahajan... and the Zero loss cheapster is now lying with impunity !!</comment>

<comment>today in an interview to Pagalika ghose in TOI... Tasleema Nasreen says that the "seculars" in India are the most anti hindu people, they have extreme double standards... all these  writer creeps ( my addition :)) did not lift a finger to support her when she was being hounded.. two of these "emminent" writers from WB who are now screaming for the FOE, even petitioned to buddhadep Govt to ban her book ... irony people??? no intolerance or attack on fundamental rights then???Though she agreed intolerance is increasing she said .. minorities are the most pampered lot in India... had they really been persecuted.. there are two neigbouring countries where they could have easily migrated to escape perscution !!I know, I know... Nasreen is a closet bhakt now ;))</comment>

<comment>why dont the so called intellect and secular ch**iyas return their awards as a mark of protest now.....and strangely the secular dogs dont even bark much on Jaggis page......</comment>

<comment>and mauveblues are seeing only black or white!eh?</comment>

<comment>Congis are well known for such trickery.</comment>

<comment>True. Jagannathan is true. Judiciary, at the lower and higher levels are true. That is why Amit Shah has been absolved. All police officers in encounter cases are out on bail. Kodnanai is out on bail. Something bonafide for ghosh and promod mahajan must be also bonafide for RAja, UPA and the then secretaries. Sanjiv Bhatt is dirty because he stood up to the mass murderer. What is wrong in being political. Police officers, retired army generals, bureaucrats incl. home secretary join bjpafte retirement. Were they all serving their political masters while they were serving. The whole question is the evidence. Who else can be worslt criminals than Modi himself and Amit shah who ruled over a regime of stealth, conspiracy, and killing, and extortion. The patels are slowly exposing the farce that was in display. Dattu will become a governor after he retires. Who can take on Bharathi and Vodofone. saini would have been rewarded substantially. What a farce.</comment>

<comment>poor scamgressi</comment>

<comment>Not sound. Questionable, political arguments.</comment>

<comment>Zee news article does not bother me at all, nor  the decsions of these courts. I have read the article carefully and doubt whether the courts decisions are based on facts or the manipulating skills of MOdi the Deceitful (I am fully convinced in my heart that he is a characterless man and will stoop down to any depth of degradation without any pangs of Conscience and also that he has abilities and sources and resources to turn things around in his favor). About Judges. Indian Judges of any court, many of them, are marketable and play in the hands of politicians. One Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and one of a Southern State High Court were habitual bribe-takers and perverts in justice. It might be the case even in these cases. I do not trust the Present Chief Justice, he is too close to Modi and BJP. Watch the Language used in Ghosh's case, The case is cooked up for extraneous reasons. It is not the judicial language, it is rather a sarcasm which judges don't use. In the second case of caskets, I feel  it was filed repeatedly as there was some new compelling evidence surfaced. The undue haste used by the courts to dispose it off and the timing of it, cast doubts on the integrity of the courts. In the third case, I feel Bhat was credible and the language of the court Bhat playing in the hands of Congress was a clear insinuation as it carried no  evidence at all.Bhat's word was as good as gold The language in Judgments sounds more like partisan than Judicial and haste and timing of release confirm my doubts. So I have no reservations  to call them tainted and manipulated. There is no need for the Congress to be embarrassed. They just have to keep a sharp focus on the Campaign to defeat the Crafty.</comment>

<comment>Mr Jaganathan. Surprisingly did not find the coffin case covered on FP. Can we get an update even though it is a few days old. Also can your team do some investigation and indicate the name of news anchor, the NGO and the Narmada Andholan rep who played a part in the Sanjiv Bhat case. I am sure all these must be in the court proceedings and hence cannot be a secret. As Mr Goswami would like to say, The Nation Wants To Know.</comment>

<comment>I too want to read the judgement on george fernades. i am an ardent admirer of fernades.</comment>

<comment>Jaggi and Bhakts, listen - Sanjeev Bhatt, Teesta and CBI are old stories. Congress has moved on. They have deployed journalists to write negatively in world media like NYT, Washyington Post, LA Times, Tribune. They have got some unknown mediocre artists to return their awards. They are killing people strategically and shouting as if Modi did it. It's an unfinished game, don't be complacent.</comment>

<comment>Congress can do whatever conspiracies & play games, Bhakts don't care or worry. The Con parties days are numbered.</comment>

<comment>Salman Rush-die deserves another fatwa.</comment>

<comment>Congress suffers from Modi phobia.Actually both Sonia and Rahul does not have any deep understanding of Indian polity hence they have made Modi as their only political tool for the last 13 years.Modi could never have risen as much as he has, had Congress not made their single point agenda to abuse him for every thing during UPA rule.Even after NDA came to power and Modi became PM Congress has single point agenda to  make him responsible even if some one is pissing at a wrong place.They forget that Indian is a federal democracy with a Government at centre and many governments in states.They also forget very conveniently that Constitution of India has demarcated Law and Order as state subject.Any thing happening any where in India is solely and solely  Modi's responsibility as all the state governments in their view are Modi's minions and cohorts and do not have powers to control wrong doings in the respective states..The more they abuse Modi ,the more he grows in stature in public view as Congress has lost it's sheen among the people of India due to poor leaderships of Sonia and Rahul.</comment>

<comment>You are right in stating that Rahul and Sonia Gandhi are afraid of Narendra Modi.  Rahul and and Sonia did not expect to loose the elctions by such huge margins.</comment>

<comment>"Yes" modi wave is still growing in areas where people don't even care about national politics</comment>

<comment>this is a great article. kapil sibal needs to be tried in court for deliberately foisting false charges for political purpose. he has wasted nation's valuable time in a big way. the guilty media men involved must too see their day in court. they all belong in tihar. clearly congressis with their corrupt ways, obsessed with the sense that they own india and that  india is their to plunder, have set india back by several decades. the gandhis belong in jail.</comment>

<comment>We have make hands of MODI strong. Hope BIHAR vote for BJP. One two irresponsible statements by some leaders shouldn't be a excuse to tarnish central goverement image. MODI government is doing good job in defense ,external affairs , infrastructure and economic situation is improving. The MAKE IN INDIA is a good thing to create manufacturing base , we can't depend on rains and agriculture all the time. Some people will try to disturb this government including from BJP but we have to keep faith in MODI and give him more time to perform.  MODI government is taking very bold steps in DEFENCE sector by encouraging private players to take some load of DRDO and have some competition.Asking AIRFORCE to take LCA tejas in high numbers is an example of this. This way indegenious industry will rise as we can't forever depend in foreign tanks and warplanes.</comment>

<comment>The Congress being a party of Nehru is expected to be immoral, incompetent and corrupt, so what the Congress does is hardly shocking . What is deeply disturbing is that India which is the worlds largest democracy does not have an honest and free media.</comment>

<comment>Latest by Congress is asking retired (and frankly, unknown) writers to give back their awards in protest of atmosphere of "intolerance".</comment>

<comment>Good to see the schemes of UPA getting exposed one by one. If Bihar delivers a strong political verdict, we can be rest assured of progress at a much faster pace.</comment>

<comment>Truth can never be hidden forever and lies can never live forever. Hail NaMo and BJP!</comment>

<comment>Congress crooked  chamachas have no shame  whatsoever to dance to the tunes of the dirty dynasty for a few crumbs!  BJP  must teach  Congress a bitter lesson in its own coin!</comment>

<comment>Oh,NDTV or India today, no special program  on this decision ? Still loyal to the soon to be extinct party ?</comment>

<comment>media is in the  hip pockets of congress party and ready to roll on the feet of Sonia Gandhi recently we saw Rajdeep serdasi doing it</comment>

<comment>Yes! This is more shameful for the congress.  It has tried everything including creating bitterness for Modi abroad! None of the MSM highlighted all these three judgements and corner Congress.  NDTV went one step ahead and had a programme whether Modi government is using law! Barkha Dutt should be made to remember that Bhatt judgement which she was moderating, the judgement ws delivered by Supreme Court.  We have lawyers like Indira Singh who said the judgement is wrong! the Judgement even criticised the role of the media and in particular one media person who is a top anchor.  The judgement has given enough material for the government of India to take legal action on Bhatt as well as the anchor. Its time Government exerts its authority on such brazen and acts of wilful malice and show the concerned people however powerful they may be their place! Today fools in AAP were tweeting that Modi's brazenness was called by SC. Little do they realize that the law was passed unanimously in Parliament and 20 states had ratified it.  This is how media twists and peddles lies.  A good article from Jaggu and an apt one at the right time.</comment>

<comment>Well said jaggu..the congress indeed has a lot to answer for..and they will..it will be at least one hundred years before anyone would ever trust these fake gandhis and the sick syco's ever again..Congress Mukt bharat is well on its way to becoming a reality..and as for the leftist sickular media, as you said, they can lump it or..</comment>

<comment>The Congress party suppressed truth through their socialist and communist allies.</comment>

<comment>in Pakistan is it !!!! they really deserve such shit party like congress</comment>

<comment>So many of the BJP"s "biggest corruption scams" are in fact completely false? Precisely what I alluded to in a comment on your article a few days ago. The left and the CONgis are a bunch of lying a**holes, that fling accusations with absolutely no evidence. Watch now, they wont have the dignity to apologize or say they got it wrong. They will continue pretending that everything they said is real. So next time you hear about Vyapam, or Lalitgate ....just tell these fools to prove it or shut up.</comment>

<comment>I am more convinced then ever before that all ills of India originated from failed family run fake gandhi party govts. The CONgi anti-nationals must be paraded naked on streets and shot dead.</comment>

<comment>Good news. Day after day congress and upa allies are losing all their sting and credibility. eagerly awaiting subhash bose's files in Jan. seems congress mukt bharat is coming too soon.</comment>

<comment>UPA rule is proven rule to thugs!</comment>

<comment>Modi Toadi Jaggu has stooped even lower than niticentral in licking Modi's boots. The flawed SC judgement on Sanjiv Bhat where the proof of connivance of the prosecutors with the accused is being ignored, but the means by which the proof was collected is being questioned. This same Jaggu praised Assange who leaked American's wrongdoing, the proof of which was gotten by theft. But RSS/BJP Chaddis are so hypocritical that they think that hypocrisy is a virtue.</comment>

<comment>poor guy ja khujalival ki chaddi ja kar baith ja</comment>

<comment>You must be starving and must be missing UPA rule or you must be from terror exporting house called Pakistan.</comment>

<comment>Yes, your information & analysis is more accurate than those in Judiciary !</comment>

<comment>My main argument is either all are communal or none is communal.Look at constitution itself..India is a Ocholocracy [rule by the mob, example reservation policy; casteism is also communalism and of a worse kind as stable vote banks are formed - which has led to emancipation from democracy of political parties and state] led by the mafia[till recently we had a genuine Italian one]. IT IS A SHAME TO CALL INDIA A DEMOCRACY.Pseudo-seculars brainwash that1)Opposite of communal is secular.2)From Point 1, Logically then opposite of Individual must be religious - anabsurdity. Hence statement 1 is absurd.3)The correct antonym is Opposite of communal is INDIVIDUAL and opposite ofsecular is religious. Individualism comes only with CAPITALISM -positivespinoff of selfishness and profit.4)Therefore by almost Iron logic of Euclid either ALL are communal or ALL arenot communal. It depends on how much India is capitalist[free economy].5)The fundamental RED communalism is therefore division between Bourgeoisie andproletariat - impeding growth of capitalism and Individualism.Reservation policy and socialism is the reason why if I were the president ofIndia, as owner of public sector banks, PSU would HANG MYSELF in abject shame.</comment>

<comment>The sun has risen in the west  in the FP world</comment>

<comment>hahaha.. very true!</comment>

<comment>well then going by their proven track record can we extrapolate into say - nehru condemned Netaji to gulag and was monitoring his family's mails . I am wondering why the left front of which Forward Bloc founded by Netaji a part hardly raised a murmur despite being 40 odd years in power in Bengal , any guesses !</comment>

<comment>Enjoying the perks of power in present is much more important than grieving over a now useless person.   It happens with most politicians in India.  They just take the names to garner votes.</comment>

<comment>but we are talking about the DNA , what you sow , so u beget , Nehru;s family will be like him , if they are doing this foisting cases in india against someone who could be their rival now , they would have learnt it from their family patriarch( now no more ), as he had done it against netaji</comment>

<comment>Nehru did it as per the pact (transfer of power) with British.  The pact did not allow any INA members to get any govt job.There are always a black sheep or two  in the family  who betrays.  Vibhisana, brother of Ravana could be a perfect example.  Same with Forward Block guys, I would guess.  Please note that I am not fully aware of FB's role in politics.</comment>

<comment>a black sheep here or there is ok , can the whole party be a black sheep and keep quiet about it, after all they were in power ( as part of left front ) and knew about it . transfer of power - well Britishers are telling indian govt elected by people of India that  we ( indians ) cannot employ fellow Indians because they fought against the british . well that's  the height of absurdity  , the pact itself shows a direct bias against netaji and is more or less confirming my earlier statement , nehru signed the pact so that netaji or INA are never employed by government of India , was he not power hungry - a question which I hope opens the pandora's box of lies of congress</comment>

<comment>I share your hope too.  Let the TRUTH emerge.  And let the traders of Lies get buried quickly & quietly.</comment>

<comment>Least said the better about these judgements. BJP along with controlling media is controlling judiciary via certain elements. Read Mr. Justice(Ex) Katju's article on one of the judges.</comment>

<comment>compare apple to apple don't try to take BJP's name every crime your party do and on Katju ..we all know what that man is all about </comment>

<comment>AND IT IS STILL WORKING.  SHAMELESS MEDIA AND SO CALLED AWARD WINNERS WHO ARE SENDING AWARDS BACK TO GOVERNMENT ON A LAME EXECUSE (THOUGH I NEVER FEVER LYNCHING INCIDENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS NOT SO  BIG ISSUE WHERE SUCH ACTION IN SUCH A NUMBER IS REQUIRED) THESE VERY PEOPLE NEVER TOOK THE SAME ACTION WHEN EMERGENCY WAS IMPOSED.  THEY NEVER DID SO AT THE TIME OF 1984 RIOTS. THEY ALSO EXCUSED THE UPA GOVERNMENT FOR BHAGALPUR RIOTS AND SO MANY SCAMS. NOONE BOTHERED FOR CWG SCAM 2G SCAM COAL SCAM AND LYNCHING OF ONE PERSON BY FEW DISGRUNTLED PERSONS HAS BECOME A VERY BIG ISSUE WHERE HEAVENS ARE GOING TO FALL.  THEY ARE SO BIG IN AGE SHARAM  BHI NAHIEN AATI</comment>

<comment>Have the award winners who returned their awards also returned the money with interest? Million dollar question</comment>

<comment>shameless congis will not understand the huge slaps on its face(gandhis).whole country knows the story and sympathies with namo. no surprise media is not entertained by namo  or by rest of india because of its playing the doggy to congress biscuits.indians are no more suckers to visual media</comment>

<comment>The game plan of Congress is in open.  They are trying to put brave face in their wrong doings and betrayal of people of india and also wrong propaganda. All the barkers in the Paid Electronic media need to answer to the citizens about how they blamed without knowing the facts.</comment>

<comment>The Indian media, the so called "intellectuals", the "writers" returning their awards, "the leftists, the congress and it's cronies all were looting and enjoying life till BJP came to power. Now that their way of life was given a stiff kick in their dirty back sides by the common men of India, they are still suffering the hangovers of their days of pilfer, loot and hence have become shrill and are making wild and baseless charges.The public knows the truth and will drive the last nail in the coffin of all these worthies.</comment>

<comment>It is the last para above that is the most telling. Congress hypocrisy is hardly surprising. But the media too played ball with the Congress all the time, committing foul after foul, in the pathetic attempt to smear and tar Modi and the NDA, for 'presuming' to  think that their overwhelming win in the 2014 elections was a 'mandate' from the people and denying the dynasty its divinely ordained right to rule India perpetually.</comment>

<comment>Jaggubhai - there is a lesson or two for several journos here - but I bet they will learn their lessons!  Unlike politicians who generally take sides purely for politics (unlike Congress which has always been witch-hunting on its opposition), journalists need to keep up unbiased and professional journalistic ethics - but they seem to be seldom doing so. :-(</comment>

<comment>What else can be expected from Mafia Raj of 10 years.</comment>

<comment>BJP communal hai aur congress corrupt hai...time time ki baat hai...when public gets tired with roits they elect congress... When they get tired with corruption they elect BJP....ek boot hai dusra jin...kuch bhi karlo...rehna inke saath Hi hai</comment>

<comment>Can u plz go and check the number of riots under the congress regimen and compare it to bjp regimen? Why is there no single riot in gujarat in last 15 years? why is there no major communal riots in the whole country after modi came to power?</comment>

<comment>lol u missed out an important part , congress was defeated only twice since independence ( look at the country now -) effectively for 6 years of 60 congress was not ruling and other time it was ruling with jokers as in charge ( 3rd front ) . of the 61 years  ruled by congress- their greatest achievement was not providing clean toilets to 60% of the population</comment>

<comment>How many riots by BJP, authentically not one. Many riots under Congress nose and rule beginning from 1947. Sikhs massacre was clearly handwork of Congress goons though media keeps mum about it.</comment>

<comment>Can you explain what is communal? why dont you think of commonalism? I think all those who bark about communalism, forgot english is a beggers language and the alphabet is O not U in the word.</comment>

<comment>All the Writers too are being paid by congress to make big issue of intolerance !!!!</comment>

<comment>There are much more sinister people / groups  who are ready to pay & paying.  Some people in Congress (Not all) are just the channels to do that favor (money, award, visibility, heading an institute, getting in some commission etc.).</comment>

<comment>Hope, the Government takes serious note of such things. Time has come to really take to task the vested interest behind the so called media faces of India. Who is sponsoring this daily routine of preaching from the perch from Durka Butt, Jardeep and other assorted members of this tribe - Why do they want to create a negative spin to every thing these days - How can the I&B department ensure balanced reporting</comment>

<comment>All the congress trolls are scared to comment in article , congress has slapped thrice by SC !!!!</comment>

<comment>one by one congress sleeper cells getting busted</comment>

<comment>No FIR has been filed against those arrested by UP govt post DADRI but this incident has been projected as most atrocious and International News by likes of Rajdeep and others cohorts of Congress. Factually they wanted to trigger another Godhra like situation by projecting this incident and create social tension and blame MODI. Anupm Kher the other slapped Rajdeep on TV show openly saying to him that He does not like Modi. If this  is the character of Media ( Left-intellectuals) how can we expect any common good of the country.</comment>

<comment>" That the Lutyens media too was willing to play ball with the Congress to repeatedly waylay Modi is a sad commentary on how the politician-media nexus works in Delhi."   -  That is a very good summing up.That our intellectuals sided with  political powers - that is the saddest part.</comment>

<comment>They are not intellectuals. They are stooges, sycophants, retainers, cronies and bootlickers.</comment>

<comment>Yes & No.Complete agree to this - " They are stooges, sycophants, retainers, cronies and bootlickers."But these people do have the intellect, though corrupted with virus etc.,   -  but but they do have the capability.  Alas, they use it for wrong purpose.  They use it like a Butcher where they could have acted like a Surgeon.</comment>

<comment>Their intellect is intellect of the crooks. Do you know that all crooks have been intelligent people.</comment>

<comment>Yes,  it is like the razor sharp knives.Even to do corruption (not the petty ones), one needs very sharp brain along with knowledge of working of the system & loopholes.Please do understand that I generally respect  the capability of a person on irrespective of whatever side he/she is.  I may not appreciate the actions though.  And I understand that I am a loner one on this point.</comment>

<comment>It is not bad to be a loner so long as you are true to your conscience.What to do you think of Kejriwal? Is he a crook too who has manipulated the system to his advantage?</comment>

<comment>Please stop calling such anti-nationalists as 'intellectuals' or liberals. Closet politicians, PR agents or non-electable neta is the more apt term to describe such people. They don't even deserve to be called journalists.</comment>

<comment>Rakesh,I agree with you. However, the problem is with us too...Why are we tolerating such traitors? Have we become so gutless that we silently watch these traitors r@ping us and our country on daily basis? Why don't we deliver instant justice to them?</comment>

<comment>You say Rajdeep and others are intolerant and they say  India has become an intolerant country. They are able to give instant justice through TV channels watched world wide.Our tolerance and credibility is determined by in your words by traitors How to explain this situation to the world? This is a grave situation every Indian is facing because of these traitors.</comment>

<comment>If India has become intolerant country , how is that these anti-establishment anchors (former pro establishment anchors) are allowed to freely air their views ? can they answer?</comment>

<comment>Writers and media are are guilty of double standards.Thanks to Taslima.See today's ToI.Those who are in social media are well educated,knowledgeable and who are capable of matching with these writers,journalists and intellectuals received awards.To the extent they have the say in the matter we also have the equal say to counter them. Some writers are belonging to political parties like CPI No body should question them.Those who opposed them were violently handled and such brutal actions were justified in public and none questioned them..There is political angle to return of awards.State Governments have to handle the situation in a matured way without taking sides.</comment>

<comment>I think left leaning writers should be packed off to Cuba to see for themselves  how their theories are working there. I guarantee, they will come back by the next return fight.</comment>

<comment>I have stopped watching their shows / channels. That is the best punishment I feel.</comment>

<comment>Yes, Yes ... we know ! But we won't give up, we have many more aces lined up:- we will unleash 'award returning' writers- intellectuals will decry the 'shrinking space for public discourse' and 'death of the idea of India'- we have our people in all walks of life, be it a Justice Shivraj Patil or a Sanjiv Bhatt or a Teesta Setalvad. We will activate them all ... One by one.- we will block parliament- we will try to vitiate the atmosphere by instigating communal and casteist hatred. Don't forget, the entire media is with us !- we will activate our friendly NGO's- Finally if nothing works, our G family will fly out of India. But they will continue to sponsor us with the trillions they have at their disposal !So don't worry Chums, such explosions in our face will not deter us !</comment>

<comment>You are unlocking Sangeet Som, Sadhavi Prachi, Yogi and likes to spread hate or what</comment>

<comment>And thats why , we are not campaigning in Bihar, we don't need any MLAs in Bihar.Ha ha ha</comment>

<comment>And please also add 2 more. - Its the handiwork of RSS - Modi jawab do</comment>

<comment>Malaysian Airliner MH 370 was shot down in Ukraine by a Russian made  missile. MOdi jawab do.</comment>

<comment>this is the best thread i have seen. yes, keep connecting the sickular dots, right here in one common place, and publish it.  this would be a big public service. harsh, you are wonderful. victor and mythbuster are perceptive. with folks like these coming together and helping the indian people get a good perspective, we know india is going distance.  no exaggeration there. thanks.</comment>

<comment>Congress is party if the frauds, their leadership of bar waitress and her mentally retarded son, land grabber son in law is proof for their gutter quality & standards. No matter what they do they cannot just throw muck at BJP or Modi.</comment>

<comment>Many more IAS and IPS are on Congress payroll, Sanjiv Bhat is just one of the. That is why Modi reforms and efforts are clearly being sabotaged by bureaucrats making his task really difficult.</comment>

<comment>but he is too shrewd a man to be cowed down by these silly tricks by pappu the retard and his party..the VRS scheme that he has announced is clearly for cleansing those souls from the system...</comment>

<comment>This is nothing but like throwing shit on Congress's face. Icing on the cake comes on nov 8th when the Bihar election results are declared....</comment>

<comment>media bstrds and the so called decayed "intellectuals" have nothing to say or discuss on these..crook bhatt's case has exposed how scared the wicked mother-son duo was on Modi</comment>

<comment>Great congee's being slapped left and right... though lutyens media folks are totally ignoring the judgements ......,And sardesai is feeling impotent rage. ..All this is coming out and he can't do much for his masters  except rant about "rising intolerance" daily ....sigh</comment>

<comment>i lay the blame on the part that remained silent or did not make enuf noise sec 66A around. Thanks to SM we now know the proofs that evidences furnished had no legs to stand on & the whole media gulped it speaks of the bias. The Judiciary is the leading conspirator doing it again & again, the need for middnight bail to Teesta on a HC Judgement !!  India is a unique democracy where the dynasties govern  rule the 4 pillar be it judiciary politicians, media & the bureucracy. Merit has no place in India, it is your birth and conection that will decide how much crumbs u get, aam admi will forever forced to remain mere maai-baap paisa dedo do na. mat maro na, mafa kar do with no crimes . heads of pillar call off the bluffs & admit it yes you indians are slaves .</comment>
