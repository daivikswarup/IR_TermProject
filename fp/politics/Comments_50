<comment>Just 2 weeks ago , ABVP vandalized the office of the prinicipal of KiroMal College in delhi.Here are a few more examples of patriotic and non-ANARCHICAL activities of ABVP - </comment>

<comment>To Dear Rohit Vemula,I feel deeply sad for what happened to you. May your soul rest in peace.However, I can’t suppress my anger and disappointed about what you did to yourself and your parents.Today’s generation is far more fortunate than any previous generations when it comes to matters of education, equality and job. Many problems still persist, but our parents and grandparents suffered far worse adversities than us, but they never gave up. If they had given up and run away from life, we wouldn’t be here today.When you decided to give up and run away from life, you just gave up on your parents, who struggled all their life to bring you up and tried to give you a good life that they did not have. You chose to opt for the path of the weak, who think that they do not have the strength to overcome challenges in life. You undermined your own capability and chose to ignore the trust your parents reposed on you.Perhaps, you could have waited for some more time, explored many other alternatives, or thought for a moment about the struggle of our previous generations. Think about the millions of people died fighting for the independence of this country, the millions who lived through untouchability and poverty but never gave up. They lived their life through extreme struggle, trying to ensure a better life for their next generation.Everyday, hundreds of poor people die of decease and hunger, in this country. Many of them did not have the opportunity to go to college and earn a university degree like you. But they are never remembered and nobody is there to fight for them.I am sad that you gave up so soon, so quickly…May the young generation of this country be strong and take the blame on their shoulders and fight against the challenges and be a winner in life….Rajesh</comment>

<comment>Maybe a case should be filed against this man under SC/ST atrocities act for what he continues to say about ASA ? We will suggest this to ASAand file a case against him on this now.</comment>

<comment>This is called freedom of speech. No one should criticise bad elements working behind the ASA.</comment>

<comment>You better file a case against yourself under the SC/ST atrocities act, because you are glorifying a main who insulted ASA by complaining about the bad elements who joined it.</comment>

<comment>This man should have a defamation case filed against him. How dare he even after rohith's death stick to the sordid saga of posters talking about blood ?who believes this nonsense? he had a false case registered using his appendicitis and is talking nonsense now. why the hell does he not answer,how dare they mobilise the HRD ministry and Labour minister to settle petty partisan party scores ? How dare he instigate misuse of state power ? What the hell is wrong with odffering namaz to anyone - their posts are online stating clearly they were against death penalty . WHo the hell is the ABVP to define what is anti-national ? When he was alive, they called him anti-national, now because his death ahs caused all this mobilisations, now he's become a promising researcher. This is their strategy but nobody is going to get fooled any longer with this crap. Basically now they thought by plying petty politics they will come in teh limelight of their leaders given that BJP is in power and seeing his plans foiled has led to this setback . Shameless people , they will not learn.</comment>

<comment>For what reason will you frame a defamation case? He is asking for a proper enquiry into the matter to bring out the culprits. Why are no one asking for it when they are only protesting his death? Shouldn't   they ask for a CBI enquiry?</comment>

<comment>From your reaction, one can understand what is the nature of ASA members. You will not allow anyone to bring about the truth. Why not respect Rohit Vemula's suicide note when he says no one is responsible and do not trouble anyone. You guys are the suspect now.</comment>

<comment>Throw so many rocks that the water gets muddied</comment>

<comment>Regarding Mob attack on Tanzanian females in Bengaluru.  It is naked truth that India is Ocholocracy[mob rule] and not democracy. In a democracy Individual rights are protected even if he is ANYBODY. That anybody could be a curd rice eater[brahmin], or Capitalist agent[I heard in my childhood that a foreman was thrown into a blast furnace by proletarian mob], ABVP student[Rohit Vemula is alleged to have acted like that he was part of mob].Consider example of Bangalore in 2014 -Bangalore city and Bruhat (areas surrounding Bangalore which are newly developed) Bangalore has 28 MLA seats. Bangalore and Bruhat Bangalore has approximately one crore population.Karnataka has six crore population.Karnataka legislature assembly has 224 seats.Population per seat in Bangalore = 357,143Population per seat in Karnataka apart from Bangalore=( 6-1) crores/ (224-28) = 255102Disenfranchisement ratio of Urban Voter = 255102/347143 = 0.73. If other urban centres are taken into account in Bangalore, the ratio is expected to fall further. If Ratio is equal to one, there is no disenfranchisement at all.[Disenfranchisement ratio = Per seat population of Karnataka apart from Bangalore divided by Per seat Population of Bangalore]The system has not been able to correct itself, hence it has subverted itself. Why did emancipation take place? Political parties, state has emancipated themselves from democracy by the vehicle of reservation policy.That is because stable VOTE BANKS are formed. India was never a democracy – it was Ocholocracy[mob rule] where by definition individual rights are murdered. Socialism, unlike voluntary charity, introduced into constitution during emergency [with BJP/RSS in jail] is by definition legal robbery.</comment>

<comment>let have a proper prob the truth need to come out who long these killers can hide under the fake  secular mask, I have seen his facebook posts, over the year he was victimized to this students politics and when he started criticizing the ASA and SFI for misleading him this incidence occurred</comment>

<comment>“an orchestrated campaign to instigate''Very ironic coming from a sangh affiliate .</comment>

<comment>Politicising the sordid episode involving  suicide by a student will lead us nowhere. The need of the hour was to go deep into the incident so as to find the root case.</comment>

<comment>FYIVeer Savarkar (he was no veer by any means..his real name Vinayak Damodar Savarkar) as popularly called by Hindu fanatics of RSS/BJP, committed suicide in fear of being arrested and hung after being found to be the mastermind behind Gandhi's assassination. He was found to be guilty by a the enquiry commission set up on the request of Sardar Patel.Irony, now both are owned by RSS/BJP/SANGO PARIVAR.Now Rohith is being ostracized by these bigots even after death. They are trying to build a narrative around this young man that is the very insult Rohith was eluding at in his note.</comment>

<comment>Drunken speech. If you are brave, how many days can u live in cellular jail? We do not deserve to speak about elders who lived decades before.</comment>

<comment>1. Unlike him, I did not steal secrets to make explosives from a foreign land.2. Unlike him I am not aligned with fascist regimes. 3. Unlike him I do not support or actively involve in violence. 4. You cannot go by the person's ability to stay in jail to judge his moral bearings. If a criminal gets imprisoned and punished for a life, you cannot call that man a veer. Because he has earned that and cannot lay claim to fame by declaring his ability to live in prison. Prisoners have no choice. Unfortunately there are people who spend their life and die in prison. We can't proclaim everybody a veer. 4. If I am jailed for a cause I believe in, I sure would live there as long as it is necessary.  Unlike him, I definitely wouldn't sell my soul and su** ck up to the people who put me there. He wrote to the British begging for his release, offering his cooperation,  essentially sold himself to them.5. He plotted and masterminded the assassination of the most revered elder who was and is the very identity of India and revered world over. This man deserves no respect, but utter contempt. 6. If anybody deserves a veer title it is Bhagath Singh and Bose.</comment>

<comment>I too believe in such conspiracy theories.1) Sanjay Gandhi was murdered  by his mother not killed in accident as he knew his mothers sexual escapades and wanted to stop them.2)Indira Gandhi was not assassinated but had contracted AIDS in order to save India from huge embarrassment she ordered her gunmen to pump bullets.3) Rajiv Gandhi committed suicide because he knew if any non congress govt would be formed he would be in Tihar because of Bofors scam.</comment>

<comment>this was d craziest comment actually :)</comment>

<comment>This is probably the man who escaped from the Mental hospital.</comment>

<comment>Profile name suits you. Probably you need to educate yourself on some of your people's history. Take some time reading up about how Sardar Patel was instrumental in the investigation.  Also, how Dr. Ambedkar intervened for the release of Savarkar. Lots of fine details get lost when a new false enigmatic image was created, like what were his intentions, who were his associates. Learn more about this man .I really don't care about Gandhi dynasty.  </comment>

<comment>always a  coin has two faces. one with communists and another with abvp</comment>

<comment>right. the police inquiry needs to be impartial, apolitcal, and fast.</comment>

<comment>INDIAN PEOPLE ARE DISAPPOINTED IN MODI'S FAILURES-------------------Indian people are so disappointed with Narendra Modi that 2019 has started looking like 1977 again. Indian men are angry and Indian women are disappointed at how this feku from Gujarat and his 40 chor and 5 choranis have done nothing to change how things were in India under Congress but made it worse. Black money was promised within 100 days but not a single paisa is brought back yet, nobody has gone to jail for corruption. Suresh Kalamadi is free, A. Raja is free, Kanimozi is free, Sharad Pawar is free,…. Nobody has gone to jail  but on top of that Modi has delivered his own corruption, nepotism and incompetency through Arun Jaitlley’s DDCA corruption, Sushma Swaraj’s misuse of office, nepotism and breaking the law, Vasundhara Raje’s blatant misuse of power and helping a criminal Lalit Modi, the Vyapam scam and murders, Chattisgargh PDS scam, Smiriti Irani’s lying under oath about education, religious intolerance and killing of Muslims, increasing fanaticism and making a laughing stock of India with gayish behavior on world stage by hugging Western leaders all the time. Modi and his nincompoop goons could not protect India at Pathakot terrorist attacks on Indian soil… We only wish that BJP had selected a family loving man, a good husband and good father Nitish Kumar in 2014 instead of this Feku Modi.</comment>

<comment>You are also free. Yes, feku needs to be punished for keeping the likes of you free! LOL.</comment>

<comment>Be Fair.... Everybody is looking for the black money and Rs 15 lakhs that Modi promised to everybody within 100 days. Did you check Mod's black hole? Is the Swiss black money stuck there?</comment>

<comment>Come on, the Congis have already hidden. It will take some time to get it out. Appreciate Modi for his sincerity. He is not running after petty issues like RG to gain popularity.</comment>

<comment>You are in denial.....  India would have been better off with Nitish Kumar’s leadership who has a clean character unlike Modi, never been convicted like Modi has been, is a loving husband unlike Modi is, a responsible father unlike Modi could never be and a better administrator unlike Modi is. Nitish Kumar also has never played up religious communities to spread hatred and violence like Modi is doing. India is very disappointed with Narendra Modi and Amit Shah for making India worse than Congress did in 68 years.</comment>

<comment>Yaaa.. You are Right... Would have been better with Nitish Kumar. So that he would use the attorney general and all the influence to make Lalu free and the lift the ban on him from contesting elections. Shame on you. Note: I was a admirer of Nitish, Chandra babu for the kind of administration they did. But to win the elections and stay relevant Nitish has come down to the least.</comment>

<comment>i think you urself are Nitish kumar. as the CM have no work coz most of the work is handled by Laloo and the family.i mean who in this world will support Nitish kumar. and in most of ur [ost u have d sme comment that Nitish is better.</comment>

<comment>we the fordfoundation is paying for this crap ..but not for long</comment>

<comment>Gandhi mother and son are free too. Laloo is free. Also Shiela Dikshit is free still. Some one had said that she will be punished after the elections.</comment>

<comment>Right at the beginning I said Rohith was murdered and hung by his organization for political gains.  Deceased person's father's statement is a proof to that. The objective - attack and defame Modi - some how get him exit the PM's office so that the others can bring in Congress and continue with the loot.  The loot has now stopped and the flow of slush money disappeared.  Attack Modi, bring down the Centre Government - bring back lame Congress to seize the loot seem to be the entire strategy of opposition.</comment>

<comment>We do know the students including Rohit were expelled under political Pressure coming from the top,we also know that the ABVP president of the university  was admitted to the hospital for appendicitis  and not for assault  ,so he basically lied to frame  Rohit with serious charges .Now how do we believe this guy ?</comment>

<comment>Hahaha dats a real Doggy from you man !  You meant to say Doctors in the Hospital can't distinguish between an assault and an appendicitis affliction.Shut up and jack up doggy.</comment>

<comment>so what you say about the second page of his suicide note, and the facebook posts and the support to terrorist and the realization of the trap he is in to which he has mentioned in the note</comment>

<comment>Terrorists killed him ?</comment>

<comment>What if People think his suicide is plotted by ASA ?</comment>

<comment>It wasn't a suicide at all .... it was a kill by his own hunting mates !</comment>

<comment>That's exactly what Susheel has raised and the public have believed. Key points have been conveniently ignored by the MSM and RaGa's team of hitmen.</comment>

<comment>You realize - Susheel in fact has let down his organisation by revealing the fact so late.   The very next day it was clearer for any person with a little extra sense to know that this was a murder and not a suicide.When you make statements late, it loses its impact and effect.</comment>

<comment>No. I still remember he raised this question the very next day but MSM by and large ignored it deliberately and he was shouted down in the media.</comment>

<comment>That is okay. When it goes to the court, it will still hear what Susheel has to say. As long as the truth survives, everything is pardonable.</comment>

<comment>couldn't agree more that that with you Manga /!</comment>

<comment>On the expected lines. Time to end/burn it !</comment>

<comment>NOW he doesn't want political interferences, does he? How does it feel to be powerless before the big boys of politics. Now he is talking of different ideologies and conspiracy theories. Couldn't you have learnt be tolerant of opposing views earlier, susheel?</comment>

<comment>You are toeing Rahul's lines. Susheel has raised valid questions for which your lot has no answers. Hence the "indignation".</comment>

<comment>What valid questions?</comment>

<comment>Rohit's father had pointed towards those other four students?Rohit had heavily criticised the Sita Ram Yechuri when later visited the HCU some time back and had asked him on face book that why there is no Dalit member in CPM's polit bureau till date.Rohit's father had said that they are not datit but obc.It is possible that those four other members may have black mailed the Rohit for his wrong doing about caste certificate.</comment>

<comment>too late isn't it</comment>

<comment>its never too late</comment>
