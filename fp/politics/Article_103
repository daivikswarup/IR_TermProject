A massive loss in Bihar triggered a backlash from within the party over its campaign.Sonowal currently holds independent charge of Sports and Youths Affairs Ministry.Javadekar parried a query on whether Sonowal will be the party's chief ministerial face, saying a decision will be taken by the Parliamentary Board at an appropriate time."This is the beginning of our election preparation for Assam.
