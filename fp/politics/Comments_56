<comment>Jammu and Ladakh have suffered discrimination and neglect since Independence. Even though Jammu generates more revenue, the representation in J&K Assembly is less. The Valley enjoys the lion's share of development spending. There is no fair play in the Administration. The Valley has largely been purged of its native Hindu population. Article 370 is "as dangerous as cancer" and has been used by power elites and vested interests in bureaucracy, business and the law courts in Srinagar as an instrument of exploitation. The only way to cure cancer is to remove the patient's organs or body parts. The best solution is to make Kashmir a buffer state like Bhutan or a guarded neutrality similar to Switzerland. Scrap Article 370 and grant statehood or UT status for jammu and Ladakh. The status of Hindus in Pakistan is infinitely worse than that of the Muslims in India. So any solution that involves Hindus ending up in Pakistan is far worse than a solution involving Muslims ending up in India. The Pandits have already migrated out of the valley and PDP is not keen on their resettlement. So spending time and money on the Valley is   wasteful exercise</comment>
