<comment>LOL - I wonder why he didn't file complaints against the actual intolerant comments made by the esteemed members of his favorite chaddi party. Selective outrage doesn't cut any ice. Every Indian has the full right to express views however palatable it may be to anyone else. Anyone trying to bully people by filing complaints should be the ones put in jail for doing so.</comment>

<comment>Appreciate your comment Bikni.</comment>

<comment>dangerous if only praise is acceptable</comment>

<comment>The new blockbuster bollywood Movie, Name : The Gold of Tipu Sultan, Script: Girish Karnat, Hero: Aamir Khan, Music:AR Rahman, Director : ToBeDecided Producer: Narayana Murthy. The film should be a colorful, action-packed western thriller with suspense , masala ,  horse riding and dance  like MacKenna s Gold or Mohra. The film should be dubbed in all languages  and released all over the world</comment>

<comment>Many of these people shouting about intolerance dont remember the Emergency under Indira Gandhi. That was government sponsored intolerance. Today, India is miles head of developed nations in terms of tolerance. Currently the top 3 front runners of the republican presidential candidate pool in the US think that ALL muslims are terrorists because of ISIS. But calling the US intolerant is unfashionable.</comment>

<comment>The rich people who  want a luxurious life had always looked at   Dubai, Singapore, London or USA. Canada is an ideal place for peaceful vacation. Landing in USA by hook or crook had been the dream of English schooled literates. Such people never has the intention of making any sacrifice for their mother country. People like SRK, Aamir Khan and Narayana Murthy are fabulously rich. The cong and sekulars were very much in favor of protecting their disproportionate wealth through tax evasion and corrupt deals. That is the reason why Modi is facing such a terrific hostility. Considering the next state assembly elections, BJP should take damage control measures</comment>

<comment>celebrities should think about their status and duties before making such statements...does this apply to our politicians too, who realizes no responsibility or shame whatsoever and talks nonsense. Specifically, idiots like some sadhus and sadhvis.</comment>

<comment>I think he played the role of 3 idiots.It suits him better.Breathing the air drinking the water eating the grains grown in this sacred land still he isplaying in the hands of antinationals.May be jealous of Modis rising graph.</comment>

<comment>Seeing the various comments in Twitter, FB and other such media, Amir Khan has won the debate hands down! This was the ugly side that all the protesters were afraid of. Ultimately they saw this long before the first hate mail went against them.</comment>

<comment>Aamir Khan has freedom speech. Those who disagree are indulging in hate speech. Aamir Khan is a political opportunist who used his wife as a mouthpiece. As per the 2 Nation Theory, which was accepted, he should not have been in India.</comment>

<comment>And you should be in jail, unfortunately you are not! </comment>

<comment>Nop just like no case against owaisi n azam Khan.. They r sick ppl u me n amir khan r not..</comment>

<comment>As there are no scams, Intolerance issue is a pseudo-scam, created by pseudo-secularists in pseudo-democracy [Socialism was introduced under terror of emergency and socialism is legal robbery as distinct from charity], created with people with pseudo-ideal of equality. Pseudo-news channels [all news is generated from their armchairs] spread it.When will BJP go for privatization and free gun laws? It will remove all pseudos in one stroke. Guns wakes up people.</comment>

<comment>Even if there is intolerance as Aamir believes, celebrities like him should try and be part of the solution rather than flaming it further. I am sure people of his stature can definitely get the attention of few ears from those who matter. Why make statements in public and percolate his feelings to his fans?</comment>

<comment>They make statements because they are the problem.</comment>

<comment>The comments bellow shows how intolerant the supporter of present regime are and how correct Amir Khan is... but very soon India shall get rid of them... The 'ulti ginti' for Modi regime has already started... Bhakts are only further accelerating its speed by their abuses and filthy comments full with poison and hatred...</comment>

<comment>Nop its not hatered against Muslims its hatered against ppl who try to divide b it politics of appeasement or politics of Hindu nation..all r bad...Amir n family r so insecure then the can go to Paris or america n try to see what hatered is..</comment>

<comment>The Congress trounced the BJP in the Ratlam Lok Sabha By-election.</comment>

<comment>Yap its traditional congress seat..I m from m.p and trust me they r history there for good..</comment>

<comment>Amir's wife says she wants to leave India for safety of their children ..And Martyr Colonel Santosh Mahdik's wife says both her children will join Indian Army to safeguard our nation...Jai Hind..\m/.Time to re-think about definition of our Heroes.....:))</comment>

<comment>Why is no one responding to it?</comment>

<comment>this jihadi aamir khan and his masters (congress) must be laughing at BJP's reaction to the statement...stop reacting to such non sense, counter them with logical response...where were aamir khan, when actress/model gauhar khan was slapped by a jihadi for wearing short clothes? expose them by issuing controversial statement about islam and muhammad, its not that difficult to instigate the muzzies, they are an easy pick..instead these BJP idiots are behaving like kids...</comment>

<comment>Christianity does not accept any other belief or faith. If a person goes to an rss school or Islamic madrasah school, does the education they receive influence their mind and opinion?Aamir Khan educated at Saint Anne's High school, Christian missionary School.Shah Rukh Khan educated in St. Columba's School, Christian missionary schoolSaif Ali Khan educated in The Lawrence School, Christian missionary school.Salman khan educated in St. Stanislaus High School Christian missionary school.Akshay Kumar educated in Don Bosco High School Christian missionary school.Ranbir kapoor educated in Bombay Scottish school Christian missionary school.Deepika Padukone educated in Sophia high school, Christian missionary schoolRajdeep Sardesai educated in Saint Xavier college a Christian missionary schoolBarkha dutt educated in Saint Stephens college a Christian missionary schoolArundhati educated in Corpus Christi college a Christian missionary schoolArvind Kejriwal educated in Christian missionary school in Sonipat, worked with missionaries of charity and mother TheresaRavish kumar educated in Loyola high school a Christian missionary schoolShobhaa de educated in Saint Xavier college a Christian missionary schoolSagarika Ghose educated in Saint Stephens college a Christian missionary schoolShereen Bhan educated in saint Stephens college a Christian missionary schoolSweta Singh educated in Patna university, heavily influenced by Christian missionaryCyrus broacha educated in Saint Xavier's college, a Christian missionary schoolKaran Thapoor educated saint Anthony's college, a Christian origin collegeVikram Chandra educated Saint Stephens college, a Christian missionary schoolArnab goswami educated Saint Anthony's college, a Christian origin collegeShoma Chaudhury educated in Saint Helens covent, a Christian missionary schoolNarasimhan Ram educated in Loyola college, a Christian missionary school.Hundreds of journalist, editors, directors are educated in Christian missionary schools.(PLEASE add more names of people educated at Christian rss missionary schools)Why is the mainstream media in India wholly educated in European Christian missionary religious schools, is this secularism? Watch how Christian Bhakts attack one religious ideology then defend a Christian European one...............goes to show the colonial western mentality we still live with, where it's ok to be indoctrinated at a religious Christian school of foreign extraction, but a native Hindu religious rss school is questioned. The European Christian educated Indians are taught to doubt, be negative, derogatory against Indianness but adopting western values, culture, history, ideology, even the bollywood movies are a direct imitation of the west. It's also amusing that while over two million Muslims are fleeing Middle East countries run to islamic law, thousand ps of Muslims killed, attacked, tortured by other Muslims, civil war in many Muslims countries with no rule of law, Amir khan thinks after one incident of a Muslim death, and a few faces with blacked ink, India is more intolerable than the Middle East where millions are fleeing and dying everyday. Africa also constant terrorist attacks, kidnapping, South America has the highest murder and crime rate, North America, USA, the highest prison population, rape, gun shooting, gang related crime, highest drug consumer......................But then again since Amir and his media buddies all went to a Christian Western English education then it's fair to say, in the same way the media claim a person who is educated at rss school will have certain view point and opinions, then it's very easy to say and see why people like Amir khan and the media speak in the baseless, negative, doubtful, agenda driven, pro western, pro Christian and anti Indian, anti Hindu tone that they do.......because they went to a Christian RELIGIOUS education, from the same European Christians that enslaved, invaded, colonised and converted the world.Maybe amir khan go to Saudi Arabia or any I mean any other Islamic country if he feels safer there, In a Hindu society a Muslim actor has earned millions. While ridiculing Hindu gods in his movies, this is tolerance they accept.While Sikhs wonder tolerance where they talking of during their massacre and then denial by mainstream media.</comment>

<comment>Choosing a wrong enemy can be fatal.Intolerance debate was a communist conspiracy - fools have walked into the trap, like Biharis.The 100% genuine intolerance is intolerance against inequality. Once the communist parties ARE BANNED the trend becomes HEADLESS. But the problem is BJP is cowardly on everything - it does not want to ban communist parties, it does not want to privatize, it cannot even consider the arguments for free Gun laws, it does not want to make buying and selling of votes legal to shatter the stable vote banks of reservation policy. Jo dar gaya Samjo who margaya.</comment>

<comment>all abrahamic cults are same...if the jews really starts following the teachings of Torah (judaism), it would probably become even worse than the rest of the two combined together (Islam & christianity)...the problem is they lack in numbers, the nazis alone killed 6 million jews during the holocaust...what you posted is true but is of no use, unless the hindus realizes what's happening with them bcoz of the competition b/w these abrahamic cults...</comment>

<comment>And you are? Who are you?  Jihadi Aamir Khan? Where is your brain, son?</comment>

<comment>^^^ intolerant congi jihadi spotted</comment>
