<comment>Beware ! It is a visible fact that Congress party run by Italian-mothertongues have no Indian patriotism and are like self-destructive suicide-bombers hell-bent on causing disruptions in the functioning of democratic institutions of Parliament & Assemblies with deliberate distractions, delays so thatour country does not progress.  Unless their followers wake up and throw them out, we can't achieve the development so keenly championed byPM Modiji.</comment>

<comment>I also want to see that GST bill is passed. But there is very thin borderline between traitors and disruptionists. One is violent and the other is suavely non-violent. Former is Moists and the later is communists. And Congress has taken the robes of Communists. They have almost decided to toe the line of Communists in Bengal. Daggers of steel and daggers made of ice have the same effect when thrust in body. Congress holds daggers of ice. I think they will certainly try to road blocks in way of GST bill..</comment>

<comment>I know its f00lish.. but BJP can just forget GST and go back to ordinance rule.. Its not worth trying to liaison with anti-nationals.</comment>

<comment>IF DONKAIKH DONKEY WANTS CONSENSUS,THEN HE SHOULD MAKE HIS STANTD CLEAR ON CONGRESS DEMANDS OF CONSTITUTIONAL CAP AND SEPARATE DISPUTE  REDRESSAL BODY</comment>

<comment>Upper cap on gst tax what a crap demand.  When country is in bad shape when you need more revenue, you can only knock the doors of citizen. you can't change Constitution change upper cap. Other 2 can be met but there are States like WB they won't create atmosphere to help industries so 1% is really good for States creating good manufacturing atmosphere. </comment>
