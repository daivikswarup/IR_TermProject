Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani’s diktat to central universities in the country to hoist the national flag atop seems to have had a boomerang effect on BJP’s parent organisation – the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS).Congress workers hoisted the national flag at the RSS office in Indore. Debobrat Ghose/FirstpostIn an unusual incident in the BJP-ruled state of Madhya Pradesh, the state unit of the Congress party on Monday made a forced entry into the RSS office at Indore and hoisted the Tiranga at the roof top.During the day, hundreds of workers from the state Congress, Youth Congress, Mahila Congress (women’s wing) and its students wing NSUI, led by the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president Arun Yadav, gathered at the Rajwada Chowk — a historical centre in Indore city.After garlanding the bust of Mata Ahilya Devi, the Congress leaders and workers marched towards the Sangh office. Breaking the police barricades and simultaneously raising slogans, the Congress workers virtually forced themselves inside the RSS office and, in the presence of Sangh members, hoisted the national flag.Barring national events like Republic Day, Independence Day, the Sangh offices and Shakhas don’t hoist national flag on a regular day, and instead hoists its traditional saffron (Bhagwa) flag.To evade any untoward incident, a large police force was deployed at the location. The entire Rajwada area was full of national flags and placards. However, the citizens of Indore witnessed a peaceful flag hoisting both by the Congress workers and the RSS members.“It’s a historical moment as Congress hoisted Tiranga at RSS office. We wanted to expose the hypocrisy of the RSS, because the latter never hoists Tiranga at its centres on a regular day and instead hoists its own saffron flag. The state Congress party decided to hoist national flag to show that the organization that talks of nationalism and patriotism, and demands nationalism certificate from people is a hypocrite,” a local Congress member told Firstpost.
