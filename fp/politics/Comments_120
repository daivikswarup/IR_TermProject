<comment>1st Phase voting is not in favour of NDA. Higher voting percentage expected by NDA not happened. 57% voting is only 0.7% higher than 56.3% of General Election 2014. Being a state assembly poll, voting percentage was expected to be at least 3% higher. Wait and see next phases.</comment>

<comment>Why are you comparing general elections voting percentage with assembly elections? you are a buffoon.. anyway.. which party secured more seats in general elections anyway? with 56.3% as you mentioned?</comment>

<comment>I like NDA to get an upper hand. But we cannot ignore the reality. Newspapers and NDA supporters comparing 2010 numbers with 2015 ... the color of politics and the alliances all changed completely. Comparing with 2014 is more correct. What I wrote is correct ..... proved by strategy change in the middle of the election by NDA (announcing a CM candidate)????</comment>

<comment>:) very good question.... I love reading and read a lot of books which includes preachings not only from hindus, quran, bible etc you name it... after you read all these you will know the pros and cons of all the system.. the best thing to do is implement only what is being said good in those books.. and ignore the rest.. I understood how the caste systems evolved.. how it got superior.. and how it loses charm.. seeing all these you will tend to ignore the basic belief of god.. thats all.. but since I does not belive in something does not mean others should follow me.. let them follow whatever they want.. but nobody has a right to criticise one another in the name of religion.. and thats when I pitch in.</comment>

<comment>One of the moron here questioned me about the UCC and article 370 here is the answer.. firstly article 370... did you ever care to read it? the article clearly mentions that if the article 370 has to be scrapped the initiation has to come first from the J&K assembly.. after which the centre will acknowledge and scrap it.. currently BJP does not have 2/3rd strength in J&K assembly even if Modi wants to scrap it.. he cant.. secondly the UCC is the most controvercial thing.. it must be implemented when our people gets matured and stops fighting for caste and also there should not be any caste based reservation system.. only then UCC can be implemented.. which according to me if Modi is the ruler for next 30 years.. we can implement it..</comment>

<comment>Hehe...extra sambar please</comment>

<comment>hahahahahahaha Congarats.... You can only be happy and enjoy till Nov 8th after which even if you close your ears and eyes you would be forced to know that BJP WON THE ELECTIONS......</comment>

<comment>Task of BJP is to ensure in future that it wins even with low voter turnout. 1)Many people [especially tribals] dont care for Refrigerator, car etc. They will be thrilled with Guns. Ask any Jarawa Tribal in Andaman. Make free gun laws as in USA2)Make freedom to  buy and sell votes to shatter the stable vote banks of reservation politics. After all Parliament has ceased to function - precisely because political parties and bureaucracy have emancipated from democracy.3)With level playing field ensured in election go for all out privatization to increase size of cake</comment>

<comment>Sandipan Sharma has tried his best to hide the fact that BJP has romped home in the first round. This is the trend to follow in other rounds too with higher voter turnout. Nitish and Laloo will have just time to defend the corrupt  ministers of JDU. The final score will be :  NDA 165+  Nitish+ Laloo 45+  Congress: 2-3  Others- rest. Intelligent Biharis! Wake up! Don't lose the golden opportunity to bring Golden days to Bihar ! Only Karmayogi Modi can do it  and  nobody else. Don't waste your vote with Nitish or Laloo. AWAKE !!!</comment>

<comment>There is no doubt that BJP is winningThe undercurrent is strong and Nitish is just better that Lalu in terms of governance much better but in absolute terms he has been a filaure as he has failed on most fronts most importantly education and job creation (or private investment) The list of failure is long Even roads are not what they used to be Electricity is another failure</comment>

<comment>If Snadeepan Sharma is saying one has to wait till last set and the prolonged dues, one should be serious , because Sandeepan might have declared victory of JD(U) even if it had .005% chance of winning and might have given the title "Will Modi resign from Delhi now."  Even .005% chance is not there, that is why sandeepan is worried and is playing it safe.</comment>

<comment>Nitesh ji ki jai ho, Nitesh ji ki jai ho, Nitesh ji ki jai hoooo</comment>

<comment>The new Government should at least pretend to curtail the kidnapping in the state. Kidnappers can probably follow some reservation system, where they will decide in advance on the number of people to be kidnapped from each caste. This will bring some predictability, and also ransom can be fixed based on the caste. The deals between the kidnappers, police and the political leaders should also be formalized, and the whole kidnapping process should be streamlined to make everybody's life or death easier.</comment>

<comment>BJP will win hands down</comment>

<comment>NO need to think.Just see the writer name and conclude yourself the exact opposite what he says in headline.Don't waste time what he writes.Because he has already made his image like this only for publicity.200% proved with evidence and history.</comment>

<comment>For the first time i see Mr.Sandipan Sharma trying to be subtle and accepting that the young voters and the higher percentage of voting would mean optimism for NDA. What has happened Mr.Sandipan?</comment>

<comment>Because Truth is always truth. Whether some person don't want to accept the reality for their arrogance and selective intellect.</comment>

<comment>higher voting percentage indicates BJP led NDA winning !!!</comment>
