<comment>What if some Indians want to screww mother and Indians want to screww motherland?? Is this the reason why Indian men have difficulty in have girl friends and India does not want to get involved in wars outside India, and is deeply INWARD looking?Sigmund Freud father of psychoanalysis said "mother worship" when asked to define India. Continuing this analysis::Arnab Goswami goes slightly wrong when he says even left loves India. Love non-mediated by religion turns motherly love to love for female. That is why Left is intent of screwwing India. That love is sexual love for mother, motherland. Jats and Kapus in Andhra Pradesh[who have burnt a train] are demanding reservation. That is again immoral sexual love for motherland.Such effect of predatory sexual love for motherland [nothing wrong with motherly love]has even led to murder of motherland in history as following shows..Dahir was BRAHMIN King in Sindh. By enlisting the support of local tribes (such as the Jats, Meds and Bhuttos) and Buddhist rulers of Nerun, Bajhra, Kaka Kolak and Siwistan as infantry to his predominantly-mounted army, Muhammad bin Qasim defeated Dahir and captured his eastern territories for the Umayyad Caliphate.Dahir then tried to prevent Qasim from crossing the Indus River, moving his forces to its eastern banks. Eventually, however, Qasim crossed and defeated forces at Jitor led by Jaisiah (Dahir's son). Qasim fought Dahir at Raor (near modern Nawabshah) in 712, killing him; Dahir's wife immolated herself (with other women in her household) in accordance with the Hindu tradition of Jauhar.========================================================Academicians have swallowed a fascist lie spread by media that India is a democracy.What a Joke! What about the assault on Individual right of merit by reservation policy? In which country are cities brought to a halt by bandhs? Media should first say India was a Ocholocracy[mob rule].India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] not a democracy. Free speech can be explosive unless it is a part of movement to uproot the Ocholocracy. In a Ocholocracy INDIVIDUAL rights are murdered by definition with help of state. Examples of murder of INDIVIDUAL right are reservation policy which is murder of merit, an INDIVIDUAL right and socialism(by definition legal robbery) which is murder property right, another INDIVIDUAL right.Why are Indians not trusted with free gun laws as in USA? Answer to this simple question demolishes free speech argument.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why were leftists associated with secessionists? The culture of socialist legal robbery is manifesting itself as secessionism - because the socialists may have realized it is impossible to come to an understanding on who the supreme dictator should be and they want to establish numerous single part dictatorships over fragments of country. Socialism has to lead to single party dictatorships over fragments of country.Adam Smith, the father of economics, says in economics Man Proposes and God Disposes. If every body in a nation become do-gooders -- God disposes -- and we will have hell on earth. if man proposes to be selfish -- God again disposes -- and we will have prosperity and peace.Giving rational explanation of God, the elder do-gooders , MK Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Ambedkar etc forgot that a strong socialist state is required to do good. And it will demand its pound of flesh closest to the heart – rampant corruption. A strong state emerges in an environment of shortages – to distribute scant resources. Any socialist state will NOT destroy the reason for its existence. 24 hour water supply will reduce water required to be released by 30%. No Government Engineer in India will accept this. Scarcity, distress is required for the reason for its existence. If no scarcity exists it will manufacture it. Mysore had water scarcity even though it had KRS dam beside it. It is a question of power. A society can either have equality or freedom but never both. Why? To enforce equality a strong and intrusive state is required. Stateism is against Individualism and kills freedom.Since 1947, the political parties, government need not care as they have attained emancipation from democracy -- principally by the tool of reservation policy, where vote banks are formed. And they will vote according to predictable patterns whatever the rulers do or don't do. In other words India has become a Fascist state[socialism is a necessary component of it --Nazi means National Socialist]by the vehicle of reservation policy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just voting does not make India democracy. Protection of rights of the smallest minority the INDIVIDUAL MAKES A SYSTEM DEMOCRATIC. The problem is, India is an Ocholocracy[mob rule] where Individual rights are murdered[example is murder of merit an Individual right by reservation policy and property rights by socialism. Socialism is legal robbery.A period of good dictatorship may be required to cure Indians of disease of bad democracy, due to the infection of socialism or legal robbery. Otherwise bad democracy can kill in millions like in Cambodia under Pol Pot. Ocholocracy looks like democracy but it is not. Just look at immorality of Indians- Laloo the reason for largest migration of Biharis from Bihar was reelected.-----------------------------------------------------------It is logically wrong to allow communist parties to function in a multi party democracy as they are for single party dictatorship - they openly state it! Ban communist parties===================================================Now BJP/RSS should bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=============================================</comment>

<comment>Going against the spirit of nationhood is a passion now for all.  Gone the days when our blood boiled in the veins reading the fiery speeches of Netaji, Vallabhai to name a couple although we have in our history so many of them in innumerable numbers.Today, the struggle for freedom lives on only in history books and memoirs, and on the tombstones of valiant martyrs. Politics has undergone a personality change from fiery idealism to a self aggrandizing cynicism. True, Karma drives the nation on its way forward and what difficulties we are experiencing today is the result of our Karma.I am pained to see the videos from the land of Netaji where students are engaged in anti national slogans and marching on the street shouting against the existence of this nation's independence, ironically borrowing Netaji's own fiery slogans for independence.Strong forces are in operation in India to divide the Hindus into various platforms for they are convinced that the only disintegration of the Indian nation can be achieved only through division of Hindus and pitting them against each other.It is an irony that no one has time to contemplate what we are today and how we achieved it. But everyone has ample time to mis-direct their intelligence to denigrate the very nation and its freedom for which thousands and thousands fought for a century.  All those souls of who martyred for the country and its freedom to give us today what we have and are, must be wailing at the happenings around the country.If one watches it carefully, one can easily understand that all these are the handi work of the politicians who lost their seat of power in a democratic process, the very democracy which put them in power.  They are intolerable and unable to live through the time without weilding power.The Leftists have never been genuinely a part of the country and they never wanted to integrate with the nation. If they have joined the democratic process it is only due to their hunger for power and not on account of any respect for the democracy or set down rules outlined in our constitution. They always believed that the "power comes through the barrel of a gun" and not through ballot boxes.The very forces which were against Indian nationhood are still active and alive amongst us. Those are the forces which always felt India is not their home and have much more to achieve in the disintegration of India than its unity.Our political forces, in their hunger for power,joined hands with these elements to up-stage the democracy in our country.The focus now has been on dividing the Hindus between regions, castes, backwards, dalits, OBC,Tribes etc.  For they see the disintegration of this great nation can happen only by splintering the Hindus.This is a passing phase for the nation.  Much of its existence now depend on how today's government handle the situation.  If they become indecisive and hesitating, this nation is going to go into different directions demarcated and designed by the politicians and the anti-nationals.  If this government fails, the loss of nationhood solely rest on this government.  They need to act firm and strong in a non-partisan and impartial manner.Will they or won't they? I hope they will rather not.</comment>

<comment>Look at this guy....he has brought Bihar back into the clutches of Lallu's JUNGLE RAJ, for the sake of his own EGO, and he is LECTURING others about 'undoing'!!</comment>

<comment>Nitishwa ka dhoti khul gaya hai.....wo dhoti bachaye ke bihar bachaye ke kya kare..</comment>

<comment>Hooligan Nationalism! JNU Student Union President Kanhaiya got guts to stand-up for student-rights!</comment>

<comment>Charles you are hateful as a nagin.  Students have no right to indulge in anti nationalism.  Your hatred for Hindus is well scripted by you in your various comments over a year now.  Now you have exposed yourself completely by siding with the anti nationals.Your anti nationalistic stand will see your own peril very soon.</comment>

<comment>'When God is with us who can be against us'! Must be a Paki agent trying to destabilize India!</comment>

<comment>The point is you want country  to go to rack and ruin so that you will have lots of beggars to harvest their souls. Just read book "Hitlers Pope" - where Pope supported Hitler and has blood of millions of jews on his hands.</comment>

<comment>We all know Charles what you have been saying for over a year.  Your hatred is so much that you can't stand India and the Hindus.  I understand your zealous affinity towards your adopted faith.  Do not behave like a salvation army whose objective is evangelism and conversion.</comment>

<comment>He is now crying like a baby and denouncing anti India slogans. </comment>

<comment>Jab pichhwade par police ke dande padte hain to bade bade anti - national bhi deshkhakt ban jate hain. This is what has happened to him.</comment>

<comment>Hello everybody….. Emperor Babur here….. I am disappointed by you contiuous infighting, attacking and killing your own men and women. That is exactly how I came from a worse country as a failed knight and conquered your large land. There was nobody at the border to fight. This is called Gujarati syndrome. You and your lazy and darpk kings were busy killing and looting each other. Now I have decided to bring peace by splitting the kingdom into 5 parts. Tamil Nadu will be a separate country united with Sri Lanka. Arunachal Pradesh will be my gift to China for a beautiful Chinese princess in my Janan Khana. Gujarat will be a separate country with no army. Asaram Bapu will be president. Telangana ad Andhra Pradesh will be under Nizam’s rule again. I have brought effective Afghan cream for Telangana CM KC Rao’s burnt nose. My SECOND COMING is imminent. Insha Allah <>></comment>

<comment>Osama Bin LadenJi, Afzal Guru Ji and Bihar Ki Beti is the language used by "Secular" Parties ( Muslim Vote Parties). Nitish refused to arrest Yasin Bhatkal and now giving advice to Modi.</comment>

<comment>NAMO could not defeat Nitish, al last !!!!</comment>

<comment>Glad to see you celebrate the return of Jungle Raj.....anything for the sake of your hatred of Hindus!</comment>

<comment>Thanks, jungleraj at Tishazari court, Delhi</comment>

<comment>in less than four months, Nitish and his Ghatbandan loses bye election.  Where are those who were screaming when nitish won the bihar election through unwholly alliances.</comment>

<comment>"unwholly alliances"Akali Dal observe with celebration birth/death anniversary of Vindrenwala and other terrorists , so alliance between BJP & Akalidal is holly.Zero-tolerance for Afzal Guru protesters in Delhi, undying zeal for a deal in Srinagar with those who believe he was wrongly hanged. BJP's Afzal paradox: hit students, hug PDP ( ) Holly alliance between BJP & PDP</comment>

<comment>Kamal mein bhi kaata hota hein aaajkal.  You are no Kamal or you have any Kanta.  You want to join the anti national group of those who labelled themselves as students for a life time?Nitish's is an unwholly alliance - he ruled the State for ten years in collaboration with his ally BJP; suddenly his personal animosity prioritized him to ally with RJD against whom he worked for ten years.What is wrong with Akali Dal?  Are they anti nationals?if alliance with PDP can give Kashmir a stable govt. and stop the rot there, there is nothing wrong.People of Bihar so soon realized their mistake is a comforting factor; but the disturbing point is that they need to put up with this unwholly alliance for five years.  That is the curse of democracy.</comment>

<comment>hahahaha....nitish first go and save bihar from jungle raj then speak about modi...</comment>
