<comment>no politics over the issue. it should be simple, straight and clear. no such concessions to the nationals of an enemy country whether it is Pak or any other country. even with all other countries it should be on a reciprocal and equality basis. nothing more and nothing less, irrespective of the govt. we have in the states or at the centre.</comment>

<comment>Its high time that the SS also warns our government not to import onions from Pakistan whenever there is shortage here. Let our policies be consistent in all matters.</comment>

<comment>All Pakistani artist are sin of their mothers, should not be allowed to pollute Our country, shiv sena is moving on the right track... shiv sena the true patriot.</comment>

<comment>good move. these chillar packi actors are a dime a dozen. kick them out.</comment>

<comment>That's right. The Sena wont let any actor enter Maharashtra. But if Kasab or any real terrorist runs rampant through Mumbai, these a**holes will hide in their bungalow and squeeze Thakeray's balls. You wont see any bravery then!</comment>

<comment>First a time a terrorist was captured live in Mumbai.All the all India grade IPS officers hid in their shitty holes and only Marathi offcers got killed.</comment>

<comment>Instead of Pakistani actors, punish the Indians who have made movies with them. If it is Shahrukh Khan, then he should be punished. It is a known fact that all Khans in Bollywood are inclined to Pakistan and some of them are actually Paki. agents. Arrest them and subject them to third degree so that the truth can come out.</comment>

<comment>You are insane!</comment>

<comment>Pakistanis nationals are Foreigners in this country. In certain states (e.g. NE), already, foreigners are not allowed - at least not allowed without a permit. There is absolutely no reason to not allow foreigners from any civilized country, but we could certainly make an exception for Pakistani nationals. These people are overstaying their visas. Looks like they are Pampered by the Modi Govt (take the case of Adnan Samy). Hence ALL Indian states should enact a law or even an Ordinance to disallow Pakistani nationals!</comment>

<comment>Agreed that foreign policy should not be decided in streets and diktats.  But being goody goody to a nation who is after our people and have started killing even civilians in the border, can we have good relation! Are we supposed to play cricket with a neighbour which is hell bend on screwing our peace and a country which has never encouraged artists from our country! NO way! Only pak sympathisers like Barkha Dutt, Rajdeep Sardesai, Kishore Bhimani are ranting! Why not take a comprehensive survey on the issue so that we will know what the people of our cuntry feel!</comment>

<comment>The government is basically giving up its right to frame laws and enforce them. Hooligans will decide what happens with Indias foreign policy I presume. It'd be better if the GOI was more proactive and stopped cross border cultural exchanges. Letting goons do the task is just showing up the government to be a bunch of buffoons.</comment>

<comment>So shivsena, are you going to expel (erstwhile, given that he's past 90 now) Bollywood actor Y.M. Khan (more famously known as Dilip Kumar) due to his being born in Utmanzai?</comment>

<comment>well he was born there before Parition moron, not current day Pakistan!</comment>

<comment>Listen south Indian ----------most of the Punjabis of Bollywood are from now days pakistan.All Sindhis are from present day pakistan. Dilip Kumar is an Indian citizen.S.S is against pakistanis.</comment>

<comment>I love Shiv Sena.Atleast there is one party who listens to the public's heart.</comment>

<comment>Another terrorist organization is Shiv Sena. They should not be in control of India's foreign policy decisions!</comment>

<comment>hahahamoron</comment>

<comment>An old language suppressed thus far by Leftist ideology & commie morons in our country since independence is now being spoken more openly & aggressively.  All the Marxist-Leninist monkeys in politics, media, "social activists", etc. are unable to tolerate this "new" discourse & that someone is countering them point by point & attacking their dominance.Rightists are just getting started & Marxists are crying bloody murder already!!!   :DThe level & virulence of public discourse in India is going to go through a sea change in the years to come.......thrilling & exciting to watch & be a part of it!!  :)  Finger lickin' good!Dear Shiv Sena, keep hammering & keep chipping away.  Your work is much needed.  Godspeed!</comment>

<comment>What B.J.P. can't do openly is asking S.S to do publicly.All the dirty work of BJP is done by S.S .Those people esp.industrialists who are complaining to Modi abt S.S policies should remember that S.S wiped out communists from Maharashtra.They should be in fact thank full to S.S........</comment>

<comment>if the commies were wiped out then SS is like gen McArthur was to the US of A after the war.......God bless have NEVER been able to stand Commie ideology ....look what the b@$turds gave to waste Bengal all these years ......desh drohi Morons ....</comment>

<comment>Well said brother.Shiv sena is doing a good job.+1</comment>

<comment>Sena is trying to embarrass BJP by this stunts....Bhakts Vs Sainiks is on the cards...</comment>

<comment>No it's going to be Nationalist v/s Sickulars.</comment>

<comment>so says a kujli dongri baba loving crAAPturd.....full of kujli $hit</comment>

<comment>Good move keep this policy and stop Pak artists, Film stars, Sportsperson from coming to india .Let these Paki Morons also feel the financial pinch !!!</comment>

<comment>Rediff comWill invite Malala with open arms if she comes to India: Shiva Sena:  Amidst their protests against Pakistan, Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut has said that if Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai came to India, she would be welcomed with open arms. "If Malala comes to India, we will welcome her. She's a child who has borne the horror of Pakistan terrorism and till date she continues her fight against terrorism," said Raut.Now Prestitute media and congress will say Malala is also a right wing and she is from RSS !!</comment>

<comment>They fed javed miandad no contradiction there. The so called cub with the woman's voice attended a function featuring a Pakistani! No contradiction there either. </comment>

<comment>Pakistan has hardly allowed any singer or actor to perform there.Lata mangeshkars show was cancelled there.They are harboring dawood ,Hafiz gang and expect talks diplomacy to succeed.Those saying amanki asha and all are idiots.Let them stop watching Indian films and shows and watch Arab belly dance,live fight, war from Arab world</comment>

<comment>It would be a very sad day if we were to follow Pakistani behavior as an example. </comment>

<comment>Its not about behavior any more.. But its about putting a fullstop or atleast a semi-column. Why would some Tom dick and harry kill my family men from the back door and come to entertain me from the front door ??????</comment>

<comment>It is high time these goondaism of shiv sena and other extremist wing is curbed... If Fadnavis has any say in the "law and order" management in Maharashtra then he needs to show these goons who is the boss... If not, then Fadnavis should just bend over with his hands folded while Thackerays keep kicking his rear....</comment>

<comment>Fadnavis seems to be no better at managing law and order than SP. Sad really that a bunch of goondas are able to impose their diktat on everybody else.</comment>

<comment>You can't do anything.These "goondas" are real patriots, touch them if you dare.itne jute padenge ki apna naam bhul jayega.sale suar ki aulaad.</comment>

<comment>To some extent Shiv Sena is the need of the hour. Pakistan playing double standards and they must be shown their true faces. When you say the sports should be kept out of politics.. just remember Javed Miyadad ? Wasn't he a sportsman and now turned as relative to Dawood. Think if I keep on killing your family members and then send a person to play with you or sing with you. Will you allow that to happen ?</comment>

<comment>The same Javed Miandad sportsman relative of Dawood you are talking about was hosted by Bal Thackeray at Matoshree... The same Bal Thackeray nourished and raised under him Arun Gawli akka desi don of the Mumbai.. Thackeray's and RSS are nothing but a bunch of loose goons... And their protest is 'hypocrisy at its sublime best'...</comment>

<comment>So according to your skewed stupid logic, if somebody had hosted someone a long long long time ago, then they have lost their democratic right to protest?Protesting is not limited for just commie tree-hugging marxist morons like your lord AK420 & his Congi masters, but also to Right-wing organizations like Shiv Sena.So STFU & put up with it, 'coz other than lamenting here in an obscure comment section you can do nothing about it.</comment>

<comment>Listen you gau mutra licking, khakhi kaccha  "sanghi" accept that you, and your kinds are fascist bunch of highest category... In your right to protest - all you do is create havoc... You and your kind may have physically grown but have never moved beyond Kaccha Sanghi mindset... Now put up with it, and get lost!</comment>

<comment>They are lot better than half d!cks like you who swallow arab masters saliva and drink camel urine.</comment>

<comment>I have a proper D!ck... Do you wish to experience it in all its greatness down your throat?? It would be a good change from the routine gau mutra gulping therapy...</comment>

<comment>Proper dick? sunta nahee hua kya,?half dicks like you are employed by arabs to swipe their a$$,as water is costlier than half dick pakistanis.After that ram your 8 yr old bride with your teeny weeny penn!s and wash with camel urine.</comment>

<comment>Abey chutiye, le kar dekh le na... Agar santusthi na ho to bolna...</comment>
