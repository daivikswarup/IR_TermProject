<comment>if bjp is forming govt with these anti-national PDP who celebrate afzal guru and call him a martyr.. the flag bearer of nationalism would become anti-national.. don't show double standards.. Nation comes before power.. show some shame.. or else stop calling yourself nationalists.. abki baar hijdon ki sarkar... And this owaishi.. he should be put behind the bar for spreading hatred..</comment>

<comment>he has a point...the bjp ally with pdp can be termed as half baked without any concrete buy in to the ideologies.... there are some key words eaach party wants to own...for mayawati its BACKWARD CLASSSES/dalit....for bjp it is NATIONAL/HINDU......for congress it is FREEDOM STRUGGLE/SECULAR .........</comment>

<comment>The party who's  history tell us that they support razakar to kill innocent peopleNow talking ab8  what is secularism and nationalism ....phehla Nizam ke rule se bahar aawo then talk ab8 this countryThe only solution u have to leave this country and find another one which is govern by shara law....do what ever u want to do there</comment>

<comment>"The BJP gives certificates of nationalism, while the Congress gives certificates of secularism. I request them not to impose their ideology upon others," he added.Wholeheartedly agree with him.</comment>

<comment>Abolish Common Minimun Programme in politicis or stop this ranting slogans like unholy alliance or anti national alliance. It is like the same society which encourages prostitution condemns the same.This requires political parties to recognise that every political party is a democratic one and not to be seen from the point of view of caste, colour or  religion or left or right but to be seen as people centric and nation centric..For nationalism  please do not miisquote Constitution.</comment>

<comment>Owasi must know that all HIJDAS have double standards,they are always hijda cum bhadvas ,PM is no exception</comment>

<comment>Government Brahmins[supporters of reservation policy] are cannibals of merit. Indian state tutors them to NOT see that reservation policy caste certificate holders who murder merit practice cannibalistic culture. The problem is no Nation practicing cannibalism human sacrifice can be a democracy! Bureaucratic Indian state, still follows the laws of British Bureaucracy.Lack of free speech [sedition laws]and reservation policy was promoted and encouraged by British Bureaucracy which saw to it that Indian share of GDP fell from 28% after East India Company's rule to 3%. Brahmins are modern dalits who are sold by the Indian bureaucracy - they even have a plan to bring in reservation in private sector.What is the secret that BJP/Congress policy are always similar. That is because after having both parties call each other anti-national, the moot question remains WHO IS THE NATION? Why are parties subservient to it? NATION  is the Indian bureaucracy, which maintains its power by INTELLIGENT rigging[read indiaevm . org elections by Electronic Voting Machines]. It is the same bureaucracy which makes ease of doing business and nations progress very very low. Unfortunately Modi trusts in the same bureaucracy</comment>

<comment>Yo Hindu Slaves...... Do you see the Taj Mahal? At least in beautiful pictures? How about the Red Fort where your nation looting and corrupt leaders give speeches?  Remember each time that your slave forefathers carried bricks day in and day out with Mughul lashes... they did not eat Mughlai Chicken Biryani or Shahi Beef Kabob... That is luxury food..... Remember that each time you eat Mughlai food in expensive Indian restaurants. You like fair skin and long legs of Katrina Kaif, Alisha Bi (Hema Malini), Tabu, Saira Banu and Shabana Azmi? ..... my soldiers gave Mughul genes to your short and dark Dravidian women. Thank Allah for not having to see actors like Rajnikanth every day.... Once a slave... always a slave..... You all have Mughul blood... Auarangabad, Gaziabad, Islampur, Shayari, Music, Dance, Architecture....It is everywhere.... You cannot erase your coward history of 1,000 years......Now get back to work... No slacking... Babri Masjid must be completed on schedule</comment>

<comment>Owaisi has no standards at all ! At least the BJP has some standards.</comment>

<comment>I am not a fan of Owaisi but his point is absolutely valid. BJP should stop giving sh!!ty certificates of nationalism and patriotism to ppl of India when it has itself aligned with anti-national PDP in Kashmir!!!!</comment>

<comment>Give a chance even Owaisi, his party and support base would agree with PDP on it...just they don't have the guts to say to publicly..</comment>

<comment>Otherwise how will you deal with Muslim anti-nationals.  Only a person like M.J. Akbar can answer that question.</comment>

<comment>PDP is a party operating under indian constitution whose founder was ex home minister of India. They do not work to break India or shout slogans against India</comment>
