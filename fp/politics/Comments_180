<comment>Modi has not even delivered on a single promise.....he just keeps on touring...all the prices of food have skyrocketed and not a single penny of black money has come back to India...Nitish should win this election...</comment>

<comment>The more recent self goal is what is happening to Dalits in Haryana and the way ministers have been commenting about it</comment>

<comment>Grand alliance = isis.</comment>

<comment>Ground reality is BJP and NDA are winning.</comment>

<comment>BJP is winning.....ha ha ha </comment>

<comment>This article did not state the real reason why the pictures were removed. Because the EC ordered both the grand alliance and NDA to remove all pictures. It had Nothing to with the nonsense mentioned in this article. The ground reality is BJP and NDA is winning big time.</comment>

<comment>Listen Krishna only one reason is sufficient to explain defeat of this Bharat jalao party that is" it claims free from cast but actually it hosts castism inherently , situations have exposed this to young and intellectuals who casted their vote  for  bjp to hoist tri colour gloriously but this bjp wants to hoist saffron colour all over.....people are not so fool...u cheated them once.  Now it is their turn......u home of hate and explorers.</comment>

<comment>Who is clean and who is corrupt how do we know? Every party have corrupt elements in them because many enter politics not because they love their country. It is rather how to mint money while there is sunshine. So One must concentrate on the individual politician rather than the whole party. A good representative, even if he be from the party that we do not like, if elected will serve his constituency well.</comment>

<comment>Let this election be a contest between "Honest Vs Corrupt".Let all corrupt go to jail with out bail.Let Bihar shine.Let brotherhood,love,friendship & harmony develop among people.No hatred,no ill feeling.God is one & we all are children of God.</comment>

<comment>If BJP losses then it's not the loss of Modi or Amit Ji after all they are not going to get any benefit out of it. One will remain PM another will remain President of World's largest party but it will be great loss for Bihar. A huge opportunity came to get Modi Ji's blessings but if BJP losses then it proves Bihar doesn't want it's growth. It wants it's ruin.</comment>

<comment>Opportunity to sell....puls 2000 per kilo????</comment>

<comment>sensing loss in the bihar election, Bihar BJP team removed the photos of modi and shah from their posters.but still if NDA looses modi will be entirely blamed, because he messed it int he first place callingto check the DNA of nitish kumar, from his statement the real defeat of BJP and NDA was in the cardsha ha ha hahaand last week mod also called laluji SHAITAN , this has affected the chances of NDA int he first two phases of electionsand there is no chance now int he remaining 3 phases, because 1 phase is strong hold of Muslims population SEEMACHAL</comment>

<comment>Why did nitish and lalu remove their pictures. The EC ordered both the grand alliance and BJP/NDA to remove pictures. Get your facts right.</comment>

<comment>Brother okkk....but why BJP is doing so???Are they coping nithis and lalu???ha ha ha</comment>

<comment>it can't work and it will never work on such a large scale.lots of people have more then 1 mobile number . there is no unique identification attached to it. it can be easily misused.let the other nations use it first then we can consider using it on us.</comment>

<comment>Mr Jaggi has woken up from slumber, but it is already too late for Bihar. People of India will also wake up in a few months to realize that the jumlas are not going to be a reality anyway. From 31% on to 15%.</comment>

<comment>The mandate in 2014 general elections was for Narendra Modias Prime Minister. More than the opposition parties BJP and associates seem tobe making it tough for Mr.Narendra Modi. eg.Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, Akali Dalin Punjab. To win state elections you have to let a strong local leadershipevolve and take charge. Congress by following the central leadership formulastands decimated only because they did not allow state level leaders to riseand flourish. Narendra Modi and his advisors should have enough confidence inthemselves to let local leadership perform and flourish. The BJP ruled statesof Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Rajasthan have strong chief ministers whohave won on the basis of their performance and not because of any strongcentral leader. Mr.Narendra Modi making himself out to be the central figureeven in state elections will only isolate him even within his own party. Goodtimes do not last forever, and when dark clouds do appear, the question to askis, who will stand by Mr.Narendra Modi even within the BJP??</comment>

<comment>Instead of letting success go to one's head, they must realize that projecting Modi this way is following the same footsteps as following Indira Gandhi. So nothing had changed since that time. When they realize it may be too late. One must not rest all fortunes on a single man. There must be others to carry the good work forward.</comment>

<comment>To capture power, RSS may go to the extent of sacrificing Modi literally on the alter of Muslim terrorism... OMG, Please sav India from RSS and Sangh Parivar evils....</comment>

<comment>Patna administration has already started preparations for the swearing in ceremony of Nitish Kumar as the next CM. There are very very strong talks going on that either Tejaswi or Tej Pratap will become Deputy CM. Most likely Tejaswi, because he is extremely adorable.Intelligent Biharis has finally given more weight to Bihari Pride and inherent secular values of the state.Jai Bihar! Jai Nitish! Jai Tejaswi!</comment>

<comment>There is no way BJP can win Bihar Elections!</comment>

<comment>Bihar election will end the political career of criminal cheat PM NaMo & his deputy Amit Shah as Bihar has always proved to be living laboratory of social engineering and political changes right from MK Gandhi initiation of his political career about a century ago.</comment>

<comment>The fact that Maha-chor-bandhan is still in contention is a reflection of screw ups by fringe elements of BJP and the tongue in mouth statements by RSS. The reality is that instead of talking about beef etc, the country needs to focus back on development. 2015 set the ground work, now 2016 should focus solely on Make In India and economic upliftment of Indians. Other issues will sort out by themselves.</comment>

<comment>99.99% of all terrorists are muslims. And 4 Sunni Muslim Groups Responsible for 66% of All 17,958 Terror Killings in 2013 By Patrick Goodenough | November 19, 2014 | 4:38 AM ESTThe number of people killed by terrorists worldwide in 2013 rose by 60 percent compared to the previous year – from 11,133 to 17,958 – with four Sunni Muslim extremist groups responsible for two-thirds of all fatalities, according to a comprehensive annual study.Eighty-two percent of fatalities occurred in just five countries – Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria, although the number of countries that experienced more than 50 terror-related deaths also rose – to 24, compared with 15 the previous year.The report also found that Islam as a “religion” as a driving ideology for terrorism has jumped significantly in the last five years, and accounts for most of the terror activity in the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.As a driver for terrorist groups, Islam as a religion far outstrips “politics,” which tends to dominate attacks in the Western Hemisphere and is responsible for about half of them in Europe.</comment>

<comment>During last elections in Israel, Left-Centred groups along with their political mentors outside the country and their media counterparts,  tried to create an environment in which they would discourage the core Nationalist voters of Israel to come out and vote. This was their idea of defeating Benjamin Netanyahu. But Netanyahu saw through the conspiracy and appealed directly to the patriotic voters of Israel to come out and vote in large numbers on the day of the voting. And Netanyahu won eventually. Similarly today, a whole bandwagon of lies and misinformation is being preached by certain media groups to discourage NDA voters to come out and vote in the upcoming phases of Bihar election.Some 160 seats are to be polled for elections in Bihar.  Of these 160 seats, in next 3 phases, in some around 120 seats NDA is supposed to do very good. So this is a deliberate  effort to create a feeling of despair, gloom and despondency. But "Bhagvad Geeta" says----"Karmanye Vadhikaraste, Ma Phalesu Kadachana". NDA voters should do their duty and do not think of the results. They should come out and vote heavily on polling day. Bharat Mata ki Jai! "Satyamev Jayate"!</comment>

<comment>Well said</comment>

<comment>Nitish Kumar is playing the politics of dalit appeasement and it seems his party is behind the dalit incident in haryana.... They are unnecessary provoking upper castes because if which there is fallout against dalits .. This dalit appeasement is a conspiracy to defame Modiji. </comment>

<comment>Namaz time for u tho - u and AK sir can face to Islamabad and start ur engine 1...2....3.....go</comment>

<comment>Loudmouths from BJP have publicly challanged AK to demonstrate 50% cut in electricity rate and 700 litre free water. Elected leadership of delhi state did that at the very first instance. Their position on discom have also been endorsed by CAG audit. Does BJP have any iota of shame?</comment>

<comment>The fact is ak49 gave dengue, corruption, rape, murder, and communalism against Hindus.</comment>

<comment>It costed Rs 4,768 crore just this year on power and water subsidy in Delhi. If that money was utilized for something better, you AAPtards would not cry about Rs 200 kg daal!!! Thats roughly 2.3lac tonnes of Daal you idiot!!! Do the math you moron!</comment>

<comment>dude you can cry and complain all you want. Kejriwal has his priorities right.  Do you think a man needs water or dal ? You can bring in right wing economics and wealth redistribution into this argument. But hell if the poor care about trickle down</comment>

<comment>You are "seenically" mad. I am giving it in a way AAPtards understand!! There is no right wing economics... there is only AAPtardian economics on these forums. In reality... its supply and demand.... if supply increases or demand decreases, prices go down or supply decreases or demand increases, prices go up. Its basic Keynesian economics you morons. In this case, the daal prices were precipitated by acute shortage in supply (means no crop output).</comment>

<comment>I am sorry ...you are wasting your breath ...these morons dont understand economics nor do they understand how thw shortage occured .....They have NO brains to understand how the hoarders are functioning and laughing all th e way to their banks .....They just know ONE thing ...no matter what happens anywhere on the planet earth .....it is Narendra Modi's fault ...if BJP is kicked out the entire planet will heave a sigh of relief .....It doesnt matter one iota if India just keeps muttering "sickular" platitudes and remain a rotten third world economy begging for grains every time monsoons fail .....and desh drohis fill their coffers with their loot</comment>

<comment>Khujli.... openly Called Gadkari and Sheela Dikshit Chor.... How many chor he has proved right... forgot about outside.. just talk about inside chors in your own party..</comment>

<comment>ditto for the Vadra and Gandhis man - How many Vadras and Gandhis are in jail - People will say and do anything to get to power. Modi is PM right - Kejju is CM right. What does one lose by making wild accusations in India ?</comment>

<comment>Kejri.. has to compromise with gadkari....  in HR & RJ ongoing inquiry against vadra and PAPPU ka pitara NH ka bhi khul hi raha hai... Swamy Ji chodega nahi</comment>

<comment>"That's three-and-a-half self-goals for the BJP. It needs to change tack fast. Or Nitish Kumar will have the last laugh."People have already made up their minds. Jumlas won't work now</comment>

<comment>Seeing the chronology of Fekuchand, one story comes to my mind -that of a rat and its godfather -a saint.</comment>

<comment>Wherever Fekuchand goes he never tells a lie or any bluff. Check his bhasans and his actions.</comment>

<comment>How many Tathagatas does a comment board need :)</comment>

<comment>Its unfortunate but pathetic reality. One 'Bhakta' loves this nickname and the photos that I use. Twice that dirty creature has copied my photos. This is the third one. Let it keep licking dust of my feet. Although its vulgarity is just despicable. This creature is enjoying the sluggishness of Firstpost.</comment>

<comment>Nitish and Laloo  are blatantly spreading lies about reservation...  and fearing SC ST and DalitsIf you want to lie then then there is no limit unlike sky..Kejriwal did the same in Delhi and now realizing when ground reality is coming to face.</comment>

<comment>Aap kal paida hue the kya ? These are politicans. All politicians lie. And even if they dont outright lie they embellish the truth</comment>

<comment>No... a lie can be about the up down in data or statistics but plain lies are dangerous game to polarize the society</comment>

<comment>its called Election jhumla ...remember black money issue raised by bjp ,i am yet to get my share</comment>

<comment>In MP VYAPAM has been a diasaster; so many scams!! Yet BJP has come to rule them.  That's because it is BJP and therefore, its not Jungle raj.</comment>

<comment>Congress fought on the basis of Vyapam..  here in MP in 2013 and you know they have got 23 seats...People of MP knows better who is real culprits... you aaptards can fool delhiwala but even they have realized..</comment>

<comment>Nitish is not Baba. Different opponents different results</comment>

<comment>Nitish knows everything about BJP.... Fight was never been assumed for single side</comment>

<comment>local channels are saying modi having it easy.............and modi meeting just before elections will hv maximum impact</comment>

<comment>they clearly told reservation wont be changed fr nw........why nitish forgery kumar keep repeating same stuff?......</comment>

<comment>I would like to see how this moron writer looks like when the results are announced....LOL</comment>

<comment>maybe you know something that these people -  who look at surveys day in and out - dont - Do educate us..</comment>

<comment>Check out the most comprehensive survey which was done by ZeeNews.   These are the same people who alone had predicted 68 seats for AAP in Delhi elections....</comment>

<comment>Thankfully there is google. "Zee news predicts Big win for BJP" - news zeenews(dot)india(dot)com/news/delhi/opinion-poll-predicts-big-win-for-bjp-in-delhi_1497094.htmlOnly Chanakya got that one right with Cicero and ABP close.Zee has become a govt mouthpiece. If you want to get the real health of the BJP dont look at these guys.</comment>

<comment>I am talking of the agency which did the survey for ZeeNews.  They predicted correctly for last elections ie Delhi elections.  Chanakya, Cicero or Abp did not have a clue about the Delhi elections....</comment>

<comment>Biharis are most backward stupid ppl..  So I will not be surprised if they don't vote for modiji's development.  </comment>

<comment>with an attitude like that I wonder why people would ever vote for your party. If you dont vote for me you are backward and stupid. I am sure that will play well in an election rally</comment>

<comment>Why would anybody not vote for development and choose jungle raaj unless he is a fool.</comment>

<comment>well no one should. But other considerations are obviously at play here. Caste / Religion play an important role. And considering Mohan Bhagwats statements and the Dadri/Beef incidents - caste and religious votes will get consolidated. That and the fact that slowly people will wake up to the fact that the BJPs development agenda also comes with baggage of cultural change</comment>

<comment>If Bihar doesn't vote for BJP and gives LALU and NITISH the mandate then ...humm.....GOOD LCUK....</comment>

<comment>Then Biharis are fools </comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I am surprised to find you, a new wanderer here. Else you would not have commented like this.</comment>

<comment>jaggi has become a bhakt of late in case you havent noticed.  Modiji can do no wrong for him.</comment>

<comment>i disagree with this analysis.if you look at informal surveys, although they are not highly accurate,   they clearly suggest that the vast majority of the indian people hold that the reservation has outlived its usefulness. even so, the bjp is for reservation, and namo has said so. namo is not the one to violate his words. that's his verifiable history.bjp has spoken much more on nitish's shortcomings than on lalu. jaggi should not go by only what the media choose to report, but also by what's said at the election rallies.  it would be naive of the bjp to do otherwise. and we know bjp is not naive. btw, the infotainment media have reported more on lalu than they have on nitish.yes, there is merit to projecting the cm. but if it leads to internal squabbles it could be a losing proposition. the lesson in dillie is not kejriwal, a nonperformer, but the undeserving outsider kiran bedi who  was projected to be the cm who created a lot of disunity within bjp ranks in nai dilie.  yes,  susheel modi has no such baggage, is the undeclared chief which is well known secret. but perhaps there is a risk to unity at this point. </comment>

<comment>the vast majority of upper caste indian people you mean</comment>

<comment>If Jaggi himself has raised apprehensions and has almost  given up hope on the BJP's chances in Bihar, then things indeed are pretty serious and portend dire consequences for the party at the hustings !!</comment>

<comment>AAPtards can go upto any length to support nitish in his campaign including selling off their mothers and sisters...</comment>

<comment>there are two TG's, who is origina,l who is fake or both are fake?</comment>

<comment>RSS/VHP/BJP dogs think about AAP even in their dreams. So, not surprised that gutter dogs from RSS/VHP/BJP will keep thinking about AAP always</comment>

<comment>AAP does not belive in mothers and sisters. They believe in anti-Modi that is all</comment>

<comment>NITISH + BJP = PEACE AND PROSPERITY. NITISH + LALOO + CONGRESS = DISASTER BRINGING JUNGLE RAJ - 2. THIS FACT MUST BE NOTED BY PEOPLE OF STATE BEFORE VOTING SINCE ALL THREE PARTIES ARE RULING BIHAR SINCE LAST 60 YEARS RESULTED IN ACUTE POVERTY AND BACKWARDNESS ALL OVER STATE.</comment>

<comment>BJP has already made self goals . All allegations and incidents are all against BJP . what can amitshaw do if these organizations create souch problems because of their idiotic comments . Now dalits have been killed in haryana . RSS chiefmohan vagheat started and many incidents have followed since then . Whatever plan amitshaw does will not have any effect if these type of idiots keep on blabbering . Apart from that Congress is doing whatever it can to celebrate communal problems . Can't change the fate of BIP </comment>

<comment>Nitish will have the ladt laugh of course(In the mental asylum for losing it after losing elections)</comment>

<comment>Hmmm... he has got a history of mental breakdown...</comment>

<comment>I think BJP will win Bihar. Even if Nitish laughs, it won't be a self-goal for BJP, it will be the self-goal of the Biharis. Win or lose, BJP should take it in its stride and move on. Most recent -ve issues Beef/Daal/etc are opposition/MSM created (most likely Congress/Church/Arab money working). It is the inexperience of the NDA Govt. that they could neither pinpoint the troublemakers nor fix the dishonest MSM. Hope they learn as they progress.</comment>

<comment>I hope BJP looses every where and we gat bure din back because they were far better than these useless achche din.</comment>

<comment>Yeah right. The days of open loot and scamming. Bloody deshdrohi.</comment>

<comment>Sorry sir... aapke khoon choosne ke din pure huye. Now it's same for all. You lost your AC? Big deal.</comment>

<comment>Prestitutes and AAPtards commenting here want nitish to keep laughing no matter what</comment>

<comment>And you crying.</comment>

<comment>Will modi mention dal in mann ki baat?</comment>

<comment>He will mention the color of your ammi jaan's underwear</comment>

<comment>Now don't reveal your dirty family secrets on a public forum. There are many forums for kinky fetishes online, go there.</comment>

<comment>So you know where you sold you ammi jaan's photos.Wow man, can you send them to me too?</comment>

<comment>I'm honestly not interested in your family matters. You are also getting repetitive. That's a sign of low IQ and attention disorder. It's a common symptom for Bakhts. The good news is there are many more Bakhts like you. But unlike you, they don't discuss their kinks on a political forum. But hey, each one for his own. I symphatise. The symptoms are known to get worse a few weeks before an election defeat.</comment>

<comment>Bakht is a surname...don't know why you are dragging them here.</comment>

<comment>Cut the cr@p and apply burnol, you will need it more than anyone else</comment>

<comment>as to face the total elimination from bihar similar to delhi which is why he pm Modi  has withdrawn himself from the bihar scenario.HIS other constituents are busy in vandalism elsewhere and recent happenBJP hing in Haryana pushes BJP to lower steps.It seems that the other BJP  CMs are not behaving responsibly in their states..This will certainly back fire in bihar' BJP</comment>

<comment>I never said that-I am saying the facts,dont u think the APMC act favours middlemen?</comment>

<comment>APMC has its disadvantages but to make changes it needs a procedural time frame , anyways don't you think the deliberate 'outraged' atmosphere being painted by media + caste politics are the real competition to counter for BJP in Bihar ?</comment>

<comment>When the Congress is in power, the BJP attributes the price rise of any commodity due to the wrong policies of the Central Government, but this blame game  tune conveniently changes when it comes to power and it passes on the buck at the door step of the State Governments.  In the Bihar election campaign, taking advantage of  peoples ignorance,  the BJP is blaming the State Government for the rise in Dal prices when the fact is that it is an all India phenomenon and not restricted merely to the State of Bihar which exposes the spurious claim of the party  !!The nagging question remains as to who prevented this Government from foreseeing the Dal crisis and take preemptive action by raising up supplies against perked up demand ?The whole supply chain distribution  system is now caught in the mire of speculative online trading of commodities and hoarding by Giant retailers who are distorting the prices at the retail level with the Government being accommodative and acting in tandem by being a willing accomplice of their cartelisation, hoarding and  economic  exploitation of the masses which is the most  ugly manifestation   of economic terrorism    !!</comment>

<comment>Food inflation is at its minimum at around 3 % currently compared to 14 % during black days of congress...But only one singular issue of 'Pulses/Dal' prices is being highlighted to eclipse the overall achievements of BJP on this front..The prices of Dal have skyrocketed not due to policies of central govt. but they're a result of combined factors as -1> Record  low rainfall in last year or so..2> Inability of state govts. to crack down hoarders..3> The gradual stagnation of pulses production through the years , as the population growth has overtaken the supply...</comment>

<comment>All the poor dogs / mango people of India: Lo and Behold! India is shining! Modi is shining! See all the photos of phoren peoples with Modi! Don't bloody complain that Dal is Rs. 200/= a kg.

<comment>Daily Mail Bureau | Mangaluru | Oct 18, 2015::  The probe into the murder of a Bajrang Dal activist in Moodbidri town of coastal Karnataka has taken an interesting turn.A local BJP leader has claimed that witnesses in the case are receiving threat calls from international mobile numbers, asking them not to testify in the case.To make matters worse for the police, the prime witness allegedly committed suicide two days ago.The murder has also taken a political angle with the BJP — which is strong in the coastal Karnataka region — alleging that the Congress government was deliberately not according importance to the incident.“It is evident that everyone is trying to hush up the case. The Congress politicians are not showing any interest in ensuring justice to the victim’s family.“Had the police shown concern, they would have arrested the culprits by now.“We are hearing that other witnesses are being threatened over phone from international mobile numbers, including Pakistani phone numbers,” said Dakshina Kannada MP (BJP) Nalin Kumar Kateel.On October 9, Prashanth Poojary (26), an active Bajrang Dal member and a flower vendor, was hacked to death by six unidentified bike-borne miscreants in Mudbidri.He had recently actively taken part in busting illegal slaughter houses and protested against cattle trafficking in the region.On October 15, prime witness Vaman Poojary (68) allegedly committed suicide at his daughter’s home.While the police claimed that he ended his life due to personal reasons, others are linking it to Prashanth’s murder.“Vaman Poojary had clearly seen the faces of the assailants who attacked Prashanth. He could have helped us in identifying the miscreants.“Unfortunately, he is no more and this has been a big blow to the probe. Nevertheless, we are confident of nabbing the killers,” a Dakshina Kannada district police officer said.The cops believe that all the six assailants have fled to Kerala. Prashanth’s cousin Dhyanesh alleged: “We have shared information about the suspects with the police.Read also: Accused in Prashanth Poojary’s murder believed to be nabbed by police“It is already a week, but we are not seeing any progress in the probe,” he said.Kateel also alleged that police already have information about the suspects, but were delaying the probe.“After Prashanth had busted the illegal slaughter house with his friends, a protest demonstration was held by a group in Moodbidri.“Addressing the protesters, their leader Haneef had vowed to take revenge against all those involved in the raid on the slaughter house.“Prashanth was killed at the same spot where the speech was made, but action has not been taken against Haneef so far.“The police should have arrested and questioned him,” the BJP leader said.Courtesy: Daily mail and the links used above.***</comment>

<comment>During last elections in Israel, Left-Centred groups along with their political mentors outside the country and their media counterparts,  tried to create an environment in which they would discourage the core Nationalist voters of Israel to come out and vote. This was their idea of defeating Benjamin Netanyahu. But Netanyahu saw through the conspiracy and appealed directly to the patriotic voters of Israel to come out and vote in large numbers on the day of the voting. And Netanyahu won eventually. Similarly today, a whole bandwagon of lies and misinformation is being preached by certain media groups to discourage NDA voters to come out and vote in the upcoming phases of Bihar election.Some 160 seats are to be polled for elections in Bihar.  Of these 160 seats, in next 3 phases, in some around 120 seats NDA is supposed to do very good. So this is a deliberate  effort to create a feeling of despair, gloom and despondency. But "Bhagvad Geeta" says----"Karmanye Vadhikaraste, Ma Phalesu Kadachana". NDA voters should do their duty and do not think of the results. They should come out and vote heavily on polling day. Bharat Mata ki Jai! "Satyamev Jayate"!</comment>

<comment>Awwww... poor ISIS sodomite , i can feel ya pain lolLMAO... ISIS toilet cleaner using internet in his spare time ! i pity you buddy ,it must be real nasty rubbing off dirty shit stains from the toilet bowls in ISIS camps...considering the krap they eat...lmao</comment>

<comment>BJpigs spotted</comment>

<comment>BUT SERIOUSLY , Hey ISIS-sodomite , How do you survive in that Pi55-dripped stench of Burqa ??</comment>

<comment>Agreed dude.. media propaganda is to make BJP lose, if BJP wins there is no news, if at all they lose.. sale next 5 saal tak bihar election gayenge and High TRP as a result.. i believe people will vote for BJP overwhelmingly,they only thing voter will ask himself while voting do i want Lalu at the helm.. and that is where all will change...</comment>

<comment>but lalu is not at the helm, nitish is</comment>

<comment>Check the vote share RJD got in the lok sabha elections 2014, it was more than JDU.. Nitish needs Lalu more than Lalu needs him. if this alliance wins, it will be lalu who will have a major say in the governance</comment>

<comment>If RJD wins more seats that JD(U) your theory might have some credibility. I don't think that's going to happen.</comment>

<comment>Nitish can not come and stay in power without Lalu.It is Nitish who needs Lalu more than ever after election.RJD is not BJP to let Nitish do his work,</comment>

<comment>Keep dreaming that.. keep dreaming..</comment>

<comment>What's your typing speed?</comment>

<comment>What is the colour of your beard , brown isnt it ?</comment>

<comment>All the readers here targeting BJP and supporting RJD+CONGRESS+JDU.....are the same bunch who advocate missionary+madarssa propaganda in general..And would even go to the extent of supporting AIMIM if it was the main political opposition to BJP..</comment>

<comment>Modi ji has done India Proud globally. Earlier Indians were ashamed to call themselves Indians but now with Modiji we are proud Bhartis. Our culture of burning dalit kids, slaughtering innocents accusing them of eating beef, throwing ink on foreign dignitaries has made the world aware of our true Sanskriti. What Congress could not achieve in the last 60 years Modiji achieved in less than 2 year. Har Har Modi aur Har ek Ghar Modi.</comment>

<comment>If Modi doesnt build Ram Temple he should say BYE Bye to his second term.Useless statues being build wont guarantee him votes.</comment>

<comment>Jaggiji - And you easily forget  the biggest self-goal of all is Feku sermonizing  about the virtues of communal harmony !!</comment>

<comment>Modiji ne mast chewtiya banaaya poore india ko. yeh toh maan na padega... nobody is as intelligent as modiji</comment>

<comment>pappu and you are the most intelligent people in this country</comment>

<comment>kal election karwa le toh bhi modi jitega...congress ne kiya kya hai apni haar k baad, wohi purana communal raag...nothing to recover from their loss</comment>

<comment>bina kuchh kiye congress jitegi, by default... the 69% who didnt vote for modiji will all unite to keep him out... modiji kuchh kaam to kar nahi rahe, lekin kaam hota dikhaane ke liye publicity pe itne paise kharch kar rahe hain ki record ban gaya.... oopar se dange fasaadiyon ko alag chhoot de rakhi hai</comment>

<comment>hmm..magar kya pseudo secular chahte hain ki kaam ho? last parliament session resulted in nothing...tu kah raha hai dange fassadiyon ko chhoot de rakkhi hai modi ne, mera sawaal yeh hai ki agar use PM ki power use karni hai toh bahut se tareeke hain muslim ko maarne ke beena media mein laaye, right? agar iss sab se kisi ko faayda ho raha hai toh woh yeh pseudo seculars he hain..modi ko toh nuksaan ho raha hai iss sab se, woh kyu karega? aur agar karna he hai toh i don't think a person as a PM will use such stupid way for his agendas...</comment>

<comment>Agar modi sahi me chahata KI parliament chale toh woh vasundhara raje aur Sushma swaraj ke against action leta...sirf drama karna hai usko</comment>

<comment>agar aise action hone lag jaaye toh mai yakeen k saath kah sakta hoon ki sirf BJP nahin, kisi bhi political party ki sarkar chalegi he nahin...BTW pichley 10 Saal mein UPA ne kitno k khilaaf action liya tha? do they have any morality to demand for action OR was just using it as an excuse to stall the parliament?</comment>

<comment>Oh really? Aap ka matalab hai, aapake congress ke 60 saal ke kal me sab intellegent the?</comment>

<comment>kahaan se kahaan pahuch gaya desh 60 saal me, tumko kya maalum. Poochhna kabhi us generation ke logo se kya haalat thi tab desh ki</comment>

<comment>Congress and Britishers are no different, they both minted public money and filled up their coffers. Intelligent Indians know who is looting the country, that's why they were reduced to 44 and I am confident on Rahul Gandhi who is helping the cause of congress mukt bharat</comment>

<comment>mai baap log bahut develop kiya 60 saal me. isiliye janta ne cong ko bitha diya is election me. ab aur 2019 tak intejaar kijiye</comment>

<comment>Poochha to tha... Kahte the ki Angrez the to sab better tha. Why, poochh lo aaj bhi un se...</comment>

<comment>oh haan i forgot RSS waalon ko dard hua tha when angrez rule ended... they didnt even participate in freedom struggle because they supported british rule and were getting monthly allowances from them.</comment>

<comment>Vo puri generation RSS ki thi kya... baaki congress ne alien pakad laye, hmm?</comment>

<comment>poori generation nahi, bas abhi joh sanghi hain unke dada nana.. tumhare dada, nana bhi sanghi hi rahe honge ?</comment>

<comment>ha ha.. tu khud hi kyo nahi ban jaata :)</comment>

<comment>LMAO...exactly why you're a BJP 'HATER'...</comment>

<comment>Two Gujjus were the face of BJP's poll campaign in Bihar till the second phase. How absurd is that? Now they've put in 5-6 Biharis, but it's too late</comment>

<comment>Gujju or Bihari, Indian tho hai. Not Italian or british.who is too late and who is too early, we will know on 7th Nov</comment>

<comment>These 2 Gujjus ruined the hopes of Gunda S.P and Corrupt Behen Mayawati in U.P..yaad hain ki bhool Gaya :DBihar Needs BJP or else will go 100 years back!</comment>

<comment>Modi would have won the election if it held in america.</comment>

<comment>Just like he had won the LS election if it happened on twitter... :D</comment>

<comment>Modi has more support in Madison Square, New York than Motihari, Bihar. Discuss. (10 marks question)</comment>

<comment>Modiji is only answerable to NRIs, so only their support matters. burnol movement to aaptards</comment>

<comment>even in madison square he gets all rented gujjus .</comment>

<comment>vividly exposed by Rajdeep in his conversations with them.</comment>

<comment>Flag March in Ludhiana !!</comment>

<comment>Man, I wanna join AAP cyber team like you. Please Kejri se meri baat chala na? Kitana deta hai woh ek comment ka? 10 paise ki 15 paise?</comment>

<comment>For each paise he gives one gaali too... so think it over.</comment>

<comment>no cheap labour required please.</comment>

<comment>Oh you mean you get paid bomb from Kejri????</comment>

<comment>BJP is the only solution no other party has a stand on good governance,All opposition and pseudo seculars seems to have their hand full dirty</comment>

<comment>Good governance was a nice jumla... masterstroke by modiji...fooled everyone</comment>

<comment>Guys do u trust laloo and congress, u know wht they did to nation and bihar</comment>

<comment>agar chhote thhag (fraud) aur bade thhag me choose karna ho, we will choose chhota thhag like laalu... Modiji is a very big level thhag. Laalu chara khaaya, modiji desh khaa jayenge aur dakaar bhi nahi lenge</comment>

<comment>MODI has done good work, and is continuing good work we need to support him, tell me one PM who worked for 20 hours a day.Do not get swayed away by caste thugs and pseudo seculars,It is time for unity in favor of strong bihar and nation.Lallo and others have their family business in politics MODI has no intention but to work for India</comment>

<comment>yes, they have a very good stand on governance in Bihar.</comment>

<comment>BJP has a good record on that count in Bihar.</comment>

<comment>It's fun to make fun of these guys, isn't it?</comment>

<comment>:)</comment>

<comment>is there any way to check their IQ?</comment>

<comment>No, but you can make a safe assumption. It is uniformly low</comment>

<comment>Dal at Rs200 is hardly the stuff good governance is made off</comment>

<comment>this is nt wht government has done this is work of black marketers,India and bihar will on right path only when BJP remian in power quote me any place where these psudo seculars like congress and lallo have done work, BJP is a nationalist party , other parties have their interest to survive</comment>

<comment>when was the last time you got your head MRI done ?</comment>

<comment>Neither Lallo or congress is going to take u anywhere,the worst will happen to people and nation if other parties come in power did u see congress rule for 65 and lallo rule for 25 years.Now you know who need MRI</comment>

<comment>about it, please ask Dr. Togadia or Dr. Sambit Patra.</comment>

<comment>Not a  Castiest  !!!But if you look at the social media support bjp gets ..its only from the High caste spammers .whereas in kejriwals case he gets it from everyone from a dalit to a obc to high caste . .Modi is just a puppet of R$$</comment>

<comment>Dude, I wanna join AAP cyber team like you. Please Kejri se meri baat chala na? Kitana deta hai woh ek comment ka? 10 paise ki 15 paise?</comment>

<comment>Well, if you want to join the team you will have to learn how to type. No payment is made for copy-pasting alas</comment>

<comment>Oh really? So how much you get for commenting on comments? 2 paise or 5 paise?</comment>

<comment>1 rupee</comment>

<comment>Wowww...to meri baat chalao yar Kejri se! Main bhi accha comment kar leta hu.</comment>

<comment>Have to charge more, can't afford dal</comment>

<comment>:)</comment>

<comment>Self Goal no. 2 is correct. Modi face should not remain the only criterion but even local heroes should be projected as equal partner in his efforts for development. Modi lost so badly in Delhi, he must restrategize</comment>

<comment>It is not just about communication - the BJP does have some very effective communicators and an excellent PR machine. It's the nature of the beast, and it's supporters - the way they attack and denigrate their opponents leading to loss of credibility, a superior know it all attitude that prevails all around that has shades of casteism, and an overreliance on Modi's PR machine. That can only last for so long before things catch up to you.</comment>

<comment>Very good point. BJP (or Bharat Jalao Party as Mr Paswan referred to it in 2013), is constructing a mega-Pakistan within India.</comment>

<comment>Delhi dismantled every myth.</comment>

<comment>By murdering people with dengue and giving woes galore to the rest</comment>

<comment>Said like a true 'Hater'..... naturally spewing misleading picture without any backing of factual context..</comment>

<comment>you said it exactly right. Same thing happened during Atal ji's time. BJP was going all over with their 'India shining' PR mumbo-jumbo with nothing to match on ground for people to see clearly,,,.and denigrating anyone asking genuine questions... the rest is history as for 10 years bjp was pushed to the sideline</comment>

<comment>If you still have brains in your skull you will realise that India had one of the best president during that time, won a war and tested its first nuke</comment>

<comment>That's elegantly put.</comment>

<comment>Offcourse you would come into his defence as you're part of the same team , your comments itself are testimony of your political inclinations ..So...it isnt surprising you would echo the veracity of his false claims..</comment>

<comment>i am just pointing out to how your comment proves he is right... in the last 1.5 years of modiji's goivt, i haven't seen one guy who criticised any aspect of modi govt and wasn't labelled a sickular/antinational/anti-india/ etc etc by either BJP spokespersons or the online modiji's spokespersons like you.... Not one person..... you guys didnt even spare arun shourie</comment>

<comment>And not one guy who was not kicked out by khujliwal and AAPtards for even raising a finger at maulana kejruddin</comment>

<comment>So what else do you expect ?Mocking a one year old government for not delivering the promises requiring minimum of 5 years and even at the cost of openly supporting absolute disgusting falsehoods spread by political and media detractors... !</comment>

<comment>ROFLMAO.....'Madarssa-army' here on FP are flustered by the fact that others can type and contribute something worth on FP than the usual repulsive gunk they plaster all over here... LMAORetards ,your low IQ and incapacity to argue doesnt redounds over others... lol</comment>

<comment>Stone-ji, please stop rolling and laughing. And please try and keep all your parts together.I looked at your other posts after what you said, and you have so far not offered any substantive proof of your higher IQ here. Perhaps it's hidden somewhere in there, or perhaps it flew away in your last round of laughing.</comment>

<comment>HA HA....  well above  comment of yours was the perfect illustration of what i alluded to in my original  comment.....You guys are only capable of making arse-dumb comments , such as highlighting how one should laugh and roll or hide emotions ...</comment>

<comment>What did you allude to in your original comment? I don't even understand what you are laughing and feeling so good about.</comment>

<comment>Hop off...if you want to argue on something substantial , then come forward else move it..</comment>

<comment>You haven't said anything substantial - don't pretend like you have. And then follow it up with some rant about how everyone lacks IQ.Are you guys for real? Don't you get clubbed at school/work with such analysis?</comment>

<comment>I just wanted to know your typing speed. It's pretty impressive ;)</comment>

<comment>Maybe coz i am from the profession where it  has to be a prerequisite ..</comment>

<comment>he uses his hands legs and d*ck to type all at once ,</comment>

<comment>Someone said that Amit shahs IQ is less than that of a donkey Is that true ?</comment>

<comment>please remember he is the President of the ruling party. his IQ is second highest in his party.</comment>

<comment>going by that logic smiriti iranic hs a higher Iq than you do</comment>

<comment>I am no bhakt so my IQ has to be very low. no question about it.</comment>

<comment>The most vital weapon in the armory of any leadership is the ‘Art of communication’ and BJP are the worst in that criteria….Here is the scenario , where Media is openly painting a massively-exaggerated spectre of ‘outrage’ and ‘intolerance’ in the nation , with single objective to impede the functioning of BJP even at the cost of thwarting India’s progress in the net effect…This is shut and open treachery by Media ..But the more disheartening aspect is the BJP’s inefficiency to counter this fictional ‘turbulence’ invented by Media and enabling the common masses to get aware of the same.The only group which is being downright ‘Bigot’ and ‘Intolerant’ is the IIM (Islamify India Mission ) aka Nehruvian gang , as they’re not able to digest the fact , that long asleep and brain-paralysed infidels have seen through the diabolical design of the graduates from IIM and therefore have started to show a retributive stance in terms of public discourse…..</comment>

<comment>What's your typing speed?</comment>

<comment>hes just the copy paste guy ..someone else types this shit !! his job is to paste it here .. follow other links in FP and ull find same posts everywhere lol</comment>

<comment>they should ban copy-paste in FP</comment>

<comment>do you get for the total words you type or is it a daily wage ?</comment>

<comment>Illiterate madarssa-kunttt , stay away you filth..</comment>

<comment>do you get extra for typing filth ? Like some Bonus ?</comment>

<comment>Modi! Modi! Modi!</comment>

<comment>You mean the third one is Lalit?</comment>

<comment>Jaggi thinks by projecting Sushil Modi, BJP would have won. But Biharis hate baniyas because of their old history of keeping the poor financially enslaved using their lending powers. Naming Sushil Modi as CM candidate would have backfired</comment>

<comment>Whom do Biharis vote for? BJP has no State leadership in Bihar.</comment>

<comment>we have many state leaders in bihar not just one. we have a problem of plenty</comment>

<comment>and Baniyas love kejriwal</comment>

<comment>Baniyas love modiji... Ask any baniya and they will swear by modiji.</comment>

<comment>you are typing to a banya lol</comment>

<comment>you must be from the updravi gotra..they r an exception</comment>

<comment>LOL</comment>

<comment>power has gotten into modis and amit shahs head ..they think running country is like playing some sorta game .. Idiots will pay price in 2019 .</comment>

<comment>Trying to change a country's ethos and values just because you've won 33% votes is a very foolish idea. It has to backfire. It is good that Jaggi is waking up to the perils of Hindutva.</comment>

<comment>After the Bihar loss . Modi is all set to Lose bengal tamil nadu , punjab .people will start calling him  NIRMAL BABA OF POLITICS if he fails to deliver on his promises</comment>

<comment>No double about Bengal and TN. How would you say that Badal (Mandela) will lose?</comment>

<comment>Mandela! lol!</comment>

<comment>Aap should do good in punjab .</comment>

<comment>AAP can only do pishAAP in punjab</comment>

<comment>shhh. you do not know AAP is responsible for all the maladies, the country is facing.</comment>

<comment>Apply burnol darling</comment>

<comment>Me too believe so. I was just kidding Badal Mandela ji.</comment>

<comment>i knw :)</comment>

<comment>Daal ke dal dal main phans gaye apne hi karma se. Are they bechaare?</comment>

<comment>I honestly feel sorry for Feku now Afterall the drama yet another defeat !!!</comment>

<comment>He might spend most of the remaining 3.5 years abroad</comment>

<comment>Me too. May be in next election, Modi ji should allow his NRI audiences to vote here.</comment>

<comment>Nris are allowed to vote this time ! but gujjus cant caste vote in bihar uknow ,,</comment>

<comment>Jaggu loves Owaisi ... lol...duffer, owaisi is contesting only 6 seats,..., laloo's beef comment worked for BJP, ....but if BJP falls short of the 122 mark, then it's Mohan Bhagwat & only Mohan Bhagwat to blame...The cunning RSS chief has got his timing right & the damage to BJP's chances has been done.......BJP's only chance of damage-control is that Modi directly refutes Bhagwat & tells him to mind his own business & talk to the people straight from an election platform & announce that there is no RSS-activism like the unconstitutional Sonia's NAC that can dare interfere & legislate for the GOI, with this one stone he can kill a 'flock of birds'.</comment>

<comment>If Modi 'directly refutes Bhagwat', either the BJP or RSS or both will collapse.</comment>

<comment>even amongst RSS cadres, it's Modi who is supreme...so Bhagwat will collapse & replaced with a 'friendlier' RSS Chief. & Bihar will be swept again by BJP. It's a risk worth taking for Modi, it shall also shut-up the Modi-bashing brigade...</comment>

<comment>I will have to see that to believe it. I'm not saying you are necessarily wrong, but it is hard to imagine at the moment.</comment>

<comment>It's an opportune time for Modi, that's if he really want the Govt. focus to be devlp. & only devlp. AJ, has actually said this already in a nuanced manner in his interview with Arnab yesterday,  when Arnab questioned him on Som & gang (AJ: Some elements think that they can create a constituency for themselves with such comments &The BJP Prez (AS) has already conveyed the party stand to them, I also wish to believe that the party spokespersons are conducting themselves properly) lol....I bet neither Arnab nor the Rajnath appointed spokepersons, Patra & co, must've got this veiled warning..</comment>

<comment>I want to open a anti-brainwashing clinic in Bihar. Very much required as hero of Bihar is SOCIALIST Ram Manohar Lohia. He needs to be urgently thrown into "dustbin of history"[a catch phrase of leftists]. Socialism is legal robbery as distinct from charity.Adam Smith, the father of economics, says in economics ManProposes and God Disposes. If every body in a nation become do-gooders -- Goddisposes -- and we will have hell on earth. if man proposes to be selfish --God again disposes -- and we will have prosperity and peace.Giving rational explanation of God, the elder do-gooders , MK Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Ambedkar etc forgot that a strong socialist state is required to do good. And it will demand its pound of flesh closest to the heart – rampant corruption. A strong state emerges in an environment of shortages – to distribute scant resources. Any socialist state will NOT destroy the reason for its existence.24 hour water supply will reduce water required to be released by 30%. NoGovernment Engineer in India will accept this. Scarcity, distress is requiredfor the reason for its existence. If no scarcity exists it will manufacture it.Mysore had water scarcity even though it had KRS dam beside it. It is aquestion of power. A society can either have equality or freedombut never both. Why? To enforce equality a strong and intrusive state isrequired. Stateism is against Individualism and kills freedom.</comment>

<comment>Its amazing that bhaktas use the words 'nationalist', 'patriotism', 'hindutva' so commonly that we get confused. Who is more 'Hindu'? Uddhav Thangardey or Modi or Sharad Pawer?</comment>

<comment>well.. i will quote one article before.. dont count your chicken before hatching..1.irresponsible media: media's favourite man seem to be sakshi maharaj, everyday something happens in india and media has hired one guy specially for sakshi maharaaj, in search of masala instead of substance.2.before general elections too.. media and siculars did not leave any stone unturned to spread rumours about modi too..i am not surprised if they are doing that again.. they are bound to fail.3.even if BJP loses bihar .. may be it will grow may be it will not,Bihari janta is bound to have lalu at helm and that makes me sad for so many bihari's.hope bihari janta understands it and votes sensibly.</comment>

<comment>One remark on your comment. You forgot to mention that you are a "Blind Bhakt".</comment>

<comment>Opps.. i though that was understood.. anyways for your sake i'm.at least i have chosen a side.. are u still confused which side ur on??let me give u options..1.Corrupt/Looteri/Communal(read Anti Hindu) congress2.Sri Arvind Kejriwal+Nitish+Lalu+Congress3.AIMIM/Muslim League/SPor are u gonna float your own party???boy grow up..</comment>

<comment>One remark on your comment.  You forgot to mention that you are a "Sickular P1mp".</comment>

<comment>Nitish performed in Bihar with BJP support and the big question is with 100 seats each with Nitish and Lalu, even if JDU wins 100 seats he will be at the mercy of Lalu ... no analysis but plain facts that every Bihari like me is aware of ... irrespective of blog posts and media talk shows!</comment>

<comment>Biharis have suffered inexplicably impoverished living conditions in their state and the situation is getting worse by minute. Added with RjD's presence as the bigger player over JdU is a recipe for irrecoverable disaster.For almost 4 decades local inhabitants have tested the delivery of these 'Sekoolar' type casteist baboons....  but now if Biharis really want to shed the tag of ' burden on India'  then they need to wipe out these so called sekoolar-socialist parasites from their state......</comment>

<comment>Stone ji, who are you campaigning for? and who will be the CM of Bihar? Narendra Modi? Lalit Modi? or Sushil Modi?</comment>

<comment>its going to be Tom MOODY provided he converts to hinduism .</comment>

<comment>Ha ha ha ha</comment>

<comment>BJP bhakts logic '' dont qustion the goverment question the people who question the goverment"....Lol</comment>

<comment>Modi has not even delivered on a single promise.....he just keeps on touring...all the prices of food have skyrocketed and not a single penny of black money has come back to India...Nitish should win this election</comment>

<comment>Oh, black money? BJP never promised it.</comment>

<comment>Goonda Amitji is pretty clear that it is a poll jumla !!</comment>

<comment>Exactly. Even Ache din also was not promised by them. It's a congress conspiracy.</comment>

<comment>LoL !!</comment>

<comment>Around the World in 365 days with just exceptions during election season !!</comment>

<comment>So within one year of Modi, how much is the growth percentage of Adani, nationally and internationally? How much is growth percentage of common Indians like us?</comment>

<comment>Quite high for me. Sorry if you did not experience it.</comment>

<comment>Nice as usual, Jaggi. But you get the government you deserve. If Bihar deserves development, none of the negatives will detract. If they deserve swill, that's what they will get in a pig sty. Biharis are bright and know the difference.</comment>

<comment>Modi ji's international tours didn't investments to India. At least, will it bring "Dal" to India?</comment>

<comment>well said bro</comment>

<comment>I guess his craze of foriegn visits, immediately after getting the throne, could be a symptom of inferiority complex. His attempt to sideline/marginalise LKA and others could be due to the same if not anxiety or insecurity. Or, should there be some similarity with Aurangzeb?</comment>

<comment>Simple, it's like buy one get one free. If Modi ji completes campaign of one election, he will he given one foreign tour free.</comment>

<comment>will be the fastest century maker.</comment>

<comment>Janata Dal couldn't bury BJP. May be the Dal which really matters at the kitchen would do the unfinished job !!</comment>

<comment>Ha ha ha</comment>

<comment>After losing bihar election, BJP will say it is not modi'sfailure. I bet they wont admit loss. They call media prestittute for reportingthe news.</comment>

<comment>modiji is the only hindu godfather, a hindu hriday samraatwe all know him because of his courageous acts of 2002</comment>

<comment>Read a nice comment below which I think must be shared with all Hindus.:Modiji should stop appeasing sickulars now by talking about development and openly declare dharmyuddha, only then will hindus understand the gravity of the situation...otherwise we are doomed. :(</comment>

<comment>Modi has not even delivered on a single promise.....he just keeps on touring...all the prices of food have skyrocketed and not a single penny of black money has come back to India...Nitish should win this election</comment>

<comment>U keep waiting for the black money..we r not interested. </comment>

<comment>You are  a millionaire who is not interested. But there are paupers who are really interested and are eager that Feku fulfills his poll promise which has now been rechristened as mere jumla !!</comment>

<comment>Ha ha ha. Are you admitting that Modi ji is doing appeasement politics just for the sake of winning elections?</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately yes but he knows that he must act now otherwise his fate will be same as Atal bihari who cheated Hindus.</comment>

<comment>What you really want him to do on the Hindutva front  ? Please be more vocal  !!</comment>

<comment>He should start with ram mandir...</comment>

<comment>So, construction of Ram mandir will ensure that milk and honey flows in this country freely in the streets rather than slush, filth  and sewage that are adorning our surroundings now  !?Even if Feku wishes, he cannot construct Ram Mandir  because the issue is entangled in Courts. Forget about it.  BJP is cheating you guys incorporating it in their manifesto and as long as the RSS and BJP are making it a political issue, there can be no scope for a negotiated settlement on this vexed issue !!</comment>

<comment>What is there to negotiate. It is birthplace or ram.. So temple should be there</comment>
