<comment>The BJP HAD a good chance in Assam, but the daily shows of absolute incompetence, unmitigated bigotry and peak stupidity from Modi down to the ABVP activists has spoilt it for them.</comment>

<comment>Now modi willl bcos of 60 yrs of Congress rule we are seeing fire in India </comment>

<comment>BJP should be given chance in ASSAM. 3 years of CONGRESS rule is enough. Change is required.</comment>

<comment>BJP has high chances of forming gov in assam... My guess is that they are going to have 25% vote (40 MLAs) in West Bengal and atleast 20% votes or 25 MLAs in Kerala..It may get 15 MLAs in Tamil Nadu with 7-8% votes...No idea about Puducherry</comment>

<comment>Like ktk gave a chance and we know what happened thr</comment>

<comment>Yes where was the humanity of BJP and modi from 1992 Babri 1993 mumbai riots 2002 godhra now dadri then calling Dalits as dogs now this year rohit vemula So BJP low level scums have no rights to speak on humanity </comment>

<comment>Where was the humanity of the thug called babar when he destroyed the temple of Ram?</comment>

<comment>Hey dog, I can cite numerous example where innocent Hindus killed by Muzzie pigs...do you know 369 (officially) temples destroyed in Kashmir IN 1992? Thousands of Kashmiri pundits butchered? in Bombay blast, 95% killed were Hindus? in Godhra, 58 Hindus (including women and children) burnt to death? who called dalits dogs??? you twisted the tweet of Gen VK singh??? you remember dadri but not maldah, agra (gaurav killed by muzzies as his cracker entered a muslim house), kerala, magalore, pune (dalit burnt to death by muzzies)??do you know 5 dalits killed by muzzies in west Bengal in may 2015  at juranpur, west Bengal?don't mess with me...kacchha chittha khol dunga</comment>

<comment>All stories </comment>

<comment>you are a cyber bot...so planting stories about dadri (actually a family feud), rohith (committed suicide as he ran out of funds and his career had no clue and he was used by ASA, AISA), Mumbai riots started by muzzie underworld dons (30% Hindus killed by muslims and muslims killed after Hindus retaliated)..I told you, don't debate with me...I have facts in my command..No fake upvotes of Praveen kumar will help you</comment>

<comment>Saala  global godhra dum dabaa ke bhaag Gaya.These lefties and muzzies can be silenced with facts.Bludgeon them with facts and zap them out of their wits.By the way,every muzzie or leftie is heartless,devoid of natural human emotions.That makes them you know what !!!</comment>

<comment>Make in India becomes Flame in India</comment>

<comment>Modi Bhakt says....Has an edge but still needs AGP............ Ahole</comment>

<comment>Delivering hate speeches will promote terrorism in North -East! People must vote for Unity and Stability!  Wicked Caste and religious intolerance will not make India a strong nation! Ban the communal parties to save India! Two party or three! Why 101 Political parties? Hell no! Do good and fight the evil forces! One India!</comment>

<comment>i certainly hope this time tarun gogoi will lose handsomely whatever be his strategy as i feel people mostly are fed up with his style of functioining and in particular majority are fed up with congress.</comment>

<comment>assam se bangla katmulle ghuspetiyon ko maar bhagao</comment>

<comment>Bjp will win assam nd dtz fr sure</comment>

<comment>Please remember Himanta Bishwa Sharma factor. He was the main architect of Congress party's successive win in Assam and the only minister who performed constantly, but Tarun Gogoi ditched him in to secure his son Gaurav Gogoi's future. This guy now is with BJP and already stitched a formidable alliance with the Bodoland Peoples Front. If BJP loses from here it will be quite shocking.</comment>

<comment>True </comment>

<comment>BJP has to win to defeat antinational Congis and Commies.</comment>

<comment>BJP has the edge in Assam, but now it seems to be worried whether or not Modi effect is still a major factor. But I will be surprised if BJP loses. if BJP does lose in Assam, all of us can say with certainly Modi effect has now vanished.</comment>

<comment>FP was posting similar article on Bihar Elections !</comment>

<comment>Once again Nationalistic Party is going to be on its winning Streak Assam , HP , UK sure shot success in these states</comment>

<comment>HP elections are far away as of now, but it is difficult situation for BJP. The HP BJP is faction ridden. Shanta Kumar, Prem Kumar ( and his son ) and Now J P Nadda are eyeing CM ship and their supporters are not united. Moreover, before HP, Punjab will go for polls, depending on how AAP fairs in Punjab, it will have huge impact on HP. There are high chances that after Punjab, AAP will try its luck in HP.</comment>

<comment>Although author is correct that it is only Assam where BJP seems to have some hope to be able to form a government She is wrong when she says ""There is little hope of winning West Bengal, even less Tamil Nadu, Kerala or Puducherry". It is true that BJP will not be making government in these states, but Alliance of AINRC+BJP in Puducherry is also a front runner. In Kerala, there is high chance that BJP wins some seat and after elections the realignment of various small parties in UDF and LDF happens. From BJP perspective, it would be a "win".</comment>

<comment>bjp have strng chances in w.b nd in kerala tamilnadu it can b runnerup</comment>

<comment>I think it is just your wishful thinking when you say that BJP has strong chance in WB and Kerala. In Kerala, due to fractured mandate, it is possible that BJP have some bargaining power after elections, but in WB the focus is to have some decent numbers so that RS count of BJP improves. BJP wants to win some urban centers and areas close to Jharkhand and "Gorkhaland".  and if they win say 20-40 seats, it will a big enough win of BJP in Bengal.In Tamilnadu, BJP is clueless because it wants to align with AIADMK ( so that it helps at center LS and RS also) but  Jaya is under corruption scanner and Swamy is the key force opposing her. In TN, BJP just hopes to do better in Kanyakumari, Coimbatore and few areas close to Karnataka. If BJP even win 10-20 seats, it will be a big success from BJP perspective.</comment>

<comment>perfect insight.</comment>

<comment>the bjp in assam should strenghen its support among the majority community and should also take the bodos tribals who have  being mercilessly pushed to the corner by illegal  migrants along with them but in no case should it have a truck with notorious   AGP it still has some traitors in the party remember the notorious mahanta a alliance with agp can backfire on the bjp</comment>

<comment>If The BJP/RSS Ghar wapsi plank works in Assam all the Illegal Bangladeshis will vote for BJP......</comment>

<comment>Ghar wapsi is just a media propaganda to malign RSS-BJP, as the number returning is very few compared to the non-Hindu population.  Real Ghar Wapsi can occur only if a powerful Hindu saint appears and people accept the Hindu faith for practice without any coersion.  Only educated Muslims are moving out of Islam as they are fed up with Jihad and the terror tag attached with Muslims as they find it difficult to get jobs in corporate world.  For e.g, survey shows that net conversion to Islam is zero in USA, Europe etc as quite a few leave Islam while some nuts get converted to Islam.  Assam has 34% Muslim population as per 2011 census.  In 2001, it was only 30% and so it is an alarming rate of 4% in 10 years.  If the trend continues, Assamese Hindus will become minority in their own land.  Islamic mentality is to raise population through higher birth rates and destroy other religious faiths.  Even if 0.5% get converted per year to Hinduism or Buddhism or even Christianity, that would be good as raising Muslim population will only lead to violent Islamic separatist movement in future like in Kashmir in India, Russia, China, Phillipines etc.  Jai Hind.</comment>

<comment>Conversions have stopped almost now. Hence the cry of intolerance!</comment>

<comment>If bjp wants to win Assam ,they have to debar their top most criminal hijda from entering assam</comment>
