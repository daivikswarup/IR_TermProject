<comment>Bihar people should think what is good for them. Stable economic development will only be possible if they have good relationship with center. Center have dedicated focus on development this can be proved how the infrastructure thirst is now visible. Highway road construction has improved significantly from 8Km/day to 26 km/day. JAM is showing positive result. Bihar people should not fall under the left agenda, as per them India is going down after Modi's government. They are creating false perception. I am sure right thing will come out and all NDA supporters will come and caste their vote instead of vote to caste.</comment>

<comment>PEACE LOVEING BIHARI BROTHERS BE AWARE THAT BJP (BHARAT JALAO PARTY) IS SINCERELY IMPLIMENTING THEIR AGENDA, LOOK AT HARYANA, PUNJB, UP, DELHI BJP STANDS FOR BIHAR JALAO PARTY ALSO</comment>

<comment>clutching at the last straws..these are  the first incidents that has happened in this country..otherwise there were no killings under the sickular thugs</comment>

<comment>U r right from the date of partition , thousand of religious & cast base clashes were there and during most of the time Congress was in rule ( ) But never such atmosphere of fear & unrest all over northern India was not there ( ) Will any body answer why South India is different ??</comment>

<comment>heights of insensitivity and bias...Delhi in 1984 was not in north India, bhagalpur was not in North India....Mangalore is not in South India...?? Kerala is not in South India where professor's hands were cut....yes for sickulars only now atmosphere of fear comes...because sickular killings are not killings...who are u to judge the atmosphere of fear and unrest..In Haryana under the thug Hooda Dalit killings increased by 2.5 times...suppressing news by the notorious media during that time and blowing up one incident during another regime doesnt make any change to the existing scenario of India except for the sickular retards</comment>

<comment>Nitish Kumar is most selfish man who destroyed Bihar in last 10 years. Congress is sinking ship which will be wiped out completely in 2/3 years as it is losing one after another states due to massive corruption & bad governance prevailing in Congress ruled states. But Sonia & Rahul are living in FOOL's PARADIZE who have no knowledge of what is happening in Congress ruled states. This party lost power at Center due to massive corruption promoted by Congress leaders. Laloo can provide only JUNGLE RAJ in Bihar while Nitish is total failure after separation with BJP two years back as JD(U) has full of corrupt & incapable leaders adopted from RJD who brought Jungle Raj in last two years. Bihar will never progress if corrupt alliance of RJD- JD(U) - CONGRESS is voted to power. This fact must be remembered by people while voting. BJP should perform well & provide corruption free & good governance if elected. This fact never be forgotten by BJP leaders & past mistakes of neighboring state is not repeated in Bihar as happened in Jharkhand when a defunct govt is formed in state under incompetent CM Reghubar Das who is not qualified & competent for CM post & he failed miserably failed as DYCM in tainted Munda ministry which is main reason for slow progress in this state. This blunder should not be repeated in Bihar by installing Sushil Modi as CM but he can be given ministerial post only. BJP is repeating past mistakes time & again by installing corrupt & illiterate CM & ministers in Jharkhand which should not be repeated again in Bihar in any circumstances.</comment>

<comment>LAU WAPIS LAO</comment>

<comment>NITISH + BJP = BIHAR VIKAS KI AUR NITISH + LALU = JUNGLE RAJ PART-2</comment>

<comment>u r right. So as per ur formula , nitish  is common to both of them!so  BJP=LALU=JUNGALRAJ</comment>

<comment>LOL</comment>

<comment>But when Nitish was with BJP, a  myth was fabricated, manufactured and weaved by the Media that the State was making rapid strides in development.  However, now the harsh reality is sinking in with the separation of partners.  Bihar is still an under developed State, wallowing in BIMARU status and grappled  with poor socio economic indicators.  The levels of privation levels in the State will shame even some of the Third Word African Countries.  Its position has become even more tenuous and precarious after the separation of Jharkhand, a mineral rich State, which seceded from it and this automatically placed the State at a huge disadvantage.  Thus the erstwhile NDA Government is squarely responsible for the miserable situation of Bihar today  as it was under its aegis the States were separated and smaller States were created.  But people are always oblivious of such harsh truths due to lack of general awareness !!This growing disparity of development between the various States of the Indian Union is fraught with dangerous consequences and will  prove detrimental to the Country's long term interests. Due to lack of good income and employment opportunities, people from Bihar migrate to  other States in utter desperation to somehow survive and this phenomenon too is bound to create demographic imbalance !!</comment>

<comment>States/countries/societies do not become develop or great because they r ruled by a certain person or a party but because the "collective human quality" (Progressive thinking, limited role of religion, no stress on preserving so called Sanskaar & sanskriti etc.) is good! Biharis are waiting for a messiah who will pull them out from the hell-whole of poverty and destitution! It would remain a wait till eternity unless they improve their own life values and attitudes!!</comment>

<comment>Not a messiah, just a good administrator that will take care of law and order, and someone that understands how wealth is created. There is no private sector to speak of in Bihar. All activity narrows down to construction, trade, agriculture and services. No manufacturing, None. Nil. Nada.The messiah, as you call that person, will simply need to create the conditions to attract capital.Bihar is blessed with plenty of water, and proximity to coal mines. Power plants, anyone?The stifling social constraints that you mention to inhibit creative minds, but not necessarily factory work. Evidence is mixed, but a strong sense of tradition can actually help deal with the stresses of factory work. Notice that most car plans in the US that have opened recently is in the Bible belt, not the liberal/libertarian west coast. That's where the ideas people are.</comment>

<comment>Firstly In democracy you get the kind of rule you deserve! You guys voted  Lalu for 3 consecutive terms not someone else. Even before him situation was similar. Corruption, crime, nepotism it is all the same across the country. But why is it that Bihar is virtually unlivable, which is not the case with Gujrat, maharstra, Himachal, all southern states etc? Why is it that the cast is still a prime factor in elections in Bihar? The fault does not lie with any CM or any neta but the people of Bihar! And u r not alone! Today UPites cannot complain for for cime in UP! because the themselves voted a Gunda party like SP to power! Delhites wanted a relatively corruption free rule..they got AAP. I know truth is bitter but try to swallow it. It will benefit you and your fellow biharis.</comment>

<comment>Biharis are No. 1 in India today...Period.</comment>

<comment>If this is a joke...then I appreciate ur effort!</comment>

<comment>The highest number of IITians are Biharis...</comment>

<comment>The Highest number of low paid workers across the country are also Biharis. On all human development parameters Bihar is the one of the worst places on earth. And u feel proud instead of improving the things?? What a shame!</comment>

<comment>Highest number of hawkers in mumbai are biharis</comment>

<comment>It has become a fashion to show Bihar in bad light these days. Hawker hoga tera baap.- No. of Bihari doctors is higher than No. of Gujju doctors + No. of Panjabi doctors- Highest number of candidates from Bihar crack IAS exams- 20% of IT industry workforce is from Bihar.Bhojpuri is extensively spoken and understood on the streets of IT hubs like Bangalore, Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad and Gurgaon.</comment>

<comment>Do you have the stats on what you talking about ?? Do you even know what is literacy rate in bihar?. Just type these in google "indian state literacy rate". Get a job man. Fact is, state government do not provide sufficient work opportunities for local, so they migrate and end up in doing inferior jobs.</comment>

<comment>Happy Pooja holidays fellow Indians.</comment>

<comment>Thank you!</comment>

<comment>You are welcome. Even I do Pooja at my home. I occasionally go to mosques to get blessings from "Bhai". And go to Church frequently.Please don't call me a "Sickular".</comment>

<comment>No I won't. That's interesting. So what do you find in temples, mosques and church? Do you feel the same mood in all three? How is the experience different?</comment>

<comment>Nitish is the only CM who asked judiciary to give quick verdicts and due to that no village or colony in a city remains without prosecution of the guilty irrespective of religion or caste and public have a fear of law things are too good in-respect of previous conditions and Biharis are no more going out of Bihar which is result of good governance</comment>

<comment>NOW NITISH + LALU WILL MAKE EVERYONE PROUD</comment>

<comment>Nitish has done some good work but more was required since laloo destroyed the bihar fate and took it 100 years back.If Nitish wanted bihar development , he could have easily allied with BJP and MODI and could have thought of People and nt his ego..For people of bihar he could have taken huge advantage of bjp being in power in center.Bihar missed another great opportunity due to Nitish</comment>

<comment>More dark...less bright...</comment>

<comment>An out of box thought process contradicting mainstream media:With the lynching and the killing of Muslims by RSS elements, with the incendiary rhetoric / divisive statements of Haryana CM, BJP Union Ministers, BJP Law Makers, MPs and MLAs; it is quite natural that Muslims have turned away from BJP.Thus BJP has become lame duck deprived from almost one crore and twenty five lakh Muslim Votes from Bihar.RSS Chief's reminder to BJP to review the current reservation policy has turned away the OBC, EBC, SC and ST from BJP. This way, BJP is now deprived of the majority of 65% of Bihar population.With APND Modi making only Jumla, the general mass has turned away from BJP. All the people waited for Rs. 15 Lakhs for one-and-a half year instead they have got daal at Rs. 200 per kg.Biharis, mostly the poor, the deprived, the hand to mouth are furious at Modi for he follows crony capitalism and he has shun the constitutional duty of following the co-operative socialism!Only that particular class of people who dominated Bihar politics, prior to Mandal, majority of the ex-congressmen, and now have joined BJP in the hope of ruling Bihar again will automatically vote for BJP. This is the solid 15% vote bank of BJP - all weather ready, ever ready vote bank. BJP has logically given more than 50% of seats to this class. Interesting to note that the party with a difference, who abuse other political parties of minority apeasement and minority vote bank politics is performing same. Lesson - Is hamaam mein sab nangen hain!Mr. Amit Shah is using every Kautaliya Neeti in Bihar election, sam, dam, dand, vibhed.He recognised that dam works best in Bihar. And I learnt that BJP is distributing among the Bihari electorates Rs.10, 000 Crores. But this amount may fetch the BJP close to one Crore votes only. Since BJP needs at least 2.5 Crore votes in Bihar, its appropriately right time that BJP increases the amount to be distributed to Rs. 25, 000 Crore before it is too late!As if stationing half of the union cabinet ministers and most of the BJP MPs in Patna is not considered sufficiently enough for campaign, BJP is ringing danger bells demanding law makers from BJP ruled states to increase the quantum of the campaign but the sore outcome is that the Bihari electorates are refusing to listen to these Baharis, the outsiders. May be additional laws of Chanakya Neeti need to be applied.Last but not least: Wise ex-RSS Pracharak said: “If RSS ‘really’ (emphasis on ‘really’) wants you to win an election, almost no power on earth can stop you from winning an election!”Therefore Encounter King Amit Shah and Ham Panch Hamare Pachees Narendra Modi must drop every thing and run to Nagpur and beg RSS Chief to issue a Fatawa, a Firman to the RSS members to join the prachar lest Bihar 2015 becomes India 2004, 2009 fiasco!</comment>

<comment>http // zeenews india com/news/karnataka/four-more-suspects-arrested-in-prashant-poojary-murder-case_1812651.htmlNo one is talking about assassination of Poojary and the witness. What a anti-Hindu media Indian media is? Never seen a country whose media hates its people so much</comment>

<comment>They have arrested the gang responsible and also seized a lot of valuables. The police deserve a pat on their backs for cracking the case!</comment>

<comment>While comparing economies of Bihar to Gujarat andMaharashtra, one also has to look at central assistance to Bihar. Bihar getsalmost three times as much central funds as Gujarat. This obviously helps raisethe GSDP and per capital income of that state. Also, as correctly pointed outthe size of Bihar’s economy is also very small so growth rate comparisonscannot be made with states like Gujarat and Maharashtra. Overall good to seethat under Nitish the state has developed much faster than Laloo.</comment>

<comment>if growth is the priority for bihar, and it surely seems to be, the bjp is the natural choice, and the only choice.india is gearing itself to play in the big league in the world. bihar can not not participate in it.best wishes to bihar.</comment>

<comment>Bihar produce only officer and migrant workers and Politician but there attitude towards development is less..</comment>

<comment>Before the British established their trade, Bihar was a very rich. The fertile gangetic plains enriched the lives of people. The plunder of Bihar started with the British Opium cultivation and the hoarding of rice grains and burning of evergreen forests. The deliberately created famines resulted in migrations to other parts of the world in search of food and work. The British and other greedy Indian business families extracted the maximum out of these indentured laborers and labelled them as coolies. The destruction of forests caused severe droughts in summer and floods during monsoon. Now it is the time to start regaining the lost glory</comment>

<comment>U r living in a fool's paradise!

<comment>yes. only formality to be performed. result is a foregone conclusion.</comment>

<comment>Hope BJP Wins this Bihar Election.If the country has to grow beyond caste politics and enter development based politics it is very essential for Bihar to elect NDA.</comment>

<comment>Even Modi ji forgot his development agenda in Bihar. It's starage that Bhakts are still believing in fake developments.</comment>

<comment>BJP is the biggest threat to communal fabric. And Congress is full of $hit too. We are living in a state where there is no real alternative.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>BJP also has criminals is better statement than saying it is full of criminals. But it definitely has far less no of criminals than other parties like congress, RJD,  SP etc.In the given circumstances BJP is better choice. When circumstances change and you have better alternatives then we can elect alternative. </comment>

<comment>All parties are full of criminals including AAP which has many criminal MLA's. CHeck myneta dot info. BJP's leadership is clean and visionary when it comes to development. That's what we need.</comment>

<comment>"BJP's leadership is clean..."  Ha haa haaaa.... A hardcore criminal and a 'Tadipar' from his state for years by order of the Supreme Court of India is the national president of BJP... and another ex-president was caught red-handed taking bribe on Tehelka tapes and convicted for it by all level of courts. And let us not discuss about their present supremo, his antecedent is well-known to the world. He might have been successful in manipulating witnesses and evidences for the time being, but someday he is bound to go to jail and grind the 'chakki'...</comment>

<comment>Will somebody enlighten public why the "Teli" cast was referred in Election campaigning and by whom ( )</comment>

<comment>From the very beginning it was well known that BJP will be a mega flop in Bihar. Not only in Bihar, but the coming 6 more state elections. Everybody knows that BJP is a party of conmasters and tricksters and if they promise to shower doles of lakhs of crores of rupees, it is a blatant lie. Not even one rupee of black money has come back. People of Bihar know BJP has no future in the country. Especially after Modi became the PM.</comment>

<comment>Lets see the results. The nation went a decade back under erst while tyrant dirty rule of UPA and congress. The nation is very much happy to accept Modi and his initiatives. It is not easy to resurrect a nation that was ruined by the UPA. India will progress by its own if at least there are no scams, arson and damage committed by UPA. Lets see who has future. The age old party called Congress hasn't even got opposition status.we know who has no future.</comment>

<comment>People like to know the status of Agriculture sector in Bihar, which has been neglected by the learned colomunist ( ) This is important because after separation of Jharkhand it is only source employment and wealth generation ( )"Bihar’s employment story is the missing private sector" () This is the story of whole Eastern India main reason the "freight Equalization policy" to favor western & southern part of India ( ) Now great economists in support of Indian capitalists are saying that unless Govt spends money the investment in Public sector will not start ( ) Now the question is how central Govt spent by Govts ( ) Lat of all Bihar has been robbed of their natural resources,by creating JHARKHAND, which could have invite pvt investment</comment>

<comment>Hafta and apharan is main reson for lack of private sector in bihar,</comment>

<comment>Agreed, but was there Apaharan during Nitish regime ?What about RAPE Capital of India ( ) People like to know per day rape in Delhi & Bihar ( ) Waiting for reply regarding Agriculture in Bihar </comment>

<comment>Vote for Lalu for better development of western states who will get cheap labors from Bihar.</comment>

<comment>KD is correct. It is Nitish who approached RJD and Congress. They also needed relevance.JD(U) is a caged bird of RJD and Congress.In this respect Lalu commands more respect than Nitish!!!</comment>

<comment>LoL</comment>

<comment>Vote for Laloo and save secularism but lose the real issue of development, employment.</comment>

<comment>Laloo is secular ? Was that a joke</comment>

<comment>EVEN AFTER 10 YRS OF SICKULAR KUMAR,S RULE THERE IS ONLY  POCKETS OF BRIGHTNESS AND HUGE AREA OF DARKNESS GLOOM AND POVERTY AND THIS IS THE MAN WHO WANTS TO COME BACK TO POWER CAN A BIHARI EVER TRUSTS THIS MAN</comment>

<comment>"Bihar's economy lags Indian economy by about 15 years. If it has to achieve an important position in India's economy, then it must focus on a development model that creates jobs for all. The private sector is almost missing in Bihar economy, with not even a handful of large or medium industries to be counted. In a nutshell, it has a long way to go"You think Lalu will help Bihar catch up and attract private investment? Whom are the G*and Alliance supporters fooling?</comment>
