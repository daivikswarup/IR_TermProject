<comment>Looks like anti-India and Pro-Pakistani comments are on the rise ever since Modi visited Pakistan and hugged Nawaz Sharief??? Blind Bhakths following their leader blindly???</comment>

<comment>There's a wonderful 20th century invention called Camera that records and reproduces events as and when needed. And with cameras in action, no amount of justification or cover-up can fool the public. Gone are the days when public opinion were shaped, moulded and impressed based on speeches and arguments. Now people see by themselves and frame their own opinion.</comment>

<comment>There are also a technologies called Photoshop, Cinema 4D, Corel Draw, Lightworks, Sony Vegas Pro, Cinelerra, Pinnacle Studio etc etc which can be used to fool some gullible people</comment>

<comment>I agree. But you must also admit that in this technology driven world, there are tools and labs that can conveniently track doctoring of tapes and records through Photoshop, Cinema 4D, Corel Draw, Lightworks, Sony Vegas Pro, Cinelerra, Pinnacle Studio etc etc. We should have faith in our judicial system that such manipulation won't withstand the scrutiny of law.</comment>

<comment>The Great Indian Judicial System which ensured Salman Khan and Jayalalitha went scot free??? Technology is used by Humans and when these Humans are themselves Corrupt what could you possibly do???Like in Salman Hit-and-Run case they used a Computer to type the Blood Report and then they claimed it was a Typographical error. Computer cant be blamed. What could the Judicial System do about it??? How many people in these labs were suspended for dereliction of duty???</comment>

<comment>BOMB 'EM ALL, BOMB 'EM GOOD. DESTROY EVERY F*CKIN ''STUDENT'' UNION IN THE COUNTRY YANK OUT THEIR KIDNEYS,LIVERS, GENITALS FREEZE THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS, CANCEL THEIR PASSPORTS, BLACKLIST THEM TO OBLIVION. DON'T SPARE A SINGLE A$$WIPE ANTI HINDU IN THIS COUNTRY.</comment>

<comment>Subject: ANTI NATIONAL UNIVERSITY MASQUERADING AS INTELLECTUAL THINK TANKTo: dr_acad@mail.jnu.ac.in, dr_admin@mail.jnu.ac.in, secy.dhe@nic.inRegistrars JNU,Your awful university is wasting taxpayers money and hosting and supporting anti national activities, because of spineless officials like you and your vice chancellor.  In his appearance itself he looks like 'namak haraam' who would sell his mother to keep his position.Freedom of expression is contingent to ensuring unity and integrity of the nation.  Please read the preamble of the Indian Constitution, which I am sure that you anti-national elements have not read.You sit in the heart of our country and become silent observers to the anti national slogans and shamelessly take high emoluments at our expense and pretend to be intellectual which in fact you are cowards, who would sell the nation and hide under your tables when anti national shameless uncouth and sick criminals who masquerade as students start barking anti national slogans in front of you.  Your ineffectiveness while your criminal students lionize a terrorist; Afzal Guru, is enough to make you a complicit and subject to sedition charge.Pathetic and helpless looks of your vice chancellor, who is supporting and abetting anti national activities at the campus shows him as a pliable person who would succumb to pressure and would willingly subjugate himself to any menial service to any oppressor,  to earn his daily bread.SHAME! SHAME AND SHAME.  If you have any ounce of moral conscience left in you I am sure all three of you would resign.  I have no doubt your shameless breed would continue to cling to your chairs and continue to shame our country feeding your wife and children with the money of the taxpayers that you thieve from us.Secretary of Higher Education.  I did not find the email address of the Union Minister for HRD hence I am writing this email to you.  Please ensure you show it to the Cabinet Minister and take action against the spineless officials at university.Any true Indian would not tolerate anti-national activity in our country.</comment>

<comment>Why did JNU leftist students groups not oppose holding of program in first place?</comment>

<comment>Why were leftists associated with secessionists? There is no circumlocution. I am just coming back to sad reality of culture of socialist legal robbery manifesting itself as secessionism - because the socialists may have realized it is impossible to come to an understanding on who the supreme dictator should be and they want to establish numerous single part dictatorships over fragments of country.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------India is the only nation in world where teachers are murdered by students. There is a film in Kannada "Nagarahavu" where a useless student murders his teacher. Indian people, Socialist legal robbers, consider him a hero! A remake in Hindi was Zehrila Insan - I have not watched the Hindi version and I dont know if it exact copy of Nagarahavu. The problem is, India is an Ocholocracy[mob rule] where Individual rights are murdered[example is murder of merit an Individual right by reservation policy and property rights by socialism. Socialism is legal robbery.A period of good dictatorship may be required to cure Indians of disease of bad democracy, due to the infection of socialism or legal robbery. Otherwise bad democracy can kill in millions like in Cambodia under Pol Pot. Ocholocracy looks like democracy but it is not - 30 years of no elections, even if it means lot of blood shed will do India good. Just look at immorality of Indians- Laloo the reason for largest migration of Biharis from Bihar was reelected.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anti-Brahmin comment from possible Pakistani spies like , Kali Kutty, shows that it is anti-national to attack brahmins[modern dalits].</comment>

<comment>I think as long as kejri's evil pervades Delhi this anti national feeling will get fanned. Ford and cia reps have infiltrated the student body.Passing out scopolamine and designer drugs they're manipulating kids to become evil.Like Oswald, ruby and sirhan sirhan these zombies know not what they say or do. </comment>

<comment>Not Giving Bharat Ratna to Dhyan Chand and Giving Sachin Tendulkar Bharat Ratna ahead of him is even more Anti National, Just shows how shabby the Pro-National Things are.Bharat Ratna awards and Padma Bhushan awards are more ANTI NATIONAL  Than anything</comment>

<comment>All comments posted by you are also anti-national. Take a life and enjoy.</comment>

<comment>Leaders like Yachuri, Raja and Sibbal deserve condemnation for supporting anti-national elements in JNU for raising slogans against India. These elements have vitiated the university atmosphere and deserve to be put behind bars to set an example for others not to indulge in anti-national activities. These elements must be expelled from the university.</comment>

<comment>Watching movies of Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan is also Anti-National.Making Amitabh Bachan, Anupam Kher Indian representatives is also Anti-National.Hema Malini's car killing a small Girl and her arrongant response was also Anti-National.Not Hanging Sanjay Dutt for his involvement in Mumbai Blasts is anti-National.You have encouraged Anti-National activities and have breeded them, why complain now, Just because you dont like something.</comment>

<comment>Idiot ,unlike your party Indian Courts are deciding on such punishments. You can proceed with barbaric "party Courts" as done in WB and Kerala. But Judiciary will prevail. Don't blame nationalists</comment>

<comment>It is JNU administration which should be asked all the questions because incident happened on their campus. But we are masters at talking politics-wise first</comment>

<comment>JNU is not a republic, and the students have to remember those who killed by dirty afza*:;!guru</comment>

<comment>Arrest all those anti nationals in JNU campus. JNU is not serving any purpose as all anti national elements are finding a refuge there as is with FTII. Government may consider closing these cess pools of dirt in the society for good.</comment>

<comment>Where are these..Sonia,pappu. ,Nitish ,laalo,Mulyam Singh,,Award returning. Tolerant. Brigade ,& others mom on  feb. 9th ,incidence at.

<comment>Dog is always better, It has always been for centuries.Anti-National things are triggered by Pro-National People , they want fun and some work to do so they are breaking things, then they will jump in to Fix things and they will tell public, we will do even better</comment>

<comment>What are communists views on Netaji Subhash Bose, here are some examples ;-Communists derided Netaji as running dog of imperialism when he defied the Communist call for support to the British during World War II. They, through the mouthpiece of the undivided CPI, hurled choicest epithets against Netaji, variously describing him as 'a cur held up by Goebbles', 'the running dog of Japanese general Tojo', 'the donkey carrying Tojo', 'a midget being led by a Japanese imperialist', and as a mere mask of the Japanese imperialist ogre'.</comment>

<comment>LOL the videos are telling lies, only they are telling the truth.</comment>

<comment>Smriti Irani should resign for giving permissiom for such anti national event... the plea of withdrawing permission later is not enough...</comment>

<comment>Rahul, Raja, Yechuri and Sibal should also be arrested for supporting anti-national elements charged with sedition. CPM and Congress should be declared anti-national parties by election commission and banned from contesting elections.</comment>

<comment>AAP and congress and communists are Brahmin dominated parties</comment>

<comment>1)Dahir king of Sindh, was BRAHMIN. By enlisting the support of local tribes (such as the Jats, Meds and Bhuttos) and Buddhist rulers of Nerun, Bajhra, Kaka Kolak and Siwistan as infantry to his predominantly-mounted army, Muhammad bin Qasim defeated Dahir and captured his eastern territories for the Umayyad Caliphate.Dahir then tried to prevent Qasim from crossing the Indus River, moving his forces to its eastern banks. Eventually, however, Qasim crossed and defeated forces at Jitor led by Jaisiah (Dahir's son). Qasim fought Dahir at Raor (near modern Nawabshah) in 712, killing him; Dahir's wife immolated herself (with other women in her household) in accordance with the Hindu tradition of Jauhar.2)Jai Chand was KshatriyaWho are traitors? Brahmins or is it Jats, Meds, Bhuttos or Bhuddists, and Kshatriyas? You being ISI agent will you say the latter?</comment>

<comment>You missed the "NOT" before Brahmin... :)</comment>

<comment>You are Right, so People will oppose you, It is just like telling Ganga is Holy river, but it will remain polluted for a long time , It is still holy on Paper and sacred but is dirty and pollluted</comment>

<comment>Brahmins are the not the persons? Because of this pathetic mindset, India is going down day by day & it will continue until people like you are doing caste based politics...</comment>

<comment>There are Brahmins and There were Chadidharis'. Chadidharis are not brahmin..</comment>

<comment>the best thing that we can do now is to ask our pm to resign ...its only because of this that these fight are happeing ...wen during our congress such things never happened</comment>

<comment>Bramhins are angry at the loss of power.Bramhins from communist party and AAP and congress are angry at the loss of power and privileges.These Bramhins and Bania from communist and AAP and congress are trying to create instability and wish to dethrone OBC MODI</comment>

<comment>Most of the so called brahmins in congress are fake. They are either muslims (eg Jawahar Lal Nehru and his progeny) or xtians eg Manish Tiwari, Sobha Oza etcAll this to fool hindus en masse and gain legitimacy. So technically as  a Hindu and brahmin i support eliminating so called brahmins from Congress, Commies and AAP</comment>

<comment>I just heard that Amir Khan and Shahruk khan have got throat cancer and cannot speak on this JNU matter !!!. It is a co-incidence that both got cancer at same time.....</comment>

<comment>They gave ORAL to Pappu and now mouth is closed</comment>

<comment>The same way as Feku give to Karan thapar during TV interview on Godhara and his mouth was closed.</comment>

<comment>If need, police should encounter these anti-national thugs.....there is nothing to lose...they are just burden on tax payers money.</comment>

<comment>Naxalitie, muslim terrorists, saffron fanatics....on one side....Indians on one side...</comment>

<comment>Be an INDIANThrow out the ANit-Nationals.for Once stop politics on this and unite against ANTI INDIANS.Black list such students and teachers from not only this particular institute buy nationally so that they cannot spread their hatred towards our Country in young minds and if require shut down the Institute. We do not want such people studying or residing here. Send them to PAKISTAN and let them enjoy their freedom there.Since this country is so tolerant they feel they can speak anything?Slap them with sedation charges and throw them behind bar to ROT</comment>

<comment>All these shameless left supporters crying free speech should remember that free speech does not include sedition! If the speech has the potential to destroy the fabric of social and nation harmony...the police and the government are well within their rights to put their seditious a55e5 behind bars...</comment>

<comment>NDTV is the only channel which refused to show the video of these anti-nationals...Burkha and other anti-national anchors said they cannot show the video since they are not sure if it is fabricated !!!. But when they want to show some hindu outfits in bad light they just jump without even verifying if it is fake or not...typical anti-national channel....</comment>

<comment>Shame on u... U guess a person on the outfit??? </comment>

<comment>This country belongs to great Ashoka and Great MK Gandhi ji  and not to these foolish students, Govt should handle them with firm hands so others should never utter Pakistan zindabad in dreams. Some leaders have become anti India, they should be taught a lesson.</comment>

<comment>Whole India is against these anti-nationals....Govt should take this opportunity to decimate the Communists once for all....Communists were trapped in their own net....If there was no video evidence, these anti-nationals would have said that there was no such incidents and ABVP disrupted the peace...</comment>

<comment>In Punjabi it is said "PAASA PUTHA PAI GAYA".Lefists have made plan to embarrass Modi Govt. but are now searching place to hide due to hue public outrage.</comment>

<comment> every moron is let to speak about freedom of expression  ....tht is the Ddefinition of demoncracy</comment>

<comment>The 'freedom of expression" can't be an Absolute right in any responsible democracy.There's immense scope for  debate , dialogue and  airing one's views with in the constitutional framework. Abuse of the Constitution and the freedom granted by  it  should not be taken lightly by any State  founded on its very  principles.</comment>

<comment>All those saying Pakistan zindabad should loose their indian citizenship n govt should be hang them, including any one supporting them. Shame to yechuri n JDU leaders. Students enjoy on our taxed money n we would not allow them to support Pakistan n Kashmir separatists</comment>

<comment>This incident showed us some facts and its time to take action:1. if anyone is student, it doesn't mean that they have right to do anti-national / hooliganism under the mask of student. Also, they don't have the license to break the rules of national interest. If they have problem with any party or personality, then raise voice against him, It doesnot means that they have right to raise voice against a country integrity/union/existence,.2. some anti-national JNU students think that they are the only good students who are made for raise voice and lead for raising voice against anybody whether that anybody is your motherland. So for those student information, you are not only good student in this country. this country has crores of student and all are the son of this motherland.3 . that how indian political parties have support and use JNU for long time only for support their mean political idealogy and benefit.4. linking of student union with political parties should stop.5. student is only meant to study not for hooliganism. So university discipline should be strict.6. We should wonder on this anti-national incident and it shows that its time to think about the ulterior motives of anti-national elements behind the existence of the top central funded institutions like JNU,JAMIA, AMU and other central universities.6.There should be decentralization of educational institute so that counting of good universities increase without atleast anti-nationalism. JNU has cream professor and student from all over India. So if JNU is producing leaders then we shouldnot wonder on the institute ability to produce leaders.</comment>

<comment>Messages are circulating that JNU has room rent of Rs.11/- per month. Annul fee is Rs.219/- per year payable in 2 insalments.  Mess charges subsidised through free manpower and infrastructure.  11 hostels were there in 1990 and now it is 22.  More outsiders and illegal can stay in the night.  CAN ANYONE CONFIRM THE TARIFF AS ABOVE BEING CIRCULATED ?</comment>

<comment>The tariffs are true</comment>

<comment>Besides tariffs,university has to find out whether outsiders are residing in the campus and what they do there.Form university protection force to guard against anti nationals.</comment>

<comment>Kejruddin have tweeted today after 5 day of  what happen in JNU, and that too against Modi. Delhi people just celebrate this idiot whom you have elected.</comment>

<comment>Kejri and Pappu are not taken seriously anymore. Sorry, Pappu was not taken seriously anytime, but Krazywala came with big reputation and lost everything over the time bcos of his stupid comments as well as behaving like he is the only right person in the world. Their time is over.</comment>

<comment>What can we expect from third class B@stards like kejruddin</comment>

<comment>Just visit the Facebook timeline of Umar Khalid (with a U) you will get a clear cut picture of JNU has become. Please do this and judge for your self.People of Delhi your roots are on fire. You have Maoists living in your midst.</comment>

<comment>Just visit the Facebook timeline of Umar Khalid (with a U) you will get a clear cut picture of JNU has become. Please do this and judge for your self.People of Delhi your roots are on fire. You have Maoists living in your midst. Please visit</comment>

<comment>No, Umar Khalid can't be a Maiosts, why ??He is actually a Jehadi preteding to be Maoists. Being leftists is just a Burqa these Jehadis wrap themselves to hide there true colours.Maxists or Maoists or leftists ideology does not recogonise religion or God, but all these Leftists with muslim names are very particular in performing Namaaz and Rozas. All there revolution and fight against superstition is only against HIndu Culture. And last Casteism is there favourite subject, because it is the subject they use to divide Hindus.</comment>

<comment>So, Rahul Gandhi, Raja, Yechuri are supporting anti-national elements who were shouting slogans of Pakistan zindabad, Desh ki barbadi tak jung jari rahega, condemning Indian judiciary, Afzal Guru shaheed hai  and do not find anything wrong to arrest the culprits. The Communist party who has always been known to be anti-national towing China agenda but now Congress has joined it just for making political gains is going to boomeranged on the latter will be carry the the tags of most corrupt along with anti-national party. Thank God the immature with low IQ credentials is not the PM and he never will be anytime in future.</comment>

<comment>Just visit the Facebook timeline of Umar Khalid (with a U) you will get a clear cut picture of JNU has become. Please do this and judge for your self.People of Delhi your roots are on fire. You have Maoists living in your midst.</comment>

<comment>Yechury, Kejriwal, Lalu Lead by Rahul Gandhi will go to Pakistan to Invite All great Leaders named as terrorists to come & take over India. They will ensure all the Armed Forces personnel & all hindus are branded as Anti Nationals. Great Indian politics. Shame on India.</comment>

<comment>All this is happening becuase gappu is in power,,ABVP called outsiders to raise anti India slogans,this can not happen without complicity by bhadva jumla party,s top most bhadva gappu</comment>

<comment>to all the readers and commentators.... please do not bear hatred in hearts.... this is what some ppl want.... the more strength we show as a nation the more discouraged and helpless they will be....</comment>

<comment>Reading the reports there will be misconception that admission to JNU is the sole prerogative of leftists.</comment>

<comment>Well, most of the professors of JNU are Maxists. The questions for entrance examinations and interview are taken by the Marxists Professors. It is quite difficult for a young student having strong sense of Nationalism or critical thinking about Marxist ideology to get admission in JNU. Either you have to be leftists or to be novice who can be later moulded into Marxism by these professors, your chances of getting admissions are quite bright.</comment>

<comment>Find them all and all their sympathizers and put them bar for years. JNU is not in PAKSITAN. DESH KI BARBADI TAK JUNG JARI RAHEGA, these were the slogans. I have  see the video and any INDIAN blood will boil. Now the JUNG has started with the anti nationals. If you arrange prayers for AFZAL GURU ,these  anti Indians things will happen in the meeting. AFZAL GURU got fair trial and SUPREME COURT had given the verdict. Then matter should rest there. Why playing anti national politics.</comment>

<comment>JNUSU and others involved must be punished. Anti-national students like Rohit(in Hyd case) must feel the heat this time and no one should dare to repeat this kind of nonsense. Being Indian everyone should condemn the anti-national activities regardless of their party and religion.</comment>

<comment>but what can one do.... if like of cm and opposition party leaders visit in huge numbers and celebrate them.....</comment>

<comment>thats the irony. But people will wake up.  98% of Indian population does not support anti-nationals . They will stop voting for the leaders who support anti-nationals soon.</comment>

<comment>why there was no debate on HIND SWARAJ GANDHIAN ELECTION SYSTEM VS CONSUMERISM AND SLAVERY OF PAPER CURRENCY CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY UNABLE TO SERVE THE WEAKEST IN D LIGHT OF TALISMAN OF MKGANDHI JNUSU MUST REPLY</comment>

<comment>It is a pity that Congress is supporting these anti nationals</comment>

<comment>anything is possible may be the bjp too.....all r gundass.</comment>

<comment>Congress is waiting for one of the students to commit suicide after he gets punished for anti national activities!</comment>

<comment>Because of CONGRESS only these people get embolden. Now the time to put them in place.</comment>

<comment>When Hanumanthappa was fighting for his life these anti national bostards were raising anti national slogans.  Send them to meet Ishrat Jahan</comment>

<comment>Give them the treatment that was given to Jahan Ishrat the terrorist</comment>

<comment>I like your user name! Yes, the anti-nationals need stringent punishment.</comment>

<comment>JNU is congress bastion. The JNU spoke person inadvertently acknowledges that it is currently supported by congress.It is a shame that while soldiers are sacrificing their lives for the country, there are traitors working against the people!</comment>

<comment>JNU is a leftist bastion, not Congress. Congressis are just worried about there pockets and to invent new methods to loot India. The leftist have been taking advantage of this corrupt Congress and founded JNU like institution with more 95% leftists professors to brainwash young students from whole India to Marxist Ideology to bring there blood soaked revolution.</comment>

<comment>These Students who raise anti Indian Slogans and try to disturb the society should be permanently removed from the University and prevented from getting into  any of the institution in India. They should be made and example of for other such prospective people. They are taking advantage of our tolerance. Anticipate what would happen if the same is done in USA, England or worse in Pakistan....... I think we are more lenient towards these fellows.</comment>

<comment>What is anti India???bhadva jumla party is considering anti gappu protest as anti india</comment>

<comment>Bhadva spotted here.</comment>

<comment>Well, but the same action was taken against Rohith Vemulla of Hyderabad University, he also organised prayer meeting for Terrorist Yakub Memon, he was an open Naxalite supporter. He was suspended from the Hostel only, not from attending the class for studies, but he commit suicide in the same hostel where he was not supposed to be there after suspension. The reaction of one section of Media and some parties have embolden other leftist or anti-nationals to organise more function in other parts of India also.</comment>

<comment>insey pucch tacchh karnner ki zaroorat kya hai?????salo sey  yey yahi to krtey hain .......yey   purey desh ka apmaan hai......jago jago inko benakaab karo..jis thali mein khatey hain usee meein chhed krney walo ko sakht saza miley.......</comment>

<comment>Ms. Rashid inform the police where these students are holed up . Them we will beleive that you take pride in being an Indian. This wishy-washy condemnation is too easy and won't do.</comment>

<comment>Well, you are right, now after huge public outrage in whole India, these leftist traitors are coming out and saying that they condemn the anti-national slogans, but the question remains the same if you were against these slogans and socalled cultural programme, than why you don't file a compliant with JNU Admin. like the ABVP did. why you don't try to stop these anti-national elements like the ABVP did.All this matter is now in public domain just because of the vigil of the ABVP, not because of you Shehla Rashid.why Kanhayya Kumar was seen in a video on the side of anti-national students and fighting with ABVP students.Shehla Rashid, you are afraid now, we can see the fear in your eyes now, we have seen the pale face of revolutionery Kanhya Kumar yesterday when he was taken in police custody. You people deliberately organsied this function because you were embolden by the wrong reaction of one section of media and pseudo-secular parties of India in Rohith Vemulla case in Hyderabad. Rohith was also a sympathiser of Naxalites and Jehadi Terrorist like Yakub Memon.</comment>

<comment>How did other students agree to join such a protest. Seems in present times it is easy to mislead people with proliferation of social media.</comment>

<comment>Leftist brainwashing is the answer. JNU was founded just to brainwash young students to Maxist ideology and to capture the power in New Delhi by creating atmosphere for bloody revolution.</comment>

<comment>Anybody who is a friend of convicted terrorist (Afzal Guru), is not Indian. He should be shown the Pakistani visa office, so that he could go there.</comment>

<comment>Make strickter laws with zero tolerance towards antinational activities... And suspend them from the very curriculum if theyr found guilty ..let them not study if they hv an antinational or criminal background or  association. Then lets see ..jhak maar ke padhai pe dhyan denge .. Coz I'm sure all are there to study..so hit it where it hurts the most.</comment>

<comment>Is this all a cunning plan to disrupt the budget session?? i would'nt put it past them</comment>

<comment>Yes SENSEX is sleeping at 23K what hell he  Govt can answer for their poor performance?</comment>

<comment>YOU tell me.....what the HELL can you do even if you are the PM...? the parliament does not function you can not pass ANY bills except the budget....? how do you effect change? with the bureaucrats ganging up against you???</comment>

<comment>does the article talk abt sensex? why diverting from the issue?</comment>

<comment>The poor are not looking at the sensex. Duffer.</comment>

<comment>They are not looking at the cow either.</comment>

<comment>No, they are definitely looking at the anti-national 'pigs'</comment>

<comment>You mean cows are not anti-national at all? Esp the cows reared in Nagpur and Ahmadabad.</comment>

<comment>26 JAN republic day is celebrated by ANTI NATIONALS as black day can u name such anti natinals and can we see same debate and outrage if not, f***king stop your selective patriotism. What happened in JNU is not justified but what happened on 26 JAN is also amount to DESHDROH</comment>

<comment>those who celebrated republic day as blackday are definitely traitors; if they are identified they will be dealt with.what was done by JNUSU was inside the compound and the campus was used to eulogise anti nationals dealt with by the judiciary as undemocratic and judicial killing.  the institution is meant for studies and not for anti national activities. if the office bearers were not responsible for this who were? if they are unable to control their rank and file they should be accountable. if the slogan shouting was by outsiders, why did the JNUSU invited them? Shehla your president was clearly holding anti national placards and giving anti national speech and did anti national slogan shouting and his arrest is clearly warranted. if the JNUSU office bearers are sure none of their members did indulge in anti-national activities, then their invitees are the ones who did these.  identify them, name them and hand over details to the police; till then cool your heels in jail.the whole exercise is arising out of absolute intolerance of a democratic process in which the people decided to elevate someone else who you hate and trampled so long in connivance with your political affiliates.  this is no more tolerable and made possible.  do not blame the authorities for the arrests.you cannot enjoy the rights under the constitution and at the same time castrate it also.</comment>

<comment>Shut down this factory that breeds such cowards , who rather than improving the situation try to worsen it for their own profit, filthy opportunists ,they can sell this country in the name of human rights. Idiots</comment>

<comment>Baba saheb Ambedkar was absolutely right about the communist and socialist.The condemnation of the Constitution largely comes from two quarters, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. Why do they condemn the Constitution? Is it because it is really a bad Constitution? I venture to say no’. The Communist Party want a Constitution based upon the principle of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. They condemn the Constitution because it is based upon parliamentary democracy. The Socialists want two things. The first thing they want is that if they come in power, the Constitution must give them the freedom to nationalize or socialize all private property without payment of compensation. The second thing that the Socialists want is that the Fundamental Rights mentioned in the Constitution must be absolute and without any limitations so that if their Party fails to come into power, they would have the unfettered freedom not merely to criticize, but also to overthrow the State.- Dr. Ambedkar</comment>

<comment>Also what Baba Saheb has written about Muslim fanatic mindset is also worth to read, he has written a book named "Pakistan, The Partition of India"</comment>

<comment>Thorough investigations is needed on their family backgrounds.1) Check which all relatives pay tax properly. Raid all relatives at least till 3 generations.2) Transfer all of their relatives if working for government positions to hellish places.3) Send a few policemen knocking on gates of neighbors and relatives.</comment>

<comment>All those incestor lefties shd b sent to siachen naked ....they shd fl the atrocities committed by stalin</comment>

<comment>Well, they don't have the courage, they are basically cowards. Have you not seen the pale face of Comrade Kanhiya Kumar when he was taken into custody. These are the students who get brainwashed and do brainwashed other students for bloody revoultion, they support blood thirsty Naxalites, but not able to face police in Capital of Delhi.</comment>

<comment>The problem with JNU or some other prestigious universities is that they have hard core LEFT teachers, lecturers, professors. Few hot blood students become pray for them and becomes anti Indians</comment>

<comment>JNU is producing and a breading factory for ANTI nationals earlier and now. Media is also in favor of them or do not publish it. Only difference is that Social media and technology exposed these anti nationals now , but not earlier. Do not talk or point to Modi or BJP. If you are an Indian , think about and step in the way how to eradicate these anti nationals out from India.I saw hundred of people shouting Anti national slogans , but only one was arrested.Whats wrong. Arrest them and strip their nationality like the way France got the rule.</comment>

<comment>AISA means Anti-Indian Student association. Kabhi mile tho Ulta latkaake maarenge saalo ko. How dare they shout "Bharat ki barbadi tak jung ladenge".</comment>

<comment>all university should be free from national politics.........like in technical and medical college</comment>

<comment>these are anti modi GANG..............................who even saying pakistan zindabad..........just to opposing modi...and supporting afjal pig, yakub dog, ishrat suicide bomber</comment>

<comment>If they want to oppose Modi on certain issues, it is their right to express it. But just to trouble Modi, they are shouting against India and supporting Afzal/Yakub ! These students are anti-nationals. This is no way called freedom of speech. It needs PUNISHMENT. It is high time the govt passes a law to punish anti-nationals.</comment>

<comment>Apart from exhibiting all the corruption traits from congress, BJP is involving university politics.  I dont remember it happened even in Vajpai rule.  These guys have sunken to such a abyss.  Shame on you BJP.</comment>

<comment>But wat to do eith those papistani sympathiser homo paedophils terrorist in the campus</comment>

<comment>Nothing can be done expect keep eye on them Contain.. If you see UK and france, they also get anti national protests from Muslims all the time. But their police departments are capable of keeping track andcontain. That is disadvantages of having democracy. It is tolerated coz other alternatives are worse than this.</comment>

<comment>Stop comparning UK, France with India..both were colonial power looted money around the world and becuase of That they today able to control people in ther land.india never looted other country to feed its people.so use head before you speak..</comment>

<comment>Hehe...  your comment is very funny.. In fact insult to intelligence of humanity.</comment>

<comment>Yes, if humanity consist of Morons like you.</comment>

<comment>What ever humanity consist... does it matter ? Another insult to intelligence of humanity...</comment>

<comment>Yes, it matters becuase Humanity cannot be same for 2 different thingss.</comment>

<comment>Intelligence of the humanity is unique entity attributed to humans , anything insulting to it will belong to animals category.</comment>

<comment>Please don't compare yourself as animal..:) ..Intelligence itself annd its meaning differ ..when you compared India and UK , france I understood  your Intelligence</comment>

<comment>Again, here we are talking about you .... Just read your own previous  comment, you have said "YES I am an insult to humanity".   Thats what differentiates between you and humanity....</comment>

<comment>if you are Insult to humanity, then my previous comment proves you are animal.if your are animal , you will not have Intelligence.if don't have "Intelligence" then you cannot differentiates.if you cannot differentiates then how can you compare India and other nation..So, that means your comparision is absurd in first place</comment>

<comment>Only problem in your logic is , you have made a wrong assumption. While you have already accepted that you are an Insult material just replace "You" by " I " in your comments. You will get it.</comment>

<comment>Logic works for people who have intelligence, not people on dope ..</comment>

<comment>Even though I hate sectarian politics of BJP but I am absolutely against TRAITORS under the guise of Leftists. People like them need to be kicked out of country or dumped in Bay of Bengal..!</comment>

<comment>What I mean is when such violence happens , police is the right means . Not political parties.</comment>

<comment>In this case only the arrests were done by police only. Then  Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi created politics by opposing the arrests. BJP had no option but to respond</comment>

<comment>JNU is producing and a breading factory for anti nationals earlier and now. Media is also in favor of them or do not publish it. Only difference is that Social media and technology exposed these anti nationals now , but not earlier. Do not talk or point to Modi or BJP. If you are an Indian , think about how to eradicate these anti nationals out from India.</comment>

<comment>26 JAN republic day is celebrated by ANTI NATIONALS as black day can u name such anti nationals and can we see same debate and outrage. why govt didnt take any action</comment>

<comment>No need of any individuals take decision into their hands Nor the political parties.We have institutes like  police department to handle such things.  If they are not sufficient update them or create new one.</comment>

<comment>JNU is well know Breaking India factory. Has not produced single research on uniting the country. Rather all the research will point to social engineering and breaking the country. Get you head straight.</comment>

<comment>Doesnt matter.  India has lots of problems to deal with. Instead of focusing real issues, these incompetents using power to play with kids.  Police are already there in case of any violence. No need of political parties any Uni.  Students are powerless and nothing wrong in having political inclinations.</comment>

<comment>Police made arrests. where is politics in this?</comment>

<comment>It is a black and white case of anti nationals taking over the campus preventing freedom of speech. They need to be booked under the stringent possible law so that the students and faculty focus on the study rather creating ruckus. Politics has no rule to play in this discussion. Simple question to ask is that if these activities were organized by a certain student body or not. If it was and they man handled other students then they must be booked. No questions asked. Do not bring politics into this issue to avoid facts.</comment>

<comment>Do you think these Anti nationals are power less small milk drinking kids? What a dialogue sir ji!You don't have road, house, good dress , good food,  but can survive HAPPILY with what ever you have .But If a bomb is in your pocket and you know that it is going to blow any time, even you have money, house , good food, you can not live happily.If you are right why to spend money on military, Just withdraw all our military.At least Pakistani's  are better than these Anti nationals, they bomb enemy India , not on them self.Any one observed any protest in POK against Pakistan?I never saw any news or videos. But in India, leave the J&K, every Tom and Dick start shouting anti India and pro J&K Muslim ( Not J7K Hindus or Sikhs) words.</comment>

<comment>Who is bothered about political inclination, everyone is free, But under disguise of freedom to express, if you shout "Bharat ki barbadhi tak jung ladenge", then hell with your freedom of expression to harm my country and its men.</comment>

<comment>Ma ch*d do in bh0sad! waalon ki.</comment>

<comment>Traitors and parasites, joined hand with PAK handlers, organized an anti national activity, invited anti national elements, engaged in anti national activity and now lying to escape jail.  Just like PAK does.Eating Indian tax payers money and attending calss of PAK.</comment>

<comment>Wat ever may be the cause but slogans against our nation is not good healthy fight......remember our SOLDIERS who served our nation to save u all......in the same way few men againt the nation il not make the entire religion anti national .......HOPE U REMEMBER Abdul Hamid :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Hamid_(soldier) Sepoy Kansi Ram and many....</comment>

<comment>..JNU is breeding ground for traitors. It should be closed down. Indians cannot fund JNU to self destruct themselves. Anyone who talks about destroying india on indian soil, must be publicly hanged</comment>

<comment>I want karnataka to liberate . i am not a product of jnu . not a muslim . not a christian . tjere are millions like me in all states . </comment>

<comment>I want Police to liberate you of your sorry existence. You should better die and become manure instead of crapping here. Share your mobile number traitor. I will ask Police to help you out.</comment>

<comment>You are disgrace to humanity, I am true kannadiga, Meet me personally, dont hide behind the social media you coward.</comment>

<comment>He's a mullah or xtian in hiding, ignore such worthless trolls..</comment>

<comment>First ask your your mother for her opening and go back into hers,, make a protest,saying until Karnataka is liberated then  only I will not come out.</comment>

<comment>Just remove this comment pls.</comment>

<comment>Universities should be politics free.....Like Research Institute.......Political parties are feeding young generation with worst politics and making their successor.....It should be banned in every education system....</comment>

<comment>Spare us the ranting of Muslims, Sickulars and Leftists - the traitors should be whipped in public so that budding traitors posing around as students can be discouraged !</comment>

<comment>liberalism and freedom of expression does not mean u have got licence to insult the country where ur living, eating and doing everything else.</comment>
