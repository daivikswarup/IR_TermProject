<comment>What has BJP got to say about this?</comment>

<comment>again congress face book...firstpost propaganda....if this is really victory ruling party in state...congress decline already started in karnataka</comment>

<comment>If that's lion share what modi won in 2014 elections was billion lions share lol</comment>

<comment>I know! marginally ahead despite the entire state machinery at its disposal. That is a dismal sign of things to come ahead for them. They should have swept this election, much like the BMC, Lok Sabha, assembly by-elections, but so far Sidd has been a flop</comment>

<comment>If this is Lion's share...then the lion wud have been dead long back...Gr8 work siddu..jai tipuji...!!!</comment>

<comment>Soooo the Congress with all of the state machinery behind it could not secure a majority in these local body polls. Has Siddamariah done anything for the Congress in Karnataka - disappointing show in BMC, by elections, Lok Sabha even MLC falling short of expectations </comment>

<comment>Prophet Mohammed fukked pigs as young as 6 years old. He named one of them aisha </comment>

<comment>Pedo followers have increased in Karnataka, it's evident in the election result </comment>

<comment>AAPholes commies,prestitutes and mullas are celebrating as if their world has changed.Apply burnol for more years to come </comment>

<comment>This news was not covered in media. Only the elections where BJP wins is covered in media. And the chaddis always cry hoarse that MSM is against them LOL.</comment>

<comment>It is covered or else why would we be commenting here </comment>

<comment>What are you commenting on?  Congi website?  Municipality elections get only so much...</comment>

<comment>Where are Modi fanboys and cheer-girls to defend him and the BJP?Modi's dream of "Congress Mukt Bharat" is in tatters.</comment>

<comment>Some local elections who cares after Assam and Kerala. Karnataka will be the only place Congress is left which needs to Continue as Karnataka is a jinxed state who ever wins Karnataka looses nationally.  </comment>

<comment>Its a dream that will hopefully come to fruition. There are going to be losses along the way...</comment>

<comment>The ruling part is not as way ahead as the headline suggests. Ruling parties mostly win local elections by large margins. When they dont, its a huge sign of change.Congress can forget Karnataka once elections set in.</comment>

<comment>His point was about Cong mukt bharat. As usual, chaddis have no brains to understand a point being made.</comment>

<comment>Ruling party in Karnataka is congress you nincompoop.</comment>

<comment>God bless you chaddi. You are still not getting it.</comment>

<comment>Hahahaha  bogus  secularism  and khujli  lies prevailing  in mental  beggar's brain you  won't  need  MRI in any case </comment>
