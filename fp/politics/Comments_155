<comment>Technology is just a tool. The people have to become aware of the real issues like jobs and development. Sadly we use it more for fighting and abusing.</comment>

<comment>In my religion, you have to stand on one foot and bray like a donkey while making fart noises under your arm. If you don't do it, we stone you to death. :P</comment>

<comment>Dont show your hate for Hinduism by posting stupid comments....That one legged posture is one of the mudras in AshtaYoga and is influenced by Shiva's one legged dance or the Nataraj avatar. If you can't respect atleast don't make fun.</comment>

<comment>oops there was a posture like this?i only meant a sarcastic joke against people who kill in the name of religion.i meant no hate to any religions and i apologize if it hurt someone .</comment>

<comment>how's ur poork sandwich?</comment>

<comment>yeah! cool isn't it?</comment>

<comment>yeahhcool isn't it?</comment>

<comment>Muslims in any case will not vote for BJP.BJP will win on tha back of majority hindu votes</comment>

<comment>Owaisi k bhadkau bhaashan dekhte hai yeh aur khush hote hai hinduon ki baare mei galat sunn k </comment>

<comment>What is "bhadkau"?</comment>

<comment>Katju kitni achhi baat bolta hai. Main muslims ke mohalle  mein bhee pork bechna chahta hoon. Dekhta hoon kaun rok sakta hai mujhe.Until we respect the other's feelings do not expect other people to appreciate your feelings.</comment>

<comment>This is how t3rr0 rists network.</comment>

<comment>Giving technology to the undeserved will only make them bold in implementing Sharia later.</comment>

<comment>This guy - Tarique Anwar knows to write something very specific to muslims. He can never think beyond his community. But this blaggard calls others as communal.</comment>

<comment>when  I see a muslim in india following arab wear gear blindly shows they've developed as slave  mentality. muslim in india all hindu  convert should act and feel free and do what  they  like not follow a sheep mentality ,  skull cap ,hijab is not required in free nation  Grow up..</comment>

<comment>Grow Up? Sheep Mentality?? Didn't get you? Let me explain you dear brother that Christianity and Islam are global religions, And bcoz Hinduism in only in India, or took birth in India, and is not a global religion, we feel everyone should be like us. Rightly said, India is a free nation, so be free and let others be free, from our/your compulsion and mandate on what to wear and whom to follow..And by the way brother Muslim wearing a skull cap/hijab/burqa is not Arab mentality, its Islamic teachings, same as Sikh wearing a pugg/bandana or christian father/nun wearing traditional does not make him slave of the west, its Christianity....What ever way a Muslim friend of yours live, dont judge him until and unless he harms you in some way or the other., by the way if you see a usual happy go lucky kind muslim turning into wearing a skull cap, that means he has now gathered more knowledge of Islamic teachings and now start respecting you much more than before and you will find him more down to earth and more wisdom-ed and well natured than before., bcoz that's the way Islam teaches, to behave with our neighbors and people with other religions. Be good, take care dear brother.</comment>

<comment>You must be really Ugly. </comment>

<comment>What a communal post this is... And then morons like this author blame RSS...On one hand they talk about secularism and on other hand they vote as a community to anyone who supports Iftar parties and beef parties...Shame..</comment>

<comment>i'll definitely support beef parties :P</comment>

<comment>Your mother is a FAT cow, go chew on her Clit. </comment>

<comment>no need i just fried you mother and ATE her :p</comment>

<comment>would love if local channel telecast sext tapes of nuns and fathers:p</comment>

<comment>Oooh cmon! you coldly come up with something mature enough? really bad comeback. i just ate your god with extra spicy ...it was so tasty :p</comment>

<comment>Cow isn't God. It's considered sacred,  fwckwit.  Like your ugly mom's twat, which you can't eat but I  can ride her till the cows come home!    :D</comment>

<comment>Awesome, lets have a beef party and fart in the name of jesus</comment>

<comment>In my religion, you have to stand on one foot and bray like a donkey while making fart noises under your arm. If you don't do it, we stone you to death.</comment>

<comment>Dats the coolest religion bro, in ours we just smoke weed and chill</comment>

<comment>maybe you should try this</comment>

<comment>We have become spineless...despite of so many traitors like this author and several eminent journalists openly engaging in blasphemy, we sit like lame ducks and do nothing...Such traitors in other countries would be summarily executed. Shame on us.</comment>

<comment>That's no surprise, connectivity and smartphones have made it possible for even people in the remotest places to know the news as they come. Of course that is why secular media at the outset of every election made a controversy of every possible thing that can make BJP look bad. Anyway, knowledge is power and if the people, regardless of their faith use it, they will soon be better off.</comment>

<comment>Is it just India which has so many number of traitors? Just recall history, every war we lost due to traitors.. from panipat to bastar to 1857 to 1962..and still going on.. :(</comment>

<comment>Disqus must definitely implement a feature that prevents a person from being able to upvote his own comment. Disqus probably did not realize that there too many insecure people who are craving approval (i.e. upvotes) that they will upvote their own comments.</comment>

<comment>How do you know dude, where u a gay prisoner there</comment>

<comment>Hahaha </comment>

<comment>You know good amount of bad words.. unfortunately Brahmans didn't tell anyone to dropout from schools and not take higher studies.. India was ruled by so called secular , lower caste loving party and leaders.. why didn't they do anything for poor.. why PM has to talk and build toilets after 67 years of independence?Expecting extraordinarily stupid argument from you now ;)</comment>

<comment>What stopped you from saying "young Indians" in the story instead of saying young Muslims?I am sure youngsters of all other religions too must be using Facebook.</comment>

<comment>anwar sab MY factor ke M par concentrate kar rahe hain :)</comment>

<comment>Bhaijan, Equally you should write how young Hindus (please don't divide us into bhumihars, yadavs, brahmins, dalits etc) are using Facebook too. In fact its better if you donot use this jargon of Muslims and others. Most of muslims of course vote for the secular parties, tell me if there is change and muslim voting along the majority.</comment>

<comment>All parties are playing communal lines. but when some body says hindu, that is non secular. Why ??? RJD is highly communal as it is surviving on vote bank mathematics and not on issue. Nitish joined hands with RJD and congress which is known for communal dirty politics. Then BJP is secular party as it is basing on issue based development.</comment>

<comment>Friends defeat  Modi in Bihar, this guy has turned India to a laughing stock. He has blockaded a neighbor showing his displeasure against the constitution adopted by democratically elected assembly. Read Nepali papers online, country is in crisis just before Dusserah. Modi has not only failed to protect minorities, he has created havoc in the neighborhood.</comment>

<comment>Nepal's problem is not Modi or India but China and Pakistan and if you are a true Nepali you should be worried about that...in the next 100 years both China and Pakistan will gobble up Nepal....all the seeds of this unrest have been sown by them both.So Wake Up Bro and smell the Coffee OR should i say RAKSHI.</comment>

<comment>Are you a Nepali?</comment>

<comment>Sometimes when your small brother plays truant you tend to twist arms , it doesnt mean you disavow or hate him. Similarly when interests of section of population is not served by the new constitution, these things bound to happen. Its called diplomacy. And finally I dont see how voting for JDU will solve Nepal crisi</comment>

<comment>After 8 years of hard negotiations they came up with a formula, that may not be perfect but constitution respects one man one vote and equal rights for all. There are some biases against women which need to be addressed, but there are no biases against Madhesis. Main demand that is difficult to address now is "half of the Terai region should be made one STATE". And you know how many votes Modi's allies won? 12% in the last election for constitution assembly. Modi has alligned with them and blockaded cooking gas and petroleum products to the whole nation. What sort of arm twisting is this?</comment>

<comment>Hey, let me say something. The truck drivers are part of trade unions and they are not government employees. The vendors are standing near your border with good but tension is preventing them form entering. And you can neither blame Indian Border Security Forces for enhancing the checking. Bihar and UP are known to be notorious state in India. Do you have any idea about what will happen if these lorries bring guns and other materials to support protesters. We can't completely rule out this due to ethnic closeness they share with protesters. Even inflammable material can be misused if they get abducted. Your Ambassador says that Nepal Army will protect drivers. But I can't get one things, your government can take over responsibility of logistics from Indian government and move good in War footing. Why are they not doing it ? Do you think they don't know about it ? Stop blaming India. The problem is in your country</comment>

<comment>Shut up u son of a randddiii</comment>

<comment>Nepalis are ruled by Sickulars & we know its parallel story of India (that we already had during our independence), Match fixing between sickulars of both the countries are the main reasons. Teri & Madhesis are suffering more than the sickulars from that region. Its Hum Saath Saath Hain story. If people who are not interested to see Govt of India & new Govt. in Bihar, the best way is have a one way ticket to Pakistan for free XXXAli shows :-) as a token of Sickularism</comment>

<comment>Yes my dear by making a thief win</comment>

<comment>The only thing they are alert to are Islamic apps shouting allah's name and the only thing they r connected to is ISIS accounts on twitter.</comment>

<comment>You are thoroughly WRONG ...</comment>

<comment>He is right bro</comment>

<comment>Remove the spectacle of hatred from your eyes, you will be able to see the reality, which is common for all of us ...</comment>

<comment>if i remove spectacle sickulars will throw mirchi powder in my eyes </comment>

<comment>So, the "sickulars" are haunting and conditioning you and you are agreeing that you look at the reality through a coloured glass ...</comment>

<comment>Whom to vote is decided by muslims in mosque , christians in church and hindus in social media.</comment>

<comment>Tarique anwar saab is highlighting Digital India, same thing his prestitute friend r@ndipan sharma was opposing tooth and nail. </comment>

<comment>you are absolutely right .... Shame on hindus !!</comment>

<comment>Dear Sickular Moron, why are communalizing by writing only about Sickulars? In Bihar, other than young Muslims, haven't you seen young Indians using facebook? How much you have influenced them in the pretext of your reporting activities?</comment>

<comment>It also reveals that Muslim mindsets have not changed one little bit even in the younger generation, despite they being allegedly tech-savvy ! Katju is great because he mocks Hindus by proclaiming his love for beef. Exactly as the previous generation thought Mulla M was 'bhery sekular' because he ordered firing at unarmed Hindus in 1989 ! The poison in their head remains !</comment>

<comment>WELL SAID BROTHER.Hindus are to be blamed for their plight today.</comment>

<comment>Other religions think about implementing what is said in Bible and Quran  They do any thing to spread their religion.We have understood it very late.See the madness what is going on in Syria and other middle east countries within the Abraham cult.Now people of this country should understand who are communal forces People should make the difference between patriotic leaders and communal leaders.Even our leaders unfortunately do not make such difference in the context of global threat to protect the nation from these forces..</comment>

<comment>see what russians are doing to isis now? these rss are like isis</comment>

<comment>"We observe every comment carefully and identify those voters who have reservations. If they are voters of our constituency, we arrange their cell phone number and personally call them to convince him".And if they do not still get convinced through conversation, there are probably many other ways to convince them.</comment>

<comment>They like Owaisi and not ISIS?? Kidding me?? Are they different? Both are hatemongers and anti Hindu and terror sympathisers.</comment>
