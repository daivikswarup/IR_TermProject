<comment>No country in the world has such large number of seditionists celebrating usurping an elected lower house ......Like the president of the US, we forgot to give the elected PM the casting Vote or a VETO....I suppose in the larger scheme of things we are a very YOUNG democracy ....may be 3 more generations post independence .....we might become mature ....we are still in the process of celebrating our white queen Sonia Mata ...Tyag moorti</comment>

<comment>that the same thing done by BJP when it was oppsition, what BJp did earlier in parliament,now its getting its own taste now</comment>

<comment>A youngster taking his own life is really tragic. But how is the government in Delhi responsible for it? The congress wanting to use this to stall parliament shows its moral bankruptcy. The party knows nothing better than living off dead people.</comment>

<comment>Just like the Feku lived off the corpses be it in Godhra, or across gujarat or like in Ishrat Jahan or in the case of Mumbai attacks. Corpse eating vulture would be hard pressed to find a better icon than the supreme leader.</comment>

<comment>If YOU have evidence GIVE it to courts ...brainless prejudiced hate filled MORON.....congress desh drohis and their admirers like YOU had 13 years ....WTF were you LOT doing???? ....why dont you recommend Teesta Setavad for the post, leader of desh drohis who want to convict an elected PM .....? has any thing worked YET? because hate driven fantasies dont ever work ....like the Paki army ...they stole the tents sent by ordinary people to earth quake victims .....cause and effect...... MY FOOT ....if that alone worked you would have been hit by that meteorite than that poor victim from TN..... dont care where YOU live</comment>

<comment>I like it when sanghis lose whatever minimum brains they have. Desh Drohi... what were you doing in 1947, 1965, 1984...What was I doing before birth..do you have evidence? courts are the ultimate decision makers..and then subvert the courts too...Jai Hind.. Vande Mataram...Bharat Mata ki Jai.</comment>

<comment>My foot ......GO and FLY a kite ....people who are deluded like you are in every street corner and keep multiplying .....What ever YOU scumbag are ....you are NOT ALBERT EINSTEIN ......NOR Charles Darwin...so quietly PERISH .....Bharat Mata will celebrate......</comment>

<comment>ROFL. I was wondering where the customary mention about Bharat Mata is. Here it is. She will celebrate for sure.She will celebrate the day you guys are dumped into oblivion.</comment>

<comment>Desh k paiso ko udane k liye ready ho jaao ...budget ke alava kuch hone vala to he nahi is session me..:))</comment>

<comment>Indian Banks are collapsing. India is a failed state. Only democratic[free capitalist] nations survive=========================================A)MODI SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS TO TOUGH AND DO REQUIRED BLOOD SHED IF REQUIRED. From Amrut Manthan story: Along with amrut of development the worst poison halahala also emerges. Hard working people SHOULD get amrut and lazy people SHOULD get halahala. One can only minimize the effect of halahala but cannot eliminate it. First and foremost one needs to ban communist parties as they are for single party dictatorship and encourage various strife in order create unrest, so that they can impose their dictatorship. As George Orwell puts it:" One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safe guard a revolution, One does a revolution in order to establish a dictatorship".B)Now BJP/RSS should bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit====================================================Is India is a democracy? It is a Joke on democracy! Voting is not sufficient to call India a democracy - the crucial thing is protection of Individual rights, because INDIVIDUAL is the smallest minority1) In which country whole cities are brought to a halt by Bandhs? Bandhs is the murder of funfamental right of movement. All parties practice Gherao - even kidnapping is OK?2)Trains are burnt to PROVE that ones caste is a backward castes.3)There are three kinds of rule, Tyranny, ocholocracy and democracy.For the same reason a nation which is cannibalistic (which eats human flesh) cannot be democratic, India which murders merit by reservation policy CANNOT be democratic. The Only work in a democracy for a government is protection of Individual right - Jefferson. Merit is the highest Individual right.India is a Ocholocracy [rule by the mob, example reservation policy; casteism is also communalism and of a worse kind as stable vote banks are formed - which has led to emancipation from democracy of political parties and state] led by the mafia[till recently we had a genuine Italian one]. IT IS A SHAME TO CALL INDIA A DEMOCRACY.4)Socialism introduced into constitution during emergency has ensured that Indians elect their OWNERS rather than rulers as most of factories are public sector.5)If communists are a spent force why dont you remove socialism from constitution which was introduced during single party dictatorship of emergency. Communists are not spent force. Proof? The intolerance controversy was stoked up by joint politburo meeting of communist parties around Aug/Sept/Oct 2015. Vapayee himself was a Socialist - "Gandhian Socialist". Communist want to force governments which are non-socialist to debauch their currency, family relations in criminality[marital rape], reverse industialization[reds turning green], support murder of merit by reservation policy and they back socialism which is legal robbery.</comment>

<comment>Burn down the parliament...</comment>

<comment>so they are going to stall it again , so why ready , u just turn up and shout and stop proceedings</comment>

<comment>are you surprised?? did you expect anything else?</comment>

<comment>Just like Arun Jaitley and Sushmaji.</comment>

<comment>what about them ? did they stall the parliament . never heard they did , it was a sickular stall of the parliament all these days</comment>

<comment>Sachaayeehas a habit of keeping the head in the sands then.. now.. and forever.</comment>

<comment>on the contrary u are busy trying to hide a whole pumpkin in a smaller plate of rice .L ok sabha passed maximum bills in say more than 10 years last year and RS stalled maximum times last year in the last 68 , thanks to the sickular chutes of  in RS . just because u get personal does not mean u are right</comment>

<comment>LS sabha distrupted the maximum times by the honorable BJP during 2009-14. Why? Inspite of invitation for discussion on various issues Jaitley and Sushma were more concerned about bail for Shah Ji.You think you are the only one with numbers. Go and ask your paymasters to teach you something else.</comment>

<comment>lol , for what purpose , for 3.5 lakh crore loot roughly 80 billion dollars and the same was proved , nowongis disrupted for what , -to protect the gandhis  from national herald ( amount nearly 2000 crores ) bail for shah ji lol - hardly up for discussion , the commies and congis disrupted the RS and did not pass bills which were important for India - well as a sickular antinational u are not worried , jaitley is soon going to be richer by another 10 crores - all from aap</comment>

<comment>And for inflating the figures you have awarded Vinod Rai a padma.And the same CAG reports have been consigned to dust bin when it pointed fingers at Gujarat Government. Jaitley is going to be ripped off his ministry soon for all you know.</comment>

<comment>Congress and Rahul if you are really serious against corruption come up with a bill to enact law which Debars criminals and tainted criminals to contest any elected post . Politicians irrespective of party affiliation are the worst law breakers. Stop blame game and obstruction politics.Court needs evidence to convict politicians wants us to believe what they say" . Create a system . Blaming others does not provide you a clean chit. Most of times you are dirtier than the person you are accusing .</comment>

<comment>The Congress party must arrange for a payment of Rupees seven crores as compensation for the Rohit Vemula Family, especially his mother.  They should otherwise keep their trap shut instead of playing political volley ball.  The entire Nehru dynasty appears to be insincere in the way they deal with the Indian population and the list includes Indra, Sanjay  Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia, Rahul, Maneka, Varun and Priyanka Gandhis. Please note that  Maneka and Varun Gandhi also operate on the same lines even though they belong to the BJP.  After Motilal and Jawaharlal, the dynasty is full of politically motivated and power mad frauds.</comment>

<comment>Modi should work for the country as he is doing currently. 2019 will take care of itself. Winning and losing of any party is secondary. Development of country should be the first priority.</comment>

<comment>Pre$$titutes , AAPtards and Dumbressis think they have won 2019. Your anti modi itch has become a case of severe piles and you can't see things in front of you.Modi is here to stay.

<comment>did he? shah was elected unopposed. so much for skin of teetyh, do you even know what the expression means, or just spraying liberally whatever expression you knowthey had enough of state politics in their life. by your logic pappu should go back to municipality as he won only 44. he is still aroundcommon sense helps sometimes</comment>

<comment>Brokers and Jokers Party.</comment>

<comment>The Budget session is most likely to end in another wash out !!The single majority status in Lok Sabha has gone into this Govt's head and its dogmatic approach has been "my way or high way".  The head of this Govt., is not a man of consensus but one of confrontation and is always in a street fight mode !!</comment>

<comment>Before the last session, the PM said and did all the right things. What was the reaction of the Congress in parliament after that? Stop spreading lies.</comment>

<comment>The PM speaks in different voices. He talks one thing in Parliament and immediately contradicts that in a public platform.  He behaves like a man overcome by fits and rages breathing fire many times.  He is identified by many faces and his motormouth spews inanities most of the times with exceptions.  So the problem is his lack of consistency to be dignified as it is difficult to straighten's dog's tail bestowed by Nature's gift !!</comment>

<comment>so make fake up votes</comment>

<comment>Just like supreme leaders number of followers in Twitter.</comment>

<comment>why should Modi beg to Sonia and gang.....let GST rot....anyway common man are not going to gain imediately...so Modiji enjoy....</comment>

<comment>modi better serve chai like last time and ask for a pardon</comment>

<comment>If Congress holds on the Rohit's suicide as dalit atrocities, it would be idiotic and a blunder. This guy is a fake dalit and it is not a caste war either. Pure politics.</comment>

<comment>People know what is the truth. You will see it in UP. And then the likes of you will shut up.</comment>

<comment>Modi is right in saying that criminal corrupt communal cancer congis cant digest their humiliating defeat. Shame on these criminals. Hope in next election, congis don't get even four berths.</comment>

<comment>Lol. Keep your hopes with BJP. Let congress and AAP find their own way. btw how is your 60 Lakh Rental Laptop Finance Minister doing? I hear he is going to get the Nobel Prize for economics?</comment>

<comment>True 'Cause & Effect'.... keep up ur mine up...</comment>

<comment>Let it be proved. Mere accusations will not wash. They have to be proved. Kejri is already shitting in his pants , now that Delhi High Court has rejected his petition against the defamation case. If the SC rules in Jaitley's favour, then it is curtains for Kejriwal. Either he has to apologise shamelessly as he did to Gadkari or bow out of office , only to be replaced by anothet AAP joker !!</comment>

<comment>Yes we saw the proof in the pudding that was eaten by jaitleys daughter. By the time Supreme Court arrives CBI and faithful like Jung would have cleansed the dung.</comment>

<comment>My dear friend ,you and me do not matter in the whole episode. What matters is whether Delhi CM has enough proof to nail Jaitley. If he has then suffice it to say that the Hon'ble court will take cognizance of the proof , determine its veracity and decide the case , either way.Did Mr. Kejriwal not know he had proof or not when he was making those accusations. What Kejriwal does is , utter in haste and repent in leisure !If his proof was iron cast , then what was the necessity to rush to Delhi HC with a plea to quash the case ! Here itself, it is evident enough how'solid ' Kejriwal's proof is ! Till then we can call it a truce and oopen another front when the court decides the matter.</comment>

<comment>Why you want to call it a truce?Isn't it true that under Jaitley DDCA rented laptops at the rate of 16,000 per day?Isnt it true that CBI raid was a operation aimed at destroying the evidence against jailtey?You and your truce. NonsenseThe country went from corrupt dogs to corrupt and rabid dogs.</comment>

<comment>I am amused by your reply. You haven't got my point and comprehended it. When I said,' lets call it  a truce' I meant truce between u and me , not between Jaitley and Kejriwal. We are just ordinary mortals , who haplessly watch when two mighty elephants fight. Both of them are locked in a bitter battle and the matter has reached the Court. Let the court decide on the basis of available evidence. But isn't it a fact that Kejriwal shoots off his mouth , only to land in trouble later. He is a CM . His responses and utterances should be measured and restrained.That's what I meant !!</comment>

<comment>next election 2019 be ready for 44 to 4 khongressi,thats the only answer cuntry have for u</comment>

<comment>update your knowledge first. Congress now has 45 MPs in Lok Sabha. They recently snatched one from BJP in Madhya Pradesh bypoll.</comment>

<comment>wrong bro....there are 4 more of PAAP- Punjab unit....now you must be feeling  better...</comment>

<comment>by that logic, you can add MIMs tally to BJP as well. I am feeling better because i always knew that Mr Modi was fooling people and now people across the country have started realising that.</comment>

<comment>u snatched my words...</comment>

<comment>In simple words Congress vermin will flush the country down the toilet to prove their loyalty to the Gandhis.</comment>

<comment>loyalty to the Ga ndus</comment>

<comment>So whats New ? they behave in the similar fashion every time.. scouting for non-reasons to stall parliament</comment>

<comment>they learnt it from BJP which stalled parliament for years for similar "non-reasons".</comment>

<comment>Maulanji it was 2 years out of 10 and only Zombies like u can consider CWG , coal, 2G scam etc to be non reasons</comment>

<comment>dear dumbhakth, not everyone who opposes BJP is a maulana. Still not learnt any lessons from Bihar and Delhi?BJP blocked GST since 2011 and many more bills before that, including the insurance bill, which btw was passed after it came to power, with the support of Congress.</comment>

<comment>may be not every one ...some are AAPIGS, ..just as not everyone supporting this govt is bhakt dumb or otherwise..bt ur a maulanaand read some news instead of propaganda.. a number of states (even congee ruled like kerala and MAh) had some objections to GST till 2013 which Jailtley has tried to address and PC did not.. and congress has stalled more than supported so don't give ur BS... and retard I don't have to learn anything.. i am not a political party</comment>

<comment>even today a number of states, including those ruled by BJP states, have objections to GST. Not supporting Congress but BJP has stalled most number of bills while in opposition, Congress is just copying it. PC also tried to address and Jaitley instead of addressing 3 concerns of Congress is doing politics about it. Guess who the retard is here.</comment>

<comment>No guessing you are the RETARD here,  during its height of opposition BJP helped pass,  land bill,  FSA and andhra bifurcation. .so issue not addressed not supported. .and unlike NDA,  UPA had majority in both houses and they really didn't NEED BJP ..but why waste time with a hater retarded suvar (self up voting aap rascals)</comment>

<comment>BJP had no option but to pass land bill and FSA. As for Andhra bifurcation, both Congress and BJP had joined hands to bifurcate the state in the most partisan manner. It is 19 months since BJP came to power and they have not yet fulfilled the promises made by them and Congress to AP.Update your knowledge buddy. UPA did not have majority in RS. Nice language, shows that you have nothing logical to say. Typical dumbhakth.</comment>

<comment>Not the majority it has now in RS to scuttle every thing?  Left has been supporting UPA in every thing except FDI ..typical zombie -mulla ji twisting things and lying to suit your narrative ..so when bjp helps it has no alternative ..gajjab !</comment>

<comment>it did not have the majority then. If you do not know how Rajya Sabha members are elected, what are their tenures, please learn. Please show me a single point which is a lie. Just because you are ignorant and dont know a thing does not mean facts become lies.</comment>

<comment>Chal chal maulana  kahi aur ja ke bakwaas kar. .jhoot bolne ki limit to tu kab ka cross kar gaya. .no point wasting time with rabid haters</comment>

<comment>once again back to Maulana tactics when you do not have facts to defend. Do they teach this to you?</comment>

<comment> 1) I always said u r a rabid maulana no coming back to it2) you won't know truth if it came and bit you in ur sorry @$$  as I have been writing truth and u r doing what abouterySo eff off ..lie somewhere else</comment>

<comment>i feel so sorry for you, educated but still not able to use your mind independently. If you take out a dictionary and look for the words rabid and hater, you will find that the leader you are so blindly trying to defend fits the bill perfectly. You dont know that Congress did not have majority in RS during UPA, you do not know about GST and you claim to be writing the truth. As i said before, try to show a single statement of mine which is false. And btw, i am a proud Hindu and going by your language, a better one too.</comment>

<comment>Go away HATER</comment>

<comment>The action to be taken against the disruptors should be such that, henceforth , any  MP( of any party ) should think  twice before venturing to disrupt the house. Congress Jokers like Mani Iyer, Jairam, Hanmanth Rao, Subbirami Reddy, Chiranjivi,  Ambika Soni, et al , should be given the boot ( literally) if they start disruptions !!</comment>

<comment>BJP jokers also disrupted the parliament same way when they were in opposition. If you dont know, find out.</comment>

<comment>So what ? There were enough issues during UPA II that affected the nation's prestiege. The reasons Congis are disrupting is for insignificant reasons and manufactured atmosphere of intolerance. You are an idiot  if you point out that BJP did it, so the Congis do it. I am all game if the Congis can show a single policy decisions  of the NDA that have caused financial loss to the exchequer. Without knowing the real reasons , bootlickers of the dynasty need not bark like mad dogs !</comment>

<comment>dont bring up the nation's prestige issue. BJP has also damaged the nation's prestige enough. Slaves of a party should stop assigning names to others. I am not supporting the bad deeds of Congress, you are supporting BJP's bad deeds. Just check the news regularly and you will have enough data against BJP, including the J&K road project scam, which is the latest.</comment>

<comment>It seems you are the guy who is blind as a bat.I have had the advantage of watching the performance of decade old  UPA i & II  over the years as well as the NDA /BJP  for the past almost two years. There is a sea change in administration  now and the BJP/NDA one is more responsive performing and corruption-less. I am not really able to gauge where you are getting the sniff of corruption from except in your imagination. You may not care about the nations prestige but I do and it is certainly high since May 2014. If you are telling me that this was the same during 2004-14 , then that would be the biggest joke of the year. We all know how the nation paid  under Manmohan's stint as a PM and how 'Madame' was pulling the strings. I did not say this but two authors of books have said this. The problem with Congi fans is that they fail to see the reality and are stuck in a time warp, which you certainly are.I humbly beseech you to come out of your closet and smell the fresh coffee outside. Believe me , you will be a better person !!</comment>

<comment>you are not the only one who has watched performance of previous govts and present one. I have watched what happened in Gujarat too. Corruption-less? where in the word did you get the idea that corruption has decreased? Read this report.thehindu(dot)com/business/Industry/not-paying-bribes-in-india-is-a-competitive-disadvantage/article8172647.eceI am not supporting Congress here but pointing out that Mr Modi-led govt is as bad as that of Congress. I also humbly ask you to remove your head from wherever it is stuck now and start thinking on your own. Be more loyal to the country than to a party or leader.</comment>

<comment>Earlier NDA stopped the parliament during the dummy Manmohan days.  Now this so-called Gandi family and Kejriwals stop Mr Modi's government. Politicians lack the class & respect, hence.</comment>

<comment>don't make completely generalised statements.. UPA ruled for 10 years... 8 of those were pretty event free.. its only in the last 2 years with all those huge scams which congees were trying to show as ZERO LOSS.. that bjp upped the ante... this govt didn't even complete 1 year b4 congees started stalling</comment>

<comment>lets troll all bjp bakts with unity ..how is my plan ????/...........................</comment>

<comment>Why changed d profile ? Got banned ?</comment>

<comment>no i il rename myself soon after :) trolling few peoples :) :) n give them stunner :)</comment>

<comment>NDA should not be cowed down by the disruptionist  tactics of the Congress.Just like a flame, that flickers vigorously before it actually extinguishes, the Congress is also doing the same. Instead of helping the govt to pass the bills and earning goodwill for itself ,it is indulging in needless  theatrics and street politics. So be it. What it needs is a good kick in the butt, and the BJP should not shy away from giving the same to the Congress. We have had enough of these lecherous and venal  Congi politicians. It was a now or never for GST during the current tenure of the NDA. Even if the GST bill is passed in the budget session, its implementation is in doubt even from 1-04-2017 onwards ! Recognising this, the BJP should take off its velvet glove and unfold its iron fist and give it to those disruptionists , a sledgehammer blow ! wherever possible !!!</comment>

<comment>Good move by congress. By doing this they are digging their own grave and getting people ready to throw out people like Global godhra. He would be chased away to Porkistan.</comment>

<comment>Godhra 2002 was premeditated circus of heinous crime one cant expect by muzzie congi MLAs + local body corporators. Sonia Ga ndu knew it. But via international ploy of anti-India-Hindu strategy by Abrahamic criminals with support of US - ISI, USCIRF, it was one sided highlighted of atrocities on imagined Muslims but totally suppressed Hindu carnage. Same way, these international Abrahamic criminals allude - only Muslim majority State in India but never talk of muzzie crimes against Kashmiri Hindus. This is d criminal mindset of these two major Abrahamic fake cults.</comment>

<comment>good move by congressmodi should again beg to sonia</comment>

<comment>So begging to Sonia is what our PM should do to get any bill passed?</comment>

<comment>so make fake up votes, you clearly work for congress</comment>

<comment>Seems like this has becoma paki post, now I feel better.</comment>

<comment>moh mein mad 4 fuqqqing four here n seventy two there....</comment>

<comment>Yes we the country of beggars should supprt beggar making congress company</comment>

<comment>No problems. We are not bothered that Congress is doing the dhobi in washing out sessions.You will get it with interest in 2019</comment>

<comment>What is funny is that Congress will not allow passing of bills based on the matters which have nothing to do with the bills. The bills may help India is a secondary thing.</comment>

<comment>ditto for what BJP did while in opposition. It also stalled bills, including GST.</comment>

<comment>If you were awake when BJP started opposing bills, then you would have known the difference. BJP started doing it when multiple (not one) corruption cases involving thousands of crores surfaced and no doubt left that the government will not do anything. Congress is just hoping and waiting for corruption cases to come out.Regarding Lalit Gate scam, kindly enlighten us how much public money has been siphoned off there. People like you will keep on supporting Congress even if it stops all the genuine good bills and delay the reforms in bureaucratic processes. And then they say why so many poor people in India!</comment>

<comment>Just because you are supporting corrupt BJP, dont assume others are doing something similar. I am not supprting Congress here. By the way, it was BJP which blocked the "genuine goods bill" since 2011.</comment>

<comment>Did you even read about the difference in situation? If you can use the terms like corrupt BJP when the whole opposition could not find 1 worthy scam, what terms would you use for the previous government? I assumed you are Congress supporter because of your illogical argument of stalling bills (and thereby supporting Congress's thinking) when the government wanted to bring reforms. Please do not say now that Congress was bringing reforms in the previous tenure. With the number and size of the scams happening combined with the inaction, it would seem very odd.</comment>

<comment>what do you mean by worthy scams? You will now differentiate corruption on the basis of who does it and the quantum of money involved? All that the Modi govt has been doing till now has been copying UPA schemes, from Aadhar to insurance bill to GST (which was blocked by BJP since 2011). Its latest u-turn on MNREGA is another proof that the party has no fresh ideas and was also criticising the previous government just for the same of criticising.</comment>

<comment>BJP was fighting against massive corruption, proof is the fact that SC struck down 2G and Coal licenses. But what is the Congress doing now? is it fighting corruption or is it holding the country hostage at the behest of the Gandhi family?. The Congress party is very clear about one thing, THEY HAVE NOTHING TO LOOSE, they are already scrapping the bottom and know it can't get any worse. So the next best thing is to raise a stink and prevent any sort of development till 2019, if they succeed they can paint a bad picture of the BJP and come back to power and reclaim their rights over our country.</comment>

<comment>The corruption cases of BJP will also com out, just wait. UPA1's corruption was unearthed in UPA2 time. Already Lalitgate and the road project scam are the major scams and more will emerge, it is not if but when. if Congress comes back to power in 2019, it will be only because of BJP's failures.</comment>

<comment>There was nothing "scam like" in Lalitgate, the High court said so, please google for more info. If there is a scam going on why isn't the opposition talking about it? are there any cases registered against the scamsters? If you believe there is a scam then why don't you take it up with the concerned authorities? .Instead of "Plain truth" change your handle to "Plain Conspiracy Theory" its much more accurate.</comment>

<comment>ED is still investigating Ms Raje's company for Lalitgate and Ms Swaraj has already accepted that she helped him and that her husband and daughter had financial dealings with him. So, which high court said no scam? First check the facts and then comment. I know what i am writing about.</comment>
