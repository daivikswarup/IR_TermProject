<comment>People's verdict says that Congress does not deserve to be LOP.  Country should completely get rid of dynastic and corrupt Congress to make way  for the emergence of a new national party.</comment>

<comment>Should BJP break the law and break the tradition to succumb to the childish demands of Congress even after Congress received a drubbing in the elections?</comment>

<comment>The title of the new article should have been "Is Congress begging for Leader of Opposition status in spite of lacking minimum required strength in Lok Sabha?"</comment>

<comment>Also the main point to be noted is that even furring congress regime of Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi , since they had absolute majority the way BJP does today, they didn't allow or have any opposition leaders at all. So how is that they are demanding to be in opposition today and that too with not enough number of seats to be in opposition in first place...</comment>

<comment>If Congress don't have numbers they don't have it. This will save money to taxpayers as the leader of opposition enjoys Ministerial Salary and benefits.</comment>

<comment>Dynasty aka Congress have tons of MONEY. Goons have robbed country for most part of miserable existence. Are we allowed to call spade a spade? MediaJi?People have rejected Congress. Modi cannot throw money to Congress, Money is not his or Speaker's.People did not want UPA and does not Dynasty. Why spit on PEOPLES's WISH.</comment>

<comment>Congress should do what they are good at. Buy ten members from the opposition parties like BSP, SP, TMC  etc. etc to name a few. I guess five crores per head would be a good starting point for negotiation. You think I am kidding! Heck, no.</comment>

<comment>If UPA is a pre-poll alliance and UPA together has more than the adequate numbers then why you choose Mallikarjun Kharge as opposition leader. Congress got more seats from Karnataka but UPA got more seats from Kerala.In that case you should change the leader and then apply for the post.</comment>

<comment>In democracy opposition is a must. However, media must stop throwing mud on BJP as they have been doing for many years. I think Rahul could be a better oppostion leader than arrogant and stupid Mamta.</comment>

<comment>Couldn't agree more. Its not the BJP'S fault that the numbers do not add up for the Congress. You do not expect the BJP to throw freebies at Congress, for that would have an opposite effect.</comment>

<comment>This is not for BJP to decide whether the lop post should be given to congress or not. People of india has already decided and they decided to throw this italian party from India. Now speaker of LS must respect the public verdict and run parliament without Lop. </comment>

<comment>People's verdict has to be respected. Congress has been purged by the people of this Country in this Elections and the 44 MPS are the remains of the party.</comment>

<comment>As can be clearly seen from congress party behavior after elections, it is merely interested in politicizing and obstructing and attacking everything, to thwart Modi government from fulfilling its mandate. It has not earned the right to be a opposition and has not proved to be constructive either, so BJP should not facilitate it. BJP has enough headaches and hurdles to manage, it does not need congress around its neck. Congress needs to be finished off, not pampered like Bajpai government did</comment>

<comment>BJP does not have the right to decide on this matter. The people of country already have. If the Speaker truly wants to do her job, all that she has to do, is to respect the voice of the voters who have denied Congress the 55 seats. And Congress should show some self respect and stop begging for the position.</comment>

<comment>Why are you so much scared of an opposition in the Lok Saba? is't something you'r fearing from Congress' becoming principal opposition? and right from now comeon?</comment>

<comment>@Jemi....fearing of congress, you mean the common man....why should he....are you nuts.....infact it's the political parties like congress which is for the people and not vice versa...still congress seems to think like a king and dynasty here is the real issue behind misunderstanding of congress.....looks like it needs some more years to realize its defeat still...they gave been shown huge door but still don't seem to get out of the country themselves...</comment>

<comment>USE YOUR COMMON. NUMBERS DO NOT ADD UP FOR CONGRESS. ARE YOU FOR REAL?</comment>

<comment>Never thought that I would see this day when Congress rats are fighting for a LOP in LS. Enjoy the moment.. Watch Football World Cup with Popcorn and relax folk. Thanks to everyone who made this moment come true.. Hope we see a similar decimation of Congress in 2019 elections also. The Foreign origin Italian RSVP Dynasty Rats are in panic attack over LOP position.. Made my day.. </comment>

<comment>Those who claim gifting LOP to Cong, means giving "voice" to it, eat a crow. Why?For 30yrs Congress never gave LoP to any party. Right from Nehru, whom many siculars hail as apostle of democracy, never bothered to give "Voice" to opposition. Later, in 5,7,8,9 LS also Cong never allowed opposition to get "voice" Dear RajivG also denied LOP to TDP in 1984, though it won 30 MPs (against Indira death sympathy )in a hurricane polls. So, Cong has least morality to talk on "Voice" to opposition.In 2014, Understand People's mandate - they rejected Cong and wished it fall below 10% of seats so as to loos LOP. So let Speaker follow rules and respect mandate. She is not above peoples mandate.Ofcourse when ruling party does mistake or overrides opp parties, they have sufficient avenues including their forever-hired MSM to run mischievous propaganda against Modi Govt.</comment>

<comment>Its not BJP, but the Indian public which denied the position of LOP to congress by giving only 44 seats.</comment>

<comment>You are following me after election I think. Check my comment history, though it is too long. BJP won because of me. :PI write for fun and do not hate or love any party or leader. One day I may oppose Modi for his Ganga Aarti drama and next day I may praise him for his energy and passion.Currently BJP is in govt, so have more accountability. So they are bound to get more criticism for any slip-ups.</comment>

<comment>Have you noticed this - at least once every-three-months, you end up explaining your political stand to somebody new...HaHa!!</comment>

<comment>Yes. Somehow the crowd here don't believe in neutral or rational thinking from broader perspective.</comment>

<comment>Congress while in power did nothing except to loot.  It doesnot matter whether we have opposition or not.  congress does not matter any more. No need for opposition to Congress.Let Congress respect people's sentiments -  they have not even given 10% of LS strength.  May congress keep their cry down.</comment>

<comment>People rejected congress not even as ruling party also as Opposition party. So congress must respect people mandate and should not ask LOP post.</comment>

<comment>Giving the position of LOP to congress party will give it a voice in the parliament. That would be a misstep in eradicating congress from this country. Indians deserve better and more responsible parties. Not a bunch of bandits, scamsters, and oligarchs disguised as leaders of the people and philanthropists.The so called 'educated' folks, the fancy degree wielding folks, in the Congress party are all very arrogant, exceeded only by their greed. Their vision for India is one of perpetual servitude to their oligarchy.</comment>

<comment>Indians' mission is BCB : BRING CONGRESS BACK</comment>

<comment>I think it is BCB  - bhagao congress ko bhagao</comment>

<comment>it is mission of you converted cross bred mlechhas like chris.</comment>

<comment>Congress will be embraced soon by the people of India. It may be down. But will surely strike back</comment>

<comment>How nice there is no tax as yet on dreams like this one .</comment>

<comment>Never be soft on antinationals. Crush them when they are down. Finish them off completely.</comment>

<comment>And the first  to cast out of place is your Narender Modi !that useless fraudulent who is sleeping even after so many days in the PM's bed!!! sty help  God</comment>

<comment>I think BJP should give the LOP role to Congress. Congress is still a formidable force.</comment>

<comment>Better check the dictionary to know what the word "formidable" means.</comment>

<comment>Where is your formidable force where its candidates  lost deposits in 178 constituencies. 38 of its ministers lost deposits. It has zero representation in parliment in around 25 states </comment>

<comment>To my foot. They are pathetic at core. No good for India. You can kiss Raul feet but leave India out from him.</comment>

<comment>We were told by sickular media that Pappu G was going to be our PM in 2014 but looks like Pappu G faile to win even the post of LOP for his party.Shame on news traders.</comment>

<comment>Rahul G has age on his side. He will definitely come back in 2019</comment>

<comment>Come back from where ? From abroad after spending all that money?</comment>

<comment>OLD or YOUNG donkeys make no difference.Once a donkey is always a donkey.</comment>

<comment>I disagree.. Rahul G is a good leader</comment>

<comment>Keep him at your home because majority of people KNOWHE IS A DUMB HEAD.</comment>

<comment>He is getting older much faster than her mother. He is limping.</comment>

<comment>OLDER THAN HER MOTHER!!!???"HER"  means PAPPU is in fact PuPPI female??HA HA HA HA</comment>

<comment>but he don't have a brain on his head!!!</comment>

<comment>For almost 30.5 years, and also when congress was in government on it's own strength, they never extended the courtesy to any other party. How can they expect it from others?</comment>

<comment>Because first time a party with just 31% of mandate has come to power</comment>

<comment>So? It's not the strength of the opposite party that decides your position. What is your position? hmm.. just about 7 seats more than the very regional AIADMK / TMC.</comment>

<comment>What was mandate for Congress in 2004 and 2009?.</comment>

<comment>I agreee with u. I am wrong in the above statement</comment>

<comment>Did Congress gave LOP to TDP during Rajeev gandhi tenure , then why are they begging that role now ?</comment>

<comment>The sovereign voters have delivered resounding verdict that Congress does not deserve even 55 seats to be the recognized opposition. Why tinker with voters' verdict. Parliament functioned from 1950 till 2014 efficiently. The Leaders of opposition were only during 1977 to 1979, 1989 to February 2014. When for 35 years, there was no recognized opposition, did the Congress attempt to amend the laws to confer benefit to the largest group? Why this craze now? It is only a ploy to generate sympathy, and if some undeserving magnanimity is shown by the BJP, then to again go into family way. Politics runs on reciprocity.</comment>

<comment>Congress Mukt Bharat :-p</comment>

<comment>There should be a LoP. But why should it be Congress member? Its a give and take in politics. I am sure BJP will give it if Congress is willing to give something back in return. Like support for important bill in RS etc.</comment>

<comment>At any cost BJP should not give LOP to congress</comment>

<comment>Cong shd get LOP to protect the interests of people who did not vote the ruling party.. Read 69% of the population</comment>

<comment>69% did not for congress.  Dont misinterpret people's mandate. People voted overwhelmingly for bjp and its allies and did not consider it necessary to give congi even the status of opposition.</comment>

<comment>People? or retarded psychphants??? India knows who voted for criminal Modi , it' just the other criminals and wrong doers who did</comment>

<comment>Congress is doomed just like you.</comment>

<comment>Don't tried to spread the "69% Lie" again and again. No matter how many times you shout, it doesn't become true.</comment>

<comment>why Congress??? Why not TMC???</comment>

<comment>Cong is a national party my dear Ranaji</comment>

<comment>National Party??? hahaha got 0 Seats in H.P,Delhi,Gujarat, Goa,Rajasthan...oopsss</comment>

<comment>If you go that way, our Defence Minister/finance minister is a leader who lost badly</comment>

<comment>You missed Andhra and Tamilnadu, their total was grand zero there as well</comment>

<comment>Whats the vote sir sir? over 20% across the nation</comment>

<comment>20%???? hahaha buddy Grow up..BJP won 85-90% of votes in States with majority of population like UP n M.P</comment>

<comment>And, where is that 85-90% coming from?? ECI says BJP got 54% votes in MP and Cong got 35% votes polled.</comment>

<comment>this is from ECI website:BJP {31.0%,171657...INC {19.3%,1069382...BSP {4.1%,22946182}AITC {3.8%,21259681)</comment>

<comment>It does not include BJP alliance votes. NDA got 40% votes. Remember 2004 Cong got just 15 seats more then BJP but still ruled India. So more people rejected BJP argument is wrong and does not have any value.</comment>

<comment>lame stats...u mean to say that with just 12% of more votes from Congress BJP won 4 times the votes that congress got???</comment>

<comment>That's what ECI stats say. What other reliable source u got?</comment>

<comment>u can surf any website for no. of seat distribution state wise...</comment>

<comment>sir, we are talking about vote share not seat share. right frm beginning. that is where ur 85-90% argument falls flat</comment>

<comment>buddy firstly don't call me sir.u can call me buddy,frnd whatever polite u want...Secondly my arguments is still intact according to state wise only If u know about pie charts!!!</comment>

<comment>no i think u need to correct ur statement to Seat share not vote share. BJP has not managed to get 85-90% of the votes anywhere. Seats yes</comment>

<comment>Remember we are living in country ..our election process is majority wins. If you want to interpret in your way then more people rejected Congress then BJP.</comment>

<comment>Okey lets take it seat wise if you say so, even then also BJP is the one with a mandate and has been granted the opportunity to work for 5 years.</comment>

<comment>i never questioned that. i agree fully with u. But it is the first time that a party with just 31% vote share has gained power. So there is 69% of the population not favoring the ruling party</comment>

<comment>These 69% are dumb heads.So they better follow the wise 31%.</comment>

<comment>u say it's the first time but in 2009 congress got just 28.55% of Vote!!!! OOpsssSource:http:// electionindia2014(.)co(.)in(/)general-election-2009-results-analysis/</comment>

<comment>I think i got my facts wrong. Sorry. I concede that I am wrong in that.</comment>

<comment>You were wrong in many things. Understand the people mood and accept that is the way go-ahead. Declining people mandate is disrespecting them and you never ready to learn. There is a possibility for you and you can come back if you respect people mandate and to work for people trust. Instead of saying BJP rejected by 69% so they should not rule the country, will not help you. Work as positive opposition and really work for people then people will give you chance.</comment>

<comment>This Congi party has become a joke. Time to dismiss this gathering called Congress!</comment>

<comment>They did the same mistake after 77. remember how it came back strong in 1980?</comment>

<comment>It came back because of Indira dirty politics. Read the history. Who split the Janta party</comment>

<comment>Nowit is almost 40 years past 1977 and people are smart enough(not the old fools who voted this useless thief party).So forget it.It is the end for SCAMGRESS.</comment>

<comment>and remember they were rejected by people in 2014?</comment>

<comment>Why "LOP" , why not "LOO" (Leader Of Opposition).. is it because it's congress and not BJP.</comment>

<comment>Defence and Finance are so huge portfolios. And they have given both to one person. Just think what will happen..</comment>

<comment>Dear it's Temporary since new Cabinets and Sub Cabinets are in process of emergence..have Some patience!!!</comment>

<comment>Same thing was said to NDA when they were in oppostion. But they didnt be a responsible opposition</comment>

<comment>Buddy don't comment just for the sake of Debate!!!If NDA wasn't a good opposition then why the hell Congress got stuck to 44?? Why NDA is in power???</comment>

<comment>We are very well know how NDA used to boycott parliament at the throwing of a hat when they were in opposition</comment>

<comment>I agree with you  but this kind of atmosphere is created by Congress just before the session. Every session congress used to bring some controversial issue so that opposition can boycott LokSabha</comment>

<comment>Hhahaha too lame!!!! Buddy get ur facts Right..Check stats..80% of BOYCOTT was done by Congress Alliances...SP, BSP ETC ETC</comment>

<comment>Where did u get that 80% figure sir???</comment>

<comment>go watch Videos of Lok Sabha...u cna watch them in website of Loksabha</comment>

<comment>I am asking about that 80% number? Could u pls quote or paste the source?</comment>

<comment>yeah sure but only after u tell me the number of Boycotts in 15th Lok Sabha... :)</comment>

<comment>I am not the one who gave a figure..</comment>

<comment>yeah dun worry m still sticking to my words...Coz I have watched each and every drama of congress and it's allies in 15th loksabha...</comment>

<comment>Why? You want one to be given to congress?</comment>

<comment>All bluffs. We had a better cabinet before.</comment>

<comment>to aao mera choos lo aa ke</comment>

<comment>Where are the Achche Din???</comment>

<comment>People not giving enough seats to Congress to become leader of opposition - this is the very beginning of Acche Din!</comment>

<comment>chootiye 1 mahina bita nahi aur jalne lagi teri abhi se .. thoda time to de chootiye</comment>

<comment>Gas Prices will remain same that's called acche din</comment>

<comment>Congress Packed for 44 that's called acche Din!!!</comment>

<comment>we want congress mukth bharat thats what people of India voted for, they should not be given any title let it wane away into obscurity</comment>

<comment>Is the BJP looking to deny Congress Leader of Opposition role?no, the electorate has.</comment>

<comment>Congress is "THE" single biggest culprit in weakening the constitutional institutions/positions. It has almost always tried to circumvent every possible rule/tradition to their advantage. Such a party shall "NEVER" receive anything which they don't rightfully deserve as per the rules.</comment>

<comment>Definitely we'll have Rahulji's Government in 2019</comment>

<comment>the year India wins FIFA world cup, then in the next election Rahul will become PM of India,</comment>

<comment>I think you mean 2119?</comment>

<comment>Bilkul bhai No doubt!!! N Rahul Gandhi 2019 me fifa World Cup bhi jeetwaega India Ko ...lol :p</comment>

<comment>***BCB*** with a stronger number.. 350 Seats for Congress alone in 2019</comment>

<comment>3+5+0 = 8 seats. Nothing more than that!</comment>

<comment>hahaha aur sunao!!!!</comment>

<comment>Bring Congress Back (BCB) should be the mission of Indians.</comment>

<comment>Congress Congress Congress Congress</comment>

<comment>Congress was good for the country. Feel bad seeing them now. I hope they strike back</comment>

<comment>in what way was it 'good' for the 'country'?</comment>

<comment>Who gave Food Security Bill? Who gave Lokpal? Who gave NREGA? Who gave RTI? Pls see..</comment>

<comment>What way are these good? They demonstrate a cheap coverup for the amount of destruction the same cong did. There is no need for FSB if PDS is implemented properly. There is no need for RTI if govt had any transparency. There is no need for RTE if govt schools are run well. Similarly all others. They are all needed in the first place because of what cong did to govt.Next?</comment>

<comment>hahaha aur suna bhai!!!</comment>

<comment>it's not the BJP it is PEOPLE of India who has rejected Congress Even for A strong Opposition</comment>

<comment>I think for people to stay alert, Cong deserves the LOP status. To keep a check on Modi Sarkar. Why not give it to them? Mr.Kharge's speech was excellent in the Loksabha.</comment>

<comment>When you beg for something be humble and don't demand it.</comment>

<comment>The Congress never accepted the LoP in the past when the main opposition party did not meet the 10% criterion.  Today they are crying foul. On no account should the arrogant bunch be given the LoP status; let it and its crony media raise a ruckus.</comment>

<comment>From 44 Cong will go do down to 24 in a few months. Why fight for LOP now???!!!=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Congress was literally thrown out by the people in the most ignominious manner. ---Cong is totally shameless to expect LOP even after they were kicked out ---With just 44 members, to expect LOP is infelicitous, improper and unjustified---In any case, in a few months from now, Congress will find its strength reduced from 44 to 24 or even less - because the series of MEGA SCAMS and BLACKMONEY OWNENERSHIPS may disqualify many of the MPs and they will be in Tihar instead of LS.</comment>

<comment>I remember there was a picture (Hindi Movie) in my younger days.  It was named HOUSE NO.44. Old timers will recollect the same.  Now Congress is in the HOUSE with 44 members!</comment>

<comment>Does the INC even qualify for the LOP status.  Please tell</comment>

<comment>Tell me my dear friend, when did Kangress really recognize the rule book ? Have they taken any such note during their rule of ten long years.  Even when there was a strong opposition and an LOP in Sushma Swaraj whether they recognised her opposition in appointing CVC, CBI director and other constitutional posts ? What happend to JPC report on 2G and whether they ever consulted opposition parties before tabling important bills.  Modi was right when he campaigned on rooting out Kangress from India.  Most of the ills of we Indians had is due to Kangress's wrong policy and mal-governance.  It is high time we get India completely Kangress free. Before election results  they conspired with third front to come to power by hook or crook and now alas!! they are now planning to forge an opposition !!!!</comment>

<comment>Very interesting situation altogether, my views are 1. There needs to be some threshold for becoming LOP. What is point in having 'highest number' as criteria when we have so many parties. I think threshold can be reduced but in no way it should be kept as highest number because then this position more by way "chance" and not merit.2. LOP is desirable to have to ensure realtime check on govt. At least dissent vote is important.2. I would suggest only a national party should be able to nominate LOP .... at least MPs from 4 states. To reduce AIDMK or BJD to their size. The criteria to ensure some pan India presence</comment>

<comment>What's to deny...the people have spoken and denied already!!</comment>

<comment>Why should BJP give ? As per our constitution Congress falls below 10% seats in House required to become a Leader of Opposition.</comment>

<comment>Why are you worried?Oh,  bootlickers worry for their madam right?I forgot!</comment>

<comment>brilliant work by BJP. High time rule books are shown to congress. Irony is the sarcastic attitude that congress has developed towards BJP and towards all those who voted for them. The tone of all the congress leaders taunting with ACHE DIN is a clear sign of sarcasm. To top it all, they still blame congress inability to communicate as the sole reason for loss. Anybody who has such a MYOPIC and short sighted view of issues, does not deserve any recognition.</comment>

<comment>It was 35 long years in parliament when congress didn't allow leader of opposition to be formed in parliament ....and enjoyed monopoly...things have changed now ..!!</comment>

<comment>Congress Who? Italian RSVP Dynasty Who? With only 44 LS seats Congress actually comes within the category of "Who?".! How can such a miniscule party be recognized as LoP? Please do not degrade Indian democratic traditions as the precedence was set by the Congress. </comment>
