<comment>JNU idiots have no problem with slogans like "Bharta Ki Barbadi Tak Jang Rahegi", they will not protest against it openly. But when other demand #ShutDownJNU, they oppose it.Clearly thye are parasites.</comment>

<comment>This is the profile of Sandipan Sharma author of this article, who is mentally challenged and spreading rubbish on media, he should be penalized for this, guys here facebookdotcom/sandipan.sharma.16/</comment>

<comment>This is nothing but the demonstration of how art/social section of JNU has remains a rabid Maoist den, in absence of little measurable in evaluation process in art subject you R completely at the mercy of the professors/teacher unlike science, therefore the decision of these student to save their careers can't be criticized given that left don't just punish dissent but kills it.</comment>

<comment>Those JNU students who feels this Govt. is politicizing your university.. then please first of all stop this march and also stop supporting few anti-nationals including your Hero so called Umar Khalid directly / indirectly... Because Camera never lie.If you really want to improve the standard and image of your university on a global map then be humble and start improving the standard of your research, human resource, social inclusion, integration and most important a message to the world that further we never allow these Anti- Nationals elements to enter, germinate and spread in our holy campus...We Indians are 1 and our unity is in diversity.. Our strength is our universities and institutions who teach.. the lessons of Humanity, Science and Integrity .. No one can influence our intention towards our Nation and please never misunderstand our "Tolerance"</comment>

<comment>O God... U people just use your sense...If some 1 scold your mother before your eyes and threat her to kill and cut her into pieces  ... than u react it just by arguing ... "Tere ko jo karna hai kar.. par mere ko disturb mat kar"Just think .. When these few Anti Nationals were protesting march within campus.. and shouting slogan to destroy India, Pakistan Zindabad.. what rest who think they are nationalist in JNU were doing.. are they enjoying their slogan or Maze le rahe the aacha hai.. aaj slogan ga rahe hai.. kal desh ko pakistan or islam ke naam pe divide v denge... aur so called Hindus.. bewakufo ki tarah inki baato main aa ke aur inke philosophy ki analysis karne main hi din gawange.. fir baat main royenge hum fir gulam ho gaye...Atleast u people take lessons from other developed nation.. hum sidhe saadhe log pehle v gulami kiye the.. aur aisi soch rahi to aage v karenge... Good keep it up you fools..Kavi socho hamari in harkato se ye pakistan aur Hafiz saeed jaise terrorist kitne khush ho rahe honge... saale khud main lad marenge.. kyu ki hindu kavi v unite nahi rehte.. inko sirf apne se matlab hota hai... apne desh aur community se nahi..Atleast border pe khade apne soldier ke bare main to socho.. People who think these anti national elements in JNU were correct.. kamino apne dil se poocho.. how many of you have actually paid silence for atleast 1 min to our brave soldier Lance naik Hanumanthappa..Shame on you guys ....Who knows nothing about our nation but express like they are the true nationalist...Learn lessons from your past and neighbors before enjoying these bullshit discussions...We gain nothing but we loose every second...</comment>

<comment>Guys.. These commies and MSM are trying to confuse everyone.. Earlier they tried Hindu muslim Thatbdid not work they tried upper caste lower casteThen they tried anti bjp and anti govtThen they said one mla has beaten up their supporter completely hiding the fact that they were provoked... Just be careful of these free loaders....And don't let the original issue of raising anti India slogan be put on the back burner...Let's keep the debate alive and force them to answer some questions...Jai hind...</comment>

<comment>Seems that the media is only concerned with anti BJP rhetoric.Where was the media when Malda riots occured . Why has it not taken a strong stand on fellows openly threatening for disintegration of our motherland through orchestrated slogan shouting.Will some thing like this be tolerated in some other country. If it had happened in China or North Korea, this guy called Kanhaiyya would have been shot through the head till now. Even in US, he would have been out of bounds and incarcerated in jail for along, long period.But it is only in India where the so called intelligentsia sees everything wrong in any action taken by a right minded government. The media sees to be only concerned when it wants to deride BJP and its leaders. Why not lampoon Rahul Gandhi and all those CPM leaders who made a beeline to JNU despite seeing secessionist elements deriding India and eulogizing terrorists.Enough of this crony reportage from a highly biased media .</comment>

<comment>Almost Every single NEWS CHANNEL was silent on MALDA RIOTS. Where was ur conscience then Pre$$titutes ??Its quite evident that u guys are being paid by the leftists depending on the news u chose to cover. JNU Incident is nothing in front of MALDA RIOTS yet u SOB's chose to ignore it.</comment>

<comment>Anything happens in Delhi is easy for these guys to film and show it on TV and call themselves a great journalist. If something happens in Malda, these guys will not able to move their As# and get the report. Also, there are chances they might get attacked. Who has in Media got the guts today. They are all mere posturing as great journalist, without real steal. Most of Media persons have got sold out and they want to njoy their life. Journalism is just namesake.</comment>

<comment>Cudn't agree more with u</comment>

<comment>I don't know about the ABVP leaders..but I know for sure that the media needs a rethink about what is secularism and what isn't...the response that NDTV and CNN-IBN are getting on Twitter makes it clear that the common man is not siding with their ideology...instead Arnab's strong nationalist sentiment is getting support all over the country...</comment>

<comment>Muslim historian Firishta [full name Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah, born in 1560 and died in 1620], the author of the Tarikh-i Firishta and the Gulshan-i Ibrahim, was the first to give an idea to the medieval bloodbath that was India during Muslim rule, when he declared that over 400 million Hindus got slaughtered during Muslim invasion and occupation of India. Survivors got enslaved and castrated. India’s population is said to have been around 600 million at the time of Muslim invasion. By the mid 1500’s the Hindu population was 200 million= the great genocide of Indian hindus  by muslim rulers as said by a muslim historian ,</comment>

<comment>typical shoot and scoot policy of the opposition , be it leftists ,aapturds or congress , they are not willing to own up responsibility ,congress hung Afzal guru but now says that it is wrong ( why did they hang him in the first place ) leftists say ,w e did not authorise the event , but all the leftist union leaders were in that anti national event , and why did they not stop it if they consider it antinational (as per their word which now they say they respect constitution )aap turds - well they killed a gajendra and blamed it on the police ( saying police did  not help , but they do not answer why the aapturds prevented the police from helping him ) 'we are in a situation in India where everyone says that the current govt is responsible and have to correct it but the opposition will not allow parliament to function or discuss because the gandhi's have to be released from NH case .heard that Ra GA has gone to meet the president wonder why , he was responsible for instigating the students despite his govt hanging guru , strange politicians or should I say strange Indian sickular politicians</comment>

<comment>In the last quarter, 1 trillion Rupees worth of loans were told be waived off....Who are the main defaulters ?There's one in a large building in Mumbai who apparently owes 1,25,000 Crore INR and won't pay. Another in Gujarat.......If Banks are not to collapse, GoI needs to feed them money tho' BoB has declined help. But others need this help. Word is, GoI apparently offered, about 70,000 Crores to the Banks.Where does GoI get that kind of money from ?Income Tax by individuals. The hike in Excise Duty on petrol is ostensibly to meet the ED target set last year.OTOH, it could be to help pay the Banks. Because Banks gave money to politically connected crooks.Bottom Line : the ordinary citizens pay so that the rich can live their luxurious lives.So easy to subvert the country's economy.Now, SC has said that it's watching what's happening at Patiala court.But the black coated baboons at Patiala Court yelled at a lady journalist asking her what can SC do, this is how it is here. Go call SC if you want but we'll still format your smartPhone.IOW, these lawyers, don't give a rat's rear as far as SC is concerned.Under these circumstances, a question arises : would the very powerful people ruling this country, manage to subvert the Judiciary itself and somehow threaten the SC judges and tell them not cross the paths of nationalists or else they too would be subjected to the same treatment that the unshaven college kid was ?IOW, is it possible for such very powerful folks - with the help of violent mobs - to subvert the judiciary ?</comment>

<comment>some ABVP are leaving ,probably under duress , and threats , see the leftistsstill  rule the roost in JNU .its is not them showing the mirror but the sickular press trying to subvert the action against nationalists in the name of free speech ( my bloody left foot ) , ask those guys in private , they would be saying mom and dad told us not be involved in the dirty leftist politics of JNU</comment>

<comment>Dear All,Those who think our govt. is not doing fair with these anti-nationals.. then just think once what would happen if these anti-nationals will break our country into fragments and celebrate jihad & Islamic states..We have to join our hand to stand firmly against these Anti-Nationals.. otherwise no will will save our Morther India.  These anti-nationals just want to kill our mother .. an our politicians are doing nothing just to play the game of vote politics...No body is saying that entire JNU is Anti- national. Just don't follow what few bloody politicians of left/right are reflecting to you... Try to go in depth before writing comments.. Believe in the integrity of True Indian.. otherwise in no time this country will be divided into many fragments among which few of them will be called as Islamic states... SAVE INDIA..

<comment>All National Defense academy cadets hold JNU degree .... technically make them JNU students ...i am sure none of them is Deshdrohi . JNU hase given hundreds of bureaucrats, diplomats  .... calling entire JNU as anti national is extreme.

<comment>Defence officers getting the jnu degree is purely incidentle.. They never step in this commie free loader university. They continue with their training at NDA in Pune for three years.. Only affiliate.. Teachers are also theirs...no role of these free loading commies..</comment>

<comment>yes but when logical thinking of a university student is lost in the so called liberalism ( does liberalism mean only the leftist thought  of the unions without due respect to the nation or its constitution u could say the students did not raise anti natioanl slogans  but who allowed those antinationals into the university - the students themselves , and if they are innocent why are the 5 students who were responsible for the event absconding ) . those students have a right to vote and are considered major , they should put up the hand and say we will not allow such things in the campus</comment>

However these elements only want AAZADI in the name of JIHAAD.. and this were provoke by few politicians, terrorists and ISIHence pls don't get misguided.. lets join hand and try to stop these anti nationals from spreading..Whole world is suffering and we know why... & try to learn from those developed nations... there is ZERO tolerance..Recently France passed a bill in their assembly.. France will never negotiate and immediately terminate the citizenship of individuals found guilty in any such anti-national activity.. whether his / her involvement found directly / indirectly..We Indians are very tolerant ,... an please understand behaving mute / tolerant in such activity shows cowardliness.. which this anti nations knows it very well about India..Sharhad pe Jawano ka Seer Kalam Kiya... Chahe Malda me violence kiya..

<comment>These is exactly what you people are not trying to understand ... no body is supporting anti national slogans, every damn leader has condemned it even Kanhaiya Kumar. What people are expecting is rational action against those and not on entire university.</comment>

<comment>Then why is the entire university supporting these traitors...</comment>

<comment>I don't have a retort to this. You want to remain brainless</comment>

<comment>BJP has not touched a leftist of a jnuite or a porki but  bihari!!  Modi shah will bite dust for putting hands on a bihari . revenge will be taken. </comment>

<comment>Fake biharis and their fake mouthpieces like you do not represent the true nature of my state. We can be anything but anti national. Kanhiaye Kumar is not a bihari but a deshdrohi....period! He is as much a son of Bihar as Ishrat was a daugher!</comment>

<comment>Kanhaiya is only mistaken in the belief that he will unite all the working class . but he should know that even those people from other states deride biharis . Its about common culture . But nonetheless , he is a bihari and will be saved at any cost and befitting reply will be given to others branding him as anti national .</comment>

<comment>we are true to our soil . our own sil . Not of gujjus or punjabis who kick poor bihars labourers the same way they get kicked in saudi arabia .</comment>

<comment>That bihari was an upper caste bhumihar. Bhumihars vote overwhelmingly for the BJP.</comment>

<comment>All the biharis have seen the antibihari nature of BJP and modi shah in particular. They must be oustwd or we will capture the political power of India .</comment>

<comment>But darling, Bihar is not India. There are other parts in India.</comment>

<comment>JNU was the creation of the family when free India's only dictator was bedding the communists for perpetual political power. Mohan Kumarangalam, Indrajit Gupta, Dange...these comrades were close advisors. The arrangement was communists will have their space to indulge in their favorite pastime of intellectualising as they had no mass connect to people and culture of India except indulging in trade union thuggery. This suited the dictator and family with the air cover of socialism to indulge in large scale monopolization of all Democratic institutions. Even bureaucracy, judiciary, academic and cultural institutions were not left out. Today's intellectuals, English media, historians, social scientists...these are the products and beneficiaries of the family's Royal dispensation of favors. For the first time, even with a brief NDA power in late 90s, Indian voted BJP a right wing and more importantly non-family outfit. Now, hell has broken lose for Family, it's firm and the commies. The air cover of socialism, assumed intellectualising... are facing the heat. It is truly a turf war where immoral occupants are being challenged and with political power. It was so in intolerance debate, in Rohit's suicide, beef drama...This is just the beginning. These are ones who have tasted stolen honey and so they will fight. BJP and it's partners should stay focused on governance but ensure these ground battles are fought fully with full ammunition. No let up, no coziness or shyness. This is the third war of Indian Independence, the enemy is from within.</comment>

<comment>When you take out old rotten, good for nothing, useless, rusted, outdated goods from the loft of a house, which were ridden with lizards, cockroaches, bugs, insects and beat them in sun to dust them out, a vareity of creatures come out of them and start running helter-skelter for their life. Some will escape to other places for safety, some will be hiding inside and some come out at a fatal moment to eat a death inflicting blow. The latter ones make all sorts of noises in their defense, and these are what you are witnessing day in and out in mainstream media these days. This will temporarily dirty the place where the cleaning was undertaken. But with time, the place will be cleaned of menacing bugs, which was the intention to start dusting in the first place.By 2019, if the place is still dirty, you will anyway have your choices ready and can throw out those who dirtied the house. Meanwhile patience would be worthwhile to see the time sweep past, as it will answer all questions. Ishrat Jahan is a glaringly stark example, where time has provided some answers on who was right and who was wrong.So be patient, dear countrymen, do not jump into conclusions.</comment>

<comment>They were in the fore front when anti-national slogans were chanted and now they do not want to face the law. Moreover the teachers are asking about the scope of the investigation.... the very teachers under whose noses this event was organized making them not only stupid but worse than Eunuchs (actually this is just for the word otherwise eunuchs are much better than them... they are nationalists). Spare no one in this case as country comes above all ... matru bhoomi !!! ..... At the same time also concentrate on the "MAKE IN INDIA" initiative by the BJP government as it is a good one... this will give us jobs and not JNU or Jadavpur. Yes justice of the top order needs to be done to these traitors.</comment>

<comment>A public poll should be conducted to decide whether JNU should be closed or not.</comment>

<comment>Poll Results:Yes- 85%No- 10%Can't Say- 5%</comment>

<comment>The ten percent sounds suspiciously close to the percentage of a certain community.</comment>

<comment>Thank god ... your poll total is summing up to 100%, i would not been surprised if you have put Yes as more than 100% .... Bhakti needs no logic</comment>

<comment>Good riddance to bad rubbish. If those ABVP leaders are blown away by leftist ideology then they had no nationalist convictions in the first place.</comment>

<comment>Best govt of india was vajpayee lead NDA govt. I miss those days. I am fan of BJP and idolize vajpayee, yashwant, jaswant, advani, shorie, nitesh team...yeah made erchod ...modi and motu shah spoilt everything.....</comment>

<comment>Had Modi anything to do with your mother?</comment>

<comment>But the same duo was responsible for the resurgence of BJP. Otherwise an anti-Cong wave was prevalent even in 2009 especially after 26/11, but people had no choice but to vote for Cong again as there was no strong and popular BJP leader then. Modi ji and Amit Shah ji turned the tables around. As for Vajpayee ji, undoubtedly he is the most popular BJP PM till date, but even he could not generate the kind of mass hysteria that Modi ji did.</comment>

<comment>Very true. Vajpayee was just another impotent liberal in the nehruvian mould. Our nation needs a no nonsense leader who is a mix of Ronald Reagan, Thatcher and Lee Kuan Yew to lead our nation to greatness. Modi comes close to this ideal combination.</comment>

<comment>all of them will be sent to Pakistan, as they opposed Modi.</comment>

<comment>What a sorry state the country called India is !! There are traitors who are openly challenging Indian Constitution, openly raising "War cry" against elected Indian Govt. and openly glorifying terrorists who were awarded death sentence by the supreme court in India, and Indians are busy debating whether its "democratic" to nab these "intellectuals", whether they should be tried in court, whether or not their "freedom of speech" is being suppressed ?? No patriotic country on this world would have done this. This can happen only in India. Same case in China/Russia/Israel would have resulted in "culling" by death squad !!! Shame !!</comment>

<comment>We just want the students who chanted pro afzal slogans along with other anti-India slogans to be punished. Dats it ..... but the opposition along with some Pre$$titutes hv made an issue out of it for their own benefit.</comment>

<comment>naah, didn't you read comments, they want journalists killed, JNU shutdown, they were happy and celebrating Tarique Anwar got attacked. They are comparing OP Sharma to Bhagat Singh</comment>

<comment>There's not gonna be a shutdown ..... no one wud get killed .... OP Sharam  & Bhagat Singh ?? Seriously .... u an even ignore those comments. But there also comments like Kanhaiya is innocent, this is happening all becoz of BJP & RSS and other sickular comments. u 4got to mention those.Bottom-line is .... Culprits must be Punished PERIOD.</comment>

<comment>Fiest we have to decide if sedition law is against freedom of speech</comment>

<comment>They certainly have broken the law and dats why many culprits are on the run. Raids are also being conducted for the same.</comment>

<comment>there is blood lust in the air. You can keep your nose closed to it.</comment>

<comment>So was in MALDA. Nobody gave a shit. It seems your nose was closed at that time too.</comment>

<comment>yes, I can sense blood lust in both Hindu and Muslim. Let us have a civil war. Which is betterHindu vs Muslim or Left vs Right. I prefer a mix of both.</comment>

<comment>Yeah .... Me too ... but Muslims are getting benefitted in india from their inception. You can be in denial but dat's the truth. And when Hindus protests against something these guys along with adarsh liberals brigade and some sickulars call us names and whatnot. WOW!</comment>

<comment>tell me how exactly muslims are getting benefited ? haj subsidy ? now if you tell me muslim condition in India is better than Hindu condition in Pakistan, I will agree. but what do you mean by muslim community getting benefited ? why should they not get benefited.Have you read Sachar committee report ? the conditions of muslims is probably closest to Dalits in India. if you read any socio economic report, any valid one, you  will find Hindus dominate everything in India, jobs, business, wealth etc. Hindus are already dominating everything in India. Yet you feel only muslims are getting benefited.</comment>

<comment>As i already said .... U can be in denial. dats your choice. But Indian Muslims are amongst the happiest in the world if u compare them with those living in other countries. They are fighting everywhere except here.</comment>

<comment>Anti National Slogans is close to Treason, better stern actions are initiated for setting an example. Freedom of speech grants right to raise anti national slogans only in rahul Gandhi's definition as long he is in an irresponsible profession.</comment>

<comment>How come students are assuming that anti-national slogans were just? ALL JNU students who are supporting anti-national elements must be made to stand at the J & K border and defend 125 Cr Indians from Muslim terrorism, they are insulting the Armymens' courage and lives.Make them realise it's easy to talk and demonstrate on streets for freedom but what it takes to protect democracy!!Why cannot JNU be closed forever.</comment>

<comment>students are not law into themselves. Irrespective of Political colours , those person who has raised these slogans should be Restricated for 3 years from JNU.</comment>

<comment>it is time for the coterie of leftist activists masquerading as journos in FP  to reflect on the kind of damage they are causing in the society at large due to their adulation of terrorist sympathizers and the excessive coverage that they are indulging in which will and has divided the nation, have the guts to be objective, which isn't easy for your kind, about the burning issues that afflict our country instead of acting like sycophants of your political masters...</comment>

<comment>IF the tax paying citizen has a say on how his taxes to be spent, surely he will not like to spend a paisa for institutes like this with radical anti national students..students are sent to Universities by their parents for studying and that is what they should do as their first and only priority.</comment>

<comment>Neither will the tax paying citizen want to bail out bad loans of PSUs. (Like 10 lakh crores at present). Talk of what is pertinent. Stop being misled.</comment>

<comment>The communism that you hail is the same ideological mentality used by the Red Army in 1945, post the fall of Hitler, to rape and mutilate innocent German women of all ages, classes and masses, including Holocaust survivors.

<comment>But the same duo was responsible for the resurgence of BJP. Otherwise an anti-Cong wave was prevalent even in 2009 especially after 26/11, but people had no choice but to vote for Cong again as there was no strong and popular BJP leader then. Modi ji and Amit Shah ji turned the tables around. As for Vajpayee ji, undoubtedly he is the most popular BJP PM till date, but even he could not generate the kind of mass hysteria that Modi ji did.</comment>

<comment>These idiots first need to understand left ideology.These anti Indians should be charge with sedition. Enough is enough now. These all political parties and media are only making money out of these idiots. As a common man of this country I expect inquiry on this matter. And humble request to all anti Indians to leave this country if you dont like its constitution, judiciary and people.</comment>

<comment>Kind of agree.  Voted for vajpayee (indirectly of course).  No fan of modi </comment>

<comment>The fact that the younger generation, the college students consider Afzal Guru, Memon, Ishrat Jahan as their heroes. This fact is way more bothersome than any right-wing ideology.</comment>

<comment>Only the communist.  They supported China in 1962 </comment>

<comment>India occupied chinas land so communists supported china.</comment>

<comment>yes, yes. keep telling tht to yourself and someday you will not feel guilty about being anti national.</comment>

<comment>JNU ke budget mein they can make many schools....</comment>

<comment>that must have been the plan all along.</comment>

<comment>Hope it works.  Will save a lot of taxpayers money </comment>

<comment>I feel JNU is a small fry, it was probably more ideology driven, why should a right-wing govt fund left wing JNU. If you want to save real money, much bigger things are around, BSNL, Air India, Railways etc. </comment>

<comment>ya sab kuch bandh karwaa do!! nice solution</comment>

<comment>central govt structure itself is the problem. I meant privatize,not shutdown,</comment>

<comment>this is going away from the topic of discussion in this post!! :)but any way is privatization a solution??? We have not yet felt the impact of full privatization. that is why we dont know,,, but the trailer is being shown by the ambanis and mittals who have entered . giving you an eg: the mumbaione metro of the anil ambanis estimated in 2007, was Rs 2,356 crore now reliance claims it to be 4000 Cr and wants to increase the ticket price from Rs 40 max to 110 max.. and that is not the end of it.. either they cheated the govt on bidding or they have made no of deals of kick backs . either way the sufferer is the common man...this is one eg of pvtTake the case of mobile companies, it is pure loot. or the pvt airlines.. you can see only the smiling faces and think  first class service is being provided. you only hear complains about Air india in the media.. are other airlines absolutely fool proof in their services??? NO they manage media and I know for a fact how they do :)So PVT LTD is not a solution</comment>

<comment>this actually pretty much marks you out as a left-winger and a hard one at that. Sure private companies have looted the country. What about public companies ? what about banks ? have they not looted the taxpayers, their NPAs are now about to crush the economy. All the discoms are bleeding red and their bad loans can actually cripple the banking sector.Which PSU actually has done well ? if there was open competition between govt owned and private companies with level playing field, you will find that private companies do things a lot better. They manage costs a lot better. They manage operational cash flows a lot better.In my personal opinion, where govt has failed is in regulation of private companies, either due to vested interest/corruption or due to lack of awareness of citizens. But regulations and giving more freedom to private companies to operate as they wish has a thin line and it is a balancing act. If there is too much regulation, it will actually curb the productivity, if there is too little regulation, nation's interests won't get served.  Private companie are not there to serve nation's interests, they are there to maximize shareholder wealth.Take a look at net-neutrality policy decision. This was the perfect decision by govt. They are not getting into business, but they have created conditions for citizens to benefit and for real capitalism to thrive, not crony capitalism.</comment>

<comment>:) this is the problem! brading as left right centre half chaddi bakths congiwhat i said was privatisation is not the soln!! socialism is not the soln and definitely communism is notBTW i would like you to remind about Global trust bank that was merged to a PSU bankNot all pvt banks are HDFC or icici.... the NPA problem was not built in 3 months it is the result of political interference of the past decades that is coming up now in the open. That is what i feelAny way I end my post here , I have a opinion that Privatization is not the answer...BTW gr8 PSU like Engineers india Power grid also exist in india .. please dont label me as a socialist now :)</comment>

<comment>wasn't branding you left or right. Left or right are just monikers. but if one dislikes privatization and want govt-run companies and has a general mistrust of private companies, that pretty much makes you a left winger in general.</comment>

<comment>The next government may not be right wing.  But jnu will keep talking our money and then calling for Bharat ki barbadi </comment>

<comment>and the problem of taxpayer money would remain. Man railways is overstaffed like anything, need to prune that by 50 percent at least. Massive savings.  Prune central bureaucracy.As for bharat ki barbadi, let court decide and decide on the quantum of punishment. but from what limited knowledge I have, even if the students did call for bharat ki barbadi, it won't stick, because they did not call for actual violencce.</comment>

<comment>So they may not go to jail but at least stop my tax money going to them. </comment>

<comment>see if your intention is to save taxpayer money, JNU is the wrong target.</comment>

<comment>My thoughts are quite clear : if you take tax money,  be loyal and grateful to the country. </comment>

<comment>ok, agreed on that. but people being loyal and grateful to the country for central govt funding won't solve the misuse of taxpayer money issue.</comment>

<comment>DENGUEWAL has created record of HIGHEST DENGE RELATED DEATHNOW HE IS SPENDING HIS MONEY AGAIN ON ADVERTISINGAFTER 3 MONTHS AGAIN DENGUE WILL HIT BACK.#DICTATOR</comment>

<comment>A JNU student on quora justifies the term barbadi by saying it means end of military oppression in Kashmir.....Really wonder this is what they teach at JNU</comment>

<comment>calling for end of military oppression in Kashmir is neither anti-national or secessionist.</comment>

<comment>Haha...first call bharat ki barbadi and then come with a flimsy justification</comment>

<comment>let the court decide what they meant, but if they really meant end of military oppression in Kashmir, it is not anti-national or even sedition.</comment>

<comment>So give court a chance.  Why oppose action against him in court? </comment>

<comment>freedom of speech, come on man.</comment>

<comment>Court will judge,  not you </comment>

<comment>don't go mad like these chaddies, even Irom Shormila is on  fast calling for end of AFSPA.</comment>

<comment>JNU students are being brainwashed by the extremist left-wing and maoist parties as well as commies. And of course, the media. Barkha and Rajdeep as usual show their true colours in such circumstances. Arnab is the real man. He'll attack fire with fire. No compromises.</comment>

<comment>Same can be said about RSS.</comment>

<comment>Then how come 95% of the media is espouses leftist ideology and not that of the RSS?</comment>

<comment>are you sure it's not 89.3 %   or 76.1 %  ..if you find that troubling ... then may be you should stick social media misinformation campaign and party mouthpieces ...</comment>

<comment>I agree! Aurnab is really doing great patriotic job...unbiased....hitting out both sides equally.... Though he creates nuisance many times...but he is doing great job.....add more name...Deepak Chaurasia...</comment>

<comment>Arnab is an opportunist</comment>

<comment>ABVP?</comment>

<comment>Oh so you're gonna accuse Arnab of being an ABVP activist now? Great! Typical sickular mentality. When you run out of logical arguments, make false insinuations.</comment>

<comment>You are a bit slow on the uptake.</comment>

<comment>And you are way too hasty, often to the point of not making sense.</comment>

<comment>It was all going perfectly well for BJP when the JNU students were caught on camera shouting ant-India slogans.

And their Police had to act like bunch of HIJRAS. Once again it is proven that BJP/RSS are a bunch of dud brain Safron Maniacs...unfit to rule the country.

<comment>Typical all emotions and no logic Bhakt dud head reply</comment>

<comment>"The incident of 9th Feb. 2016 in JNU, for all those whohave been in the campus or know about the varsity was nothing new as suchincidences have taken place with impunity in the past. Just to recount theHawala episode came to limelight after a terrorist Sahabuddhin Ghori wasarrested from the campus in the mid nineties. In 1996, the then AISA (studentwing of CPI (ML) invited terrorists from the valley to address students in JNUonly to be thwarted by nationalist in the campus. In the year 2000, two armymen were brutally beaten up during a friendship Mushaira organised by one ofthe left student organisation cause they protested anti-Indian mushaira beingrendered by the participants. In 2009, when more than 70 paramilitary forceswere killed in Dantewada, Chhattisgarh, there was celebration in the campus andthe Indian flag was burnt by the activist of AISA and other naxal group. Fewyears back a student of JNU was arrested for having links with Naxals, who heldmany parts of the country to hostage. These are just a handful of many suchinstances which have never got the limelight that it deserved. The readerswould be surprised to know that no action whatsoever was initiated against allthose involved in the incidences mentioned above mostly because they were patronizedby vested interest in the campus and also because the media never took theseincidences seriously."by Mr Prakash Nanda, Editor of Geopolitics.</comment>

<comment>Yeah right. The whole world knows, except for you, it seems, how Congress goons in 1984 massacred 4,000 innocent Sikhs in Delhi alone and 12,000 all over India. I am not trivializing anybody's death, but that's triple the number of the combined death toll of 1992 and 2002. So according to you all Congress grassroot workers are Harvard pass outs.

<comment>Innocent blood shed anywhere is abominable, whether in Godhra, Gujarat or Delhi, or Mumbai or Kolkatta. But you can't speak of one without speaking of the other. Ask the most educated person in Gujarat about the riots and he'll tell you that both Hindus and Muslims were responsible for the riots. The blame cannot be placed on a single community.</comment>

<comment>The most educated person in Gujarat still has a long way to go to see the reality. Train burning was a BJP/RSS plan just like throwing beef in temples or sending veiled ABVP goons to raise slogans ...we all know rss gameplan by now </comment>

<comment>Seriously! You can see how balanced my argument was and how I blamed both sides for violence. But you can see how he again provoked me by making horrendous insinuations against BJP/RSS and abusing them. He nurtures the same mentality as that of Azam Khan and other sickularists. Perpetrate the crime, then play the victim.</comment>

<comment>Yes i agree your argument was as balanced as it could be. It may not have been the truth but it was balanced to equally blame both sides.</comment>

<comment>Don't bring in past. Sikhs are nationalists now as they accept supremacy of hindustan over khalsa.. they are great people, a very brave community.</comment>

<comment>yes we hindus are always apologetic to sikhs for that incident. No words can express our remorse and regret.</comment>

<comment>Yes "we" Hindus" have. But have "they" (the Muslims) apologized for Mopla, Direct Action day, Noakhali, Partition, 1971 Bangladesh, Godhra and the centuries of Muslim and Mughal rule? So who's intolerant?</comment>

<comment>What if some Indians want to screww mother and Indians want to screww motherland?? Is this the reason why Indian men have difficulty in have girl friends and India does not want to get involved in wars outside India, and is deeply INWARD looking?Sigmund Freud father of psychoanalysis said "mother worship" when asked to define India. Continuing this analysis::Arnab Goswami goes slightly wrong when he says even left loves India. Love non-mediated by religion turns motherly love to love for female. That is why Left is intent of screwwing India. That love is sexual love for mother, motherland. Jats and Kapus in Andhra Pradesh[who have burnt a train] are demanding reservation. That is again immoral sexual love for motherland.Such effect of predatory sexual love for motherland [nothing wrong with motherly love]has even led to murder of motherland in history as following shows..Dahir was BRAHMIN King in Sindh. By enlisting the support of local tribes (such as the Jats, Meds and Bhuttos) and Buddhist rulers of Nerun, Bajhra, Kaka Kolak and Siwistan as infantry to his predominantly-mounted army, Muhammad bin Qasim defeated Dahir and captured his eastern territories for the Umayyad Caliphate.Dahir then tried to prevent Qasim from crossing the Indus River, moving his forces to its eastern banks. Eventually, however, Qasim crossed and defeated forces at Jitor led by Jaisiah (Dahir's son). Qasim fought Dahir at Raor (near modern Nawabshah) in 712, killing him; Dahir's wife immolated herself (with other women in her household) in accordance with the Hindu tradition of Jauhar.=========================================================Academicians have swallowed a fascist lie spread by media that India is a democracy.What a Joke! What about the assault on Individual right of merit by reservation policy? In which country are cities brought to a halt by bandhs? Media should first say India was a Ocholocracy[mob rule].India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] not a democracy. Free speech can be explosive unless it is a part of movement to uproot the Ocholocracy. In a Ocholocracy INDIVIDUAL rights are murdered by definition with help of state. Examples of murder of INDIVIDUAL right are reservation policy which is murder of merit, an INDIVIDUAL right and socialism(by definition legal robbery) which is murder property right, another INDIVIDUAL right.Why are Indians not trusted with free gun laws as in USA? Answer to this simple question demolishes free speech argument.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why were leftists associated with secessionists? The culture of socialist legal robbery is manifesting itself as secessionism - because the socialists may have realized it is impossible to come to an understanding on who the supreme dictator should be and they want to establish numerous single part dictatorships over fragments of country. Socialism has to lead to single party dictatorships over fragments of country.Adam Smith, the father of economics, says in economics Man Proposes and God Disposes. If every body in a nation become do-gooders -- God disposes -- and we will have hell on earth. if man proposes to be selfish -- God again disposes -- and we will have prosperity and peace.Giving rational explanation of God, the elder do-gooders , MK Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Ambedkar etc forgot that a strong socialist state is required to do good. And it will demand its pound of flesh closest to the heart – rampant corruption. A strong state emerges in an environment of shortages – to distribute scant resources. Any socialist state will NOT destroy the reason for its existence. 24 hour water supply will reduce water required to be released by 30%. No Government Engineer in India will accept this. Scarcity, distress is required for the reason for its existence. If no scarcity exists it will manufacture it. Mysore had water scarcity even though it had KRS dam beside it. It is a question of power. A society can either have equality or freedom but never both. Why? To enforce equality a strong and intrusive state is required. Stateism is against Individualism and kills freedom.Since 1947, the political parties, government need not care as they have attained emancipation from democracy -- principally by the tool of reservation policy, where vote banks are formed. And they will vote according to predictable patterns whatever the rulers do or don't do. In other words India has become a Fascist state[socialism is a necessary component of it --Nazi means National Socialist]by the vehicle of reservation policy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just voting does not make India democracy. Protection of rights of the smallest minority the INDIVIDUAL MAKES A SYSTEM DEMOCRATIC. The problem is, India is an Ocholocracy[mob rule] where Individual rights are murdered[example is murder of merit an Individual right by reservation policy and property rights by socialism. Socialism is legal robbery.A period of good dictatorship may be required to cure Indians of disease of bad democracy, due to the infection of socialism or legal robbery. Otherwise bad democracy can kill in millions like in Cambodia under Pol Pot. Ocholocracy looks like democracy but it is not. Just look at immorality of Indians- Laloo the reason for largest migration of Biharis from Bihar was reelected.-----------------------------------------------------------It is logically wrong to allow communist parties to function in a multi party democracy as they are for single party dictatorship - they openly state it! Ban communist parties===================================================Now BJP/RSS should bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics2)capitalism to increase size of cake. Privatize - Remove socialism from constitution which was introduced into it under orders of KGB during emergency3)Making buying and selling of votes legal to shatter reservation vote banks and votes of tramps are bought over.4)Removing reservation policy and go for privatization so that size of cake increases by Individual effort and merit=============================================</comment>

<comment>Have they been bought by leftist forces? Mr. Students there will not be any compromise on national integrity and pride. You go to hell. We all patriotic citizens of Bharat do not bother about ur action. No anti national will be spared. Ur parents have sent u for study they might have not taught u to be anti national. So u also enjoy with these anti nationals and go to hell.</comment>

<comment>No threatened with zero marks in Viva. The leftists professors are threatening them openly as per media reports. Right from crushing their careers to even death threats, I read it</comment>

<comment>Pakistan is to our left. Then understand what is meant by Left-Leaning. All the anti-Indian forces are afraid of Modi's success and popularity. They don't want India become strong. All these foreign agents have closed their ranks and come together to remove Modi at any cost. Creating student unrest is one of their strategy. This can be spread throughout the country making way for various kinds of agitations. They may be behind the suicide of Rohit Vemula. Though he was not a Dalit he was projected as a Dalit. This was to create chasm between Dalits and other Hindu communities. All true Indians must be beware of these sophisticated scoundrels and traitors in the garb of students, professors, social activists, human rights activists etc..</comment>

<comment>Mr,.Moronic Sandeepan, save your breath ! Neither those 3 ABVP students nor BJP is the voice of India and majority of us are still upset at JNU anti national activities.</comment>
