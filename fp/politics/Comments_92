<comment>Also respect the sentiments of the people of jammu and Ladakh, considered as colonies of Kashmir due to  the stupid Article 370. The Union Territory status for Ladakh was a long-standing demand. The best solution is to make Kashmir a buffer state like Bhutan or a guarded neutrality similar to Switzerland. Scrap Article 370 and grant statehood or UT status for jammu and Ladakh. The status of Hindus in Pakistan is infinitely worse than that of the Muslims in India. So any solution that involves Hindus ending up in Pakistan is far worse than a solution involving Muslims ending up in India.</comment>
