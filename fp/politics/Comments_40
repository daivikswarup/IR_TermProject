<comment>It is simply the abominable "operation Lotus" stage managed and flourished  in Karnataka which is being reenacted yet again in Madhya Pradesh without bothering even the cost to the exchequer and despite the fact that the Party has a 2/3rd  majority in the Assembly !!And there are mental midgets here praising this victory !!This just goes to show the kind of power mongers the BJPee wallahs  really are !?Worthless party which is fit to be consigned to the dustbin !! Unfortunate, that  this Ghost  has grown to become a mainstream party like a malignant disease  !!</comment>

<comment>You have absolutely NO idea about MP politics!Even though Vajpayee has been always a much respected figure,he has never been a relevant figure in MP politics.He himself lost the election from his home city and shifted to UP's Lucknow for rest of his parliamentary career.Even at peak of his popularity,he was unable to uproot Digvijay Singh and Congress from power.</comment>

<comment>Wow. BJP should have lost in Maihar, if for nothing else, but to teach the turncoat a lesson and the BJP a lesson for Muslim appeasement at Dhar Bhojshala.But what a spin! Posters of history made BJP win by 22000 votes! Wow!</comment>

<comment>Media as usual comes up anti Modi  Article , if NDA loses by elections Modi Wave is gone , When By elections are won , due credit is not given to Modi</comment>

<comment>Huh...Advani is part of BJP.Did the author forget this fact?</comment>

<comment>moral of author's message : sonia and raul posters make congressis lose.</comment>

<comment>glorious gifts of ur kind to makindTerrorrIzm...</comment>

<comment>ATTENTION…. NEW FURMAAN……  I will put a stop to this darpok Hindu habit of continuous bickering and infighting among own people. That is why so many invaders conquered your land. Naruddin Muddi will shake hands with Oiwaisi and Azam Khan and celebrate their friendship with a beef party in Mulayam’s house.  There will be a big gazal party at night and the uneducated F A T S O Smriti Irani will do a belly dance and will serve as a “saki”. She will wear a Burkha during the day <></comment>

<comment>The article talks about large cabinets as "power sharing". Nice theory, but in reality it means more corruption as more leaders share the loot. All leaders who want to change a corrupt system have to play it tight for some time at the risk of being labelled autocratic. Dissidents are not always innocent , sometimes just sulking denial-to-loot. Modi has left Gujarat far less corrupt and far more prosperous , Chouhan has done the same in Madhya Pradesh.</comment>

<comment>Presst.....s will keep dreaming and scheming against Modi. They are completely Intolerant ti rise of Modi.</comment>

<comment>I disagree with this. Quite on the contrary half his success is the fact that unlike Modi, Raje, Raman Singh he is regarded as a very "share the power" RSS type vs. being autocrat. I think that has also been the reason that while he has had successes, he also hasn't been able to make transformations as fast as the others. On the other hand, there is a real 2nd rung leadership in MP, unlike Rajasthan and Chhatisgarh where everything is heavily dependent on Raje And Singh's image. There are pro's and con's to each approach. The biggest risk is that in the next couple of years, Congress will find a leader who can Wake it from its deep slumber in MP. But who? </comment>

<comment>as far as MP goes, I believe there is 2nd rung leadership for congress. even Modi rose through cult culture. BJP should change this and build organization. But it is not easy to win elections without a 'face'</comment>

<comment>that is a real danger which the bjp top brass should be looking into.</comment>

<comment>There should be maximum 2 continuous terms and total 3 terms for CMs and PMs. Otherwise it leads to coteries, patronage and a softer form of dictatorship.</comment>

<comment>yes! there should not be more than 15 years of any kind of office. After that they can become advisers, if they want.</comment>

<comment>You are probably correct. Another suggestion is to limit max number of terms for MPs and MLAs. </comment>

<comment>Hello everybody….. Emperor Babur here….. I am disappointed by you contiuous infighting, attacking and killing your own men and women. That is exactly how I came from a worse country as a failed knight and conquered your large land. There was nobody at the border to fight. This is called Gujarati syndrome. You and your lazy and darpk kings were busy killing and looting each other. Now I have decided to bring peace by splitting the kingdom into 5 parts. Tamil Nadu will be a separate country united with Sri Lanka. Arunachal Pradesh will be my gift to China for a beautiful Chinese princess in my Janan Khana. Gujarat will be a separate country with no army. Asaram Bapu will be president. Telangana ad Andhra Pradesh will be under Nizam’s rule again. I have brought effective Afghan cream for Telangana CM KC Rao’s burnt nose. My SECOND COMING is imminent. Insha Allah .. .</comment>

<comment>Hello Babur welcome to first known gay king of the world.Your ancestors have many more credits like your allla dalla paigu was the first person on earth to marry a 6 yr old kid.Your progeny too have been credited with some firsts in the world like------killing of your brother (dara shikoh), imprisoning ones father having sex with sister..........come on continue  with your first isis will be helping you in your exploits...............</comment>
