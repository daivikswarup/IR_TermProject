<comment>Torch bearers of Innocence and liberalism are using a university premises to hide and students as their shields to hide like cowards. They want Police to go inside so more fodder for MEDIA and Vulture political parties. In Subko Danda mar mar kar azadi sikhao jail mein. Aise ki agle 10 saal tak no one will dare do such act in JNU. bhe-n-ch-odo ka subsidy bhi band kar do....let them run by paying their own fees....10 yrs and still doing their studies, shows they are there for political survivals and life not for study. Study to sirf bahana hain ji.</comment>

<comment>I stand by JNU....</comment>

<comment>All right thinking persons must stand by JNU. Without this, our capacity to think will be severely restricted.</comment>

<comment>I do too..Has Bassi arrested lawyers and dismissed police that broke the law.</comment>

<comment>Bassi the Jat didn't arrest lawyers for breaking the law, he didn't pull up the police for not doing their job. Bassi thinks by being BJP stooge he will get some high position and he is using his power to let BJP goons beat students, so that nobody questions BJP.</comment>

<comment>YO HINDU SLAVES….. I am Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur, I am the eldest son of Umar Sheikh Mirza, a direct descendant of Turk-Mongol conqueror Timur, also known as Tamurlane, a military adventurer, a soldier of distinction, and a poet and diarist of genius, as well as a statesman. I am a direct descendant of the Mongol conqueror Chengez Khan from maternal side. The name Babur means lion in Persian. I ascended to the throne of Farhgana at the age of 14 in 1495 and came to India to defeat Ibrahim Lodi in Panipat in 1526. I also defeated the darpok Mewar's Rajput king Rana Sanga in the battle of Khanwa. So easy to win so I decided to stay. I have never seen more darpok fighters than Hindu soldiers and never seen more darpok state than Gujarat.... I am a national hero in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. I wrote his autobiography, Baburnama, in Chaghatai Turkic..... Remember it slave…. I am Babur the great who is the master of short and dark Hindu slaves including the ugly Dravidian women and neutered Hindu boys...</comment>

<comment>I am not understanding what kind of game is going on here, why is Delhi police not arresting these so called students who insulted our motherland. It is such a shame. I am sure some caveat is there in these students suddenly appearing in campus. They want to play the victim card and the Congress and Left are trying to washout the Budget session by raising these issues in parliament. Opposition parties are not finding relevant issues and are now busy manufacturing new issues each day and disrupt the peace atmosphere. My sincere appeal to all political parties, please direct ur focus/action towards the development and well-being of the nation and its people.</comment>

<comment>Why did Sushma and Vasundra let Lalit Modi escape, all the scams and corruption we hear is not insult of our motherland, when contractors give bribe and build substandard roads and pocket the money,  are they showing love for motherland.When people throw garbage from their homes on the streets, are they showing love for motherland. Filthy polluted cities, show love for the motherland.When Sikhs were butchered by hindus in 1984, Sikhs are children of India,  where was this love for motherland.Don't use this love for motherland to hood wink Indians.  No Indian shows love for freedom, they only show love for themselves, they are cheats, polluters and make their surroundings filthy, their is no love.</comment>

<comment>All these drama queens appear only before social media to beat their chest like a mad gorilla.</comment>

<comment>U r trying to mix up issues here. We are talking about JNU issue here, the inaction of police and what game the political parties are playing here, and the possible washout of budget session because of these issues. Well we can talk of many other issues like women safety, education, healthcare facilities, poor infrastructure, de-forestation, terrorism, etc. But that is a different topic of discussion and lets not mix up issues here.</comment>

<comment>We are talking about love for motherland which is absent all the times, but only comes up if somehow Indians don't like lower castes raising their voices.Most Indians are driven by selfishness.</comment>

<comment>DESCRIPTION OF GUJARAT IN “BABURNAMA”-------------------“When I invaded Gujarat, I saw very strange scenes…. I saw fat and darpok people who did not resist at all. They started crying, rolled over begging for mercy and offered money. Gujarati slaves eat a strange yellow cake called Dhokla that made stinking gas all over. I also saw a strange dance where men danced like girls with 2 sticks in their hands. There were people walking N A K E D in streets but strangely people touched their package and worshiped them….. Very strange…. They called them Digamber Swami…. In Gujarat, I also saw widows living in widow ashrams in white dress with their heads shaved. I began to realize why I never saw a single Gujarati fighter in any of the darpok Hindu army”</comment>

<comment>Gutless coward- why do you not come with your real name.</comment>

<comment>I am going to sell you to another slave owner for lousy 2 Dinars. He will come tomorrow. Be ready for a thorough cavity and teeth check. He will not pay if either is F U K K E D up.</comment>

<comment>My dear brave man ,ask Gen Niyazi .</comment>

<comment>DO NOT MISS....... There will be a grand beef and gazal party in Mulayam’s house. Naruddin Muddi will shake hands with Oiwaisi and Azam Khan and celebrate their friendship. The uneducated F A T slave Smriti Irani will come from the back door in a burkha and will do a belly and BO O T Y  dance all night. We also have a great menu.... Short and Dark Hindu slave Sadhvi Prachi will serve hot and fresh stinking Gomutra from Gujarat. The famous Hindu queer Baba Ramdev will bring and serve stinking homemade Gobur rotis. Main course is the delicious beef kheema - a courtesy from Azam Khan.</comment>

<comment>JNU is inside india.It is not .in pakistan.Anti national eliments and terrorists are hiding inside university.When army entered in to Golden Temple why not JNU.You are living on the Indian govt money.Indian Govt has all rights to enter in to JNU</comment>

<comment>Government has duty to protect the citizens and  they failed,  when they let lawyers beat a student in police custody. Also,  government has duty to insure nobody is showing doctored tapes on mass media to harm others . If they did this they should be severely punished.Police can only enter if they have warrants from court. This is India but not police raj. Police cannot enter your house without court warrant. If you allow police to do this then one of us are safe.</comment>

<comment>is hr any proof showng lawyers beating.It is a drama  created by prestitutes.If you are a white color criminal then only police cannot enter enter in to house.If a person is deadly criminal,Murderer,Traitor,Drug smugler then police can enter any where.Those who are hiding in JNU are all belong to second categary.</comment>

<comment>Bassi is doing his job and politicking is not his job. He has nothing to lose. The medicine prescribed by the communists in their heavens should be prescribed in JNU- like Tienanmen Square. And government is never helpless- it has to decide to strike. Remember railway strike of 1974- biggest trade union failure in India.</comment>

<comment>Would 'haven' fit more than 'heaven' in your analogy?</comment>

<comment>Yes. Thank you for pointing it out- I missed it.</comment>

<comment>Bassi is not doing his job, he is a stooge of BJP, he is doing their dirty work. Now he is afraid that he has been exposed. The police got students beaten by the BJP goons.</comment>

<comment>Why were the students politicking? What business do they have of talking to break India into pieces?</comment>

<comment>How media allowed inside</comment>

<comment>Today's Modi Government become helpless, not having majority in Raj Sabha and continuisous loss in Election makes anti national raised their voice.</comment>

<comment>I don't understand - You [ABVP/BJP/RSS/Police] are accusing students of something -- so the burden of proof, by all means, lies with you and not with the students [the accused]?? Who gave Bassi this position in the first place?</comment>

<comment>Henceforth, this logic should be called "Bassi's logic". </comment>

<comment>bassi kameena hai ek number ka - the india today expose is good enough to send this man to jail for extra judicial torture</comment>

<comment>I agree, Bassi is total Kameena, he should be jailed, he thinks he has won the elections and how can act like sick neta.</comment>

<comment>This please to communist terrorist is wasteless , Army should allow to Ramp inside the JNU Campus.</comment>

<comment>Bassi is still not leaving any chance to make Modi and BJP's life difficult.</comment>

<comment>I think jnu has become the safest place for thiefs, robbers, criminals and even terrorists because even the Delhi police and it's chief cannot enter the campus to arrest the seditious people without the VCs permission. What a pity!!!!!!!!</comment>

<comment>Bassi is going to retire this month , so he do not want any controversy before it.</comment>

<comment>Bassi is the one who will lose most from this fiasco.</comment>

<comment>Whatever it maybe I hope  the BJP recognizes this man's dedication and  unflinching commitment.</comment>

<comment>Yes, else I'll feel for him. </comment>
