<comment>Welcome to India where we pretend to be a democracy whereas the truth is we are a group of mini kingdoms ruled largely by stealers and looters who pass on the Crown to family members. </comment>

<comment>Islam does not permit women to rule over men and that is Sharia. Kashmiri Muslims are radiclized to the extent that they think they can give fatwa to anybody on religion in the Muslim world. She is going to cut a sorry figure as nobody in PDP will want her to be CM. </comment>

<comment>Mehbooba Mufti is a good leader and politician in the Jammu and Kashmir state.  with her cooperation, the BJP will achieve a lot.  She will be responsible in the long run for the establishment of Vishala Bharat.  Let us not quote the rules of her religion to throw her out of leadership.  Islamic countries like Bangla Desh and Indonesia have women as leaders due to the dynasty effect.</comment>

<comment>A dubious political legacy now firmly established as a dynasty.....India is family property and we are small Kingdoms despite 1947</comment>

<comment>and our mental makeup is the same  either feudal or slavish</comment>

<comment>Baap Beti party will be supported by Feku the great.</comment>

<comment>do you see any issue if our hero and your Feku  supported this party.</comment>

<comment>you bhakts have an excuse for everything.</comment>

<comment>AFTER MUFTI THE DAUTHTER WILL BE CROWNED  AKILESH HAS ALREADY TAKEN OVER FROM HIS FATHER  MULAYAM AND IN PUNJAB AFTER THE NOTORIOUSLY  CORRUPT BADAL SENIOR THE JUNIOR BADAL WILL RULE PUNJAB SO  WHY BLAME ONLY SONIA FOR PROMOTING RAHUL</comment>

<comment>Sonia is an Italian.  In Italy the people will not allow a person of Indian origin to even become a city council member, ;leave alone prime minister or president.</comment>

<comment>they know that congress under gandhis are a threat to them.</comment>

<comment>I think its good news. Not saying she will be easy to handle. but if someone can talk to the disgruntled kashmiris.its her.may be for some time ideology can be set aside and BJP/PDP work to create a ground in kashmir.BJP will consolidate Jammu/Ladakh region, and kashmir with PDP,India will eventually rule J&K in real.</comment>

<comment>BJP need to take CM post as mehbooba wont be able to handle the government!</comment>

<comment>She is a natural leader with enough grooming already and is a good thing for J&K since a strong woman leader with nationalist mindset and yet with regional sensibilities is needed there today.</comment>

<comment>I heard she was kidnapped long back... why? what had happened with her after kidnapp?</comment>

<comment>that was her older sister ruby</comment>

<comment>Indians simply love to establish dynasties. </comment>

<comment>Shameless BJPee  which abhors and castigates dynastic politics publicly will strangely not find vices in this latest instance of  impulsive indulgence of dynastic  politics just because the presumptuous  Nationalists are now  in alliance with a Seperatist Party !!Hypocrisy and double standards thy name is Bjpee, a theatre of the absurd !!</comment>

<comment>Mehbooba Mufti is part of the People's Democratic Party and the BJP has no control over her appointment.  Moreover, the other people are Islamic sympathizers of Pakistan and Bangla Desh, while the Mufti family is as Indian as Chapathi Kurma, MAsal Dosai and Idly Vadai.</comment>

<comment>Either you are probably ignorant of the antecedents of Mufi and PDP or trying the familiar game of deceit and deception.  If you just rewind the past, you can easily notice the kind of insinuations made by even yr BJPee leaders themselves against the Mufi led PDP where it was derided as anti National and sympathetic to the Porkis and seperatists. Now you hypocrites and double tongued celebrate them as Nationalists. It  is also worthy to recall the Rubiya hijacking episode where five dreaded terrorists were released in exchange for the release of Mufti's daughter where he was the Home Minister of National Front Govt., and the shrill battle cries made by yr party then railing against it and terminh Mufti as a traitor while still shamelessly supporting the National Front Govt., then !!</comment>

<comment>.... and corruption. </comment>

<comment>Ha ha.. you did not see dynastic when Omar Abdullah and Mufti got almost all the seats in kashmir region,dude dynasty is not a BJP problem, its indian problem, indians keep voting dynasties..</comment>

<comment>Are you new to politics?  Why cuss only bjp when all parties do it. Bjp is not dynastic. Happy with that...</comment>

<comment>Simple, it is the BJPee which makes so much fuss about dynasty politics !!</comment>

<comment>Yeah and their leadership is not. Compared to the congis this is nothing....</comment>

<comment>Your perception is night robbery is better than day light robbery.  But the fact is robbery is itself a crime and immoral act !!</comment>

<comment>My perception is corruption between usa and india. Us is also corrupt. But we all know which one is better...</comment>

<comment>'Not dynastic' what about the reject Gandhis that have been absorbed? Mother who slaps forest official, son who makes hate speeches? </comment>

<comment>I meant the leadership and worktyle. I did not mean there is no shred of dynasty or nepotism. Even AAP has that...</comment>

<comment>Is repulsive prostration not enough where every thing for the Chaddis is Feku, Feku and Feku deluding themselves and hating the World which is not prepared to share and endorse their myth of a man with a magic wand who can transform the lives of about 1.4 billion sitting in the confines of Lutyens of Delhi with frequent World tours as an infatuated obsession !!</comment>

<comment>You are totally blabbering and making no sense...</comment>

<comment>Only just making an terse statement without substantiating it makes little sense !!</comment>

<comment>BJP is not dynastic. Does not mean they dont have any kind of father son duo. The party has been mostly free of it unlike one family that has ruled across 4 generations! What kind of comparison is this? BS...</comment>

<comment>As on many other issues, where this Party and its leaders have shown a tremendous disconnect between tall words and action, on the dynasty issue too, it is this party which makes such hue and cry over it and slams it as immoral and yet fails to stick to that lofty principle !!But it is quite  evident that  the masses misunderstood what the BJP really meant when it claimed  it abhors dynastic politics.  Dynastic politics will stick only when it is practiced by the Congress while other parties which blatantly adopts such course will be condoned or remain totally immune to criticism !!It is also a misnomer that there is no dynastic politics in BJP when the facts are the other way around. Many Sons and daughters have come up in this Party through the easy route purely on account of their Parent's tall standing in the party.  For instance, you can take the current CM Vasundharaje Scinda who is the daughter of Vijayaraje Scindia who was in a prominent position in the party and was its Vice President. Similarly, you have Maneka Gandhi and her Son Varun admitted and given prominent position in the party purely due to their dynastic orientation and popularity out of it. Many sons and daughters of top BJP leaders have been given prominence in ticket distribution and Ministry making primarily on account of their parental lineage.  Pankaj Munde is one example and similarly you have the Son and daughter of the Late Pramod Mahajan enjoying elevated status in the party. I can cite numerous examples to substantiate my claim that it is a myth that the BJP  doesn't practice dynastic politics when its deplorable practices are  rampant within the party overriding loyalty and merit  !!</comment>

<comment>May she succeed in bringing peace and normalcy to the troubled land. Let us wish her success.</comment>

<comment>DYNASTY</comment>

<comment>Only kashmir ?ðŸ˜„</comment>

<comment>She loved her father dearly. Now, she should start loving the state and more importantly the nation.</comment>

<comment>you forgot her fathers 'friends, well wishers, and patrons' in Kashmir and from Pakistan</comment>

<comment>The family is good and patriotic, and has no connection with  bad elements.</comment>

<comment>why no news or updates about Malda rioting when Dadri lynching is still being discussed on ur front page........9 muslims have been arrested and let off within hours but a BJP elected person was arrested as a preventive measure....shame on u nd ur journalism....shame on us.</comment>
