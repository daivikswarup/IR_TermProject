<comment>Again, just a ploy to stay in news somehow without doing actual work for the lone state currently ruling ?Left ruled Tripura and its youths continues to suffer everyday from chronic unemployment and concerned folks are just happy to mint Govt salary month after month with an excuse of unemployment is throughout country or no infrastructure - at the cost of tax paid by general public. Wondering how long it will continue ?With a record (highest in India) 25.2% of unemployment Left ruled Tripura continues to bite dust of under-development and non-performance due to state's outdated policies of being anti development and industry without realizing world and India's economy driven by Business and technology.So far it has been about Govt job, salary, subsidy - on tax payers money and mediocre plastic industry for name sake being the focus - which still fails to show hope to lakhs of educated unemployed youths!Need is to bring high end industry and jobs at Agartala having follow up with Industry leaders and setting up required infrastructure on a war footing.With high speed internet and 24/7 power, Can capital Agartala look forward in 2016 to being an IT hub with high end IT jobs for 7 lakh educated unemployed youths of Trpiura ?</comment>

<comment>It is logically wrong to allow communist parties to function in a multi party democracy as they are for single party dictatorship.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] not a democracy. Free speech can be explosive unless it is a part of movement to uproot the Ocholocracy. In a Ocholocracy INDIVIDUAL rights are murdered by definition with help of state. Examples of murder of INDIVIDUAL right are reservation policy which is murder of merit, an INDIVIDUAL right and socialism(by definition legal robbery) which is murder property right, another INDIVIDUAL right.Why are Indians not trusted with free gun laws as in USA? Answer to this simple question demolishes free speech argument.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why were leftists associated with secessionists? The culture of socialist legal robbery is manifesting itself as secessionism - because the socialists may have realized it is impossible to come to an understanding on who the supreme dictator should be and they want to establish numerous single part dictatorships over fragments of country.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just voting does not make India democracy. Protection of rights of the smallest minority the INDIVIDUAL MAKES A SYSTEM DEMOCRATIC. The problem is, India is an Ocholocracy[mob rule] where Individual rights are murdered[example is murder of merit an Individual right by reservation policy and property rights by socialism. Socialism is legal robbery.A period of good dictatorship may be required to cure Indians of disease of bad democracy, due to the infection of socialism or legal robbery. Otherwise bad democracy can kill in millions like in Cambodia under Pol Pot. Ocholocracy looks like democracy but it is not. Just look at immorality of Indians- Laloo the reason for largest migration of Biharis from Bihar was reelected.</comment>

<comment>We love this diversity talk by the Gandhi scion promptly supported by his commi foe turned friends His family is well known for its socialistic views that can at times sound like making incendiary statements against the state. It was created as a haven for a constituency that will oppose anybody other than the family at the centre. It is easy to work this constituency up if one looks at the benefit they may forfeit should the home ministry come down on them. JNU has room rent @ Rs 11/- per month. Annual fee is Rs 219/- per year payable in 2 installments. Mess bills are subsidised through free manpower and infrastructure. More and more hostels are being made to loot the taxpayer's money and further worsen the problem. 11 hostels were there in1990 now 22. More outsiders and illegal can now stay in hostels at night.Our media personnel are mostly from this institution; any wonder why so much presstitution goes in the name of JNU. One professor for every 15 students, a luxury our schools don't have. The government spends Rs 3 lakh per student  of JNU from our tax for shouting anti India slogans and pro Pakistan slogans. Aren't we a foolish lot being  a tolerant nation?No wonder the Congress and the Communist are merging in Kolakata and elsewhere to protect their fond institutions.</comment>

<comment>CPI(M) celebrated China's win when India defeated in 1962 Sino-War</comment>

<comment>Prakash karat you and your daughter should be hanged immediately.</comment>

<comment>Communists should not preach about tolerance.  In Banks at least in 80s, the left unions boycotted the other unions in day to day working. Their members will not co-operate with other union members in the day to day working, will not talk to them.</comment>

<comment>Rattled,as their own siege since the last 60 years is coming to an end!</comment>

<comment>Now who the hell is this Karat?</comment>

<comment>Sir. How can you not know this commiee . He is the one who took the comotose CPIM to its grave. We must honour such masters. The fact that he was ex JNU union president and then was a leader of the CPIM speaks volumes of the ideology of the JNU.</comment>

<comment>So he indirectly admits that before BJP came to power Central Universities were under the seize of antinational elements including their own party. </comment>
