<comment>scamgrase shamelessly supporing Hardik Patel in open. but in other states they pose as if they are Robbinhoods of backward classes and dalits. this is the best example of how scamgrase lured backward classes since 60yrs. scamgrase never concerned about their prospects, but interested in only using them as vote banks by spilling peanuts in the form of some welfare schemes. now see how scamgrase literally backstabbing backward classes in gujarat.scamgrase also fooled jats in the same manner. jats reservation provided by scamgrase (just before elections) was turned down by supreme court. scamgresis knew that they wont work. but they just fooled jats.</comment>

<comment>Is Modi campaigning here also???</comment>

<comment>haha...now every by elections and municipal elections have also become a referendum on modi govt for these cheap do takke ke pre**ti**tes...</comment>

<comment>So, you have conceded the defeat... Ha.. haa... haaa.....</comment>

<comment>From now on, the law of diminishing returns will operate for Feku led BJP with increased velocity !!Afterall,  people have now seen through the deceitful game of Feku and are now getting disenchanted sooner than later !!</comment>

<comment>exactly...now the pappu and sonia and their corrupt party will be back with a bang.....</comment>

<comment>It is not "diminishing returns", but the complete rejection by the people of Modi government's socio-political and above all economic policies (and performance) and the divisive RSS ideology... The results of Ratlam by-poll and the civic poll in Gujrat would further fortify the trends emerging from Delhi, Bihar assembly and UP Panchayat polls...</comment>

<comment>complete rejection???hahaha....</comment>

<comment>Can't you read the clear writing on the wall??? Modi even lost 'Jayapur', the much pampered and publicised village adopted by him in his constituency in Varanasi...</comment>

<comment>When did this happen?</comment>

<comment>About 25 days back... Modi-party badly lost 42 seats out of 48 in Zila panchayat elections in PM's constituency Varanasi (including in 'Jayapur')... Though the "National" media almost blacked-out this significant news, in entire UP, where they swept in 2014, BJP was completely decimated in Panchayat elections...</comment>

<comment>And who got elected?</comment>

<comment>Well said !!</comment>

<comment>How people can say ideology of RSS is divisive. Had RSS been of violent, divisive mindset, Muslims would have reduced to less than 5% as are Hindus in Pakistan. They would live in fear, would not dare to have a mosque in every lane and by lane of the country. But facts are different. It is Congress and their sycophant media and intellectuals who try to bad mouth RSS, to please their vote bank. By the way Congress was existing when partition took place, Congress has divided the country on basis of caste, religion and language, still RSS is maligned.</comment>

<comment>"How people can say ideology of RSS is divisive. Had RSS been of violent, divisive mindset, Muslims would have reduced to less than 5% as are Hindus in Pakistan".The RSs' ideology of Hindutva is divisive. Read Savarkar and Golwalkar. The reason the RSS ha not been very successful in reducing Muslims to less than 5%, because it has not been allowed to. Today, with one of its pracharaks as the Prime Minister, it feels beholden. Hence the lynching, killing of rationalists, etc. The RSS is no different from the Taliban.</comment>

<comment>Rubbish. There should have been total transfer of population as suggested by Ambedkar</comment>

<comment>rss is only creating fear in majority community that minorities will take over blah blah , all this to help bjp gets votes from majority , rss must be laughing at this foolishness of their scared supporters who pour out hatred against minority here</comment>

<comment>Sickulars can live in harmony with Muslims who are getting branded as TERRORIST worldwide but can't sand RSS...something that only they understand</comment>

<comment>Shivraj is going to lose Ratlam. His days are numbered too.</comment>

<comment>The only way shivraj will lose ratlam is when you squeal allahuakbar before hugging him and exploding yourself</comment>

<comment>Disappointed with the language of shri shivraj singh Chauhan. I thought him one of few remaining modest and mild speaking persons left in bjp but the language like " koi maa ka laal" proves that I was wrong. Looks like vyapam has taken a lot of toll on him.</comment>

<comment>Using civilised language is not part of the DNA of the RSS/BJP, look at the Narendra Modi, he has been at it since 2002.</comment>

<comment>Hope congress wins let   bjp do the real job as per poll promise..... job creation alll time low</comment>

<comment>On every index BJP has done far far far better than congress ....is there any scale on which congress is better...?? Let them focus on poor state of affairs in Karnataka where hundreds are losing jobs due sever power cuts in banglore</comment>

<comment>Congress has strong hold in Jabua, Sailana and Thandala Tehsil but still Congress lost in LS election with 108000 votes. This time BJP might face tough competition.</comment>

<comment>There is an article in swarjyamag with the heading did bhagwat's comment make a difference in Bihar polls ? Or something similar READ THE only COMMENT on the article ( there are in fact 2 comments but the second is a response ) it gives an excellent analysis of the Bihar results.. If the data represented is true and I think so..</comment>

<comment>Thanks for your comment untildnextFPban:). I went through that comment and it doesn't surprise me. The same happened in Delhi and this is how the other elections are going to be fought. What is disconcerting is the fact that Indians still continue to be glamoured by caste. That seems to be more important that development. Unfortunately, this is not how India as a nation will progress. Anyway, BJP needs to start delivering and communicating better with the masses.</comment>

<comment>That's my take also ,  one they need better media mgmt 2 they need some 3-4 solid deliverables on ground by 2018 year end . .else very unfortunately they are going to go and congees will succeed once again :(</comment>

<comment>They should go for the low hanging fruits like putting Vadra behind bars and taking action against fake Gandhis. This seems to have fallen off the agenda.</comment>

<comment>Janta party did that with Mrs Gandhi after emergency,  she came back with a bang partly on the basis of victim hood !! That strategy also has its pros and cons  :(</comment>

<comment>If that's the case then Modi shouldn't have upped the ante and rhetoric in 2014! People like me will be very disappointed in no action is taken against the money launderers. We must also not forget that Indira Gandhi was a very strong leader which the current Congress party lacks. If Modi does not help deliver justice then no one else can. So many hopes are pinned on the incumbent government to provide a new beginning and inject fresh thinking/ideas. It does not seem to come across at this point in time.</comment>

<comment>Don't get me wrong , I too want bjp to act decisively,  unfortunately I don't believe it will be the low hanging fruit you believe</comment>

<comment>True that, thanks to the countless layers of bureaucracy in India. If no action is taken then it'll be extremely hard for Modi to win in 2019! When he will be campaigning the opposition will raise banners asking questions such as "If Vadra was guilty why is he still scot-free"? A tall ask for BJP from here on. Good to hear that they have put together a team in Assam to head the elections there next year which is ripe for change. They seem to be learning from their recent debacles but media management needs a big overhaul. Our cries seem to be falling on deaf ears unfortunately.</comment>

<comment>The country needs to get rid of this Khangress and their caste politics</comment>

<comment>get rid of chatur varna ,abolish caste names</comment>

<comment>Varna and caste are different idiot. !! Read Ambedkar if you don't believe me...</comment>

<comment>whatever varna or caste ,abolish their names</comment>

<comment>We want to , that's the goal of Hindutva. To organize all Hindus regardless of caste , all under one flag.  But you are so busy demonizing us , that you can't see the whole picture.</comment>

<comment>i hope the best , but is there any one who will oppose writing caste names ?</comment>

<comment>I am not sure about what you mean by caste names ?? Please explain</comment>

<comment>which signifies varna or caste ,mostly sir names</comment>

<comment>Like people using Bihmrao  ??</comment>

<comment>Not only caste politics but politics of lies !!</comment>
