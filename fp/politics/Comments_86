<comment>JATS never participated in our freedom struggle ,and as a matter of fact they supported the colonial British Raj.Jat agitation is nothing but resorting to criminal tactics, looting arson holding entire public and public system at ransom.Justifying their arsonist behavior to press upon their not so justifiable demand of quota for Jat's. is yet another reservation ghetto.Comparison's with other reservation beneficiaries ,challenging Indian Army who are their to maintain law and order.Jat agitation is yet another disgrace just to have your ADHIKAAR and no KARTAVYA towards the country and other simple citizens.   Daily commuters ,old women , small children's were made to suffer as a result of their nonsensical way of protest damaging your own state of Haryana and its property is not a act of sanity  or permissible by any reason or rhyme."LET BETTER SENSE PREVAIL"</comment>

<comment>Its all done by Congress Hooda.. he escaped as if he did really escaped.. Nope its all trash.. Congress did these kind of tactics in Hyderabad  every time it wants to come back to the power.</comment>

<comment>Can any one explain economic social and educational differences between YADAVS, JATS and Sainis ?No one. i know. Then why not Jats to be included in OBC list.Dirty politics. And this dirty politics will create situation like Panjab and Kashmir. Around 80 young children died by Indian Army. More than 500 injured. Are we pakistanis ?No water cannon.........No rubbers bullets.....Firing on head.......bullshit.Come on army..how many are you just 13 lakhs toal. We are 9 crore around delhi.If anyone spoiled us no one will be  safe. Either it be parliament or Delhi itselfAll tax looted communities are barking against us. We do not fear from Army even tanks.Give our right or either create population based reservation.No one in media asking the prosperity of Yadav Singh ?WHY?</comment>

<comment>We all know who is behind all this aggression. first in Gujarat, then in hydrabad university, then in JNU and now haryana. Do not let this government function. No progress for the country, and do not let anything happen in parliament and then blame Modiji for everything.</comment>

<comment>The nightmares of 1947 revisited the peaceful and hard working Punjabi Community. Whatever you write or debate the lives of business class is ruined again. I request them to leave Rohtak, Jhajhar, Sonipat, Jind, Kaithal and migrate to Bhiwani, Sirsa, Karnal, Panipat, Kurukshetra and other districts. It can happen again any time, raise yourself as law enforcement agencies are meant to protect politicians only. You are welcome to these districts where modern looteres are in less numbers.</comment>

<comment>This Chooda himself was very much involved in time fixing.</comment>

<comment>Ohkk.. if the tape authenticity is verified.. this is gonna blow up things big time.. However, knowing how thick skinned politicians are.. I wonder whether the culprits would be apprehended and would given a big time punishment.. these dumbf*** JATS have ruined the image of Haryana.. This shows how literate they are (sarcasm here)... Bloody JAT-Buddhis.. I feel sorry for those 18 who lost their lives, but no sorry for they followed some mindless JAT leader who probably does'nt have a brain and just utilized these  lives as disposable ones.. These JAT leaders should compensate the family of those who lost their lives.. Why take from the Govt. ??? U ruin things, cause a huge loss to the State in the tune of Thousand Crs... Huge inconvenience to the mass at large.. These guys should be wiped out entirely..</comment>

<comment>Is it not fair to assume that the knew each and every timing, when the protestors will on rampage was a time set by them and they timed their exit too.</comment>

<comment>OPINIONSAn open letter to Rajdeep “IAmAntiNational” SardesaiBy vivekagnihotriPosted on February 19, 2016Dear Rajdeep,It seriously doesn’t matter to me what’s your self-image: Nationalist or anti-nationalist. I don’t even care what people think about you. I don’t even see a reason why an honest journalist needs to advocate his ideologies in a national newspaper’s op-ed page. I don’t even know how many honest journalists can get this opportunity of ‘self-promotion’ as most of them are vernacular, non-lutyens journalists, struggling to find news in scorching heat of India that exists outside of Delhi.Since your article is based on an absolutely wrong premise, besides self-pity, I think, as a true nationalist, its my duty to correct it and put it in right perspective before your lie becomes the mainstream narrative.You write:“In the 1990s, the country’s polity was divided by secular versus pseudo secular faultlines; now, another divide, and frankly far more insidious, is sought to be created between ‘national’ and ‘anti-national’ forces.”In the 1990s, the country was divided between haves and have-nots. That’s why the main theme was ‘Garibi Hatao’. As it still does. Then liberalization happened. With liberalization, India got divided on a new fault line. Ones who wanted to make a better livelihood by working hard and those who wanted to milk liberalization with corruption. Corruption requires middlemen, brokers, pimps and sycophants. Thus a group mushroomed, disguised in the garb of secularism and unfortunately you chose to become their voice. Indians have been secular for thousands of years. I hope you know, words like ‘religion’ and ‘secular did not even exist until the advent of Christianity. I am sure your grandfather must have told you that Hindu civilization existed even thousands of years before Jesus Christ.‘Secularism’ was a tool that corrupt Congress and the beneficiaries of its corruption used to protect ‘the ecosystem’ from millions of hungry, unemployed, exploited, oppressed but honest, hard-working common citizens. Secularism was invented to consolidate minority votes without isolating Hindus and without appearing to be a minority appeaser. With liberalization, came new multi-national businesses who wanted to overcome red-tapism and needed licenses whereas the ruling parties needed funds. Coincidentally, at the same time English news channels were also in red so they also needed funds. So news channels with power to make or break images needed money and corrupt Congress with money needed image. Thus emerged a new group – The Secular group.Anyone who disagreed with their ‘Idea of (corrupt) India’ was labelled non-intellectual and thus the middle class, vernacular Indian who did not have the privilege to study in St. Xaviers, Christchurch, Doon, Scindia, Oxford or Cambridge was made to feel inferior in his own country. They were typecast as illiberal, regressive Hindus. Supporting Pakistan was seen as intellectual. Rejecting Hindu customs and traditions became an intellectual exercise. People who take pride in Hindu philosophy were systematically labelled ‘illiberal’. You were seen protecting, promoting and nurturing such voices.Rajdeep, your grandfather must have also told you that everything that is traditional isn’t illiberal. Similarly, everything that’s rebellious in nature isn’t liberal. But Secular India had silenced the grandfathers of India. On TV channels, for sure. That’s how India was divided between organized and funded club members of a ‘Secular India’ and unorganized, simple, honest and truly secular Indians. They were denied entry into mainstream narrative of India. Nobody was talking for them. Nobody was listening to them. It was by design. You were one of the designers.Since you love old Hindi songs you must have heard ‘Jiska koi nahin uska to khuda hai yaaron…’ and khuda listened to this hapless mass. A technological innovation came as their rescue. Social media happened. Of course, the secular brigade tried to monopolize it but the entry was open to all. It wasn’t a club. It was a platform. When so-called ‘smart trolls’ started exposing your secular club members of their lies and sinister intents, your wife tried to humiliate them and create further divide by labelling them as ‘Internet Hindoos’.They weren’t Hindoos. They were Indians. They wanted to take pride in India. And you wanted to crush that pride. For that pride would have been counter productive to thekedars of ‘idea of India’. Two ideas, two Indias came out in open. One who loved India. And another who loved ‘idea of India. That’s how ‘nationalist’ and ‘anti-nationalist’ debate started. Nobody called you anti-national. You decided to ridicule nationalists. You started calling Modi supporters as ‘sanghis’, bhakts, and pseudo patriots, without even realizing that these people love Modi for he is a India Bhakt. They will drop Modi the day they doubt his integrity.You misunderstood that Modi bhakts are also BJP, RSS bhakt. Your fundamentals were wrong. That’s why it took one evening of prime time for one of your ex-colleagues to demolish your game. Today you have become a victim of your own game. You have sensed that being anti-Hindu, anti-India is not paying dividends and it’s too late for you to be called nationalist. You don’t have credibility, and now it’s a matter of survival for you. If your grandfather was alive, he would have warned you that the race you, Arvind Kejriwal, Rahul Gandhi and friends are running ends only in a dark well. Where even penance doesn’t help.Nothing can be a more resounding proof than the fact that today you have to use an op-ed page to publicly justify your ideological defeat with a vicious hashtag #IAmAntiNationalist You write:“Yes, I am anti-national because in a plural democracy I believe we must have a dialogue with Kashmiri separatists as we must with those in the North-East who seek autonomy. I will listen to student protestors in Srinagar or Imphal as I will to those in an FTII or a JNU.”I would advise you have a dialogue with Arnab Goswami. With Subhash Chandra. Have a dialogue with Bhakts like me. With Internet Hindoos. Have a dialogue with the innocent Modi supporter who you had beaten up at MSG. But listening isn’t your agenda. If it were you, I would have listened to so-called trolls on twitter and understood why they are so angry with me. But you chose to whine all day about trolls and their abuse. If you can tolerate anti-India slogans I am sure you can also tolerate some abuse on your TL.On your timeline thousands of ‘trolls’ keep screaming why you don’t show India’s growth story? Did you listen to them?I want to have a dialogue with you. Listen to you. Understand you. But are you ready to invite me? To listen to my point of view?Prosecute all those who break the law, incite violence, resort to terror but don’t lose the capacity to engage with those who dissent. The right to dissent is as fundamental as the right to free speech: shouting down alternative views, be they on prime time TV or on the street, is not my idea of India.Forget Idea of India, first tell us what is India. Is Malda India? Are the states other than Delhi India? Are other CMs not Indian CMs? Is Ramchandra Guha the only Indian intellectual? Or the death of a journalist who was burnt for exposing corruption less secular than the lynching of Akhlaq? Or the turmoil, conflict, negativity, opposition, communalism, intolerance, awards wapsi… only themes of India?Is Nemo the only dog in India?If your channel is the only source of information, one would die believing India is Delhi. Modi its villain. Ramchandra Guha its Buddha. Kejriwal  its Christ plus Prophet. Those 5-6 panelists as Supreme Court. Regressive Hindus are killing innocent Christians, Muslims, Dalits, writers and now poor students. Rest of the population is starving without beef. And Sonia Gandhi never existed.My grandfather told me a journalist’s only requirement is integrity. Integrity isn’t honesty. Integrity is the ability to tell the truth even when no one is listening. When was the last time you raised real issues of India? When was the last time you made your viewers hear a common man’s concerns. Hate Modi. Hate RSS. Hate Bhakts. Hate Hindus. But why this complete blackout of ‘Rest of India’. Do you work for ‘India Today’ or ‘Delhi Today’?Yes, I am anti-national because I don’t believe in doublespeak on issues of nationalism. If support for Afzal Guru is to be seen as ‘sedition’, then at least half the erstwhile Cabinet in Jammu and Kashmir, where the BJP is in coalition with the PDP, would be held guilty.I absolutely agree with your logic. And by that logic, and no doublespeak, you must also hold Arvind Kejriwal guilty for having partnered with Congress and Congress for partnering with Owaisi and Nitish for partnering with Lalu. Even you must be held guilty for partnering with corrupt and crony capitalist Ambani and your wife for partnering with your unethical enemy group: Times of IndiaWhat you have failed to understand is that ‘is hamam mein sab nange nahin hai, yeh nangon ka hamam hai’. You are one of them. If the Kashmiri youth today see Afzal as someone who was framed, they should be challenged to a legal and political debate but can they be branded as ‘jihadists’ simply because their views are repugnant to the rest of the country? You are again confusing issues. It’s not about Afzal. It’s about India. It’s about ‘India go back’. India ki barbadi’ ‘ India tere tukde honge’. It’s about that. Afzal, sedition law, FoE, Lawyers’ hooliganism etc are games journalists like you play to shift focus, confuse issues and keep the ‘ecosystem’ protected.It’s about terrorism. It’s about alleged terror links of some students. It’s about supporting terror groups. It’s about terror funding. It’s about threat to India’s sovereignty. That’s why people are concerned. Leave sedition laws for the court. You tell us where do you stand? Without any buts. If you are seen protecting the rights of these allegedly terror-linked students, or seen spinning this news and covering them up, you won’t have to put any hashtag, because soon you will become a hashtag yourself – of all anti-nationals. Yes, I am anti-national because while I am a proud Hindu who wakes up to the Gayatri mantra, I also like a well done beef steak, which, according to BJP minister Mukhtar Naqvi, is a treasonous act, enough to pack me off to Pakistan. I celebrate the rich diversity of my country through food: Korma on Eid, pork sorpotel with my Catholic neighbours in Goa during Christmas and shrikhand during Diwali is my preferred diet. The right to food of my choice is again a freedom which I cherish and am unwilling to cede.Unfortunately, your understanding and definition of Hinduism is limited to Gayatri Mantra, beef steak and shrikhand.  The day you will understand Hinduism you will regret that you had to waste all your productive life to learn secularism, tolerance, inclusiveness, nationalism etc. when all this wisdom was available in your grandfather’s diaries. Post-script: Last week, at the Delhi Gymkhana litfest, I suggested that the right to free speech must include the right to offend so long as it doesn’t incite violence. A former army officer angrily got up and shouted, “You are an anti-national who should be lynched right here!” When even the genteel environs of the Gymkhana club echo to such strains, we should all be very worried.I don’t know much about club culture but I know one thing for sure: when journalists stop travelling beyond their studios to reporting facts, fighting over TRPs instead of truth, and using media to further their agenda or to defend and justify themselves, we should all be not just very worried but take time out to introspect.The other day I was invited to a Times Now panel for an Arnab Goswami show where he was exposing the hypocrisy of Indian seculars and liberals. My views about Indian Secular gang are well-known and I expressed them frankly. Next morning, while walking in my park without a dog, a gentleman called me ‘bhakt’. Exactly like you do. Do you know, in Hindu philosophy, Bhakti is a human quality, attained only by honest people. He accused me of being critical of award wapsi gang who hate intolerant Hindus who support Modi and that too on a Arnab Goswami show who is exposing those who hate India and Modi who loves India and who has the support of Hindus who love India which is also loved by Modi…If supporting India means supporting Modi and vice versa then I’d rather be called a ‘bhakt’ than being seen exchanging notes with terror support groups.Yes, #IAmABhakt, of IndiaVivek Agnihotri is a filmmaker, writer and columnist. His next film ‘Buddha In A Traffic Jam’ deals with Naxalism at India’s premier institutes.Vivek tweets at @vivekagnihotri</comment>

<comment>It will take a little time to recover financial losses, But it will take a long time to regain you lost respect. I hope you understand who lost finance and who lost respect.</comment>

<comment>bjp government totally bent down in front of looters jat.haryana fooled by modi and khattar</comment>

<comment>Vote for Kaniaya Kumar as PM..Army Generals beat a retreat. You call talk sedition [based on a colonial law]. Talk does not harm but action does. What do you call anti-national activities of Jats. What do you call anti-national parliament and constitution. You did nothing when VP Singh made the constitution anti National. You see the effect today and what will they say against Modi who wants to be another VP SIngh. I strongly suspect that Modi and rajnath SIngh want to sell their supporters and bring in private sector reservations.Army Genrals what did you do when emergency was imposed an dsocialism[legal robbery] was introduced into constituion under orders from KGB?</comment>

<comment>Why audio tape not yet become big national news</comment>

<comment>congress controlled paid   media</comment>

<comment>Colours of congressman today.</comment>

<comment>These stupid looters are biggest threat then terrorist . we need to go for  capital punishment for such kind of persons but again all politically motivated . </comment>

<comment>They will be given 25 lac for getting killed while looting and arseing and job for family members. BJP Sarkar gave them free run for three days.Next round they will beat all other communities for week when SC declines their quota bid again.Be ready for next round in few months as BJP would not ask police and army to act while rioters will have field day I mean week.</comment>

<comment>Nicely written with facts and figures, better than usual rants by other authors.</comment>

<comment>Sab log rights k liye lad rhe he koi ,as an Indian citizen k duty kya hoti he uske liye bhi koi ladega kya ..aaj tak esi koi bhi community he jo rights k jagah duty ke liye protest kar k dikhaya ho...:))</comment>

<comment>No matter how much you people criticize the Jats or give a political twist to every issue, but the reality is that slowly and steadily most of the general category has become ''the untouchables of 21st century''..the irony of this country is, the one who scores 80-90% commits suicide or is unemployed and the one who scores 40% gets the job and keeps exploiting the quota even when he/she becomes economically well, set aside the nepotism that takes place thereafter...its a sleeping time bomb, much worse is yet to come...but nobody wants to address the real issue...RIP India</comment>

<comment>this stir is less about communalism but more about congress trying to make its mark in obc area</comment>

<comment>its an 23 year old issue..</comment>

<comment>brahmano ki lanka lag gayi hain malik</comment>

<comment>you mean RSS?</comment>

<comment>nahi be, normal vanila brahman, rss mix hain</comment>

<comment>magar yeh kis ke reference mein tha? kaun hain yeh vanila brahman, yeh toh bata?</comment>

<comment>ordinary brahman living in India uske reference mein</comment>

<comment>OK yaar</comment>

<comment>Just shows you know nothing about RSS!! Modi himself is from backward class.. He is from OBC.. now i am sure you didn't knew about that!!</comment>

<comment>LOL, the other guy said ''brahmano ki lanka'', i just asked him what he meant by that? don't be judgmental</comment>

<comment>Nope.. not being judgemental.. you said.. you mean RSS? when Baba said - Brahmano is lanka... so was just a logical deduction.. :)</comment>

<comment>haha he said brahmano ''ki'' lanka, not ''is''...of course its logical, RSS is the only one that is called ''Brahman organization'' by most of its critics</comment>

<comment>It's bit obvious what he meant to say is that if everyone gets reservation, then general class will suffer the most. Wat RSS has to do here?</comment>

<comment>thanx for clearing it up...yes, i mentioned RSS, kill me..</comment>

<comment>I wonder.. why don't we see the same MP's and MLAs (the ones who cry loud in support of Reservation) getting treatment done by the same reserved quota Doctors?? why do the Politicians run to an upper caste doctor for their treatment.. just an observation.. anyone got any idea??</comment>

<comment>They go to neither an upper caste or a lower caste doctor. Whenever they can they go abroad to get treated by a non Indian doctor. So much for nationalism. </comment>

<comment>No one till date knows, where Sonia went for which treatment.. though a senior Dr in Apollo was found saying that she survived cervical cancer!! and for that Indian Govt.. MMS's govt paid huge amount of money for her secret treatment at Boston.. but you are right, we would never know the real story!!!</comment>

<comment>Same reason. Atal went abroad for nee replacement surgery on govy. Account.</comment>

<comment>Amazing generation so disrespectful towards an ex PM and a Bharat Ratna.. But what pains me more is you comparing a stalwart like Sh Atal Ji to someone so petty and undoubtedly a thief!! Grow up if you still have a chance!! And to answer yes Atalji went abroad for his treatment on suggestions of senior doctors in Apollo .. And he was a PM when he did that.. Do you know he has been ill for a long time but never used govt money for anything personal.. Shame on you to talk so low of him!!</comment>

<comment>And people say Congress gave us freedom.The transcript of conversion proves that this HOODA is responsible for Haryana riots.CONGRESIS are RATS of British, that's why they established this party of MOLES.All those who are CHAMCHAS of British get Certificate of freedom fighter.While rest like Bhagat SINGH, SC BOSE are considered terrorist.</comment>

<comment>The rioters must be taken care of by the army.  These people cannot be allowed to loot the country and kill people at random in large numbers. Restoring law and order is very important under the circumstances. A few body bags sent home after the army attack in American manner would probably solve the problem for ever.</comment>

<comment>After Forming gov in Pujab AAP will supply water from Punjab to Delhi so do not have to relay  only on Haryana </comment>

<comment>we will piss on aap from rest of India, Arvindra kejriwaal will use his jhadu to sail on it</comment>

<comment>AAP is going to loose in Punjab.. INC has hired poll expert who made Nitish win in Bihar and Modi in center.. why couldn't AAP be smart for once and hire the right person for the right job.. AK's ego is going kill AAP as a party!!</comment>

<comment>R u congress supporter ?</comment>

<comment>Any true "Hindustani" can never be a INC supporter.. In-fact.. i hate INC and AAP at the same level coz they both are brothers from different mothers.. they are same behind the scene but on the face of it try to act different!! AAP is a new brand launched by INC and its core team.. AK is just playing in there hands... unfortunately many can't see it..</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal made 3 huge mistakes in the last one month which will cost him Punjab.1. He hugged Jagdish Tytler. It is in public domain.2. He insulted Hanuman Ji. Many Hindus are really pissed off with him.3. His support for JNU terrorists. With Punjab having huge military population, this will affect him badly.</comment>

<comment>For all INC and AAP supporters.. here is the entire transcript from TOI.. no need of thanks, we are bhakts.. bhakts of India!!FYI, Virender singh is a known close aide of HoodaTranscript of the conversation:Telephone operator: Kaptan sahib, ek minute, professor Virender ji bat karenge (Captain sahib, professor Virender Singh will speak to you).Captain Man Singh: Haan sir, karwa do (Yes sir, please do).Virender Singh: Haan, Kaptan sahab namaskar.Captain Man Singh: Good evening sirVirender Singh: Kaise ho? (How are you).Captain Man Singh: Fine sir.Virender Singh: Ye Kaptan sahab apane ilake me to bada achhaa chal raha hai, Deshwali belt me. Inko kaho, INSO (Indian National Student Organisation, student organisation of INLD) ke ladko ko, INSO walon ko ki tum samarthan ka to drama karte ho aur Sirsa ke gaavon me ek kidi bhi nahin rok rakhi thamane. (It (the agitation) is going well in our area. In Deshwali belt (Hisar, Jind and other area), ask boys of INSO, INLD men that you do drama of support (to the Jat stir) but you have not blocked even an ant in the villages of Sirsa.Captain: Achha karta hun, men. Haan sir, karta hun sir. (OK sir, I will get down to it). (VIP car siren is heard)Virender: Hooda sahab ne diya to tab to aarthik aadhar par mango the, aab keh rahe ho ki vahi do jo Hooda ne de rakhya hai. Ye to nahi lekin, wo yeh kahenge, keh hi rahe hain. Hamara swad kyon le rahe ho, tum apane ilakon me kyon nahi karate (When Hooda had given (reservation), they (INLD) were asking (quota) on economic terms but now they are asking for what Hooda had given. Why are they making fun of us, why don't you spread it in your areas?).Captain: Abhi karwata hun, sir. Sirsa side me nahi ho raha na, sir (I will get it done now, sir. It's not happening in Sirsa, sir!)Virender: Han Sirsa me to nahi ho raha. Sirsa me karwao (Yes it's not happening in Sirsa. Get it done in Sirsa).Captain: Thik hai sir. Abhi kahan se bol rahe ho sir. (Ok sir. Where are you speaking from now? (Phone disconnected)</comment>

<comment>Agreed..It was a masterstroke by Delhi police.It was pre-planned by Pappu and Khujili that these guys would return to JNU and do nautanki and escalate it.They calculated wrong.And these naxal & Jihadis made delhi police look like good people for a change!!</comment>

<comment>Wasn't 'divide & rule' supposedly invented and used exclusively by colonial British raj?How much black money was generated from these deals? In which foreign tax haven is it hidden?This latest incident has left 19 dead and drinking water supply to the nation's capital disrupted. As a solution to strife across the country, a  new 'Referendum Act' will empower people. Let people decide - "Do you want caste based reservations (Yes/No)?".The people of UK have a Referendum Act and will decide whether they want to remain in the EU.

<comment>India must have 2 years of compulsory military service. Then people will realize the importance and cost of freedom.</comment>

<comment>there is a theory, i am not getting the link right now, that France lost so easily to Germany in world war I because of compulsory army service in france, whereas in Germany it was voluntary. So when it was voluntary, the people joining army are motivated and work hard. Whereas in France, many people who joined did not really want to join the army. So they were demotivated. Besides these involuntary soldiers also required a lot of 'supply' of food, so each soldier got less food, whereas in the German case, the army size was smaller, so they could get more food per soldier.What happened when the actual war started, was many french soldiers ran away or did not know the proper tactics to fight or were cowards, because majority of the army was composed of compulsory recruits. Germans won easily,despite smaller army, because they were composed of people willing to fight, had more food per capita, hence more stamina and were more brave and courageous.</comment>

<comment>Maybe better working conditions and office regulations would make people value their country more.</comment>

<comment>But they must know the cost of such luxury and experience it first hand.</comment>

<comment>The cost of such luxury is research and development, not the army. In fact the army itself needs R&D. It's better to check the failing institutes and kick out the fat managers and so called "senior engineers" who are doing nothing useful.</comment>

<comment>Israel has compulsory enlistment, does it lack behind in R&D? You could argue it is because of US support but that is not entirely true.1 or 2 years of compulsory service would teach people the cost of freedom then you won't have people joking "My name is Umar Khalid and I am not a terrorist".</comment>

<comment>And you'd actually like living in Israel? We can only be prepared if soldiers do soldiers work and an engineer does the work of an engineer and a doctor his own work. Which 2 years would you like to make compulsory? 18 - 20? 16 - 18?</comment>

<comment>Maybe 19-21.</comment>

<comment>Supreme Court blasts Delhi water minister Kapil Mishra for doing nothing and rushing to the court to get relief</comment>

<comment>Modi got only 14%</comment>

<comment>It's VDPA survey not AAP</comment>

<comment>Come on.. we all know how AAP works.. it was AAP survey using AAJtak.. i am sure you guys have also noted..INC has hired the same guy to made Nitish kumar win Bihar and Modi win center.. so likelihood of AAP win in Punjab just became near '0'</comment>

<comment>so you can not control one Hooda? you talk of Pak and china.</comment>

<comment>Well, he successfully has divided the society. And I'll blame govt. for not having proper administration in place, letting the arson and violence go on for days.</comment>

<comment>Audio is out.. its on Times of India about hooda's involvement in this whole thing!!</comment>

<comment>This guy literally has instigated people to go after Punjabis - community to which CM Khattar belongs. I am not a Khattar sympathizer but targeting innocent people and their livelihood on the name of protest and arakshan is wrong. Social fabric of Haryana, especially Rohtak will never be same. Huge distrust among Jat - Non Jats created. I hope people understand this political game of few cunning politicians like Hooda or Chautala.</comment>

<comment>Kejriwal said that day he wants Indian govt to stay out of affairs of Punjab and Delhi.</comment>

<comment>India needs to have a serious discussion about Kashmir with a end result in mind. Not with Pakistan, not with UN, but with people of India. The question raised and slogans shouted are genuine concerns of the kashmiri people. We need to take them into confidence and question ourselves. The JNU students are raising some uncomfortable questions to this government.1. Is this fight really for kashmiri people? 2. Is it worth even a single soldier's life?3. When Afzal guru was hung, did you wait and think how this is going to play out and affect the young kashmiri's?4. Did you not inadvertently create more Afzal guru's?5. Does hanging and shooting terrorists resolve issues?6. Isn't this a myopic way of dealing with problems which have festered since 70years?7. Isn't Indian government responsible for the lives of our soliders? 8. Soliders have no choice or say in this matter, they are put in harms way under difficult circumstances and conditions. All for what? In the name of nationalism? 9. Why should they fight this battle that can be completely avoided?10. Not all battles are worth fighting.  Sometimes it is best to cut your losses and move on. Unimaginable amount of resources are being drained in name of nationalism. Human life has lost its value battling unnecessary wars. Why should anyone fight this war?  10. Stupidity is doing the same thing and expecting different results. </comment>

<comment>Students should sacrifice their lives for being 'anti-national'; Modi can then only keep his student soul live always.</comment>

<comment>Strange, most of us believe that Students should study.. you seem to have given them completely new direction by saying - Students should sacrifice their life?? PhD guys having time to yell slogans?? MTech, MSc, MS, MA guys having time to indulge in politics and no one finds anything wrong in that?? amazing...</comment>

<comment>What they are doing is exactly studying. You fail to see that these students don't just need knowledge from textbooks to make a living. They are learning life by actively engaging with the society outside the four walls of their classrooms and homes. They are out of their comfort zones which you and i relegate ourselves to. These are individuals who will shape our nation, our future. You and I as Indians are raised so, that we don't create ripples on water. To change our society we need Tsunami of different thoughts and ideas. </comment>

<comment>I agree with you. Mero is really playing fiddle.

<comment>the man who called Jats as suwar ke bacche is BJP's MP not of congress...</comment>

<comment>how can you expect any human behaviour from Modi party?</comment>

<comment>hmm, bahut kuch abhi hona hai, dekhte jao...</comment>

<comment>so they have set the precedence of solution of just/unjust demands with employment of naked and absolute violence.</comment>

<comment>Hooda KI g@nd me do 4 JOOTA</comment>

<comment>Again ran away from me?</comment>

<comment>Hi tattu, how are you? after your torture vikram closed down his account...</comment>

<comment>Doing good machi. How are you? No, I saw Vikram yesterday.</comment>

<comment>His last response was tht he is closing his account. Not sure what happened...</comment>

<comment>Oh, really? But, I came in yesterday and he came in when I was about to leave. I don't know what happened.</comment>

<comment>Me neither. I asked him why. He seemed to be very emotional. Did you see him today?</comment>

<comment>Nope, I just came in 15-20 min ago.</comment>

<comment>the real agenda of the BJP today stands exposed..that b@stard bjp MP RK saini is still a free man, who addressed the Jats as ''suwar ke bacche'' in one of his speeches to his supporters, ab jab reaction aaya toh BJP ki fatt gayee...the reality is BJP has got nothing to offer to this country</comment>

<comment>Hooda is MODERN RAKSHASHe is LAUGHING today while taking bath in blood of innocent JATSHe is the real life DEVILAnd all his followers are demons Son of SatanHuman Blood drinker, cannibals..</comment>

<comment>get lost bhakt</comment>

<comment>Eat my $hitSon of B@STARD HOODA</comment>

<comment>abey bhaag yahaan se modi ke langot, i'm not a haryanvi i'm from delhi..</comment>

<comment>Look like when HOODA visited DelhiHe sowed HIS evil sperm in SOME DRAIN </comment>

<comment>yeah, that drain was your mumma's pu$$y and then a troll like you popped out...now get lost if can't hear the truth..</comment>

<comment>is this a classic example of theory of continuity. no interruptions in disruptions for last two years. now after Jats what is next in the schedule?</comment>

<comment>Congress sponsored terrorism in Haryana</comment>

<comment>First Patels, then Jats , who is next?</comment>

<comment>Modi Bhakts are following Gnyan yoga! negating one by one!</comment>

<comment>Ha ha ha</comment>

<comment>infrastructure destroyed, vehicles, malls and buildings burnt in haryana but did nit disrupt water and power supply to local people. water supply to Delhi was stopped. why?do you want CM of Delhi to take decision on your demands? why? why for your local demands you are putting life of the national capital in jeopardy? why?</comment>

<comment>Is there any moral, any ethics in BJP or Congress? They use public as their satranj ka Mohra! Stupid public loose their lives; these crooks enjoy their VVIP giri!</comment>

<comment>When BJP was in opposition, they blamed congress/UPA for anything and everything - BJP blocked parliament but UPA was responsible for policy paralysis, BJP blocked coal auction but UPA was responsible for coal scam, etc.Modi said 'give me 5 years and I will get you the moon'. Modi has been in power for close to 2 years and the county is a mess. BJP rules most of the states in the north and west of India. And, even now, he keeps blaming the congress for economy, breakdown of law and order, parliament not functioning, etc. If Modi is only going to blame the congress, why can't he resign and do it?</comment>

<comment>Wait for 6 months moreRajya SABHA when reorganizedThen you will See what happens </comment>

<comment>after 6 months, you can say 'wait for another 6 months'. I never ever heard the congress crib. They did all they could and indians prospered, inspite of the BJP ruled states throwing a spanner into all the congress plans.</comment>

<comment>So don't wait and f@ck offOr kill yourself like That loserWho cares ??Bjp won, you lose ??You have to $hit for 3 years like it or not !Even if bjp lose 2019It will come again in 2024Now BJP IS ALTERNATE to all POLITICAL PARTIESLive with the fact !!</comment>

<comment>That is what the BJP told everyone in 2004 - India is shining. But, people knew something else. BJP will find it difficult unless they star carrying everyone along instead of finding reasons to divide people, be it beef or Sanskrit or nationalism or any other meaningless subject</comment>

<comment>I appreciate your confidence. May be, Chaddis will win in TN, Kerala, WB and UP with thumping majority.</comment>

<comment>0+0+0+0=0</comment>

<comment>Before fighting external threats like Pak, ChinaIt is time for starting PURGE to clean INDIA from SC@MBAGS likeHOODA, OMAR & COMMIES</comment>

<comment>Why do you run away from me like a coward?</comment>

<comment>congressis go on rampage while the nation is attacked by the terrorists. the goi must deal with it with absolute firmness and put the congressis on trial asap.</comment>

<comment>20 JATS died for politics of HOODA.HANG THE B@STARDHe is RAKSHASA of KALYUG</comment>

<comment>Hello Mr.Auto Rickshaw.</comment>

<comment>This is low, even by Congress standards. Is there no depth to which they cannot fall to serve their political purpose ? We saw how a statement from Chidambram set Andhra Pradesh on fire. Now we have a deliberate attempt to ferment trouble and provoke a caste war to embarass the BJP government. In a party where the leader , the dim wit, claimed death of seventy persons at Bhatta Parsaul just to get cheap popularity, can Hooda be blamed for merely following in the footsteps of his leader ?</comment>

<comment>Hudda tu to gaya</comment>

<comment>the people must demand investigation and court trial of hooda.</comment>

<comment>the real brahmin agenda of the BJP today stands exposed..that b@stard bjp MP RK saini is still a free man, who addressed the Jats as ''suwar ke bacche'' in one of his speeches to his supporters, ab jab reaction aaya toh BJP ki fatt gayee...</comment>

<comment>Saini ? Brahmin agenda ? Are Sainis Brahmin ? Since when ?</comment>

<comment>abey lodu, saini is not brahmin he is just a scapegoat for the brahmins sitting in nagpur aka RSS</comment>

<comment>He is RAUL MOUTHPIECE, without BRAIN</comment>

<comment>Are you a threaded thug?</comment>

<comment>I am the one , who opened seal of your mother's vagina.</comment>

<comment>ha ha ha. This is what you learnt from your spritual guru Bhagwat. Well done Bhagwat ji.</comment>

<comment>F@ck of you slave race DESERT CULT CONVERT.GO CLEAN TOILET OF KHALIFA</comment>

<comment>I really don't care about your abusive terms Mr.Auto Rickshaw. You never had an answer to any of questions.</comment>

<comment>I am not your ABBUI may have opened hymen of your ammi It is my dog who completed the coitus.So SLAVE RACE of desert find some other</comment>

<comment>How did you learn all these? From your ammi?</comment>

<comment>Hooda is MODERN RAKSHASHe is LAUGHING today while taking bath in blood of innocent 20 JATSHe is the real life DEVILAnd all his followers are demons Son of SatanHuman Blood drinker, cannibals.</comment>

<comment>So are you going to demand reservation for Jats?</comment>

<comment>Yes100% reservation to all HINDU CASTEZero for muzzie</comment>

<comment>But, in temples 100% reserved only to Brahmins. You need to get reservation in temple and need to come and vomit here.</comment>

<comment>Most of Indian guruFrom Ram rahim to Ramdev are non BrahminsIt is old saying by your mula father's that BRAHMINS are headEvery SADHU SADHVI MLA MP of bjp is non Brahmins</comment>

<comment>Ha ha ha. Are you cheating yourself? If you are not aware, the fact is that 100% reservation is given to threads on temples. Keep likking their foot until you die.</comment>

<comment>Yogi ADITYANATH , MATHADHEESH OF biggest HINDU math is non BrahminUMA BHARTI is SC</comment>

<comment>By the way, Adithyanath and Uma Bharthi are dirty politicians. They are not the head of Sabarimala or Shani temple.</comment>

<comment>That's the reason why they don't hold any position in temple. In the history of Hindu religion, did we have one non Brahmin priest in Sabarimala or Trupathy temple?</comment>

<comment>Gorakhpur math is highest authority in NorthSecondly, I don't get it , what is the yearly package of BRAHMINS or RSS chiefWhich Audi car they drive ?Did they get pussieslike QAZIS of MADARSAS & MOSQUES ?All the cream of SADHU layer from Asaram to normal BABA are non Brahmins.I too non Brahmin,but I don't get obsession of you inferior race converted mulas with BRAHMINS.</comment>

<comment>This is not the answer to my question. In the 90 years of history of RSS no non brahmin chief has been elected. Do you say that threaded thugs are the only Patriots in this country qualified to be a chief of RSS?How many threaded priests do you have in your temple and how many unthreaded?</comment>

<comment>First tell me what is RSS ??I don't know about it 5 years back.I started to know when few mulas started shouting about them.As HINDU , RSS is nothing to me.If you want I can abuse Bhagwat too.So don't cry and ask me about RSS.</comment>

<comment>Then, jump to the other part. Reservation given to threaded thugs in temples.</comment>

<comment>I don't know what the term means ??Is it for your REAL FATHER who gangbanged your Pro mother ??</comment>

<comment>So do you have a real father and a virtual father? Wow, strange creature.</comment>

<comment>Modi enjoyed anarchy in Gujarat 2002! Now facing some similar music but not fanatic one!</comment>

<comment>In 2002 it is a purge, to cleanse, muzzie A$SHOLES</comment>

<comment>Even Hafeez Sayeed said the same on 26/11. What's the difference between Hafeez and Modi?</comment>

<comment>Hafeez is your ABBUModi is not2002 MULLAHS get what they deserve</comment>

<comment>So Modi is your Abbu?</comment>

<comment>You can believe, what you want.But 2002 is what Mula A$SHOLES KARMA they were facing.</comment>

<comment>Again, Hafeez says what you say. What's the difference between you and Hafeez?</comment>

<comment>Whatever your ABBU says I don't care.You deserve to get thatJust like US & ISRAEL, pump your a$s with ASSAULT RIFLE.INDIA SHOULD DO THE SAMEOtherwise more MALDA will take place.Every time you mention 2002, every time my answer will be same.You sc@ms burn the train.You should get more severe punishment.</comment>
