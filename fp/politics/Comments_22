<comment>I think JNU is a collective failure on part of government, police, opposition, media, lawyers & we people as Indians. If we cannot accomodate someone's ideology how can we call ourselves Indian. I am ashamed of all who made an issue which should have been dealt by the university & further the land of the law. The government was wrong to direct police to act. The police was wrong in terrorizing the students. The opposition was wrong in taking political advantage of the situation at the cost of country's integrity. The lawyers were wrong in taking law in their hands. The media was wrong in playing the morphed videos & instigating fellow countrymen. And lastly the countrymen are wrong in questioning the concept of nationalism. If you all are so nationalist there are fellow Indians who do not get to eat twice a day. If u think u are nationalist taking the flag on ur hand or chanting bharat mata ki jai show us all your patriotism by helping those who are helpless, empower their mothers & Mother India will automatically be glorified. We shall then be proud of u. I urge u all come & make India a good place for our people & generations to make. This is what makes us Indians. Finally about Umar & Kanhaiya let the law decide where the fault lies. If they are guilty we must direct their energy in positive directions.They surely will make India proud provided we Indians mend their ways if they are wrong & if they are not, we all must stand by them. Jai hind...</comment>

<comment>Umar Khalid or Omar Khalid's older sister, Sarah Fatima, lives in Toronto with her husband and three children. Another older sister Maryam Fatima, is a Ph. D. student in comparative literature at The Univ. of Massachussetts, Amhert. They wear the hijab all the time. Maryam organized a rally supporting JNU at Columbia Univ a week ago. Nowhere does she say it her brother.Like all Muslim radicals, they live a western society and its freedom and comforts, but hate it. Wish to impose sharia, and call RSS-BJP an attack on free speech. When all they want is sharia and no opposition to it. I am writing to the Univ and the govt officials about Maryam. After San Bernardino they are cracking down on such sympathizers.</comment>

<comment>So what explains the slogans raised in JNU... Allahu Akbar along with Inklab zindabad?</comment>

<comment>if he think him self innocent then why hiding ?, if he dares slogons then also face consequences</comment>

<comment>Here in India all the Muslim sympathiser who disguise themselves as Communist and spread hatred against Hinduism.  Have any so call COMMUNIST Muslims and historian Irfan Habib has said anything against Islam. The cover themselves under the disguise of Communism to run their agenda. The are wolfs posing as sheep.</comment>

<comment>Father of Umar Khalid was head of SIMI. Like father like son. He is traitor of Country. From planning under the grab of cultural event to calls to Pakistan and Bangladesh, everything is wrong with this guy. And see whereever muslims are in majority they drive other out. In Pakistan and Bangladesh hindu population is reducing by conversion and forceful marriage of hindu girls with muslims. In Kashmis they drove out all the Pandits. Did UMar ever said anything on these? says he is an atehist, a bigggest joke. What father did in the grab of religion, son wants to it as an atheist and leftist.</comment>

<comment>That is weirdThe only person from that rally who went to jail is not of that religion which is being used to claim victimhood here.</comment>

<comment>I usually do not take posts seriously which are from authors who are professors at JNU, Aligarh Muslim University or are themselves Kashmiri muslims etc. There is no disclaimer here so i will add one to the article - "Sameer Yasir (born 1984) is an Indian Journalist, writer, and political commentator based in Srinagar, the capital of disputed Indian state of Kashmir"</comment>

<comment>change the heading. Umar Khalid is not a kashmiri traitor HE IS AN INDIAN TRAITOR</comment>

<comment>In all these discussions, people and media fail to differentiate between government and nation. You may not agree with government policies, you may criticize and even demonize government and its organs including judiciary, but demonizing your country and wishing its destruction is no-no. Governments come and go, country remains forever.</comment>

<comment>Yea, everything is all right but writer missed one important detail. As per India Today, which by far has been the biggest sympathiser of Umar Khalid itseld admitted that they have call records of Umar Khalid in their possession and as per those, he made 800 calls between 9th and 14th February, of which around 50 were to Bangladesh and Pakistan, and another 50 to Dubai. So much so for him being pious. Now, i am not saying that caling to Bdesh/Pakistan/Dubai is some crime but to project that he's some innocent kid who has no passport and has no contacts with radicals is stretching this way too far.</comment>

<comment>He also made around 60 calls to Honolulu , 25 to Timbuktu and miss calls to Bumpass family.</comment>

<comment>Too bad he didnt use that to make missed call to register as BJP member</comment>

<comment>LOL Good one</comment>

<comment>Umar Khalid said, "what is happening there is Indian occupation of Kashmir."...why people are still supporting him...why people are writing articles eulogizing him...it is pathetic...</comment>

<comment>Father social service? SIMI is social serviceUmar atheist? So?Godse left RSS years before assassinating Gandhi. Still, you blame RSS and Hindu Mahasabha. Savarkar was an atheist but a strong proponent of HindutvaThe post is a white-washing attempt. Shame that a traitor is being feted so much.</comment>

<comment>what do you mean by "they". you guyz can spread BS and nothing else</comment>

<comment>It is sometimes laughable and sometimes painful to see how prejudiced and biased or inhuman some of the comments are in this chain. It is clearly researched and noted that Umer is neither a Kashmiri, nor a believer in Islam, and never had a passport, is a die-hard leftist. So where is the question of he being Islamic Kashmiri terrorist? Second, his father being once a member of SIMI in his young days has nothing to do with him who is openly unIslamic. Further, having contrary views of the Indian state about Kashmir or police atrocities in Chattisgarh may be a fact with thousands of Indians and that is a democratic thing to have different interpretation of major political and state issues of the country. It does not make any one anti-national. Nation and state and government are three different things. In the West also, people have opposed Vietnam or Iraq wars by their own governments in USA and UK and carried out large rallies which forced the govts of these countries to alter policies also. Who is to determine who is national? Those steeped in blindness, ignorance, with no connect with common people on ground?</comment>

<comment>JNU is being portrayed as some kind of University which has a feel of Hogwarth to it. Here students come from all kind of backgrounds with one and only intention of learning the art of dissent so they are more cerebral than general public  , after studies then they can be sent to the sublunary world where they can spread there art form which was hidden from ordinary humans . Umer Khalid is one of the cerebral scholar who is an atheist , so he chants” inshallah" let this country of morons be destroyed , they hanged an intellectual by name of Afzal who on national television declared that he allowed revolutionary thinkers rest in his house and gave them guns and bombs to worship the HOUSE OF AGITATORS (parliament) . What is nation , nations come and go , PEOPLE stay . HE brings the masked vigilantes from the nether to participate in the debate of the year , sorry,POETRY SESSION, for they know their back will be saved by the only intellengitsia among the land of COMMONS the omnipresent media.</comment>

<comment>No point abusing JNU. Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and top two and most favourite two bureaucrats of Modi govt Amitabh Kant Niti Ayog CEO and Foreign Secretary Jaishanker are all JNU products as much as Sitaram Yechury CPIM Gen Secretary is. The entire country is full of politicians, journalists, academics and bureaucrats of JNU background.</comment>

<comment>yes it is a world class UNIVERSITY with present world ranking of 1498 , sorry Sir I am not talking about who is who of JNU but the mindset of students and teachers who can’t even protest against such a exhibition of utter disrespect to university and country . these students flaunted all rules and all of you were mute spectators till it became national headlines .</comment>

<comment>Sorry sir, your hypothesis is that "It is clearly researched and noted" is completly incorrect. Neither has it been researched not noted, it has only been alleged by his family that he doesn't carry a passport. You and i don't know about it. I hope and i really hope he is innocent but such accusations were made by parents of Ishrat Jahan as well that she was innocent, so lets wait till the investigations are over. Finally, absolutely nothing wrong if people have different views or opposing views about governments or state, but to talk about breaking a state into pieces, which btw Umar Khalid subtly said on Arnab's show is no small thing.  And finally to you point that who decides one is nationalist or not, the answer is NO ONE but tell this to those people who have been branding BJP supporters as communal. Who decided then that we were communal?</comment>

<comment>Delhi Police asked by journalists on his passport has already noted that they have found no record of his passport so far. And they have also not furnished any foreign call details of Umer which they had claimed once. In fact, Police has gone silent on that. What Umer said is the right of Kashmiris to decide their future themselves, which is natural normal democratic right, and I and thousands of other Indians also believe it to be a natural right, and which Indian govt represented by PM Nehru had once told the UN as well long back. Scotland recently voted to remain WITHIN UK, but was given the right to do so. The Indian govt due to tactical reasons not allowing (Congress and BJP alike), but there is nothing wrong in a student believing that the right should belong to the people of the region.</comment>

<comment>scotland people are the original inhabitant of that land whereas in Kashmir original inhabitants have been displaced ,so whom to ask for the secession? As for Umar , aniruddh , etc running away will make you look like criminals , may better sense prevail ? kashmir ppl are also voting democratically , and BJP got the larger share , if I m correct ? Final word is don’t make universities hub of anti-national activities</comment>

<comment>Neither has BJP got any larger share in J&K (and not even one seat in Kashmir valley), nor are the original people of Kashmir valley gone anywhere. Half a million Pandits have been unfortunately displaced from Kashmir valley, most of whom are in Jammu, which is a part of the state. No one makes universities hub of anti-nationals. Overdose of emotions. Some stray fringe idiots are everywhere. Indian universities have produced many talents, and JNU is one prominent one producing two ministers and several top bureaucrats of Modi govt also. I am neither a student, former student or faculty of JNU, but am based out of Ahmedabad.</comment>

<comment>Then who will determine nationalism, a bunch of pseudo intellectuals who don't even understand the difference between protesting against government and agitating against the existence of state... a bunch of loud mouthed critics who claim freedom of speech irrespective of the bullshit they utter without any due regards to the legitimate restrictions of the freedom.... or will it be decided by the so called minorities who are always ready to play the victim card to defend all of their acts.... or a bunch of so called innocent students who enjoy the benefit of subsidised education while condemning the very state that provides them benefits and denouncing the sacrifices made by the sentinels of the nation....spend one day with the soldiers proff at the extremes of landscape </comment>

<comment>Go back to history of civilization and you will find that nation and state are NOT the same thing. Nation is represented by people, and State by the government and its machinery. Opposing State is no crime, wanting to break nation is. However, in this case, the students arrested have NOT raised anti-India slogans, but have raised anti-govt slogans, and doctored videos have told the same very loudly. As for soldiers, I am a retired army doctor's son, have been raised in Arunachal Pradesh, and my school Ramkrishna Mission School Aalo (google it) was under Chinese occupation. You are talking of soldier's life, and I have lived it as a soldier's son all my teenage and later.</comment>

<comment>Umer khalid tweets in this country many don't get two meals a day. , He has any theory why it is so.? In states ruled by communists in India nobody is missing a meal ?</comment>

<comment>Khalid  is being played as a pawn by Nehru Gandhi Congress and his Marxist mentors.This episode will end, he will be forgotten by his  so called supporters.They have used him, abused him, and will spit him outHe will be caught sooner or later.People like him who celebrate the murder of 76 police officers deserve little sympathy.Why should the police or lawyers, support him now?Ditto for his colleague Kanhaiya.-  why is he whining about lack of police  protection now?</comment>

<comment>Dear Editor of Firstpost, if you have any sense of Journalistic ethic, you will publish a note on top of this article that the father of Umar was ex-head of SIMI, a banned Islamic fundamentalist outfit that is behind many acts of violence against Indian citizens...even today, his father is head of 'Muslim Personal Law Board' or the Sharia Board...note that NONE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES in the world like USA or UK allow Sharia Islamic law as it discriminates against women (4 women witness equal to 1 man) etc...Why cannot he fight his own father who is supporting laws that are anti-women?Also, the fact that Umar's father was head of SIMI is very important fact in this story but your journalist purposely did not mention in the article!</comment>

<comment>Alos Sharia promoter.And he  claims he is a patriot and dreams of a secular Hindustan?</comment>

<comment>If terror and violence were part of Muslim creed then India should've been a 100% Muslim country after 800 years of Muslim rule. No doubt, it's the falsehood that the misguided chooses over the truth. The truth is that India is heading towards fascism.</comment>

<comment>that had happened but unlike Egypt,Persia where Muslims converted whole countries brutally into Islam, here we had warriors like Shivaji, Sambhaji, Peshwas, Pritviraj Chauhan, Maharana Pratap who ripped Mughals in many ways and saved Hindus....also in some part Mughals did succeed thats how pakistan and bangladesh are Muslim countries....even you are just one of those</comment>

<comment>Delusional and amusing :).</comment>

<comment>How do you think Porkistan and Bangla came into existence? Magic??</comment>

<comment>Forget it, it's beyond the comprehension of self-blinded bhakts.</comment>

<comment>Terrorism and violence are encourage in Islam.</comment>

<comment>Since when did Terrorists require Passports to cross borders? :)</comment>

<comment>Yes he is so innocent and communist..that's what he showed by saying "Bharat ki barbaadi..." and all those rubbish.. Shame on U traitors !!</comment>

<comment>The whatsapp conversation seems so made up.....why is FP trying to make him a hero? he is a perfect fit because he is a muslim? hmmm....kanhaiya is not a muslim...still he is in custody....so stop playing this victim card.</comment>

<comment>Is the author defending terrorism?</comment>

<comment>If he shows up now, the goondas at the court will probably kill him with help from Bassi's men. It would be safer for him to keep out of public view until the mass hysteria dies down. Or he should seek asylum in some free country.</comment>

<comment>This post should also come under act of Sedition. I find it too much provocative. HE IS A MUSLIM that's why he is being targeted. Firstpost money indeed matters for your bed romps, but don't DON'T(for God's sake) try to stoke communal tension. Who funds you BRITONS.  Simply shocked</comment>

<comment>Muslims atheist is an oxymoron moron author. Well almost, except for tarek fateh or salman rushdie no one is openly atheist.</comment>

<comment>very humoruous; more such pieces please...he said he believes in constitution; does this quy plan to hide forever? Has Kanhayyaa been lynced? So, he does not mind if others are lynched...so long as he is fine...ha ha ha..</comment>

<comment>If police did not give protection to Kanhaiya Kumar, knowing fully well that he did not utter anti-national slogans, do you think they would have given any protection to Umar. They would allow the mob to lynch him, as the police is very much hand in glove with the party and government in power, which are creating mass hysteria in name of nationalism.</comment>

<comment>who started it moron. Now the game has turned on them, they are running like babies.</comment>

<comment>No, they are boldly facing the goons and showing that they can take on the combined power of the party, government, police and the media.... One who is running away is your Bassi, Arnab and the likes</comment>

<comment>This man does not deserve to live in India. India ki Barbaadi/Tukade / Go Back India? Chu tiya ho gaya hai ..BC..India ka khaaya, India ka peeya, aur India ki barbaadi chahta hai..we should not be wasting so much of time and attention on him..he needs to be sent to neighboring nation which will be ready to happily embrace him...worthless piece of s#it</comment>

<comment>Do you deserve to stay in India? Tell us what all great things you have done to the country so far.</comment>

<comment>did he or knhayya raise those slogans?</comment>

<comment>LOL. all the call records and location details of this so called innocent is all over media. dont try to defend the indefensible</comment>

<comment>What sort of morons and idiots u guys r turning into day by day... I thought atleast u guys were genuine . what's that head line " the man THEY are calling" what THEY morons as if u guys dnt know he organized the rally he is most wanted Now. Ur the main culprits of India instead of showing genuine details n try solving problems u guys always with ur hate filled mindset against bjp n modi go so down DAT u guys go against Our own country. THE issue is about who organized n participated in such rally drag dem out...that is wat need n nt dragging of ur food bjp r modi into is point is wat nt required . Get some life guys before u mess this country like this bcos of ur hatredness to one party n one man called modi...which even made u to go against ur own country r ur religion u follow too</comment>

<comment>How  desperate can you be,firstpost? The clarifications which you gave still could not explain why he shouted bharat ki barbadi.</comment>

<comment>He didn't shout bharat ki barbadi. There is no proof against him.</comment>

<comment>So Umar is not a terrorist, Afzal was not a terrorist, Ishrat was not a terrorist....only the common man of India is a terrorist.</comment>

<comment>Next Article: Who is hafiz sayeed? conclusion : he is innocent.  of whatever you accuse him of.</comment>

<comment>I know....when I read fp now a days, I feel like I am opening a pak news site</comment>

<comment>There are three characters in this article,  the first is a veteran rabid selfoathing inbred mawali with a fake arabic name, an ex-SIMI agent - the father. Second one is the son, an  equally rabid, utterly cunning/unscrupulous jehadi  masquerading conveniently as a bloodthirsty Maoist (but not Islamist!) again with a fake Arabic name - with self proclaimed grand diabolical delusions of "destroying India" operating unabashedly in thought, words and deeds. The third is the apologist riding his own taqqiya mule in the author of this article, again with a fake arabic name-another rabid sectarian stooge of jehadi cabal, brazenly hypocritical, a shameless liar and fabricator trying to hoodwink the readers in believing that the right to freedom to do what ever these immoral bloodthristy rabidly communal ungrateful parasites want is sacrosanct and onus to provide them that liberty is on very same people that they aim and endeavour to destroy!!!!The strange bedfellows of Islamist-(regressive) Leftist nexus is being exposed world wide each passing day. And they have already become the officially designated pariahs globally, the scums of humanity in 21st century.Any body foolish enough to assume that an active jehadi or an active maoist, their sympathisers, stooges and other 'useful idiots' have any concern for freedom (!) have either their head stuck somehwere unmentionable or are just too pathetic for words. These global pariahs and scums of humanity are the gravest threat to humanity and civilisation itself. Period.Here the author of the article is making a gross and pedestrian yet sincere effort at  operating in 'bad faith' - something both these two cabals are most notorious for apart from, of course, their legendary bloodlust and appetite for unparraled opression of both the idividual and the collective over the centuries since their very inception itself. </comment>

<comment>Someone file a habeous carpus in hc/sc. I think he is in illegal custody.</comment>

<comment>What a bunch of lies. Never heard of an "atheist" and "extreme leftist" shout "insha allah" "insha allah". An atheist muzzie is a dead muzzie since the mullahs will declare such a person an apostate and pass fatwa.</comment>

<comment>He was and is what you call an Abrahamic Monotheistic cultural conditioned freethinker, Their cultural conditioning makes them hate anything non Abrahamic, Hindu. Not a true freethinker in any real sense of the term !</comment>

<comment>All those who blame RSS for everything a chappalslap each on their cheecks.  Cheeki charges they throw on RSS, for they have no knowledge what RSS does; those pseudo secularists indulge in anti hinduism;intend votebank politicsto achieve power in the name of democracy Pseudo revolutionaries masquerading as leftists Profess class wars and kill thousands, for they believe power comes through barrels of a gun; Those who killed Rohith are  our Yechuris and RajasThey are about to commit yet another murder in Umar While Rohith's killing intended to revolutionize Dalit,Intent on Umar is radicalise muslims.Overall objective; Achieve power through radicalism For Indians do not let power to those who hold guns in the hands</comment>

<comment>N a video of Rohit vemula few days before his suicide was leaked and got circulated in social media. Non of this national media idiots n morons showed that video except south media. In the video Rohit was seen talking against Hindus givings his hatred the oughts against Hindus wen he was questioned abt y he torn a abvp banner. One of the abvp member in video tells  a Dalit too n Hindu too n am in abvp wats ur prob?. N Rohit iscseen telling he vil tear anything which is saffron color. Thus was his level of hatredness towards Hindus bcos he himself made such victimized mindset. N his grandmother father n family members agreed he was nt dalit. Its a rage in AP/ TELANGANA ppl who convert to Christianity either continue der caste r tale SC certificate. So Rohit was a converted christian n took SC status after converting.Every politician n all the PPl in Ap/ telangana knew who he was wat was his mentality his conversion thing etc etc....BT this MORONS of national media NEVER tried to show that video vid dubbed translation at least n nebe cshowed facts. </comment>

<comment>Aur aaya naya jhumlebaaz...even those who don't know telugu can clearly hear that he expressed his hatred against the ABVP and HINDUTVA and the RSS...now I know many of your kind get wet dreams thinking that RSS, hindutva, ABVP and hinduism is one and the same...sorry to dispel the myth but they are not</comment>

<comment>if you have it why dont you put it on youtube ?  anyways, his was a murder by the left and mulla gang to gain political benefits. he was murdered and hung prior to which he was forced to write a suicide note too.</comment>

<comment>Sorry to say but I do know what the RSS does (at least from what I have seen)...my aunt and her family are part of the RSS in their home town...for them (i.e the RSS) the ideal Bharat was the conditions before 1000 A.D....they believe muslims (all non-hindus) in India are second class citizens...they believe India had been under foreign rule not for 200 years of Britain...but 900 years under muslims...majority of them are brahmins....they don't believe in mixing of 'castes'..and frown upon even when you are friends with someone of a different caste (say a lingayat) let alone marry someone...they don't believe that girls have a right to live their lives as they wish...and all the patriotism that they show...it is for Bharat and not India...they have a clear distinction in that...hell even their chief Mohan Bhagwat has made a distinction...ohh and btw...in case of rohit..your yechuris and rajas did not dash a letter to irani..it was the ABVP which is not associated with the left in any form whatsoever</comment>

<comment>KAMAT,  don't you have a name? Certainly KAMAT is not your name but your caste.  You, perhaps in your below 40s, having been had an opportunity to take birth in post independent India still did not grow up with the required reformative changes to suit with the changing times.  You cannot blame your uncle and aunt when you yourself are one such.  Pehaps you have an axe to grind with them due to some family feud.I appreciate that you admitted that you do not know what the RSS does.  It is an admission and that bails you from your imaginary accusations.  If you do not know about RSS how could you accuse them of anything.  Your ignorance disqualifies your accusations and makes it really irrelevant.If you think RSS is anti muslim, then you must know that working for the upliftment of Hindus is not anti-muslim or anti-non Hindus.  This is a political slogan coined by Nehru from independent days since he knew that he could be the PM only by dividing Hindus for there were many more capable and intelligent leaders than Nehru.  So he divided the Hindus into upper caste and lower caste, pitting one against the other and according a life time reservation for lower castes so that they are made aware of their standing in the society even when they grow up the ladders in society both economically and socially.  This was the curse of India to remind someone that he is a lower caste and cannot equate with upper caste.  Congress were topped by upper castes and used the lower castes continually as a vote bank.  they kept a few lower caste faces in their cabinet so that the vote bank remained with them.  This is the greatest political strategy played by any politician on any country.As for Rohit, he was killed and hung by his own organisations, both left and fanatic anti indian mulla parties, for political gains.  Objective is clear to continue with the Dalit/Upper caste divide in the Hindus.  Now at JNU one should not be surprised if the guy of DSU disappeared for good from the planet - it will be another murder to blame BJP and RSS as anti muslims.Man you must grow up learning all that is relevant to the subject on which you wish to comment.till then shut up and stand upping your bum on your fours.</comment>

<comment>Arrey bhai...zara bahar jao..apna desh dekho...use jaano...kitne tahra tahra ke naam hai apne deshvasi ke voh jaano...bus baith gaye pc ke saamne chup bina samjhe kuch bhi type karte hue...you know there is a part of India known as south India...where there are these kinds of names exist...at least I used a part of my name...you don't even have the balls to that. Toh ab tum antaryami bhi ho...pc ke saamne baith kar patha chala family fued hai? Bacche agar family fued hota toh baat nahi karta...aur kya kya kaand sikhate hai RSS mein voh pata nahi chalta...There is a difference between 'anti muslim' and 'pro hindu'. They do not work for the upliftment of hinduism..they work to propagate a form of hinduism that they believe is the right one. And rather than calling others ignorant, please try and enlighten yourself about what the RSS' viewpoint is regarding muslims and christians...voh toh karte nahi..bas dimagh mein kya aata hai vohi sach maante ho...please do read about what the RSS founder KB Hedgewar and his chela Golwalker wrote...and rather than asking me to 'learn'...I would advise you to start knowing more about this organization which you claim is working for the upliftment of hindus and is rashtrawadi....but that can be only done once you lift your head away from Bhagwat and Modi's lap (if you get my meaning)</comment>

<comment>Do not bring your family feud to sermon the society.You have a problem with your uncle and aunt, confront them.As for RSS you made an admission you know nothing about them.  That is your ignorance.  The criticism that you make is based on your half cooked knowledge handed out to you from the psychopantriac slaves of Congress.  Go to them and learn more about them to criticize.  When you do not know anything, you have no right to be a critic.A proud Indian is any time better than a castiest title like Kamat.  So that story end here.You make it look like the others type on their PC and you just talk to your putter to print the letters.If anyone working for Hinduism is to be considered anti-non-hindu, let it it be so.  Who cares!  It is a fashion for some pseudo educated pseudo secularists to bash hindu until now.  This will be resisted and confronted henceforth.</comment>

<comment>UPA Government Had Put DSU on Watch List for 'Harbouring Naxalites'By Express News ServicePublished: 19th February 2016NEW DELHI: Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, who rushed to the support of JNU students, may not be aware that the UPA government led by his party had placed the Democratic Students’ Union under the watch list, terming it a front that provides safe havens for Naxalites and mentors new cadres. DSU is alleged to have organi¬sed the ‘anti-India’ event on February 9 at JNU.In what could be embarrassing for the Congress, the UPA government had told Parliament about DSU in 2014, saying such front organisations were mentoring ‘professional revolutionaries’ to be inducted into underground movements. On February 18, 2014, MoS Home Affairs RPN Singh told Parliament that DSU and other front organisations were shifting to urban areas looking for safe hideouts.“On occasion, during operations by security forces, the CPI (Maoist) underground cadres shift to softer areas including urban areas looking for safe hideouts. On such occasions, the over-ground front organisations provide safe hideouts to armed cadres,” Singh had said in response to a question in Lok Sabha. In the Home Ministry’s list of active CPI Maoists front organisations, DSU is mentioned as ‘active in Bihar, Delhi and Jharkhand’. RPN Singh also told Parliament that activities of the CPI (Maoist) and its front organisations were being closely monitored.In an earlier response in 2011, the UPA had told Parliament that front organisations were being monitored. “The front organisations facilitate procurement of supplies to Maoist war machinery and initiate legal action on various issues to slow down the enforcement regime. They are also adept at dissemination of propaganda and disinformation to demonise the state and security forces.”</comment>

<comment>The graph of who slept with whom at JNU is a very complex Any-Any web. Hence they will all talk nice about each other and hide the truth</comment>

<comment>Umar Khalid is being targeted only because of his religion. He has become an easy target of the ABVP and Sanghi goons.</comment>

<comment>Pak me hi kyun n rah gaye? Ab tak allah ke bande hohi jate.</comment>

<comment>Kanaiya is Hindu. So if a non-Muslim, non-Dalit, probably a specific caste was targeted, so called seculars would have had peace?? What the hell are you upto? Just like you guys say terrorism has no religion, anti-nationalism has no religion!</comment>

<comment>no he is a target because his views have been anti india.. why would country care about a muzzie otherwise, there are millions of them</comment>

<comment>Umar Khalid is not being targeted because he is a MUSLIM. The way he was shouting anti- India slogans is his identity. That he fears for his life and that he is in hiding goes to show the extent of his guilt. If I go to Saudi Arabia and start shouting anti Saudi slogans who will spare me.They will stone me to death there, no trials required. Certain things are not done, even in a democracy.</comment>

<comment>This presstitude is proving the innocense of the ultra anti national and a traitor with added weight od venom from his father who is proven SIMI activist. I wonder who paid for this article. I appeal, wish and hope the Intelligence agencies should look towards such presstitudes and their source of bank accounts.</comment>

<comment>This article is a crap.Who will believe all this?</comment>

<comment>I look at these comments and sometimes feel the bhakt money will be better served doing something constructive rather than hiring internet trolls for slandering people with view points other than their own. Just a little well known fact for you guys, the views of Umar Khaild on the Kashmir Issue is the same as that of PDP's Mehbooba Mufti. The BJP is trying to appease them there and trying to form a democratic coalition with them. So please please check your facts before slandering people and to all the people who feel Hindus are being oppressed , please open your eyes, the whole nation is looking at you. Please behave.</comment>

<comment>I think both the BJP and the PDP are answerable to people of Jammu and Kashmir for governance and for doing things for the people who elected them</comment>

<comment>I am not a bhakt and nor a troll. I don't get money from anyone for writing my view point. I am a regular guy. But Umar Khalid cannot be allowed to carry on with such anti- national activities. Nor can JNU . Freeedom of speech doesn't suggest you can say unpalatable things about the nation.</comment>

<comment>If BJP was trying to appease PDP, they should have let this whole episode of "Kashmir Ki Azadi" die down, right?</comment>

<comment>true...the BJP is destructive-minded. Engage in verbal debate, why always violent?</comment>

<comment>How many instances of this? Those who are party to it be punished, BJP or non BJP.Verbal debate and treachery was responsible for converting 90% or more Sindhis to Islam and the rest losing their land. Of course Bharat is their land too.</comment>

<comment>Wish Congress and rest of opposition engaged in verbal debate in Parliament! Please give your advice to left n Congress :)</comment>

<comment>The difference is that people inside Kashmir have ambivalent ideas of nationhood, what is the definition of India, and people of India are reconciled to the fact that the understanding process within Kashmir is slow and painful. Even bringing these folks into the democratic framework was a 10 year journey..</comment>

<comment>Most of the separatists live in Delhi, live in plush lifestyle, speak good English and run their political business of separatism.</comment>

<comment>It does not matter whether he is a muslim/christian/hindu/buddhist monk/ any of hundreds of castes/ any of three genders/ vegetarian/eats any animal/ communists/ capitalist.   Main issue is whether is participated in the event to glorify convicted terrorists and shouted slogans for splitting the nation.  If he did let him face the courts.  If he did not he has nothing to worry.  Media and politicians should not be the judge.</comment>

<comment>omar Khalids father was SIMI leader ... Kanhaiyas parents were leftist membersSab Khandani SICKULAR hain</comment>

<comment>yes omar khalid is innocent.....................the same way AFZAL, YAKUB, KASAB, OSAMA was innocent..as they are Muslim, so they are innocent..............they have fundamental right to do RIOTS and KILLING..but Hindus are not allowed to do even self defence...</comment>

<comment>his dad was SIMI leader............which involved in a lot of terror activities</comment>

<comment>pls dont be pro terrorist............leftist becomes NAXALS......muslim extremist becomes terrorist....and kill peoplesbut hindu becomes rss member.......and serves the nation and its people</comment>

<comment>is this journalism of fiction writing @ worst?this khalid was shouting on zee news that  court cant decide who is terrorist!he doesnt trust the supreme court of India & he is law abiding citizen???wah re sicklurs! have some shame!</comment>

<comment>This traitor's dad was an Ex SIMI, a fact hidden by the author</comment>

<comment>SAMEER YASIR: It is exactly people like you that are ANTI-NATIONAL, simply because you support the cause of separatists, anarchists and those who want India " broken into 1000 pieces". People like you are either sold to the ideology of destroying India, or you are on the payroll of those elements who want India destroyed. YOU CAN DO YOUR BEST TO CONVINCE INDIANS THAT UMAR KHALID IS SNOW WHITE BUT NO ONE WILL BELIEVE THE TRASH YOU HAVE CHURNED OUT.One last question: NOT ONLY IS THIS TRAITOR  GUILTY BUT ALSO A  COWARD, OR ELSE, WHY HIDE LIKE A WIMP?</comment>

<comment>And this extreme left secularist wants kashmir to be separated from India purely on religion. Also for this extreme left democrat, afzal guru who attacked Indian parliament is a hero.</comment>

<comment>Mr. Truth Revealer..... I truly wonder the extent of your knowledge and understanding. So beautifully written and eloquent. With more people writing like this, I see a beautiful and fascist future state. Many will believe in what you say and post it in Facebook. India from being mostly illiterate has become a country of mostly Illiterates who can write and read.</comment>

<comment>Ultimately this crooked media will make all of them as innocent </comment>

<comment>Now malicious attempt to make him a messiah. If he's true atheist why he was seen raising Islamic slogansSecondly I want to know whether he did oppose the surgery on him or not by qazi</comment>

<comment>These Jnu students are not being questioned for having an ajenda on kashmir.. Kashmiris have that freedom. As do all indians..we have freedom of expression on many issues..  Its when they declare war on india to achieve thier idea   of india... When they threaten the law of the land.... Things become questionable.. if people threaten  to burn your house down do you not want them to be arrested  and questioned at the very least</comment>

<comment>The author's version is suspect - he calls that anti-national guy an atheist (communist), but going by his looks with a typically prominent beard, indicates something else !!and fleeing from the scene (he must be hiding somewhere in the JNU hostels), reveals all !! their only aim was to grow up to some opportunist politicians in the JDU or CONgress!!</comment>

<comment>Sorry my dear - let us not convert this into a religious discussion. This is EXACTLY what these anti-national wants, so that it can become complex, Very simple- If you hate India, you have NO place in India, PERIOD.</comment>

<comment>The issue is very simple. The entire episode was organised in the backdrop of the death anniversary of Afzal Guru a confirmed terrorist executed after due process of law and death sentence awarded by the Highest Court. The law had taken its own due course and ultimately stopped at his execution. Questioning the decision and shouting anti India slogans and shouting slogans to the effect that Afzal Guru will be born in each house is nothing but antinational. At the least it is contempt of court and ridicule of highest offices like  President who declined the mercy petition. Whoever was involved or whoever was present as a silent spectator is responsible. If  Dushsasan and Duryodan are charged with active complicity, then Bhisma, Drona and Krupa were equally culpable with silent abetment. If Umer Khalid is free to raise slogans then he is also responsible to answer the law of the land. There is no freedom of speech which is carried out with a purpose to destroy the motherland.</comment>

<comment>There is a big gap between what people think is "Freedom of speech" is and what it really is.. There is a big gap between political opposition, and sedition also.Freedom of speech is the liberty to hold any opinion on anything, without getting caught and punished for it. Freedom of speech is the liberty to speak on any issues.. But then, like all good things, it comes with a set of riders. If I hold a "Criminal" opinion, I am at liberty to hold it, but not spread it. I may say that "Euthanasia" is good. But that doesnt mean, I start a "Euthanasia India Foundation", and call up doctors, encouraging them to euthanize. This is where the freedom of speech ends.. The moment, I want to spread my opinion to others, freedom of speech ends, and "Propaganda" begins.This propaganda is also OK, as long as it not against the countries founding spirit, law and its generally accepted positions in politics, and it does not violate any law.  So, if I want to send a message of seceding Kashmir from India, that is against the position held by the Constitution of India, then I run the risk of going to the terrain of "Anti-nationalist".Political opposition, is the act of opposing a law or a rule, and opposition to a rule is by itself OK, So, if you want more autonomy for Kashmir, say it so. Say that Kashmir must get greater autonomy, and the following rules need change.. It becomes sedition, when the whole act is premeditated, propagandist, methodical..So, the problem is that the rule tends to be difficult to conclude. You call it opinion.. and then it drifts into propaganda. You call it Politics... it drifts into Anti-nationalism.. You call it 'Freedom of speech'.. and then it drifts into Sedition 'So, in a sense, the interpretation of what is civil, and what is criminal is getting thinner by the day.. So, this is where "National pride" comes into play. When the interpretation of tall words becomes so curiously thin, and it can degenerate into a war of words.. but when we say that people living this country, and enjoying its subsidies and soil, can indulge in "National pride".Now armed with that pride, you can choose to say something, or defend something, do something or choose not to do it.. Its easier to decide , instead of indulging in a constitutional word soup.</comment>

<comment>I live in the US (have been here for 16 years), so am qualified to speak. The second amendment gives every person on US soil the freedom of speech and expression.However No one, even Islamists would ever hold a "cultural event" like the one in JNU, to make a hero of those who bombed the twin towers. That is being anti-national, that is NOT FREEDOM OF SPEECH (Sorry I am yelling because you dudes want to hide under "political correctness" and defend anti-national elements).</comment>

<comment>Dead on bolt, right !!</comment>

<comment>Sorry it should be the "1st amendment" not the 2nd.</comment>

<comment>are you telling your opinion on freedom of speech and sedition or what is enshrined in the constitution ? is this based on some court judgement. If so link to it ?There are substantive differences between say freedom of speech in US, in India, in UK etc.</comment>

<comment>US cannot be compared to India.. for many reasons.US Constitution first of all does not provide different set of rights to different sets of people. So, you don't have Autonomy for Kashmiris, and some other tighter rules for Telugu people or Gujaratis. You have "Muslim Personal Law" for Muslims, and a set of prewritten rules on marriage and divorce for Hindus..So, in that context, you cannot pick and choose.. Constitution is not a ala carte food menu.. Where you take Chinese Sabji, Thai rice, and American noodles, and eat it..  You want the freedom of speech from US, then you should also sign up for uniform civil rights and civil law like US.People want Freedom of speech from US, Differential rights system from India, Criminal code from Ghana, Labor rights from France, Free health care from Canada, Sexual permissiveness from Netherlands, Tax laws of Ireland...That is not done.!!</comment>

<comment>Free speech from US in India, that is a different matter. I just asked, whether what you said were your opinions or what is based in Indian constitution.</comment>

<comment>It is my opinion, based on what I am seeing on media..My summary point is that, the only way we will be able to get beyond this analysis -paralysis, is to apply a concept of national pride, and let the rest of the semantics settle down a bit.</comment>

<comment>ok thanks for the clarification.</comment>

<comment>Ultimately truth prevails F.Post , The villains are portrayed as Heroes  ..Shame on you paid media for taking side of anti-nationals in the grab of freedom of speech .  I am afraid if this keeps going on and the the patience of 14 lacs armymen run thin who are laying down their lives for the sake of motherland , will teach you all , so called intellectuals , a lesson you will never forget . enough is enough we can see that anti nationals activities is going on and you try to justify it ..</comment>

<comment>I feel sad for the guy but he should surrender immediately and face the law. From the past verdicts of the supreme court, it is quite clear that the case of sedition against him is weak. He should just render some apology to those who feel hurt because of the slogans on barbadi,war etc. The media should also issue clarifications that he is not a 'terrorist/maoist' etc to lower the temperature of this situation. As a fellow atheist i know that we are mostly non-conformist and question everything but sometimes there are lines and war against state is one such line.</comment>

<comment>If he is not Kashmiri, it is even more worrisome. It kind of gives a push to radical Hidutva people that, a Muslim cannot be a good Indian.He would also be a pain to Kashmiri students, who are struggling to settle with might India. (I could see that feel from National Front guy in Arnab's debate). He neither endorsed the cultural event, nor supported Bharat Ki Barbaadi. But he said the fact. Kashmiri people view Afzhal Guru with sympathy. No need to pounce on him for that. He has been from Kashmir, where armed force reside. Lot of people had the same sympathy for Indira Gandhi and Rajeev Gandhi killers. All these sympathisers are not wishing for Bharat Ki Barbaadi. From Indian Government point of view, probably it was helpless in that case. He Afzhal was in jail for uncertain time, he could have been a time bomb. (Terrorists capturing someone and demanding Afzhal to be freed). One can talk to that group (Kashmiri) with empathy. But people like Khalid are the roadblock to such dialogues. The Kashmiri boys will be unfortunately branded along with Khalid. Basically this boy is bringing troubles to both the groups, Kashmiri and non Kashmiri Muslims. </comment>

<comment>aaj se mein bhi aethist or commnist hoon ok ? Chalo ab its ok for me to start building Ram Mandir</comment>

<comment>so basically he is a "good boy" because his father said so, sirf naare hi to laga raha tha, desh ko todo do, hindustan ko mita do etc etc. bichara.. media ne le liho gi uski... dant bhi toot rahe hain, bada bhi to sochna hain.. passprt tak nahi hain.. pakisatn wale to bilkul invite nahi karenge without paasport... yaasir miyaan saare musalkatte ek hi ranga mein range hian is country mein... chahe kuch ho jaaye.. kate kate bhai bhai</comment>

<comment>What slogans? Kanahiya and he never said anything bad about the country. He said in his slogans that he wanted freedom from poverty, freedom for communal blood-shed, freedom from social disparity. He never even once raised any anti-India slogan. Media mixed up three video for TRP. Check actual videos of all three and in fact not a single slogan raised by him.</comment>

<comment>How do you get freedom from poverty, communal blood shed and social disparity? By preaching violence? What a philosophy!</comment>

<comment>It is not clear whether  he is being questioned  for raising  slogan on his own.. Or for organising a meeting where the slogans were certainly  raised by other students... </comment>

<comment>first I read Complete article and then I saw the reader....now clinic all clear..</comment>

<comment>Not a single word on the slogans???? Look you will have to face the consequences (under the law of land ), these kind of PR will not help Mr. Yasir. You people have taken everything granted on the name of freedom of speech. Why you always selective in reporting anything. If you hate present govt. than say so, but do not hide behind.</comment>

<comment>Comrade, yahan bat miya bhai ki chal rahi hai, Bhumihar ki nahi.</comment>

<comment>it is immaterial whether you are Hindu, Muslim or any other religion. Nation is and must always be first. Sacrifice for nation is supreme sacrifice. How can activities to break India or think of its Barbadi ,can be allowed at JNU or any other campus or any part of the country is beyond the imagination of a right thinking Indian. Unfortunately there are students and teachers too, who shamelessly advocate such an ideology in the garb of free speech. Some of the media houses , print media and senior journalist promote such people whom a common person calls - Anti national (Because they think bad of the mother land which provided them food , shelter and every thing ) for some ulterior motives.I have noticed that medical students and engineering student never indulge in such activities. How some student are engaged in anti national activities and find time to form human chain o support people who chant slogans to break this country, may be because these students are not kept engaged. Empty mind is devil's work shop.Umar Khalid should come out of the hole he is hiding in like a rat and face the court and apologise to the nation.</comment>

<comment>"Apologize"? No, he should do some jail time, carry a criminal record and wait for 7 years for a pardon. If we had a system like that, folks would think twice before going on national television and defend your slogan mongering and working against the very nation that feeds you, clothes you. pays you for the subsidized education, and makes hero out of a zero guy like you.</comment>

<comment>Why he running like a rat?? He sure is behaving like a Kashmiri!!!</comment>

<comment>When media and Justice Arnab have declared him the enemy of the nation and the partisan behaviour of cops it would be stupid if he comes out</comment>

<comment>its not stupid....its cowardly and criminal....in short...its Being Muslim....lol...</comment>

<comment>you hate muslims ?</comment>

<comment>I hate anti-nationals!!! You like anti-nationals??</comment>

<comment>your statement was specifically with respect to muslims.</comment>

<comment>No its with respect to Umar Khalid....it seems you don't understand English properly...is that why u didn't answer my question regarding 'your love for anti-nationals'?</comment>

<comment>being muslim is being cowardly and criminal is what you believe ? don't run away from what you feel. You are stereotyping them ?Why should I love those anti-nationals ? but yes I will admit that I was not offended by those statements. Statements do not offend me.If anything I have something like pity for those stupid students who shouted anti-Indian slogans, wasting their precious life and getting the Indian state after them.</comment>

<comment>A new theory has to be built up to explain why some Indians still stick to communism/socialism when the system has been SHOWN to produce hyperinflation genocide and single party slavery. Let us take the help of Freud-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------What if some Indians want to screww mother and Indians want to screww motherland?? Is this the reason why Indian men have difficulty in have girl friends and India does not want to get involved in wars outside India, and is deeply INWARD looking?Sigmund Freud father of psychoanalysis said "mother worship" when asked to define India. Continuing this analysis::Arnab Goswami goes slightly wrong when he says even left loves India. Love non-mediated by religion turns motherly love to love for female. That is why Left is intent of screwwing India. That love is sexual love for mother, motherland. Jats and Kapus in Andhra Pradesh[who have burnt a train] are demanding reservation. That is again immoral sexual love for motherland.Such effect of predatory sexual love for motherland [nothing wrong with motherly love]has even led to murder of motherland in history as following shows..Dahir was BRAHMIN King in Sindh. By enlisting the support of local tribes (such as the Jats, Meds and Bhuttos) and Buddhist rulers of Nerun, Bajhra, Kaka Kolak and Siwistan as infantry to his predominantly-mounted army, Muhammad bin Qasim defeated Dahir and captured his eastern territories for the Umayyad Caliphate.Dahir then tried to prevent Qasim from crossing the Indus River, moving his forces to its eastern banks. Eventually, however, Qasim crossed and defeated forces at Jitor led by Jaisiah (Dahir's son). Qasim fought Dahir at Raor (near modern Nawabshah) in 712, killing him; Dahir's wife immolated herself (with other women in her household) in accordance with the Hindu tradition of Jauhar.=========================================================Academicians have swallowed a fascist lie spread by media that India is a democracy.What a Joke! What about the assault on Individual right of merit by reservation policy? In which country are cities brought to a halt by bandhs? Media should first say India was a Ocholocracy[mob rule].India is a Ocholocracy[mob rule] not a democracy. Free speech can be explosive unless it is a part of movement to uproot the Ocholocracy. In a Ocholocracy INDIVIDUAL rights are murdered by definition with help of state. Examples of murder of INDIVIDUAL right are reservation policy which is murder of merit, an INDIVIDUAL right and socialism(by definition legal robbery) which is murder property right, another INDIVIDUAL right.Why are Indians not trusted with free gun laws as in USA? Answer to this simple question demolishes free speech argument.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why were leftists associated with secessionists? The culture of socialist legal robbery is manifesting itself as secessionism - because the socialists may have realized it is impossible to come to an understanding on who the supreme dictator should be and they want to establish numerous single part dictatorships over fragments of country. Socialism has to lead to single party dictatorships over fragments of country.Adam Smith, the father of economics, says in economics Man Proposes and God Disposes. If every body in a nation become do-gooders -- God disposes -- and we will have hell on earth. if man proposes to be selfish -- God again disposes -- and we will have prosperity and peace.Giving rational explanation of God, the elder do-gooders , MK Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Ambedkar etc forgot that a strong socialist state is required to do good. And it will demand its pound of flesh closest to the heart – rampant corruption. A strong state emerges in an environment of shortages – to distribute scant resources. Any socialist state will NOT destroy the reason for its existence. 24 hour water supply will reduce water required to be released by 30%. No Government Engineer in India will accept this. Scarcity, distress is required for the reason for its existence. If no scarcity exists it will manufacture it. Mysore had water scarcity even though it had KRS dam beside it. It is a question of power. A society can either have equality or freedom but never both. Why? To enforce equality a strong and intrusive state is required. Stateism is against Individualism and kills freedom.Since 1947, the political parties, government need not care as they have attained emancipation from democracy -- principally by the tool of reservation policy, where vote banks are formed. And they will vote according to predictable patterns whatever the rulers do or don't do. In other words India has become a Fascist state[socialism is a necessary component of it --Nazi means National Socialist]by the vehicle of reservation policy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just voting does not make India democracy. Protection of rights of the smallest minority the INDIVIDUAL MAKES A SYSTEM DEMOCRATIC. The problem is, India is an Ocholocracy[mob rule] where Individual rights are murdered[example is murder of merit an Individual right by reservation policy and property rights by socialism. Socialism is legal robbery.A period of good dictatorship may be required to cure Indians of disease of bad democracy, due to the infection of socialism or legal robbery. Otherwise bad democracy can kill in millions like in Cambodia under Pol Pot. Ocholocracy looks like democracy but it is not. Just look at immorality of Indians- Laloo the reason for largest migration of Biharis from Bihar was reelected.-----------------------------------------------------------It is logically wrong to allow communist parties to function in a multi party democracy as they are for single party dictatorship - they openly state it! Ban communist parties===================================================Now BJP/RSS should bring :1)free gun laws+capitalism so that vote bank politics becomes impossible; Free gun law CAN BE VERY POPULAR AS REPUBLICANS OF USA WILL TELL. Tribals dont care much for car, refrigerator - they care for guns. Popular measures like this are required as BJP has to win elections countering vote bank politics2)capitalism to increase size of cake.

<comment>You must be the first person who has accused Sameer Yasir of being an author ! He is a bigot and a certified prest*tute, who habitually spews secessionistic venom !</comment>

<comment>It says that his views on Kashmir are well documented and known.. He is opposed to control of Kashmir</comment>

<comment>Khalids father was SIMI... Kanhaiyas parents were CPI members (or some other commie party)Sab Khandani secular hain... thats why they will eventually join the other Khandani Secular... RaGa</comment>

<comment>Coward.  Runs away and hides. Why doesn't he come out and face his detractors and the police and fight his case? He fears he would be lynched? Then, his ideological posturing is just that.</comment>

<comment>Umar Khalid was atheist:..He pasted nude photos of Hindu gods and goddess in many spots in the campusHe did not come out in support of Mohammad's cartoon in Franch or Kamlesh Tiwari.Wonder which variety of Atheist he was.He thought about poor first as the first post conversation suggests:-He had a solution-Hand over Kashmir to Pakistan and break india into thousand pieces...</comment>

<comment>He was and is what you call an Abrahamic Monotheistic cultural conditioned freethinker, Their cultural conditioning makes them hate anything non Abrahamic, Hindu. Not a true freethinker in any real sense of the term.</comment>

<comment>Just see the article based on hypothetical assumption :1. Father was an Islamic terrorist, son is an atheist who only hates Hinduism 2. An imaginary friend that too a girl with name supriya 3. The man who said on zeenews "who are judge to decide if afzal was a terrorist"   is now a constitutional abiding cirizen 4. Finally, just see the WhatsApp message, the man who wants india to break in 1000 pieces is now thinking of  hunger if Indians..Muzzies can never be trusted. </comment>
