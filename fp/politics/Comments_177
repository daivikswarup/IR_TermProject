<comment>We agree with Terroiststan PM. India has no better bargaining power to stop border problems and terrorism also do have courage to stop biryani diplomacy with the terrorist country also. Full marks to Pakistan.</comment>

<comment>Give up Kashmir, nuclear weapons, stop funding terrorist training camps and in turn we will offer you lots of praise at the UN. There, bilateral relations hogaya </comment>

<comment>Really? Does anybody believe you? Including that man in the mirror? Your ancestors stabbed us in the back and you want us to trust you? Do you even know what "TRUST" means?</comment>

<comment>My azz! Glad you are chocking..</comment>

<comment>Pakistan wants better bilateral relations by training jihadis, exporting terrorists and counterfeiting Indian currency - enough of this bullsh√¨t. India is finally talking the right steps towards Pakistan. We should suspend all bilateral relations with the Pakis until they stop their anti-Indian policy completely.</comment>

<comment>hand over dawood and hafiz sayed !!!! then india will improve relations with Pak !!!</comment>

<comment>+ kill all terrorists.</comment>

<comment>yes kill entire Jud, Let and ISI too !!!</comment>

<comment>All Taxi Drivers, Janitors, Waiters etc. are buzzing after meeting Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif during his session with Pakistani diaspora</comment>

<comment>Nawaz Bhai ko lagta hai bijli aur khana mil gaya hai US jaake, pakistan main ye sab luxuries kahan</comment>

<comment>O taajdar-e-dozhak, jannat nasseb na hoga kaafiron ko, ab bhi waqt hai, sambahl ja warna jaam khaali hi rah jayega...</comment>

<comment>Yeah, like N_azis wanted better relations with Czechoslovakia, Poland, France and UK -- Nawuss parroting his bosses' way-stale line!</comment>

<comment>Bhai Aisa heading daloge to Public comment section me aandhi macha degi..</comment>

<comment>We are tired of this routine.  Terrorists attacks and then talk of better ties, the cycle continues.  We don't want any ties with Pakistan, they have nothing to offer to us.  Indian government should declare Pakistan a enemy state and avenge the loss of life because of terrorist attacks sponsored by Pakistan.</comment>

<comment>So Nawaz also interacts with his "diaspora" on his foreign tours... So he is not much different from our local "hawabaaz"..</comment>
