<comment>this grand alliance in itself is a big fraud and hoax theory, just wana grab power but will fail............nitish is just doing caste politics these days, bjp removed domination of certein caste in harya will do same in bihar jai modi jai strong india...........vote fr bjp if u love ur country more than caste</comment>

<comment>Perhaps Nomadic forgot to read todays newspapers. It serves as a reminder of how BJP government in Haryana functions.</comment>

<comment>kya karoon bhakt/nomadic, bjp bhi caste politics hi play kar raha he</comment>

<comment>bjp which was a 3rdplayer in bihar making nitish and laloo too get united itself is a victory fr bjp..........rss speech has been tampered with nitish is clearly doing caste politics here,bhagwat termed that every caste with significant prescence is trying to get more benifits out of reservation,..this is maing reservation being misused, anyone with political brains wud accept his remarks,</comment>

<comment>With the lynching and killing of Muslims by RSS elements, with the  incendiary rhetoric statements of Haryana CM, BJP Union Ministers, BJP Law Makers, MPs and MLAs; it is very natural that Muslims have turned away from BJP. Thus BJP becomes deprived from almost one crore Muslim Votes from Bihar.RSS Chief's reminder to BJP to review the current reservation policy has turned away the OBC, EBC, SC and ST from BJP. This way, BJP is now deprived of majority of 65% of Bihar population.With APND Modi making only Jumla, the general mass has turned away from BJP. All the people waited for Rs. 15 Lakhs for one-and-a half year instead they have got daal at Rs. 200 per kg.Biharis, mostly the poor, the deprived, the hand to mouth are furious at Modi for he follows crony capitalism and he has shun the constitutional duty of following the co-operative socialism!Only that class of people who dominated Bihar politics, prior to Mandal, majority of the ex-congressmen, and now have joined BJP in the hope of ruling Bihar again will automatically vote for BJP.  This is the solid 15% vote bank of BJP - all weather ready, ever ready vote bank.Mr. Amit Shah is using every Kautaliya Neeti in Bihar election, sam, dam, dand, vibhed. He recognised that dam works best in Bihar.And I learnt that BJP is distributing among the Bihari electorates  Rs.10, 000 Crores. But this amount may fetch the BJP close to one Crore votes only. Since BJP needs at least 2.5 Crore votes in Bihar, its appropriately right time that BJP increases the amount to be distributed to Rs. 25, 000 Crore before it is too late!</comment>

<comment>BJP's development plank....Hahahahhha.People are looking at the sky rocketing prices of onions and Pulses only</comment>

<comment>for pulses ..............only crop which didnt benifit from green revolution is pulses</comment>

<comment>but no state has benifitted after feku came to power, only false promises</comment>

<comment>u reading paper or wat ??:d</comment>

<comment>yes they have change direction they used to look before, down under</comment>

<comment>Depends who you ask. The BJP has both the right-wing Hindu base, and the right-wing economic base. They tug on both to keep both factions satisfied.</comment>

<comment>The secularism in present form has been biggest fraud in itself. Where are these secularists these days when the supreme court has been harping on the issue of uniform civil code.But for the votebank sake these seculars have never tried to impose one law for all the human beings in this country.</comment>

<comment>The name Hindu was invented by the white invader. The Congress and sekular parties started with the term Hindutva. The British divided the society with Reservation policies using their brainwashed stooges especially Gandhiji and Ambedkar. After independence CONg party used this policy to its votebank. The sekular parties like DMK, TDP, RJD, SP and Left also contributed their share in the plunder. Now the beef politics is dividing the society. The sekular media gives so much importance for some unfortunate incidents created by paid goondas</comment>

<comment>The glory of India started in Bihar. The indus valley civilization is bogus theory by the White Invader.This is the land of Emperor Asoka, Lord Buddha and Nalanda University. The fertile gangetic in Bihar enriched the lives of people. The plunder of Bihar started with the British Opium cultivation and the hoarding of rice grains and burning of evergreen forests. The wrong economic policies created several famines. The destruction of forests caused severe droughts in summer and floods during monsoon. During famine people migrated to other lands in search of jobs. The British and other greedy Indian business families extracted the maximum out of these indentured laborers and labelled them as coolies</comment>

<comment>ya, IVC is fake! then what is not fake? rss-bjp development aka hindutva model</comment>

<comment>IMO, both are past the average Bihari's comprehension!</comment>

<comment>Hindutva means peace, love, stability & progress, BJP development agenda best suits people instead of those offering,caste religion, conflict and anarchy. Voters will vote for development, Bihar cannot remain behind when rest of India runs ahead.</comment>

<comment>neither  care nor  words of NDA are so pure as it pretend for bihar it is just mask to fool people of social ideology in name of development ....what BJP did in last parliamentary election . I crossed barrier of cast and voted for BJP but the action and favours shown for industry shown by this RSS controlled BHART JLAAO PARTY (BJP) ... ...</comment>

<comment>Friend In think you have poor understanding world over investors & industry is favoured because only they can provide employment & pay tax, why Bihar is behind because there is no investors & industry. What do do with caste? Is meager reservation enough for the youth who are looking for good opportunity? Time to ponder</comment>

<comment>we as Bihari are really optionless for  because Mhagathbandhan says it is casteist loudly while NDA talks for development but it deserves casteism inherently..... .... so I opt Mhagathbandhan because at-least it accepts what it is.But really as a Bihari I look forward for a Bihar which must be free from politics from cast, society based on equality, economics based on skill, education based on talent, and religion based upon humanity.</comment>

<comment>If you need development look for people going beyond caste, how Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajastan, MP, Jarkhand , Goa, etc. marching forwards, they vote for BJP development; BJP alone can include all caste, where as Lalu speaking for BC, Nitish speaking for EBC, what about forward caset, SC, ST etc? You have to choose between development based on communities & Jungle raj of caste</comment>

<comment>If you vote for Mahagathbandhan, you will never get out of caste politics, because Lalu's main election slogan is caste. Nitish Kumar is finished whether he wins or loses. If he wins, his fate will be to walk behind Lalu with a spittoon in his hands. Whenever Lalu wants to spit his pan juices, Nithish will hold the spittoon to Lalu's mouth. Nitish will become a biggest joke or a biggest tragedy of Indian politics.</comment>

<comment>if we vote for a$$h__e bahkts party, we will never get out of 5000 yr supression. feku is already the joke of the world</comment>

<comment>That is because you don't know what is happening in the world? Open your eyes & ears, it may be clocked because of caste</comment>

<comment>Ajaz Ashraf is presenting a Muslim view-point of the elections.  He has not written this article as a reporting journalist.  The BJP will win the elections in Bihar.  The press and media people who are in favor of the Congress are distorting the facts.</comment>

<comment>During last elections in Israel, Left-Centred groups along with their political mentors outside the country and their media counterparts,  tried to create an environment in which they would discourage the core Nationalist voters of Israel to come out and vote. This was their idea of defeating Benjamin Netanyahu. But Netanyahu saw through the conspiracy and appealed directly to the patriotic voters of Israel to come out and vote in large numbers on the day of the voting. And Netanyahu won eventually. Similarly today, a whole bandwagon of lies and misinformation is being preached by certain media groups to discourage NDA voters to come out and vote in the upcoming phases of Bihar election.Some 160 seats are to be polled for elections in Bihar.  Of these 160 seats, in next 2 phases, in some around 120 seats NDA is supposed to do very good. So this is an  effort to create a feeling of despair, gloom and despondency. But "Bhagvad Geeta" says----"Karmanye Vadhikaraste, Ma Phalesu Kadachana". NDA voters should do their duty and do not think of the results. They should come out and vote heavily on polling day.

<comment>I forgot about that. excellent point.</comment>

<comment>Forget all the propaganda being marketed by all the sides , but the FACT is that India / Hindu civilization has been half obliterated as the other half was surrendered to ISLAMIC JIHAD in form of Pakistan...But extremely diabolical Jihadi forces are even today labouring day in and out to invade , expand and convert whatever has left of India , and these nonsensical debates over 'sekoolarism' are cunning tools of that mission....So if you love your motherland , doesn't matters if you're an atheist or religious , kindly use your brain and learn for yourself that how fatal the rise in Muslim population would be for the Hindus...and akin to Pakistan if Hindus were in minority , by now we would have been well marginalized..Therefore , we have to raise conscience of every nationalistic Indian to make them aware about menace of cancer of Islam...</comment>

<comment>Not just about Hindu versus Muslim.  Our " way of life "  draws from "dharma" and "karma" and the concept of "live and let live". I am a proud Hindu and i know that my "way of life" is not the only "way of life" and this makes me see the best and worst in everyone, including ourselves.  That's why we must vote for development as development is religion and caste neutral.Needless to say,  this concept of hinduism needs  our political support too. Political pampering to certain religion or caste is pervasive and needs to be stopped. </comment>

<comment>yes, the evidences, all through the old history, not so old history, modern history, in current events overwhelmingly support your view point. of course, sickulars have always given us a snow job, and still are working very very hard on a snow job.</comment>

<comment>what do the divide-n-rule left loonies call different shades of opinion between wife and her husband and their kids - in a hindu family? fault lines.</comment>

<comment>How many people has Hindutva killed and how many has Prophet Muhamed of Islam killed ? Hindutva, maybe few thousands. Prophet Muhamed: 270 million, including 80 million Hindus and it is still counting. Read Quran: from beginning to end, it is just three things: 1) fear of allah 2) hate of non-muslims 3) self-contraditiction (Allah worships wind, water, air, day, night 22 times in Quran and yet asks muslims to kill and ambush polytheists)- this and many more contradictions practically in every chapter. </comment>

<comment>big time locomotion :D</comment>

<comment>Decent analysis, however there is one thing about which authour is completely wrong. It's not BJP or RSS who are are creating what authour calls hindutva controversies. It is the left-dominated media and the so called secular parties which are giving a huge hype to statements/incidents and creating the boogeyman of Hindutva and BJP.Unfortunately for the anti-BJP forces, in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand and JnK, ground reality was very different than the hype that english media tried to create and BJP won there. In Bihar, Lalu and Nitish have been decently successful in taking the english media hype to ground and thus it seems that BJPs development agenda is sort of diminished. Let's wait for the reality check on November 8.</comment>

<comment>Trolling competition will be held after the Bihar elections-If BJp wins then a beef party if Laloo and Nitish win then a pork party for all seculars.Register urself at AAPs Delhi office with Alka Lamba,click on the lauki symbol and wear a tight chaddi bcause most of the AAp volunteers are LGBT</comment>

<comment>To fir Lalu ya corrupt kongress vote de do.</comment>

<comment>To win Bihar, polling % of 70% minimum was must for BJP. with 55% polling 25% votes is enough for winning candidate. 20% of minorities will come in block to Nitish plus 5-6% he will draw from respective casts of candidates...Dadri was master stroke from secular alliance.. far enough for not uniting Hindus but close enough to unit minorities..</comment>

<comment>BJP's biggest downfall is their media strategy..... they behave like little , timid and polite students infront of media but they need to be street-shrewd S.O.B !</comment>

<comment>Not sure.. i think they need to do what is there ideology silently..Congress planted all their people in all organisation quietly.. they did communal politics, rioting, corruption quietly.. BJP will need to learn trick to to be in govt from congress.</comment>

<comment>NDA lost in 2004 due to similar skullduggery unleashed by Media...Delhi elections were also the result of same antiBJP propaganda 24 x 7.... !BJP spokies ought to by hook or crook ransack and destroy the charade of media and the journalists.......and thus , force them to be more balanced in their new narration....Else BJP are bloody doomed...coz Hindus are most gullible lambs in the world... they would rather allow themselves to be decapitated by Ghazni as a sacrifice to disease of STD (Secularism , Tolerance ,Diversity ) than realizing the real aim of Ghazni..... and hence taking a shelter away from his blood-drenched sword.. !</comment>

<comment>We need to have people who will talk one is to one for every secularist..If one secular writer is returning reward there should be other who should criticize him.. if one channel publishing dadri..other should publish Prashant case..In name of open society and freedom Hindu kids are not able to see future where they will loose their own identity.</comment>

<comment>Hey Media , Prashant Pujari too was brutally butchered by messengers of peace... !Any takers ?</comment>

<comment>No one except Zee news.Secular like ABP are organizing live drama returns of award.</comment>

<comment>Buddy.... Do all you can,  to inform everybody you know about the true nefarious antiHINDU face of Indian media.... backed by rationale and convincing facts....Else our coming generations should be ready to be treated like Kashmiri pandits...</comment>

<comment>These so called liberals forgot everything and jump to conclusions ... muslims are the only minorities in india for them.</comment>

<comment>hindus divided in caste... never going to give single hand to any party... unlike muslims flock for single party... that is why fraud secularism is still alive</comment>

<comment>No matter what Modi do or assure..Minorities never going to support him.. even if he try all secular parties and media and people in system who are recruited by congress will unite to create confusions.. Minorities are single block of 20% votes.. nobody will allow it to split and divert it's focus to welfare..secularist don't want progress of minorities they want them to be in fear so that they remain united in block and vote to whoever against Modi. This all drama of returning awards, dadri incident is because of Bihar elections.</comment>

<comment>If we stop treating them as minorities they will take off the blinkers and vote for development instead of expecting freebies.</comment>

<comment>How you will do it? majority of political parties want them to be minority , uneducated and poor .. if they start understanding about development they will desert these parties and follow parties that provide development..</comment>

<comment>Pls don't term everybody as 'Minorities' ....  Only Madarssa+Missionary converts are the conventional minority , others are as Hindus as the original... !</comment>

<comment>The term minority is a very dicy word.Parsis are minority, Jains are minority.Christians are also minority and Muslims too minority.(Both Christians and Mogals ruled India for nearly 12 centuries).Now analyse the population.India has 200 million Muslim population.Their population is more than  Russia (144million),two and half times of the population of UK(65 million),7 times of population of Australia and 54% of population of United states(322millions). Minority definition of UN should be applied.In many areas Hindus population is less in Muslim populated areas but still Hindus are not minorities.</comment>

<comment>those are 20%.. all this fight is to unit these 20% block in Bihar as there was chances of split due to entry of owaisi.. Now due to fear of BJP all will vote to single party who can defeat BJP.</comment>

<comment>Yeah , and more shrewdly by inducing fear-psychosis they have compelled Muslims to come out for voting in huge numbers...</comment>

<comment>People in politics are too smart.. wish they had used that smartness for governance..</comment>

<comment>Most voters are not concerned about hindutava or any other communal ideology.Their main concern is development.Somehow BJP's development plank is falling short of actual ground work done by Nitish in last 10 years.BJP is lacking a competent CM candidate.Biharis still trust Nitish a lot.</comment>

<comment>Biharis like Nitish...but they do not trust his party and the company he keeps...they fear jungle raj all over.</comment>

<comment>Why has the writer forgotten elections in J&K? Does he think J&K is not a part of India?</comment>

<comment>BJP won because of its Hindutva not because of some vague development slogans.Which govt in the past 6 decades didnt promise development in the elections?Even,CPM and AAP promise development.This writer moron should stick to Troll(dot)in or some left-jehadi propaganda websites.</comment>

<comment>I read the entire article with with lot of attention and did NOT find a single connecting logic. The entire article could be expressed in an one liner.</comment>

<comment>People with IQ less then 50 have this problem. You need stop asking Sangh Sarchalak another idiot like you to interpret such articles, you moron!</comment>

<comment>Ha Ha a scoundrel blabbering</comment>

<comment>Academics from IIM ( Islamify India Mission )  are convulsing and quibbling in their Burqas, as the common man has started plastering  the 'Middle Finger'  on their faces  as a reaction to  their 'Sekoolarism'  BS aka lollypop to tame Hindus ... !</comment>

<comment>the picture of a muslim boy holding a saffron BJP flag is the 8th wonder of the world</comment>

<comment>well he is not going to vote..</comment>

<comment>allah phucking bullcrap</comment>

<comment>The writer is a complete idiot. The real question is, "will voters ignore the anti-Hindu propaganda by the communal grand alliance?"</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>That had already been proved by the 2014 verdict, when Sicko's fell flat on their faces and haven't recovered yet ! Another slap is due on Nov 8 !</comment>

<comment>Isn't it a sin in Islam to write such a long article that hardly anyone reads? </comment>

<comment>Everybody reads it but most will trash it as nonsense.</comment>

<comment>No. Anything that you do to earn your bread ... sorry beef, is not a sin !</comment>

<comment>i know i did not read it beyond headline. sorry, anti hindus are not worth the time.</comment>

<comment>During last elections in Israel, Left-Centred groups along with their political mentors outside the country and their media counterparts,  tried to create an environment in which they would discourage the core Nationalist voters of Israel to come out and vote. This was their idea of defeating Benjamin Netanyahu. But Netanyahu saw through the conspiracy and appealed directly to the patriotic voters of Israel to come out and vote in large numbers on the day of the voting. And Netanyahu won eventually. Similarly today, a whole bandwagon of lies and misinformation is being preached by certain media groups to discourage NDA voters to come out and vote in the upcoming phases of Bihar election.Some 160 seats are to be polled for elections in Bihar.  Of these 160 seats, in next 3 phases, in some around 120 seats NDA is supposed to do very good. So this is an deliberate effort to create a feeling of despair, gloom and despondency. But "Bhagvad Geeta" says----"Karmanye Vadhikaraste, Ma Phalesu Kadachana". NDA voters should do their duty and do not think of the results. They should come out and vote heavily on polling day. Bharat Mata ki Jai! "Satyamev Jayate"!</comment>

<comment>It is a sin to kill, religion or no religion... #VYAPAM</comment>

<comment>Hahaha. Good laugh man. This article could have been written in ten sentences.</comment>

<comment>Why ten sentences - just 3 words are enough : Modi hai hai !</comment>

<comment>So, Let me unBURQAH yet another jaundiced news narrative of‘SEKOOLAR’ media –An Australian was questioned over ‘goddess’ tattoo on his leg and media as usual was hyperventilating, “Hindoo extremists ‘harassed’ a foreigner and hence India was shamed , growing intolerance , no place for dissent , global image was tarnished” ..BLAH BLAH BLAH ! but fortunately common Indian are now far more astute , NEWSX foolishly did a caller in debate and were smashed by informed citizens……1> People who sighted the tattoo and confronted the foreigner were local crowd , no violence or force was applied , foreigner was simply made aware of his insensitivity but infact he was the one who started abuse and violent conduct.2> The Tattoo was inked on lower leg , every chance of human waste trickling down to that tattoo while defecating or urinating , hence even as a non-religiousperson myself still I would see this situation as total desecration and worth objectionable.3> In U.S.A and Australia Indians are murdered like fleas on dog’s tail based merely over their skin colour but it does sh!t to blemish image of those nations.4> I dare any of Media ‘Free thinking Rebels’ to even mention about proposing a debate to allow image-publishing of the Model man from ‘Religion of peace’ , let alone actually printing it .5> Where the hell is ‘Sekoolarism brigade’ now ? sentiments of angels from ‘Religion of peace’ gets destroyed even on a mere request to show restrain in terms of consuming cow-meat but here a man is intentionally parading with a ‘goddess’ imprint on his leg , ready to be welcomed by urine and other bodily wastes…but the ‘Sekoolars’ yet again have proven to be rabid antiHINDU FANATICS… !Jago INDIA jago… force yourself out of this pro-ISLAMIC mental-bullying gimmickry , by these antiHINDU rodents hiding behind convenient masks of Media , Intelligentsia & liberals etc.....</comment>

<comment>Inherent in the headline itself is the basic assumption that "Hindutva" forces have gained ground. Apparently there are no Chief Ministers in this country anymore. Everyone including the most junior person in government right upto the senior most person reports to Modi directly looks like. Tomorrow people come late to office and Modi will be questioned :).</comment>

<comment>Ajaz Mian, all these incidents have happened only in your secular-ruled states - exactly like the attacks on churches ! I assure you all this will stop as soon as Bihar polls are over. One only hopes that the voters in Bihar will not be stupid like the voters of Delhi !</comment>

<comment>Voters are not stupid. They are the ultimate power from where the power of our state emanates. Ever heard of 'We the people of India........'</comment>

<comment>I feel, Modi lost an opportunity to take into confdence all including minorities. His economic policy is good but by putting fringe idiots on hold, he could have expanded his base and ruled for another 10-15 yrs without giving any reason for opposition to shout. Not sure why is he silent?</comment>

<comment>You are correct. May be RSS pressing too much? When Modi was CM of Gujarat, there was a conflict between him and RSS/VHP with VHP openly opposing him. Don't be surprised if it happens ahead too with Modi as PM.</comment>

<comment>If opposition shouting for incident in UP where SP is ruling is Modi responsible? Or some writer killing in Karnataka where Congress is ruling and all writers returning their medals is modi responsible?</comment>

<comment>I know that & I m writing this as a fan of Modi. Not sure if these fringe are creating too much trouble or media is shouting too much but Modi could have given minorties the confidence which is good for him to expand his appeal. I was expecting that with Muslims on his side he could have solved Ramjanam bhoomi issue peacefully accepted by all.</comment>

<comment>No matter what Modi do or assure..Minorities never going to support him.. even if he try all secular parties and media and people in system who are recruited by congress will unite to create confusions.. Minorities are single block of 20% votes.. nobody will allow it to split and divert it's focus to welfare..secularist don't want progress of minorities they want them to be in fear so that they remain united in block and vote whoever against Modi. This all drama is because of Bihar elections..</comment>

<comment>You are right. May be RSS pressing much? In Gujarat there was a conflict between RSS/VHP and Modi when he was CM. Don't be surprised if he do the same as PM.</comment>

<comment>All events happened during secular parties ruling respective states, still blaming Modi.. All knows very well law and order is state subject...Anyways this intellectual suppression will unite Hindus more...</comment>

<comment>The Sicko response to the unfortunate Dadri lynching:- over a 1000 articles, over 200 TV debates- not one statement condemning the chief minister- Akhilesh makes the family fly down to Lucknow instead of going there himself. Compensation Rs 45 lakhs + 4 flats + government jobs for the family. All at tax payers' expense ! Additionally, family demands free education !- no mention of the dozen other incidents post-Dadri, because no 'communal/secular' masala in the newsTo top it all, presst*tutes believe people are so stupid that they can't see through all this orchestrated mischief !</comment>

<comment>Sure, like how scamgress has to take the blame for Ayodhya demolition since it was scamgress govt at centre and state.Dude, scamgress already has enough sins on its plate. Be a woman and own up to hate mongering and rioting of your fellow chaddi(less) brigade.</comment>

<comment>Should we also own up to 2002, despite the court verdict? Have some shame mother f**ker. You've cried wolf so many times, no one gives a sh*t anymore.</comment>

<comment>I think BJP will lose, that's why they are removing Modi-Shah duo from their posters. However, the real question is, how much seat Nitish will get? Because Nitish is the face of development in Mahagatbandhan. If lalu gets more seats, it will be a big blow to development agenda.Because more seats for Nitish would mean that people haven't fallen for this caste-politics, and voted for development. Which will be big blow to caste-based politicians. Lalu will be part of the govt. but Nitish will be much less dependent on him.</comment>

<comment>Whatever seats Nitish gets, he will need Lalu to 'run' government.</comment>

<comment>Development gaya tel lene! Under Modi Vaidik times will be back. All Muslims would be converted to Hinduism! Rivers of Milk, Honey and Ghee will flow across country! Puspak Viman will beat all other plane giants like Boing etc to pulp. We will have World's deadliest missiles like Agni Baan, Vayu baan, Varun Baan etc. Ayurved will make modern medical science look like witch craft! Bhartvarsha will become Vishwa Shakti! Rishis & Munis will run the parliament of India! India will extract all the gyaan hidden in vedas. Mujhe toh abhi nasha sa aa raha hai...neend si aa rahi hai...Modi Modi Modi...zzzzzzzz</comment>

<comment>good one :)</comment>

<comment>You forgot the Saap Baan.. an arrow which converts into multiple snakes :P</comment>

<comment>So much anger.....</comment>

<comment>This is sarcasm, in case you have not heard of this word earlier!</comment>

<comment>But that shows the anger and disgust hidden inside you. Youths are angry and disgusted today</comment>

<comment>I am not exactly a youth. And you seem to be suffering from the typical disease of jumping of premature conclusions based on half baked insights. The post was only and only meant to make the believers of such thoughts feel like fools, which they are, and bring a smile on the faces of those who know better.</comment>

<comment>Presstitoots always looking for things that will "decrease Modi's sheen considerably" :)I can only salute their single minded devotion to the cause even if it means disproportionately and continually highlighting cases of "increasing intolerance" that are "ripping out our secular fabric" and "killing the idea of india"</comment>

<comment>People should elect Nitish-Lalu in Bihar.. Western states need low cost labor..</comment>
