<comment>Hi inteligent tolerent eminent gang, for you any one who is anti left,anti Gandhi's and Anti Kejri, anti maoist,anti left extreanist etc is a Bhakt for you gays ..well then let it be in that way, the same why you gang enjoy your Anti India, anti modi and anti BJP status..we are enjoying this desh bhakt status..</comment>

<comment>Audio is out on conspiracy of violence in Haryana by hooda a Congress leader. This will tell policy paralysis by bjp or violence policy of congress</comment>

<comment>Impressive command of language for a boot licker.</comment>

<comment>Not surprising, most re.tards are convent educated. Something about being convent educated screws up their brains big time I have realised.</comment>

<comment>Why you jealous if someone speaks or writes good English? Nobody asked you to read Ulysses or Maurice. These so called anti JNU are those who precisely cannot make head or tail of what the debate is all about. You need a bit of intellect to understand the basic difference between a Cubist work by a Picasso and a Braque. If you do not understand it then it also doesn't give you reason the tear up the masterpieces!!!</comment>

<comment>I have read your blogs and you didnt any sense.  Let the readers know your definition of anti nationalism.I heard her debate and certainly this piece was written for her by someone; like those questions being written for Rahul Gandhi by Scindia or Pilot.With every blog you not only proved yourself to be an ignorant character with a passion to support anti national groups.Are you an Indian or the one in the Group trying to implode the nation so that you can have your dreams fulfilled?</comment>

<comment>You are really patriotic? You know how much loot had gone from our public resources from the past and still goes on every day in the name of governance. Tell me one thing - what happens to the price differentials between a low international crude oil prices and the actual incidence on the consumers? Where do the difference disappear? Many amounts have been taken away from the social sector. Where does the money go? Who benefits from the policies geared up for rapid industrialism while no visible signs are there of having absorbed any strata of the work forces? Why has no attempt been made to understand the farmers suicides (you call it fashion and I call it  plain murder) and the lack of agricultural reforms. Listen buddy, shouting slogans like that does not make someone anti-national just as shouting "bharat mata ji jai" will not make you automatically patriot. I will be impressed if you show me your contribution towards the society, especially the deprived lot. Real patriots do not shout - they act on the ground.</comment>

<comment>A subtle message does not make sense to the majority. Mediocre minds doesn't see that  black  i s not a colour - it has several other local colours to it. Truth also has several dimensions to it. If you are satisfied being mediocre then so be it.</comment>

<comment>Mate, I can only be jealous if i cannot write and speak better English than they do. Unfortunately for them I can.  Apart from that I realise that speaking English is their only weapon because of the lack of common sense or intellect that they possess. It is only in India that these people can hide behind their knowledge of English.</comment>

<comment>If you have a problem with that why don't you ignore and use only tapodi?</comment>

<comment>If i wanted to ignore, i wouldn't be fkn commenting here and neither would you. Why don't you ignore my comments and pess off.</comment>

<comment>So defensive?? Poor kid. Perhaps using those two bid abusive words did relieve you a  bit, didn't they? You may you may I don't mind at all. You don't realize with whom you are trying to cross your swords !!! Lol lol lol....But do come back for me Id like to gauze out how well equipped are you in sane language . Just use those stupid words a bit less., they do not impress me  bit!</comment>

<comment>Ya that's because when you do not have an iota of common sense you think I am trying to impress you, when in reality i am trying to get rid of you. Go troll somebody else.</comment>

<comment>You do leave me quite disappointed . I wanted to see  a little dose of common sense not as the bhakts see it, but what is universal to all of mankind. You do not get rid of an idea. Do not get scared for an idea that is more subtle and on the higher side of the intellectual spectrum. What you do not understand does not have to be without any value. The value will define itself with your capacity to grasp at an outer orbit of reason and sanity. I don't blame you because right now you happen to be inside the confines of a heartless mob that seeks to catch a cat and proclaim - hey look here, we caught a tiger! Isnt it awesome?  There lies your logic.</comment>

<comment>Do you even read your own comments to see if you make any sense ? If i leave you disappointed, then it's pretty fkn good.  I am not here to entertain you nor teach you any common sense. You should go back to your lousy convent school or better even go to a real school where they might be able to teach you something than just English. You are the one who seems to have been hurt by my comment and unfortunately the rubbish that you are typing just makes my generalisation even more correct  that convent schooled students have their heads screwed up.</comment>

<comment>Carry on your training at the shakhas then, Why do you require to even reply my observations? If you are incapable of doing a little more deeper into any topic, then  pry no need to make any further incursions into an area where you are not supposed to. Those pathetic derision you spit out will not find buyers anywhere. Out there, you need tact and subtlety - not  boorish obscenity.</comment>

<comment>W'ever sweetheart</comment>

<comment>I think you are always defensive about anti nationals.  Who do you think you are to challenge someone on blog forum?  Instead slanging insinuations, come clear on your stand and engage intellectually with logics and facts with your opponents. Going around making wild allegations is trying to run a car either forward or backward putting the gear in neutral. You are just wasting your fuel man.</comment>

<comment>Your definition of what an anti-national is supposed to be is so severely restricted that there is a scarcity of reason and art in the entire debate. You do not invite a debate in the real scientific terms. Are you one of those who will believe if a baba suddenly comes and tells us the in his dream he saw the Lord  asked him to sacrifice a few kids for the betterment of the society. Everyone will be prosperous. Then you simply carry out his wishes without any empirical evidence or reasonable analysis. The reason is that you need a short cut explanations to any thing that appears to be out of sync with your perceived democratic sensibilities. I was putting my deliberations for those who have a reasoning over a problem. But in case you are from the mob then I have nothing more to say because that would be more futile.</comment>

<comment>We all know you are one of those arm pit lickers of mom and son duo.  Your idiotic and vituperative TV debate shows were enough to judge your character.You said arrest in JNU was a ploy and a design to install facist regime.  Have you forgotten the facist emergency imposed by your party on the country?  Have you forgotton what your own Congress mouth piece Congress Darshan said about your leaders and the party.  For your memory, it wrote that Congress leader Sonia Gandhi's father belonged to facist group and sided with Hitler.JNU was allowed to drag by your government and its time to draw a line.  The line has to be drawn for the national integrity and security of this country.   You may not want the country to remain united as you are convinced that your party can never win the elections in a United India.  Hence, the attempts are to create a small fiefdom for your queen and her son and carve out a State to remain the rulers of that small piece of land.The people of India will never allowyou to achieveyour dreams and every effort will face popular revolt from common people who will not comprise anti nationals, terrorists, and religious zealots.</comment>

<comment>JNU stood up to any bully even in the past. So do not try to paint it only with one brush. It was far more vocal against the Congress regime. So do a reality check up before thinking or imagining that it is only after BJP. If AAP comes to power some day it's duty will also to keep them on its toes. It is a precursor to any democracy. read where it started (Athens) and then make brushing statements like the one you do so eagerly.</comment>

<comment>You need get all your senses to act in a synchronization to get a correct perspective about the happenings in JNU.  JNU residents are no "touch us not" community who are beyond the laws of this nation.   What reality check are you talking about?  It is the duty of any government, including the leftists if they ever come to rule, to protect the unity and integrity of the nation. Every individual or any group who wows to fight the union of India and eke on waging a war against the country till its destruction may be darlings to you but not to those millions outside the JNU compound.  If the govt. does not deal with these traitors in a manner as they should be dealt with, the public will handle them.JNU does not have the copy right for freedom of speech or action or choice. They have to be accountable and responsible to enjoy these freedoms.   As long as they do not, they will be hauled up and if you dare you too will be.</comment>

<comment>Your school of thought is the exact replica of what Indira Gandhi tried to do. Remember that if you have a short memory. If you want to wank into her shoes then the people are not so stupid to tolerate that. The handful of you who claim to be the epitome of nationalist are actually fake pretenders out there to market the cola just as these fake babas did market karma Kola! So no need to get so much paranoid about academic or artistic licences. Your actual failure to address real issues make you fool the public by saying"look here, we have caught this guy who has been responsible for all our problem!" How much more stupid could you become. You use the nationalism hashtag to further your grip on all democratic institutions to pave the way fr the Heil Hitler philosophy in times to come. But remember, India has far too much diversity to tolerate your bullying techniques. You just try that and you will regret. A few twitter accounts shouting hoarsely like the professional mourners cant represent the multitudes who want your action in the real issues - not imagined and conjured up images just to fool the people. get that boy.</comment>

<comment>Get on with the news that the goons now surrendered to the laws.They should now be rusticated from the university.</comment>

<comment>Don't be so fast. We all know who are the goons. Those who try to manufacture lies for their own political ends are the goons and you have been fed with a concoction of conspiring media footages which you believe to be  gospel truths.</comment>

<comment>Rajen Babu you seem to have been mired in your own confusions.  You take a stand and state that working against the Indian Union and its destruction is not anti national act.  When you take a stand, we can debate ; till such time grow up.</comment>

<comment>Valid points!! With a slew of fake videos making rounds, let SC decide who's the culprit that raised those anti-national slogans and punish him accordingly. Until that happens - the mantra should be - innocent until proven guilty.And I had a good laugh at the Tsunami analogy. LOL.But why can't Congress saddle up and reshuffle the leadership and try to limp back to form. A good and responsible opposition is as much a necessity as a good ruling party. You guys have to do something. Your points will sound legitimate and genuine if you have a party that is worthy of representing. At this point, Congress looks like a mad house full of sloth bear.</comment>

<comment>It looks patriotism and Nationalism are anathema to these people. The Govt formulated many schemes and policies, which will change the face of India. There is no paralysis of governance, only paralysis to corrupt people and practices for which you are feeling uncomfortable. Modi sinned for not allowing Bofors scandals, Spectrum scams, coal scams, commonwealth games scams, defense purchase scams etc. He may be excused for that. You will not allow the Parliament to function and you label it policy paralysis. If any body condemns, hate braggers, terrorist supporters, I.S.I  pawns you label it intolerance and false glorification of Nationalism and patriotism. Hate speeches made by the so called student leaders is music to your years. Sorry gentlemen, the country is watching your mind game and false propaganda.</comment>

<comment>Dear Madam, It is not BJP's doing but for journalists like you, every bad thing happening is diversion by BJP. I look at the happenings differently.First Hyderabad, then JNU and now Jadavapur are created to dislodge BJP from power by political parties opposed to this Govt same as 'Award Wapsi' drama was carried out.</comment>

<comment>"Paralysis of governance". The author is creating new phrases to point out nothing but her emptiness. It was the former government UPA that suffered for a whole decade, unable to extricate itself from economic woes. The Harvard educated economist as the Indian Prime Minister, the one who was responsible for transforming Indian socialist economy  to the market economy, ended up a mere puppet at the hands of an illiterate house wife and her son. The famous quote by President Obama " when Sing speaks the world listens" was not uttered merely to lure the Indian economist together with India's economy that began to rise up due to liberalization, but stated with absolute conviction about an emerging economy. However, the moment Mr. Sing was appointed as the country's Prime Minister, his wings were clipped by the Gandhi duo that brought in the economic down fall. Eventually, India began to  lose her clout and shining India became to dim as Indian economy lost due to policy paralysis. Congress's vote bank policy overwhelmed and subdued  the greater economic policies.  The Prime Minister became a mere tool unable to extricate or rather unwilling to renounce his crown as the Prime Minister of India, became  mute almost paralyzed  physically and mentally. The country failed to move for a decade. Policy paralysis stuck India and there was total paralysis of governance. Under the NDA, Mr. Modi as the Prime Minister, it is for all of us  and for the world, specially to the author to see a resurgent India with the economy growing 7 to 8%. The author is a member of the club of Rahul, who at each and every progressive step taken by the present government views with his  frowned eyes. After all the perception of the author and Rahul is that the leadership means pointing the accusing finger all the time at the leader of the country and going even to the extent of supporting  Afzal Guru and anti nationals who raise slogans against the country. The author must delve into the past for a moment to learn about  the corruption , lawlessness and paralysis of both policies and governance  that stalled Indian progress for a long 10 years. Paralysis of governance prevailed then not now.</comment>

<comment>FP is afraid that their Sandipan, akshaya Mishra, Tariq Anwar has failed miserably to garner public support and sympathy to anti-national scums, they imported an author directly from anti-national's head quarter that is Congress.</comment>

<comment>seems the bhakt trolls have 'anti national' stickers with them....which are pasted on anyone with a different point of view.... none want to apprehend the culprit lawyers or speak of the doctored video....any talk of that and the sticker is put liberally</comment>

<comment>Even your poll says no. Btw, look at the hypocrisy.  The "yes" answer is obvious. But the "no" answer is imaginary. Chal bhonk...</comment>

<comment>Although, we know it, her article that she reinforces that is a congressi.</comment>

<comment>Only action hurting the nation is prevented by state in USA. Even burning of National flag is taken as talk and government protects the Individual right to do so in USA.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As Arun Shourie said BJP government is congress + Cow. He is following in ditto Congress divisive policies - and he has Huge support. I know the problems originated  from congress and left. But the problem is Modi given his huge support may use it to betray his supporters and go in for private sector reservations - which congress and left dare not do, without invoking great unrest.Can Kanhaiya Kumar as PM bring reservation in private sector? He will not be successful in doing it?I just changed my mind. To Bhakts. Wake up. If you are a BJP supporter you will be sold. Look at how Jats will get reservation by reservation thuggery. Jat leaders who caused widespread destruction, who are anti-national in deed are rewarded. From the looks of it BJP will go for private sector reservations. Vote for Kanhaiya Kumar the genius as PM. It is positively dangerous to support Modi. Surrender to Jat reservation policy shows India is a Ocholocracy [mob rule] where individual [smallest minority]rights are by definition murdered. Dont find fault with me - the problem is Constitution of India which allows it.What about those Jat leaders who did something very real and very anti-national[widespread destruction]?  Solicitor General, Hegde, make a scientific comparison of laws in India and USA.  In principle any TALK has to be allowed. State comes into the picture to stop a action which hurts the nation. In USA burning of National Flag is allowed as it is considered as Talk and not action harmful to Nation.Congress government did not ratifiy [made into laws] 1988 United Nations resolution on Torture. It shares august company of states such as Sudan and North Korea. Rajan was tortured, killed and his dead body was fed to pigs during emergencySeveral provisions within the Indian Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and various national security related laws provide immunity to these officials. Section 197 of the CrPC allows for all-encompassing immunity by providing that the Central or state government in question must grant sanction for the prosecution of any government official … alleged to have committed a criminal offence “while acting or purporting to act within the discharge of his official duty.” The Supreme Court has upheld this provision and has stated that even those who abuse their power are considered to be “acting or purporting to act” in their official position and thus enjoy immunity.=======================================================When a person scores above 94% and another gets same seat for 49% in an EXAMINATION when the examiners dont know the examinees then merit does not exist because it has been murdered. A person who was murdered did exist. So also merit.Mixed economy is a fascist economy. Bureaucracy/mafia politician becomes the supreme arbiter. Consider reservation policy: The only work of a government is protection of Individual rights - Jefferson, 2nd president of USA.. President of India as head of state has to commit suicide as merit, an Individual right, is murdered by reservation policy. The state is duty bound to protect Individual from mobs. Such arguments are not answered but ignored -- what the state does is right. Nazism was stateism like socialism. Those who could obtain power could justify state-sponsored murder and plunder by pointing out that since morals don't really exist and are merely a product of one's class or upbringing, there is no moral argument against the state version of murder and plunder.Socialism introduced into constitution during emergency is legal robbery. Way forward is capitalism[another name of freedom]Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim’s gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of money taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials and mafia politicians.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, but that it cannot be used honestly.Why does not the state allot a seat strictly on merit and snatch it away OPENLY?Gandhian Socialism of BJP is Gandhiism [selling of ones supporters to gain support of Jinnah and Muslims and Socialism is legal robbery]</comment>

<comment>Politically incorrect:"When a person scores above 94% and another gets same seat for 49% in an EXAMINATION when the examiners dont know the examinees then merit does not exist because it has been murdered.

<comment>Try Osama As Hero Event in USA .... US govt. will make you disappear.</comment>

<comment>Stupid, while Osama can be compared with Dawood or Hafiz in India, he cannot be compared with Afzal whose entire case is a debated one. He was not directly involved in leadership or violence like Osama or Dawood or Hafiz. But he was said to be an accomplice.</comment>

<comment>Ok ! I thought Indian supreme court hanged him after prolonged 10 year case  ! so where you were hiding 10 years . Is it fashion ?Ishrat Jahan you said same ! Yakub you said same ! Afazl you said same !You criminals even jailed Honest officer in ishrat jahan case ... you people are criminal minded evils .you people are nothing but useful idiots for enemies of India.Stupid  about OSAMA same thing can be said , Saddam Hussein hanged even if they didn't find even single chemical weapons (In his own country LOL ! this is America)Vikram Buddhi  jailed for years for  facebook post  which their Own intelligence agency denied that post was his and he is no way threat.whom you telling ? ..... you stupids are fooled by enemies ... Inviting destruction of India.</comment>

<comment>I said nothing for any of these guys. Court sentenced them and their cases are over. In case of Ishrat, there was no court involved. And a terrorist's statement of David Hadley cannot be the last word for a govt. My point is they are gone: we cannot NOW make our lives hell through violence in courts, streets, campuses etc while Police just stands.</comment>

<comment>shame on you guys !  you still defending terrorist Ishrat ... you telling me that Indian girl encountered with two Pakistani national terrorist was innocent ! Girl which declared "Shahid" by Paki terrorist organization.She must have been doing Party with Two Pakistani terrorist then .David Hadley Who is in USA custody (not siting in his home)... who exposed whole Mumbai attack Gave name of all the conspirators including ISI guys  ... is not trust worthy ?India has No future if Indian fail to protect internal Fools like you who are weapon for enemies of India.One thing i am sure abt every hyped terrorist will be declared innocent  by you guys onwards .and Mumbai attack by RSS guys.</comment>

<comment>go to the grave with him profess and give him eternal companionship</comment>

<comment>Before saying all this, you have to confirm you don't believe in indian judiciary who sentenced him to death through legal means? Govt's don't give death penalties and it was anyways given under UPA regime.</comment>

<comment>moron, there is no debate about Afzal except in that fringe groups among commies and islamists. He was found to have supported the terrorists in parliament attack and was convicted rightly. SC only putforth a stringent sentece as it did not see the difference between actual weapon slashing terrorist and covert terrorist afzal. what it did is absolutely right.</comment>

<comment>You are absolutely mistaken! There are many who believe that Afzal should not have been killed, for various reasons - some dont believe in capital punishment, some dont believe in proofs presented were clear in pointing to his involvement and some believe he was just made a scapegoat by an incompetent Govt. Certainly not fringe groups only. So what exactly is your problem if someone wants to debate his hanging?</comment>

<comment>Yes debating the hanging is ok....but why do students have to do this? The univ. is running on govt. grants, tax payers money.....so why can't they concentrate on studies? Students are spending years to graduate from this college. They are in their 20s and 30s....have they seen and experienced the world so much that they think they know it all and its their duty to do all this?</comment>

<comment>Let them live in their denial of reality but that can not be the excuse to shout "Hindustan ki barbaadi" or "Bharat tere tukde honge"....I hope you have iq more than a punter.</comment>

<comment>Powerful USA pursues  its enemies even beyond its borders. Its OWN citizens are treated differently.Weak Ocholocratic [mob rule] India where by definition Individual rights like merit are murdered does the exact opposite.</comment>

<comment>very very true...its a very good ploy to divert attention from record breaking rupee value against dollar, pathetic make in india plan, cess tax for nothing, petrol diesel prices increased with excise duty, cancer drugs price increase, lpg subsidy removal, black money jumla, ram mandir jumla, service tax hit on common man etc etc...chutiyaa bhakts</comment>

<comment>You need to see things in perspective...Depreciating rupee: look at how china is devaluing its currency, indian exports are going down and oil is cheap..also read the RBI governor's comment and try to understand what REER stands for..you will get your answerMake in India : You cant dismiss an idea before giving it enough time to bear fruitCess tax : What makes you thing the funds collected are not being utilized for the purpose they are collected..please share factsCancer drug price increase : Valid point and govt needs to actLPG Subsidy : Educate yourselfJumlas : Comparable to garibi hatao hiven in 1980 haha</comment>

<comment>Seeking your valuable inputs here:1. Why is Petrol diesel price so high when the crude oil prices are at an all time low and there is a glut all around?2. Why does the prices of essential commodities like Dal so high even though the WPI (wholesale price inflation) is so low? 3. Cess tax? Why should I pay for cess tax when taxes are paid on income, sales, services, VAT? what initiatives are taken by MoNa govt on Swach Bharat apart from taxing already taxed people?4. Prices of medicines have almost doubled since 2014. Medicines used for day to day basis are expensive now. Who is pocketing this?5. Aura of no-corruption: What is Modi Govt doing when Reliance stole the gas from Government owned KG basin by drilling close to Govt owned blocks and sucking gas worth 10000 crs..Is this the payment for funding Narendra modi's election campaign? Why is he keeping quiet on Vyapam scam, Lalit Modi cover up?6. Make in India: Why does Modi not focusing on infrastructure and reviving the manufacturing sector by reviving the demand? Make in India pledges of $220B are not worth anything unless it gets converted to projects. Until then it is just a pledgePlease enlighten</comment>

<comment>1. Look at the govt money inflows and outflows..  A mere 2.7% of the people pay income taxes and the duties on the fuel form a major portion of govt revenue. On the expenditure side there is loads of not so productive expenditure that just keeps growing…MNREGA, bloated and scantily productive workforce, re-capitalization of PSU banks and provision of services like Railways at artificially controlled prices ( try travelling the same distance by rail in Europe and you will end up paying 10 times more). The govt. has no choice but to keep the price high and collect as much indirect revenue as it can to manage all this to keep its deficits low and maintain an investment grade sovereign rating. Hopefully the govt will utilize this money productively.2. The WPI is not an indicator of absolute price levels. It just calculates the rate of increase in prices between 2 periods. If the prices were high in previous periods and are high in this period, WPI will be very low with high price levels. Other possible reason is that Dal is not weighted highly in the overall index. Supply shortages/hoarding could be other issues that govt should look into.3. The concept of hygiene unfortunately is not ingrained in indian culture and will take time to percolate ( I live in Dubai and you can easily identify Indians dominated areas by the filth on the roads..) . We should, therefore, not expect immediate results. The people are atleast talking about hygiene and hopefully this will bear result. On cess, yes, there needs to be a mechanism to monitor the end use and if after a year data shows that the money is not being used for the purpose for which it is collected, cess should be discontinued..4. I don’t live in India so can’t comment on this one. If the prices have indeed doubled in 2 years (across board and not for patented medicines) than it is a cause of concern and govt needs to act.5 Please read “polyester prince” to understand how much clout Reliance weilds in India…it is supported by all colors so not fair to blame one party here. On Vyapam, I am form MP and know for sure that there is lot of action going on to nail the culprits. Media has stopped following this does not mean there is no progress. Modi cannot and should not be expected to speak on each and every topic. You have a full govt and state govts to do that. It was wrong for BJP to expect MMS to speak on each and every issue and likewise for congress now. Lalit Modi, yes, should have been handled better.On an overall basis, you have to give the credit to this govt that so far none of the central ministers has been accused of financial irregularity. Quality of ministers…well no govt other than NDA1 was known for the quality of its ministers..6. Please follow websites of power and infra ministries for updates as also twitter handle of Piyush Goyal. In a way currency depreciation is aimed at making Indian goods more competitive globally and support manufacturing. Make in India, fair point but keep in mind that no one will invest in India ( or anywhere else for that matter) unless there is assurance on infra, law and order and friendly taxation. That’s something that govt needs to do to convert commitment to investment on ground. Again, it is too early to judge. If even 10-15% of this is invested on the ground in next 3-4 years..it will be huge..or else, just another gimmick.</comment>

<comment>three pegged? :D how jittery have I made you!</comment>

<comment>I think the left and congress are ganging up to create controversy after controversy because they still haven't recovered from the 2014 shock. This JNU issue is being given so much coverage, whereas there is very little coverage for the people dying in Haryana or the soldiers dying in Kashmir. Frankly, I don't think the aam aadmi is too much concerned about freedom of speech of JNU students, they have spoken more in the last few days than in their whole lives probably. But the media is also playing its role in hyping up this issue. I would love to see more balanced news with important things happening all over the country instead of this focus on Delhi.</comment>

<comment>Back stabbing is congress' nature.  The Party was an integral part of the all party meeting met and decided to release Azhar Mahmood.  Check your facts when you post something for public consumption.  The nation is doing good and you all know that given five years, the man will take the nation much ahead and if given another term the man will make you forget everything.  There is a saying that to know whether the rice has cooked just see one rice! I give a simple example.  Urea to farmers which is subsidized but black marketing is rampant as Urea is used for other purposes as well.  The Modi government simplye made mandatory to coat Urea with neem! This has effectively put an end to blackmarketing and farmers do get sufficient quantity of Urea! There are many such things whihc you and the biased media wont put out!</comment>

<comment>Yes, it is a ploy by BJP and RSS. I know the people who operate canteens in JNU where students eat. They have informed that a herb called "Buddhinashak Bhasm" supplied by Baba Ramdev to ABVP members was secretly mixed in students' food. After eating the contaminated food many students went awry and started shouting anti-India slogans.All this happened due to that herb you know.</comment>

<comment>hahahaha</comment>

<comment>paralysis created by Congress ?</comment>

<comment>It is the congress which is shit scared and resorting to violence and I can list it out:1. Rohit Vemula in Hyderabad.2. Jat Riots in Haryana(where an audio has surfaced and the PA to BSH has admitted to his voice)3. Patel stir in Gujarat!4. Working up the media for Dadri!</comment>

<comment>One common thread in all the ruckus happening in the universities -- It is ABVP.IIT Madras, Hyderabad University and now JNU.</comment>

<comment>Will any of the esteemed readers will kindly explain what is governance paralysis! The one run by MMS with the remote in the hands of SG or the current one which is run by a PM who is by far the best we have got so far.  The less said about Rahul is better for the congress.  The guy cannot memorise answers for the questions, gets embarassment by asking stupid questions to the students.  He has cut a sorry figure wherever he goes.  This is what his capability is. Above all we have even seen him carrying bits of paper inside the Parliament for speech.Now, as far as questioning his patriotism or nationalism is concerned we need to look at two things very practically.  At the initial times when Rahul was being groomed every one or atleast most of the people in India would have thought that we will get a young leader who will be dynamic and educated in western country and will bring issue based politics in India and will take our country forward. There were high hopes on Rahul then as we had hopes on Kejriwal now.  What did Rahul deliver in return?  Same old story.  Parrotting the lines given to him by Digvijay Singh who is a failed politician and leader andbecause of whom Congress lost a big state, and a state where people dont want to see him leave alone electing him back and Jairam RAmesh who thinks that there is only one Birbal and thats him.  Now, Rahul as a politician after being in politics for more than a decade, is the first repeat first youth icon(that is what congresis call him) to have openly played vote bank politics over the death of Rohit Vemula.  Please note here that even Akhilesh or none from SP did such politics. Then comes JNU! That JNU is a den of commies is a well known fact and if PC or RG does not know, that will only show that how ignorant they are.  Secondly here the question was of the slogans BHARAT KI BARBADI THAK JUNG RAHEGI, BHARAT TERA TUKDE HONGE, KILLERS OF AFZAL STILL ALIVE - these are all not protest slogans.  By questioning Killers of Afzal being alive they are questioning the President of India who is the head of state and after whose rejection of all mercy petitions that Afzal was hanged.  If we want to politicise this we can even say that Afzal was hanged by the UPA government.  But this dumb leader goes to JNU meets the students and tells them that the party is with them for an incident carried out by his own government and was supporting anti India slogans.  If  that is not the case, look at the statements made by RG: 1. I need no certificate from any body to prove by patriotism.  Sensing that he made a blunder by visiting JNU and making this statements.  Very next day he just somersaults and says PATRIOTISM RUNS IN MY BLOOD AND MY FAMILY HAS SACRIFICED LIVES! Now any sane mand worth his salt and not a dumb like RG will rightly question ones nationalism! Because when you yourself is confused what the hell are u preaching the publi! Now let the readers decide!</comment>

<comment>Whom you fooling ? with Every passing day ... congress becoming pathetic Diminishing dynasty ruled by Corrupt daughter of Nazi soldiers whose son support anti-India activities    </comment>

<comment>So BJP wanted divert India's away from the Make in India week (that was taking place at the same time) and the 15 lakh crore investment that was achieved in the week? Seriously, are you retarded?</comment>

<comment>INR 15 lakh crore i.e. USD 223 Bn, investment achieved. Exactly what DOES that mean? What is the meaning of investment achieved?</comment>

<comment>it is MoUs I guess.</comment>

<comment>Boss, these are pledges.. translation promises.We should be happy if they convert into contracts or MOUs..So don't jump the gun</comment>

<comment>Yes. Correct. About jumping the gun, professionally, I sell projects, ranging in value from $ 10 MM to $ 100 MM. I actually have an idea of the meaning of MOUs, of the kind of discussions that happen from MOU to Proposals to Letter of Acceptance to Letter of Intent or Letter of Award to Contract Signing. While any conversions, even 1 conversion is better than no (zero) conversions, terming the MOUs of $ 220 Bn as 'investments' is more akin to jumping the gun.</comment>

<comment>Still better than not having pledged or promised anything like in UPA 2's rule even Indian industrialists were threatening to invest overseas rather than in India. Once they convert, it will be even better as you have said.</comment>

<comment>Why do you want to prick bubbles. Let them dream on. </comment>

<comment>Seriously Liberals,What is your problem with patriotism? How is loving one's own country a bad thing? It is like calling people selfish because they love their kids.</comment>

<comment>Who said Liberals don't love the country?Or what makes you think that only Hindus (ardent and bhakts) love India? Do you know what % of India pay taxes 3% or 4 Crores. Those who avoid taxes are anti-nationals. And this 3% includes Hindus, muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs, parsis, Jains, Liberals, conservatives, socialists, Marxists, OCs, BCs, OBCs, SC/STs etc..... That's democracy for you..These are people who work in Government institutions, PSUs, State govt jobs, Central govt jobs etc.So take your phony patriotism elsewhere!</comment>

<comment>If you really love India then why are you supporting people who said that they would wage war till India is destroyed? huh?Hypocrisy much? Take your snobby liberalism elsewhere.</comment>

<comment>I agree. I am not supporting people who shouted anti India solgans. That's why I hate ABVP and RSS.The videos circulated on Feb 9th blaming JNU students Kanhaiya and others are proved FAKE.Humble pie..huh?</comment>

<comment>Proved fake?where?in your dreams? give me the link of your source. then I will eat humble pie.</comment>

<comment>Loving your country is not at all a bad thing. It is the saying " You will love your country in the manner and nature that " Nationalists " prescribe." that is the objection. Some people might think loving the country might just be to carry on with being good citizens, but not neccesarily wanting to sob over national flags etc. It might also be good to call out on the faults of the country, simply because we love the country, not just be blind devotees.It is indeed selfish to only love our kids and not discipline them when they are wrong. That doesn't mean we need to put the kids in prison too. A stern parent is also loving and not a retributive one. </comment>

<comment>Gaby,lets say you have a daughter. She was threatened by a grown up man in her school/college saying that he would not rest till she is destroyed(even though your daughter didn't do anything wrong. he just blindly hates her). Don't you get anger over him? What would you do as a mother? Would you be like "ok. he just expressed his opinion/hate about my kid. It is freedom of speech. It is his right" and keep quiet? or Would you ACT by alerting authorities or even police and make sure he is punished and won't be a threat to your kid in future?I hope you understood what I am trying to say here. Those JNU students shouted that they would continue their war till India is destroyed. Tell me how can any person who likes his/her country not get mad over them(of course that's only when one feels India as his/her own). Where does the concept of "blind devotion" towards the country came here? We want to take action against those students just like how you want action against that man,so that they won't be a threat in future. Govt did the same. They presented them before court and Trial is going on. I don't understand why you people are criticizing govt over this issue. They did what they should. Regarding the assault outside the court,those lawyers were also arrested and presented for trail.Why do you liberals have to degrade patriotism/patriots like the author of above article? The points which you raised come under jingoism not patriotism. I too oppose jingoism. No one is asking you people to follow template and prove your patriotism but we are asking you to not support anti nationals just  because of your political prejudices which is BJP hate in this case</comment>

<comment>Just by fueling pseudo-nationalism BJP is trying to divert the country from the real issues. the fact is Modi government is a failure...Failure is the not the right word, when he won with absolute majority. He has squandered it away.Also he is not the leader in BJP led government. The real leader is RSS and Mohan Bhagwat. they call the shots. That's why a man with 56 inch chest cannot even open his mouth on critical issues in the country, unless he is ordered to do so.Point is, Modi and BJP government are trying hard to polarize the country..First they tried Hindus against muslims - that backfired very badly in Bihar and will backfire in Kerala, Assam and WB elections.Then they tried tinkering with educational institutions: IIT Madras, FTII, Hyderabad University, JNU and probably Aligarh Muslim University and more... They know very well that voices of dissent will be difficult to suppress especially from Students...so they have whipped up the anti-national phobia pitting common man against each other.Don't we have bigger and immediate problems to focus? What is happening to the economy? Prices are all time high, poverty is very bad, jobs growth is not happening, Essential commodities hoarding is rampant, Infrastructure is crumbling, Education sector needs revival, our armed forces equipment needs major overhaul. MoNa (NaMo's soft alter ego) cannot maintain the blamegame any more..People have realized and tired of his tirade. That's why this diversionary politics and it is going to backfire on BJP in a big way.BTW: where was your ultra nationalist avatar before 2014?</comment>

<comment>The weakest bit in your argument is that there is a difference between an actual person and the concept of a nation. When there is threat to the actual state of the country, we have strong responses. A mere slogan should not merit such strong hand measures. Let's us not yet patriarchal by dragging daughters into this issue.This nation belongs to these youth too, if they did indeed engage in these slogans. They could have a genuine grievance or they might be misguided. Either ways there are different ways to handle this - address grievance or address the misguided attitude sternly. Don't drag in sedition, which is a remnant of British colonialism. The anti national stance needs to be proven and proven in a court of law - not in television channels or by jingoistic chaps. Till the Delhi High Court states its verdict, I will rest my case.I do not hate the BJP. I hold them in contempt, just as much as I have contempt for the Congress, Islamist parties and the Communist parties. </comment>

<comment>Oh,I didn't know that  if we speak about daughters the conversation becomes  patriarchal. May be the definition of patriarchy in your dictionary is different from mine. FYI,I used daughter not son so that when I use pronouns like he or him you wouldn't get confused about who I was referring to.Anyways, I am indeed aware of the difference between a person and nation. But the point you have totally missed here is that I was talking about love not the number of people. you would get angry if some one abuses/threatens your loved ones. right? Everyone would. That loved ones may be a single person or a group of people,friends,family or a whole nation but love is same in all the cases. That was my point. Regarding JNU issue, that Loved one is my country itself. I will not tolerate if someone abuses/threatens it just like how you wouldn't tolerate in your kid's case.  May be the reason why you are not mad over JNU like us  is because you don't love India as much as we do. May be that's why you think we are over reacting. That is absolutely fine. We don't want/expect  you to understand it either. But at least try not to support anti nationals like this.grievance or misguided students? seriously? If some road side romeo passes lewd comments on you/your daughter while walking on the road, would you say he is  "misguided" or he is  doing that because of harmones/testosterone effect in his body and he should be handled gently? Do you even realize how ridiculous you sound? If we tolerate these people like this they would cause more damage tomorrow. They need to be punished appropriately and thus send  a proper message across the society so that this won't be repeated.I am also saying the same that let's wait till the verdict is pronounced instead of entertaining the political conspiracies like in the above article and bashing the govt/patriots. Just tell me what wrong did the govt do as far as this case is concerned. Some people broke laws(sedition) in IPC. they got arrested and presented before court and trail is going on.  If proven guilty they will be punished else get released. This is the standard procedure which any civilized democratic country follows. What are you blaming govt for here? If you don't like sedition law itself then blame the  law makers. It is actually you people and opposition parties  who are making noise about this and not letting other issues get coverage in media.</comment>

<comment>You don't love the country more than others. You just get outraged easily and shout louder. Perhaps, we the daughters, take so much from all kinds of men, are more tolerant. </comment>

<comment>Aww.. how sweet!  playing the gender card now. are we?</comment>

<comment>My only fault was to write two responses in one post.1. No you don't neccesarily love the country more than any other. You do get upset pretty fast and shout a bit louder.2. Since you keep raising the issue of daughters getting teased by louts, I will respond by saying the teasing inures us as well as teaches us greater degrees of tolerance.Make what you will, of my two responses, again crammed into one post.</comment>

<comment>1. The reason why we get upset more is because we love our country more.  I mean,when do you get more upset? when your kid is abused or your  neighbour's kid is abused. be honest. your kid.  right? why? because you love him/her more. you feel possessive about them. Same logic can be applied to country's love as well. you don't love country that much. hence you don't have any problem with some one degrading or abusing it. simple.2. Sure, I agree with your second point.</comment>

<comment>Point 1.To use your own analogy,  There is a difference in whistling louts and a sexual assault. Stupid young men crying horrible slogans is different from rampaging terror attacks. We should treat all of these things with stern action, but each of these with appropriate measure and proportion. What supposedly happened in JNU deserves the University to step down hard. Neither police action nor this wailing/ teeth gnashing/ chest beating of hyper nationalism. </comment>

<comment>Oh for God's sake they broke the (sedition) laws in Indian penal code. In any civilized democratic country, if you break the law,you get arrested by police. simple.They broke the law - complaint was filed- police arrested them- produced them before the court - will keep them in custody till judgement unless they get bail- if proven guilty,they will get punished else get released. This is the procedure any democratic country in the world follows. our police followed the same. The process is in 5th stage currently i.e keeping them in custody till judgement.Just because it happened inside some college campus doesn't mean only college administration should act. When they broke the law it became a law and order issue. Hence police are involved. It has nothing to do with hyper nationalism.</comment>

<comment>Listen , everybody can see where you come from , ok !  so lets keep it straight...... There are people in the country who are systematically nurtured to think in an insular narrow  mindframe , where India is ought to be a fertile breeding ground for lslamic conquest and none can think otherwise..But  there are others who resist and oppose cancer of islam and are well aware of  the manner where more than half of Greater India was chopped off by machinations of Islamic extremists+Congress+Commie+Folks as yourself..Hence the clash is between two sects : One endorsing Islamic dominance and other challenging this long hanging pestilence...</comment>

<comment>You are so addicted to this hatred of any diversity and Islam. Nothing could be further from the truth, when you say folk like me want Islamic dominance. The truth is, folk like me don't want anybody to dominate. We would like to get on with life with its myriad beauty. Equal chance for Biriyani and Idli- sambhar. Equal chance for Subbulakshmi, Siddeshwari Devi and Mohammed Rafi.Good luck in your psychological conflict. </comment>

<comment>You hit a home run with these lines -> "The truth is, folk like me don't want anybody to dominate. We would like to get on with life with its myriad beauty. Equal chance for Biriyani and Idli-sambhar. Equal chance for Subbulakshmi, Siddeshwari Devi and Mohammed Rafi."</comment>

<comment>At the cost re-iteration.....don't even in a sarcastic overtone address them as 'Liberals'  as they take its meaning literally ,  call them Islamic fanatics to expose their real agenda..</comment>

<comment>Exactly. They are ruining the name of liberalism by calling themselves liberals.</comment>

<comment>Yeah and this article is a ploy  by Congress to divert attention from Links of Congress with Jihadis... !</comment>

<comment>She should first ask herself why Afzal was hanged by UPA, that too in a cowardly fashion ( not informing their kith & kin about the Hanging & burying the body ). LOL!</comment>

<comment>so why is the bjp so riled up over the fault of UPA thats the real question hereABVP objected to the event</comment>

<comment>LOL. BJP is not riled up over the fault of UPA. BJP is riled up over Anti-India Sloganeering. That Sloganeering is considered seditious as per the laws. If someone comes & threatens you of destroying your home? What will be your reaction?</comment>

<comment>Soapera!Don't you know that the videos are proved fake? Who provided the videos in the first place?Anyone who tries to break the harmony of India is Anti-Indian. Good try by the way.Didn't you read the news on Chennai floods. That was a natural disaster. What happened?1. Muslims opened their mosques to let women and children stay till the floods recede2. Muslims entered temples to cook food for people3. Christian man saved the lives of many people giving free rides4. Muslim Doctor worked tirelessly to conduct pregnancies and saved the lives of many mothers and babies5. People came from every walk of life to provide food, water, clothes irrespective of religion, caste, creed, languageThis is the harmony that BJP, RSS, ABVP are trying hard to break. BJP can go the gutter route to make this work..But unfortunately for them "truth alone triumphs"By tinkering with universities and students, they have touched a raw nerve. If students unite no tsunami can stop them.</comment>

<comment>Not all videos are proved fake. The anti-India slogan videos were genuine. And btw there were plenty of photos of RSS helping Chennai flood victims like they always do. </comment>

<comment>as i understand it the ABVP objected to the event held on feb 9, which questioned the "judicial killing of afzal" (supposed to be the fault of the UPA) and started sloganeering against the other side (which was reported provocative by some JNU students) and some students who may not even belong to the JNU came in and started those anti-india sloganeering and the BJP claimed that there were proof of that particular event(which turned out to be doctored).the  only fault of kanhaiya which is proven is that he gave a speech against the RSS.</comment>

<comment>The video was genuine, the doctored videos were different which tried to prove Kanhaiya was part of that group. The anti-India slogan videos are not doctored.</comment>

<comment>Is this author , The  Congressi Spokeswoman ==> Priyanka ??</comment>

<comment>Yes the same dumb woman!</comment>

<comment>She fumbles to put one sensible line together in English on debates.... Now , see the miracle..LOL</comment>

<comment>She might have taken help from some idiot. Congress is filled with 'em!</comment>

<comment>How has FP allowed a Congress politician to publish an article  without disclosing her identity...</comment>

<comment>Her identity is disclosed dude, right at the bottom, but FP is pretending to be neutral..by airing views of the opposition as well. Have you seen a pattern in the way articles are published in FP. In the morning there will be a Pro- Article, by evening you will have a Anti-article.</comment>

<comment>Yup... i missed it ...never bothered to read the article in its entirety...</comment>

I was afraid that one might slap another.   Then the debate was over.However, even after the debate was over, the camera rolled on for 20-30 seconds, without the sounds. And it showed one spokesperson, who was screaming, was actually praising other with big smile and patting others.It was another Peepli Live  !!!  Another drama.</comment>

When a bunch a hole s making slogans against on their own country and supporting a enemy and terrorist ...how do you support people like that ?! What about freedom of expression of the Jawan who killed ?!</comment>

<comment>India has very less chance of threat of destruction from any foreign body, but people like who born, brought up, educated, get job in this country and start anti-national activity are real threat.. and to my surprise there are huge number of such traitors.. Now the law should be there like China has.. shoot on sight whoever found doing anti-national activities..</comment>

<comment>I just changed my mind. To Bhakts. Wake up. If you are a BJP supporter you will be sold. Look at how Jats will get reservation by reservation thuggery. Jat leaders who caused widespread destruction, who are anti-national in deed are rewarded. From the looks of it BJP will go for private sector reservations. Vote for Kanhaiya Kumar the genius as PM. It is positively dangerous to support Modi. Surrender to Jat reservation policy shows India is a Ocholocracy [mob rule] where individual [smallest minority]rights are by definition murdered. Dont find fault with me - the problem is Constitution of India which allows it.When a person scores above 94% and another gets same seat for 49% in an EXAMINATION when the examiners dont know the examinees then merit does not exist because it has been murdered. A person who was murdered did exist. So also merit.That is the argument of relative morality of Mixed economy, a fascist economy - because measure and morals is a product of ones upbringing they dont exist. What is only moral is what the Constitution and mafia politicians laws state.Every government interference in the economy/society consists of giving an unearned benefit, extorted by force, to some men at the expense of others. By what criterion of justice is a consensus-government to be guided? By the size of the victim’s gang.If parasitism, favoritism, corruption, and greed for the unearned did not exist, a mixed economy would bring them into existence.Since there is no rational justification for the sacrifice of some men to others, there is no objective criterion by which such a sacrifice can be guided in practice. All “public interest” legislation (and any distribution of money taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others) comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined, undefinable, non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials and mafia politicians.The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used dishonestly, but that it cannot be used honestly.Why does not the state allot a seat strictly on merit and snatch it away OPENLY?Gandhian Socialism of BJP is Gandhiism [selling of ones supporters to gain support of Jinnah and Muslims and Socialism is legal robbery]</comment>

<comment>Better you should wake up and should know from where such evils came, like reservation, partitions of India, policies indirectly ensuring poverty in India to keep their chances for seat, political inheritance, etc.. better talk on topic by this webpage or face to face if you have courage.. I too dont support reservation, castism, or religion biasness.. or any social evil..</comment>

<comment>As Arun Shourie said BJP government is congress + Cow. He is following in ditto Congress divisive policies - and he has Huge support. I know it came from congress and left. But the problem is Modi given his huge support may use it to betray his supporters and go in for private sector reservations - which congress and left dare not do, without invoking great unrest.Can Kanhaiya Kumar as PM bring reservation in private sector? He will not be successful in doing it.</comment>

<comment>Do you know this Jat reservation promise was done by Congress government for vote bank while their government was about to be over and Supreme court denied that stating that reservation is for socially backward class not economically backward class as per the constitution.. and BJP did not deny at that time and now BJP is reaping what congress has sown at that time..I dont support any reservation except for poors..</comment>

<comment>Murder of merit  is murder, even done with excuse of poverty. I am for total scrapping of reservation policy in toto, and removal of socialism from constitution.Congress is a discredited force - and it will not be able to handle the back lash of introducing reservations in private sector.Can Kanhaiya Kumar as PM bring reservation in private sector? He will not be successful in doing it.</comment>

<comment>Then you should study from a private university and work in a private company, buy your food and groceries from private shops, give up LPG subsidy, Give up ration cards, give up using public transportation - buses, trains, trams, Locals etc, you should not walk on government laid roads, only use private motorways (if there is one). don't visit temples - as they are Government owned, shouldn't breath air - buy oxygen cylinders to breathe and use CO2 filters to recycle. No sewer, public water for you - you are free to purchase.You are so meritorious, you don't need them. You can invent all of them or pay for them on your own.</comment>

<comment>India has something to teach the world - how even an army and police can be private companies.  It is rule of East India Company. Great progress was achieved then. Progress of India crashed after the British Government captured power from East India CompanyThe British government seized power from East India Company blaming it for the Bengal Famine after crippling it by banning of textiles from India. Stories of Dacca Muslim weavers thumbs being cut[sounds eerily similar to Ekalayva story] is just unsubstantiated lies arising from anti-white racism and directed against private company rule (East India Company Rule), lies being unopposed by British Government. The size of Indian economy shrunk from around 28% to 3% by 1950 in world trade. Like all governments it was inefficient became bankrupt and committed suicide[lost an empire]</comment>

<comment>An open letter to Barkha Dutt: (A reply to her letter to Shri Narendra Modi ji),Dear Barkha Dutt,I read your passionate letter to the Prime Minister urging him to clear his stand in the ongoing JNU issue. I must say that you've expressed your anguish and a sense of disappointment very eloquently. As expected of course. But what the letter lacks is honesty and it is laced with hypocrisy that we have also unfortunately come to know you for. Please let me explain.You say that the Prime Minister has shunned you because you reported 2002.My understanding is that he shunned you, if he really has, is not because you reported 2002 but how you reported it. You and your colleagues now claim how journalism means putting facts on the table and then letting the audience decide which side to take. You accuse other channels of bias and hyper-nationalism. But at the same time you so conveniently forget how your esteemed channel went gung-ho and so blatantly blamed him of “giving an illegal order”. Remember? But when SIT categorically stated in its report that there was no such illegal orders, your channel did not issue an apology. You see this is the problem in him engaging with the likes of you. Journalists like you may be deeply hurt because the most prominent figure of Indian politics has “shunned” you but to someone like me, you absolutely 100% deserve this boycott, even if it were to be true. And my dear ma’am, this is just one example. I can give you a thousand others (remember Hanuman Mandir at Anjar or Mr. Vijay Trivedi’s lies?).Your channel has been hounding Mr. Modi for a long time, based on claims of people who've also been proven in court as liars. You did not provide facts then. You did not get angry when other channels also did not. You assumed. You implicated. And dare I say, defamed him for years on end. Why should he entertain you now when you’re doing just that all over again?You have assumed again that it was the Tweet of a fake handle that this entire enquiry is based upon. You are again turning a blind eye to the fact that an investigation is needed, given the gravity of the situation. If Kanhaiya Kumar is innocent, he will come out of this scot-free. But why should that mean he cannot be investigated? He has been seen with a person who may have links with SIMI, is absconding from the police at the moment and most importantly, Kanhaiya has been sent to judicial custody by a court of law. Why should you, as a responsible journalist, ignore these facts and direct all your anger towards him, again? Coming to the lawyers who have allegedly beaten up Kanhaiya and members of your fraternity, your anguish is based upon mere assumptions again. If photographs could be a proof of anything, Indira Gandhi seen with Nicolae Ceaușescu in 1969 should have rung alarm-bells for everybody as to what she was about to do in a few years from then. Did it? No. Because, pictures prove nothing. So please, if a lawyer is seen with Rajnath Singh, it doesn't mean Rajnath Singh approves of the lawyer’s behaviour. Please stop (directly or indirectly) implicating Modi & his government for actions of every Tom, Dick and Harry. It’s not just dumb but looks disastrous on seasoned journalists like you. Approach the court through proper channels and if found cognizable, the court will help find justice that your fraternity claims to deserve in this case.That brings me to the moot point of this letter – your hypocrisy. You speak so passionately in your letter about Rohith Vemula, Kanahiya Kumar and Dadri. But so conveniently forget Umar Khalid, Prashanth Poojary, Malda, fatwa for beheading Kamlesh Tiwari, rapes in West Bangal and gruesome murders taking place daily in Bihar and Kerala. If you paid attention, you’d notice that the Prime Minister hasn't spoken about them either. So tell me, what it is, if not hypocrisy on your part, to ask him about certain issues and ignore the rest? How do you expect your readers to react to this apparent discrimination?If  you want to be known as a journalist of integrity, someone devoid of bias and get ‘that interview’ you so seemingly desire, you ma’am, need to set your own house in order first. Unfortunately, at this moment, with all that I have explained above (and many others I left out), your honesty and journalistic integrity seem extremely questionable to us readers. Perhaps, that’s what makes Modi, the man, steer clear of the likes of you. Perhaps, he doesn't want to get into the mudslinging you've all been engaged in. Perhaps, he doesn't want to divert his mind from nation-building and tangle himself into your dark world of dishonesty and bias. And in my humble opinion, anybody with a head on his shoulders and a lot on his plate would do the same.Thanks & Best Regards,A despicable “Bhakt” who just bought “The Unquiet Land” (Source: Nakul Bharadwaj-Quora)</comment>

<comment>This is the woman who, whenever she appears in TV Panel discussions as Congress Spokes person, screams like a 'cat on hot tin roof' and never allows other panelists to speak. That is the tolerance she has been taught by her mentors, the Congress Goons, The crack down on the anti-National  students  in the JNU campus was the consequence of their seditious activities like calling the SC verdict on the terrorist Afzal Guru as "Judicial Killing" and inciting the mob who had gathered to celebrate Afzal's 'Martyrdom' to wage war against India until the state was destroyed. No responsible government can allow such traitorous activities on its soil and that is what Modi Government has done. How dare this mentally retarded Congress spokesperson call this a ploy by the Government to divert attention from paralysis of Governance? For a number of years the successive Congress governments had either closed their eyes or actively collaborated with the Left infested JNU's trecherous activities. As a result, to day JNU is virtually a Pakistani/Chinese enclave working towards dismembering our country. It is time this disgrace of an educational institution is closed down and all the 5th column students and faculty members fattening themselves at the cost of Tax Payers' money are rounded up. For all the money dumped on this institution by the Congress governments, it has not produced a single person of International eminence in any field but ranks first in subversive and secessionist activities.</comment>

<comment>what a idiotic article.. is it right to not stop or punish persons who raise slogans against India and pro-Pakistan and support terrorists? Why to blame BJP or any other when action is being taken against them? it is a big tragedy, people trying to destroy their mother land and so many people support them.. very shameful..</comment>

<comment>The idiot author wants borders open... for jihadis to destroy India..</comment>

<comment>yes you are right... Fekuji and team is destroying our nation and bhakts are supporting him.</comment>

<comment>JNU crackdown is a ploy by Pre$$titues & Liberals to divert attention from success of governance.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely.</comment>

<comment>Well  said..</comment>

<comment>Priyanka ... you talk against Modi and BJP but how can you support anti national activities... you must be supporting ISIS</comment>

<comment>Why stop there? say 26/11 or even 9/11 were ploys by BJP.</comment>

<comment>They already did that.</comment>

<comment>26/11 for sure</comment>

<comment>why not 9/11?</comment>

<comment>USA are not fools</comment>

<comment>Oh,I remember it  now.  US itself did 9/11 to attack middle east and take oil from it. right? I mean that's what all muslims say at least.</comment>

<comment>Oh...then only Indian are fool?</comment>

<comment>Coming from National Spokesperson of Congress what can we expect. She is daily ripped apart on SM.She is a master troller writing one crap to another. This report can be dismissed with the contempt it deserves.</comment>

<comment>Mostly partisan stuff from this writer.Although I reject BJP's actions in this controversy, I don't stand by the entirety of this article.No Govts have had a clear policy on Pakistan. And terrorist attacks have happened under all Govts. And none was handled properly. To attack the Govt. on all fronts, mainly because of this FoS issue is rather wrong.</comment>

<comment>when we choose a chaiwala over a economist we were bound to get this anyhow but then again my thoughts at least MMS was educated was not blaming others for his mistake he always said he will try to improve</comment>

<comment>MMS was not blaming others bcoz he was not authorized to open his mouth other than for eating by madam soniaji and rahul baba.Ya we choose chaiwala bcoz he was a able and proven adminstartor and most importantly he was selected by the people unlike MMS who was selected by madam soniaji and rahul baba.MMS always said he will try to improve on what account my friend coal Scam which he was minister for or 2G scam or common wealth games scam ,Chopper scam, Adarsh Scam.. ya for sure he could have improved the kickbacks soniaji and rahul baba got from these scams.</comment>

<comment>We cannot have a better PM than MMS as he is widely respected world wide and has real intellect. His compulsion of coalition politics had stifled him to a great extent. But now, even after having absolute majority we only have excuses after excuses. And the foolish bhakts still go on chanting....</comment>

<comment>MMS was following coalition dharma, Modi is following COW-alition dharma</comment>

<comment>True, the economist blamed global economy ss he flushed our economy down toilet.. we were marked lower than Chad in terms of economic health (154 out if 185), now we are at 107 and still raising.. yup MMS was better :) </comment>

<comment>Did you pick the data from thambcharitmanas? Because UNDP HDI report says India has remained within the ranks of 120-135 in the last 10 years, in 2015 it was at 130.</comment>

<comment>yes now dollar at 35 rs and dal at 2 RS blind bhakts can say anything</comment>

<comment>MMS was an able guy.. but Media malinged his image.</comment>

<comment>MMS was silent but Modi is feku.</comment>

<comment>What pity days on First Post....they are calling spokesperson of political parties to vomit on editorials</comment>

<comment>A student who shouted out to Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in Varanasi was beaten up allegedly by BJP activists.The student, Ashutosh Singh, had shouted about student body elections at BHU just as PM Modi was leaving the stage after finishing his address.He was grabbed by the police and then allegedly attacked by BJP workers.</comment>

<comment>Yes, In a university, he must be attacked by BJP workers and not by other students. Bcoz , you know, it is not JNU.</comment>

<comment>Allegedly</comment>

<comment>The question is, once the police took the student away, why was he allowed to fall in the hands of BJP party workers. It is not news in India, that party workers beat up anybody who shows dissent against their party leaders. The police should have been able to anticipate this, and should not have left him to his own devices.The fact is that the Indian police is so hard-wired now to bow to political will and pressure, that they have lost all spine. It will take years of reorientation for the Indian police to understand that they do not have to be so helpless in front of politicians and their cronies.</comment>

<comment>yes they wanted to show one more non governance? senseless article</comment>

<comment>what kind of website is this??? any nonsense person can write anything w/o moderation? thirdclass website due to such hopeless writers.</comment>

<comment>Actually it is the first sensible article I ve seen in ages. The BJP is all about Beef and Student slogans. While the country remains in poverty. Acche din!Heil Modi!</comment>

<comment>So karthik u thought BJP will come and suddenly take everyone out of the poverty?? Be realistic - we expected the govt to take the initiatives which will serve the larger group of nation which they have taken like make in India, start up india, swach bharat, digital india, jan dhan yojana, etc. The government has become more responsive to the ordinary citizen request or complaint thanks to twitter and other social media platforms which no other previous government did.  The scam less government most important which i wish they will continue to do.</comment>

<comment>No, I hoped that they would run the govt. on the platform that they campaigned for, after criminal mis-governance by the Congress for decades. And they have, to some extent.  Also this govt might be scam-less, unlike the previous govt. but they are also extremely divisive and focus on a lot of Wedge Issues which have never been particularly relevant. Modi needs to shed/shutter the RSS and work for the reason he was elected. If he is in fact the strong independent leader that he believes he is, maybe he can actually start showing that.</comment>

<comment>they have become very bad. I am avoiding FIRST POST articles for last few days. Sometimes just jump to their comment section to enjoy how they are being bashed by the general public</comment>

<comment>So what did you expect? You beat up one of their reporters only because he is a muslim, so obviously they will expose you.</comment>

<comment>WTF are you saying..can you be a bit clear plz</comment>

<comment>Search for Tariq Anwar, firstpost reporter, beaten by Rajnath's accomplice, BJP rowdy and lawyer, Vikram Chauhan.</comment>

<comment>Hahaha..Just u have seen Vikram chauhan pic with Rajnath u assumed he his accomplice. Grt!. Vikram chauhan himself said he has his photo with many other politicians including Congress and other political parties. Though i never support any physical attack however will expect each and every one respect my country instead of supporting anit nationals that's what congress and AAP have done. they can't visit a brave soldier how was fighting for his life and were seen racing to sympathise these students. Praveen one more advise stop seeing people based on their caste (pls see ur earlier post).  Grow Up!</comment>

<comment>blah blah... i don't care what party preferences you are talking of but I was mentioning why firstpost has started losing faith in the government. The guy was beaten up solely because of his religion, why keep eyes closed to it.</comment>

<comment>1) I will explain how big moron u r....U are saying he was beaten because he was muslim so he was only muslim standing in crowd of 1000s and the lawyers were hunting for muslims....Idiot2) U say u dont care of party preferences and u started your reply by abusing BJP based on ur half minded perception what an irony.3) And instead of openly blaming BJP and misleading the people by writing such biased articles,  u can go to the court and file a case against BJP if u think so for attacking the Journalist. Dont keep your eyes close but dont shut ur  brain also.4) Ur one of those SICKULAR how will uses religion card for his own benefit</comment>

<comment>faking news articles are posted here also by firstpost :)</comment>

<comment>whats wrong she said? They did not respect flag for 52 years? Now they telling nationalism to others. Wow!! Ask  Amit shah about this? where was his nationalism then?</comment>

<comment>bjp wasnt existed 52 years before..but congress was. all your gandhis destroyed india and now u blame bjp.</comment>

<comment>Congress was in power then This is the India (Of course It could have been better). But If It would have been BJP then India would have been destroyed much earlier. Some of the aspect you may know about BJP.They are not liberal et al.No women liberties.Extreme religious or radicalism.Compare everything with pakistan? I dont know why? and converting India to PakistanAlways there to fight, on the name of Ram. If they are true believer of Ram then they should preach the peace and make the people feel how good is that. But that is difficult task.Talk about hindu hindu but never let the caste system vanish.Want an India of 1500 century.And Just tell me what vision they have for India?? I have always voted for them, but now they are nowhere. I guess I will never vote for them in my life again unless a person like Atal ji is there.</comment>

<comment>Are u an Idiot? Bharatiya Jansangh was formed by Hindu Mahasabha leader Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in 1950 after the Gandhi killing. In 1977 it merged with Janata Party and revived as BJP 30 years back. Even before that Hindu Mahasabha was formed in 1906 and RSS is there as the big boss of all of them since 1925. It was Sardar Patel who, in 1950, compelled them to accept the Tri-colour as National Flag of India as a pre-condition for lifting ban on RSS. Even after that National Flag was never flown at RSS Nagpur HQ till a decade ago...</comment>

<comment>Makes no fkn difference. RSS had ideological differences over the design of the flag and so kept away from the Tiranga to voice their opinion. It took time for the older generation to pass on the baton to the younger ones who have now fully accepted it. Which flag they respect has no bearing on how patriotic and devoted they are to this country. Even I don't like the flag of India, it doesn't have any of our historical elements. That charkha or chakra in the middle is fkn useless as well.</comment>

<comment>The difference was not on design, but on the fundamental concept of Indian Nation... A secular democratic nation as defined by our constitution vs. a theocratic, Manuvadi and Brahminic "Hindu Rashtra"...</comment>

<comment>You conveniently changed the topic from flag to the constitution now.</comment>

<comment>Who destroyed India.. India before 52years was nothing..</comment>

<comment>Shame to all the professors who support anti national slogans while sakshi maharaj is doing shows they r not professors any more.... you forget your duty while showing some body who is not....no place for politicians in the form of professors...Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code reads: “Whoever, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Government established by law in India, shall be punished with imprisonment for life…”.</comment>

<comment>Modi govt is only govt in my India which is functioning..if you call this paralysys, what will you call 60 years of congress govts? Other than Narsimha Rao, no other Cong govt really worked. BTW, it is expected of INC to take side of anti nationals. A party which is dependent on foreign national, cannot be loyal to my country!</comment>

<comment>well ur right,India is my mother and any tom,dick r harry can talk useless about my mother and thats freedom of speech and if i say some thing like proposing any one for second marriage my character dhila hein,well shame on u if u support this anti national and yes if u support freedom of speech u shall allow me to propose even ur sister for a date,well it shall be full freedom no this is allowed and this is not,and for ur information in india muslims r allowed for 4 marriages,well i am not a muslim but i demand to allow me to marry 4 girls and if any one opposes i will shout they r threatening my right to speech and right to marry and all this that</comment>

<comment>where I supported any anti-national? Two people from my family are in armed forces. But I know you assumed everything, because you mind cant go beyond that. Whatever you have written that is shit which is in you mind. You said marry 4 girls, then why dont you convert yourself to such person. If you want to do everything watching what they do, or what Pakistan or soudi does, better you go there and do whatever. Let India be in peace. And again a suggestion If you have an sensible brain then learn to respect. Whatever you said about other's sister, that shows how unfortunate the girls or women who lives close to you.</comment>

<comment>well i dont wish to marry 4 girls,nor wished to say about ur sister any thing as if u love ur nation ur sister is like my sister,but yes if any one speak about my mother land i cant tolerate it and so may be told some thing which i should not,sorry for it,well seeing again India going on the dreaded path by which it shall break again feeling very hurt,sorry again as i never wish to hurt any person who loves their mother land</comment>

<comment>She is not a Gandhi but she is a member of the Congress party. Google her name.</comment>

<comment>The Gandhi surname came from Feroze Gandhi, who was not related to Mahatma Gandhi. Indira Priyadarshini Nehru (the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru) married Feroze Gandhi in 1942 and adopted his surname.[4]</comment>

<comment>The name was Feroze Ghandy. He was a muslim but later adopted by the father of our nation (I have no respect for this man) and got the surname Gandhi. I know their entire history.</comment>

<comment>Anyone from INC and supporting INC, inherits last name as Gandhi. Not M Gandhi..Khangress Italian Gandhi.</comment>

<comment>People who could not tollerate the work being done by Modi Govt , are rattled and creating nuisense with help of forieng fund</comment>

<comment>more than 70% of Indians r below Poverty Line in may 2014 & more than 70 % Indians r below Poverty line after 20 months rule of your so called Modi Govt.i think u see the difference</comment>

<comment>which report?, it takes time to bring down poverty, many schemes and policies  are declared, now it takes some time to reach to the needy</comment>

<comment>Yes i do see the difference of not letting poverty rate increase which your khangress masters did increase intolerably high</comment>

<comment>As if poverty is creation of Modi govt! Remember your forefathers in INC came up with slogan with garibi hatao? If your govt so efficient, no one in India would have been poor..stop blaming Modi for your sins..</comment>

<comment>Click on Priyanka Chaturvedi name above and you will see all her articles. Yes 100% agree with the comments below "So now FP has started hiring members from the congress party to write articles for them".Shame on FP. Be honest with your job.</comment>

<comment>Endless presstitution !!!!!!!!! There seems to be no end to it !!!</comment>

<comment>Modi has been a total disappointment even with a majority.</comment>

<comment>Please can you explain why?</comment>

<comment>Going soft on Pakistan. No justice for Saurav Kalia, Rupin Katyal.No Bangaldeshi pigs removed from Assam and West Bengal.No sympathy for Hindu riot victims.</comment>

<comment>I only wonder what would have any other Government done had that hijack at their time.I agree to your points & understand your point on movement of Illegal migrants, can't we give some time to action just like have given for Congress. Even if he is with Majority, the Indian Constitution & Legislative setup is such that it makes sure that even someone with Majority, hits with Paralysis. Look at the wipe-outs of the previous Parliament sessions.Would like to request people on Twitter & other Social Medias to start a campaign to make sure that parliament session is not suspended not even a single minute. Let the opposition keep shouting in the bay & let entire country see how they are blocking the proceedings & how is Govt is responding (right or wrong). Can you support on this please?</comment>

<comment>lolzz... So now FP has started hiring members from the congress party to write articles for them. Seems like unemployment is rising in the congress party. BTW Priyanka Chaturvedi is damn hot. Hope she reads these comments.</comment>

<comment>Shut up, you bloody Con-gress lickers.....we know how con-gress looted this country...</comment>

<comment>I agree, the RSS/BJP will make India great again. We should make Modi the Fuhrer and then he will surely solve all our problems. We can make a Gulag where all these undesirables can be sent away and the Indian glory will be restored again! If it all started with doctored video of a student, so what? It is all for the Greater Good!Heil Modi!</comment>
