<comment>If she is not "after power" let her call fresh elections. </comment>

<comment>Looks like the Italian lady has offered her some nice things:)) </comment>

<comment> She is not after power?Give me  break! She is after full power, that is why she is weighing her options ,,to get the best deal.</comment>

<comment>like the abdullahs all that matters for the muftis is to grab the throne of kashmir and for this the shameless late father and daughter are well known for comprising anything including sucking upto anti nationals which we have seen time and again</comment>

<comment>Translation, she's not interested in meeting fate of Razia (selected by her father Iltutmish over her cent-percent waste-candidate stepbrothers, one of whom was foisted anyway by "the 40" before Razia tookover after his incompetence couldn't be hidden -- and another of whom tookover five years later after 39 of "the 40" used her absence from the capital to put another of the wasters on the throne), so waits till she can get a proxy as party-leader (and CM).</comment>

<comment>You join politics to come to power and govern. Remember, there is a state to be rules and you better hurry.</comment>

<comment>I doubt there is a truth in this statement "she is not behind power" ........... she is definitely behind power and why??? BJP-PDP is an alliance only to deliver CMP to state citizens. They are poles apart and it is a big compromise is for both the parties. If they wish to stay away from the power it means they wish to be away from CMP.</comment>

<comment>she is trying to make use of her father's demise, wants fresh election</comment>

<comment>Now that PM has announced package for Kashmir, PDP should form new government with NC.</comment>

<comment>Till Last week PDP was patriotic for Bhakths..Suddenly now its changed</comment>

<comment>She is just doing drama. If she is not after power, then let someone become CM. The state needs a CM, what is that they are waiting for?</comment>

<comment>BY associating with PDP, BJP is forced to be anti-national sometimes, in fact many times, even if it meant that Pak/IS flags were hoisted, India's tricolor was insulted and Pak's incursions were tolerated.</comment>

<comment>Jammu completely backed the BJP. I believe there is one Hindu MLA who is not in the BJP. If a PDP government with the NC and Congress consisting completely of Kashmiri Muslims had come to fruition, the state would have ripped apart. It still might rip apart, but any formation without the BJP would have caused major chaos in the state. In the end I believe it is in the best interest of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakj to separate. And I hope the GOI pushes for this</comment>

<comment>"Forced" to be anti-national.......LOL</comment>

<comment>May be you have a point there ....</comment>

<comment>Whether she is after power or not is of least interest. GOI and BJP must control the anti national stances in the valley which is now likely to become more bold. Administration in the valley must understand talks of two flags and things of that nature are suicidal. Judiciary must stay out of such controversial issues.</comment>

<comment>f mehbooba forms a secular govt with the help of Congress, NC and independent, then i think BJP will never form any coalition govt in J&K in future and bjp will be wiped out in valley and also in Jammu is fresh elections are held now and in future.A very good and positive decision by mehbooba for the betterment of J&K and to throw BJP from the power as soon as possible. BJP dream of his leader becoming a CM of valley state will be doomed for everha ha ha ha ah</comment>

<comment>So as per your view, Kaashmir has been a jannat for past 2 decades till BJP made some electoral gains. All the mess in Kashmir has been done by Congress since 47 and blind fans want it to come back again. It will be loss for People there.</comment>

<comment>yes brilliant if BJP is wiped out and desh drohis are given full powers ....then we can hoist the green crescent from the Red Fort .....Never knew the country has spawned so many seditionists....</comment>

<comment>If mehbooba forms a secular govt with the help of Congress, NC and independent, then i think BJP will never form any coalition govt in J&K in future and bjp will be wiped out in valley and also in Jammu is fresh elections are held now and in future.A very good and positive decision by mehbooba for the betterment of J&K and to throw BJP from the power as soon as possible. BJP dream of his leader becoming a CM of valley state will be doomed for everha ha ha ha ah</comment>

<comment>she wants to take congress support and also BJP in the coalition and keep BJP not to make any fresh demands.</comment>

<comment>mehbooba has made her mind to tie up with Congess and NC and form a secular govt and ditch BJP,w hich is a communal party and asking form the rotational CM post, Home minister post and other plump minisers posts.and i am sure PDP+NC+Congress_Independent parties will run the govt to its full termhats off to mehbooba</comment>

<comment>extreme secularism is always dangerous.</comment>

<comment>i came to know today from you that there are also kinds of secularismfrom where did you get this word extreme secularism ha ha ha hai know only word secularism which is in oxford dictionaryha ha ahhai think it will be good for J&K to have a secular Govt, BJP in the govt is creating a number of obstacles for smooth running of govt affairs and mehbooba is going in right direction of ditching bjp and forming a most viable and secular option govtha ha ha ha</comment>

<comment>Mehbuba needs more time to bargain a good deal with either the congress or BJP before taking a plunge. But why tell the public that she is not after power? Publiko bewquoof samjstha hai ?</comment>

<comment>May be, the PDP is belatedly realizing that the unnatural and unholy coalition with the BJP have badly ruptured their credibility amongst the Kashmiris which was seen as the mother of unprincipled opportunism and unscrupulous politics or it may be just a case of political brinkmanship and bargaining to cut the shameless BJPee to size riding on its desperation to somehow attain power by hook or crook !!Whatever said and done, Mehbooba is showing the World as to what an astute, scheming and vily Politician that she is and there is nothing in this drama except for  the shameless hankering of Politicians to taste the loaves of Office and its associated power and pelf !!</comment>

<comment>Am not sure if this is a possibility, not an expert.. She can put new conditions, refuse to form government, call for early elections, ride the sympathy wave and get a majority.?</comment>

<comment>Contrary she is more Power hungry. It is deliberation to get better deal.</comment>

<comment>She is more porki than the porki itself. She will lay new conditions to BJP and may get into a deal with congress for government formation. Such a Govt will be unstable and risky, and will further alienate Jammu and Ladakh region completely. She thinks only Muslims will decide the fate of J&K and none else. She wants to bring in sharia law in J&K.</comment>

<comment>And AMit Shah "The P1mp" will agree to it as they are just hungry for seats...isnt it??</comment>

<comment>President rule should be imposed since Mehbooba has some secret plan in her mind. BJP should not bow before PDP so far CM post is concerned. No preconditions of PDP should be accepted in any circumstances. Let us wait & watch concealed agenda of PDP. There was spurt of violence during last regime which should be checked.</comment>

<comment>she  has made her mind to tie up with Congess and NC and form a secular govt and ditch BJP,w hich is a communal party and asking form the rotational CM post, Home minister post and other plump minisers posts.and i am sure PDP+NC+Congress_Independent parties will run the govt to its full termhats off to mehbooba</comment>

<comment>Give it to the Army...all the P0rki flag waving c0wards will disappear in a minute.</comment>

<comment>The Governor's rule is only solution to cool down the egos of Mehbooba.</comment>
