<comment>if there's any politician in the world with whom I want to disagree it's David Owen.Truly dreadful, stupid, vain man.Vote REMAIN</comment>

<comment>There IS no convincing argument for staying in the EU, get out now while we can, we will never get another chance before it breaks up in a very messy fashion.</comment>

<comment>What do we want? Everything to stay the same! When do we want it? For ever. </comment>

<comment>Another one trying to insult us by insisting it is all about personalities, it is not. This issue is much bigger than any politician.We cannot control our borders, we cannot control EU immigration numbers. This will effect our housing, schools and hospitals and that is fact.EU law is supreme over UK law and we have to vote to leave the EU to have any hope of stopping the car crash ahead.I do hope the British people realise this, plainly much of the UK's Political class are in complete EU denial.</comment>

<comment>Seriously? Of course Boris knows the names of the campaigns.It's 50% 'fake man of the people', pretending not to be a nerd and 50% 'Before me..... Nothing!'I find it interesting that disgraced individuals in politics are always forgiven by the media at the first opportunity. I don't understand it. Is it because they know where the secrets are buried?</comment>

<comment> 1down 35 to go</comment>

<comment>Theresa May - "loyalty and motive" - really? Loyalty to TM and the incumbent leader, perhaps; loyalty to the principles of her party - never. Motive - to be annointed Leader through being a woman. Perhaps we should also address the competence of this veritable Titan. How has she presided over massive failures on the part of extradition proceedings, massive failures to even record let alone secure our borders yet still kept office? Because she is just the epitome of Cameron's populist box ticking cabinet.</comment>

<comment>Theresa has assessed the situation career wise and realised she either does not want the top job, or has not got what it takes to get it. Therefore go for the long, steady career at the top table. Straw was a classic proponent of this. He did a lot of damage without seemingly having to answer for anything.</comment>

<comment>In my view Cameron has been charged with the task of keeping Britain in the EU by the world's corporate elites, Cameron's cosy cartel. Their ambition is clearly to gain power within the European Parliament, by creating lobbying and pressure groups in order to influence major decisions in favour of big business. He is from a wealthy background, and I think he is disingenuous when it comes to doing the best thing for his country. I do not believe he is campaigning for the benefit of the UK, and somewhere along the line there will be a handsome reward for him.But If ever there was an 'acid test' for the calibre of the man as a potential heavyweight politician, it was the recent EU renegotiations. However, most would agree it finally exposed Cameron as weak and subservient. He lacked conviction and clout, and the superficial concessions he did gain, or to put it another way, was offered, might well be revoked in due course.Leaving the EU is unequivocally the right decision for our country, and those more sincere politicians such as Boris Johnson and Micael Gove, listened to the electorate and their conscience. A vote to leave will restore Britain's power to renegotiate with Europe on OUR terms, from a blank canvas and a renewed position of strength. Voting to remain, under the current circumstances will be one of the biggest mistakes this country has ever made.</comment>

<comment>I would agree. I would also suggest that Cameron was not necessarily just weak and subservient but may have been playing his own game. When he taunted Johnson with his political ambitions, it might have been interesting if the riposte had been to ask him to rule out that he had any EU ambitions.</comment>

<comment>"Mr Cameron must resist slapping down Boris and concentrate, instead, on making   a convincing case for Britain to stay in Europ"May be it is because David 'Con-ner'-man knows that he does not have a "convincing case" ?</comment>

<comment>Dave is such a massive pill..Ock.</comment>

<comment>The reason that he attacks Boris, insteadof making a convincing case to stay in the EU is that there is no convincingcase for him to make.It is just bullying tactics and scare mongering. We all see through him and let’s hope that the masses don’t believe a word he or his crones have to say.</comment>

<comment>Prediction for later in 2016 -Trump will win!!!!Boris and CMD will make more Eton Mess.Brexet won't win because -- Deutsche Boerse & London Stock Exchange have to merge so Merks won't let usHinkley Point - again merge French EDF so they won't let usGreece fed up so they won't eitheretc.etc. it's all about money - nothing else.</comment>

<comment>Always a mistake to have that second glass of sherry…</comment>

<comment>To judge from all the vitriol towards "big business", it seem the Brexit camps are now taking their main lead from George Galloway.</comment>

<comment>Future economic growth will be delivered by small businesses, not the lazy sprawling things that dominate the CBI.</comment>

<comment>Big business is behind support for the EU and thus deserves vitriol.</comment>

<comment>A "towering figure" by all accounts...</comment>

<comment>The Witney Plonker is getting plenty of advice from his fellow Bullingdon Club thugs,banking crooks, corporate welfare queens, tax evaders, subsidy junkies and other dregs of society.The last thing he needs is advice from a Murdoch jailbird.</comment>

<comment>Viktor Orban, the Hungarian PM, is today boasting that notwithstanding Dave's 'renegotiation' Hungarians in Britain can still get something for nothing:“the real debate was about there being benefits which workers do not pay for, but for which they are nonetheless eligible. The question was what should happen with benefits paid to third-country nationals, for which no contributions are paid in Britain. Here, too, we have succeeded in ensuring that these social benefits cannot be taken away… This means that we have even succeeded in protecting benefits which people working in the United Kingdom did not pay for in the form of contributions.”</comment>

<comment>Of more interest is Orban’s threatened referendum on whether Hungary should accept the re-distribution of migrants against its will.  Seems to be causing some consternation in Brussels…</comment>

<comment>Personally, I think it would be fairer if the home country paid the benefits in the host country.</comment>

<comment>Cameron was absolutely right to cut Boris off at the knees on Monday.   He is an undeniably charming fellow, who could win votes for Leave were he to have any credibility.  What Cameron did was remove that credibility by:1.       Savaging his wishy-washy half-in, half-out stance2.       Reminding everyone that his true objective is personal aggrandisementThe sight of an unkempt, porky, arm-flapping  BoJo struggling to rebut either suggestion, whilst enduring further public ridicule at the hands of fellow Conservatives behind him will live long in the memory.</comment>

<comment>And Cameron's true objective is NOT personal aggrandisement?</comment>

<comment>No.  He bats for Britain!</comment>

<comment>It was a case of Flashman redux. Dave can't hide his bully-boy nature for long when thwarted.It would have been a lot better for BoJo's future to have supported Remain and be in line for the PM's job when DC leaves. Osborne is a weirdo who is disliked by Tory MPs and the public.; BJ would easily beat him in a leadership contest.</comment>

<comment>No he is more in line for the job because he voted out.</comment>

<comment>Ah well – looks like we’re going to get Theresa May then…</comment>

<comment>Er no because she sided with Cameron.</comment>

<comment>So after he has won the referendum what happens next?</comment>

<comment>My predictions - stuff could happen immediately, or after everyone allows Cameron to finish his term as PM without resigning, to look unified again as some kind of 'party make up' gesture. Then, whatever the time frame, gloves come off, party faithful votes for new leader and May definitely doesn't do well, while Gove does rather better. Contest main contenders could be Gove v Osbourne v Boris.</comment>

<comment>But the psychology changes dramatically if Britain votes to remain.  Who wants to back a loser?</comment>

<comment>And with that comment, any credibility of thoughtful insight goes out the window. Teresa May is heading for No 1 spot on the constituency's "never to be considered trustworthy" list.</comment>

<comment>What superficial analysis. You must be a fan of Cameron's slick window dressing.</comment>

<comment>Both are wasters.</comment>

<comment>As Merkel unilaterally encouraged migrants into the EU (and we are now seeing the consequences), what does Cameron's 'deal' mean? Her autocratic approach to the democratic mirage that is the EU, means any deal is undermined at her whim.</comment>

<comment>Dave loves submitting to Mutti. She reminds him of his nanny.</comment>

<comment>One supposes that, first and foremost, BoJo is out for himself - Gove is out for the facts - and unlike the former, his objections to Dave's *renegotiation* are based on the outcome of those sessions being a meaningless farrago backed by no legislative body, whether at Member or EU level.</comment>

<comment>Here's a good maths question can you solve it.One of the big questions arising from today’s immigration statistics is how there can be 260,000 immigrants from the European Union (EU) over the past year yet around 650,000 National Insurance Numbers (NINos) handed to EU citizens.</comment>

<comment>Good point for the Home Secretary to answer - but then of course she has made sure that there are no proper records of anything.</comment>
