<comment>The real issue is that the basic concept of the EU of a united Europe and a free trade agreement has become almost another layer of government. Regardless of whether the UK is in or not is unlikely the free trade agreement will change. The issue is really the EU's inability to reform and the rush to add poorer eastern European states. This has at least partially caused the rise of Eurosceptism in most EU countries.The issue with freedom of movement is that for it work well there broadly needs to be a similar number of people migrating and immigrating from those two countries, this disparity is clear for pre and after 2004 countries. For example in 2010 there where 397k GB people in Ireland and 422k Irish people in UK, 172k GB people in France and 152K French people in the UK. The difference between these two pre 2004 membership countries is broadly equal. However for Poland 3k of GB people live in Poland but 521k Polish people live in the UK. That is a material difference and means a large net immigration rate for the UK. If the freedom of movement was restricted to two zones pre 2004 and after 2004 it would more or less cut out any immigration from the EU. Then for after 2004 EU countries a visa system based on English competency and a job offer or skills/experience in an area with shortage, preferential treatment could be given to them over non - EU countries. Having that system would benefit most of the EU because it prevents benefit claimants from eastern European countries moving to wealthier western Europe for a higher benefit amount and it ensures that eastern Europe retains more of its workers.If the EU cannot sort out issues such as this why should the UK put up with the burden of building 100,000 of houses (or a property bubble partially fueled by an unplanned increase in the population) and funding infrastructure, paying benefits to those who have not contributed to the system at a much larger cost than what they would get in their own country?Yes the UK can do more to limit immigration from non- EU countries but then this can be prohibited because of EU human right legislation.The fact is, is that the EU system is been abused and no mitigation strategy or reform is in place to deal with it and discontent rises. The level of arrogance is quite unacceptable from most EU leaders.</comment>

<comment>In the UK we are seeing an ever increasing number of migrants/illegals, refugees coming to the UK. The numbers are increasing fast each month. The reality is most are economic migrants  and many have a reasonable life and income back home but come to the UK to milk our very generous non contributory benefits system. They no how to maximise the benefits they get and how to get  social housing</comment>

<comment>People who have "a reasonable life and income back home " choose to move to the UK and live on benefits which the UK population claims keep them in poverty?</comment>

<comment>The Establishment is far too corrupt to leave us a free hand in a referendum. </comment>

<comment>There is no way the UK will be allowed to vote to leave the EU. No way. </comment>

<comment>I would love a leave vote but I fear it won't happen and it'll be left to people with means to leave the UK behind and find a better life.Everyone else will be left to suck it up.... It's quite simply Leave or Bust !</comment>

<comment>The EU have always said it is about ever closer union.. but their message is drowned out by our government & state broadcaster..Heath could have told the truth back in 1970.. and 25 years after the war he could have won a vote being honest... heath however chose to lie and government has been lying ever since</comment>

<comment>Heath signed us up. We, the 'bovine', in those days, didn't have a clue what 'we' were being signed-up to. 'Ever Closer Union' was a founding principle of what we were joining, but it was never publicised...'don't bother them, old boy'.Either our political class, and Civil Service (all the top ones with 'Firsts', of course) didn't read what they signed 'us' up to - therefore, idiots - or they were out and out liars with their advice and presentation of what signing up would mean for membership from the dynamic of 'Ever Closer Union?My position is to be in the EU, but with the acid feel about being in the EU from what seems a majority of opinion in the UK, I'd be glad to leave and see how we get on...without any more blaming and excuses.</comment>

<comment>"The sooner we are free from the Brussels tyrants the better"Well, if that comes to pass, lets see how it pans out.As I said, I'm for being in the EU, but if your view is the majority view after Dave's referendum, I'm all for leaving.Somehow, though, if the majority vote, by a slim majority, opts to stay in, I don't think that the people that want out of the EU will ever accept membership, and will carry on blaming, accusing etc., etc., for all our ills.Might be best to let the 'Outs' view go ahead and show what the UK can do outside of the EU, for 20 years, or so, to see who was right?</comment>

<comment>"Might be best to let the 'Outs' view go ahead and show what the UK can do outside of the EU, for 20 years, or so, to see who was right?"Absolutely irrational.If it turns out to be much worse, there would be no way back into the EU.You should be considering that the referendum majority should be a special majority, not just possibly the smallest possible margin - as it is in Australia, for example.With a small margin, it would end up like the Scottish referendum issue, where the SNP will forever be wanting to re-challenge.</comment>

<comment>"If it turns out to be much worse, there would be no way back into the EU."Of course there would be a way back in...but on terms that might prove too humiliating to accept with regards to the City: absolute precedence of EU directives over Parliament's laws;...same for the ECHR; and not a peep of moaning that everything is the EU's fault when our politicians, left and right, have finally had their delusional bubbles burst i.e. that we are still a major player on the world stage, circa 1845-1945.</comment>

<comment>A way back in? After walking out, insulting all the European organisations, their politicians, the EU member states' politicians?You must be dreaming!You seem not to have realised that the world has moved on in a big way.China, India, Australia and the USA have all said they want the UK to remain in the EU - none of them wants to go through a new, separate free-trade agreement with the UK.</comment>

<comment>Not sure you read my reply before 'shooting-off''Dreaming'? When I think a lot of our political class still thinks in terms of Britain's global role, as though we still had an empire...? The great institutions of our state do, The Armed forces, The Civil Service, The Monarchy..."China, India, Australia and the USA have all said they want the UK to remain in the EU - none of them wants to go through a new, separate free-trade agreement with the UK."I know all this, that is why I'm in favour of staying in the EU.Politics is the 'art-of-the-possible'. There would always be a way back, but on very, very humiliating terms.</comment>

<comment>"When I think a lot of our political class still thinks in terms of Britain's global role, as though we still had an empire...? The great institutions of our state do, The Armed forces, The Civil Service, The Monarchy..."*You* think that, for some strange reason. Those groups do not.That is just your mistaken, uninformed view.Whilst you think there is a way back, if the terms were so humiliating, then it wouldn't happen. Hence, there would be no way back. QED</comment>

<comment>If our economy was in such dire straights after leaving the EU that we couldn't go it alone, then of course our politicians WILL look for alternatives. If the only alternative was to eat gargantuan helpings of humble pie to get back into the EU, I think they would.and dress the decision up as a 'Triumph for Great Britain', and themselves, of course.So far you've characterised me as 'absolutely irrational', 'must be dreaming' and 'uninformed'.We're just exchanging views here. Relax, no need for personal insults.It's been interesting getting your viewpoint.</comment>

<comment>I am so proud of the Danes. A little nation of 5 million people who will not be bullied by the EUssr.They tried to scare all the Danes to vote yes we were told if they didn't they would not be a part of Europol and that would mean we would have no protection against terrorists and they mentioned pædophiles etcBut still 53.1% voted Nej Tak (No thank you).</comment>

<comment>We done Denmark</comment>

<comment>The Danes had to vote again after the 1992 vote. The extent of EEC dirty tricks and bullying was on an epic scale. 47 out of 48 newspapers backed the EEC side, only the Communist Party newspaper was against. Major companies were got at. Employees were threatened. TV journalists were got at. Not surprisingly Danes reversed their vote. Hopefully all that is remembered today and the Danes will not vote again. It is yet another warning to us as we face a possible referendum of what the EU is capable.</comment>

<comment>I was at a Danish company dinner in Denmark on Thursday, they were all very charming and friendly people and both views were represented at the table. What became obvious from the pro-EU view was how thoroughly brainewashed by their media the people have become, and from the opposing view, how naieve people are in the face of such a corrupt entity as the EU in believeing that their 'no' vote will actually change anything...Reminded me of dear old Blightty.</comment>

<comment>Enrol yourself on a spelling and grammar course in the English language.</comment>

<comment>So you are not brain washed??LOL!</comment>

<comment>Interesting, thank you.</comment>

<comment>I live in Denmark and do not agree with Vandieman. All my staff and friends I know voted No. They were well informed of both sides of the arguement and formed their own opinions. Danes are incredibly well versed in the art of politics they will not be bullied and have a distrust of politicians. They also know when the msm is lying to them.The media campaign was one of scare tactics. We were told we would be unprotected against terrorism and paedo's etc.if we voted Nej Tak (no thanks) and even after the recent Paris incident the Danes still voted no.Just look how the EU destroys countries. The Danes dislike for Federalism is huge even in the young and many have not forgotten the invasion from Germany in the 2nd world war.I am proud to live here with a proud people who still have their own culture..</comment>

<comment>Speaking of paedophiles, the EU behaved like a creepy man in a windowless van driving by Denmark offering some candy to the voters.  They rightly said "No!" and ran off.</comment>

<comment>Despite ll that rhetoric from you almost 50% of the Danish voters for the proposal.Hardly an overwhelming nej.</comment>

<comment>Respect to you Sir, mine was but a snapshot, I live in hope that Denmark will continue to resist.</comment>

<comment>TY Vandieman. Hope you enjoyed your meetings with the Danes. I certainly do not say there is no naivity or brainwashing that happens in all cultures and I take your point.Be careful of snaps and jægermeister they can change a conversation or two over a dinner meeting.

<comment>Cameron doesn't want Britain out  because his mates in Big Business have told him it would be a disaster for trade.  Rubbish, Britain sells very little to Europe . I keep saying this but a few minutes ago on sky news  it was pointed out that the Coastline of Britain is so unprotected that Britain could be invaded by Jihadists any night after dark. Apparently there are only a few coast guards patrolling part of the area whille Britain has an enormous coastline .I don't know how much the Home Office is allowed , but securing our Borders should be paramount, May really is not equipped for the job , Border Control "lost" thousands who were allowed to stay  in Britain while their application was assessed, 36, 000 disappeared.!!!! I could do better...LOL</comment>

<comment>"a few minutes ago on sky news it was pointed out that the Coastline of Britain is so unprotected that Britain could be invaded by Jihadists any night after dark. Apparently there are only a few coast guards patrolling part of the area whille Britain has an enormous coastline "Yep. Absolutely right. But who was it got rid of Maritime Patrol aircraft and cut the numbers of Customs Officers?However, what you have forgotten is that the Paris murderers, like the 7/7 bombers, were locals. They were already there and no amount of border controls would have made the slightest difference.What does make a difference though, is the seamless sharing of security and intelligence material. In that regard, the EU makes us safer, not more vulnerable.</comment>

<comment>The UK is no safer than France.Those who believe by leaving the EU it will become more safe are deluded at best but if they are politicians vying for power they are actually criminal.</comment>

<comment>If we had better intelligence the Paris Murders would not have happened , similarly the Russianskilled by the Aeroplane being bombed. Sad to say , I think there are some Jihadists in the U.K. already who came via Calais, this is when we need to be vigilant.</comment>

<comment>They didn't "already come in" to Paris, they were already in Paris, they were French citizens.Likewise the biggest threat to Britain is from home-grown terrorists, not people coming in as refugees and such.</comment>

<comment>Hi northwing, it says much then for our Intelligence Agencies that they are not fit for purpose . I agree that the Migrants in Calais rode rings around Britain and France , one lad was telling anyone who would listen that he had a letter from Huddersfield . Had the Police or Army worked from the French side of the Tunnel at the time, they could have detained several until they were  vetted , you would have thought France and Britain could have worked together  at the time.</comment>

<comment>Hi northwing, I didn't know it was French Citizens ???  When the young migrants in Calais acted like hooligans , broke into Containers etc there was a comment that a UK Number Plate was used to take those who could pay across the Border .The Calais problem was discussed every day....then all of  sudden .......nothing !!! It would be naive to think there are no jihadists in Britain , one in a Tube Station yelling "that's for Syria " could be a jihadist or simply  a Syrian , but it is time for the Government to wake up and MI5 to start investigating before we have   an invasion as France did.</comment>

<comment>The Russians have done their own airplane bombing but they are not showing any intention to admit that evil deed.</comment>

<comment>Hi Brabander  I have no time for Putin , he invaded Ukraine , took over Crimea , a force to be reckoned with . He does nothing for nothing so why go to the aid of Assad?</comment>

<comment>So the PM's security policy is going swimmingly ?</comment>

<comment>I dunno northwing , give us a clue.Not Theresa May surely??</comment>

<comment>They don't even share Passenger Information Lists for flights within Europe. Belgium don't tell France that a known Jihadi is on his way to Paris. France doesn't tell us when he lands in London. We don't tell Frankfurt when he rocks up there.That makes us safer?</comment>

<comment>I agree on both levels.  May is unable to protect anyone as Home Secretary, primarily because we no longer have the manpower, equipment, or the political will to safeguard our own borders .</comment>

<comment>Ask the EU Bank to give us the EU 1 million Euros we loaned , that should cover the cost of a couple of small ships going around our Coast every hour</comment>

<comment>The Border Agency is a waste of space, lost track of thousands who were being investigated. Australia has the right idea, have their Border Agency  on a small Island off the Coast and any suspected illegal is put on the next plane back to where he/she came from .</comment>

<comment>Hi anglocynic , there must be a budget for all departments and knowing that the Calais problem highlighted the need for security , and we witnessed small dinghies arriving on Lesbos surely someone in Government suddenly realised Britain is unprotected . Just think what the EU million lent to the EU Bank recently would have been put to better use securing our Borders.</comment>

<comment>Please don't expect a sensible answer from sonoflatue - the bloke is a cretin.</comment>

<comment>Certainly looks that way.  Or a paid EU stooge.</comment>

<comment>Yes, they will vote to leave the EU and then realise the mistake they have made and seek re-entry. That will be on EU terms including Schengen and the Euro!None of the exit campaigners seem to have any sort of realistic view about what to do once out. They seem to think there will be untold riches and that the relationship with the EU will continue as now without legislation, rules or anything else they don't like. They need to speak to a few Norwegians. The rest of the world will not be queuing up to trade with us or do any favours. The US has already made it clear that there will be no separate trade deal and other big manufacturers who trade here because we are inside the EU will move to cheaper locations in places like Romania and Bulgaria.The first winter out will be very long and cold but they will have what they deserve. I'm lucky, I have a property in Germany where I will go.No doubt a gang of out-trolls will be along any moment to say I'm talking rubbish but they won't have any answers about what they will do the day after we leave</comment>

<comment>don't understand the 4 yr benefits cut for migrants imbroglio. those against say it must also apply to uk residents returning to uk. fine. then why not give those returnees a separate payment equal to the benefits they would lose- we could call it 'a uk citizens resettlement grant'. there's more than one way to skin a cat.</comment>

<comment>Not allowed old boy.  Art.18 TFEU.  A seperate payment made only to uk citizens would be discriminatory.  Truth is you really shouldn't be entitled to benefits unless you have paid in - every other EU country insists you do.  Our flabby welfare state starts doling out the cash as soon as term ends.  However to apply a 4 year wait to British citizens as well would look horrific within the context of a 'renegotiation'.  Dunno how he gets out of this one.</comment>

<comment>If gimmigrants coming into the UK have not paid into the system they should get sweet FA.  Former British residents (who for years paid into the system) returning to the UK should get benefits commensurate with what they have paid in.</comment>

<comment>I came back to the UK after being away for a year in Europe.  As I was technically unemployed I strolled into the Job Centre.  I was very quickly told there would be nothing for me until I had paid into the system.  That was about 20 years ago - has it changed?</comment>

<comment>Oh good, that means we can all stop thinking for ourselves.</comment>

<comment>When are you going to start?</comment>

<comment>With that kind of logic you probably never did</comment>

<comment>I thought you already had.</comment>

<comment>"But even the Paris attacks and the clear need to integrate European crime databases – together with a scaremongering campaign which warned that a "no" vote would leave Denmark at the mercy of a wave of terrorists and paedophiles – were not sufficient to persuade the Danes to vote "yes""All that is needed to integrate European crime databases is for the national police services of Europe to talk to each other. We don't need a £12 billion per annum membership fee, or a European superstate, to cooperate with other friendly governments.</comment>

<comment>I agree, you mean like INTERPOL?  The issue will be highlighted by the EU elite as yet another reason for "more" EU not less.</comment>

<comment>Following the Paris attacks it transpired that they don't even share Passenger Information Lists and .... are now begging for 'more co-operation'.Could we be any less safe?</comment>

<comment>Exactly. Do you think we wouldn't share best practice fire fighting techniques if we didn't 'belong'? They take us for fools.</comment>

<comment>My dad says that since UKIP cannot get a foot on the ground and they are the only party wanting to leave Europe, the referendum will only end one way. My dad is never wrong.</comment>

<comment>You have been tweaking the upvotes, haven't you?  How pathetic.  :>(</comment>

<comment>Your dad forgot to mention the electorate to you & of course the fact this vote crosses party lines, still I feel sure your dad will ensure you don't waste your vote & is as I write completing your postal vote for you.......does he cut the crust off your soldiers too?</comment>

<comment>Tell your Dad that while almost all UKIP supporters are EU 'outers' not all EU outers are UKIP supporters.</comment>

<comment>UKIP is unlikely to run the official Leave campaign.</comment>

<comment>I do not recognise anyone who runs any Leave campaign. I know Stuart Rose though, my auntie always buys her dinner in one of his shops on a Sunday when I go round to see her. It is very nice and fattening which is why auntie is a big woman.</comment>

<comment>Poor old Stuart lost the franchise when it was realised he'd made a pigs ear of it too......& the shops didn't even sell them</comment>

<comment>Your Dad sounds a bit of a pillock to me.</comment>

<comment>That is not a very nice thing to say to someone you do not know. :(</comment>

<comment>Well, if he considers himself to be never wrong he sounds a bit of a know-all pillock to me.</comment>

<comment>Bless himThere is a first time for everything</comment>

<comment>Remind your Dad that there is a cross party And unionist coalition to leave the EU!</comment>

<comment>Is it possible you have been overwhelmed by the media hype?</comment>

<comment>No. Not at all, actually. I was an attendee of the EU referendum conference in London October 2011. You can see it on YouTube. 'the People's Pledge'. Or read the morning star.</comment>

<comment>I am afraid I do not follow. How will reading the morning star change what the world is really like?</comment>

<comment>It'll give you a warm red glow</comment>

<comment>Thank you, Mr Corbyn.</comment>

<comment>Check out his brother. One of us sensible types when it comes to man made global warming. 'Piers Corbyn' Weather Action dot com.  He knows that man made global warming is a political corporate stitch up.</comment>

<comment>So a propaganda artist knows (gets paid to say) science is a stitch up. Hmm!</comment>

<comment>My heart warmed to him on Andrew Neil's little progDr Tim Ball must be smiling too.Coincidentally I just bought his bookThe Deliberate Corruption of Climate Scienceaccompanied by'The Propaganda Bureau'by A W Montford.what a relief to read some more sane writing.</comment>

<comment>Hence the need to defend it from those who want to steal it - we are Sovereign at present, of course.</comment>

<comment>Worse: Governments have given Our sovereignty to an unelected offshore body And £billions of Our cash and gold, fish, Etc. in addition!</comment>

<comment>So you lie, and then whine about how trade is allowed. Hmm.</comment>

<comment>...and our goldfish? The devils.</comment>

<comment>Good to see the Establishment PR Service (msm) covering this result so diligently.</comment>

<comment>I am very sorry to say this but the British have a terrible habit of bottling out at the last minute. The success of UKIP in the local elections has not translated yet into wholesale support for a no vote. In fact, everything indicates that the electorate sways from one day to the next, as do those parts of the media, such as the Daily Telegraph which at times is eurosceptic and at times not.These changes indicate that anti-europeanism among the British stems not from principle ( being that europe is bad for the UK ) but from emotion.Those motivated by emotion sadly do not either have the sense nor the strength of character to make a decision and stick by it but are rather prey to all the trickery of politicians and the duplicity of the media coupled with endless prevarication as to the date of the referendum.This is rather shaming when held up to the guttsiness of other nations, such as Denmark which have more than once voted against the EU. This may account for the fact that every decade 3,000,000 Britons opt to leave their native country. The rats are remaining and sadly it is the ship that is leaving with those eager to live in countries that still adhere to what were traditional British values.</comment>

<comment>One could suggest that a loyal Labour voter may think, 'what is the point of voting for UKIP in a by-Election when I intend to vote to leave the EU at the referendum anyway?</comment>

<comment>It may be that UKIP is not the only anti-EU show in town. Corbyn has yet to show his cards. Maybe he hasn't made up his mind, maybe he realises that many of his grassroots can't yet take the truth.Fascinating to see how the msm treat the Oldham result, BTW ... now had Corbyn lost and UKIP not come second, adn teh Tories not scraped < 1 vote in ten, I think we can be sure hackland would be all over that like a toxic fog.(I live in Spain, BTW! But I will always love Old Blighty.)</comment>

<comment>The govIf you lived here you might not love it so much. In fact it's not Blighty anymore.It's an overcrowded bottlenecked stink hole filled by people living on benefits because Allah said they should. </comment>

<comment>I thought it was Blair and then Cameron who made it possible? Pbuh(them)</comment>

<comment>The EU is not a bad idea. What is fundamentally wrong is this idea of German domination and elevation to the status of guardian and policeman of Europe. The world defeated Germany in 1945, why should we allow them to resuscitate their imperialistic tendencies through the EU again?</comment>

<comment>Never mind the facts?</comment>

<comment>That was always the intention, their two previous attempts at being a world super power failed badly......</comment>

<comment>"Their". Always the other guy, isn't it.</comment>

<comment>The EU is a very bad idea.</comment>

<comment>What is fundamentally wrong is the fact that laws are passed that affect each and every one of us by bureaucrats that we haven't voted for and whose credentials we know nothing about.</comment>

<comment>So you don't understand how the EU works. Right.</comment>

<comment>I think the EU is a very bad idea, because it is supposed to be the united states of europe, and as you have said the Germans now run it, I dont mindthe Germans, it is their politicians I cannot stand, Merkel is the new fuhrerand I dislike her intensely, so I am for out, for independence, for sovereignty..</comment>

<comment>Europe didn't need to be ruled by Britain to adopt the Plimsol Line for shipping nor to adopt the jet engine or radar, etc. Never mind GMT or the fact airline pilots sit to the left.</comment>

<comment>And yet you still oppose them, right.</comment>

<comment>I don't think I have met a Danish woman who I didn't love, I now extend that adoration to the whole nation...or at least 53% of them.  Europe is going through it's death throes, Germany is running the show and France are trying to hang on to the tiger's tail ( as they have most unsuccessfully for 200 years), the rest of us don't really matter.  Is that democracy?I'm not a great believer in instant democracy in the 3rd world because they have 1000 years of catching up to do, but the concept of democracy in Europe has been acknowledged for decades and is accepted by us all.  Why give it away to a bloated FIFA-style bureaucracy of make-weights?I won't bash Cameron for lack of information about his terms for Europe because it's his bat-and-ball having won the election, negotiating in public is not effective.Cameron is not the naïve pillock he pretends to be for the ignorant, he's actually playing his cards close to his chest and will get something dramatically positive out of his negotiations because if he doesn't he is politically scuppered.</comment>

<comment>I see what you mean. I can't help it but the first thing I think of is pork. That aside and to your other point; Cameron has no intention of bringing home the bacon, when it comes to matters EU: he wears EU flag cufflinks.</comment>

<comment>You need to meet more Danes.</comment>

<comment>"death throws"It's not some kind of lethal blanket: http://www.johnlewis.com/searc...It's the pangs or spasms of death throes: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki..."a bloated FIFA-style bureaucracy of make-weights"Perfect description.</comment>

<comment>Apologies for death throws, momentary word-blindness.</comment>

<comment>I agree with you. I married one and live here.The failed EU fantasy project will end it is just when and how. Its conception and implementation was badly thought out and in the long term toxically unsustainable. There will be many casualties along the way including Greece. Time will tell.</comment>

<comment>My dear friend, it was a deliberate lie foisted on us all that the cosy Common Market that allowed free trade and a deal on Coal and Steel was actually a plan for a federal Europe and nothing less.  Please continue to love your wife and her Dannishness and never loose sight of the fact that her 'difference' is an attraction, not a reason to go to war as the Europhiles would have us believe.  We all know that the concept is a French plot to stop Germany taking over...but guess what!</comment>

<comment>...idiot, Cameron looked for advice from an old rook...too bad, when Europe is finally a perpetual warrant of arrest of your freedom(that which you think your country deserves), then will you understand that a filial pogram is a sheist of endless upper class schist.</comment>

<comment>So only the criminal classes should be worried, gosh that's a worry!</comment>

<comment>As the Great Leader, Herr Juncker has said, when the chips are down, simply lie to the electorate. Cameron will follow suit in the unlikely event that we get a referendum.</comment>

<comment>I can see 'being at war' as a handy excuse to forestall our referendum</comment>

<comment>"Back came the clear answer – and by a solid 47 to 53 per cent margin"What's so "solid" about a virtual 50-50 split ?</comment>

<comment>Actually 46.9% to 53.1% convincing enough in my book. Would you still have said that if it was the other way round?</comment>

<comment>I'd call it worryingly close.</comment>

<comment>Then I am glad you are not a banker.</comment>

<comment>It's beyond the usual 2% margin of error of polls.</comment>

<comment>Most polls have a three percent margin of error.</comment>

<comment>So it's still beyond the margin of error (or at the very limit).</comment>

<comment>the Danes are very good at politics and can smell the stench of federalism moving their way from a kilometer away. They are definitely not stupid and are a very proud people.</comment>

<comment>You really know nothing about the Danes do you.   They had a vote stupid.  You Euro-filth don't like that ....  Do you .</comment>

<comment>Why the abuse in response to a perfectly reasonable post?</comment>

<comment>Clever trick there.   The new Guardian leadership of the paper didn't put a 'None just leave' choice .      </comment>

<comment>The D Tel polls are trolls. Worthless. Best ignored.</comment>

<comment>Who would want an integrated EU law enforcement agency when there are sophisticated international terrorists and organised international criminal gangs out there trying to do us harm?Plod will protect us surely without Johnny Foreigner's help.</comment>

<comment>As i see it the Danes were more against the other 22 things on the ballot paper. So there was no choice but to vote no. Nej tak.Everybody knows when you give small concessions to the EU they end up taking over your whole country.</comment>

<comment>"Back came the clear answer – and by a solid 47 to 53 per cent margin – “no”."A "clear answer"? By a massive six-point margin?And if the same question were asked in six months time, a year's time, then only a 3% swing would bring everything back into deadlock.It is way past time that special majorities be introduced for referendum voting.When an issue is deemed to be very significant, then a simple majority cannot be acceptable. There needs to be a minimum 55-45 or preferably a 60-40 majority for change.Views will change over time, either by simple mind-changing and/or additional voters coming into the mix.A country cannot make nationally-vital decisions on what people think today, but could change their minds tomorrow.A country cannot decide to exit the EU today, think differently in a few months' time and want to change its mind, then change it back again the following year.The same situation applies with the Scottish referendum. Once out, a country is effectively out forever, and voters need to accept that reality.</comment>

<comment>Too true, Dad. You know so much.</comment>

<comment>"if the same question were asked in six months time, a year's time, then only a 3% swing would bring everything back into deadlock."If my aunt had balls she'd be my uncle.</comment>

<comment>"only a 3% swing would bring everything back into deadlock."If roughly 50% of people are for a particular position a 6% change in the number of voters is required to move the vote percentage to 53%.</comment>

<comment>A three percent swing from one side to the other would do it. The maths are quite straightforward, son.</comment>

<comment>Thanks, Dad. Maths was never my strong point, as you know from all my Reports.</comment>

<comment>A 3% swing in the overall vote requires a roughly 6% swing within each voting group when the vote is nearly tied. The maths is quite straightforward, grasshopper.</comment>

<comment>So if you don't get the result you want, you simply want to change the rules until you can only get the result you want. Yep, that sounds like the approach of someone who knows that they don't have an argument that will stand up. Because if you did have that argument you wouldn't be wanting to change the rules.Here's the rub, if the result had gone the other way by the same margin I'm willing to bet far more than you are worth that you'd be extolling the 'clear majority' that your preferred faction had won by.</comment>

<comment>Australia, as just one example, has insisted on special majorities since time immemorial for referendums, which are special voting arrangements on key issues only.What logic would apply to allow a single vote to make a vital decision which might bind a country's actions indefinitely because the exhorbitant cost of change and/or the possibility of no-change would apply?</comment>

<comment>It's a majority, simple as that, and those are the agreed rules. You are simply railing against it because your preferred faction lost. If it had been the other way you would have been crowing about the significant victory and there would have been nothing wrong with the rules.I don't care what Australia does, this isn't Australia. You only like the idea because it makes it harder to change the status quo. The status quo being your own preferred position. Which is quite possibly why whoever set the rule up in Australia did it. However, the reverse is true, if the EU faction won by a single vote then that would be a win. We both know you'd defend such a win with everything you had.</comment>

<comment>I am not talking about the outcome of that or any other referendum.The status quo on a vital issue should never be changeable on a simple majority.That is so obviously sensible and logical that it is astonishing you challenge it.Australia understood the importance of having referendums only in exceptional cases and with a special majority proviso.A referendum is not comparable with a vote in parliament where the law can be changed from one term to another.One cannot have a country deciding to become independent on a simple majority. That should be obvious.One cannot have the UK leaving the EU on the basis of a simple majority.Perhaps you should understand the composition effect.</comment>

<comment>I'm trying, Dad, I'm really trying. But it is SO hard. Can you explain it again for me, please?</comment>

<comment>If a government can take a country to war on a simple majority and if a government can be elected on a simple majority.Then living the EU on a simple majority is all what is needed, as the people of Britain have spoken.Unless the under handed use of postal voting comes into play. The only people that will be voting are British Citizens and all others including those from the EU will be excluded.</comment>

<comment>Totally agree - it was a nonsense that the Scottish referendum could have resulted in independence on a vote of 50% + 1 vote.</comment>

<comment>Thanks. I could not believe that this point was not covered widely before and after that vote.What are politicians thinking?</comment>

<comment>I felt much the same and remember finding a very good Wiki article which listed the results of all the independence referenda there have been since 1900 and, although some results were probably 'bent', there was only one (Montenegro a few years ago) when the result was anything like 'close'.  The threshold should have been 60%.</comment>

<comment>I appreciate that and will do some research.</comment>

<comment>This isn't the article I was thinking of, but it makes the same point - scroll down to the bar chart. http://www.theguardian.com/new...</comment>

<comment>yes a solid 6% not an opinion poll a vote.. get back into the EU.. who will make up our contribution to the EU coffers.. the germans? the french? the eu will collapse.</comment>

<comment>Are you going to ask them to vote again? You tried that one once already on the Danes and they still told you to foxtrot oscar.</comment>

<comment>The left celebrated Hollande's magnificent 51-49 victory of Sarkozy - this is 3 times as big - almost a landslide.</comment>

<comment>Mr Cameron is now in the fight of his political life.Never fear, these coniving parasites will con the fools, out of the EU? never with the lying, devious political parasites that the fools continually vote for!</comment>

<comment>as it now becomes clear.. he lied about the 70,000 syrians troops.. TWO DAYS AFTER THE VOTE... Politicians find out that cameron LIED!! (again)''David Cameron 'warned by military chiefs not to claim there were 70,000 friendly Syrian troops'Defence and Whitehall sources expressed fears that the figure would come back to haunt the Government '' http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new... Aha</comment>

<comment>Never fear the fools that think he is doing a great job will continue to swallow his BS. Whilst the people continue to vote for these venal self servers, nothing will improve, only get much worse.</comment>

<comment>I do wonder if David Cameron will take any notice of the referendum just held by Denmark, or whether he is so blinkered that he cannot actually see the massive damage being done to this country simply by being a member of the EU.  It seems our referendum has just been kicked down the road again.  We need someone who will get us out of the EU before it is really too late and we have sunk under EU red tape, and even greater numbers of immigrants.</comment>

<comment>I don't see any damage with the EU membership.</comment>

<comment>If you say so, Dad.</comment>

<comment>So tell me then Jake, in which polling booth did you vote for Donald Tusk, and Juncker?</comment>

<comment>Hey, he's our Dad, and he knows everything. Don't you dare ask him questions like that.</comment>

<comment>Well, apart from the fundamental inability to decide on our own affairs and entrust them to unaccountable incompetents in Brussels, there is the massive drain on our tax-payers to consider.I hope we manage to leave (which we will eventually) before we are bled white.</comment>

<comment>Not forgetting that we pay a lot more in than we get out, so wherever you see a 'project funded by the EU' billboard, it should read 'project funded by the British taxpayer'.Let's just cut out the middleman.</comment>

<comment>People criticise MR Cameron about the paucity of his "demands" I too am disappointed but then I look at what the other parties in Parliament are offering and think that I have to agree at Mr Cameron has. Given every one of us the opportunity to choose whereas the other parties "know what's best for us" So yes, criticise him for lack of demands ( although most would be rejected anyway) but don't criticise him for giving us all a chance to express our gut feelings!!!</comment>

<comment>cameron LIES</comment>

<comment>Yeah yeah yeah, typically ignorant remark. But I'm not surprised</comment>

<comment>You would make a nationally-vital decision based on a "gut reaction"? Really?</comment>

<comment>Yes, Dad.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely. Why? Because my gut reaction is that the grandees of the EU are utterly incompetent, utterly untrustworthy and entirely incapable of understanding that 27 disparate cultures cannot, nor will ever be brought together in a workable union</comment>

<comment>So you don't use knowledge, information, rationality, logic, experience, expertise, etc?Just "gut reaction"?There must be a queue of confidence tricksters trying to track down your location to put one over on you right now!</comment>

<comment>Yes, Dad. No, Dad. I give up, Dad. I can't do anything right, can I, Dad?</comment>

<comment>No, the reporter has this upside down. This "gut" reaction was the pragmatic and logical Danes speaking.The empire builders of Brussels are like  a weird religious cult, anything but logical or pragmatic.</comment>

<comment>Superb analysis sir.  And another 'gut' reaction the EU will be given again!Vote............GREXITReturn.....Sovreignty</comment>

<comment>Well done Denmark.I shall congratulate my Danish friends when I see them soon.We must escape out of this nightmare socialist empire that is strangling the life-blood out of each country, especially the UK. Out now !</comment>

<comment>I speak to Danes on a regular basis and to a man they despise the EU</comment>

<comment>Not disputing you Nitro, but why was the vote so close? By the way I am not an EU lover.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely no idea! because ALL the Danes I speak to despise the EU however they are all self employed or employers and wealth generators so maybe that is an indicator.</comment>

<comment>I live here. They hate Federalism.</comment>

<comment>Really?  47% didn't demonstrate that.</comment>

<comment>46.7% against 53.1% pretty big margin. Danes are passionate about democracy something the EU hates.</comment>

<comment>Hardly a pretty big majority.  1 in 30 changing their minds would have given the opposite result.</comment>

<comment>Rubbish! Just another false claim. What about the Danes to a woman?</comment>

<comment>Danish Women? Yummmmmm!</comment>

<comment>Son...</comment>

<comment>Bravo plucky Danes!   They've smashed the grand illusion that a bigger EU Empire is good, gooder and goodest. Bit isn't this good news for Cameron. EU is no longer the paragon to solve all problems. Needs major change/over haul/ scrap it and go back to EFTA.</comment>

<comment>I don't believe European Red Tape is any worse than what we can create ourselves, and I agree with a lot of European standards. Not sure about border control, it costs money and we aren't prepared to stump up (yet). Sovereignty might be an issue. But I agree with the Court of Human Rights.</comment>

<comment>EU red tape may not be "worse than what we can create ourselves" ... but we can un-create it ourselves too ... that' the difference .....</comment>

<comment>Only in theory.</comment>

<comment>Court of Human Rights has nothing to do with the EU</comment>

<comment>OK, so what does the poll mean by sovereignty? We keep a Parliament, we keep the Royals...?</comment>

<comment>Shame that the Europe issue was drowned out of the campaign in Oldham.  It might have been useful to voters to know what the party really stands for.</comment>

<comment>Maybe time to create a muti tier EU with some being only in the market ( Britain, maybe DK and Sweden) and the core ( Schengen and euro) and we could add the others that are not yet in but aiming at being integrated. We could offer limited rights to those outside the core but still access to the market however with no specila right to block the core....so brits would be happy to be in the larger European market and the core could move forward....however, that type of EU à la arte would be costly for those outside since it's impossible for them to have the same rights....you cannot be in and out... either one or the other.</comment>

<comment>In other words, it can't be fixed. So leave and let it die. Much to the relief of many of Europe's populations I don't doubt.</comment>

<comment>Multi-tier EU?Yep.With us outside it.How they decide to re-enslave themselves once we've left is of little concern</comment>

<comment>Where will you place Turkey?</comment>

<comment>Behind a VERY strong fence.</comment>

<comment>lol</comment>

<comment>Is it just me ?I can understand completely the arguments put forward to leave the EU.But I cannot understand the reasons to remain, because no reasons are put forward.Sure there are  loads of economic warnings , all of which are debated, and all of which are negative. None of them say:  " Join a vibrant economy !  Be part of a successful large federation of countries with a lot of clout !"All the reasons to stay are framed around a narrow definition of the UK economy and possible disadvantages . Yet our democracy is at stake for this !Do we hand over 1000 years of development to avoid some unproved bad economic effects ?   It seems a very bad deal to me. Aren't we supposed to be a nation of savvy traders; what has become of us  ?</comment>

<comment>Clickbait, how can you be so cynical?You are deliberately ignoring the one, single, significant, momentous, crucial, critical, vital, far-reaching, historic, consequential, essential benefit of retaining our membership of the EU.........cheaper mobile phone charges when we go on holiday (assuming we go to another EU country) sometime in ........er...2017?</comment>

<comment>... you forgot to mention straight carrots...</comment>

<comment>"Is it just me ?"Yes. I am sure of that.</comment>

<comment>No, Dad, no. Please explain / answer the question / give some examples of what is asked for. Dad, you can't forever get by on 'because I say so', and it's really funny because I know that you are right in everything you say, yet you get so few up-votes. How dare they be so ungrateful, Dad? Don't they know how right you are?</comment>

<comment>Oh good !Tell me then Jake, what re your positive reasons to stay ?(I don't want the same old warnings)thanks,...</comment>

<comment>You make a very good pointEurophiles  suffer from Political Battered Wives Syndrome...'If we go they're such vindictive bullies that they'll do very nasty things to us, so we'd better stay'or'We're too weak and stupid to make it without them'.LEAVEers offer UK democracy, self-determination and our own proud place in the world.REMAINers offer cringing snivelling servility. Just waiting for the next good thrashing from our Masters.I'll stand up and be counted for a UK where Westminster makes our Laws. Not Brussels.

<comment>Turkey and European leaders have struck a deal to try to control the flow of migrants to Europe.Turkey will receive €3bn (£2.1bn) and political concessions in return for clamping down on its borders and keeping refugees in the country.Talks on Turkey's accession to the European Union will also be revived.Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said it was a "historic day" in Turkey's relations with the EU.Under the deal, Turkish citizens may be able to travel without visas in Europe's Schengen zone, which allows free movement between many European countries, by October 2016.</comment>

<comment>According to the Hungarian prime minister, EU and Turkish leaders are set to announce a behind-the-scenes agreement to resettle hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the war in Syria.It is not known how many of the 500,000 will arrive in Britain, but fears have been raised that a significant number could be drawn to the UK by its relatively generous welfare system.It comes just days after the EU agreed a €3billion (£2.1bn) funding package for Turkey in return for their help in stemming the flow of migrants passing through on their way to Europe.</comment>
