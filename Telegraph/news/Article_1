<div class="body"><p> In short, by slapping Boris down, Mr Cameron has bigged him up - he certainly has as far the media narrative is concerned. Journalists can’t be blamed for revelling in the Dave v Boris bust-up. It’s a damn sight more interesting than wading through the weeds of the European Union’s rules and regs. Even the BBC - who we should be able to rely on to do the boring but important detail of political history – spontaneously combusted at news of Boris’s Brexit intentions. </p><p> Boris can’t be ignored by the PM, of course. He is popular and can generate more coverage than any politician other than, irritatingly, the man he seeks to oust. But No10 have mistaken popularity for persuasiveness. And the ability to persuade is what will, in the end, be tested on June 23. </p><p>

But I’m not convinced too many people ate their lunch on their lap on Sunday, glued to Sky News as they waited for white smoke to emerge from the chimney of Boris’s home. </p><p> If I’m wrong, and they were hanging on his every word, I’m not sure they would have been that impressed when Boris didn’t appear to know the name of the political group he’d aligned his entire political future with. “Vote Leave – or whatever the team is called,” as he put it. Really Boris? And you want me to dive headlong into the dark with you? Amusing? Possibly. Persuasive? Not-so-much. </p><p> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12166345/European-referendum-Michael-Gove-explains-why-Britain-should-leave-the-EU.html">Michael Gove is a far more dangerous opponent</a> and if Vote Leave have any sense, he’ll be given more campaign time than Boris. His long personal statement was a class apart. Where Boris was bumbling, he was articulate, measured and sincere. </p><p> He will also understand, perhaps better than Boris, what is required in the months ahead. To explain, in plain English, to a largely undecided and confused electorate what Brexit might mean to them, their families and their businesses. To answer questions like: “How will it work exactly?”, “How will it affect me and mine precisely?”. </p><p>

</aside><script src="http://cf.eip.telegraph.co.uk/particle-embed/js/particle.js"></script><p></p><p> In contrast to Boris, the Prime Minister is the only man capable of making a detailed, pragmatic case for his team, although he has, so far, also failed to provide the detail required. But there’s time, and even those who dislike Mr Cameron grudgingly admire his uncanny ability to convince, especially when his back is against the wall. </p><p> The Prime Minister, though, should not engage in hand-to-hand combat with Boris; he should delegate the man-marking. In fact, Boris should be woman-marked by Theresa May. He has always struggled to take on female opponents and my money would be on the Home Secretary every time. </p><p> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11131190/Boris-Johnson-vs-Theresa-May-who-would-make-better-Conservative-Party-leader.html">As a front runner for the Tory leadership herself</a>, she would provide a powerful contrast to Boris on the vital questions of loyalty and motive. And it’s win-win: if she can help in the blowing up of Boris, it’ll be one less rival for her to deal with down the road. </p><p> David Cameron is paid by us to worry about Vladimir Putin. He should leave it to others to fret about an ambitious, outgoing Mayor - at least until the day after the referendum. </p><p> <strong><i>Andy Coulson is former No 10 Comms Director</i></strong> </p><p> <iframe frameborder="0" height="350" id="tweetframe" scrolling="no" src="http://renderer.qmerce.com/interaction/56ca288be5be274a1fcdb1a6" width="100%"></iframe> </p></div>
