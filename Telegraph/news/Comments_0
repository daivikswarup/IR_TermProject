<comment>If we leave the EU, if, then be certain that the political and administrative classes will make us suffer for removing their seat at the table of the taxpayer funded monolith that is even more rewarding for them than the (relatively) small beer that is on offer in the UK.</comment>

<comment>Official figures show that 257,000 migrants came to Britain last year, with a significant rise in the number of Bulgarians and Romanians. In the same period 630,000 EU citizens registered for a national insurance number entitling them to work or claim benefits in Britain.  Can Dave explain where the extra 373,000 came from?</comment>

<comment>There is an imminent and grave danger. . If by some collective madness we did vote remain, we will have then recognized, accepted and admitted the 'Joint and Several' liability to the indebtedness of the Bankrupt Institutions, the EU and the European Bank.

<comment>Mercedes-Benz swaps robots for people on its assembly lines  That is why we need to Brexit. Robots are going to take over and we will not need 65mn people in this country. We need to get the population down to 55mn and fast. We are repeating the mistakes of the 70's allowing tens of thousands of pakis to work in the mills and a decade later they were all made redundant from machines and décades later we are still paying for that mistake. Uber drivers/ black cabbies/bus/truck drivers will all be redundant from self driving cars buses and trucks. We need to think ahead about what skills this country needs and it simply is not unskilled or low skilled workers from the EU. We have 1.6mn unemployed of our own who need work or should be forced to work. We need to control our borders and only let in highly skilled or the well heeled who can afford to look after themselves. Its time to be ruthless as there is a 1.6tn deficit to pay off.</comment>

<comment>The current president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, claimed to have been elected to the role, and although that claim was hotly disputed there is ongoing pressure to have an elected European president.So was he elected or not? If you were a serious journalist you would inform us rather than write such rubbish. You could just as honestly write "The current Prime Minister of the UK, David Cameron, claimed, claimed to have been elected to the role, ......"</comment>

<comment>He was elected in a process similar to the ones used by Blatter.</comment>

<comment>This all smacks of desperation, how once great, now dead figures would have stuck with the EU and sorted it all out.We have a whole host of historic greats who, no doubt would think Dave's renegotiation had done the trick.

<comment>Most DT correspondents honestly believe they know exactly how Churchill and Thatcher would react to any contemporary issue.</comment>

<comment>Churchill was in favour of a united Europe but not one that over ruled national parliaments. He helped setup the Council of Europe. The kind of Europe he wanted was the CofE and UNECE. Not a supranational union.</comment>

<comment>Eton College, is an excellent education post If you are uneducated , its your problemI would be more worried if they all agree with each other</comment>

<comment>Europhiles seem to be incapable of learning lessons from history. Take the rise of the Soviet Union. Adopting Marxist-Leninist principles, it was supposed to have created a utopian society where harmony and prosperity for all was guaranteed, everyone working towards a common goal. In practice, it didn't turn out that way. Power was concentrated into the hands of few, and chosen underlings would implement the 5 year plans, all administered by an overarching bureaucracy. If you were not one of favourites, or were dissident, you were an outcast and even an enemy of the state.In this case, we have the rise of the European Union, based on capitalist principles. As with Communism, the vision is for a utopian society where harmony and prosperity are created for all to enjoy. But power is being concentrated into the hands of a few. What's more, the EU has developed its own overarching bureaucracy, answerable to no-one. The European Parliament is a toothless institution giving the veneer of democracy that merely rubber stamps whatever the bureaucracy decides. And it seems that there is a 10 year plan, for economic and monetary union.Grandiose political schemes based on a ruthlessly applied ideology never benefit the majority. In order for the ideology to work, the people have to be forced to fit the ideology, since the architects of that ideology always believe in their own infallibility. If you are not part of the club, then you are an outsider and an outcast. We in Britain have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to decide if we want to be part of the club. If we do, then we must be prepared to surrender our sovereignty and independence over all matters, political and economic, to the unelected leaders of the club. Britain would then become merely one of many administrative regions in the pan-European superstate. On the other hand, if we reject subjugation, then there are plenty of major trading blocs in the world who would willingly do business with us. The question is: do we have the courage to make the political break with the EU?</comment>

<comment>With Ministers of Government who habitually lie and cheat -Immigration figures are more than double what the Government say.The EU is about to claim an EXTRA £20 billion more for its budget. (suppressed until after the Referendum.)VAT is going to 25% and Brits lose all zero or exempt classifications such as Food, Children's Clothing, Medicines, Books etc. Delayed until after the Referendum.The EU will become a virtual "State" when it joins the ECHR. Thus it will be able directly to interfere in our affairs. To be notified after the Referendum.If we remain in the EU we will be punished, taxed and taxed, our Financial Institutions will be second lined unless they set up in Paris or Frankfurt.ONLY Fools or politicians would want to Remain in this EU - this rotten crumbling corrupt EU.So take the SAFE route - Vote To LEAVE the EU.23rd June is our INDEPENDENCE DAY.</comment>

<comment>Technically, the EU already is a state. It just has to declare to the world that it is for that status to be recognised and formalised.</comment>

<comment>Like IS, but worse</comment>

<comment>A good comparison. I had never made that connection before. But, yes, the EU is akin to a terrorist state when you look at its illegitimacy and the terrors it has viciously inflicted on some of its member nations.</comment>

<comment>Well it also needs internationally legal borders and for that the EU thugs need the permission of the subject states.</comment>

<comment>A good point. I would argue that the EU has recognizable borders, by way of EU membership, irrespective of who controls them, and so meets that one of the four requirements for being recognized as a sovereign state.</comment>

<comment>No it does not.Otherwise you could say that Canada, Mexico and the USA have common borders and are members of a trade association and are thus "one country."</comment>

<comment>The EU cannot accept a LEAVE vote. To vote Remain is Madness and the EU will just walk all over us and continue with their superstate.If we vote to LEAVE article 50 will not be signed immediately as Cameron will resign and will be too busy as he will be packing his bags.Whether Fox or Boris takes over the EU will demand to talk, they need us far more than we need them.Its not even just the trade deficit its the 25bn pounds we pay them every year as second biggest payer.How will they pay all their inflated salaries expenses pensions and fleets of mercedes and private jets?To vote Remain is Madness, To vote LEAVE will get us more of what we want.I would suggest we ask for as a minimumOur fisheries back and our 200 mile exclusion zone.All major laws must be debated and signed off by our own parliamentControl of our borders and no free movement of people and an Australian style points system of immigration.Supremacy of our own supreme court to allow us to get rid of bad people without recourse to the ECJ.Ability to remove EU prisoners from our jails and they must be jailed and serve their sentences in their home countries.UK to have ability to sign its own trade dealsNo benefits to EU migrants for 10 years and they must bring their own private health insurance.Reduction of our EU fees by 50% considering the trade deficit.</comment>

<comment>It's sad that you paint a picture of Britain that is pretty typical of that of a free nation, and, somehow, the Remainians find it to be radical or distasteful or, worse yet, scary. We need to be a free country again, and, by regaining that freedom, we will set an awful lot of other people free, not just in the EU, but, eventually, in all of the corporatist regional "unions" globally. The UK's independence could start a global wildfire that consumes corporatism across the world and for generations to come!</comment>

<comment>Another horrible thought....if the UK remains - the EU can and probably will change a country's ability to LEAVE the EU to make it difficult or impossible.Today the EU is accusing Hungary of "populism" and behaving in a "right wing fashion" because the Hungarians are going to have a Referendum on Immigration EU style.The EU is run by 32 unelected people who are neither honest nor decent - and there are STILL people who think staying in the EU is a good idea???</comment>

<comment>How the EU would dominate us if we stayed inside_________________Similar to the way US dominates UK from the outside ?We hear a lot about the risks of Brexit, but here's a dispassionate look at   what could happen if we remain in the European Union__________________Even the right wing media acknowledges that EU is a scapegoat and a very popular choice to blame when things go wrong.The writer thinks, DT is a pro-European outlet.</comment>

<comment>As far as I can tell, Britain's position in the European Union is roughly the same as in the Eurovision Song Contest. In other words it is never going to win because there are blocks of countries (Balkans, Baltics, Scandinavia, Med zone, German speakers) who vote for each other regardless of the quality of the songs on offer. The likelihood of any Briton becoming President of the EU is remote to impossibly unlikely. Thus just as we are lucky to come in off the bottom of the Eurovision heap, so we are never going to win the argument in the EU. Let's get out now while we still have shirts on our backs and trousers to wear.</comment>

<comment>Alain, are you sober this evening?</comment>

<comment>Hello,My name is David Cameron and my aim is to destroy Britain as you know and love it.That is why in the last 12 months alone, I have admitted 650,000 newcomers and 65,000 asylum seekers and I have made it easy for illegals to enter the country and remain here forever. I will of course repeat this policy this year and every year during my premiership.Up and down the country, I am being told that my plans are working perfectly as people find they are becoming 'Strangers Where They Live'  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new... , and I am delighted my Defence Minister, Michael Fallon, has told me that our towns and cities are being enrichingly 'swamped with immigrants' http://www.theguardian.com/uk-...As the 'Heir to Blair', I am proud to be continuing the pro immigration policies adopted by my close friends in the Labour Party and to be able to develop such ideas to extinguish 'Britishness' wherever it may be found. That is why I have abolished many of the planning rules in order to easily build huge new towns and cities, and also to enrich my banker and developer friends, in what was the unnecessary and socially divisive English countryside http://www.dailymail.co.uk/new...I will soon be holding the long awaited confirmation of my views and opinions that Britain should remain an EU member forever and I will personally ensure that the Remain campaign is full of lies and propaganda to obtain the highly desirable Remain outcome thereby wiping the floor with a large long blonde haired mop.As you will understand from the foregoing, I am very excited about the forthcoming abolition of Britain and 'Britishness' by the enrichers, and by my friends in the European Union who have assured me that a new name has already been decided for these very small inconsequential islands..They have chosen 'EU Sector North West' which must now be written below your postcode or your mail will no longer be delivered.God Save The President of the EU Commission.  Rule Jean-Claude Juncker.Yours sincerelyDavid CameronGovernor. EU Sector North West (Designate).</comment>

<comment>Who would betray their neighbours? Their Family? Their friends? Their community?Their Country?For these are the people who would vote Remain.TAKE your Freedom - and resist those who would steal it from you.Vote to LEAVE this fascist EU - it is the only SAFE way.</comment>

<comment>agnasevennine: Believe you me, the power of positive prayer is the only power available to get our Nation, our People, out of the unholy mess our governments have got us into over the years; especially kowtowing as they have to the ever growing, far from democratic, and now monstrous EU; not to mention our involvement with the Sunni Shia situation in our Bible Lands. Love of money truly is the root of all evil ...Our Father, which art in heaven,Hallowed be thy Name.Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven.Give us this day our daily bread.And forgive us our trespasses,As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation,But deliver us from evil.For thine is the kingdom, The power, and the glory, For ever and ever.Amen.</comment>

<comment>Amen and Amen.</comment>

<comment>By "The European Project", presumably the writer means the European Union Project".By "completing Europe’s economic and monetary union”, the writer presumably means the European Union's monetary order.This, "appetite" commentmeans nothing, since, despite the UK's lack of appetite for deeper integration, it has no opt-out from adopting the EU laws designed to cause that integration.I also note that there is no significant upside above to the collapse of the EU while the UK is a member.  Is this an oversight or a deliberate omission?And there is significant upside stated for the looser partnership option, which, of course, requires that we remain inside the EU.All-in-all, this analysis doesn't meet the standard it sets itself as being a dispassionate assessment of the UK's EU options. rather, it is a thinly veiled endorsement, via scare mongering, of the UK's continued EU membership in some fashion.</comment>

<comment>Cameron seems to be aiming at a position similar to that of an associate member at a sports club where you can only use the facilities 9 to 5 on weekdays. You cannot participate in the main action; your wishes are always secondary to full members; your opinions don't count. All decisions are made without your input. In short, you are marginalised.It just doesn't work. Partial membership will just see us increasingly marginalised. We need to be either fully in the EU or completely out. Since none of us wish to be subsumed into political union, nor join the currency the solution is simple. Notwithstanding "Project Fear" it will be less painful to exit now rather than try to unravel the spider's web in 15 years time.</comment>

<comment>Don't worry. Once Turkey is accepted then you get all those new immigrants that Germany has been paying them to house.The EU just keeps getting better and better.</comment>

<comment>the euro is close to collapse without the ECB/EU seizing the members 10,500 tons of gold to prop it up, this might save it from the looming fate of the dollar and indeed the collapse of paper gold and derivatives probably due later this year. one more problem with a member state could tip it over the edge and seeing as deutchebank has exposed itself to 80+ trillion in derivatives nothing can save it from a collapse.the EU is increasingly distanced from its electorate who do not really understand it, they do not vote for their highly paid MEPs because the do not think they have a proper say in matters if they are against the flow of ever closer and meddling policies. the eastern bloc states have realised the mistake of joining a organisation desiring to be a clone of the USSR but without the hassle of providing for its people as its policies destroyed viable agriculture and stopped the trade between former communist states which was vibrant before they joined up.watching the debates and that tragedy of a labour shadow foreign minister who claimed the EU is for peace - where was it during the balkans, GW1, kosovo, Iraq, libya, syria all ignored by the EU when it could have been a voice for sanity against US aggression it goes after the Ukraine smelling potential riches to exploit ruining the lives of further millions.</comment>

<comment>The most puzzling development in politics during the last decades is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.</comment>

<comment>gorbachev was most amused by the actions of his former states in their desire for a parent. the EU is less beneficial though.</comment>

<comment>Option 2 is far more probable - the European people won't have any more integration. There is an equal and opposite reaction to integration in the rise of nationalist parties - almost week by week one goes up, the other goes down.The EU will muddle on through and remain incapable of taking any decisions about anything. 98%.</comment>

<comment>Nope. Option1. Superstate.The Eurozone cannot function without full control. This is not even negotiable, it will happen.There is no need to consider any other scenario.</comment>

<comment>there are debates as to whether it is part of a plan to ruin states in order to absorb them into the greater mass.</comment>

<comment>Like the sergeant breaking down new recruits?</comment>

<comment>The integrationists, however, know that they must push on.  It is, after all, an anti-democratic, anti-populist push up the slope to The Globality.  They can't stop where they are, or the democratic will - gravity - will take over.The late-20th century triumphs of elitism over democracy, internationalism over nationalism, and business and banking over peoples and populism is not secure, and will never be secure until the European peoples all across the West are replaced or deracinated.  This is an existential struggle: the elite project of globalism against the life of the European peoples.  Only one will emerge from it with breath in its body.</comment>

<comment>People need more details now, I'm afraid.</comment>

<comment>I doubt the next 4 months will provide many</comment>

<comment>What do you want details on?</comment>

<comment>How are they going to make closer union actually deliver for disparate economies and people?The EZ  was the first move to real union. Economists expected it to drive the disparate economies further apart and create huge debts for the PIIGS which it did.They expected this in turn to lead to countries having to reduce wages and pensions to remain competitive which it has. In turn this lead to reduced demand which in turn lead to high unemployment.  It also means there is no chance of reducing debt.Draghi of the ECB has used threats of  further stimulus successfully to prevent a run on the banks. This is no answer to the plight of the PIIGS.My question is how will the PIIGS become more competitive with Germany? They have no money to invest in boosting the economy and huge debts also make this unlikely. It seems to me they are trapped. If the EU has a mechanism to restore them to growth where is it, and what is it, and why aren't they already applying it?Central taxation means central collection and central distribution. The EU will decide how this taxation is allocated. You don't have to be a genius to see that this will means the rich countries (like Germany) paying  but only a percentage of tax comes back to Germany. The  largesse will be handed out to the PIIGS and the East Europeans as part of the level playing field philosophy. I suspect this will be a non starter with Germans,Hence central taxation will be very divisive. Germany opposes money transfer or the PIIGS escaping their debts and yet this will be exactly what central taxation achieves.Will Germany accept this any more than they have accepted the PIIGS being let off their debts? Greece is bankrupt but is still being expected to pay back its debts.</comment>

<comment>Agreed, full union would imply and require monetary, fiscal, legal union at least and probably cultural and maybe linguistic union in due course. All this in a continent full of diversity in all those fields, which would inevitably necessitate a great degree of coercion and centralised control.All the existing 'superstates' are either basically pretty homogenous (USA) or have a dominant majority imposing its will on those less fortunate (Russia, China, India). Historically the artificial constructs embracing disparate cultures broke up messily (Austro-Hungary, Yugoslavia). People generally seek self-determination, which is why Ireland, Norway, Iceland, Czech/Slovakia etc are now independent nations. Conversely, the initial unification of Germany worked as did its reunification a century later and even the Anschluss.</comment>

<comment>We were never made aware of deeper political union or even made aware that was the ultimate aim. As far as we knew this was a trade agreement between seven countries. I wonder how many would have voted to join it had they known the truth and the same applies today - how many know where the EU is really heading and how far they are willing to go to achieve it? This whole EU thing stinks of fascism.</comment>

<comment>The truth of "ever closer union" was in the preamble to the Treaty of Rome. You didn't have to read past page 1. And if this is "ever closer union", then when does integration stop? Answer: never.It's not rocket science, I'm afraid...</comment>

<comment>The reason the uk is consistently outvoted in the eu is obvious. Other more successful member states do not subscribe to Tory politics. </comment>

<comment>What has happened to the police who turned a blind eye to what was going on in Rotherham?It makes sickening reading. I think the whole of the country was brainwashed to turn a blind eye or else risked being called racist. We have always called a spade a spade in this country, it's about time we got back to it. B-----r human rights.The thing that will set us on the way to recovery, VOTE LEAVE</comment>

<comment>Strange that you have left out the most likely scenario, that it simply collapses due to the bickering over the migration crisis. I use the term "migration" advisedly because any fool is able to see that the percentage of people coming who could be considered to be refugees in any normal sense of the word is very small. When Merkel gave out her invitation to the worlds poor to "come to Germany" it was obvious that Germany would not be able to cope alone and yet now they are claiming it is not a German problem but for the EU as a whole to deal with. This is quite rightly causing huge resentment and not only outside Germany. Their own people are equally angry.It is this crisis more than any other that has the potential to cause break up of the EU and all the hand wringing by EU leaders will not help. Eastern European countries in particular will never agree to take meaningful numbers of ethnic peoples so different from their own for the simple reason that civil war would result. The fact that German leaders are unable to see this shows they are not as clever as they think they are.It is easy to claim that all the peoples of the EU are the same but the truth is very different.</comment>

<comment>All the more so if you actually look at what has happened to population. Many EU Member States reached their peak populations years (even decades) ago. Not everywhere is like the UK and France, with a (by world standards steady, but certainly tangible) population increase for decades...</comment>

<comment>Imagine, for a moment, that we vote to remain in the EU.   As the Leviathan rumbles on toward ever closer union, what will be the effect?  The UK will find itself isolated.   Heard that before?  That's the way the remain people say we will end up if we leave. So better to get out now and start the process of running our own lives and country again.  Of holding our own politicians to account.  Of requiring our politicians and Civil Servants to do their jobs properly.  Of being in control of our own destiny!</comment>

<comment>And rid ourselves of the garbage of EU Legislation which is clogging every human activity in our country.</comment>

<comment>Police to increase patrols in Rotherham as they fear an increase in revenge attacks on muslims, surely their time would be better spent finding other perpetrators, wasn't the police part of the problem in Rotherham</comment>

<comment>The the police should turn a blind eye, like they did to those little girls.</comment>

<comment>No, that would be racist. The only people above the law are the corrupt (not all) police and rag heads!</comment>

<comment>No mention of Merkel's offer to Turkey to expedite their membership of the EU or of the progress of the poor, mainly muslim Balkan countries who are also due to join an enlarged EU.Our past experience of Romania and Bulgaria, will provide an idea of how many Turks etc will make for the UK, especially since Germany has restricted welfare  benefits to EU migrants.http://eeas.europa.eu/western_...http://www.thelocal.de/2016022...</comment>

<comment>How did Germany manage to restrict migrant welfare benefits without treaty change or EU approval? Have they also restricted it for German Nationals too? We cannot impose any restrictions because of EU rules yet Germany can?</comment>

<comment>I think it is because their system is partly based on contributions</comment>

<comment>If the Turks turn down Merkel, then that's the end of her in office. Historically, Turkey has always been at the receiving end of Western imperialism; ordered to 'do whatever', regardless of the consequences for itself. One thinks those times haven't changed, but Erdovan has every reason to snub her.</comment>

<comment>Historically, Turkey has always been at the receiving end of Western imperialism;You've got me on that one</comment>

<comment>If Germany can do this, why can't the UK?</comment>

<comment>Exactly what I was thinking. Our politicians are too scared of Merkel, too prim and proper to force any kind of change and that's reflected in Camerons sham 'renegotiation'.</comment>

<comment>For an amusing video of who are typical In or Out supporters, see the article in today's (Friday's) DT by Dan Hodges.Warning: Some Outers may be offended.</comment>

<comment>It was amusing. Didn't surprise me young female greens want in. The same type who want open borders and the other feminist goals.</comment>

<comment>Who, outside the EU fantasy world, wants it to become a superstate?</comment>

<comment>Now as always, the elites who benefit most directly, never mind about how detached from reality the ideas pursued actually are. And never mind how much certain countries have to pay the price for others...</comment>

<comment>We are already at the coffee and biscuits stage. If we vote to stay in the meal is over. A vote for remain means zero negotiability and Brussels can safely ignore us. If you want certainty, or maybe as some think, want to oblige the EU to re-set the clock and negotiate a radical new deal you must vote leave. </comment>

<comment>If we vote to leave then whatever Brussels discusses will be irrelevant as the EU will collapse - that's one thing all EU leader agree on so what's the point voting to remain unless you are 100% happy with the way things are currently.</comment>

<comment>Any population or country that finishes  a meal with " coffee and biscuits " doesn't deserve to remain in The E U....</comment>

<comment>Agree. They would finish it with bottles of Gout de Diamants with Coffin Bay King Oysters all at EU taxpayers expense - because they believe they are worth it...</comment>

<comment>Accuse me (falsely) of lacking a sense of humour, but I simply don't get this / find it droll. May I perhaps be permitted to share the joke?</comment>

<comment>I agree. Let's get the EU to pass a directive to ban it.</comment>

<comment>Well it's more civilised than breaking the plates.</comment>

<comment>As the article states, If we stay, it will most likely be business as usual for the EU. Any concessions granted will be quietly withdrawn and we'll be expected to go along with 'ever closer union', we'll have to take our allocated share of migrants, we'll have to pay our share of the costs of the difficulties of the southern european countries for whom the euro is a millstone, and we'll have to pay our share of the ever increasing cost of the Brussels bureaucracy.These socialist political union things never last. The choice is whether we get out now, or whether we go down with the ship.One thing is clear, the Brussels bureaucracy will spend as much money as each country has to preserve their utopia, and each country will be bankrupted in this process. If we wait for this to happen, we'll be in a much worse state than if we leave now and make our own way in the world, while we still can.</comment>

<comment>Two things.First Rotherham, had this been white men abusing coloured girls I suspect that today we would have had rioting in the streets and demands for 'respect'.Second. Europe. Whatever we do they'll try to make it hard for us so we might as well leave and at least control our own destiny.</comment>

<comment>The men convicted in the Rotherham crimes had nothing whatever to do with the EU, as you very well know.</comment>

<comment>Correct, and your point is what precisely?</comment>

<comment>Please read the article above. That is what we are commenting on.</comment>

<comment>Although you are right on what we are commenting on who put you in charge? I still want to live in a free country that is not governed by Hitlers, however petty.</comment>

<comment>Well my dear friend as the DT restrict us talking about these things some of us have to make the best of the situation and comment where we can. The DT have forgotten 'Je suis Charlie'</comment>

<comment>Thanks anyway for your courtesy; unusual these days.</comment>

<comment>No problem, I just wish more people would disagree politely.Cheers.</comment>

<comment>First, I have my own criticism of Bush Sr, the President of USA agreeing to Kohl's request not to block German re-unification, despite Thatcher warnings to Bush that about the reunified Germany acting in a strong way aligning with Mitterand, who was persuading Kohl to accept a common European currency and a single region for this.  Bush did not care about Europe.  He ignored Thatcher's suggestion of serious discussions among the 3 Western powers -US, France and UK,, before Germany re-unification.Now, Lord Howard who has put succinctly the case for Brexit,  must have drummed into Cameron's head about the EU as his mentor. Cameron is behaving like Blair.We were never trusted inside the EU, tolerated barely because of our 10+ billion contribution  This being the case, it is naive to think about the EU will trust and tolerate us p;ost-referendum , should the voters say that we should "Remain".  Cameron had strong cards and still he got nothing.  I do not see any other way, except to vote OUT.    Ridiculous to argue like Cameron and Osborne-the two  rich dimwits, when n o country will refuse to enter into trade if they have goods and services to trade.  We have too.  The rest of the world will settle to the new reality of Britain outside the EU.  We can get good price if we let competitors from the EU countries to quote us.Vote Brexit on June 23rd.</comment>

<comment>I'm surprised how low they give the chances of collapse given the wide range of potential causes.</comment>

<comment>Eventual collapse is pretty much a guarantee. However, the article assumes over the next 15 years only and, in that timeframe, probably unlikely.</comment>

<comment>Half that I`d say, max. Just a feeling. Intuition.</comment>

<comment>More like wishful thinking but I'm with you all the way. Just hope we get clear  beforehand.</comment>

<comment>The most likely scenario for the EU is a combination of the above: a European superstate followed by collapse. Once the Germans, Dutch etc understand from bitter experience that a Eurozone superstate requires a pooling of debts and massive, permanent transfers of financial resources from north to south they will vote to withdraw from it and it will collapse. It is the fruition of this mad dream of a union of the totally unequal and divergent that will  bring about its downfall.</comment>

<comment>Now this is getting silly! Natalie Bennett from the Greens who was on today's Daily Politics said "if we leave the EU, our air and water would become dirtier". They must be getting desperate!</comment>

<comment>Stay in the EU and the only certainty is water at some point will be getting in short supply, extra millions but no extra infrastructure to deal with it.Power is even more critical.</comment>

<comment>Wow. See you at the fayre. Madame Tatiana.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense- "EU will swallow up the UK" It doesn't happen in other european countries, Why? Because they don't slavishly follow every EU regulation to the letter, if they follow at all.Instead of every Clipboard Charlie in local and national government saluting the EU every time a new regulation is announced and over zealously going out to harass and fine the populace with vigour-treat EU regs as "advisory" at best, or ignore them like Spain, France, Portugal, and Italy do.</comment>

<comment>I never could fathom why it was felt to be necessary to do this,  but suspected that it was because our 'leaders' have an identity of vision with Jean-Claude Junker.  If ever I saw a sinister-looking old bird   .......</comment>

<comment>I wonder if secretly they all want to leave, ... which is why we were offered no credible deal....</comment>

<comment>It's a thought but I suspect the truth is that they are so arrogant, so steeped in unshakeable belief in the 'Project', that they can't understand why anyone would want to leave, or that they should be offered any inducement to stay in they threaten to quit.I've been quitre pleased at the way the Brexit cause is progressing, and the hopeless, fearful whining of the 'remainders' is falling apart.</comment>

<comment>Press Release: World's biggest think tank urges Britain to leave EU https://www.theparliamentmagaz...</comment>

<comment>Whenever anybody talks of " think-tanks" I try to imagine the wet fish who must inhabit them....</comment>

<comment>I agree with them but the Heritage Foundation is hardly an impartial observer."The Heritage Foundation is a research and educational institution—a think tank—whose mission is to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense."http://www.heritage.org/about</comment>

<comment>The EU's track record suggests there can be a half-way option between 'muddle-through' and 'collapse'.  To take the ERM for example, that was total failure. But instead of being abandoned, the currency bands were expanded to the point that they became meaningless.  This allowed the elites to continue to claim that there was an ongoing Exchange Rate Mechanism and to avoid the admission of defeat. The euro has, likewise, been a complete failure on any objective measure but will never be abandoned.'Muddling-through' implies eventually getting to the desired outcome, while 'collapse' suggests ceasing to exist.  The EU and it's foolish projects will fail, but will also endure. So we can expect a thing called Schengen to persist, despite many member states operating border controls to control immigration.There are simply too many people making too much money from shuffling paper and holding meetings for the EU to ever actually admit defeat in any area of its operation. If we don't want to continue to pay for the whole stupid enterprise then we need to leave.</comment>

<comment>Do I have any confidence in the future of the euro ? NoDo I have any confidence in Merkel's invite and immigration policy ? NoDo I want EU law to remain supreme over UK law ? NoDo we currently have control over our borders ? NoDo we currently have control over immigration numbers? NoThe one question I want answered is something we will have to wait to find out -Norway signed trade deals and were asked/forced to accept free movement as part of payment - they also signed schengen - forced or asked?I keep reading they will force the UK to accept free movement as part of any trade deal - so it is futile for us to leave the EU. Is this true or are the remain camp on the scare stories again ?</comment>

<comment>There are about 160 countries not in the EU. How many of them are forced to accept free movement? China, for example?People who are pushing that Norway thing are not telling the truth.</comment>

<comment>Well I myself am part of the "remain camp" but I hadn't already thought of the argument you supply in your final paragraph......although I think it is a powerful one.....Thanks for the tip !</comment>

<comment>It is a risk us leavers are happy to take - EU law should not ever be supreme over UK law.No matter how much it costs to right that wrong, it is a price well worth paying.</comment>

<comment>There is no risk. Many countries don't have free movement of labour.What Norway did is up to them and irrelevant.</comment>

<comment>I believe that will happen (it also happened in Switzerland) however, the issue then becomes OK - do you want us more than we need you? It all depends on your bargaining chips.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I understand that, a bit like who blinks first. Some in the EU suggest they will make us suffer, but that would mean laying off their own workers to spite the UK.Really ? if they stoop that low I would rather be out and bankrupt than have friends like that.</comment>

<comment>The main point is that we will survive and thrive. May be some short term pain but long-term it's sunny uplands all the way.</comment>

<comment>Norway's position is a bit odd in that as a non-EU country it originally couldn't be part of Schengen. Instead, it had something called the Nordic Passport Union with Iceland, Denmark, Sweded and Finland. Norway got dragged into Schengen by virtue of being part of the NPU which included EU-member Schengen countries.</comment>

<comment>It is a scare story.  Spain for starters would give us whatever deal we wanted- and Italy. France and Germany would have to follow suit pronto however much they bleated about it.. or their own exports to us would take a hit. Under Boris or Gove as PM we would be in no mood for any daft compromises and this assumes the EU even survives our departure- unlikely.</comment>

<comment>Once we're out the EU will be in no position to force us to do anything.</comment>

<comment>Yes, we have to leave completely.  No EFTA</comment>

<comment>It might be possible to get the EU countries to bid against each other for access to OUR market.</comment>

<comment>Certainly. 'Most favoured nation' status for trading with Europe's biggest importer would be a prize indeed.</comment>

<comment>...and individual states especially in southern Europe have no particular EU loyalty. They will all be lining up to do trade deals with us. We probably already have the deals roughed out.</comment>

<comment>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...</comment>

<comment>Perhaps Vidar would be better off explaining all that to his fellow countrymen, who have voted 3 times not to join the EU.</comment>

<comment>"During the past 20 years, Norway has incorporated more than 10 000 EU rules into the EEA Agreement. We see the results of these rules every day – in our daily lives, in our work and in business. However, we have had little direct influence over their development. Although we implement more than three quarters of EU legislation, we have to work very hard to make our voice heard."</comment>

<comment>I don't know where this uncited quote is from but this film explains why it is nonsense. https://dotsub.com/view/e567a6...</comment>

<comment>Sorry but I cannot watch a 36-minute video.</comment>

<comment>Put that in context with the 67000 rules the EU have imposed.</comment>

<comment>So the EU do infringe on our daily lives not something "inners" own up to.</comment>

<comment>Up to them. They're still not members.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps you did not understand his point.Leaving the EU will not release the UK from these burdens, and will greatly diminish the UK's influence.</comment>

<comment>Of course it will release us from the petty red tape of the EU. We will have to abide by those EU regulations which govern exports in the same way we have to abide by US or Chinese regulations to sell to them, but much of it can go. Don't forget some of that is WTO regulation which applies world wide. Does the UK have a seat on the WTO to influence that? No, we are represented by some midget from the EU.And the UK has no influence on the EU at present, so what would change?</comment>

<comment>Cameron has an each-way bet..he`s not bothered.</comment>

<comment>He's probably off to the US. World Bank would be my guess.</comment>

<comment>And they'd invite him would they ; he'd be a big hitter for them?</comment>

<comment>The question should be asked, is he going to remain an MP.</comment>

<comment>He`ll go looking for handbags with Milliband in New York. The further away the better. I propose that all furniture but fitted with electronic voting software so that consensus based referendum decisions can be taken weekly by the populace, straight after the lottery. Get rid of both houses of parasites, the commons & lords. I`ll be in charge of the computer that controls the results thank you.</comment>

<comment>Why not refer back to our history books... national fervour never ever changes'Austria was Hungary, Very Very Hungary, Ate a bit of Turkey, Dipped in Greece. Long-legged Italy, kicked poor Sicily, Into the Mediterranean Sea.'The major factors that kept the Empire together were:loyalty to the Emperor: Francis Joseph was personally very popular throughout the empire. He was multi-lingual and spoke nearly all the languages of the Empire.the Catholic religion: - 90% of the population of the Austrian half of the Empire were Catholic and 60% of the Hungarian half were.the civil service and the army, both of which were dominated by Germans.mutual suspicion among the subject peoples.The main ethnic groups in Austria-HungaryGermans 24%	* Croats 5%Magyars (Hungarians) 20%	*Serbs 4%*Czechs 13%	*Slovaks 4%*Poles 10%	*Slovenes 3%*Ruthenians (Ukranians) 8%	Italians 3%.Rumanians 6%	* These peoples are SlavicThe single most important issue facing the Empire was nationalism. This took the form of demands for political and cultural equality for all the different national groups in the Empire. The response of the Germans and Hungarians to these demands was very different.http://www.historyhome.co.uk/e...</comment>

<comment>EXACTLY what I have been posting over and over again on this site day after day since 20 February. It is heartening to see this reflection.The poll in the middle reveals that most agree the first scenario is by far the most likely and this is ruinous for Britain because we will always be the Black Sheep, the Doubting Thomas seen as the snotty kid in the corner who won't join the fun.No deference at all will be given to our interests and so ironically a vote to stay in ends up just as risky as any and all potential downsides of coming out.But I am more pessimistic in my assessment of risks to the UK under the Superstate scenario. I think Andrew Lilico has underestimated the consequences - I think it will lead to more than just indifference.  The EU elite who reside at the core of the Euro/Schengen club will push and use their influence to frogmarch all remaining EU states to join both so that the Finance Ministry and a Universal Income tax and central bank replaces our Bank of England and HM Treasury which will naturally need to be disbanded.  The Monarchy will also become irrelevant for obvious reasons.The EU will have no tolerance for a reluctant laggard they feel they are dragging along kicking and screaming.  We will be as left out as if we voted out until we are forced in the full federalism which means we become a county of the EU so in effect the palace of Westminster becomes irrelevant as well.  And ultimately our armed forces and nuclear deterrent are no longer answerable to the MoD or the Queen.Realistically you can only vote IN if you are full blown EU Federalist and there are very very few of them in this country (thank God) on either side of the political divide.  And what you must NOT do is vote preferring to be out but so worried by consequences of it that you are coerced into reluctantly voting IN because as soon as you do that the above process is already underway and it's a non-stop high speed journey to the end of the line which is a United States of Europe, although very left wing hence the nickname EUSSR by many bloggers on this site.</comment>

<comment>Cameron has just insisted on the live feed that upon a Brexit there will be no second chance and he will start negotiations to leave straight away.Good. But I believe he will be in for a big shock as it won't be him doing the negotiating.Re the ever increasing primacy of the EU institutions that you mention.Why do you think we have a canadian Governor of the B of E :)</comment>

<comment>Canadian - Jewish</comment>

<comment>"the UK has no appetite whatever for further political integration."This, combined with the imperial ambitions of the EU, should make it clear to every thinking voter why we simply cannot remain in the EU. If we want to stay we must integrate fully, including Schengen and the euro - peripheral membership carries no advantages but many disadvantages compared with being an independent nation, as partly outlined in the article.</comment>

<comment>I'm a passionate Brexit man but agree in full and have stated the same myself many times.Only the other day I drew the analogy of the golfer paying full fees but only being allowed to play mid week.</comment>

<comment>Didn't someone once say "I have no further territorial demands". Just before he invaded Poland.</comment>

<comment>Yes. I don't think most of those promoting the EU are necessarily in bad faith. I think some are but most are ignorant and/or have more or less openly stated agendas such as promoting the conditions of the ruling bureaucracy at the cost of the European populations.I think there are more malevolent forces in play towards the top of the EU pyramid, following hidden agendas promoting globalisation, limiting and bypassing democracy, empire-building, etc.</comment>

<comment>Old saying,"A fish rots from the head down".</comment>

<comment>Bit like his pact with the Russians that was meant to prevent an invasion of Russia as well as carving up Poland by the back door.The imperial ambitions of the EU make Hitler look like a beginner.</comment>

<comment>He was a beginner but his followers learned from their mistakehttp://www.eu-facts.org/en/bac...</comment>

<comment>Dave's new approach to the referendum seems to be "vote remain, or the kitten gets it". Not a very appealing argument, but it might work with some people.</comment>

<comment>Very funny, reminds me of the time of the Jeremy Thorpe/Norman Scott affair when a slogan was put around saying "Vote Liberal or we'll shoot your dog!"This is for those of a certain age!</comment>

<comment>Could make a good bumper sticker?</comment>

<comment>and a portent of a future EU in its attitude to Britain staying out of Euro, Schengen and full blown federalism one might add!!</comment>

<comment>Very funny!</comment>

<comment>I had in mind a piglet, but a kitten would appeal to more people.</comment>

<comment>A nice, cute fluffy one!</comment>

<comment>Piglet in blankets?</comment>

<comment>Combine the two! Give the kitten pink fur and a curly tail!</comment>

<comment>The scenario where the harmonised (silly propaganda word) states of the Euro joined more fully together is just not realistic. Greece and Germany working together? All these options assume that those EU laws are strictly followed. We have already seen that it's usually only the UK and Northern countries that pay attention to EU laws.  Others ignore them. The southern states particularly.Recently Mrs Merkel ditched EU law. Hungary and other countries also are doing what they feel like doing.So the EU CANNOT work!</comment>

<comment>Others (France, Germany, Italy) ignore them because the are ALLOWED  to ignore them.  The EU displays favouritism to some Member States over others in how much they turn a blind eye to this or that.We are on the wrong side of that and that is one of the major reasons I am voting OUT</comment>

<comment>Good. I agree.</comment>

<comment>Economic damage?The EU is the land of the double-Irish, the double-dutch, the corporate dreamland where limitless employees fight for every job allowing wages and salaries to be depressed.The EU is the land where countries like Greece are given billions to squander and then put in economic prison when the coffers run dry.Economic damage indeed!</comment>

<comment>Pure Corbyonmics if you ask me.  I am surprised he is not championing this wholeheartedly</comment>

<comment>The real crisis is the replacement of the peoples of Europe.In 2008, Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, published a report stating that Britain and other EU states will “need” a net gain of some 100 million immigrant workers between them by 2050 to make up for the “demographic decline” due to falling birth rates across Europe, since not all immigrants become economically active.www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs...</comment>

<comment>well thank God I won't be alive then that's all I can say</comment>

<comment>So, to sum up, we had better stay in and integrate fully, just in case the EU blows up. Great argument. It's like your spouse saying you had better stay, otherwise she'll kill you both.</comment>

<comment>The article does make some interesting points, but I don't think Leave supporters can dismiss the threat of economic damage in the event of Brexit, as George Osborne said today, very lightly. That is really the central argument here.</comment>

<comment>'Economic damage' to whom? If you mean the UK, then of course there will be some damage, simply on the basis that the UK would have to renegotiate FTAs and foreign investment would be hit in the first instance. Even then, the worse scenario is the UK having to pay to WTO-limited tariffs, which are only a few percent on average, and so probably less that our current membership fees - not to mention that EU exporters would be hit far worse in a tariff war. The bigger uncertainty is in the financial services sector, but as we know the EU has been desperately trying to wrest control of that from the UK for decades, so it can impose its Tobin Taxes. Personally, I feel the financiers will do what is best for themselves. If they want to up sticks and more to Frankfurt and face greater regulation and higher taxes, that's fine with me.</comment>

<comment>50% youth unemployment in Greece and other Southern states. The results of EU membership.</comment>

<comment>I think Osborne was talking about immediate consequences of sterling collapsing in value or a stock market crash in the event of a Leave vote.</comment>

<comment>I think the UK will get off considerably more lightly than the rest of the EU, which will collapse shortly after Brexit.</comment>

<comment>'Would' collapse after Brexit - trouble is Brexit is not going to happen.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't bet on it. The odds are shortening daily.</comment>

<comment>Possibly, but when it comes to the crunch the majority of people will vote to stay</comment>

<comment>You may well be right. Dave has form for scaring people into voting his way. Trouble is, they live to regret it afterwards.</comment>

<comment>The skulduggery that Despicable Dave and his chums are indulging in tells me they don't really have a good political let alone an economic case for staying in the EU.Instead they have Project Fear.If you Brits leave then you will be over run by ISIS.The sky will fall on your heads (by Toutatis)Your City of London will be shut out of Europe and will be flooded on the next high tide.Scotland will leave you.You will have no jobs as all your FTSE firms belong to us.Your Navy will sink.Your planes will crash.And you will run out of Calvados. etc etc.It will be a disaster of biblical proportions.So you must vote to stay in the EU.  Or else.Alternatively, you can vote L E A V E and help to save us Europeans from the monster created by the faceless unaccountable technokleptocrats in Brussels and Strasbourg.  If you don't go they will know for sure that nothing can stop them and they can do whatever they like.</comment>

<comment>Andrew lilico doesn't point out that the eurozone is only 19 states now but in the timeframe of the Five Presidents' Report of completing economic and monetary union it would become all 28 EU member states except UK and Denmark, plus the next accession states, Bosnia, Albania, Ukraine, Turkey et al. Neither does he point out that the intention is as soon as practicable after achieving that goal, the Federal State of Europe is to be founded on those economically and monetarily united states. Britain would be a mere colony of a foreign empire state</comment>

<comment>We already are.</comment>

<comment>No we're not.</comment>

<comment>The centre is at Brussels and we must do as we are told.So yes we are. We can't make a move without their permission.</comment>

<comment>Yes we can. Just not enough moves. We are not a colony yet, though we will be if we don't vote Out.</comment>

<comment>If we vote Remain ,then as "Good Europeans"we will eventually join the eurozone with all of its problems.Cameron doesn't talk about that scenario only scare stories about Brexit.He obviously doesn't relish the prospect of having to actually govern the UK, instead of rubber stamping EU directives.</comment>

<comment>D. Cameron has already said, he won't be leader of the Conservative Party for the next election.</comment>

<comment>He's not leader of a Conservative party now.</comment>

<comment>He'd have to think if he really wanted to govern.And he didn't study hard subjects like thinking when he was trashing restaurants with his mates.</comment>

<comment>One only has to look at arrogant manner in which the Greeks have been treated by the European Commission driven by Germany, the way that the Italians were treated even to the extent of having an EU technocrat appointed effectively as Prime Minister and the high-handed way that countries have been told to "try again" when referenda have produced the wrong result for the EU. Why on earth would it be any different in our case should we ever get into trouble and have to rely on the EU, especially Germany.I would prefer to take my chances alone. I have great faith in my fellow Brits with all our faults. History is on our side. We have proven beyond any doubt that we can thrive in the world given our native abilities and the freedom to apply them.I am much more afraid of the risks of staying in the European Union than the risks of leaving and relying upon ourselves.</comment>

<comment>I watch the UK from afar - somewhat perplexed.  You spent hundreds of years fending off Europe, remaining independent from it, developing a system of laws and government that the Europeans never quite got right.  And despite this, here you are, half of you intent upon throwing it all away, led by pink blanc mange.  If you remain, Europe, the French and the Germans, will have you where they always wanted you.  Without a shot fired, you'll be just one of the mob - a bit like where Toad would be if he'd been foolish enough to decide to throw his lot in with the stoats and the weasels upon their takeover of Toad Hall.</comment>

<comment>Yes, but after all those years even the Trojans lost their senses and brought in the Trojan Horse left by the Greeks.And our leaders not only dragged it in through our doors, they paid for it to be built.The Norwegians had a word for such leaders, Quisling.Every country had and has its own class of traitor.</comment>

<comment>"Migrants attempt to hang themselves in the centre of Athens"Headline on DT website.Greece issues international appeal for more ropes to be sent.</comment>

<comment>Yes, that didn't look like a very convincing attempt, did it?!</comment>

<comment>Expansion!! How can you not mention expansion? Albania, Macedonia, Serbia, Bosnia and Turkey all set to join! Another 100million who'll have access to our jobs market, NHS, housing and schools! Another 5 countries who'll need bankrolling by the EU!This is the biggest threat to the UK and everyone's way of life! Wake up people, there is no status quo!</comment>

<comment>Perhaps we had better get a cast-iron guarantee from Cameron that we won't  have to support them, either by paying increasing EU contributions or taking in more migrants?Oh hang on, aren't there reports that the the EU are holding off announcing yet another huge budget increase and more HR legislation to stop us deporting foreign criminals until after the referendum?</comment>

<comment>All these countries keen to join!Yet no country who would be a net contributor has shown any wish to join.Our politicians have been outflanked and fooled by the Europeans.</comment>

<comment>Lets call it the Schenanigan Area. If it rows on to Ever Closer Union, with the UK positioned as in the above cartoon, we will have all the disadvantages of being tied to a drowning man without any effective way of influencing its shenanigans.</comment>

<comment>wrongIceland abides by Free Movement rules, even.NEXT.</comment>

<comment>How many EU migrants are in Iceland? Working, that is, not on holiday.</comment>

<comment>Independence and free trade.No to the closed market of the EU.We can trade with the world instead of being forced to import from them.</comment>

<comment>So Andrew verified is wrong isn't he?</comment>

<comment>Iceland was never a member of the EU. They applied but withdrew their application part way through the process. They are members of the EEA which has the 'four freedoms'.The UK is big enough not to need the EEA or EFTA.</comment>

<comment>Yet free movement of labour legislation applies to nationals of Iceland and vice versa. So Iceland is not the right example to choose since the entire discussion hinges around free labour movement.</comment>

<comment>I'm inclined to think we'd actually get a mixture of the first and third scenario.  It would start with a partial collapse, perhaps sparked by a debt crisis somewhere, perhaps by civil unrest caused by the migrant influx.  That would then roll into a much more authoritarian superstate being established "to restore order", with the EU much more in charge and national governments reduced to an irrelevance.</comment>

<comment>Indeed, but that totalitarian state would only be an interim position. Too many of the citizens it would attempt to control have personal experience of throwing off the chains of a dictatorship. The memories of knocking down The Wall and overruning the borders between state control and freedom would mean the €USSR wouldnt last long.</comment>

<comment>"Civil unrest caused by the migrant influx" seems very likely. The EU was created as an attempt to prevent any further wars in Europe after the disasters of the two world wars. Would it not be a bitter-sweet irony if the EU's open borders policy and its failure to deal with the influx of third world migrants led to the very situation it was supposed to prevent, namely civil war in Europe? The heads of the army in both Switzerland and Sweden have recently alerted those under their command to prepare for war in Europe which they see as being likely given the chaos that now exists.</comment>

<comment>Yes, a much more authoritarian superstate will need an European Army to control the peasantry.Who suggested an European Army?Mr D. Cameron, that's who!</comment>

<comment>Hey Janet - I have an idea. You could create an atmosphere of social unrest as a reason to deploy it.</comment>

<comment>She will not have to create it; the ingredients are already there,</comment>

<comment>I do wonder sometimes. People forget, France is still under a state of emergency.Us soon.</comment>

<comment>Which is why he has been running our own armed forces down.</comment>

<comment>Methinks Andrew is mistaken about 60% chance of a central superstate.  Such a thing could not be achieved with triggering referenda in several Eurozone countries.  The plausible scenario, whether we are in or out, is muddle on through until a seismic event causes the entire top-heavy structure to collapse upon itself.  We need to vote LEAVE because all the above options are dangerous and they will be significantly more dangerous if we choose to remain.</comment>

<comment>When the €Uroscum think it is their duty to ignore what the citizens think (or vote for) I dont give much chance for a referendum or two stopping the onward march of totalitarian government.</comment>

<comment>The scenarios are kind of irrelevant today, though their consequences wouldn't be.Both sides of the argument deal with change to the UK whatever scenario transpires - and there will be positive and negatives for either result.So, the referendum question really amounts to this:Do you wish the change to Britain that will follow the referendum to be defined, controlled, managed and implemented by British politicians voted for by a British electorate?orDo you wish the change to Britain that will follow the referendum to be defined, controlled, managed and implemented by mostly foreign, appointed commissioners and officials voted for by no-one?</comment>

<comment>For goodness sake. It's clear that even committed Eurosops like Cameron support moves to put the UK on a diverging path within the EU. If we stay there will be endless, protracted arguments, bitterness and antagonism towards us by the vast majority of the other 27 countries who begrudge our 'privileged' position. Much better to be out, free of the red tape, the lethargy, inefficiency and bureaucracy that dogs this failed, bumbling institution! You can guarantee others will follow.If you want a really good appraisal of how continued membership adversely affects our vital industries look here:Johnredwoodsdiary.com</comment>

<comment>People ask about the vision for Britain outside the EU.I would to focus on two things however: vision and democracy.Mr Cameron has said he has campaigned for Britain in areformed EU. Well the Britain many of us believe in doesn’t just fight foritself, it fights for those who cannot defend themselves from larger, morepowerful aggressors.Many of us must feel uneasy, if not angry, at the EU’sbattering of Switzerland’s democratic choices, at the EU’s forcing of freemovement on Norway in return for trade, at the demands for tribute towards atrillion-euro budget, at the expansionist policy that triggers civil war inUkraine and pokes the Russian bear, and finally at the threats of retributionfor those who would dare to leave its ever-closer embrace. We are amongstcompany that is not benevolent, and politicians who not friends.In the two years following Brexit I want to see the UK takea lead as a counterweight against the expansionist EU. I want the UK to speaknot just for itself, but to become the shield an defender of Iceland, Norway,Greenland and Switzerland who are battered into submission by a bullying EUCommission who make the policies that the people want impossible to implement.It has been said that the British are good in attack, but unbeatable indefence. And so we should defend.And it is this Commission that acts as the biggest threat topeace in the EU. It is a threat more profound than that of terrorism or theeconomic ineptitude that it has overseen. It is the threat that sees thepopulations of EU states begin to lose faith in their democratic institutions.It is the threat that sees the rise of extreme politics and insurgencies that arebeing formed through the failure of democratic representation and the mechanicsof justice.And so we see UK politicians, supposedly the representativesof the UK, nodding along to empty speeches extolling the virtues of powercentralisation and the promoting of a legislative judiciary that can overruletheir own lawmaking, their own voices, and the voices of their constituents.For the legitimacy of government is failing, and it is beingshored up by more power being removed from the demos and lodged with anoligarchy who is not accountable to any electorate. Democracy is dying; accountabilityis dying, and the majority of our representatives sit in mute acceptance orambivalence of the devastating danger this brings to peace.</comment>

<comment>Well said.</comment>

<comment>Likelihood that assorted eurojacks-in-office will voluntarily give up their vainglorious ambitions = zero.</comment>

<comment>We must vote LEAVE, Thursday 23rd June. This morning, the £ has dropped again significantly ; I have suspicions this is a warning shot across our bows that to leave will mean Britain's economy sinking like a stone, we have to resist these attempts to cajole us into staying in the ghastly organisation which is destroying our nationhood.</comment>

<comment>The pound actually strengthened today and by mid morning was up around 75 cents against both the euro and the dollar.This may have had something to do with the Lloyd's bank statement and the comments from Owen and Howard.George Osborne then made another statement of fear concerning Brexit and the pound lost all of today's gains but has since clawed them back trading slightly firmer against both the euro and the dollar.</comment>

<comment>The drop in the £ is being painted as a problem caused by the referendum. There are more issues at play that are not being reported. Tuesdays drop was caused by the BoE indicating it may cut interest rates or start QE again - but not reported!https://www.poundsterlinglive....</comment>

<comment>Methinks the £ is down at least partly because desperate Eurozone officials, and possibly our own treasury, are selling sterling and buying Euros in order to keep the Euro up.</comment>

<comment>We're seeing a 'British Spring.'Unlike the 'Arab Spring' (which replaced corrupt Arab dictators with corrupt Arab chaos) the British Spring will replace corrupt EU dictators with genuine British sovereignty, prosperity, law and order.It's getting warmer, folks.</comment>

<comment>Hope you're right but we won't know until Friday 24th June.</comment>

<comment>"Ever closer union." It never ceases to amaze me how many people don't get the meaning of those three words.</comment>

<comment>One among several problems in deciding what they mean is that those are just the formal terms used in the English version of the treaties. The exact meaning of the equivalent terms in some European languages is subtly but crucially different, with varying degrees of rigidity or flexibility depending on the approximate synonyms for "closer" and "union" chosen by the translators.Of course, this is just another reminder that trying to develop a single state based on a single body of constitutional law that will work harmoniously for people speaking dozens of different languages is very obviously a fool's errand.Unfortunately Europe is a ship of fools.</comment>

<comment>Don't they. Wow.I thought we had a guarantee this would not apply to Britain.</comment>

<comment>Do you do stand up comedy as well?</comment>

<comment>Moved.</comment>

<comment>you believe this "guarantee"  ??  more fool you ..</comment>

<comment>Utterly meaningless.  The EU uses the court of Human Rights and various other methods to advance its agenda.</comment>

<comment>The so called guarantee is meaningless. The EU Parliament don't even vote on it until after the referendum.</comment>

<comment>Moved</comment>

<comment>Moved</comment>

<comment>It would almost certainly be rendered useless in "discussions", amendments and workarounds.They are not going to change the fundamental tenets. They have actually said so.</comment>

<comment>Cameron asserted otherwise. Is he lying?</comment>

<comment>Either Cameron is lying or Schulz. Read the article and take your pick. Cameron says it is legally binding - Schulz says it isn't. Someone is telling porkies.http://www.independent.co.uk/n...</comment>

<comment>The Independent is Russian-owned and now closing down, for obvious reasons.</comment>

<comment>I think you'll find that Schulz made that statement on film...and it's not just in the Independent.</comment>

<comment>Nope.</comment>

<comment>How do you know?</comment>

<comment>How do you know he is?If he was lying, what does that mean for this Banana Republic?</comment>

<comment>Well it's either Cameron or Schulz. One of them is lying.Read this article:http://www.independent.co.uk/n...</comment>

<comment>I think he is.</comment>

<comment>You know what to do then don't you. The Prime Minister of Britain is lying to you and you are powerless?I want to see you demonstrating on the streets of Britain, not posting nonsense online.</comment>

<comment>On the issue of whether the agreements are cast in stone or can be overturned, Gove is right.  If you doubt this read some history and in particular how the ECJ foisted the Working Time Directive on us despite the opt out from the social chapter negotiated by the then PM.</comment>

<comment>Everything can be overturned. there is nothing that cannot be overturned. If in doubt, you go to war when things are overturned. So what's your point?</comment>

<comment>The point is that Cameron said it was legally binding and Schulz said it isn't. Can you grasp that? It's very straightforward.</comment>

<comment>We need this in Cyrillic, Dave. I can't understand any of it 'as is'.</comment>

<comment>lol - so I have a perfectly valid opinion and you call it nonsense. Says a lot about you.I think Cameron is lying, as he has lied in the past. He has a record of lying rather like his hero Blair.Everyone knows it and very few people believe a word Cameron says. The EU is pulling his strings yet he pretends to be slightly euro sceptic. What a joke the man is - and I voted for him!</comment>

<comment>WE call it nonsense. You are not on the streets as were the people in Ukraine. So are YOU lying?</comment>

<comment>lol - you really need to get off your high horse kid. I have no idea why you are now talking about Ukraine - you really are mixed up and confused.Either Cameron or Schulz is lying - which is it? Let me know when you've had time to digest the facts.http://www.independent.co.uk/n...</comment>

<comment>I think Cameron is lying. So tell us ....WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?PS. LOL</comment>

<comment>Oh dear - you really need to grow up. One of your fellow EU supporters asked above if Cameron was lying. I said I thought he was, simple. That is because Cameron says his deal is legally binding and Schulz says it isn't. Who do you think is lying? Or do you just ignore certain issues that mess with your agenda?I'll tell you what I am going to do about it - vote OUT.So hopefully that will put an end to your childish tirade.</comment>

<comment>Russians would say Cameron's lying lying lying.Who else would, apart from Putin's guard?</comment>

<comment>BINGO</comment>

<comment>Grow up.</comment>

<comment>Done that, soldier. I spot the enemy a mile off.</comment>

<comment>Now what are you going on about?</comment>

<comment>Russians? Who mentioned them?Who do you think is lying? Cameron or Schulz?</comment>

<comment>Russians are lying. Are you Russian? You write as if you were.</comment>

<comment>I'm English. Please explain how I write as a Russian.Incidentally, I'm not sure whether you are trolling for the EU or for Cameron, but most people I know, and come across with my work, think the latter is lying. I'm not alone but it seems that you are.</comment>

<comment>No answer. Meaning?</comment>

<comment>My message is below you idiot.</comment>

<comment>All you have is insults, Ruskie boy.</comment>

<comment>I think you'll find it is you and the 2 other Cameron trolls who have been insulting me.Just read the thread mate and do us all a favour.When you give insults you get insults.</comment>

<comment>Why and how is 'a guarantee' meaningless?A guarantee from Russia is meaningless, a guarantee given from partners is not meaningless.</comment>

<comment>You obviously haven't looked at the history of the EU. Any lie to keep the project on track.</comment>

<comment>I'd sooner trust Russia.</comment>

<comment>Ever heard the expression "cast-iron guarantee" spoken recently? Your own Prime Minister's guarantees are meaningless. What does that tell you ?</comment>

<comment>No if's, No But's</comment>

<comment>Because closer union means pooling sovereignty.  Eventually you will end up with a de facto state if the commitment means anything.  The other EZ staes are committed to this.  Once you have have facto European state they are not going to pay any attention to what we say about how they administer their own affairs, in the same way we pay no attention to Iceland when we administer our affairs. In other words they will not be interested in what we say.  I have some sympathy for the 'remain' position but I don't see how you get around this.  we stay, we do not integrate with the rest in which case what is point as we will be increasingly marginalised anyway?</comment>

<comment>Partners? I don't see those unelected bureaucrats in Brussels as partners. They are a dishonest, deceptive bunch of ideologues who will perpetuate myths in order to keep their destructive social engineering experiment on the road. Evil.</comment>

<comment>Partners. Yes. It's a simple word everyone understands.</comment>

<comment>I don't think Dave232 does. Might have to translate your post and write it in Cyrillic.</comment>

<comment>Oh yes I do. I have a lovely one thanks.Pip, pip</comment>

<comment>You've been found out, soldier.</comment>

<comment>Found out for what you muppet (not an insult but a fact!).Pip  pip matey</comment>

<comment>A guarantee from Cameron is worthless.He guaranteed to reduce immigration to tens of thousands. 'No ifs, no but's.' But he failed.He promised to limit the amount a person would have to contribute to care in old age to £80,000, but, after he had secured votes on that promise in the 2015 election he scrapped the undertaking.Cameron's word is a worthless currency.</comment>

<comment>He is the elected Prime Minister of Britain. Get over it.</comment>

<comment>He's not my prime minister!</comment>

<comment>The agreement was by Heads of Government States not the European Council therefore not ratified in Treaties. Parties cannot agree something for another party that is not present therefore agreement is invalid. If it wasn't invalid by this it would by the fact that some countries that agreed have national elections between now and likely Treaty change therefore any new state head could overturn it again not making it binding. It's all fudge and most are falling for it. But worse still Cameron is now playing fast with democracy by not allowing equal access to each camp to Civil Service representation. We are already living in dictatorship under this man.http://www.eureferendum.com/bl...Vote Leave for: Control, Democracy and Identity</comment>

<comment>There's only one meaningful guarantee that comes from the EU. More EU.</comment>
