<comment>if there's any politician in the world with whom I want to disagree it's David Owen.A truly dreadful, stupid, vain man.Vote REMAIN.</comment>

<comment>If there is a cogent argument for staying in the EU there, I'm damned if I can discern it.</comment>

<comment>Then you should consult plmungtrvcds, below, who has changed his mind because of it.</comment>

<comment>Irony is clearly lost on you.</comment>

<comment>Or perhaps you?Bazinga!!</comment>

<comment>Yawns.</comment>

<comment>Well urgued, I think you just swung the debate.</comment>

<comment>Well, you know, I though it was pretty persuasive.We may as well pack it in now.</comment>

<comment>He is an educated professional but we should ignore hime because you dont like him.  I think you are still fighting class war or something.</comment>

<comment>No, he's a dreadful, vain man, who deserted the Labour Party because he thought that the swing to left was the end of his front-bench career.He's as self-serving and hollow as Nick Clegg.</comment>

<comment>He reminds me of Blair Miliband  Kinnock and Smith</comment>

<comment>While we seem to have to go through a long process to leave, Greece is being kicked out in short order, is the reason that they can make no more money out of Greece?</comment>

<comment>Calais 'Jungle' training camp to be demolished today, apparently.</comment>

<comment>If there isa problem demolishing this dump, ask the Israeli's to do it !</comment>

<comment>Except the Mosque Church and medical/communication centres built by volunteer "aid" workers.</comment>

<comment>And Jude Law.</comment>

<comment>He built the Mosque?Or are they demolishing him?</comment>

<comment>If I rock up in their town and pitch a tent on their lawn they would call the police, If I scream allah akbar and say I am an orphan they build me a mosque and a house.</comment>

<comment>There are times in life when one simply must fight for one's beliefs and other times when one just has to face realities and surrender onself to the tender mercies of those who know best.Such a moment arose in the life of that poor patient in a Swedish hospital who, thought to be beyond saving and oblivious to his surroundings, became the subject of discussion for his doctors.Which organs should they take first? Were his kidneys functional?How quickly could they cut out his heart?He heard every word yet was powerless to utter a whimper or even shed a tear of desperation.Now there I go again, wittering on about things that interest no one when you'd dearly like me to explain the negotiating options for the UK should it be reckless enough to vote for a Brexit.</comment>

<comment>Hope you`ve got a big hat.</comment>

<comment>No, we'd just dearly like you to go away and drivel elsewhere</comment>

<comment>Shouldn't you be in the office spending other people's money?</comment>

<comment>Oh don't worry, I have a whole directorate to take care of that for me.</comment>

<comment>ooh herman you're so butchman kisses :o)</comment>

<comment>The titanic analogy is a good one. Get out before it sinks.</comment>

<comment>I am much heartened by the interview I heard Howard give this morning on the Radio 4, Today programme and by the Fact that the good Dr Owen now also has see the light.   Sadly, and good as it is, that still leaves those of us who want us out of the EU pushing water up hill.   Cameron and Osborne know that the one big thing that will swing it either way is the economy.  There are many in this country now able to vote in this referendum who have never known anything different and believe the bull being peddled that we cannot live without it.  These are people whose vote will have a major impact on the result and it is hard to see, given the propaganda being unleashed about the economy and security (I am being kind, they are actually bare faced lies) how we can turn that around.  Someone needs to be on Cameron and Osborne's case, every time they open their mouths, with the counter arguments, or truth as I like to call it.   The OUT case needs to be put firmly, accurately, consistently and confidently if this is to change.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps the easiest thing to point out to George Osborne is that if he is really concerned about the nation's economy he wouldn't have doubled the national debt and presided over a housing bubble that is bound to correct leaving many up a gum tree.  This is potentially far more damaging than leaving the EU.</comment>

<comment>Cameron and Osborne seem very biased.They must be hiding something.</comment>

<comment>How often over the past 20 years have the auditors signed off the EU's accounts..?</comment>

<comment>Three hundred and four.</comment>

<comment>The EU court auditors have failed EU accounts in the last 20 years 100% of the time. The last audit showed that £100bn had gone missing - by the EU's own admission. The reasons were clear - through misdirected funds, errors, fraud and corruption.</comment>

<comment>They have been signed off but they have always had a qualification meaning that they have never gained a clean audit report as many know it.</comment>

<comment>The usual response to that is that they are signed off every year - by the internal auditors.  They have never been signed off, as far a I recall, by an independent external auditor.   In fact, I think I might be right in saying that the last internal auditor, a Scandinavian lady I think, to question the EU accounts was fired by one Neil Kinnock!</comment>

<comment>You are correct. Her name was Marta Andreasen and Kinnock behaved scandalously toward her.</comment>

<comment>No public auditor in his right mind would go anywhere near those accounts.</comment>

<comment>Not unless he had the fraud squad with him.</comment>

<comment>I believe it depends whether you mean the internal auditors or the external auditors</comment>

<comment>The EU is to everyday life what FIFA is to football, look at the charade they are going through with "elections" and "reform"</comment>

<comment>The EU is a disaster that is making us poorer, unhappier, more regulated, less secure and less free every single day. However: "...Cameron risks alienating voters by insulting their intelligence...." most people - thanks to decades of deliberate deceit by the media, especially the BBC do not understand the scale and intrusion of the EU. Cameron therefore *can* insult their intelligence because, as regards matters EU they are just not told the truth.Cameron is relying upon this fact to ensure he wins because he sure as hell couldn't were he to tell the truth about the corrupt, useless, interfering, incompetent, pointless, expensive irrelevance that is the EU.</comment>

<comment>This is spot on. Most outers know quite a lot about the EU, most (certainly not all, but most) inners are poorly informed.</comment>

<comment>I am extremely pro-Europe.  This why I say we must not just exit, but we must bring the whole undemocratic, elitist, evil, underhanded, misbegotten, European Union down.</comment>

<comment>Yes. I'm weary of the stay campaigners allowed to go on about the risks of leaving Europe.We will never leave Europe.......but many of us do wish to leave the EU, which is entirely different.This message must be rammed home.</comment>

<comment>Taking those claims in turn, UK has much worse democracy than EU. I mp for 3.8 million voters; safe seats where the incumbent has to do very little. The weird arrangements where the SNP are the 3rd strongest party and would like their bit of the UK to leave, but stay in the EU. Elitist. If you don't think there is an elitist section in Westminster you need to look more carefully. They won't actually admit it, but they do all know each other, and some of them even went to the same school or university. Evil is difficult. It depends how you define it, but you do need evidence. Have you any? Underhand.I think the UK leads the way here. Do you not think the peerage system gives huge scope for the government of the day to buy favours? Misbegotten. Difficult to argue with that one. It is just an insult really. Sorry, but I think you are misbegotten!</comment>

<comment>We'll best achieve that by leaving.  That'll cause several others to do the same.</comment>

<comment>In the interests of "democracy" the Abbopottamus is trying to get Hartley Brewer "no platformed"</comment>

<comment>That's a mud-wrestling tussle I'd like to see.</comment>

<comment>I just love Hartley Brewer ripping Abbott to pieces, it happens every time.</comment>

<comment>If last nights BBC Question Time is anything to go by we are gradually leaning towards a Brexit.The 3 non politicians on the panel,as well as the majority of the audience,ran rings around the two token europhile 'bought'Con & Lab politicians,Truss and Abbott.Abbott thinks it is still 2015 and Truss dodged question after question.</comment>

<comment>I firmly believe Liz Truss does not believe a word she says. She is just parroting the Cameron line. I tweeted her and said so adding that one day she will be ashamed of what she doing.</comment>

<comment>"This week" was even funnier, Portillo was just laughing at the Labour stooges attempts to justify staying in, it got almost painful at times.</comment>

<comment>Always had great respect for David Owen, usually can be relied upon to talk sense, and this is no exception.</comment>

<comment>Agreed - was a huge disappointment a few years back that he seemed to be so pro-EU, I'm very glad it's possible to like him again!</comment>

<comment>I saw a post a couple days ago that said that summed things up for me:"There isn't a single problem in the World that can be solved by having more politicians. So I will be voting to get rid of three pointless presidents of Europe with their minsters and entourages; a parliament that shuffles between two cities every few months for no reason; and a mammoth bureaucracy that spends every minute of every day finding new ways to interfere in our lives. All spending our money freely and without any audited accounting. Its politically, financially and morally bankrupt. I want out"</comment>

<comment>Does the parliament not shuffle between Brussels and Strasbourg, at hideous expense, rather more often than 'every few months'?And there is a reason for this - it's to give the French a sense of importance.  As if they need any help on that front.</comment>

<comment>It is simply them using yet more taxpayers' money because they can, along the same lines that we are funding so called 'foreign aid', it sets a precedence which the punters eventually accept as being normal.That being the unfettered access and use of taxpayers' money without let, hindrance or even consultation.</comment>

<comment>Sir, I am open to constructive correction. If thats true it makes things worse?</comment>

<comment>I believe my comments are substantially correct.  Is the noise I hear your teeth grinding in mounting anger?</comment>

<comment>I have gone to my safe space.</comment>

<comment>Yes. But too many still believe we need to be in the EU, and must be persuaded otherwise. Or the cause will be lost, in a tide of fear, ignorance, and apathy.  The spread of knowledge is the power needed to win.</comment>

<comment>Purely anecdotal, but the people I speak to about the EU are for Out.Thanks to the power of the internet we don't have to take the stuff that Cameron spouts as the truth.</comment>

<comment>A complete layer of government which serves no purpose whatsoever except to cost money.</comment>

<comment>Who needs them?</comment>

<comment>They do.  No-one else.</comment>

<comment>'But Lord Owen points to a more recent example: Ukraine'.Downing Street’s suggestion that the EU has helped to calm the situation in Ukraine is even more laughable. It was the flawed diplomacy of (the 'never elected to anything') Baroness Ashton, the EU’s hapless former foreign affairs spokesman  that helped to stoke the flames of the conflict in the first place. Lady Ashton’s insistence on encouraging Ukraine to forge a closer relationship with the EU put Brussels on a dangerous collision course with Moscow, which has long-regarded Ukraine as being part of Russia’s “near abroad” – those countries that should come under Moscow’s sphere of influence. The result of Lady Ashton’s cack-handed enterprise is that the former Ukrainian province of Crimea has been subjected to a de facto annexation by Russian troops, while Russian-backed militias have laid waste to large tracts of eastern Ukraine. If that’s the way the EU goes about improving European security, then any rational British voter is going to conclude that the most sensible course of action is to leave at the earliest possible opportunity.</comment>

<comment>Apparently Question Time didn't go entirely according to the BBC's plans when the panel got clean-bowled by a young woman favouring Brexit.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new..."Responding to the remarks at the debate in Poole, Dorset, Dianne Abbott went on the defensive about immigrants.She said: “My parents were immigration so the audience will forgive me when I say that I worry about a narrative on immigration that only stresses the negative.” "http://www.express.co.uk/news/...I think she just eloquently stressed the negative about immigration herself.</comment>

<comment>There really isn't any other option: the EU makes us poorer, increases unemployment, floods our towns, ensures faulty medical devices escape checks, controls when our rubbish can be collected and sets our energy , water, farming, fisheries, ecological, manufacturing and transport policies to the resoundingly negative end result. It is a revolting leviathan.We must leave the EU.</comment>

<comment>Why anyone takes notice of this obnoxious woman is baffling.........if anyone is the racist, its her.</comment>

<comment>Abbott was her usual pathetic self.  Some of her rousing rhetoric is now greeted with stony silence, she is a one trick racist card pony.</comment>

<comment>Should that not be 'phoney'?  She's certainly no socialist.</comment>

<comment>In name only.Another adherent of the corrupted principle of 'do as I say, not what I do.'</comment>

<comment>After Question Time last night I dont think I can stand months of seeing labour and Tory MPs united and making absolutely no sense at all.</comment>

<comment>Since the likes of anotherview think the EU is the be all and end all for the UK, here's an example of how competent the EU is in keeping itself secure, from this very paper. And I am assuming that Europhiles care as deeply about our fellow member states as they do about what remains of the notion of the UK. Personally I care about Greece deeply, but find it easier when I think of it as a nation with a proud history, not the most insignificant serfdom within the EU.  Here is what is happening in poor Greece.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...And the EU's answer is to leave them to it.  Well with friends like that within the EU who needs an enema.</comment>

<comment>Even if the United Sates of Europe was a good idea the EU in its current form is very, very bad. Antidemocratic, scandalously corrupt, rife with fraud, ponderous and pedantic, bureaucratic, technocratic, kleptocratic and wholly destructive.</comment>

<comment>Rome wasn't built in a day. Although a number have pointed out my striking resemblance to Gaius Caesar Germanicus don't think we're going to settle for anything so trifling as another Roman Empire.</comment>

<comment>Little soldiers boot, I hear you like partying?</comment>

<comment>You have identified its good points.</comment>

<comment>When Cameron said in serious tones that women could be deported for not speaking English I realised he was a complete buffoon who will say the first thing that comes into his head and believe what he said.</comment>

<comment>not as much of a buffoon as the people who deeply want to believe him, if only to save their jobs - are you reading this Theresa? I am so disappointed in you.</comment>

<comment>I would say in a very serious tone  that foreign  men who unzip should also be deported , whether they speak English or not..Such is my disgust and anger listening to the appalling   frightening  wall to wall coverage given by the media re the court case of  the filthy swine   we have in Britain , sexually abusing youngsters.I SAY... these people should have their Commonwealth citizenship removed.. and their passports torn up... and to hell with European courts.. these people are here on our passports, aren't they?</comment>

<comment>I agree, but what Cameron said was ridiculous, how do you define "good English"</comment>

<comment>There are plenty of English exams available to assess their level...Europe is heaving with people who possess certificates</comment>

<comment>It's like da Inglish wot is goin' daan on da sshtreet innit, daaan banglatown bruv.</comment>

<comment>Castrate and then deport</comment>

<comment>Stop sodding around.  Just shoot them.</comment>

<comment>I ardently believe the state should never take a life.I would happily advocate a gentle flogging though, say 50 lashes. A day. For , say a decade. After each, rub salt into the wounds to prevent infection. Don't want them dying on us, do we?However let's do the same to those who endorsed it: the Labour councils and chief police officers.</comment>

<comment>Even better, make the human rights lawyers shoot them and then shoot the lawyers.</comment>

<comment>Actually, deport - and then castrate. Why should the British taxpayer foot the bill for these medical procedures?</comment>

<comment>So that we can guarantee that a proper job is done.  There are plenty of vets who can do the job quickly and economically.</comment>

<comment>OK. I accept your point.</comment>

<comment>Thank you. If it relieves the burden on the taxpayer, I have no doubt a voluntary whip round will provide the funding.</comment>

<comment>Isn't that a sign of a congenital liar?</comment>

<comment>Yes.</comment>

<comment>Sadly, very little enters his head.</comment>

<comment>I am a Europhile, that is precisely why I am anti EU.</comment>

<comment>I think that's an excellent point, one which the Brussels Broadcasting Corporation seem to deliberately confuse!</comment>

<comment>Beat me to it. Love Europe, hate the EUSSR. Time for us to rescue our friends from tyranny , again.</comment>

<comment>They are simply not as bigoted as the Europhobes...more well educated, informed circumspect.</comment>

<comment>How long have you called the truth bigotry? Does that assuage the dissonance you labour under?</comment>

<comment>Were I as dim as you, l wouldn't display it for all to see.</comment>

<comment>Have you met someone with an Irrational fear of continents?  Europhobe seems like a very small group of people.</comment>

<comment>Who are you talking about? "They"?</comment>

<comment>So can you provide us with an educated, informed, circumspect argument for curtailing democracy, dissolving the nation state, and sweeping our people away with endless immigration?</comment>

<comment>What is a "Europhobe"?This referendum is about the EU, not the continent</comment>

<comment>I think a Europhobe is somebody who is scared of Europe. Tough being a Europhobe in the UK when it is technically part of Europe. It's nonsense of course, like most insults hurled by the Remain camp.</comment>

<comment>Don't answer this troll.</comment>

<comment>Soubry !!!!!!!!!!!</comment>

<comment>It becomes more evident each day that Cameron has no plausible defence for the EU other than the fact that Britain is already in and it would require some effort on politicians and bureaucrats that they'd rather not make to in order to leave it.They want to stay regardless of whether the EU is a good or a bad thing and in their hearts they clearly think it is the latter because they are constantly demanding that it be reformed in the teeth of EU opposition.If the first casualty of war is truth, the first casualty of any argument about the merits of the EU is logical consistency.Cameron's security argument is thin because it is so obviously invented. He has implied that terrorist intelligence will no longer be shared after Brexit.The citizens of Paris, who have been taught to refer to Londonistan and know first hand about terrorism, will doubtless be happy to learn that vengeful politicians are threatening no longer to exchange terrorist information out of of pique.We know they are shallow and incompetent and care more about protecting EU ideology than they do about the economic wellbeing of their citizens but that they would put lives willfully at risk in pursuit of their quarrels is a new low. I'll rephrase that: an all time low.Some Danish pol or other was warning yesterday about repercussions in Nato. What has Nato got to do with the EU and what would Nato be without Britain which, along with France, has the only European military worth mentioning?Such arguments point to the low intellectual calibre of the current generation of European leaders who gave precedence to welfare and immigration over defence and are now paralysed by the threat from Putin but want to put the blame on Britain for risking their security.Osborne is now more or less saying that staying in Europe is the only grown up option though many question his own claim to adulthood.He and Cameron fear the referendum is slipping away from them but it's entirely due to their own ability to rise to an historic moment with a convincing case that owes more to intellect and political grasp than to spin.</comment>

<comment>Excellent post. I would just add that the more I think about it, the more I see the threat from Putin as a battle for geopolitical supremacy in the former Soviet states like Ukraine, instigated by the avarice and political posturing of the EU, but for which they'd like to blame Putin alone.</comment>

<comment>well said.</comment>

<comment>National Football Teams: There’ll Always Be An England… Unless We Stay In The EU.http://www.breitbart.com/londo...</comment>

<comment>Bl**dy UEFA, imposing their rules on us. We should take our football team home and leave them to it.</comment>

<comment>Its not about UEFA though, is it?</comment>

<comment>How many Englishmen are in the English Football Association X1 anyway?</comment>

<comment>I think XI + substitutes - if you mean the Premier League then the answer is - not enough BUT if we leave the EU clubs are more likely to invest in home-grown talent - improving the standard of the English/ Welsh/ Scottish and Northern Ireland teams.Football's coming home - if we vote LEAVE.</comment>

<comment>Laurent Blanc was right.  The Sub-Saharan African sociobiology will tend to produce a more physically mature 14-year old than the European sociobiology.  The difference is there in the womb, and in the length of gestation.  It doesn't go away.  But it does not mean that genuine footballing talent at 14 years of age resides with the more physically mature.</comment>

<comment>If the powers that be say that once the Filthy Rotherham bunch have finished their  jail sentences  they will be probably be deported, why cannot all the  other  foreign dirty rump scullions who fill our prisons up also be deported now...</comment>

<comment>They won't be deported, they're just saying they will for a few headlines that they're hoping some gullible people will believe.</comment>

<comment>The European Court of Human Rights will stop them being deported.The announcement of their deportation has only been made because there's a referendum coming up and - yet again - the government is pretending to act tough to con voters into believing we somehow have an autonomous right to deport people while still being shackled to the EU.</comment>

<comment>Divest them of their Commonwealth citizenship is another way to do it , surely?</comment>

<comment>They can say any old stuff...nobody will be deported</comment>

<comment>I hope they feed them pork then!</comment>

<comment>Not in a UK prison...where Muslims rule the roost</comment>

<comment>I defer to your experience on this matter.</comment>

<comment>Thank you. I know whereof I speak</comment>

<comment>You are right Michelle, I also have sources of information - the government DARE NOT admit it though!</comment>

<comment>What the 'Leave' campaign need more, is Anna Soubry making the case for 'Stay'.If you thought Currie was a Harpie on steroids, she's a  trapist monk compared to Soubry who is a rent a gob nightmare. Cameron must have been insane to put her in the Cabinet.</comment>

<comment>Yes, she thinks bullying, talking over people and shouting loudly is the way to win an argument. What an awful woman.</comment>

<comment>Is she the one who apparently supports extended Sunday trading when she's shacked up with a director of Morrison's or one of the other big supermarkets?  No possibility of a conflict of interest there then.</comment>

<comment>She is a single mother of two.  So someone liked her once.  Possibly even two people liked her once.</comment>

<comment>She must be a different person in private - to some extent. Because even if she was Sophia Loren's twin sister, if she behaved that way, even a short Breakfast in her company, would be too long.</comment>

<comment>They may have just taken her by surprise.</comment>

<comment>From behind?</comment>

<comment>Reminds me of the dialogue in paternity case where the judge asked the mother to identify the father out of a group of six. You can probably guess the answer...</comment>

<comment>Turkey baster?</comment>

<comment>There are a couple of huge differences ...</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>'David Owen is ...... there I (sic) no reason to take this article seriously.'Is that supposed to be  an 'intelligent' observation? </comment>

<comment>For an Inner, it was.</comment>

<comment>Quoi ?</comment>

<comment>Not from good old Mark - he doesn't do 'intelligent'.</comment>

<comment>He has just criticised mine lower down, thus the reason for my question!I must point out, however, that nowhere in the community rules does it demand intelligence as a prerequisite to joining up to comment here, although admittedly it would appear to help under some circumstances! :-) Good manners are perhaps more important as they do get a mention.</comment>

<comment>Then why are you here boring all of us with your silly little comments?</comment>

<comment>Sadly he's an old twit who was Foreign Secretary and was very pro EU.Shows how the tide shifts.</comment>

<comment>Many years ago Eddie George (Governor of the bank of England) said that "Unemployment in the North was a price worth paying to curb inflation in the South".Suppose the ECB were to say a similar thing. "An increase in the UK subscription is a price worth paying to improve the lot of Turkish unemployed."The aim of the EU is to harmonise everything. This inevitably means that the wealthier countries will suffer a fall in their standard of living as resources are drained from them to 'better' the poorer ones.Do we really want that? If you do  - then vote REMAIN</comment>

<comment>The EU project is mainly about impoverishing EVERY nation state within its grasp. To flood every country with masses of immigrants who can be relied upon to remove any last sense of patriotism and dilute nation identity - so that opposition to central command in Brussels is killed off.WE MUST ALL VOTE TO LEAVE THIS EUROPEAN UNION NIGHTMARE</comment>

<comment>I agree with you. It's institutions and governance follow the USSR model. </comment>

<comment>If there is one thing that is preventing me from Brexiting the elitist undemocratic and unaccountable political nexus of the EU, it is the knowledge that that to do so would leave me in the grasp of the elitist undemocratic and unaccountable political nexus that is the British Government. What a choice. The only saving factor is that come the day of the tumbrels the latter are closer at hand.</comment>

<comment>The UK government may be elitist, but at least we can change it on polling day. What has changed for the Greeks since they voted for anti austerity? Nothing. The Eurozone high command, cannot be removed.</comment>

<comment>At least the electorate get to choose their leaders within the UK.</comment>

<comment>The electorate are allowed to choose between pre selected, shortlisted puppets whose strings are pulled from far beyond the electorate's reach. In some respects, the MEP elections are far more representative than the FPTP fiasco that we call elections.</comment>

<comment>I totally agree with what you say about selection; the whole electoral system needs a major overhaul.  However, as I understand it, MEPs do not get any more say than MPs.  The major decisions are made by unelected people.Why does Angela Merkel dominate the situation?</comment>

<comment>Günther Gruhn from the ECB and the Bundesbank, on the euro, its stability, solutions, currency breakup, budget deficits, bailout loans, Troika, grants, and the differences between the Irish, German and other European peoples.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>At least you can vote the government out - why not do the Scottish thing? they voted in SNP, so vote UKIP. Break the mould.</comment>

<comment>Well, Fraser, if it is only now, that "we should all stop and think", then we fully deserve the third-rate tinpot leaders we have currently. Cameron is clever only insofar as he has realized how indolent and inert the average Joe is because they NEVER stop and think. Like me, they probably believe all of you highly educated, over-privileged and guilt-tripping journos spend all your time doing the thinking for the rest of us.It has been as plain as the nose on your face that the EU has been heading for a socialist dystopian pseudo-dictatorship for more than 15 years now, so yeah, maybe it IS time we all stopped to think.  Personally, I won't be stopping, never stopped before, voting LEAVE, irrespective of the dogmatic propaganda bombs being unleashed on us daily by the Number 2s in Number 10/11.  It is a shameful attack on democracy to belittle, berate, cow and insult the electorate that put you in power.</comment>

<comment>Fraser mentions Federica Mogherini, the current High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, a previous member of the Italian Communist Youth Federation. He did not also mention this particular quote: "Islam holds a place in our Western societies. Islam belongs in Europe. It holds a place in Europe's history, in our culture, in our food and - what matters most - in Europe's present and future. Like it or not, this is the reality... I am not afraid to say that political Islam should be part of the picture."Is this an EU that we really want to be part of? For most other EU countries, they have, within living memory, been ruled by either communist or fascist dictatorships. For them, the EU is democracy. For the UK, it is a travesty of democracy.</comment>

<comment>A very interesting article that reflectsthe dilemma of many in the UK,who (like me) have enjoyed long and happy professional & familialrelationships centred around the EU.  I'd like this to continue, however,for all the reasons listed above, it's becoming harder and harder to persuademyself that voting to stay in the EU is the right thing to do. This"club" is being run by a dysfunctional family of superannuatedpoliticos who having exceeded their shelf life at home have been put outto grass in the generous pastures of EU governance; the status quo isall they have ever known and from inside their cosy Brussels bubble it works justfine for them.  The embarrassing failure to find a quick and effectiveresponse to the current migrant crisis is just the latest example of theirinability (or unwillingness) to deal with the world as it is, rather than howthey would prefer it to be.  Furthermore they seem to be unaware of howmuch reform the EU needs if it is to become fit for purpose in the comingyears.  Perhaps the short, sharp shock of a Brexit will be the wake upcall they so sorely need.</comment>

<comment>"enjoyed long and happy professional & familialrelationships centred around the EU"Or did you mean centred around countries in Europe?  Despite what the In faction would like to think, most exiteers are Europhiles in the true sense of the word.  We just understand that the political organisation known as the EU is not operating in the interests of the European countries but rather to preserve and expand their own unelected bureaucracy.</comment>

<comment>Yes, Brexit is the wake-up call that the EU most definitely needs.We will be doing many other people in Europe a favour - setting off the tremor that would clearly define the the EU's fault lines.</comment>

<comment>With respect that is just abuse, with no evidence. (Media smears and implications don't count as evidence!). You say, "The embarrassing failure to find a quick and effective response to the current migrant crisis is just the latest example of their inability (or unwillingness) to deal with the world as it is, rather than how they would prefer it to be." First of all the problem arises because of wars. That is obvious. Secondly there is a huge humanitarian issue. Thirdly, the question for anyone who criticises as strongly as you is to ask you what your solution would have been?</comment>

<comment>My solution would have been to form an EU coastguard to patrol Italian waters and systematically block any boats found carrying illegal migrants.  These vessels would then be impounded and destroyed.  Passengers on board would either be returned to their point of origin or kept in secure areas until they agreed to provide proof of identity (they all have this on their person or have family in their country of origin that can get duplicates to them). Implementing this system would have nipped people trafficking in the bud long before the Middle East crisis developed.  Instead we now have a well-established network involving criminals from both North Africa and Italy (Mafia, Camorra, N'drangata) who are happily exploiting the situation via a multi-million euro "industry"  that has been left to flourish for years in the midst of EU indifference.</comment>

<comment>Migrant solution:1. All migrants arrested on landing2. All migrants taken to processing centres remote from European mainland3. Any migrant without papers immediately removed to the last safe country 4. Any migrant not from war areas immediately removed to last safe country5. Genuine refugees given limited leave to remain in EU, subject to regular police checks, with the aim of returning them to their origin when safe6. Navy patrols in the migrant seas routes - smuggler's boats sunk, migrants returned to the beach from which the smuggler set off</comment>

<comment>My opinion has nothing to do with media smears (of which there are plenty knocking about on both sides of the divide).  Nor have I been abusive.  The migrant/refugee crisis has been an issue in Italy - a country I'm very familiar with - for nearly 20 years.  Try googling Lampedusa/migrant if you want confirmation of how long boats full of people have been landing on  Italian shores using them as a staging post before penetrating further into Europe in search of more generous treatment.  And for nearly 20 years the EU has kept its head stuck firmly in the sand, mainly, as far as I can tell, because no-one had the first clue of what to do about it.</comment>

<comment>Are your relationships centred round the EU - or around Europe?</comment>

<comment>Both.</comment>

<comment>Is there one single politician in this country with a shred of decency who backs #Bretrayal rather than #Brexit?On the one hand we have the almost offensively honourable such as Mr Owen, Lord Howe and Ms Hoey - on the other Messrs Cameron, Blair, Osborne and Corbyn #NuffSaid</comment>

<comment>The big bus of the EU has 28 drivers in its driving seat. 'Left', say some. 'No, right,' say others. 'Straight on, you fools,' say yet others. Meanwhile, the conductor rings the bell to stop and pick up more passengers. 'Don't stop', say some. 'We're full.'  'We must stop,' say others. 'It's our duty.' 'Rubbish,' say yet others, 'We'll overturn if we take any more.' 'Where the hell are we going?' asks one. 'Who knows?' says another. 'Ask the conductor.' 'This bus is totally unsteerable' says one, 'I'm getting off.' 'You can't' shouts everyone.</comment>

<comment>And this is the group that Cameron thinks makes the UK more secure. Suppose for just one moment that the EU actually had a military force. Can you imagine them ever actually taking a decision to use it?</comment>

<comment>Yes......but only against us :)</comment>

<comment>And they'd lose.</comment>

<comment>Collectively they're incapable of even taking a decision on which end of a rifle to put the bullet in. They're more of a danger to themselves than anyone else.</comment>

<comment>Excellent, spot on!</comment>

<comment>But too subtle for the Europhiles I fear</comment>

<comment>Euphiles, live up to your tag. 😇</comment>

<comment>Sums it up beautifully- and Cameron wants us to have more of this pantomime. To quote; "He is the biggest fool in Christendom"</comment>

<comment>It was "wisest fool in Christendom"...I doubt he qualifies</comment>

<comment>I stand corrected. However he wants us to believe he is wise. I rather think most would say he is foolish. It would surely be better if he kept his mouth shut - then we can only think he a fool.</comment>

<comment>This is why I laugh when it is said that our security is better in the EU, can you imagine Putin sending in the tanks and by the time we had even agreed a date and time for a meeting convenient to all 28 the tanks would be at Calais.</comment>

<comment>Safety and security is not an issue anyway bearing in mind that 911 & 77, Paris etc are all False Flags carried out by Globalist paramilitaries (exotic weapons used in NYC).In Europe GladioA kicked off after WW2 to create conflict and chaos between among many countries not least Italy and communists to heighten the cold war. We`re now well into GladioB, so the EU doesn`t come close to offering any `security` especially not when knowing they`re owned by those same Globalists and are fully au fait with all the fake conflict and attacks anyway.But if people won`t do their homework...</comment>

<comment>Now if only we'd leave the EU all these dratted false flags would stop and the globalists would lose their influence over us.</comment>

<comment>`IRREFUTABLE`, Zero of 6 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>It's certainly irrefutable that you're in serious need of being taken into care.</comment>

<comment>Any well-informed person on the side of a peaceful and prosperous world should be on the side of belonging. Reading through these comments there is very little proper discussion of issues. If a remain supporter quotes a statistic in support the europhobes say it is a lie. Are there any who can argue calmly why going off on our own in a sulk is going to make our world or Europe better? I have met many immigrants from eastern Europe and frankly, apart from being hard-working, intelligent, appreciative of having a job they are NICER than the people writing such vitriol in these columns. And these immigrants are making us wealthier. Studies have shown that but my experience makes me think that the studies underestimate their contribution. A modern economy is enormously interlinked. I have some spending money and I frequently buy on the internet because it is quick and reliable and cheap. I wouldn't buy at all if that was not the case. Again and again a smiling eastern European face appears at the door with my purchase, then hurries away to deliver the next one. A europhobe will go on in that miserable way about the foreigner taking a Brit's job, or keeping his wages down. But the job gets done, and prosperity results. The prosperity should be used to build enough schools hospitals and houses.</comment>

<comment>Well, as long as: You're not you losing your jobYou're not unable to get workYou're not having your pay reducedThere are all those eastern Europeans to give you a good service,...all is fine and dandy, and the people to whom the above has happened can go to hell for being miserable and nasty can they?</comment>

<comment>Who said anything about going off in a sulk? I see zero reasoned argument from you though you used a lot of column inches. If you read the posts regularly you will have picked up literally dozens of reasons to leave the EU. You have none whatsoever for REMAIN other than your condescending generalisations. This has nothing to do with being a "Europhobe". we would all like to see Europe prosper but it will fail to do so while the anti-democratic, anti-competitive, dictatorial, corrupt, unaccountable, wasteful and unfair (look at the internal balance of trade just for an example) EU is allowed to continue. We should leave because even if we are not economically better off, we will be better off in terms of democratically accountable government. We will be a beacon for democracy as opposed to oligarchy. We will open our eyes (as you clearly need to) to global trade. It is ironically you who is a "little European" because you can't see a world beyond this declining trading block.  Immigration: this is not about stopping it, it is about having control over who comes in and on what basis. Is that too difficult for you to understand?</comment>

<comment>"...a smiling eastern European face appears at the door with my purchase..."Funny that. I had one or two of those a while back but in the last year or so all my courier deliveries have featured native British drivers – and this is in the East Midlands, awash with central and eastern Europeans. One of the drivers was probably only just in his 20s. Aren't all our young people supposed to be lazy?Still, if you want to believe that the British are all sat at home watching TV and the entire economy is run by immigrants, who are we to stop you. After all, you are a 'well-informed person'. We bow to your superior mental faculties.</comment>

<comment>I think I am well-informed, because I have spent a lot of time looking up stuff from what I consider reliable sources. It is often hard work. But I have not toured the country checking different locations. I live in a prosperous area in the south of England and I am relaying my experiences. I am interested in your experiences. How do you know the your area is awash with central and eastern Europeans? I keep reading about the immigrant problems but don't actually see them. Perhaps there are more jobs available here so immigrants take them. When I take an elderly relative to hospital or visit someone else I see a huge number of foreigners working away and rather a lot of elderly anglo-saxons being cared for.I read somewhere that the strongest anti immigrant sentiment occurs in the areas where there are the fewest!</comment>

<comment>"How do you know the your area is awash with central and eastern Europeans?"Because I see them every day in my town centre, you damned fool!Dear God...</comment>

<comment>You make a good point but miss the issues altogether.The issue is one of control. Without control, the scale of the migration is in practical terms, infinite with all its inherent difficulties e.g. cultural balance; infrastructure capacity; resources misuse etc etc.We should be able to determine what's best for us whilst offering appropriate support to those requiring our assistance.That means Brexit and through control of our borders, qualify who comes and stays and who leaves fundamentally based on our economic, social and national self interest.</comment>

<comment>In different circumstances I might easily agree with you, but in the present circumstances I see no problem. The people of the EU are by definition and in theory, I admit, culturally similar. There are some aspects of some religions that are in conflict with our principles. That is a genuine problem that we must deal with as a country. If you read the articles that are the fundamental building blocks of the EU they are not principles that anyone here would disagree with. The disagreement comes in their application.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, but after hearing various arguments by politicians over the years I regret that I take very little notice of such stats anymore. However I have a foolproof way of determining if I should vote out or in and that is, Mandelson and Kinnock think the EU is a good idea, so I will vote out.</comment>

<comment>To your first sentence I suggest that you may be basing your opinion on reports of what the politicians have said in answer to aggressive or time restricted interviews on TV or selective reports in the papers. I once read an article by some EU person about transport, many years ago. I thought how sensible the article was. Then I was amazed to find it was by Kinnock. The man had been portrayed for years by the media as a buffoon, and, if they don't like you they can do that. For instance an unflattering photo can work wonders. It is very easy to take a photo when you have just sneezed or coughed and make the victim look ridiculous!.</comment>

<comment>It saves time that way!</comment>

<comment>As ever, there is confusion between Europe and the EU.They are not the same</comment>

<comment>Obfuscation is not the same as confusion. The former is sinister, the latter is idiotic.</comment>

<comment>That is just a standard europhobe answer, claiming we like Europe but not the EU. The thing is the vast majority of mainland Europe like the EU in the sense that they don't want to leave. They criticise it, of course; people always do. One of the many justifications for the EU is that, because people are so antagonistic, (read these columns!) it is better for them to meet up and debate and have meetings with experts, and understanding and compromise start to appear. Not in the case of Farage, I admit. He has set out his stall and has to justify it.</comment>

<comment>I think you will find that over the next several years the EU will become an Orwellian nightmare that we could well do without.Its tightening grip over media,  just one indication how the dark the days will get.For this we are prepared to sacrifice a a couple of  difficult years economically but we see the opportunity of building new trade and business elsewhere with countries that are commercially more dynamic than this constipated bureaucracy.</comment>

<comment>Of course you are entitled to your forecast, but the anti's have been forecasting doom for years, and things are slowly improving, and my forecast is that it will continue.As for the media, I suggest it is tightening its grip over us. If Murdoch takes a position the Sun will reflect it. And that means a lot of voters are lined up. The politicians have to take account of that. It is hardly democracy. One of the reasons the EU is arguably more democratic is that the media do not have the same power over them.In an Orwellian nightmare do you think that Farage would have been allowed to even appear in Brussels, leave alone make the most cringe-making speeches that he has made over there. I have never felt more ashamed of a fellow countryman.</comment>

<comment>I am no Europhobe...as the other residents of this Spanish village will confirm</comment>

<comment>Glad to hear it. Thing is, if you live in mainland Europe but read and believe all the anti EU propaganda in some of our papers you have to take your position. I don't think anyone actually says Europe is full of horrible people. The argument is about the EU set up, and if the ordinary person either hears nothing about it except jokes about straight bananas or insulting and patronising comments. The DT has very little argument/discussion about the real issues.</comment>

<comment>They try to conflate the EU with Europe. Thus if you dislike the EU, you dislike Europe. Then they can call you a RACIST!</comment>

<comment>They also have you believe that the Ukraine is part of "Europe" whereas the truth is the "Five Presidents" (go on Euro anotherview, please name them without Google) would like the Ukraine to become part of their EU empire, and then having provoked the Bear thus by turning the eyes of the Ukraine government Westwards, they wonder why the Russians invaded a territory that is majority ethnic Russian and wants to remain under Russian, not EU influence. Pot kettle black. A personal view, but people should consider what the EU is actually up to in the Ukraine and with its propaganda against Russia. They are dissembling about everything else from Syrian rapists and anti-semites among the immigrants to their annual budget, why would people believe there's only one side to the conflict in Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia. Tweak the bear's tail at your peril. They've learnt nothing in "Europe" nor in the "EU" in centuries.</comment>

<comment>All the Spanish people here say I am not racist.And the people in the Chinese supermarket too.I might still vote LEAVE though...</comment>

<comment>Please do. Your children will thank you in the future!</comment>

<comment>I have none...just Spanish cats, and they offer no opinion</comment>

<comment>Just paws for thought.</comment>

<comment>Another naive and foolish `view`...</comment>

<comment>I think your name is appropriate!</comment>

<comment>You don't have a very high opinion of your fellow countrymen do you!</comment>

<comment>Of many, I do.</comment>

<comment>So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is...fear itself — nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and of vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory.  FDR</comment>

<comment>I am always rather intrigued by the comments of those who say we should move on, the question is move on to what? Surely when they would appear to rubbish the importance of the UK’s stand during the last world war they are overlooking the very reason for why we as a nation resisted. Yes we certainly could not have won without the assistance of America and aided by the intervention of Russia, however at the outcome when we stood alone it was for the freedom of the UK, Europe and democracy.Having lived in France for many years I was very often confronted by the accusation that Britain did not enter into the spirit of things as regards Europe. They seemed not to recall that the very reason for  which we resisted, was for the same ideals that the founding fathers of Europe aspired to.  Probably one of the reasons that they ( the founding fathers) believed it was necessary to create a pan-European Super State was because they did not have enough confidence in individual nations to fully embrace the democratic values to which they aspired. Does the present EU institution represent their ideals, possibly not, as we have seen the gradual creation of a powerful and autocratic institution without electable accountability, which I find difficult to equate to the democratic model for which we have fought and probably theirs. There a many aspects of the EU that I do not appreciate, but ceding sovereignty is amongst the issues that are foremost in my objections. Sovereignty and by token representative democracy is much too important to give away.</comment>

<comment>Agreed, but it seems that the notion of sovereignty is too broad for its importance to be comprehended by those who wish to Remain. They always want the Leave camp not only to justify their position by giving reasons to Leave but to invent on the spot an entire manifesto for how they would seek to improve things after Brexit. While on their side, I see nothing but scaremongering and blatantly laughable claims about security and economic prosperity that we would be giving up if we Leave the EU. It beggars belief that the shamefully inept, non-independent and politicized "rating agencies" are raising their heads above the parapet, only to weaken Sterling. Bring it on! You guys are so dumb that you are actually contributing to UK exports within and outside the EU. Keep it going guys.</comment>

<comment>I agree with much of what you say, but why do you think the EU is turning into a powerful and autocratic institution without electoral accountability? Agreed that is the impression given by our media, but it is misleading, The EU is constantly changing and responding to input from its members. But we are not told about this for obvious reasons.Sovereignty. We can leave. so there is the basic issue resolved. Entering into agreement about safety standards, workers rights, fair trading regulations, is just sensible and has been going on for decades.</comment>

<comment>The media does not give the impression of unaccountability. The "Five Presidents" do it themselves. Unless you don't understand what they are saying to you, you would recognize that in order to have a properly functioning "EU" democracy at a national level goes in the dustbin of history. At least Junckers is honest enough to admit this. You don't seem to have recognized it nor the consequences of ceding national sovereignty. The only other thing I would say is that economics is only part of this debate. And finally, I don't buy the security threat. The EU has shown itself repeatedly incapable of dealing with security issues within and immediately on its own borders and the only reason I believe there has been post-WW2 peace in the West is Nato and our alliance with the US, however uncomfortable it may be to admit the latter.</comment>

<comment>Dear Boris, Nigel and Michael (Gove and Howard)Thank you for explaining your position  regarding the in/out EU decision in June.Can you please explain, in layman’s terms, what exactly will happen if we vote to leave.1)            Assuming we want to continue selling things to Europe would we have to continue following their rules and regulations?I thought so.2)            Would Europe insist on free movement of labour as a condition of future trade, as it has done with Norway and Switzerland?I thought so.3)            Would we have to remain subject to the European Court of Human RightsI thought so.4)            Can you therefore explain any positive change leaving would make to the current status quoI thought not.Yours sincerelyConfused of Pangbourne</comment>

<comment>You expecting them to come on here and answer you?</comment>

<comment>1) - we have to follow rules and regulations in selling to America, China, India and any other market.2) Is negotiable3) No 4) £50 million a day membership fee.</comment>

<comment>Wrong; they will be devastated if they are not able to sell to us and thus we can make new terms in order to allow that......two can play the same rules game, pal.</comment>

<comment>The security gambit was recognised as being just that, Cameron rolling the dice and hoping for a double. See the Con Coughlin article on a "letter" written by an adviser telling us how militarily secure we are and which was then supposedly signed by 13 senior military figures, at least one of whom has asked for his signature to be removed.Look in vain for the author of the letters military qualifications. The best that can be said for him is that he was Lady Ashton's advisor.But unile the economy where there are facts and figures, however abused, security is an objective consideration, one where opinions are more easily influenced or duped.</comment>

<comment>Apart from scare, lie and smear Dave is resorting early on to bribery. The Times reports that Ministers and senior Conservatives who have stayed loyal to David Cameron and supported his EU renegotiation could be rewarded with peerages or other honours. It is not clear if the traditional 30 pieces of silver will be replaced with gold as an extra inducement.One Tory-supporting businessman backing Brexit was allegedly told they could have "anything" to switch sides on the referendum, though they did not specify whether the offer included a peerage. Sadly his reply was not reported as it was unprintable.</comment>

<comment>Your comment sounds like a smear to me!</comment>

<comment>Not comments - fact.</comment>

<comment>If you plan to vote according to personalities, rather than issues.</comment>

<comment>Hello,My name is David Cameron and my aim is to destroy Britain as you know and love it.That is why in the last 12 months alone, I have admitted 650,000 newcomers, 65,000 asylum seekers and have made it easy for illegals to enter the country and remain here forever. i will of course repeat this policy this year and every year during my premiership.Up and down the country, I am being told that my plans are working perfectly as people find they are becoming 'Strangers Where They Live'  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new... , and I am delighted my Defence Minister, Michael Fallon, has told me that our towns and cities are being enrichingly 'swamped with immigrants' http://www.theguardian.com/uk-...As the 'Heir to Blair', I am proud to be continuing the pro immigration policies adopted by my close friends in the Labour Party and to be able to develop such ideas to extinguish 'Britishness' wherever it may be found. That is why I have abolished many of the planning rules in order to easily build huge enrichingly new towns and cities in what was the unnecessary and socially divisive English countryside http://www.dailymail.co.uk/new...I will soon be holding the long awaited confirmation of my views and opinions that Britain should remain an EU member forever and I will personally ensure that the Remain campaign is full of lies and propaganda to ensure this highly desirable outcome thereby wiping the floor with a large blonde haired mop.As you will understand from the foregoing, I am very excited about the forthcoming abolition of Britain and 'Britishness' by the enrichers, and by my friends in the European Union who have assured me that a new name has already been decided for these very small inconsequential islands..They have chosen 'EU Sector North West', which should please be written below your postcode in future or your mail will not be delivered.God Save The President of the EU Commission.Yours sincerelyDavid Cameron</comment>

<comment>Dave Flashman Cameron,'EU Sector North West', once known as Great Britain, is represented by yourself, in the form of Gauleiter Cameron on the world stage...Have most of the voting boxes been already be filled with 'Stay in the EU' votes?  How is that work progressing?</comment>

<comment>Yes, David,  will you be appointed the first Gauleiter?</comment>

<comment>The EU s own migration Commissioner has warned that there are only ten days to avert a huge disaster on immigration. And, in any event, a further one million expected to enter Europe this year. And some here want us to remain in this failed would-be superstate....Madness.</comment>

<comment>The EU's total lack of competence & leadership in the migrant debacle has forced it to call on NATO for help. These inadequacies were evident also in its handling of the Ukraine conflict and the Balkan war before that.The EU would appear a force for bad when it comes to security and managing conflict. in Europe.Would we be safer in?  I think not.</comment>

<comment>Viktor Orban, Hungary's PM told his parliament yesterday that Cameron got nothing from his 'pleadings'. He reassured them that their countrymen would still be able to claim UK benefits, as there has been no change. Yet somehow this is not reported in our MSM. This referendum really is the people v the establishment. But the establishment controls the media!</comment>

<comment>Stop and think because Lord Owen wants out?  Yes, seriously.  Now let's see...  This is the man whose hubris and vanity split two political parties, and who was the author of the disastrous Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia (that role being a good example of the way some politicians get given roles based on their self-esteem, rather than their track-record).And he wants out of the EU. OK, another own goal for Brexiters.</comment>

<comment>Owen says I used to love and ardently support the EU, but it has changed into something I can no longer support. An own goal for Brexit? You live on a different planet to me (and everyone else).</comment>

<comment>Owen was also in favour of armed intervention in Bosnia (the right choice) until he had to actually make a decision, when he backed a disastrous peace plan.  His entire history is one of backing the wrong side in a crunch, even when he was originally right.Anyone who studies his history could work out that whichever direction Owen jumps when the fat hits the fire, is probably the wrong direction. </comment>

<comment>So the decisions on Bosnia were the responsibility of one man? Wow, broad shoulders.</comment>

<comment>You are playing the man and not the ball.  Why is that?  Don't you have any substantive argument for the ending of democracy, dissolution of the nation state, and the endless importation of foreign colonisers?</comment>

<comment>Hardly. The conflation of entirely separate issues makes a nonsense of your claims. After all Cameron is an idiot and totally corrupt but no one would want to say that provides the REASON why we should LEAVE. His inability to provide legally binding reforms however is a very good reason. MSM want to turn this into a personality contest but the truth is it is on issues not personalities.  It just goes to show how vacuous the REMAIN campaign has become already.</comment>

<comment>Europe and the EU are two different things. The champions of a bureaucratic unaccountable undemocratic EU are constantly peddling the lie that Europe is the EU. It is not. The Immigration Mess has been created by people who are not real pro-Europeans. They have violated every single rule in the book to impose their ideological stupidity that has generated a nightmare. A few months ago, Angela Merkel was making speeches and showing herself as a Do-Gooder opening the floodgates and telling everybody to come in. Now, the Do-Gooder has turned into the Evil Monster by threatening Greece and telling Greece that Greece should stop those wanting to come in or else.François Hollande is yet another Do-Gooder that is trying to put the burden of the nightmare he has promoted on somebody else's shoulders. It seems to be constant that the German Do-Gooder and the French Do-Gooder want to make somebody else pay for their stupid policies forcing Britain and others to take the people that they do not want. They even designed a plan to pay Turkey to keep Immigration at bay. Who wants to be a member of a club that has such idiots in command?</comment>

<comment>When you obtain 'free money', i.e. money that others have worked for but that you can spend as you wish, you tend to do very silly things with it. If you have a big ego, one option is to support causes that will improve your profile.So it is with the EU and the political elite and that is why they look like idiots to us, as you say.</comment>

<comment>France and Germany have long wanted and tried to supplant the City. Remaining outside the EZ of course calls into question Euro trading so you can expect Dave to move to join the Euro within a year of an in vote.You're unduly (deliberately) pessimistic about life outside the EU, as the 5th largest economy and major trading partner of many countries both in and out of that bloc those wanting access to our markets would not just talk but agree too. Part of Dave's cunning plan is to scare everyone, it's up to us if we want that or as Gove says, rediscover our Mojo. Incidentally, the city is more than currency it's also the world's leading law centre an export business threatened by the EU.</comment>

<comment>The existence of EU has had very little effect on European security, in fact its foray into Ukraine, the tragic shambles in Bosnia and its complete inability to prevent the migrants coming show the opposite if anything.There has been no major European conflict since 1945 because for a large part of that time the continent has hosted large standing armies of 'peace-keepers' from USSR and USA. Also, nuclear weapons, relative economic prosperity and the UN have had a calming effect.They really are clutching at straws now; they might as well claim that the absence of widespread famine or bubonic plague or even the invention of the iPhone is down to the EU.</comment>

<comment>They must have done something otherwise why do so many trolls here want to leave?</comment>

<comment>So convince this 'troll' to vote to remain - go on, it's a little challenge for you. Let me know why I should accept the unlimited problems of migration, ludicrous agriculture policy, the failing economies of Europe, the danger of a crazy currency being imposed on the UK, and the danger the EU puts us all in with its stupid foreign policy. I won't hold my breath.</comment>

<comment>You wish to suggest that anyone planning to vote leave is a "troll"?</comment>

<comment>He is complete plank;ignore the ignoramus.</comment>

<comment>It seems the only logical option...shame there isn't an "ignore" button on here, as with many other forums</comment>

<comment>Sky tried to convince me that the EU invented air travel ferries and ports last Monday evening.</comment>

<comment>I believe NATO is the reason that Europe has remained secure (outside of the  EU's expansionist exploits) and Britain would still remain a member of NATO if she left the EU, so why does Cameron say that we are safer in?</comment>

<comment>What would you expect him to say?</comment>

<comment>How about tell the truth for once?</comment>

<comment>He tells his truth...up to you if you swallow it</comment>

<comment>In the immortal words of Mandy Rice-Davies, "he would wouldn't he"</comment>

<comment>Point taken...</comment>

<comment>So was David Owen wrong then or is he wrong now? Lots of people, including me, have concerns about the EU as it currently operates. It needs to be reformed. David Cameron has made a start. Now the hard work begins, with Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Poland and Ireland by our side. But to walk out at this moment because of an immigration crisis (and let us not pretend that most Outers don't regard this as reasons number 1, 2 and 3) is naive and stupid. Neither the EU nor the immigrants are going away. The idea that the UK can be restored to its default status by voting Out is little more than wishful thinking. And to believe that we won't continue to face a worsening immigration crisis after Brexit is just plain crazy.</comment>

<comment>1. Cameron has done nothing to reform the EU - just obtained an 'EU promise' - a bit like a lady of the night promising to love you in the morning (but pay me now).2. The issue of immigration is huge - as a MS of the EU the UK will end up being forced to take and support large number of economic 'hand up your skirt' migrants. Out of the EU, we won't - simple.3. Out of the EU we can have our own agriculture, fishery, foreign, trade and economic policies. In the EU we are forced to adopt what suites the other 27 members.To imagine the EU will not force their view on the UK (we have a 100% record of being voted down) is your own version of wishful thinking.</comment>

<comment>Walter, you obviously do not yet realise that leaving the EU is only a small, first step in the long journey of undoing the great metapolitical shifts of the second half of the 20th century, and the political and demographic shifts they initiated.  The peoples of Europe are pushing back, seeking to restore control over their destiny and to secure their actual existence.  They must succeed.  There is no higher cause.Look at this struggle in the broadest possible historical sense, and I believe you will find it difficult to maintain support for the present power dispensation.</comment>

<comment>We must agree to disagree, Maj.</comment>

<comment>Pendulums swing, Walter.  Be sure to catch this swing early enough.</comment>

<comment>At least we live in interesting times, God help us.</comment>

<comment>Yes, that is something I often think about.  I am in my mid-sixties.  As a young man I regularly cursed my luck that my grandfather and my father had, in their time, great and terrible struggles to throw themselves into, and prove themselves thereby - or die trying.  Peace is a great good, for sure.  But there seemed to be something very stultifying to the human spirit in the petty suburban experience of it.  I did not know that the most dangerous, mortal enemy European peoples could possibly face - a deadly treachery from within its own elites - was already in control of our destiny, and its actions over the rest of my life would bring a more final destruction than any European war.  But I know now.</comment>

<comment>I, too, am getting on. I'm 67 and living in retirement in France. And, like you, I have had it relatively easy down the years – never called up, never obliged to face the enemy. On the whole, I'm grateful for this. I'm certainly grateful to be alive and living (mainly) off my pensions. Years ago, as part of my career as a foreign correspondent, I worked for the Irish Times, then the FT, covering the EU. It was both boring and exhilarating. The bureaucracy was stifling, the company entertaining. I want to see more democracy and less petty interference, but I will be horrified if Britain walks out instead of remaining in and fighting for change. I'm sure you feel the same, but the other way round.</comment>

<comment>As Leo Strauss put it, "The future will be a world of entertainment without the possibility of political struggle."  Not a world I want my children to live in.</comment>

<comment>David Cameron has not made a start. If you think that any other country also wants reform I would like to know why they didn't all agree and instead of fobbing Cameron off, they could have got together and discussed reform. Reform is not going to happen. The others want closer union and as we don't we will never be at the heart, always on the side-lines getting the worst of everything.</comment>

<comment>I don't agree, Mr B. The countries I listed have alll said they want reform. The Czech Prime Minister even said this week that if Britain leaves and there is no reform, then his country will also consider leaving. The East Bloc, led by Poland and Hungary, are unhappy about Schengen and want no part of the incoming immigrant tide. Even France, while proclaiming its wish for ever closer union, is under increasing pressure from within the resist such a move. Not everyone wants the same set of reforms that Britain wants. That would be odd, would it not? – a 28-member Union run by the wishes of a single state. What I am saying is that we will face many of the same problems if we leave the EU as we do now. We will also have to confront a resentful phalanx of governments who will blame us for turning the Union upside down and distracting it from the vital work at hand of dealing with the immigrant crisis. Europe will not make it easy for us post-Brexit. We will be punished for the damage we do. Nor will the immigrants themselves go away. Even UKIP has acknowledged that nearly all of the two million existing EU migrants will be allowed to remain after Britain leaves, includiing those who will arrive this year. As for the Syrians and others (many of them from North Africa), the new President of the northern French region said this week that he would reimpose French controls over the port of Calais if the British walk out of the EU. As I write, the bulldozers are poised to demolish the Calais Jungle with a view to dispersing its inhabitants to other Channel Ports where the Brits have no authority. The mayor of Ouistreham has already expressed his dismay. Be careful what you wish for. You might just get it.</comment>

<comment>What a load of rubbish. Project Fear writ large. Do you really think you are talking to impressionable 15 year olds?</comment>

<comment>I don't think that the eastern members want ever closer union. They just want free money.</comment>

<comment>Immigration and whether we pay benefits or not is an emotional smokescreen, being merely symptoms of the real problem.</comment>

<comment>Possibly...I suspect it will influence quite a lot of people though</comment>

<comment>If the Scot's want Cameron out they need to vote for LEAVEIf Nippy wants a second referendum on independence, she needs to back the LEAVE campaign.I know the Jock Vote is smaller than the London Vote in a UK Wide Plebescite, but every little helps.</comment>

<comment>The economic argument might need a bit of a tweak with the oil price.</comment>

<comment>Interesting articlle over at The Guardian today.  Some 60% of Scots want us to either leave the EU, or for the EU to repatiate powers.  Support for Scottish independence is down to 22%.  And the Scots are only 5% less Eurosceptic than the figure for the British population.  Interesting times!</comment>

<comment>You do know the reason they sent the Scottish regiments in to battle at the front was because they would stab you in the back if they brought up rear dont you?</comment>

<comment>Any person who thinks that EU can guarantee Europe's security is deluded.And, implicit implication suggesting EU standing alone can deter Russian-Putinist, aggressive adventurism, is, also, far more delusional. Yugoslavia and Ukraine, as Fraser Nelson has pointed out, demonstrates the weaknessof the European Union in guaranteeing security for non-Russians in Easternor Western European, if and when threatened.In fact, Crimea, now annexed by Russia, exemplifies the EU's inability toto apply common defense of Europe against external threats, like thosefrom Russia, which is the biggest threat to contemporary stability in theworld right now. But, that has not deterred the EU from acting or makingdecisions like it has its own defense or military forces, where as it hasnone, except those of member-nations operating with their own militaryforces in matters or exigencies of national security.But, one thing is clear: EU is counting on Article 5 of the NATO's charter thatcovers the mutual-defense clause. Because, most of EU members are NATOmember-countries, paying and contributing to the NATO defense expenditure,including recent 2 percent across-the-board defense increase. The UnitedStates is not an EU member-nation. But, it strongly and openly supportscontinuous UK's EU membership, even through, the U.S, may not liketo be so nakedly ambitious in pro-EU activism in the referendum politics.But, America supports and guarantees EU security through NATO. Rightnow, the only direct tools the EU has as punishment or deterrent are sanctionsand isolation, which are, also, more effective when supported by Americansanctions. The reason they are so effective, is because they are outsidethe realms of veto powers of Russia and China exercised through theSecurity Council at the United Nations. EU-US sanctions crippled thethe Assad Syria regime, until ISIS rose, came in and destabilized and discombobulated the whole arrangement.As the BBC reported early Thursday morning, the EU sanctions backedby the U.S. variety) have  almost crippled the Russian economy exacerbated by the deflated oil prices that earn by far lower income by oil-producing nations. If anything, trend or development would de-escalate Russia'smilitaristic adventurism, that will be EU, U.S.backed sanctions. RussiaPrime Minister Dimtry Medvedev recently hinted that EU sanctions (that have devastated the  Russian economy) have to be lifted for broader peace arrangements. But,  western allies are not giving in to the proposal.EU was initially established as an economic union under which peacefulco-existence among European nations can be promoted. That still remainsthe case. European defense is not part of the mandate. I once saw a budgetof EU security standing at $32 million. That can't even buy a low-level warplane. But, EU knows that its defense and future are inextricably linked withor to NATO.  Yet, there are serious talks for an EU Army. But, it's not veryserious when it comes to implementation. Nonetheless, the EU knows NATO got is back.Igonikon Jack, USA</comment>

<comment>As I and other readers have been pointing out all along:'Correct punctuation, grammar, spelling, sentence structure, style, and word choice are important to the reader because they drastically affect perceptions of the writers (sic)  authority and credibility.'It interesting to note that the writers  of this piece entitled 'General Strategies for Editing and Proofreading', have themselves made a grammatical error in this sentence, however, it in no way invalidates their directive.https://gustavus.edu/writingce... </comment>

<comment>To: Mark BarberThank you for your intelligent comment. I wrote mycomment for informed Daily Telegraph readers likeyou. I don't have time for diatribes and (com)postsdumped like those above you. The poster above andbelow you is reeling from defeatism, because I rebuffed and ignored him like other adult delinquents who wasted time posting trash against me, and, also, trying to justify their irrelevance. He doesn't have ideas to share. Hejust follows me around dumping his (com)posts.Many trolls failed in the attempt. He's already ignoredand marginalized like his fellow rejected trolls.Overwhelming majority--millions of posters--have rejected their trolling and failed efforts to grow a trolling workshop against me. Many old timers knowwhat happened here. Such trolls were all defeated.I dealt with them some time ago. Many of them fledto go and start posting comments like the rest, insteadof seeking cheap attention that gets them nowhere,through me and my post space. To that end, the Comment site benefited. That was my whole aim.Now, I'm focused on other aspirations. But, I'll alwayscome to DT and the Comment site I worked hard,along with other contributors, to advance--postcommentaries, along with those at Telegraph View,though they still come late, because of other contributions beyond DT, along with my work. It's anew era. I don't have to waste time on (com)posts. I'm glad to read your comment. See you again online.Igonikon Jack, USA</comment>

<comment>'Thank you for your intelligent comment.'You really are a child, aren't you Jack, without one iota of rational adult intelligence. We have been following your commentary daily for some time and seriously find it very sad that you seem entirely  unable to help yourself or seek the help you need, and which obviously  cannot be found here in the commentary.</comment>

<comment>Jack, note I have just reported one of the 'intelligent' comments from Mark Barber which was immediately removed. I suggest you try following the threads to see who you are responding to, as well as  criticising, as unlike my feedback yours is entirely baseless!</comment>

<comment>Well Jack, at least "the poster above and below you" knows the difference between the Duke of Cambridge and the Duke of Edinburgh.If it really is "a new era", as you keep telling us, perhaps you will take the trouble to find out.</comment>

<comment>The  whole history of the EU is one in which the UK has taken second place to Franco/German ambitions for a European continent they see as theirs for the taking.The UK has dithered on the edges for too long, and even now Cameron wants no part of a politically strengthening EU, so why go on with it? It is time to go.</comment>

<comment>I see non-foods is back trolling again</comment>

<comment>he sticks to what he is good at</comment>

<comment>Yes the anti-independence fighters and trolls are out in force today. They know they are losing the argument and are resorting to Herr Goebbel's tactic of lies, misinformation and trivialising opponents. The best way to deal with the trivial is ignore it. I think we all need to ignore them.</comment>

<comment>Yes, did you know that a government elected by FPTP is less democratic than government by an unelected Commission?  Amazing how europhilia scrambles the brain.</comment>

<comment>EUphilia if you please...nothing wrong with the continent of Europe</comment>
