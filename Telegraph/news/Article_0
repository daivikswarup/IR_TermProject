The eurozone crisis has added extra pressure for political integration amongst euro area members in particular. </p><p> Even today there is an explicit goal, by 2025, of “completing Europe’s economic and monetary union”, including creating a euro area treasury, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/12060012/David-Camerons-new-EU-relationship-is-not-what-were-being-told.html" target="_blank">set out in the “Five President’s Report”</a> — the five presidents concerned being the presidents of the European Commission, European Council, Eurogroup, European Central Bank, and European Parliament. The current president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, claimed to have been elected to the role, and although that claim was hotly disputed there is ongoing pressure to have an elected European president. </p><p> <span class="ssImg "><img alt="President of the Eurogroup, Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker during a news conference at the end of an European Euro group Finance Ministers meeting at the European council headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, 16 November 2010" height="387" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03118/juncker_3118008b.jpg" version="b" width="620"/><span class="artImageExtras" style="max-width:620px;"><span class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption">The weary emperor: Jean-Claude Juncker</span><span class="credit">  Photo: EPA</span></span></span></span></p><p> The central case scenario for the EU, if the UK remains, must that it will continue along the path of deeper political integration that it has pursued for the past 60 years and that it states it will continue to pursue. Given the pressures of the eurozone and migration crises, the most natural directions for such future integration would be towards mechanisms for closer fiscal cooperation within the eurozone and for more robust policing of the external (EU to non-EU) border of the Schengen Area. </p><p> That could thus mean a eurozone Treasury, with eurozone tax-raising, debt-raising and spending powers, which would in turn necessitate some mechanisms for democratic oversight of tax-raising and spending, such as an elected eurozone or European president. It could also mean Schengen Area border guards and perhaps also <a href="http://www.alde.eu/event-seminar/events-details/article/does-schengen-require-a-european-fbi-37837/" target="_blank">a Schengen “FBI”-style police force</a> funded and controlled via some coordinated central agency (presumably an executive agency of the European Commission). </p><p>

The main UK interests in things the EU does or might do or should do differently might become a very low priority for states who are focused upon managing their relationships with the European presidency, the eurozone treasury, or EU agencies overseeing border guards and a Schengen “FBI”. </p><p> That could therefore mean that the rules even of the aspect of the EU that the UK wants to remain involved in, such as the single market, start to be set more and more by the EU member states that are more involved in the EU’s main projects, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11864694/A-semi-detached-Britain-may-still-be-too-close-to-the-EU-super-state.html" target="_blank">while the UK is overruled by them</a>. </p><p> A key upside of this scenario for the UK is that deeper political integration might potentially make the euro function stably and sustainably, releasing the euro area economy to a period of rapid catch-up growth in which it recovers much of the lost ground of the past decade.

Everyone else would always have bigger or more urgent fish to fry. </p><p> Second, the muddle on through scenario would be likely to leave continental economies sclerotic, dysfunctional and unstable, meaning that our major trading partners would be risky investments and offer limited growth opportunities for UK businesses, relative to the rest of the world. </p><p> <span class="ssImg "><img alt=" Spanish riot police clash with protesters in Valencia, eastern Spain" height="387" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02398/valencia-police_2398620b.jpg" version="b" width="620"/><span class="artImageExtras" style="max-width:620px;"><span class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption"> Spanish riot police clash with protesters in Valencia, eastern Spain</span><span class="credit">  Photo: EPA/MANUEL BRUQUE</span></span></span></span></p><p style="margin-top: -20px;"></p><h3 class="was-h4"> Likelihood of this scenario </h3><p></p><p> This scenario should not be considered altogether implausible.

Perhaps other countries might follow the UK’s lead in having their own In-Out referendum and for many of them the choice be Out. Perhaps some country such as Greece or Italy might be driven out of the euro by financial or budgetary problems, with this triggering a financial crisis that induces a more widespread collapse. Perhaps the attempt to push deeper political integration might fail, with some required new Treaty being rejected, at ratification stage, by many member states, leading to a widespread crisis. </p><p> Or perhaps wealthier states such as Finland or Germany might simply decide that the euro crisis and migration crisis are just another mechanism by which the EU makes them bear the costs of others’ failure, and withdraw. </p><p>

That might mean the European Union lost its ability to push for privatisation, restrictions on state aid, openness to foreign takeovers (e.g. by UK investors), competition and deregulation — all of which have been amongst the most important gains to the UK of EU membership. </p><p> A positive risk to the UK under this scenario is that in a looser partnership, the UK might be seen both to be vindicated (by having stayed out of what would then be regarded as a failed attempt at political integration) and influential in its own right (as a leader in best practice in the kinds of single market-oriented economic and regulatory issues that would then be the core and almost-only focus of the European project). The UK could thus potentially be the leading geopolitical voice in Europe, with potential spillover gains for leading a European response to geopolitically significant events (e.g. Russia, Syria). </p><p style="margin-top: -20px;"></p><h3 class="was-h4"> Likelihood of this scenario </h3><p></p><p> The EU is often described as being like a bicycle — if you stop pedalling you’ll fall off.

Even recent threats by its third-largest member (the UK) to leave did not persuade EU heads of government to agree the return of a single veto to the UK or the removal of any aspect of the “acquis” (the set of matters over which the EU has decision- and law-making competence). </p><p> For EU members suddenly to favour a looser partnership would be revolutionary, and must be considered so unlikely as to be statistically implausible. Less than 5 per cent chance. </p><p> <iframe frameborder="0" height="458" id="tweetframe" scrolling="no" src="http://renderer.qmerce.com/interaction/56d03bda5762585b454759f0" width="100%"></iframe> </p></div>
