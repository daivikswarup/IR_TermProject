Go to their website; they cannot even seem to make up their mind about the name of their firm. Logo says "Ring bell". Write-up says "Ringing bells". Founders have no links to the mobility business. Other than one picture of one phone and images rendered on their site, has anyone even seen a real phone. Well, it is a simple scam helped by free publicity thanks to media (but Nitin Pai here does a good job of raising the right questions). Stop falling prey to scamsters guys...wake up Bharat/India

                            @pk: 1. Though company is named Ringing Bells they are trying to use the name BELL phone which soon might attract a legal notice from Bell Labs and how stupid and naive they are to do so!!!<br/>
2. The company seemed to be run by husband and wife who can't even write properly.<br/>
3. Looks like the guy got married and got plenty dowry and show casing all sorts of jewellery and make me wonder what sort of new breed of folks these are. Looks like a total scam by some small town folks whose initial target was locals but somehow it got highlighted in the media nation wide.<br/>
4. Most importantly some folks are already made some transactions and trying to contact the owner and he seems not available. <br/><br/>
So dear PK, if we don't question this scam we would be the losers that let the poor people get robbed or Govt get robbed. So let us do our job and you try to think better for this country.  This comment has absolutely no value in my opinion and is against national interest.

                            I disagree with the author. I think that the smart phone which is sold at the price of 50 thousand rupees is over priced over 50 times. Otherwise the raw material usually involved in manufacturing a phone in large scale in my view should not be more than 50 rupees. Thus there is no need to subsidise the phone. Things are overpriced and we are conditioned to believe that it is normal, thus anyone who sells something at the right price, we tend to think that it must be subsidised.

2.  -  secondly you share your credit or debit card number with this kind of unknown company.<br/>
3.  -  and third and most important thing is that if ....(by chance) you get this product and starts to us as your "SMARTPHONE" you should be ready for the blast any time because it's not a smartphone but a smart bomb,,,,, yes a smart bomb ,,,, just imagine what kind of plastic, battery, circuits and other materials they will use in it ?????????  i think it will blast on a very first day you start using it... so don't look at its price only but think about your safety guys.... <br/>
