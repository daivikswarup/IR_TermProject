Hillary Clinton's Intersectional Politics


Hillary Clinton has taken pains to describe the lead-contaminated drinking water of Flint, Michigan, not only as a public-health and environmental crisis, but also as a crisis of poverty and racism. Along the way, the Democratic presidential contender has invoked the idea of intersectionality, the concept that different forms of inequality and discrimination overlap and compound one another.Clinton’s use of the term, which was at one time largely confined to academia, signals that it is now a common way of thinking about inequality for a younger generation. Her decision to employ it may also elevate the concept in American politics, and alter the terms of a national debate over poverty, racism and other forms of inequity.In recent weeks, Clinton has increasingly made reference to the concept on the campaign trail. “We face a complex set of economic, social, and political challenges. They are intersectional, they are reinforcing, and we have got to take them all on,” Clinton declared during a February speech in Harlem. Over the weekend, her campaign tweeted that “Flint's water crisis is an example of the combined effects of intersecting issues that impact communities of color.” An appended graphic draws literal lines between “poverty,” “systemic racism,” “underfunded school systems,” and “crumbling infrastructure.”How Perceptions About Opportunity Vary by RaceIntersectionality was coined in the late 1980s to explain how different markers of identity coalesce to yield unique forms of discrimination. A black woman, for example, might experience not only racism and sexism in her daily life, but could also confront additional barriers that white women and black men do not. It became a way of making visible the experience of individuals that had previously been caught between the feminist and civil-rights movements.Today, the term has been embraced by many of the younger voters flocking to Bernie Sanders, whom Clinton has so far struggled to win over. Deploying the concept could help Clinton appeal to a younger generation. An intersectional agenda also lends itself to a set of talking points that dovetails with the central argument Clinton has been making all along: That she is better qualified than Sanders, with his focus on tackling economic inequality, to confront the wide array of challenges facing our country. The campaign subtly leveled that critique when it tweeted: “It's not enough to talk only about economics. We have to tackle racial, economic, & environmental justice—together.”Still, Clinton isn’t the only Democratic presidential candidate advocating the approach. Sanders has also invoked intersectionality, even if he may not be talking about the concept quite as explicitly. Sanders has outlined the argument that minorities are uniquely vulnerable to multiple forms of violence, including physical, economic, and environmental violence. His recognition that communities of color are not only subject to overt and physical acts of racism, but also disproportionately suffer from economic deprivation and environmental pollution, likewise stands as an implicit acknowledgement of intersectionality.Clinton has been winning over black voters by a wide margin, but faces lingering distrust over tough-on-crime policies signed into law by former President Bill Clinton, a legacy that she has worked to distance herself from. Talking up intersectionality on the campaign trail could help, though it’s hard to say how far that will take her. Clinton narrowly edged out Sanders in Genesee County, home to the city of Flint, but lost the Michigan primary on Tuesday despite her effort to shine a spotlight on the water crisis. She is also sure to face charges of opportunism as she advocates intersectionality, and has already been accused of politicizing the Flint water crisis.At a certain point, though, it doesn’t matter whether Clinton’s motives in talking about intersectionality are cynical or pure. Her public advocacy of an intersectional approach to politics brings the concept further into the political mainstream. It could introduce the term to new audiences, and shape the way politicians, particularly on the political Left, think and talk about, as well as offer solutions to, inequality and discrimination.“A lot of times we approach politics from the standpoint that every issue we encounter should be thought of and dealt with separately,” said Leslie McCall, a professor of sociology and political science at Northwestern University. “If we have someone who starts to use the term ‘intersectional’ and who is willing to draw connections between things previously thought of as independent from one another, I think that is a more accurate representation of how the world actually works and would be progress.”Clinton’s invocation of intersectionality may also broaden popular understanding of the concept. In popular culture, it has been variously deployed. Intersectionality has been denounced by conservatives as a form of identity politics. Progressives, meanwhile, have used the term both to conceptualize identity and as a framework to broadly explain how different structural barriers operate simultaneously. Clinton is using the concept to denote an integrated approach to dealing with deeply-intertwined environmental, economic, and social problems.“It’s tremendously important for new frames to enter our political lexicon to deal with old problems. They mark a space and set of realities that might otherwise slip through the cracks,” said Kimberlé Crenshaw, a law professor at Columbia University and the University of California-Los Angeles who originally coined the term. “It’s refreshing that people are starting to talk about intersectionality in ways that are far more inclusive of the variety of challenges we face as a society, and understanding that this isn’t just about an identity politics.”Of course, acknowledging the complexity of problems isn’t the same as offering concrete solutions. As Clinton helps popularize the term, there’s risk of it becoming a meaningless buzzword, or being dismissed as an exclusively liberal concern. When Clinton, Sanders, and their supporters talk about intersectionality, they’re simultaneously offering a framework for tying together disparate concerns, and shifting the boundaries of public debate. As progressives contest the specific meaning and implications of the way the candidates deploy the idea, those boundaries will surely continue to shift.

But not the voters, who desperately wondered from candidate to candidate , to find a "not-Romney". And so, no matter how much he "rebranded" , "refocused", and "remessaged" was actively disliked by a large portion of his own base. And now we see it again. Hillary shedding political positions like worn pantsuits, without missing a heartbeat. The truth is, there's no magic bullet. Going all hipster and pressing the magical buzzword doesn't work anymore.

I think you probably know that, too.</comment>

John832::Thursday, March 10, 2016 9:38 AM::<comment>When I was studying economics I don't recall the basic laws of supply and demand behaving differently for poor export based economies.  In fact I think you'll find those economies are especially sensitive to labor costs because there isn't any reason why you can't move it to the other side of the island and produce it in the Dominican Republic (and indeed while none of my clothing is made in Haiti, some of it is made in the DR).</comment>

veganforever::Thursday, March 10, 2016 3:04 AM::<comment>It is my deepest hope that the concept of intersectionality will come to include the animals in our midst--those we exploit for food, entertainment, clothing, science, farming, and other uses. I firmly believe that once we come to grips with and acknowledge, as a nation, how ALL our problems--environmental, economic, and social--are connected, and so negatively linked to animal agriculture and animal exploitation, we will move swiftly toward justice for ALL. A wise man once said, "The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated." That man was Gandhi. It is my fervent hope that Hillary Clinton will make the connection, as President of the United States,  between how poorly we treat animals and how poorly we treat one another. She's got the concept--now may she use it to its fullest potential. For ALL animal someones--human and nonhuman.</comment>

James::Thursday, March 10, 2016 3:07 AM::<comment>One of the reasons I support Bernie Sanders is his record supporting animal rights. He's certainly not Kucinich-level, but he's far ahead of any other candidates. I wouldn't trust Clinton to sign any bills that would might conceivably hurt the profits of agricultural-industry giants.</comment>

veganforever::Thursday, March 10, 2016 3:10 AM::<comment>Actually, Bernie and Hillary alike support animals "welfare" NOT animal rights. Supporting animal "welfare" [slightly larger cages and following minimal standards of intensive confinement and standard operating practices (which, of course, include tail docking, castration without anesthesia, beak "trimming," ear notching, horn removal, branding, male chick grinding, forced insemination, removal of infant calves from their mothers, physical separation of mother pigs from their own sweet piglets, and on and on ad nauseum)] and supporting animal rights (not eating animals or their secretions or supporting animal farmers or any animal exploitation at all) are two whole different balls of yarn (like the difference between synthetic and wool). Bernie supports animal farming and likes to eat animals, he openly admits as much, so his "welfare" stance is duplicitous at best. No one is holding Bernie to a higher standard. Animal-rights activists love to trot out Bernie's 100% approval rating on animal "welfare" as an argument in Bernie's favor, but what they fail to consider is that "welfare" doesn't mean squat to the animals. Look, none of the presidential candidates has adequate records on animal rights, but Hillary and Bernie are about equal when it comes to "welfare" for farmed animals, sad as that is. Animal "welfare," as we all know, is bogus anyway.</comment>

James::Thursday, March 10, 2016 3:19 AM::<comment>I'm aware of the distinctions between rights and welfare. I'd love to have a serious presidential candidate who is also vegan, but I think that's going to be a long wait.In the meantime, I disagree that Clinton and Bernie are about equal when it comes to the well-being of animals, and Bernie's broader platform and ideals would allow for much greater growth than Clinton's consistently neoliberal, pro-business approach. That's part of why I'm voting for Bernie.</comment>

James::Thursday, March 10, 2016 6:07 AM::<comment>a) because plants don't have a nervous system with which to experience pain, and b) even if you believed they did, feeding plants to animals and then eating animals would result in a lot more harm to plants than just eating plants. Also c) you might think you're being clever, funny, or insightful, but that question is none of those things.</comment>

Trump spreads his message though fostering fear of the other, Sanders fosters class warefare.HRC takes the measured path (an extension of Obama), of moderation, openness, fostering trade and development based on innovation and fair competition; a national and internationalist perspective based on pragmatism, not rigid ideology. In that respect, intersectionality is apt.</comment>

That is in no way pragmatic, even to the simplest of minds (except maybe yours). You're the only one here practicing a rigid ideology. And "openness"? Please! HRC is a back room dealmaking shill. Why not show the speeches if she's so "open"?</comment>

James::Thursday, March 10, 2016 3:12 AM::<comment>Intersectionality, as it's defined and used in academic circles, is diametrically opposed to the sort of US-interests-first approach that Clinton has taken during her career. You can't be a sincere proponent of intersectional approaches while pushing unilateral regime change in one country and undermining democracy in others, all while completely ignoring the racial, economic, et cetera implications of your choices.</comment>

Josh::Thursday, March 10, 2016 3:18 AM::<comment>While I'm totally Feeling the Bern myself, by the rubric you suggest Sanders has some of the same problems. If he pursues certain types of trade protectionism we can expect there to be a negative effect on the world's poor.</comment>

James::Thursday, March 10, 2016 3:26 AM::<comment>I agree that Bernie seems likely to err on the side of protecting American jobs over "lifting all boats," as they say, but part of his criticism of free trade agreements is that they create a race to the bottom for workers everywhere.I am not opposed to imports and international trade when it helps impoverished nations help themselves, but agreements like TPP and NAFTA simply allow corporations to shift production to wherever work is cheapest and wherever worker protections the least detrimental to the bottom line.My impression has been that Bernie's position is similar. There's no real harm to US manufacturing if we're competing with other companies on a level field.</comment>

Damascusdean::Thursday, March 10, 2016 4:34 AM::<comment>Its more complicated than that. Much American manufacturing relies on inexpensive parts produced elsewhere. Trade is incredibly complex. We can think we are protecting jobs but end up losing far more than we protect, and raising prices on all sorts of things.</comment>

Bodhi LeRoc::Thursday, March 10, 2016 8:30 AM::<comment>This is why translating Sanders' ideology as well as his platform in the context of intersectionality can be limiting; rather than try to fit him into an "armchair political analysts" point of view, why not instead just view it from Sander's own construct - democracatic socialism. Democratic socialism automatically views everything being connected, which includes domestic policies in the context of international policies and vice versa. It's a different perspective than a "us" vs "them," more one of just automatically seeing the connections, and being respectful of them as you identify problems, and explore solutions. This is something that Sanders is both brilliant at, and naturally inclined toward.</comment>

John832::Thursday, March 10, 2016 6:28 AM::<comment>You don't have unlimited resources.  The Flint government failed to adequately address the problem either by shifting spending, raising more revenue, or seeking outside assistance.  It compounded the problem by not properly treating the water (failed to consider the effects of the new water source on the pipes).  The EPA failed as well because the Safe Drinking Water Act requires that it receive test results which showed high lead levels.  We found out about this from a reporter, not from the local water utility and not from the EPA.</comment>

We are enlightened.This truths have been painfully obvious to me 18 years ago, days upon landing at O'Hare airport in Chicago. Bernie has been talking about them for 50 years.Now all of a sudden it is an all important lofty concept of "intersectionalism". And when the election cycle is over, we'll just stop talking about it. Give me a break!</comment>

Daniel::Thursday, March 10, 2016 3:17 AM::<comment>Once again Hillary is parroting Sanders. She wants to keep the ability to call Sanders a one issue candidate, while at the same time repeating his message that income inequality is a major driver of the social injustices plaguing our country today. To anyone with an analytical mindset, it becomes clear that is is just another calculated political move designed to boost her numbers with the millennials. Not at all conceived of by her, of course. This is a calculation made by her army of campaign psychologists and marketing experts that are paid for by her Wall Street super packs. Hollow as a clam shell. I especially like how the author says that the term intersectionality is a word used in academia, "Clinton’s use of the term, which was at one time largely confined to academia, signals that it is now a common way of thinking about inequality for a younger generation."I'm proud of the millennials. They represent the most informed and educated generation to ever grace the face of the earth. Despite being called naive, idealistic (as if that's somehow a bad thing to be nowadays), foolish, entitled, and lazy by their own party (which is an establishment pawn and really doesn't represent them, hence Sanders) the right, and the baby boomers, they continue to show their intelligence through deep understanding of the fundamental constructs holding our great nation in peril. I'm sorry baby boomers but you need to turn off your television and start seeking the truth elsewhere. You are being lied to. I know you were all brainwashed into fearing more social forms of government during the red scare and the age of Mccarthyism, but it's time to drop the rhetoric and actually look into what Sanders represents. If you can't see through Hillary by now you're either not paying attention or are a low information voter who has not taken the time to properly vet the candidates using a critical methodology. We have a chance to elect a true patriot who loves the people of this nation and sees the potential of the millennial generation who have the power and knowledge to fundamentally change the structure of our nation both physically, through science and technology, and socially. If we can retool to clean energy and provide healthcare for all, creating millions of jobs in the process, you will see intersectionality begin to correlate with positive changes brought about by Sanders' political revolution.</comment>

Damascusdean::Thursday, March 10, 2016 4:44 AM::<comment>I'll put it this way. Every academic and professional field requires a lot of intellect to make any contribution to. The sort of brainpower that is good at physics is different than the sort of brainpower that does economics or sociology, but it is a matter of kind, not a matter of degree.There are brilliant mathematicians who cannot boil an egg or make toast. That doesn't mean their cook is smarter than they are. Just differently smart.So back to the subject here. Some people spend their lives studying the intersection of sociology, economics, psychology, etc, and they come up with theories as to why we get differential  outcomes that go beyond "hard work" or "smart investor." If we actually want to make social progress, we might want to consider listening to what they have to say instead of insisting on a simple solution to what are complicated matters.Or we can just make fun of big words and scratch our armpits.</comment>

Tim_Sims::Thursday, March 10, 2016 4:32 AM::<comment>"Progressive" actually makes a lot more sense to describe modern leftists than "liberal," since in a very broad sense, leftists see change as progress (as opposed to conservatives, who, broadly, see it as decay and loss), and they are more interested in notions of equality than notions of liberty.  Liberty is the basis of actual "liberal" thought.Not that these terms are alone in being distorted in American politics.  There's nothing actually "conservative" about wanting to fight wars constantly, and once upon a time in America the desire to jump into every conflict was seen as a trait more in tune with busybody progressives than with real conservatives.American "conservatism" really has more in common with nationalism than a desire to be cautious.</comment>

Tim_Sims::Thursday, March 10, 2016 4:52 AM::<comment>Nope."Progressive," like many words, has many meanings.Here is the "simple" definition according to Merriam-Webster:": moving forward: happening or developing gradually over a period of time: using or interested in new or modern ideas especially in politics and education"So while there may have been a political movement that called itself "THE" progressive movement, the fact is that the word has a much broader meaning that applies exactly as I said.I appreciate your effort to lend specific context to the conversation, but no I am not in need of correction.  What I said was, and is, a correct and common usage of the word.</comment>

Yawn.If the Millennials really find the concept appealing then I give them credit for not sleeping in classrooms when they actually should be sleeping.I am glad Hillary has "discovered" the term.  Not a substitute for passion, belief, and authenticity.  Rather it is precisely the opposite.  Abstraction over reality.  Theory over practice.Moreover in a contest with Trump, do we honestly believe that the adoption of the concept of "intersectionality" by the Dems is a game changer?  Sounds like a "loser" idea to me.</comment>

In the end, he has been most successful with the standard liberal social points, which is disappointing, as he presented as something new.  I am sure that he has been worn down by the vitriol directed towards him.  In some ways he is a bit Carter-esque.  Good person + tried hard + touch naïve = weak president.  In my opinion, best thing that Obama has done has been normalizing relations with Cuba.  Trying to solve health care crisis was admirable, but doing as a single party measure made it divisive.  Taking out Bin-Laden was good too.  We could do a lot worse than Obama - he didn't do anywhere near the amount of affirmative harm that W did, but 20 years from now these 8 years won't be too memorable (and that isn't the worst thing).  Grade B to B-.</comment>

It's short-circuiting your thought processes.By the way, I'm Norwegian.  That's about as white as you get, sonny, and it took me a while to realize my privilege, too.</comment>

Poe's Law::Thursday, March 10, 2016 9:26 AM::<comment>No. Essential whiteness is English. Norwegians had to earn it. </comment>

RetroPam::Thursday, March 10, 2016 9:59 AM::<comment>That works.</comment>

Poe's Law::Thursday, March 10, 2016 9:23 AM::<comment>Except those who recognise that "white" is a term of manipulation.As my mother said,  "Some people just need someone to look down on so they feel better about themselves. "Whiteness in a nutshell. </comment>

Poe's Law::Thursday, March 10, 2016 9:53 AM::<comment>Yep, when you don't know what to say, you just pull out the race card.Sad </comment>

Poe's Law::Thursday, March 10, 2016 9:20 AM::<comment>Now I get it. When you disagree with something but don't have anything cogent to say, you just say, "racist. "Simples.</comment>

Betty::Thursday, March 10, 2016 7:14 AM::<comment>Are you sure that it isn't just a way for academics to generate additional critical theory papers?</comment>

KoreanKat::Thursday, March 10, 2016 10:26 AM::<comment>As a feminist I have literally never seen intersectionality broadly accepted in any quarter as meaning, and I am in agreement with you on a theoretical level, what you state it should mean.The practical reality going back even before Crenshaw coined the phrase was about subordinating women's rights to Critical Race Theory. Racism is the king and everyone else needs to bow on one knee.The toxic effect is nowhere more obvious than the upside-down reality where misogynistic norms in Islam are aggressively defended by many feminists and feminists who do criticize Islamic norms are 'racists.'  Even more damingly, we basically do nothing as a society to prevent FGM in African diaspora groups beyond pro forma illegality.   </comment>

RetroPam::Thursday, March 10, 2016 10:35 AM::<comment>You are so right.  Something happened along the way from our ringing the alarm bells about the Taliban and similar oppression during the 1990s, and today.My charitable explanation is that a lot of us instinctively defend the (real or perceived) targets of unfair prejudice - in this case, defending American Muslims against blanket bigotry that they exeperience in the United States.  Unfortunately, sometimes that motive can drown out the progressive voices that call out evils like FGM. As for the meaning of intersectionality, my explanation of it is how I always interpreted the term.  I confess that I'm unaware of any carry-over meaning that predated it.Yesterday was International Women's Day.  I hope you enjoyed the sound track that the American mainstream media (are you in the United States?) chose to commemorate it: crickets.</comment>

CgntvDssdnt::Thursday, March 10, 2016 6:30 AM::<comment>Good for her. This will help her appeal to the younger crowd, and she needs to improve her popularity there.</comment>
