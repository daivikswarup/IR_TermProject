Headline::::Why Modi Is Still Silent On Dadri



DateTime::::2015-10-09T19:42:00+05:30




                                Every newspaper in India carried the same headline on Friday, the 9th of October: 'Modi breaks silence on Dadri lynching.' It says something about the breathless desperation of the Indian press to hear the prime minister say something, anything, that could be interpreted as his disapproval of political barbarism, that there wasn't, in fact, a word in his speech about the Dadri lynching.
Modi began by quoting and congratulating himself. Two years ago he had addressed a public meeting in Gandhi Maidan in Patna. Before the meeting began, bombs went off at the venue and killed innocent people. In the face of this violence, he had behaved with exemplary restraint to calm the crowd, to prevent Bihar from descending into violence. He had said on that occasion that Hindus and Muslims had to make up their minds whether they wanted to fight poverty or each other.
 
Modi then attacked his political opponents, who having fled Patna at the time, unmindful of the violence being done to the capital, had arrogantly mocked his speech. This wasn't, he said, how politics should be done. Notice that the immediate rhetorical context of Modi's message in this speech is not the lynching (which is never mentioned) but the cynical, arrogant response of his political opponents in Bihar, in particular the then chief minister, to the bloody mayhem of that public meeting in 2013.
 
The country, said Modi, had to stay united; only unity, brotherhood and harmony and peace could take the nation forward. Petty men tried to advance their political self-interest by making nonsensical public statements. He asked his countrymen to ignore these statements, indeed to ignore Narendra Modi himself, if he were to make a statement of that kind. (Like all political narcissists, Modi enjoys referring to himself in the third person.)
 
He counselled his countrymen that if they were to attend to anyone they ought to attend to their President, Pranab Mukherjee, who, in a speech the previous day, had shown the right way. The politics of self-interest had to be transcended, the path shown by the President had to be followed and only then would India fulfill the expectations that the world had of it.
 
The speech is a study in self-righteousness, boilerplate and deflection. Mohammad Akhlaq's murder by a mob of gau rakshaks isn't mentioned, not even as a peg on which to hang his generalities about unity and harmony. That BJP members had been in the vanguard of the mob, that BJP party bearers, MLAs, MPs, and two union ministers had, variously, produced rationalisations for the lynching, dismissed it as an 'accident', exhorted the police to file an F.I.R. against the dead man and his ravaged family and persisted with the bogey of cow-slaughter in the face of all the evidence, was never even acknowledged.
 
One reason why people in general and the press in particular had lived in daily expectation of a prime ministerial intervention, was in the hope that Modi would call his party members and ministerial colleagues to account for their naked communal partisanship. Again, there wasn't a word of reproach in the speech for Nawab Singh Nagar, Srichand Sharma, Sangeet Som, Tarun Vijay, Mahesh Sharma and Sanjeev Baliyan, all of whom had been so solicitous of the mob's sensibilities about cow slaughter. Modi's speech was a date-less, place-less, fact-free condemnation of petty politicians who say stupid things to advance their selfish interests. If this speech amounts to Modi breaking his silence on the Dadri lynching, we might as well put it to more general use: perhaps it can represent his remorse for the Gujarat pogrom or even the BJP's mea culpa for the razing of the Babri Masjid? It has about as much to do with those horrors as it does with Akhlaq's murder: namely, nothing.
 
But isn't it unreasonable to expect a prime minister, a head of government, to refer to a single incident, however horrible, while drawing a larger lesson about virtuous politics and communal harmony? No, it isn't. Especially when his partymen choose to take sides in a hideous, bigoted murder. If Barack Obama could reach out by name to a young Muslim boy arrested and disciplined for taking a clock in to class, what Olympian perspective prevents Narendra Modi from reaching out to a family whose life has been destroyed by a hate-filled mob?
 
Still, isn't it a little literal-minded to insist that the Prime Minister name-check Dadri? Given the pressing context of the lynching, isn't an ishara enough? No. It's not enough. Narendra Modi deals in pious generalities - e.g. sabka saath, sabka vikas - without ever calling out the BJP's bigots for their fanaticism for a reason; it gives his genteel supporters a fig leaf with which to cover their nakedness while reassuring his base that he remains an unapologetically Hindu lohpurush. The Nawada speech was another variation on that sturdy theme.
 
Meanwhile, the BJP's cowboys continued to ride. Less than a week after the lynching, Sushil Modi, the leader of the BJP in Bihar, decided to use this new storm to fill his sails. The Bihar Assembly election, he declared "...is a fight between those who eat beef and those who are against cow slaughter... Now, people must decide whether they want beef-eaters or those who want to ban it."
 
The same day as the prime minister made his speech in Bihar, his party men in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly assaulted and collectively beat up an Independent MLA Engineer Rashid, inside the House for hosting a beef party the previous evening in the MLA hostel.
 
Characteristically, the same day as he made his much reported speech in Nawada, Narendra Modi himself made another speech in Begusarai where, inside ten days of Akhlaq being lynched for allegedly eating beef, he tried to make political mileage out of the sacred cow. Addressing himself to Yadavs, Laloo Yadav's core constituency, he announced that he came from Gujarat, Krishna's Dwarka, where the Lord himself taught Gujaratis their love for the cow.
 
Contrary to the headlines, then, the prime minister didn't break his silence on the Dadri lynching in Nawada; he used his speech (and, more culpably, the President's) to finesse a human tragedy.  Mukul Kesavan is a writer based in Delhi.

I suggest you get used to the fact that all the fetid hot air in his 56 inch chest is reserved for wretched abuse of those who for whatever reasons cant seem to hit back.....

                            one must remember the muzaffarnagar riots happened just before the general elections. They knew the importance of UP, so they sent their main criminal mastermind Amit Shah where he talked of 'badla' on the flimsy grounds of 'love jihad'. All the environment was severely vitiated. riots happened, communities became polarized and BJP strategy worked with hindutva pitting hindus irrespective of all caste calculations against the 'others', the muslims. The BJP made a rich haul of 80+ seats. Same is being tried in Bihar. Nitish said it right that they are trying to import Beef issue into Bihar. Bihar has already a law against cow slaughter. when modi saw that the 1.25 lakh package might not work, BJP completely shifted the discourse from development to communal issues. And BJP leaders have the nerve to say that media is politicizing the issue. What an irony!<br/>
 Biharis are the least developed lot in the country with more than half living in primitive like conditions. I have seen it myself, very pitiable conditions. Is this what the people want?   the most down trodden and oppressed the musahars eat mice. is it a developing india. Modi's silence is nothing but a tacit approval. why do you think these issues didn't figure before BJP's rise. Utterly disgusted by these people.

                            This is the RSS/BJP stategy. Junior leaders stoke communal hatred while senior leaders either stay mum or mouth platitudes. Even Modi used to use language like "hum paanch-humare pacchees " and other such slogans to incite communal hatred earlier, but now as PM he can't openly say such things so its left to juniors in his "Parivar" to do so.

I need action. I want to see him reprimand his leaders, I want him to commit to me and every Indian that this will never happen. I'm tired of his words and appeals now. <br/>
Today in India I'm scared of what I like to eat, because that can get me killed. I want my PM to commit to me that this will never happen. Words of wisdom will not do any more.

                            For the 100th time Modi has shown himself unfit to lead a secular nation. BJP politics is killing this country. This is one of India's darkest periods. Constitutional rights have been totally eroded. Human rights are being trodden over. Corruption in public life is rife. Frredom of speech does not exist. Modi needs to go.

                            reat harm has been done to the country by ideologues like the writer.They always speak in Majority/Minority framework.Their contribution in harmonising the society is negative. They are,mostly,agenda based ready to hire western influenced writers who seek acclaim fro their external masters.<br/>
 Our media,and affiliated foreign funded NGO's,  most of the time shows no concern for the <br/>
 disharmony contributed by them.<br/>
  MEDIA should have some self-regulatory mechanism which should periodically be subjected to the public discussion.By the way,most of our anchors do not comprehend correctly the basic issues. Their limited experience and education buttressed by their self-importance,and taking the debates quite often to the predetermined conclusions provide case studies of how ignorance trumps the reality.<br/>

And we now expect him to speak on the Dadri incident which involved just one Indian man being stoned to death ?  How can he speak against mad dogs and murderers of his own making ...

If the Indian Muslims are being targeted , then the people must look within themselves as to why so many crossed over, so to say, to that side. It is measure of the obscurantism that prevailed in the then society that people below the four classifications of the religion (four varnas or castes); yes . there were people below the four varnas, whose position in the society was even below than the lowest of the varnas and at the first available opportunity they had embraced another religious belief

Really I also wondering and listing to modi's speech again and again but I was unable to connect with it. It's very true PM is still silent on dadri terror attack. I'm a common man waiting to listen to some sympathetic words from my own PM,but every day my hopes gets scattered and that's makes me feel like second class citizens of the great decmocratic country India.

                            Why Dadri only? In last 16-17 months there are dozens of instances where people like you wanted Mr. Modi to comment. I think there some quick action which can relent 0.5% population of self styled intellectuals. (1) Every morning press conference by Mr. Modi with all Media owners and Leftist intellectual (2) Hanging all his party MLA, MP, party worker immediately as soon as Media reports their blabbering. No need for verification of facts, no need to check the context, and no need of even full sentence. (3) Stop foreign visit for remaining period of his tenure. In 2nd phase... He should visit Mosque or Church every week. Allow media on his all his official tour (domestic of course, as foreign visit is ruled out) with all expenses incurred by government. Ordinance to cancel right of free expression except Leftist liberals, abolishing judicial system and outsourcing it to media..... and many more. But first 3 immediate action must be taken without wasting a single second. Is it fine Mr. Keshvan ? At least to start with? ;)

                            Thanks Mukul for underlining how the PM is dodging an issue which, if not addressed on time, could radicalise and pose a serious threat from within by pitting one country man against another. We know that he has already succeeded, to some extent, in polarizing the nation on communal line. <br/><br/>
There is a pattern and design in his frighteningly steadfast silence over Dadri and this is not going to be a one off incident. Mr Modi is consciously avoiding the issue because he presides and mentors the perpetrators of such heinous religious philosophy and crime. He has done it in Gujarat and he is trying to replicate it nationally.<br/><br/>
As leader of the nation, the PM has a moral and constitutional duty and obligation to uphold and protect the plurality structure of India but instead his silence and deflection of the issue has emboldened the communal fascist elements. We do not want to see a nation developing into an intolerant society whose lanes and by-lanes are splattered with blood? Certainly, this is not the legacy we would want our children to inherit from us. The country needs to stand up as one and make him realize that his communal agenda, which he so successfully implemented in Gujarat, will not succeed elsewhere.<br/><br/>
A change in the political set up was much needed after all the scandals in UPA-2; but it has been a nightmarish one, and something that I regret. <br/><br/>
We cannot change a community's attitude or food habit by killing someone. By the way, for the information of Modi bhakts, I am a devout Krishna bhakt and an absolute vegetarian. <br/><br/>
May God bless India!

                            Shame on you mukul, writers like you are only knows to criticize. Modi is PM of our country, we elected him because we have faith on him. You want to say that crores of peoples in India are fools. I think you should start some descent job for earning and put your views in your kitchen dustbin.

                            Mr. Modi appears to take credit for all good things and pass or stay away from what is not so good. Being PM he hold accountability towards India and its secular fabrics. Such incident brings shame to our country and his silence encourages people by making them believe he support such act or they do not matter to him. Thank you Mukul for writing column Appreciate.

                            You are being deliberately naive here. It's not that the nation is keen to listen to his dramatics; and by the way we have had enough of it in such a short period of time of his PMship. <br/><br/>
As leader of the nation, the PM has a moral and constitutional duty and obligation to uphold and protect the plurality of India but instead his silence and deflection of the issue is emboldening the communal fascist elements. Would you like to see a nation fill with bloodshed, and we have enough examples of it in the global theatre, and bring up your children in an atmosphere of hate and violence.<br/><br/>
He has deliberately allowed these elements to raise their heads and let them destroy the social fabric, which has been holding itself despite trying times in the past, because that seems to be his agenda. He succeeded doing the same in Gujarat and he is trying to replicate it everywhere.<br/><br/>
I thought a change was much needed after the corruption scandals in UPA-2; but the change has been a nightmarish one which could have a serious threat to India as a nation.<br/><br/>
May God bless India

                            For some strange &amp; vested reasons "secularists" have set different benchmark for the current PM.<br/>
1) MMS or Soniaji didnt mention a word on 84 riots for full 20yrs till MMS became PM. No Q asked!<br/>
2) No regret or accountabilty on Hashimpura massacre or Bhagalpur riots. Stony silence. No Q<br/>
3) Diggy Raja &amp; Salman Kurshid said Soniaji weeped when she heard of Batla encounter. No acountability if false encounter NOR word from Soniaji if genuine encounter<br/>
4) No Q to UP govt of beating of Sadhus &amp; Cong MLA arested.But PM responsible if fmly member a panchayat level BJP worker allegedly involved. In Cong even PM not responsible for scam in a case where he puts signature on the file<br/>
5) Sahitya academy awardee (award recd in 1986) had no issue with mass killings of muslims in Hashimpura 1987 or Bhagalpur 1989, because as per her own quotes it was done by secular govt! But objection for present 1-man murder which as per done under a Hindutva govt!<br/>

                            If anyone believes cow as a sacred animal, he has all the rights to hate who violates that. Just like a muslim hates one who eats a pig. Attacking someone else on this is certainly provocative, but eating beef in a Hindu majority area is also provocative. Writing articles blaming Hindus, blaming prime minister is easy since nobody actually check how moral these so called journalists are. Nobody checks their accountabilities. But blaming just one community will not lead you anywhere that's for sure. And this is the reason you should cry for better law and order instead of blaming Hindus. There are at least a dozen muslim countries at present where for eating ham one can land up in prison or deportation!!

                            Does Modi have to satisfy his constituency or hacks like Kesavan with an exaggerated sense of nationalism and secularism? Modi is the PM to all Indians including the likes of Kesavan. It is for him to decide on where, when and what to speak. There are several issues on which he does not speak and his silence speaks volumes. When Narasimha Rao was once asked why he had a reputation for not taking decisions, he replied that the decision not to take a decision was a decision by itself! Rao was also famous for his silences. And Rao was the man who led India's economic renaissance. A PM need not speak on every issue. Only those which he considers necessary to speak upon. And remember,nobody ever charged Modi with being indecisive.

None expects more than that? "Copy and paste" - a main contribution of IT industry now used to rules the state.

I have tried to tell my fellow beings that even if he mentioned in the rarest view of dadri he was doing so for the sake of votes as the platform used was a "Political Campaign" and NOT a statement from an Independent platform. <br/><br/>
So whatever he mentions gives no accountability and credibility. Its SAD for a democracy. <br/><br/>

                            Idea of media person being super human and human being super specie is bad for global eco system and particularly local eco system. Pillars of local eco system are disappearing silently due to practicing faith completely unfit for local ecosystem. Systematic elimination of cow family, elephant family and insistence to mind less breading of humans is dangerous to the local ecosystem. So called thinking and intelligent media persons are more focussed of short term events. He better should also dig the reasons for distorted local ecosystem due to politics of appeasement for sustained long term.

Half of the Indians don't have common sense. They are good at bhed chal.<br/><br/>
And what if he says it was not right? then what next thing these presstitutes will say is his government is a failure..even after disapproving the incidents are not stopping?<br/><br/>

                            Damned if he does, Damned if he doesn't. Everyone knew that no matter what Modi says the liberals and intellectuals will find somethings punch a hole into. The reason is simple. Liberals want Modi to say what they feel and what they want him to speak. He is his own man. For years, Modi doesn't go into the hindu-muslim speak which is what liberals want him to say.<br/><br/>
I don't see what was wrong with what Modi said. He didn't say hindu's and muslims with regard to Dadri but said Hindu's and muslims have to fight poverty. He asked INDIANS to not bother about what POLITICIANS say to divide people. The problem Kesavan has is Modi didn't say the word Dadri and didn't take names of politicians belonging to BJP. Note that Kesavan has no problem with Azam Khan talking bout UN and OWaisi but only takes BJP names. If Modi had taken Sangeeta Som's, Sakshi Maharaja &amp; Yogi Adityanath names along with Azam &amp; Owaisi this guy would still crib that PM has politicised the issue. <br/><br/>
So called liberals are the biggest commuanls. First they keep talking about Hindu's and muslims , never about INDIANS.<br/><br/>
Then they want only BJP politicians to be scolded by the PM.<br/><br/>
Then they want the word Dadri to be specifically used by Modi.<br/><br/>
And after all this Modi is communal!

                            Kesavan sahib.. Why not you become prime minister and teach everybody how to behave. Perhaps you should knock Rahul Gandhi and take over the opposition? If you can't do that, which you evidently can't - you should just join us backseat drivers, constant naggers and haters - and write comments like I do since you're not much different than the rest of us.. Oh but then, you know how great politicians behave! Kesavan for PM!

                            Every person is talking about secular secular. What this secular means Muslims and Christans. What about Hindus no body cares for them i guess.

                            People with jaundiced eyes always see yellow! Mr.Mukul,so you want the PM to comment on all murders which happen individually,including the one on the 4yr old whose father strangled her (the same day as Dadri) for not wearing the burkah? The major who was shot for intervening in a cow theft? While it is clear the agenda to brand BJp communal, these incidents happened much more during UPA but was under-reported. Great example beef ban has been in force for decades,but is being exaggerated now.

                            When clashes happen due to religious beliefs then Modi should generalise. It is the duty of media not to do selective treatment to an issue. Being secular is not only bashing anti Muslims. For instance why the cases like a Hindu lady burnt alive in mirapur was not reported or or given importance by media. That also causes riots but since Hindu died it was ignored or it will not get the required TRP's or hits to the blog like these. Presstitutes is the word for them.

                            didn't someone inform the PM that it would not do to condemn the incident and advice his countrymen to do better but that he also has to choose his words and opinions to suit mr.kesavans lofty ideals just right?
