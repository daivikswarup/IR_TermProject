Headline::::Dear Government, We Don't Need a Nanny

	(Ashok Malik is a columnist and writer living in Delhi.)
	It was in the mid-1980s that Margaret Thatcher famously spoke of denying terrorists the "oxygen of publicity". True, this was and is easier said than done. Terrorists - or even every day criminals - resort to actions that are newsy by their occurrence and a certain share of the headlines and of prime time is inevitable.
	Yet, some decisions are not as clear-cut. A documentary film-maker's interview of Mukesh Singh, one of the six men who raped and caused the death of a Delhi paramedic on December 16, 2012, leaves one with mixed feelings. By all accounts, the documentary cannot be accused of glamorising him, as previous interviews of killers such as Charles Manson, who murdered the pregnant movie star Sharon Tate in 1969, were charged with doing. Nevertheless, the documentary has allowed Singh to more or less traduce his victim and make completely obnoxious and unacceptable remarks about women in general and the person he brutalised in particular.Is there news interest in this? To be sure there is and will be. The documentary will be watched, perhaps more so now than previously because of the controversy. Are Singh's views representative of Indian society? At least this writer is not sure and wouldn't want to make a sweeping assertion. Granted, India is not fair to its women and there is a definite patriarchal and even misogynistic streak in sections of our society. Even in this framework, though, Singh's essential argument - 'If a women is so much as walking down the road, she's asking for it' - makes him an outlier. Prejudice is regrettable, at times abhorrent; but all prejudice does not automatically translate to criminality.
	Ultimately the choice of interviewing a disreputable, downright evil subject and placing his words and actions in an appropriate context is that of the journalist or film-maker. It is a subjective call. For instance, Ram Gopal Varma made an appalling film (Not a Love Story) on the Neeraj Grover murder case that was voyeuristic and did little but attempt to titillate.
	India's Daughter is, of course, a journalistic documentation and not a fictionalised feature film. It is evoking strong reactions from the government and the political class because it is regarded as quite extraordinary that the film crew was allowed to interview Singh in Delhi's Tihar Jail in 2013 and record his words at such length. Whoever took that decision erred terribly. It is the media's job to try and cover a crime and a criminal as it wants. It is not the government's job to facilitate publicity for a convict in such a reckless manner.
	Having said that, the demand for a ban or a restriction in telecast - whether placed by the executive or the judiciary - is silly and anyway impracticable. Those who suggest India's reputation and tourism potential will be damaged by the film make no sense. Indian authorities cannot possibly stop release of the film in other countries. As for Indians themselves, let them watch the film - or not watch it, if they so want - and think for themselves. They don't need the nanny state.
	It is not as if censorship or the power to limit access is absolutely unnecessary. That may be the libertarian ideal but hard-core pornography, child pornography, certain types of bestial violence and depictions that threaten national or public security will always invite a clamp down, and one that most people can live with.
	To apply that standard to a documentary that seeks to interrogate a pressing social phenomenon - safety of women, at least safety of women in urban areas in India; attitudes towards women and rape, as expressed by not just Singh but also his lawyers, even outside the court-room, in a private capacity - is ridiculous.
	As it happens, this "Daddy knows best" attitude of governments and those in authority is becoming distressingly familiar in India. The newly-announced censor board has made a laughing stock of itself by framing a list of allegedly "objectionable" words that would amount to sanitising cinema. Some years ago, as information and broadcasting minister, Priyaranjan Das Munishi actually held up the release of Da Vinci Code even after the film certification authorities had cleared it. He said the film would only be shown to the public when he (Das Munshi) had watched it in the company of Catholic priests and secured their blessing.
	The name "India's Daughter" is reminiscent of American writer Katherine Mayo's Mother India (1927), an infamous screed that sought to mock India and undermine the struggle for freedom from Empire. It is worth remembering how the Mahatma responded to the exaggerated criticism by Mayo, who nevertheless pointed out several of India's social and physical ills. Far from angering him, this triggered Gandhi into action. He buried himself deep into an ugly and hostile book rather than asked people to not read it, much less ban it.
	"Throughout his celebrated Salt March ... and later campaigns," wrote Thomas Weber in Going Native, his book on Gandhi's interaction with a series of western women, "the focus was not merely on an India free from the British, but a certain sort of India - one that was free from the blemishes pointed out in Mother India ... The amount of energy he spent on commenting on the book, even years later, shows an almost obsessive relationship with Katherine Mayo and Mother India."
	In short, the Mahatma reacted not with pride and prejudice but sense and sensibility. If only we could respond to India's Daughter as the great man did to Mother India.

                            India cannot remove evils of its society unless it has the courage to understand every view point, including that of victims as well as perpetrators. Only then would the real solutions to real problems be found.

                            Great post. Thank you for a sensible view.Our instinctive reaction seems to be to sweep all grime and dirt under the carpet. The ban will make sure most of our country men, who need to see this will not be able to and the country carry on as it is. And all foreigners can see it and have its opinions and stereotypes about Indians any way. So long as we are not able to confront it we will never get rid of this social ills.

                            The best way to deal with any problem is to confront it. The first step towards confrontation is to realize that there is a problem. Indian authorities always seem to take the shortcut of avoiding a problem than confront it. <br/><br/>
Indian citizens are no longer naive for the government or a few select people to decide what is good or what is bad. They are very well capable of making the decision for themselves. I have seen pleasant campaigns on television on the subject of equality for women right from my childhood. Over the years these dont seem to have made any impact on the society. People must be made aware of the harsh reality and how abysmal the thinking of a large section of our society is which is exactly what the documentary tries to achieve.  <br/><br/>
People who think this documentary is going to affect tourism / international image of India must be ashamed as they are still living in denial. Please go an visit some government website of other countries and what they say about traveling to India to their citizen. Enough damage has been done already and there is not much the documentary can do to make it worse!

                            India today does not have even ONE man who is an iota of the Mahatma, let alone be compared with him. The Mahatma was never a politician in the true sense of the word, but rather a social and political revolution on two legs with an iron mind. One wonders if the India he dreamt of and desired had a place for such elements, and how he would have dealt with it.

                            Being a person of Indian origin residing abroad such as in Canada like me, I have a different perspective to airing this 'controversial documentary'. No doubt this documentary would make every watcher condemn the opinion or remarks made by Mukesh Singh. But please just think what would be the take-away message by the people from developed nations (say, Canadians, Americans and Europeans) after they watch this documentary. I am so sure that they would all think that India as a nation is filled with 'slum dogs' and men with rapist mentality and disrespect for women. This take-home message forms a 'blanket statement' about all Indians living in India as well as outside. The 'slum dog millionaire' movie has already caused ample embarrassment and damage to all the so far earned 'Indian' image for us here. Now that Mr. Modi has forced developed countries to rethink 'good' about Indians with his charismatic image and trying to get the growth engine back on track, this documentary would likely embarrass us again instead of conveying the genuine message of the documentary. Some of these politicians, columnists and journalists who are now criticizing the 'ban' may need to be ready to feel ashamed or embarrassed when travel abroad. Tourism sector seems likely to incur some losses. Just imagine if an Indian film maker goes to a developed country and picks up a socially demeaning topic and makes a film, I would doubt that any such country with REAL patriotic people would ever allow its publication. Like it or not, so, I along with many others of my view proudly stand by the Indian Govt's stand of banning this documentary. <br/>
India needs to wonder as to why do these foreign film makers get attracted to India to make movies like 'slum dog', 'India's daughter' and others when such incidents do happen in their countries too and in fact, in some places, deliberately not or under reported. Ironically, some Indian film makers pick up some Indian issues (embarrassing) and make movies such as 'water' and others to compete for international awards.

                            Superb articulation! what the previous government sought to shove under the carpet came back to haunt them. The new government should beware that they came to power on the plank of intelligent communication and a more confident generation willing to exchange ideas. This is far too serious an issue and the documentary appears a serious effort at dealing with it.

                            Will this woman if really sane make a film on serial gang rapes of UK by criminals of pak and somali origin? No!  <br/><br/>
How about rapes in B-desh in 1971? She wont!! Those in U.S military surely not. <br/><br/>
How about colleges of USA? She wont dare!!! It is clear she is preying on our vulnerability.  The minor isn this <br/><br/>
incident was not a Hindu; is the film saying about him?  How about rapes in Gaya, Shakti Mills, Assam, etc.

                            For once, I don't agree with you. I think of impressionable teenagers, who live in huts, with no opportunity, no hope and teenagers who have attitudes like Mukesh Singh. These teenagers might just see Mukesh as a hero and want to be like him - and taking his advice to make sure that they kill after the rape. I'm assuming the movie will be translated / dubbed.  Secondly, this movie will hurt tourism - all Indians are like this, they'll think. After all 250 MP's are accused of rape!

                            I agree with Mr Ashok Malik. The example of Mahatma Gandhi and Katherine Mayo's book Mother India is a superb one and worth emulating for people in public life. The extent to which banning can be used in today's well connected online world is very limited anyway and becomes even more so if the justifications for doing so are nebulous
