Headline::::At 12, I Was Moved From India To The US. How I Coped.



DateTime::::2016-02-04T23:16:00+05:30




                                The first morning I woke up in America, I could smell bacon frying. I was nearly 12 years old. I had spent the night sleeping in the living room of a family friend. His wife was cooking us breakfast in the adjoining kitchen when I opened my eyes. It was a week of many firsts for me. I had flown on a plane for the first time. I had traveled anywhere outside India for the first time. Even now, 33 years later, that is the smell of America to me. If I get too complacent about my sense of belonging here - my ability to speak, dress, look, think like an American - I only need to smell bacon frying and I am a newly-arrived immigrant again. I had never had bacon before that morning. I smelled it, heard it sizzling and crackling, before I tasted it. It was a complex animal smell, making my mouth water and my stomach churn in revulsion at the same time.
A few years ago, when my middle son asked me of my first memories of arriving in this country, I told him about the bacon smell. "Were you happy, Mama?" he asked me, then perhaps nine years old. He was learning about immigration in his school and the homework assignment was to interview an immigrant. An easy assignment for him since his home was filled with them. No, I wasn't happy, I told him. Suddenly he was on alert.
Immigration was a joyful tale he had been taught in school. Immigrants are to be celebrated. I was sad, I told him softly, because I had to leave behind all my friends and relatives. This was the early 1980s. Before we had cheap cell phones, the Internet, and social media. This was in the last century - the era of aerogrammes and trunk calls in India. For those in economically straitened circumstances, the imagination was the best possible mobile device for conjuring up the home left behind. I missed our little one-bedroom home in Calcutta. I missed my school, my neighborhood. I missed the cows that slept on the sidewalk outside our main door, the stray dogs that barked all night, the harsh sound of the crows. The silence of the American streets made me homesick. At first, each season brought unfamiliar sensations. When I walked to the bus stop or to the laundromat with my mother, everyone seemed to be inside their house doing things I did not quite understand. And a little part of me felt humiliated - even though I did not know how to give a name and shape to that shame - that my parents had to leave the country of my birth for economic reasons. I cried into my pillow and in locked bathrooms. I missed being able to speak in my mother tongue everywhere I went.
A friend of my father gave me my first American book. It was called The Stranger and was written by a man whose name I read in my mind as Kamooose but was told by the friend - a childless man who mercifully did not give me reading-grade appropriate books - that I was pronouncing it incorrectly. I did not like the book but read diligently because it made me sad to read about a man whose mother had died and who went to jail. There was no happy ending. It matched my own un-nameable mood. It was in English - though upon later inspection I found it was not written in English at first - and I wanted to make sure my English was very good because I had overheard my parents worrying if my language skills were up to snuff for American schools. My shimmering linguistic world of Bengali now shrunk to the confines of our little attic apartment furnished largely with things others had discarded. I missed the food we ate everyday even though before we left I did not think that food was anything special.
Noticing that my little interviewer was getting visibly unsettled by these thoughts, I quickly focused on giving him a more upbeat ending. Yes, immigration can be a good news story. I switched to the third person. "Mama made many friends here. She learned to speak like everyone else. She got used to the food. She went to school and got jobs. And now she has you and your brother and your sister and your father and she is not lonely anymore. We can all learn to adapt when we move to a new place. And even if we are sad at first, we can eventually be happy. Just like you can be happy if you have to leave this place one day."
Â 
"Whaaaat? I have to immigrate one day?" Clearly my happy ending made my interviewer even more unhappy. "Maybe you will have to go find a job in another country," I replied. "Like where?" asked a scared boy who had been taught that the American immigrant story is heroic and Ellis Island is a cherished landmark, but who had never been taught that one day he too might have to go learn a new language, eat new food, become a foreigner somewhere. America is the last and final destination. City on a Hill. Promised Land. It is where everyone wants to come. And when they come here, they find happiness, equality of opportunity, and freedom. This is how the school textbooks are written.
In the more progressive school districts of America, immigration is enthusiastically included in the curriculum as part of national history. This year, as the Republican anti-immigrant rhetoric is more thunderous than I have ever encountered in my 33 years in the United States, liberal politicians and school districts are countering with equally adamant celebration of immigrants. But one aspect of this celebration always gives me pause. Why do we only celebrate immigration as an arrival? What about emigrants and departures? Should we stop at teaching our children to welcome strangers among us? Or, do we also teach them that one day they too might be strangers in a strange land - pushed around the globe by forces of economics, politics, or nature?
Researchers tell us that temporary migrants outnumber permanent migrants worldwide. That is, people do not simply move from one country to another and stay put. Most migrants are seasonal and keep shuttling between two or more places. But where I live in the U.S., we focus mostly on permanent migration, that too in one direction. This, of course, has to do with the historical reality of this country as well as with its foundational myth. Yet, populations have been on the move - in large numbers or small groups, voluntarily or involuntarily (the difference is remarkably difficult to parse as human rights lawyers will tell us) - since the beginning of human history. Perhaps my children will wake up one morning in a city half way across the world to an unfamiliar smell emanating from a kitchen. They might wake up with great joy for having reached a cherished destination. Or they might wake up with a lump in their throat for they have left behind a familiar world. I want them to know that they - like their ancestors before them - will find success and failure, love and disappointment, and eventually go on to welcome other strangers in their new home.
We have truly arrived only when we are willing to consider departure.(Sharmila Sen is Executive Editor-at-Large at Harvard University Press.

                            What a load of bull crap. Looks like the author has major depression issues. There is  high probability that she would still be sad had she stayed put in Calcutta (although she would be more poor). Do the humanity a favour and trade your green card with a potential immigrant who would actually value and would celebrate his immigrant life in America. Totally ruined my mood first thing in the morning.

                            The classic immigrant story. But really, there is no place like home. An Indian in America, even if fourth generation immigrant, will always be an outsider. The chances of integrating into white America are rather dim, however hard you try. Finally you end up losing your identity and your dignity. See the classic case of Bobby Jindal. Converting to Christianity or changing your name will not help you amalgamate or lighten your skin tone.

                            I can sympathize with the author but her experience is not the norm for immigrants. It was perhaps a combination of the fact that she was only 12 and had no say in the move and also her personality which seems to see the glass as half empty. I moved to America in 1999 when I was 21 and approached it as an adventure and totally enjoy it here. There are definitely things you cannot find here but plane tickets are cheap(in economy) and I travel at least one or twice a year to India and enjoy the things there. Most of my friends are that way though they don't go to India as much. I can WhatsApp with my cousins in India, follow my undergrad friends on FB, Skype with my parents and grandma and it is not very different than if I lived in a far away Indian city. When we really miss India, my American girlfriend and I watch Makkal TV on the Internet or Tamil comedies on youtube and call my mother and make some poories to remind us of her cooking. Also most immigrants who came before the 1990s were not able to be connected via the Internet and don't go back as much so they don't realize how much things have changed. I badly wanted to live in Bangalore or another big city when I was young. These days when I am in India I cannot wait to get out of the big cities with their pollution and traffic and spend time in a small town or village. You can get wireless internet at 15Mbps at the village where my parents live and HD/4K satellite transmissions. So look on the bright side of life wherever you are and try to enjoy it!

                            To all the people criticizing her - remember she was recollecting her first experience -  she was a child when she landed in US. Children's perceptions are different, their needs different. And of course she does say it gets better, and in her case it definitely did.<br/><br/>
Anyway, The main point she is trying to convey is that America is not the ultimate immigrant destination forever - it is now (or at least perceived) but it will change, and Americans who grow up believing their land is the 'best' need to realize that eventually they will also be looking to migrate to some other country.

                            Very nicely written. I am immigrant to usa and came here at age 22. I dont share the sentiments though. Looks like author never assimilated in society or doesnt appreciate american culture. Which is quite rich by the way if you have open mind.

                            .Do the media  give so much importance to the personal accounts of so many educated Indians who are serving the society here facing lot of challenges ????<br/>
There are millions of Indian- Amercians who would give umpteen tales of their adaptability and challenges faced ..<br/>
Obviously their parents or themselves  took a cautious decision to migrate weighing pros over cons  and hence they should have known that there would be confusions and  identity problems for the next generations born there  ..<br/>
..but still they chose to  migrate looking for what they think as *greener pastures * and she is one among them ..<br/>
so there is no point in discussing their challenges because they their family themselves made the decisions . <br/>
Kindly publish Inspiring  accounts of resident Indians who are serving the Indians living here

                            Mayank: You have right to have your opinion. You can celebrate the having of green card when you come as an adult in USA because you think that immigration to US is pure GOLD. But when a girl or boy of 12-13 years come along with parents, they may be nostalgic about the previous tastes, belongings, friends, streets, cows on streets, crowds. It is necessary what means to you will mean to others.So problem is not with Sharmila Sen, problem is with mood of your who may be spoil his morning and so reactionary attitude. Dear please don't feel offended.

                            You don't have to travel to another part of the world to feel this way. My grand father had moved to a Metro city and since then we are 4 generations living in this city. Still, by and large i see people referring to each other based on the place of origin. The problem is the new generations are confused because they have either never been to their place of origin or they cant even relate to them but still they are made to feel it!!! ... Outside the country as well its the same story!!!

                            No generalisation please! I am first generation immigrant who moved 15 years back and my teenage kids have really done well in the UK and integrated well, and yet we are proud of our Indian roots and culture. Only people who do not integrate well make a bit too much noise about things like racism. If smell of bacon can be exaggerated to such extent so can be the smell of a lot of Indian food, this article is really stupid and dim witted tbh!
