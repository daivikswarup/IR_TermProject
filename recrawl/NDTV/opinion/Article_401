Headline::::The Staggering Vanity of India's Powerful



DateTime::::2015-02-07T05:07:00+05:30



(Ramachandra Guha is a historian, biographer, author of, among other books, Gandhi before India, A Corner of a Foreign Field: The Indian history of a British sport and India after Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy.)
	After Narendra Modi's recent meeting with Barack Obama, there was some criticism of his wearing a suit whose stripes spelt out his own name. The criticism was not unmerited; it was a tawdry, tacky, thing to do. Yet Modi's expensive display of self-love was entirely characteristic of how powerful and successful Indian males tend to behave in public.
	Consider this. India's most famous and highly decorated scientist is C.N.R. Rao, a Fellow of the world's most prestigious scientific academies, and a recipient of his country's highest honour, the Bharat Ratna. Some years ago, an admirer decided to lobby the Bangalore Municipality to name the circle outside the Indian Institute of Science (of which Rao had been director) after the great man. Now circles and roads are normally not named after living people. But here was C.N.R. Rao in the flesh, actually present when a circle named after him was being inaugurated.
	Next only to Rao in the hierarchy of Indian science is R.A. Mashelkar. Mashelkar is a former director general of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, a Fellow of the Royal Society, and much else. He has not, so far as I know, had a circle or building named after himself. Yet his conduct in public is scarcely less boastful, as witness his editorial in a recent issue of the journal, Current Science. Entitled '"Indovation" for affordable excellence', it is mostly about the author himself. In a mere couple of pages we are told of a paper by Mashelkar in the Harvard Business Review which "provoked worldwide discussion" and was the subject of a "special session" at the World Economic Forum; that a TED lecture he gave "has received more than half a million views and has been subtitled in 23 languages"; that Mashelkar is the president of something called the Global Research Alliance; that the European Union invited him to give a talk to "an audience of around 2000"; that when he was director general of the CSIR he set up "a public-private partnership called New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative".Mashelkar's article runs so contrary to the spirit of science that I wonder how it was accepted for publication. How did the editor of Current Science allow the essay to pass without major cuts and changes? Either the editor is plain incompetent, or, what is more likely, too intimidated by Mashelkar's reputation and influence to have asked him to revise his essay.
	Founded by C.V. Raman, Current Science is modelled on the American journal, Science, and the British journal, Nature. Like them, it publishes original scientific papers as well as shorter commentaries, book reviews, and obituaries. But one would never find in Nature or Science editorials remotely as self-promoting as this. As he was crafting his essay, did Mashelkar not realize that this was not a self-written Wikipedia entry or a funding application but in fact a scholarly editorial in what is presumed to be the flagship journal of a nation's scientific community? Reading Mashelkar's editorial in Current Science, I was reminded of a story involving the great British-born biologist, J.B.S. Haldane. In the 1950s, Haldane embraced Indian citizenship, and set up a laboratory at the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta. One of his students bored him with stories about his impending marriage, his family lineage, and his own academic record. At last Haldane held up a hand, and remarked: "You only talk about yourself.
	But science begins with an interest in the world outside yourself." To be sure, not all Indian scientists are as boastful as Rao or Mashelkar. One of my own intellectual heroes is the late Obaid Siddiqi, who founded theNational Centre for Biological Sciences, arguably India's most high quality scientific laboratory. Siddiqi, who combined intellectual brilliance with personal rectitude, recruited a team of gifted young scientists and then left them the institute to run. He nurtured an atmosphere of egalitarianism in the NCBS, where juniors could fearlessly challenge seniors and where honorifics such as 'Sir', 'Professor'. were rigorously eschewed. Sadly, not many Indian scientists are cut of the same cloth as Obaid Siddiqi. In their youth, C.N.R. Rao and R.A. Mashelkar undoubtedly did first-rate scientific work. But, rather than allow younger people to take over scientific leadership as they themselves grew older, they consolidated their own position and power. Worse still, they encouraged flattery and chamchagiri, as manifested most spectacularly in Rao allowing a circle to be named after him.
	Where our scientists go, our social scientists can scarcely be far behind. Consider the conduct in this regard of the two most influential economists of Indian extraction, Jagdish Bhagwati and Amartya Sen. Educated Indians know their names, and know also that they have been involved in a long-running debate about economic policy. Bhagwati is a proponent of the free market, and of opening out the economy to foreign investment and foreign competition. Sen thinks that distribution is as important as growth, and places greater emphasis on the role of the State in nurturing human capital. At the level of political influence, Sen was highly regarded by Sonia Gandhi and her National Advisory Council, whereas Bhagwati is much admired by Narendra Modi.
	These intellectual and ideological differences have led to the construction of Bhagwati and Sen as rivals and adversaries. But there is one thing that unites Bhagwati and Sen- both are still living, and yet both, like the scientist C.N.R. Rao, have had things named after themselves. Bhagwati has taught for many years at Columbia University, which now has a Jagdish Bhagwati Chair in Political Economy, occupied by Bhagwati's co-author and protege, Arvind Panagriya. Meanwhile, the Indian Council of Social Science Research has endowed annual Amartya Sen Prizes for Excellence, these handed out at a ceremony presided over by Amartya Sen himself.
	B.R. Ambedkar famously said that hero-worship is antithetical to the democratic spirit. This is true in politics, and perhaps even more so in the sphere of science. Respect for senior scholars for what they have achieved is fine; but when respect shades into deference and even reverence, it is not conducive to independent and original thinking. No wonder that Indian universities and research institutions lag so far behind in global rankings.
	While drafting this column, I was discussing its argument with a friend, who asked whether, like C.N.R. Rao, the cricketer Anil Kumble was present at the naming of a circle after him in Bangalore. I answered that I did not know, but in any case one did not hold sportsmen to the ethical or aesthetic standards that scholars or scientists were supposed to adhere to. One of Jagdish Bhagwati's own close friends and former colleagues is Robert Solow. When Solow (arguably the world's greatest living economist) was teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, did someone else at the MIT hold the Robert Solow Chair in Political Economy? Like Amartya Sen, Martin Rees was once Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. But does that distinguished British astronomer annually hand out Martin Rees Prizes for Scientific Excellence? These were -are -the pertinent questions, and I suspect that in each case the answer is "No".
	In allowing (or encouraging) things to be named after themselves, C.N.R. Rao, Amartya Sen and Jagdish Bhagwati have not done anything that is illegal. What they have done is not even immoral. But it is unquestionably in poor taste.
	Which brings me back to Narendra Modi and the suit he wore with his own name on it. In societies whose spirit and form are egalitarian, or where the aesthetic ethos is one of refined understatement, what he did would be completely out of place. But in a country where hero worship is so ubiquitous, where the vanity of the powerful and the famous is so staggeringly large, it was an entirely normal thing to do. When India's top scholars and scientists are so flagrantly narcissistic, one must not be too harsh on a self-made, semi-educated, political leader for being so.(Source: The Telegraph)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            This is brilliant. The problem is with our hierarchical culture and looking up to and worshiping famous people. When the same people are in USA, they are the very picture of modesty and humility, because Americans do not accept or encourage such behavior. When they come to India, their attitude instantly changes. They stop doing research and start encouraging chamchagiri. Guha is famous enough to hang out with such guys, so it is good that he takes them down a notch so nicely here. Well done! Kudos from a mango man!

                            In 1963 , the great Rajaji and the first Bharata Ratna , dressed in dhoti and kurta went to the USA and met the then president of the USA , John Kennedy to plead for nuclear disarmament and postponement of nuclear testing , which was acceded to by the president of the USA . It is substance , which matters rather than embellishment of non-substance with glitter and tinsel.

                            Love the article for its simplicity and directness. Mr. Guha is not afraid of taking on powerful people and stating whats on his mind. I agree that Humility is the single most important trait of a great leader whether political or intellectual. I am a big fan of Prof Jagdish Bhagwati and hence I am surprised that he too has depicted such behaviour. I guess it is the age of marketing and perceptions.

                            At the very end Ram Guha betrays his own prejudices by calling Modi semi-educated. Not that it isn't true in the academic sense, but what is actually revealed here is that Guha is afflicted with the same disease which afflicts people of his class, the "liberal intellectuals" of this country, namely, the tendency to look down upon, or consider unworthy of high office, persons who haven't had the opportunity to get an academic education that would grant them entry into the rarefied company to which Guha belongs.<br/><br/>
But don't you worry, Mr. Guha. Modi has had plenty of education, only it is not of the kind that your sort would approve. In the school of life as a tea vendor, and later on in the villages of this country which he roamed for many years as a pracharak, Modi has had plenty of the training that imparts to its student the wisdom of life, the ability to think on your feet, the humility that comes from poverty, the intimate knowledge of how life is lived in the villages of this country, peoples' aspirations, their hopes, their despair, their sorrows and in short, the ability to feel the soul of this ancient land.<br/><br/>
You see, Mr. Guha, the education that Modi has received is something that his limited schooling has not interfered with, unlike in your unfortunate case. That same education taught him to remain calm when bombs were going off around him in Patna. Not sure that you or your favourite anarchist can manage it. God forbid, but if war were imposed on this country, I would rather entrust the destiny of this nation to a man like that rather than a professional secularist.<br/><br/>
I would trust a semi-educated man like Modi, striped suits, unsophisticated, thickly accented ungrammatical english and all, more than a "fully educated" man from your flock with clipped accent. We've endured enough of that, so no thanks.<br/><br/>
Finally, it is about time you got off that high horse, Mr. Guha. You are looking quite clownish on it.

                            Suit wore by PM Modi was gifted by his admirer and he wore it only a single occasion and many people in India have their names embedded on their gold ornaments so how is it different from that. <br/><br/>
Now, its hypocrisy on your part to target scientists when you have lot of politicians naming public schemes, public institutions on their names. For eg. Indira Gandhi, Nehru awarded Bharat Ratna to themselves. All the schemes announced by Congress were named after Gandhi's family. Till now I haven't seen that happening by Modi's government. Also, I don't think PM Modi had any scheme named after him when he was the CM of Gujarat.

                            I am reminded of a similar situation - when Russi Mody was the numero uno at Tata Steel, the newly built Tata convention centre/centre of learning and also the Tata archive in Jamshedpur was ceremoniously named Russi Mody Centre of Excellence - grandly inaugurated by Mody himself. Once Mody fell out of favour and was booted out of the Tatas, the building used to be quietly referred to as RMCE; since referring to Russi Mody using his full name was a strict no-no. Later it was rechistened as Tata Centre of Excellence; I do not know if any living Tata grandly inaugurated it (not that many are left to do that).

                            Mr Guha is confused with facts here. I guess if he was making a point that naming memorials/buildings/halls/circles after living people is in poor taste, you could accept it. But when he brings in the point that the west don't do it, especially the scientific community and third world countries (read India) does it; his ignorance has clouded his rationale. Mr Guha, just find out the number of buildings in MIT that are named after living scientists. Find out number of naval ships of the U.S. named after US living politicians etc. Yes it could be narcissistic to love your name printed on public structure etc but it is not limited to India as you claim.if CNR Rao curbed talent, mention those specifically. But don't use a name on the circle to extrapolate wrongly "it doesn't happen in the scientific community of the west". Yes, there is huge sycophancy here in epic proportions, but the west has it too.

                            Completely disagree with your poorly researched article. According to your weird theory Albert Einstein was a narcissist too!!! I expected more logical explanation - at least from you.<br/><br/>
From Wikipedia:<br/><br/>
The Albert Einstein Award (sometimes called the Albert Einstein Medal because it is accompanied with a gold medal) is an award in theoretical physics, established to recognize high achievement in the natural sciences. It was endowed by the Lewis and Rosa Strauss Memorial Fund in honor of Albert Einstein's 70th birthday. It was first awarded in 1951 and included a prize money of $15,000,[22][23] which was later reduced to $5,000.[24][25] The winner is selected by a committee (the first of which consisted of Einstein, Oppenheimer, von Neumann and Weyl[26]) of the Institute for Advanced Study, which administers the award.<br/><br/>
Einstein died in Princeton Hospital on 18 April 1955.

This is a bogus article. The author wanted to criticize BJP and Modi so he picked a couple of other names as well to make his article appear fair.

Of all people, for Guha to apparently assess 'education' in terms of acronymous University degrees is galling. Or is this just another opportunity to take a dig at Modi, the current favourite  pastime of our exalted 'intellectuals'.

What would you say about the great GR Vishwanath - considered by all Indian cricket lovers and players alike to be the epitome of sportsman spirit, humility and ethics in the game...he was there when a subway was named after him in Bangalore a few years back. Does it make him a man with mountain ego? By mistake, if a nut politician decides to honour you, would you refuse to attend the function??? You're becoming a joke Mr. Guha.

                            A fine and balanced article about the personality cult which is deeply embedded in our society. There can be no disagreement that it is the prime reason for lack/lesser questioning attitude amongst our intellectuals/academicians/scientists/experts in all fields. It is also true that when personality cult turns into reverence, holy cow attitude creeps in and that is a bane to original and creative thinking. Another fact which Ramchandra Guha subtly  touches upon is our cultural ethos of  getting too much in seniourity business. Seniours in all walks of life are expected to be stonewalled from intellectual challenges. Now respecting them is good but they are still mortals. Intellectual challenge is important to our holistic growth as a nation and we need to evolve to a no hold barred disagreement culture. A lot of this change is slowly and steadily creeping in. But I disagree with the author when he uses adjective of semi educated for a self made man from humble origins. Now I challenge you Ramchandra Guha to come out with the nuances of being educated. What you imply is that people become educated only when they go to premier institutions or chat and dine and talk in the company of elite academicians/experts. I am sorry I agree disagree. A lot of learning in life comes from life itself. And especially so for people who lead and govern. You require intelligence and not necessarily privileged education for that. History is testimony to the assertion. The latest being sheer incompetence of our most educated PM at leading the country just 9 months back. Overall I appreciate your analysis.

                            Why hold only Indian scholars to this high standard? Take one of the most famous scholarships in the world - Rhodes scholarship, named after its patron Cecil Rhodes. Not only the scholarship, this guy named a country after him - Rhodesia. There are other examples, too - but most historians play this game of convenient omissions to drive home a point, often tinged with a personal agenda.

                            Ramachandra Guha hsa always been an admirer of the Nehru/Gandhis; it must be difficult for him to accept the total devastation of the family with which he apparently has a quid pro quo. <br/>
How subtly he has tried to denigrate Mr Modi; he begins and ends the article with his sarcastic comments on Mr Modi's suit. This was the reason for this very pedestrian article, and Mr CNR Rao etc are just cover ups.It is quite obvious that mr Guha is no longer being given the importance e was used too. Sour grapes indeed. has ne forgotten the number of schemes all over India named after the Nehrus and gandhis; not even a word of this in this article which purports to highlight the 'Staggering vanities of Indians'. No Indian has been more vain than the Nehrus/Gandhis.

                            1. The way Modi presented himself was to connect better with a Western Leaders who typically dress well. Otherwise people blame him saying he dresses like a hermit.<br/><br/>
2. There is already a circle in Bangalore called Anil Kumble Circle. Mr Guha should know that. Nothing wrong if C N R Rao has a circle in his name. <br/><br/>
3. People from all walks of life are human beings. They are given to ego, pride and so on. We would rather have credible human beings than those who profess false ideals in public and do something else in private.

                            Very few ask tough questions to our scientists. It is often said that "he is a world famous scientist in India".  This is true of CNR Rao, Mashelkar and many such scientists who occupy high positions and status without actually making important contributions. The essence of Guha's article is right. We need youngsters in science to take over and a entirely different way of evaluating contributions.

                            I like Modi but not his recent policies, especially trying to win Delhi by compromising many of his belief. But still I believe wearing a suit with that name is ok. I would personally would like to do that in my wedding. Thats good trend setter and he is PM , he gets salary of 1 Lacs per month, its ok for him to spend that amount. He also must have some savings as a CM for 12 years.<br/>
We people always try to equate poor look, poor quality, behaviors like poor to the massiha of poor. Thats why Rahul gandhi do not shave and always try to show that he is poor. People need to believe that even after wearing nice cloths you can have good heart and intention to serve the people need.<br/><br/>

There are scientists who are holding their positions for over 40 years in Indian institutions. No one can budge them. There are senior faculty/ members whose ego dictates what their juniors do and not what the world needs or the juniors wish to pursue. We are 60 years behind an open dialog society as far as science is concerned. Forget IIT's and similar institutes, they are also in the same boat. Kudos!

                            Having said that, i have to admit that I could not really follow what Mr Guha was trying to say? If Mr Modi wears an expensive suit with his own money, why should that cause an itch on others? And as long as he does not plunder country´s exchequer? I would rather look into what Mr Modi has achieved in favour of India while hosting Obama with a fairy tale like reception. To me that is most important than whatever attire he was on! Why Mr Guha did take the name of Anil Kumble? I would not mind at all if a square or a road is named after him because of his huge contribution in Indian cricket! Moreover Anil Kumble is a very patriotic person and has a personality that is far above than others not only in Indian cricket but also in many other circles. Let there be "worship" on individuals like Anil Kumble: I won´t bother. We are talking about a country called India where Anil Kumbles are not in plenty.<br/>
I would be glad if Mr Guha could take a hand on Obama for his religious remarks. When there have been regular massacre of Christians in Pakistan or in Africa, he does not speak about religious intolerance. Obama knows Gandhi but he does not know the birth pangs of India: Compared with the neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh India really is an outstanding example of religious tolerance. Mr Guha please talk about this: this issue is of far greater importance that Modi´s attire!

                            With Mashelkar, one will find little by way of original scientific contributions of much merit. He has indeed published numerous papers, but none of any lasting significance. However, going back at least three decades, one would find a sequence of remarkably consistent self-promotions, given credence entirely by the positions he held and the recognitions and awards that came with those positions. If he talks only about himself, it is because he has little to show by way of scientific worth.

                            The authors arguments are shallow.  Modi wearing a suit with his name forming the pin stripes is not an example of the insidious vanity that allows someone to name an airport after their  family or an academic chair after themselves. Modi stays away from this insidious or nepotistic vanity.  His own mother lives in a low-income housing flat with his younger brother; he didn't allow people to celebrate his birthday or the Gujarat school system to include his biography in their curriculum.  Priyanka Gandhi, on the other hand, lives in New Delhi's spacious Lodhi Estate (without holding any office).  <br/><br/>
The journal Current Science is not quite like the American journal Science or the British Nature.  The latter two are journals which publish summary versions of important research that has been accepted for publication in their longer form in a major research journal.  Current Science is a journal that accepts popular articles as well as full-length articles.  Some of these are superficially peer-reviewed.  <br/><br/>
A cogent criticism of Modi changing his clothes several times a day is more that the new aspiring classes notice these things and this (harmless vanity) distances Modi from them if they are not seeing economic gains for themselves.  I believe naming a street after yourself or a academic chair after yourself is much more a form of self-aggrandizement than the personal vanity of dress that Narendra Modi has displayed thus far.  His form of vanity we all engage in to some extent when we dress up.

                            Very true. Scientists in India think they are above science. And the real servants of science in this country doesn't get recognized. <br/><br/>
Take the example of KN Raj, a person I consider as the best economist India ever seen. I never knew about him or read about him until his death years ago - courtesy to the low profile he kept . He was a modest man who could spot, nurture talent and build great institutions such as Delhi School of Economics and CDS. I can't find anyone else who has build a world class academic center in India. <br/><br/>
I hope Mr Guha uses Prof Raj while mentioning about great economists of India.

Yes, that is the word, its not about scientific or any other achievement, its about the solidity of one's character that one can denounce such foolish and lavish praise and self praise. But perhaps that mould in which such human beings were built has been lost by God. I too am lost,,, By God.. really..

Just like hero worshiping is bad, similarly demonising someone (esp. who is democratically elected) is equally bad if not worse, and Ram Guha should remember that when talking about Modi. Most importantly, please stop preaching others, and follow the rules of people whom you respect, unfortunately so many liberals in India are too much in love with themselves.

I generally refrain from commenting in these forums but I found myself unable to to do so after reading your column. <br/>
Let us take the case of Prof. Bhagwati. If someone (read the prestigious university like Columbia) wants, how is it his problem. For example Prof. Nils Hasselmo (University of Minnesota President) has a hall named after him. It is a way if honoring people who has achieved things. According to your own accord, Bhagwati has been one of the greatest Indian social scientist. So how is endowing a position a big thing. <br/>
What baffled me the most in this article is how you failed to mention people like Nehru and Mrs. Gandhi in this article. They displayed the most appropriate case of vanity when they awarded themselves the Bharat Ratna. <br/>
Please refrain from blaming the real scholars who made India proud and instead look at the people who self-aggrandized themselves and it'll surely help you prove your point.

                            What Modi and Mashelkar did are frownable since they initiated themselves what they did. But the case of CNR Rao, Amartya Sen and Bhagwati cannot be kept in the same category. Nevertheless excessive hero-worship is a matter of concern.

                            'But in a country where hero worship is so ubiquitous, where the vanity of the powerful and the famous is so staggeringly large,---When India's top scholars and scientists are so flagrantly narcissistic, one must not be too harsh on a self-made, semi-educated, political leader for being so.' Let me add --- when people don't object having CMs who either rule from prison or through their stooges, or  powerful cabinet minister who lose elections only to pick up two cabinet portfolios, or PMs who never fight elections or are denied simple visas in US for questionable conduct, we have a situation of यथा राजा तथा प्रजा (as the king, same the public) or the vice versa.

                            @Mitra You said "So you are saying scholars and scientists should be held to the same standards as Mayawati and Mulayam? "<br/><br/>
Aren't we comparing here Modi to Scientists here? Also, I am comparing with PM Nehru and Indira Gandhi. Do you think Scientists and Scholars are superior to PM?<br/><br/>
I don't know why there is so much fuss about PM Modi's name on his suit. You can't even see clearly what's written on his suit unless you do zoom in.

                            Although I would have voted for Modi in the last elections had I been in India, I find it rather disgusting and utterly distastefulfor someone to wear a suit with their own name embroidered. Did he think he was a Cricket player on the field?<br/><br/>
As for the examples of CNR Rao, Bhagwati and Sen, I don't see what's wrong in having circles or squares named after them. I would certainly agree with the criticism if they have encouraged a sycophantic culture in their spheres of influence, which Guha alleges they had in the case of CNR Rao at least. Naming Buildings, Roads, Circles after famous living people is done all around the world, especially in the US, where it is controversial in some cases.<br/><br/>
Humility is not an end goal in itself. No one would accuse Nehru of being humble and yet, he was a great man.
