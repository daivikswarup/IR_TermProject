Headline::::Modi's Attempt to Teach Kejriwal a Lesson



DateTime::::2015-12-16T20:24:00+05:30




                                I was a small kid when Emergency was imposed in the country. I have a very faint idea about it, but yesterday, I felt it from a very close quarter and realized what it was, and why the country in the mid-70s was so outraged and why it is still considered a black chapter in Indian history. Yesterday, a duly elected Chief Minister's office was raided and sealed and nobody was allowed to enter the third floor of the central secretariat where the Chief Minister of Delhi sits. When I was contacted by the media for my reaction, I could not believe that this had really happened. At least I had not imagined it was possible. I had to make a few phone calls to party colleagues and to members of the cabinet to confirm the news. Finally, I read Arvind Kejriwal's tweets.
In independent India, in an open democracy, the government's much-maligned investigative agency, the CBI, described about two years ago by the Supreme Court as a caged parrot, has been used to settle political scores and discredit an honest government. The pretext was to raid and investigate the Principal Secretary of the Chief Minister in a case of corruption. This officer had an impeccable record till a few months ago when a disgruntled officer complained against him for alleged wrongdoing in the allotment of a tender in his earlier posting in the VAT department. This complaint was given to the Anti-Corruption Bureau which itself was forcibly taken over by the central government and this complaint was "royally" forwarded to the CBI, which directly reports to the central government. This was the bureaucrat who was given the Prime Minister's excellence award in 2008 for his professionalism and integrity in discharging his duty as an officer.
Now, the CBI is saying this officer needs to be investigated and his office has to be probed. This is an alibi, a lame excuse - the target is Arvind Kejriwal's government; this is an attempt to intimidate him, his cabinet colleagues and his party. It is an attempt to teach him a lesson. Mr Modi has a record of politically targeting his opponents, browbeating those who dare challenge him. Modi's twelve years' rule in Gujarat are witness to this fact. There are a number of examples where old dead cases were dug out, frivolous cases were lodged and opponents were put behind bars. Unfortunately, Arvind Kejriwal and AAP crossed his path.
Remember Arvind Kejriwal had decided to visit Gujarat before the parliamentary elections to expose his model of development. During his visit, he was detained for a few hours on the pretext of traffic disruption. It was the same Arvind Kejriwal who decided to openly challenge Modi in Varanasi in electoral politics. It was the same Arvind Kejriwal whose party contested elections in Delhi and recorded the most stunning victory in Indian political history. This magical victory was the victory of hope. It came at a time when Mr Modi was thought to be invincible, he had just emerged victorious in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Haryana and also in Jammu and Kashmir. Nobody could think that he could be defeated, or that the margin of defeat could be so humiliating. The BJP, despite Mr Modi's popularity was reduced to only three seats. For Mr Modi, nothing could be more insulting than this. This was Mr Modi's first ever defeat since 2001.
Soon after the government was sworn in, the vendetta against the AAP and its government started. One after another, AAP MLAs were targeted, they were jailed on frivolous charges. It was not a coincidence that BJP veteran LK Advani said in an interview to Indian Express that forces of democracy have been weakened and an Emergency-like situation is emerging on the horizon. Advani was credited with having saved Mr Modi from being sacked by Atal Bihari Vajpayee after the Gujarat riots, but the same Advani refused to accept him as the Prime Ministerial candidate for the BJP. He did not attend the Goa conference where Modi was elected the chief of the campaign committee. Instead, he preferred to refer to Mussolini and Hitler in one of his blogs.
Yesterday's incident is a kind of a coup. In independent India, no other Chief Minister's office has been raided and sealed like this. Yes, I am not denying the fact that there have been incidents when the Principal Secretary of a Chief Minister has been raided and put behind bars. But never ever has the Chief Minister's office been targeted like this. There is no allegation of corruption against Arvind Kejriwal. In fact, he has set an example by sacking his own cabinet colleague in October after receiving a serious complaint with credible evidence against the minister. He did not wait for the news to appear in the media or for the matter to be raised by the opposition.
A few days ago, Arvind Kejriwal's office tipped off the CBI about the corruption of one of his senior IAS officers. The officer was caught red-handed accepting a bribe. In this case, it was expected from the investigating agency that as a courtesy, the CBI should have informed the Chief Minister's office about the raid as mandated by the CBI's internal circular. But it did not. May I ask why? The AAP government has repeatedly said that the party is the product of the anti-corruption-movement, it will not tolerate corruption and corrupt officers, and it will take strictest action against such people. I am dead sure if this case was also presented to the Chief Minister with "credible evidence", similar action would have followed.
Since the CBI had some ulterior motive, It did not bother to inform the Chief Minister, and instead of raiding the departments where the officer concerned had indulged in alleged wrong-doing in the past, it took forcible possession of the Chief Minister's office. There was no reason for the CBI to look into the files related to the Chief Minister's office. Ideally, if the CBI was so concerned about unearthing corruption, it would have raided the VAT department where the Principal Secretary had allegedly indulged in the so-called scam.
Mr Modi is no ordinary leader. He loves to listen to his own voice. But sometimes dictators tend to forget, like Mrs Indira Gandhi, that India is not a banana republic, it is a vibrant democracy where We the People are supreme. AAP knows that finally this battle will be fought in the court of the people which will ask why an attempt was made to destabilise a democratically-elected government. Mr Modi has to answer as this was no ordinary raid, it was a raid to kill the spirit of the constitution, to maul the federal structure of the democracy. It was an attempt to impose an undeclared Emergency in Delhi. It was only for such incidents that it was said "Those who don't learn from history are condemned to repeat it, first time as farce and second time as tragedy".
This tragedy will haunt Mr Modi.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            AAP is taking itself serously, Kejriwal is one among 30 CM's in the country. . Just because he's Delhi CM doesn't equate him to the post of PM and think everyone is after him.. NDTV is giving too much importance to Delhi CM.. its national tv channel or Regional channel

                            Heard Ashutosh on timesnow yesterday. It seems facts and logic is something AAP members fails to understand. The raids were on the CMO premises but not CM's office but his secretary. A CBI raid is supposed to be unannounced and it is the norm of raids to keep the area cordoned off. A total of 14 places were raided...if the target of the raid was Mr. Kejriwal his house and other properties would have been raided too. <br/>
Now coming to his second claim of DDCA files gone missing...wasn't he the same person who had 380 pages of evidence against Shiela Dixit which mysteriously went missing....is it one of those files. And most important official files are now stored in computers....if a hard copy goes missing it is not the end of the world. However, my question is what was such sensitive file doing in the principle secretaries office...and how was tainted IAS officer get appointed by a political party that claims to be the cleanest political part.

                            Why did you not act/investigate Rajendra Kumar when Transparency International, India mailed you about his alleged corruptions? Why did you not investigate him when Ashish Jain raised objections 7 months back? And mind you Ashutosh (as you are an idiot and totally ignorant of what the law says), as per the Supreme Court of India's order dated May, 2014,  CBI did not need to inform the CM. Kejriwal's words and actions show his double standards. Arvind Kejriwal is a vile, pathetic human being. End of story.

                            Modi Did not push Kejriwal.....It is Kejri whose Pushed himself....If Kejri's No1 Secretary is guilty of corruption instead of supporting this corrupt he should stand with CBI and cooperate....That's expected from him. On contrary he is saying that before raid he was not kept in loop ......is it the normal process? Its not end there he is saying PM is Psychopath....being an educated IITian it is thoroughly unacceptable and improper....probably he has learnt it from Lalu when he was supporting "Mahagathbandhan"

                            Ashustosh how can he be a dictator?<br/><br/>
Definition of Dictator (source wikipedia):<br/><br/>
A dictator is a ruler who wields absolute authority. A state ruled by a dictator is called a dictatorship. <br/><br/><br/>
In modern usage, the term "dictator" is generally used to describe a leader who holds and/or abuses an extraordinary amount of personal power, especially the power to make laws without effective restraint by a legislative assembly.<br/><br/>
 Dictatorships are often characterised by some of the following traits: suspension of elections and of civil liberties; proclamation of a state of emergency; rule by decree; repression of political opponents without abiding by rule of law procedures; these include single-party state, and cult of personality<br/><br/>
Unless my memory has gone for a toss, India held General Elections in 2014 and as a result of which Mr Modi was elected. So how is he a dictator??

I wish our PM focuses on real development &amp; corruption issues &amp; also sends hard message to his ministers not to indulge in this dirty games. <br/><br/>
As far as our CM is concerned it will only make his resolve stronger. and this signal's a steep slope of the BJP,s Popularity and only one term for our PM.<br/><br/>

                            This moron should know that pm has nothing to do with the raids. I tell why. A complaint come to cbi about this high officer corruption and  CBI investigate and prima facie finds marit and wanted to raid 14 places, presented it's case to a court and got search warrants and then raided 14 premises they thought they cn find evidence from. where does the pm comes in all this. Do they think PM is so free to think and plot such things aginst a novice politician like kejriwal and what will he gain from it. Do you think he is so foolish to waste so much time and energies on such a waste. Delhi elections are nowhere and modi had to loose everything and gain nothing from targeting kejriwal but still he didn't interfere with the process of CBI investigation.

So Modi is the superman (or god) who control every body in the government. And Mr Kejriwal is so important that Modi would devote his time, effort and energy to target Kejriwal.<br/>
I have seen Kejriwal and his people only crying and doing nothing. They have no vision, no maturity and no honesty.

                            Ashutosh, you are a kid now also :-) you couldn't justify MLA salary hike...please read the readers comments to that blog.<br/><br/>
We have seen lot of AAP spit and run. What happened to Shiela Dixit charge sheet ? Please reveal that also :-) Already nine months are over and is perfect time for the delivery :-)<br/><br/>
In the way AK acted in front of the camera yesterday and called names to PM was disgusting to say the least. It appeared as if he had lost his mental balance at that time. His body language and stress on his face were revealing. I am still wondering what is this man up to ?? Has he got anything to hide ??<br/><br/>
Also the charge that CBI has taken file movement register of recent times, doesn't hold any sway. That is for two reasons :<br/><br/>
1. Old files can still move around in government offices and CBI has right to know this.<br/>
2. It appears Rajendra Kumar was still holding additional charge of Secretary Services and was in charge of contracts still - so that also can be the reason to look at these records. <br/><br/>
Against DDCA - Jaitley clearly said, if there is any specific allegation, he will answer it. Also the file was apparently lying on AK's table for last one month. Also this has been prepared on request of central government itself. Also Delhi Government doesn't have the rights to order commission of enquiry ??<br/><br/>
Even many AAP volunteers are repenting having supported AAP and also majority MLAs have vanished to behind the scene now. They don't want to defend their leader ??<br/><br/>
AK is loosing support in Delhi. In a recent survey his lead over Shiela Dixit was merely 4 points. 32 to 28. After this incidence, it would be behind Shiela Dixit. I hope some credible agency conducts survey and shows it to AAP.<br/><br/>

                            See the difference between the writings of Shashi Tharoor on one hand and Nanhaa Munna Ashutosh (NMA)and Money Sucker Aiyer (MSA) on the other hand? All of them are in the opposition, all of them criticise the NDA-Government. The difference? Dr. Tharoor's criticism is balanced, his language sophisticated, and his arguments - often compulsive. You may not agree with his world-view, but it makes you think. It gives you - the other perspective. The posts of NMA and MSA? Well less said about is better.<br/>
Dear NDTV: And yet, please continue to publish posts of these two jokers. I visit NDTV only to read the Comments when the jokers write.<br/>
PS: Another observation. Tharoor writes when he writes. That is, when he finds an issue worthy of writing about. These two jokers write on a weekly basis. They have to "create" issues.

                            There is an old saying "where there is smoke there is fire". Here the way AAP is reacting to CBI's raid to the principal secretary's office raid seems very suspicious. Why are they reacting as if they have something to hide, what r they trying to hide? If there is nothing to hide way are they reacting in such a manner? In the process of investigation CBI conducts raids and there is nothing new to it, if this raid is a politically motivated one, then what is its basis, if u have done no wrong there is nothing u need to worry about. Let more raids be conducted, u have nothing to fear, or r u hiding something?

                            Transparency International had flagged this official, Yogendra Yadav and other on the then National Executive of AAP had also protested on Rajinder Kumar appointment. What a serial liar are AAP guys. Despite CBI categorically rejecting claims of raiding CM office, they are milking this false propaganda for political mileage. Remember, Kejriwal himself said, there will be no use of raid if they are informed beforehand. Ridiculous now to question surprise raids. Using abuses at PM is the lowest that they could have gone.

                            Delhi CM is the only CM without any portfolio. So he earns CM salary with no responsibility. hence he keeps coming up with issues against BJP. They accussed Sheila Dixit and then let her go scot free. Now they are accusing Jaitley witout any proof. With the logic that Cong and AAP are demanding resignations, their leaders shoudl also resingn from the leadership positions and committees. i.e. Sonia and Rahul should resign from CWC and KejriwL from being head of AAP.

AAP thinks that people of this country are fools. AAP has indeed fooled the Delhi electorate for 49 days and the people of Delhi did a mistake by giving a 2nd chance.

Leave the things about raid first of all Arvind ji should learn social manners. And u you know during the Anna andolan it was seconds team who had settled a petition for allowing cbi to conduct raid without any approval of the ministry. Now when this same free cbi is having raids on his own dept. Why is kejriwal panicking. Now he's getting Modi into it and making this political. Now where is the motto of cbi being independent.

                            Why would the CBI inform Kejriwal when he himself appointed Rajendra Kumar overlooking all the complaints against him....very childish argument indeed from AAP....anyways not expecting anything better from them.

                            Ashutosh looked like a fool during the debate with Arnab. Wonder if he himself saw the show. He is not even worth anyone's pity.

                            Why can a CM's office be raided ! Are they above law? Even PMOs office can be raided. Let court decide whether the accused is to be puished!

NAMO is  elected  PM of 125 crores . so whatever  you are telling to NAMo that is  applicable to  125cr  people of  India  . Namo always says by heart  confess that  PM  is equal to  125cr  Indian

                            Hi Ashtosh, If there is nothing to hide than why this outcry be open for any investigation by any agency,  if you and your party believe in Indian constitution and Judicial system than let this probe go through truth will prevail. But AAP reaction sending message that you people have something to hide!!!!!!!!!!
