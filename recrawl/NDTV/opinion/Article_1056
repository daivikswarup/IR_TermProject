Headline::::Meeting Kanhaiya Kumar, Who Made Azaadi An Anthem - By Barkha Dutt



DateTime::::2016-03-04T13:22:00+05:30



This is an opinion piece by the only journalist who met Kanhaiya Kumar after his release from jail last night.
The first thing I noticed was his smile - a boyish, toothy grin that travelled all the way up to his eyes that still glimmered with hope and optimism, despite having spent the last 23 days in prison.
 

The media was being kept at a firm distance from JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar as political leaders of the CPI escorted him under-the-radar from Delhi's Tihar Jail to Jawaharlal Nehru University and quietly bundled him into a faculty member's residence. Even as a journalist, I didn't blame them for their wariness about allowing Kanhaiya, 28, to engage with the press. Given the shameful conduct of three prominent channels, their hyperventilating anchors and worst, the broadcast of a doctored video and morphed photograph to build a ham-handed case of sedition against him, I, too, would have been suspicious.
On the leafy campus grounds of the 46-year-old institution was an air of anticipation and excitement as news spread Kanhaiya, their student union's President, was back. But no one knew where he was or when he would emerge to address them.
As I downed my nth cup of nimbu chai (lemon tea) and thought of the inevitable media scrum that would follow, I was beginning to wonder if I would be able to meet Kanhaiya at all. Then a source tipped us off that the student leader, whose arrest on charges of sedition catapulted him to global headlines and instant stardom, may be at the residence of Professor Ajay Patnaik, a faculty member who stood steadfast in his support for him. And so, we found ourselves standing unannounced at the door of his house, a door that was initially shut firmly in our faces when they saw our cameras.
Later, on the condition that we leave the equipment outside, we were let into a tastefully-drawn living room where the man, described by detractors as "no less dangerous than Masood Azhar", was standing in the centre, flanked by friends taking selfies! Just in that moment, Kanhaiya was neither revolutionary nor rebel nor leader; he was just a regular young guy, hanging out with his friends, mentally blocking out the terrible ordeal he had been through. The sheer normalcy of that image brought home the absurdity - and the cruelty - of all those who have, in the last few weeks, presented Kanhaiya, the son of an Anganwadi worker from Bihar, as a national security threat.
 
Kanhaiya Kumar is all smiles as he poses for the cameras along with his friends
One of the teachers took me aside and explained that they asked me to leave my camera outside as "the boy is still very traumatised." I could believe that; first to be accused of treason, then to have your call for azaadi from inequality, discrimination and poverty to be doctored into sounding like a slogan of secession and, finally, to be thrashed so brutally in the court by goons in black robes that your stomach is pulverised and your trousers come off. Who could possibly be calm after all that?
Yet, when I started talking to Kanhaiya, he spoke with absolute clarity and resolve. "I had a lot of time to think in jail," he told me. "I used to watch every bit of news about me on TV, I read all the editorials. And then I thought, everyone has said something about me; everyone thinks they know me, so many people have judged me. Now, I will write my own story... Ab main bhi likhoonga apni kahaani." His thoughts were somber, grave, even profound, but through it all, his eyes twinkled with a mix of youthful idealism and contagious naughtiness.
 
Kanhaiya Kumar and NDTV's Barkha Dutt in conversation after his release from jail
You must be anxious and scared I suggested. "Not at all," he laughed, saying, "dheere dheere sab saaf ho raha hai (everything is slowly becoming clear). I never raised any slogans against India. Facts are emerging slowly."
More than the violence unleashed on him by lumpen lawyers, what really seemed to bother him were the fake videos and morphed pictures about him. We spoke of how his case had polarised not just politics but India's television media like never before. He made a few jokes about prime time anchors who use patriotism as a shield for blusterous slander. "You weren't all like that, I watched and read everything in jail," Kanhaiya said. "The truth will prevail. I know this is a long battle and I am ready for it," he said, before being whisked away by his minders out of the back door.
 
"Ab main bhi likhoonga apni kahaani (Now, I will write my own story)," Kanhaiya Kumar told NDTV's Barkha Dutt
The ghar wapasi (homecoming) of Kanhaiya has delivered some home truths to the Narendra Modi government. Their clumsy overreach and mindless muscle-flexing on an issue that was best left for university authorities to tackle has given birth to a new political star. This was evident in Kanhaiya's mesmerising 60-minute speech later that evening. Till then, channels had been occupied with debating who had won the speech wars in Parliament - Prime Minister Modi or Rahul Gandhi. Now, the answer was clear; even if you disagreed with every word he said in his speech and irrespective of whom you voted for, its mix of defiance, idealism, hope and humour gave top billing to Kanhaiya.
His detractors say that the political consequence of the speech, trending globally, will be zilch; outside the gates of JNU, they claim, no one cares. But the point is not whether slogans of 'Laal Salaam' still have resonance or whether Che Guevara has any appeal to today's young and restless. You don't have to be a supporter of the Left or its economic policies to recognise that Kanhaiya's passionate address - made incidentally under the protective flutter of the Indian tricolour - captured a sentiment that was in fact post-ideology. Whether Neo-liberal or Marxist, Right or Left is beside the point; what it represented was the assertion of freedom - yes 'azaadi'- from unpalatable McCarthyism and political highhandedness.
 
'Freedom in India,' said JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar as hundreds cheered (Press Trust of India photo)
Yes, the Delhi government's fact-finding report - which has given Kanhaiya a clean chit - has called for further investigation against some of the other JNU students. It has also concluded that "anti-national slogans were raised", and "many students from outside, especially some Kashmiri students had joined the group." These are questions that will eventually be decided in court. But for now, the moment belongs to the student union leader.
At midnight, as I headed back, the campus was still bustling; the cool night breeze unable to make much difference to the heated arguments that would carry on well into the night. I thought of the ultimate irony - the man who had mainstreamed the 'Azaadi' slogan and almost created a new generation's anthem (down to rap mixes and folk tunes) was anything but free. The Delhi High Court judge who gave Kanhaiya bail used truly peculiar metaphors of infected limbs, antibiotics, surgery and gangrene to describe Kanhaiya's case - a reminder that the bail, at this stage, was strictly temporary. I wondered if Justice Prabha Rani would consider words as harsh for Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa who had demanded the release of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's killers on the same day that Kanhaiya's 'anti-nationalism' was being debated. I wondered too if she might have felt differently had she seen hundreds of JNU students echoing Kanhaiya's call for 'Azaadi' (not from India, but in India), their fists punching the air in solidarity. Since she had mentioned Bhagat Singh, the young revolutionary, in her bail order, I thought of whether she had seen one of his most definitive statements made during the course of his own trial: "Bombs and pistols do not make revolution. That is not our understanding. The sword of revolution is sharpened on the whetting-stone of ideas."(Barkha Dutt is an award-winning journalist and Consulting Editor with NDTV.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Kanhaiyya definitely saw spark in him. Though his speech was brilliant it was heavily one sided like we see speeches from Kerala comrades with no mention of Islamic terrorism. But we do see one opportunist talentless columnist / anchor who is flocking to be at side where see she greener pasture.

                            Ok, Stalinisto! Commie influenced states in India produce the least of farm produce and industrial produce in the country and are in no shape to sustain themselves. Commies are most delusional and probably only Chinese manufactured political outfit in India. Remember this was the same place that kept echoing `Chairman of China is our Chairman'. They have no history of loyalty to the country but more to Russia &amp; China and have become such a drag on the country. What these bunch of losers don't realise is they gifted the US's MFN to China in making China the second biggest economy in the world. These commies can keep twitching their Marx &amp; Mao bluff, but India or Bharat is not going to give them two cents.

                            Indeed, "Patriotism is the last refuge of Scoundrels". &amp; This is how it is applied perfectly in this case::: At first party and/or chant anti-India hate slogans with "India haters" . Then when you sense trouble from police and law authorities you start chanting "Azadi from ...Garibi...etc" nonsense. When hypocrites and liars like you express their love for country, its then that patriotism becomes the last refuge for scoundrels to save their back and for all those people who have always ardently supported "human-rights" of slained and dreaded terrorists who killed hundreds of innocent Indians.

                            Madam inequality, caste system, poverty etc do not exist in JNU or New Delhi. It is in its ugliest form in his own state Bihar. Shouting slogans in Delhi is not the solution for the ills he is talking about. If he has the guts, ask him, first to go to his own home state and do the miracles and change the scenario there. Preaching ideology on the comforts of subsidized life is much easier.

                            The Bail conditions imposed by the Delhi High Court is really strange: particularly on those two persons who come forward to stand as surety for his release. If we examine the purposes of the surety, they are required to ensure that if the accused does not report back or do whatever he is required to physically do during the bail period like visiting the police stations periodically, or going some where for examining him etc and finally if sentenced to meet the court terms.What ever be the conditions, they should be realistically achievable and should not be impractical. I do not understand how such a person CAN ENSURE THAT KANHAIYA KUMAR's THINKING AND HIS THOUGHT FLOW WILL BE AS PER CERTAIN STANDARDS THAT THE COURT WANTS. HOW DOES THE COURT EXPECT A PERSON WHO IS THE SURETY TO EXCERISE SUCH A CONTROL ON KANAIYA KUMAR THAT HE WILL NOT EVER THINK IN HIS MIND IN A CONTRARY MANNER.  Perhaps this is a good way to cancel his bail  and put him back in prison.

                            Ha Ha Ha. NDTV or ABP has to be first to go to Interview this Brain Washed Student From Bihar. Sahi kaha hai kisi ne UP Bihar ke Bacche Bacche ke bold me Raaj neeti hai. Kanhaiya can only be beaten in a debate by people like us who are from UP and Bihar, we can go on giving Long Speeches till the end of the Dawn. Even we were student just some years back and I knew only one thin, If I hade to bring my family out of Poverty, I will have to work hard mmyself and succeed. I was not relying on any Reservation or Quota. I succeeded. and if each Student himself thinks that he can bring himself and his family out of Poverty he will succeed. No Government can bring you out of poverty. Its a myth. If that was the case West Bengal would had the highest GDP among states, but It is Still Sick and paralysed and please someone tell Kanhaiya that West Bengal was ruled for 40 Years by his so called Mentors CPI-CPM. Students like Kanhaiya will never work for a multinational, as he will one day be a leader and earn much more that that. He is quite aware of that. This is India. Jai Hind. Jai Bharat.

                            In UP-Bihar there is a tradition, that most of the failed student too keep trying to appear for IAS and IPS Exams by going in another city and informing their parents that they are preparing for competition. In name of Competition, they keep asking their Farmer Parents Money which they spend on Cigarettes, Beer and so called Raajneeti. Kanhaiya Kumar is an excellent example of such a student. Being from a poor family, he should have joined any company and started supporting his father and Mother. But instead till age of 29-30, he is doing research, that too on African Countries and not trying to get his parents and family out of Poverty. he wants Prime Minister to Get him out of this Poverty. Useless Media Channels and Political parties are supporting him, just for the sake of Publicity. In my family most of the students started to work by 22 years of age, as we too belong to a poor family and needed support. Now all of them are on their feet and supporting India in its growth. This is the only way out. No Political party will take you out of poverty. JAAGO BHARAT JAAGO.

                            Here is my response to the "Great Speech".<br/>
1. For starters, I am thankful to the entire controversy since for the first time, you (Kanhaya Kumar) and your "Jhola Chap" College friends would have lifted the Tri colour.<br/>
2. "Azadi" from discrimination, hunger etc. "Within India" is welcomed, but for that, you need not to be leading people shouting India Ki Barbadi. <br/>
3. Your folks may be farmers but Afzal Guru was not. Nor he was ploughing any "field" during the Parliament attack. Thus eulogizing him, wouldn't stem the farmer suicides.<br/>
4. Attack RSS for sure, but who will attack Muslim League, SIMI, ISIS, LeT, JeM, MCC and other Naxalite Groups? How about NSCN? Your attack on RSS is "Progressive" but do you think "RSS" is killing our soldiers in J&amp;K or our para military forces in North East or our CRPF men in Chhattisgarh? <br/>
5. You seem perturbed by Hyderabad University and "discrimination". Why don't you start by asking your "JNU batch mates" to drop their surnames and starting a crusade in your own "state" where ALL Political Parties unashamedly indulge in Caste based politics. How about discrimination within your own party? How many Dalits are part of CPI/ CPM's Polite Bureau? <br/>
6. How do you think "Freedom" from hunger will come? Will it come by Industrialization or increasing minimum support prices of crops? Do we need to make India a world Economic power house or a "closed economy"? <br/>
7. Coming to the "core issue". Can you share with us, what were court's observations? Did court say that Police was wrong? or your "cultural event" was justified? <br/>
8. You "claimed" that those who shouted slogans were not your friends. If you are the President and its your university, you want us to believe that 10 "outsiders" can come from outside and do whatever they want in your campus amidst hundreds of you?<br/>
9. How about Umar Khalid? His video was not doctored? Would you acknowledge that him and couple of your friends also shouted slogans? Why not come "clean" since you are speaking from the heart?<br/>
10. Lastly, How many such "cultural events" happened in the past? Would you share details of "participants and what all transpired"?

                            Kanhaiya Kumar is talking too much. He claims that his 'azadi' was actually azadi from daily problems in India. Was he talking to JNU students and 400 outsiders about this azadi on 'Afzal Guru Martyrdom Day'? Outright liar. And what is more pathetic is some are hailing his speech as if a new Mahatma Gandhi has come.

                            azaadi from poverty is possible by creating job opportunities,  not from his speech. No doubt there must be freedom of thought and speech,  but India's need of hour is uplifting the poor by job creation without exploitation

                            NDTV Coverage on Kumar is obvious, as anything against Government is welcome to NDTV even if it is from alleged Anti National.  It is  surprising that poverty landed in India only in the last 21 months and not during 60 odd rule of left supported congress to which Kumar belongs.  See the living conditions of his parents in Bihar where his CPI supported party is in power for over 15 years. Whom you are fooling.People are clever to understand NDTV's one sided stories.

Some section of Media are trying to make a hero out of him not exactly in support of him but more so to take a different stand than their competitor channel. This filthy competition could prove dangerous at times. Last 1 week or so, the revelations about Ishrat jehan was tumbling one after the other but some of  the so called sickular channels chose not to cover it. Their only agenda is to target Modi.

                            What kind of AZADI Kanahya wants..? At the age of 28 he is still enjoying AZADI of free studies with the people's money. Still enjoying a comfortable free stay. He has azadi of organizing a function for a terrorist who was hanged as per the Indian law despite the fact that he lied to the JNU authorities by saying that it is just a cultural event. Authorities strictly refused to organize any event. Despite that he had the full AZADI to organize and celebrated the death anniversary of Afzal Guru. Got a bail on many conditions..but never mind he has azadi to speak against Prime Minister of India (Irrespective of which religion, caste and the party PM belongs to) That's the respect he gave...by saying " I want to catch your suit and ask ..what about Hitlor"? If this kind of Azadi is not enough then please tell me which part of the world has more azadi than this...? NDTV..Mrs Barkha...Kudos...you have made him a hero out of nothing....That's AAZADI..."IT HAPPENS ONLY IN INDIA".....!!!

i want azaadi from seeing this fellow anywhere in this country.

                            One thing is for sure, Modi's entry into national politics in 2013 has made politics very interesting for people who love him and also for people who don't. Earlier we used to skip the political articles of newspapers. Modi's rise has made the Communist's and Congress's to battle aggressive and hard. Communists basic philosophy of people's welfare is good. Contrary to Communists elsewhere,Communists in India are sacrificing their irreligious character and absorbing Islamic radicals into their fold. This may indicate to funding allegiance. I hope that these Communists not only fight for freedom of expression but also freedom of Muslim women from Polygamy, Cocubinage, Tripple talaq and Burka system. I hope they start fighting for independence of Baluchistan, Tibet, Xinjiang. I also hope they will start fighting for Dalit Hindus of Pakistan who have been persecuted since 1947. I also I will request them not to use picture of Dr Ambedkar as he had criticized anti-constitution views of Communist Party of India

                            When the case is under court jurisdiction, government agencies are involved then what rights Arvind Kejriwal of Delhi govt (a semi state) has to order magistrate inquiry and doing drama of video-audio tapes checking in private firm of his choice. Is he not trying to mislead and insulting to the courts that he can pass the judgments over and above our courts against whom these hooligans, leftist are raising hue and cry and demeaning them that their judgments was on  wrong afzal and yakkobs and every other terrorist. Kanhaiya and groups were first shouting Azzadi from India and breaking of India. Now it is just azaadi in India not from India. One more thing, these left based media channels famous dialogue was Nationality is the last refuge of scoundrels. So, did the mean Gandhi, Nehru or whom. Or did they mean the real patriots Subash, Azad, Bhagat Singh. I did not understand. These leftist were anti independence during those days. You can find about them on the internet most reputed sites. Congress party formed by british for britishers or these communist secretly formed by the foreigners to divert attention to some bogus things who is more scoundrel. And this whole drama by these leftist and congress party at this time is nothing but vote bank politics of appeasement. What is azadi for Kanhaiya, present govt has been elected by the peoples of India as per constitution so do they want azadi from constitution of the same Ambedkar they falsely adhore. JNU teachers are in full support of these so obviously some students will feel the heat and getting out from ABVP fold and getting in their folds.

                            Another ineffective leftist politician rises... instead of engaging with the govt, you abuse BJP, ABVP, RSS without any shred of logic. This shows the 'research' capabilities of this 'PhD' scholar.

                            The JNU issue is hypocrized by media ...it's not something that should grab as much unwanted attention as it's getting.<br/>
Fine, whether sedition or not, or tampered proof or not all these things, there is law system in place, and the truth will prevail!!<br/>
But at the first place there was no reason for the JNU students to create such an situation!!<br/>
If you ask any of them what was their thought process to say Afazal Guru was a hero n nobody is able to justify that!!!<br/>
Do they hell from Afazal Guru's birth place? N have studied whole of his life or witnessed all the court hearings?

                            Its laughable that certain section of media is trying to portray this convict as another Kejriwal.Registrar of JNU has confirmed that Kahnaiya was not only new about the Martyrdom day of Afzal Guru program but had protested on cancelling by the JNU authorities.He was not only present in the program but as a leader of AISF did not stop other students to shout anti India slogans.This guy is a Naxalite and has Maoist ideology deep rooted and found only place in bihar called begusarai, from where he hails.Giving conditional interim bail Court's observations are very strong and clear.To save his skin Kahnaiya has taken 180 degree turn now swearing by the Constitution. Kejriwal brand was created as he was heading Anti Corruption movement. Kahnaiya's ideology has No takers in real modern progressive India, more so as he is heading anti India &amp; maoist ideology with sedition charges slapped on his head.So media particularly NDTV should come of Fool's paradise and face the reality of real India &amp; sentiments of its citizens.

                            if you could have also written in detail on what the HC judge wrote in her judgement when giving an interim bail to this lad. As a journalist one should not be hyperbolic to a sentiment. A judge is like a match offical he may have his favorites but his decisions should never be biased by favoritism. While going all out on the case in a hurry is wrong going soft on these type of people is also wrong. The judge clearly said that these kind of activities are starting symptoms of a disease that can eventually result into an epidemic. <br/>
One should not be made a hero for saying bad about the country, the very same kanhiya kumar who feared for his life is now challenging the PM of this country while the truth is he was arrested as per the law and released as per the law so where does the PM (legislature) come into place when it is all about the judiciary.

                            Please promote him so that he can run against Mamata in WB. BTW JDU may also be looking at such promising talent. They might also induct him. No Garibi forever.
