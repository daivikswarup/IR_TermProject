Headline::::What India Should Learn From Paris Attacks



DateTime::::2015-11-24T03:56:00+05:30




                                Except for the utterly perverted, everyone would condemn the IS as barbaric and the terrorist attack in Paris as dastardly. I certainly do. But should our reflections on Paris be restricted to TV anchors hysterically condemning terrorism one day only to move on next day to lip-smacking stuff about the Mukherjeas? Or should one pause to reflect on why terrorism has come to occupy such an overwhelming presence in today's global discourse?
To ask the question is not to "justify" terrorism. If terrorism is to be conquered, it has to be understood. Merely condemning terrorism is not in itself an answer. Who are these terrorists? Why have they become terrorists? How has the weapon of terrorism become so effective? What are the reasons behind the upsurge of terrorism? All these are not only legitimate questions to ask but also necessary to comprehend the phenomenon and thereby move towards removing the menace root and branch. To imagine that terrorism will end by more intensively bombing the IS headquarters in Raqqa is to hopelessly underestimate the magnitude and complexity of the issues involved.
 
Why, in the first place, is France in the vanguard of matters Syrian? Surely it is not irrelevant that in the carving up of the Arab territories of the Turkish Empire following the fall of the Ottomans at the end of the First World War, France succeeded in securing Syria as its mandated territory. Ever since, and even following the post-WWII termination of the League of Nations mandate, France has regarded itself as having a special responsibility for matters Syrian - whether the Syrians wish it or not. Since Iraq was mandated to Britain, and not to France, perhaps this explains why France kept out of the Iraq invasion while Blair's Britain leaped into the fray. Contrariwise, it was France that forced itself into the vanguard on simultaneously promoting regime change in Syria while-air bombing the IS.
 
It is the confusion caused by pursuing these twin objectives simultaneously that has resulted in both Bashar al-Assad remaining in power and the IS expanding its vicious presence. With France declaring war against the IS in Syria, it has, of course, opened itself to IS retaliation in France. Causes have consequences, and consequences have causes. To take account of this cycle of causes and consequences is not to condone murderous terrorist attacks on innocent civilians but to suggest that the killing of civilian non-combatants in aerial strikes from 30,000 feet above the ground does run the risk of the militarily weaker opponent (in this case, the IS) killing civilian non-combatants on the ground in attacks of terror.
 
I am neither sympathetic to, nor empathetic with, those who caused the mayhem in Paris on the night of 13 November. I am only attempting to understand what happened and why it happened. There are those who shrug off the deaths of thousands in intensive air-bombing as "collateral damage" when those killed are nameless innocents in less-known lands, but are enraged when hundreds are killed in more well-known cities like New York and Paris. I prefer to search for reality than limiting myself to loud lamentation.
 
This was the approach adopted by The Hindu in its Sunday special editorial the day after the Paris attack. Normally, there is no editorial page in the newspaper on Sundays, but on Sunday, 15 November their editorial team made an exception and produced a most thoughtful piece that I recommend in full to all readers of this column. The key points were:
 
France "started bombing IS targets in Syria""Paris was in the forefront of the countries that backed different rebel groups in Syria against the government of Bashar al-Assad""France has been hosting a group of Syrian opposition leaders since the outbreak of the civil war in that country""France should seriously ask itself why radical groups are finding recruits from its soil""The collapse of French multiculturalism and an increasingly narrow interpretation of secularism in France have only added to the radicalization of youth in that country"
And arising out of this listing of fundamental causes (which is not exhaustive as it does not touch upon the Sunni-Shia divide that was opened up by the overthrow of the secular Saddam regime, and is being aggravated by Sunni and Shia governments in West Asia backing different factions of the rebels and terrorists), the editorial draws the following conclusions regarding the steps to be taken to end the jihadist take-over and establish a durable order:
 
France (and the West more generally) "should rework its foreign policy towards West Asia that has largely been counter-productive""Broaden the state concepts of secularism  to rebuild the national consciousness that would bring all sections of French society into the national mainstream"Not "cave in to the rightist anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim groups" and "tighten the loose ends of its security and intelligence networks"
Admirably succinct - and doable. And what would be the purpose of acting so practically and pragmatically? To respond to the "alarm bells ringing in world capitals" owing to "the rapid rise of this group (IS) which is more of a death cult than a terrorist organization".
 
And while pointing to these fault lines in policy and their possible remedies, the editorial is unsparing in underlining that "the jihadist groups that kill ordinary citizens often blame the victims' governments to justify the ghastly acts they commit. But in reality they drive a project that is rooted in extreme violence and hatred". The editorial then adds: "But that doesn't mean the French government should be spared from criticism".
 
This approach was implicitly endorsed when G-20 met in Antalya, Turkey, in the immediate aftermath of the Paris attack. They concentrated their minds wonderfully on fighting for a common objective - finishing off the IS - without getting distracted, as France and its allies had been doing, by other objectives like regime change. The credit must primarily go to President Vladimir Putin who had earlier ordered Russian air strikes without seeking regime change. Antalya took matters a giant step forward when it was decided to coordinate action through the UN so as to bring the war against the IS within the bounds of legitimacy under international law.
 
The trouble with popular, high-pitched TV denunciation is that while it is long on grandstanding against terror, it is short on giving time and space for a serious consideration of the complex issues involved (the striking exception being NDTV). Jingoism could yet lead to Indian jawans getting caught up with boots on the ground in the latest war of terrorism. It was a disaster that was averted at the last minute during the Bush-Blair invasion of Iraq. Our principal concern should be to work for peace and the restoration of stability in West Asia, in cooperation with the international community, as we were famed to do in the Nehru era in Korea, Indo-China and Suez. Now we are drifting towards the "final burial of Nonalignment" as the foreign policy expert Prof. C. Rajamohan has admiringly proclaimed. That is why it bears emphasizing that while we may police the peace, we must not let ourselves get caught in the coils of war.(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mr. Ayyar. Most of your readers acknowledge your senility and discount most of what you say. However, since NDTV lends your opinions inordinate amount of importance, it is important to debunk the myths that you propagate because lie if spoken continuously becomes the truth in today's world. France had nothing to do with ISIS creation. There was an uprising in Syria against Bashar Al Assad's despotic regimen and the sunnis in the country felt discrimated against a ruler who is an Alawite (Shia sect). Bashar's forces used ruthless and disproportionate measures to quell the uprising and ISIS (pro sunni) group swooped in to take lead of the anti Bashar forces. France had never interfered in Syria's internal issues when Syria was a livable and peaceful place. France intervened when ISIS's atrocities (sex slaves, beheading, destruction of archaeological artifacts) became too outrageous to ignore for a responsible power who had influence over Syria at one point.<br/><br/>
Moreover, trying to analyze the root cause of young men from relatively wealthy neighborhoods of Europe partaking in the ghoulish practices of ISIS (like raping 7 year old Yazidi girls repeatedly) and then attributing this behavior somehow to French is beyond reprehensible.

Since Mr. Modi had started campaigning in 2014, all have you made against him &amp; his Governance, is cheap &amp; lewd comments, which is not surprising at all coming from a low-thinking level &amp; envious person like you.<br/>
Modi doesn't wear Bangles like you &amp; wait until someone at the LOC is killed &amp; neither does he bend down to Pakistan like you &amp; your Party did.<br/>
You deserve to go to Hafiz Saeed or PoK to preach peace; they will cut you in pieces (slowly &amp; painfully), so you understand how much they hate your India.  Either retire from you Career or do some Yoga, so you can bring some Sanity to your Senseless Brain (if you had any).

                            MSA -being politically correct is the cost Europe is paying today. You are living in 1960s era of Non Alignment when world around you have changed so much. You talk about French changing their concept of secularism when most of the Muslims live on welfare &amp; in Ghettos in Europe. They make no effort to either assimilate or to accept fresh way of life.  Don't you think it's time to start talking of things the way they are instead of being politically correct.

                            Mr Aiyar doesn't completely know the issue with Paris attacks. The perpetrators were originated from France's neighboring country Belgium, with its capital Brussels being the center of Jihadi terrorism in Europe. This small country called Belgium has nothing to do with Syria. Lot of muslim youth in this country are brainwashed by wahabism/salafism. They want to make it Belgistan and impose Sharia.<br/><br/>
This time they attacked Paris, next time god know where to establish the so called Caliphate.  I don't completely understand when Mr Aiyar links with France's Syrian colonial link.<br/><br/>
Lets assume as such. What about the bombed Russian plane? <br/><br/>
Without hesitation, the world should declare ISIS as enemy of humanity and start its destruction.

                            France wants to run with the Hares and hunt with the Hounds,u cannot do it both ways.The seeds of terrorism r clearly sown by those who want to dominate,but fail to understand that the seeds that they sow grow into monsters and usually r beyond their control.Brindranwale is an example of what Indira did to control the Akalis,but created a monster,which she could never control,then she had to use brutal force to eliminate him,which created the Khalistani movement and related terrorism.Mani's article is sensible and balanced.

It were youth who were from the middle class citizenry of France a country with the freedom to express ones grievances in whatever manner possible, even open criticism of govt. But they chose to gun down innocent people only reinforcing the rhetoric of religious indoctrination and achieving ones goals by violent means. Remember Vietnam and Japan, but none of these people nor their citizens abroad had blown himself or mass murdered in retaliation. Then why this particular religious group only? Not Haitian, African, where the worst kind of atrocities happening.

We as Indians should stand up United and not blame leaders like Mr. Ajiyar for giving such practical solutions . <br/>
Here I would like NDTV to exercise more diligence and provide its readers with knowledge which is TRUE and not news of Mukherjees and Peters.

                            This commie is a traitor who raised funds for Chinese soldiers. If that is not treason than what is? His jealousy  stems from the fact that he had free run over the country and now that is gone. The fool relates the Ottoman Empire to the current actions of ISIS, and talks about "action and reaction" does he use that same logic in Gujarat? Or his own loss of power? <br/>
These seculars, leftists, communists are piggy backing on the Islamists and are modern jai chands that need to be weeded out. Or else you will meet the same fate as the Yazidis. ISIS is not a modern creation because these people behaved the same way in ancient history. Please read Indian history. There behaviour has not changed and never will.<br/>
If Hindus cannot step up and neutralize these traitors then you shall perish! I ask you if your own house was being attacked and a family member was helping the attackers what would you do?

There are nations who have suffered much worse: atomic bombings, indiscriminate napalm bombings (eg. Vietnam). They forgave, forgot and today live in peace. The middles east always seeks revenge at the drop of a hat, is neither able to live in peace, nor allows others to live in peace.

                            Mr.Shankar is absolutely right.Science says every action has an equal and opposite reaction.Therefore every aspect of political as well as social stand against society in general will lead to some reactions,healthy or unhealthy depending on the course adopted.Everything happens due to some reason.All the civil wars and revolutions that hve taken place right from the beginning till now was because the common people were not heard,their problems not solved in a logical manner and therefore they had to resort to unfair means.Try to recall the French Revolution and the recent uprising against Gaddafi.It is of utmost importance to find the root of the problem and then eradicate it.Whether it is terrorist attack or air raids by forces,the truth is Innocents are killed including children ,women and old people.It is the first and foremost duty of each human to stop condemning each other and look ways to bring peace and haemony in the society in our own small way.

India must distance itself in any direct conflict but can thread a path of more pragmatism based foreign policy against Nehur's blind faith on Russia.

                            Mani Shankar is the most stupid idiot there in the Congress and I daresay in the country. He may become dhimmi to any extent, he will still remain a despised hellbound Mushrik to the Islamists he is trying to please...<br/><br/>
Even Mahatma Gandhi was called lower than the lowest Muslim by the Alis despite being the only non Muslim to lead the Khilafat Jihad!<br/><br/>
He can probably think why Hindus and Sikhs are not blowing up in Pakistan and BD, why Africans are not blowing up in ME, Europe and USA. He should study the history (and present) of Muslims perpetrating the worst atrocities on hundreds of millions of people, enslaving them, raping them, forcibly converting them and castrating them so that not a trace remains of the hundreds of millions forcibly converted.<br/><br/>
The reason for the terror is Islamofascism. Nothing else. These dhimmi dimwits don't get it or just act fools. In either case, they are stupid.

                            "Great learning" is that, there are iyers, Sings, singvis and wallas from from towns, who's job is to "justify" terrorism and these people should be kept in isolation, to protect humanity !!

                            East or West ... Non Serious Politicians like Mani Shankar Aiyar in south India and Mr.Ding Vijay singh from North India are the best !! . I wonder why NDTV still take them for their columns, when their own party Congress does not consider them serious .<br/><br/>
Thankfully he has not blamed Modi ji .. as we know Mr.Aiyar will remember to find fault on Mr.Modi anywhere and every where .

                            You are right, Mani. The answer to terrorism is seeking help of an enemy nation to topple the current government. Shame on you and shame on NDTV for letting you write again. This is my last visit to this site. oh ya, go ahead, moderate this comment for speaking the truth.

I think it is time for you to retire. Your career as politician is finished and the articles you pen are thumbed down by almost everybody. Time and again your comments have backfired upon you and the 'secular' Congress. Please have pity on yourself and us, and ask Madam and the crown prince for retirement, negotiate a good pension deal. If you want to keep writing these articles, read the responses and comments we mango people make on those. It is always good to know the feedback on your work.<br/><br/>
Thanks,<br/>

                            This man has lost all credibility. Let him  do some social service instead of writing nonsensical blogs. But tell him to do social service not in Pakistan, where he finds peace and tolerance.

                            For us, peace is important. Your statements no way help solve the issue either.
