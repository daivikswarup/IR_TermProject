Headline::::Bihar Defeat Sends Clear Message to Modi



DateTime::::2015-11-08T20:06:00+05:30




                                A few quick lessons from the Bihar results:It's a victory for development.
The decisive triumph of the Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance), with Nitish Kumar re-elected to serve a third term as Chief Minister, is clearly a vote for his strong message of "vikas" (development). It was Nitish, in his earlier stints as Chief Minister,who brought "bijli, sadak, pani" (good roads, electricity and safe drinking water) to large areas of Bihar that had been deprived of those basic amenities, as well as programmes to promote girls' education. These were the things voters recalled when asked about their voting intentions, and they proved true to the leader who had provided them.It's also a victory for communal unity.
The Mahagatbandhan's other poll message was "shanti" (peace), in contrast to the BJP's communally-charged polarizing tactics and rhetoric that attempted to take divisiveness to new heights and split the vote on religious lines. Journalists reported before the voting that shanti or peace was a frequently-cited theme in their conversations with voters. Bihar, with nearly 17% of its people Muslim, may seem ripe for the communal treatment, but its survival depends on communal harmony which the Mahagathbandhan argued has been woven into the very fabric of Bihari society. The comments by BJP leaders (shamefully including the very top leaders) about Nitish and Lalu intending to give reservations to Muslims at the expense of OBCs, the statements that Pakistan would celebrate a BJP defeat, and the headline-stealing beef controversies - all whipped up to generate communal polarization - had very little impact on voters, who were far more concerned about their own livelihoods, security and their children's education.It's a triumph for Opposition Unity. 
From the start, the Congress Party and Rahul Gandhi personally worked to construct the Mahagathbandhan and keep it going. It refused to encourage any rivalry between Nitish and Lalu - no "divide and rule" here - and firmly insisted both on Nitish being the alliance's CM-designate and on the two allied parties enjoying strict parity in ticket-distribution. The results are evident for all to see. Rahul Gandhi has clearly found a winning formula that can be developed and extended all the way to 2019.The time has come for Prime Minister Modi to perform. 
I had incurred the displeasure of many in my own party last year by acknowledging that Modi's statements suggested he recognized the importance of switching from the politics of religious identity (which his party had been so notorious for propagating) to a politics of performance (which seemed to be the burden of his speeches promising "sab ka saath sab ka vikas" (development and progress for all). Unfortunately, it has become clear with every passing month that my critics were right - that Modi's actions or lack thereof prove that his development rhetoric never went beyond speech-making. There has not only been no development, no sign of economic reform, no national transformation and no jobs for the young - but far worse, there has been an over-emphasis on communal division and a distasteful display of Hindutva triumphalism across the board. The voters of Bihar have now followed those of Delhi in sending a clear message to Mr Modi: this is not what we voted for you for. For the nation's sake, let's hope he gets the message.It's bad news for pollsters. 
I have been arguing for some time now that polling is a deeply inexact science that can't work well in India because our voters simply do not reflect the homogeneity and predictability that validates random sampling in the far more uniform societies of the Western democracies. Time after time, the pollsters have been falling flat on their faces and it's happened again today, with those who predicted a close contest (and the inappropriately-named Chanakya, which confidently predicted an NDA sweep) being made to look silly. The only polling organization which got it right found the TV channel that had commissioned it refusing to broadcast its predictions because it felt they were insufficiently justified by the raw data. Personally, I stopped taking pre-election polls seriously after the Delhi debacle, but Bihar suggests that even exit polling techniques need radical revision. The only samples that can make sense would have to take into account our differences of religion, caste, region and sect, but such samples would be too large to be viable for polling organizations to reach. Simple lesson: trust the voters, not the pollsters. The only polls that count are the ones that actually involve pressing buttons on an EVM.Finally, it's good news for Indian democracy. 
The voters of Bihar have done Indian democracy a great service by rewarding development and unity, and punishing communal bigotry, polarization and arrogance. After Delhi and Bihar, the BJP government may just be chastened enough to concentrate on what the nation thought it had voted for when it gave them the mandate of 2014: development for all. The Opposition, in turn, has received a boost that will give it the confidence to stand up boldly for its values of democracy, pluralism, secularism and social justice, despite its relative paucity of numbers. 
 
The tide has turned. The main beneficiaries of this transformation can only be the Indian people.(Dr Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Hope BJP understands that the ONLY reason BJP won was because the alternative was pathetic.  But same thing can be repeated in 40 months time.  People need to see the results and do not have patience.  No doubt Modi is working hard on the fundamentals like Power sector, infra etc etc. But unless they rein in the fringe elements who think that Beef is an issue and all Muslims are unpatriotic and they can win by polarising the electorate, they are in for a rude shock. Modi is losing his aura and losing it very fast and it is time that he showed that he is in control and he is taking the country along and not just the Hindutva elements. Or else, we are set for Congress taking over the country and we have to suffer the Sibals and Chidams, The earlier the realise that the better for them and better for the country. I am a BJP sympathiser only because of the pathetic Congress and not because of any other reason.  So I think are many people who voted for BJP last time. But things have gone terribly wrong.

                            People vote parties for aspiration (some do for petty gains also). I recall so much enthusiasm last year for BJP and to change the UPA Govt. Gradually the ridding on the mandate a legitimacy has been granted to certain vociferous people to create raucous in the name of beef eating, cow has become headlines, defaming our own people and comparing SRK with Hafeez Saeed, asking certain section of the people to go to Pakistan...what nonsense. My Hindu believes never taught me such values may be RSS's neo Hinduism is very different from mine. RSS will hang the picture of the great Hindu revivalist Swami Vivekananda but never understood what Hinduism about. Preach more hatred and allow opposition to gain ground.

                            Mr. Tharoor, you sound surprised! Modi has switched his campaign message from development to communal issues because on economics he can be challenged with facts. On communal issues, he merely has to pedal fear and divisions and hope that it sticks! Modi/Shah are so amateur in their campaigns that further edfeats in other States is guaranteed. Modi leaving Delhi to campaign 35 times in Bihar shows how shallow his development agenda is at the centre

                            The story of Bihar could be written in very hilarious words. The BJP let loose their bulls(cows) on Mahagathbandhan(MGB) and Lalu tamed them, but they were still in Bihar . One man threw stones at dogs, which chased bulls(cows) away from Bihar and thus MGD won. Nitish stayed unconcerned and went on soliciting votes from Biharis stating that "Baharis" need to be kept'"Bahar"(out) for Bihar to get "Bahar"(spring). This is the story of Bihar 2015 -death of hubris at the hands of nemesis

                            It is time that all democratic people and groups should be careful to guard the country against the communal divide and unleashing of violence by the fringe goons. Especially in Bihar there is a fear that the aggrieved parties may act against the weaker sections who defied them and caused a great loss in the elections. People please ensure that no untoward incident takes place and the government may exercise preventive actions to stop the perpetrators from hurting the weak. Long live India and Long live democracy.

Rahul does not have the gravitas if either a Nitidh Kumar or for that matter even a rLalu Prasad. I think you need to comevto terms with the fact that the Congress is a spent force and that Rahul is an uninspiring, insipid leafer who should quit politics and try for a job as an LDC in a nationalised bank.

                            What was Tharoor's analysis on why Congress lost power in the center?  There must be some analysis there, surely he isn't only helping his rivals to get better.  If his analysis wasn't that the Congress cannot win under Rajeev Gandhi because he isn't fit to be a chai wala (pun intended) how can he run a vast country like India.  His points sound good but are not at all based on facts.<br/><br/>
It's a victory for development.<br/>
If Nitish had allied with the BJP he would be called communal and his past achievements would not have mattered.  He should be now called corrupt for joining forces with Lalu the first MP to lose his seat because of corruption.  Can he really do any further development in the state having Lalu's two sons giving him orders.  They have more seats than him.<br/><br/>
It's also a victory for communal unity.<br/>
Nitish and Lalu are more communal than the BJP.  Here the BJP lost the battle in communalising the election.  Can BJP ever be more protective of the cow than Lalu?  He is a Yadav descended of Krishna, he brought cows with him to Delhi when he was MP.  Even when he made some innocent remarks against the cow he said devil was responsible for those statements.  About reservations, did BJP seriously believe that Biharis would take them seriously when they said Lalu was going to cut the reservation of backward class.  That's the only thing he gave Bihar, he took a lot though.  Crackers in Pakistan, Shah was in a fix he couldn't go all out communal so he made this pathetic attempt.  After all his boss is on the world stage and will have to answer to the world leaders.  If Shah really wanted to go communal, talk about Bangladesh, nobody cares about Pakistan in Bihar.  Talk about Bangladeshis coming to Bihar and doing love jihad.  What is completely amusing is that Modi called Lalu and Nitish superstitious, that's how far those 2 took it.  The same BJP which has claimed Hindus invented planes, surgery etc were amused by Nitish and Lalu to call them superstitious.<br/><br/>
It's a triumph for Opposition Unity. <br/>
I am sure you realize by now that the BJP has no place for you.  Even Shotgun two time MP was sidelined.  I don't blame you for sucking up to Rajeev Gandhi by giving him credit.  Well played sir.<br/><br/>
The time has come for Prime Minister Modi to perform. <br/>
Modi has been working hard tirelessly trying to get investment for India, cutting red tape, promoting "make in india", cleaning rivers, building smart cities, etc.  If you think this is not good enough, Mr. Tharoor you are pretty generous with your advice.  Pray tell what should he do to improve the Indian economy.<br/><br/>
It's bad news for pollsters. <br/>
It's an art not science.<br/><br/>
Finally, it's good news for Indian democracy.<br/>
Indian democracy has always been robust.  Definitely don't need a certificate from you who is member of a party where one family calls the shots.

                            It is going to be an uphill task for BJP and the PM to explain away the humiliating defeat in Bihar polls. They should do real introspection and objectively analyse the reasons for defeat in spite of a high level no holds barred campaign by the PM. Do we see the ground slipping under Modi when he globe trots to Madison Square Garden, Silicon valley, Dubai and now to Wembley. The PM should set his priorities right whether he wants to improve the country or build foreign relationship; whether he wants to meet Obama or meet the Aam admi. Is rewriting history a priority? Can we ever write off the contributions of Nehru to independent India? Digital revolution was started by Sam Pitroda under Rajiv Gandhi. Let us not get into the Ostrich syndrome and learn to be be more tolerant. Off late the PM has become the de facto Foreign Minister relegating Sushma Swaraj to the background to do only rescue and refugee work. One can be very popular abroad with rhetoric and high tech showmanship but bad mouthing political adversaries on a foreign soil repeatedly is stretching it too far.  It only amounts to washing dirty linen in public bringing down the esteem and image of the country and self in the international arena.There is definitely a disconnect at what is being preached and practised. We have heard him talk twice from the Red Fort but how many of his commitments have really seen action and pursued to their logical conclusions.  Even now nothing is lost and he can push through the reforms by carrying all sections of the people with him and having meaningful dialogues with opposition parties with the single agenda of Bharat ka vikas. He need to reign in the fringe elements in the party with an iron hand and restore the confidence of the people common man and the intelligentsia. The writing on the wall is very clear and Bihar result is a wake up call for BJP and PM Modi.

                            It is completely true that Nitish Kumar won Bihar on his excellent performance, and fully deserved to win and do more good work. It is also true that the BJP made some remarkable campaign errors that led to its flop show. But Tharoor is not the person to point it out. His Congress party has made a few gains in Bihar by hanging on to Nitish's coat tails. But what about Tharoor's home state of Kerala which has seen an equivalent wash out in the local body polls whose results yesterday proved disastrous for the Congress led UDF? Tharoor is silent on that! The massive corruption and scams indulged in by the Congress and its allies led to a virtual rout. Both the LDF and the BJP put up vastly improved shows based only on the scams of the Congress. We look forward to Tharoor's analysis of that rout and its implications for the Congress. Your turn, Dr. Tharoor.

                            MrTharoor just one day before the results of Bihar elections, Kerala's local body poll results were announced. What is the performance of your party there? Indeed poor performance. In fact BJP did better than expected, particularly in Thiruvanthapuram (your LS constituency).Congress leaders like you and MS Aiyer are burning a lot of mid night oil to peep in to the affairs of BJP and analyse its performance, than making efforts to build your own ruined party.Yes,BJP lost Bihar, against a formidable alliance of Castiest parties.But, now it occupies the entire political space as the main party of opposition.That is the progress it made compared to 2010.It's vote share also improved significantly.It augurs well for the party on long term basis.

                            BJP lost due to 1. Simple Arithmetic of united opposition vote share 2. Negative Campaign (No Lessons Learnt from Delhi) 3. No control over their own members 4. Communal Statements (No Lessons Learnt from UP/Bihar By-Polls). Modi won in 2014 not because of Gujarat but because there was no other alternative. If there is an alternative to BJP/Congress, People are voting them to power. If still both national parties don't learn from their mistake, we will see National Parties 'mukt' Bharat.

                            I am quite surprised it took so long to see through the drama we have been witnessing the past 18 months. BJP will not change its stance as they have nothing better to offer.....hope better days are really back.  Sincerely wish we had the caliber of Shashi Tharoor leading this country... unlike these pathetic performers.

                            Does this mean that a defeat of 2014 for the Congress was a message to Ms Sonia Gandhi and Mr Rahul Gandhi. If so, have they taken corrective steps. Why our country remains devoid of  roads, electricity etc even after 60 years of congress rule.

                            Shashi Tharoor is more intelligent rather wiser than this, time to rise above his political ambition. It was a vote for Lalu Yadav and caste politics...speak to any literate Bihari working and suffering outside Bihar...he is very sad as he sees that even his children will have to suffer the same way as he has...what a country we are..how can we allow a condemned criminal to participate in the polling process...doesnt it shame our media to promote him every day...what message are we giving to our children and the rest of the world...

                            Come on be serious! Lalu a convict who is out on bail, winning means it is vote for development, (mind you he has got the maximum seats)<br/>
It is lesson for BJP , no doubt. but let us not overread into this. Caste has won. pure and simple. To say NO reforms etc is silly, yes we can always say it is not adequate. Lalu who was out in the cold has been given a new lease of life because of Nitish's ego, having lost the PM race. Now Nitish has to fight Lalu in his own turf. Lalu wants his sons a Dy CM.... got the message??

                            Happy to see BJP lose this time. It had constantly tried to divide the electorate on religious lines (making rubbish comments, thinking as if Bihar junta were a fool). Bihar delivered a lesson that Amit Shah will remember for lifetime.

                            Modi may have have good intentions; but clearly, lacking vision and action. This is what the ordinary people started thinking, today, after 18 months of missing ground level actions. He should have kept some technocrats in hand and used them in planning India's future. As I have commented many times, with facts and figures, the Govt should look in to our own resources make them usable. For that, it can concentrate only on two most important areas a) Railways - for a vast country with billion people, transportation of goods and supply at a cheaper rate is very essential and b) Power - to propel the machinery, at an affordable cost keeping in view the climate change issues &amp; carbon emission penalties. Doubling the rail network, modernizing, and powering it with electricity - all using local technologies and man power - would go a long way in bettering the economy and providing jobs to millions while reducing oil import to just a half the number of barrels .....

                            Invasion, conquest and accumulation is the rolling tide of history. India had great Hindu Kings eg Chandragupta Maurya &amp; his grandson Asoka and there were great muslim kings eg Akbar, Sher Shah. Their actions must be seen through the window of power and the securing of it. Not through the window of religion.<br/>
India is a land of wisdom so that the dogma of Hindutva or any other brand can never prosper in it. The RSS/BJP combine must learn to live with the facts of history.

                            Mr. Tharoor, what kind of message did your Congress(I) party get from the series of election results over the past few years? Surprisingly, you never came up with similar blogs back then. Why so?

                            Where were you Mr Tharoor? I thought you would be at the forefront of this Bihar campaign to support your party and the ideals you believed in. You were only visible your absence. <br/><br/>
I am also very amused by your deafening silence over the "tolerance" issues that are being widely discussed in this country. <br/><br/>
Where are you? At least it is good to see an article by you "post" election. Wake up and get in the driver's seat. India and your party need you now more than ever.

Why you dont speak on beef-eating in kerala, wow what a unity people showed by eating beef just to protest of one person dead on beef-eating spark, but your people will never show unity in other national interests like cross border firing, terrorist attacks etc.

                            The chanel has given soooo much information about Mr. Tharoor. You should also add that, Mr. Tharoor has been facing inquiry by police, for his alleged involvement in allegedly unnatural death of his wife. His statements only prove, Mr. Tharoor is yet another author, like Nehru's kin and few others who brag around Des &amp; nites. Out come Bihar election has "defined" how caste &amp; religion can win in Bihar. Yadavs behind  fodder thief and Muslims UNITED in entirety. Whereas, Hindus got split due to soooo many sub-sects and getting mislead-- more so coz of illiteracy in Bihar. This result ONLY proves failure of BJP to push Hindutva and time has come for Hindus to unite.

                            Any comments on today's main news in Kerala on "K M Mani's Bar Bribery Case Ruling by High Court of Kerala". Let that be the next blog.Here are few comments in advance as it is the most debated topic in all Malayalam Channels:<br/><br/>
Though the Bar Bribery is alleged to have started in March/April 2014, it took more than 1 and 1/2 years for the Finance and Law Minister, K M Mani to think of resignation. Had it been a Minister with Hindu or Muslim Name, he or she would have resigned long ago.(Eg. K Karunakaran, Balakrishna Pillai, K P Viswanathan , P K Kunhalikutty, Shashi Tharoor etc). They were forced to resign by Congress or Muslim League at the slightest doubt of corruption. Many of them emerged scotfree at a later stage. Since K M Mani has the strong support of Christian Catholic Churches and since the top leaders of Congress like Oommen Chandy, A K Antony, P C Chacko, P P Thankachan and Joseph are Christians themselves, they gave a very, very,very long rope to another fellow Christian, K M Mani. It is high time that Muslim League, Hindu Leaders of Congress, non-Corrupt,secular Christian leaders of Kerala Congress(Mani/Joseph/Thomas/B) like P C George, P C Thomas, P J Joseph and Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) form a Political Front to save Kerala Society. Left Parties like CPI(M) and CPI are definitely non-Corrupt but are very,very Lazy and cannot achieve Economic Development or Job Creation in Kerala.Because of Left Parties' non-constructive mindset, lakhs of Keralites had to migrate out to Gulf. Kerala is economically surviving on Gulf Remmittances. Otherwise, "KERALA" would have been a highly literate "BIHAR".  Atleast from now on, Christian Catholic Churches should concentrate on Spirituality, Philanthropy(without religious conversion) and Charity, not on Politics or Real Estate or Business Development Activities.
