Headline::::Mani-Talk: J&K's Best Hope is PDP, Omar and Congress Together



DateTime::::2014-12-29T15:02:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Adolescent maidens in Elizabethan England would pluck daisies from the fields and peel the petals one by one, alternately reciting, "He loves me; he loves me not"! The curious election results from the state of Jammu and Kashmir have left politicians indulging in much the same exercise as they try to work out which of several possible combinations is the most attractive and feasible. The obvious combination in purely arithmetical terms is the BJP going with the PDP. Together, they would have some 53 seats in a House of 87, thus ensuring an apparently stable majority. I stress the word "apparently" for hidden behind the bare figures is the incompatibility of programmes and purposes and the cleavage along religious and regional lines. All the 25 seats the BJP has won are in Jammu. In Kashmir, the BJP lost its deposit in 35 of the 36 seats it contested. The PDP did secure two seats in Jammu, but 26 of its 28 seats are from the Valley. The virulent rhetoric of the election campaign showed the wide distance between the two parties in their respective approaches to the governance of J&K.  The BJP then and earlier accused the PDP of being "soft" on militancy and inclined to be understanding of the protestors who are collectively labeled "stone-throwers". The BJP loves to project itself in Jammu and the rest of India as the most muscular of Indian parties, determined to firmly and unrelentingly stamp out militancy and infiltration at any price. If the BJP were to go "soft" while in the J&K government, it would be castigated by the RSS and the Sangh Parivar and lose much of its appeal in Jammu and the rest of the country; if the PDP were to take a hard and cold line, it would instantly lose much of its new-found support in the Valley. Similarly, on the continued application in the Valley of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), the PDP insists on the progressive reduction and eventual removal of the Act, while the BJP reacts with alarm to any suggestion of dilution or elimination. AFSPA cannot be strengthened and weakened at the same time. Yet, Jammu, as a whole, demands the implementation of the Act be strengthened, while Kashmir, without a shadow of doubt, has voted definitively against AFSPA. On Article 370, which confers a special status on J&K in that no Central law can apply to the State unless and until the State Assembly votes in favour of it, as well as enables the State to have a Constitution of its own (with special powers to the Governor that no other Governor enjoys), the BJP has for years been insistent that it is Article 370, above all, that has stood in the way of the full integration of the State with the Union of India. The PDP, in line with all other political formations of the Valley, is adamant that Article 370 is the bulwark that enables the State to maintain its separate identity. It also allows the Kashmiri parties to campaign on the their right to "self-rule" (PDP) or "full autonomy" (National Conference). The Congress, for its part, is pledged to "the sky is the limit" as far as autonomy is concerned and all parties in Parliament (other than the BJP and Shiv Sena) are in favour of the retention of Article 370. The State government of Jammu & Kashmir cannot both have and not have Article 370. The BJP have, therefore, sought to appease their ranks and their opponents by saying that they want a debate on 370 and will abide by the verdict. They little seem to realize that a debate that throws the issue seriously into question will itself inflame passions in the Valley. In any case, the debate has been on ever since the founder of the Jan Sangh, Syama Prosad Mookherjee, broke from the Nehru government, of which he was a Minister, to demand, among other things, the abrogation of J&K's special status. (In fact, he died in Srinagar while protesting Sheikh Abdullah's government). So, what is there new to debate? And where will the debate take place? In the J&K Assembly? God forbid - for the current political divide between the regions will then become a powder-keg. And any Kashmiri political party that agreed to formally allow the State's special status to be questioned would be left with the mark of Cain on its forehead - doomed to suspicion of "fifth-columnism" forever. Then there is the question of "development" - a point being underlined by the BJP in a vain attempt to keep attention away from more fundamental questions raised by "ghar wapasi" and other such divisive religion-based issues. The BJP economic agenda is founded on bringing not only foreign direct investment into the State but also on encouraging domestic investment from outside the State. This immediately raises the question of land, that, under State law dating back nearly a century, is reserved for State residents and cannot be bought or sold by outsiders. This poses no problem for public sector enterprises, but when the BJP's Central Government emphasizes big business private enterprise as the road to economic Valhalla, and at the same time threatens to dilute the Land Acquisition Act that they themselves voted for but a year ago, any thinking Kashmiri is bound to wonder whether, in the name of "development", the real aim is not to expropriate Kashmiri land and render the aam Kashmiri deprived of the very rights that Sheikh Abdullah fought the Maharajah over in the 1920s and that led to his being hailed as the Sher-e-Kashmir.  These are not minor differences of policy that can be ironed out in a hypocritically-drafted Common Minimum Programme. These are fundamental differences that go to the root of J&K's existence as a special and separate entity.  A BJP-PDP coalition will, therefore, be opposed tooth and nail by many, perhaps most, PDP legislators - whatever Muzaffar Hussain Baig (the PDP's leading advocate of such an alliance) might have to say. Even if such a coalition were to be opportunistically cobbled together, it just cannot last. Thus, what arithmetically constitutes a "stable" government would, politically, be a bundle of contradictions, bound to collapse sooner than later under the weight of its own internal incompatibilities.  That leaves open the option of a BJP-NC coalition. Along with Sajjad Lone's two-member People's Conference and a couple of independents, a bare majority can be forged. But the discredited National Conference would find itself further discredited within minutes of such a coalition being formed. The argument that both Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah have been members of BJP governments in the past will not wash because they were with the BJP when a moderate like Atal Behari Vajpayee was at the helm. Now we have at the head of the BJP central government a fanatic RSS pracharak who has spent a life-time preaching all the things that have so totally alienated the Valley from the saffron forces, reinforced by his refusal to rein in the Yogi Adityanaths and Giriraj Singhs and Sadhvi Jyotis that adorn his Parliamentary ranks and the Togadias and Singhals who articulate what he clearly thinks. Omar's NC will be seen as sliming its way back to power through the back-door after losing the confidence of the people of the State - and that too in the company of the very elements whom the Kashmiris have demonstrated in these elections are anathema to them. Moreover, for the same reasons as those adumbrated above in respect of a PDP-BJP coalition, any NC-BJP coalition would be riddled with the same contradictions and denigrated as amounting to sleeping with the enemy. A third alternative might be a PDP-Congress coalition with the outside or inside support of a few independents. While mathematically possible at a pinch, the coalition would be fragile and little able to withstand the stresses and strains of ruling for six long years (In Jammu and Kashmir, elections are held once in six years; for the rest of the country, every five years: that distinction would go if Article 370 were abrogated). The PDP would have the advantage in such a coalition of explaining to its followers that the Congress has secured representation in this election in all three regions of the State - Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh - but that might prove frail compensation for a government that survives on a hair's breadth. That leaves the fourth option of a coalition between the PDP and the NC, an impossibility at first sight but, on taking a second look, entirely feasible to keep Jammu and Kashmir together and safe from the malignant designs of the BJP, united in the aims that unite the people of the Valley, ready and able to pursue "autonomy" above all. If, moreover, the Congress were to render outside (or inside) support to such a coalition, the coalition would be stable, constructive, purposive and representative of all three regions of the State. Will the parties have the wisdom to follow this last course? We will know very shortly.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

Congress - no one wants. neither PDP nor NC nor people of J &amp; K.<br/><br/>

                            Got it Mani... 1. Nothing should change with J&amp;K. Much like what your party did with rest of the country since 1947. Then only can you and your son in laws will be able to milk money illegally. With J&amp;K, its milking misguided minority votes from ret of the country. 2. All the parties except for BJP and SS oppose removal of article 370. Yes, because they don't see any advantages in appeasing minority whereas you do. 3. BJP says they will come hard in militants and i am appalled to see you try to make a point that there isn't any need. The apparent 'stone throwers' are exactly what you want. Uneducated, development deprived misguided youth so that you and your party can milk the minority cow by fooling them..... For you, every step towards development is not acceptable, every step towards transparency is wrong step, every step forward is suicidal. With this mentality, you and your party will soon be part of history.

                            Ha ha ha..what a joke...<br/>
If PDP can align with NC it doesn't need support of Congress than (28 + 17)..! Why they would include useless Congress..?<br/><br/>
If PDP can go with Congress, it would be short of 45...28+12 +..?<br/><br/>
If PDP &amp; BJP go ahead - most stable development oriented government + full center support. Both can put a side some controversial issues where both principally differ like BJP can put a side - 370 &amp; little flexible in AFSPA. Similarly PDP can put a side - selfrule and little flexible in AFSPA. AFSPA can be removed where no militancy presence and continue in border attached area and also highly militancy area.<br/>
this would be win win situation for both party.<br/><br/>
PDP can say in Kashmir that we hold BJP's 370 idea and same way BJP can say in Jammu that it has hold PDP's selfrule idea.

                            Very well written. Modi will have no problem in aligning with the PDP which he had criticized so heavily during the assembly election campaigns. He had called the NCP as Naturally Corrupt Party, and then did not hesitate to join hands with them. But, bhakts will keep supporting him, in spite of all the U turns that he has done.

                            To use MS Iyer's own words about the NC, he would love it if somehow the Congress could 'slime' into goverment after having been totally rejected by the populace.<br/><br/>
There is only one logical combination - PDP and BJP, since this is the overwhelming mood of the two main sections of the state - Jammu and Kashmir. The elections results, combined with televised comments of voters is clear - they want change. The common desire of both parts of the state is for development. No one cares a fig for MS Iyer's leftist developmental model which the Congress inflicted on the country since Independence.<br/><br/>
Starting from a pragamatic agreement on a development plan which would be a clean break from the Congress-NC past, the BJP and PDP MUST negotiate a historic agreement between the wishes of the people of Jammu and and those of the people of Kashmir. As the separatists have been firmly rejected by a majority of the people, an agreement between these two parties could finally bring peace and development to J&amp;K.

Isn't congress now begging for allies from a time where allies were begging you for coalition? Isn't congress like a desperate last passenger wanting to climb any bus to reach a destination? Your results speak for your deeds or misdeeds rather. Thats why yourself and other congi chamchaas have come to tbe dailies to vent your anger against the govt, knowing fully there is nothing you can do to challenge them politically. Its all because of your non governance and loot. So shut up and keep losing

New beginnings can happen with a paradigm shift with the PDP and BJP coming together. Although the mandate is in sharp contrast between Jammu and the Valley, the necessity of working together would widen the horizons and thinking of both the BJP and PDP. It could have a beneficial impact on the polity of J&amp;K as well.

BJP and PDP should together try to bring J&amp; K back to national stream,,, for that PDP and BJP will have to compromise on their some of the tough views , BjP should ensure PDP never supports terrorists there and BJP should concentrate on development and employment creation in the state which will make youngsters shun terrorism and seperatism ... and Iyer like congress leaders should keep mum for at least one year on J&amp;K or take foreign trip as their Amul leader has done now ...

                            The most rediculous blog I have ever seen. Introduction of the article itself was a grave mistake. Nehru himself himself assumed that over a period it would get diluted. Kahmiris fear that they would be deprived of their precious land if outsiders are allowed to invest in industrial projects in the state, at the same time the youth complain about lack of jobs and development and resulting unemployment. A hundred year law cannot hold good now. Our own laws were changed in early ninties during congress regime to pave way for greater overseas invesment, after which the country's development and progress took off. Both congress and the BJP are on the same side. Kashmir's economy has been heavily dependant on tourism which cannot sustain in times of militancy and terrorism and local unrest. This fact must be understood by all kashmiris and not allow the politicians to rule for their gains.

You represent a failed party who have got 'first rank' among the failed students. Stop hallucinating a grand backdoor entry into J&amp;K...Your combination of PDP+NC+Cong will not work for the reasons you have given in the article.<br/>
What is needed is the full integration of J&amp;K into rest of India so that all can prosper. If this is not possible re-election is the best bet

The congress is communal party creating rift by divide and rule between Hindus and Muslims.

                            History repeats itself. <br/>
In 1996, similar arguments were made at the centre to keep the rising power BJP/AB Vajpayee out of power at the centre, every major political party sans BJP formed an unholy alliance to form a coalition government at the centre. Two Prime Ministers and two years later BJP/NDA was elected to government. When disparate political parties cobble a coalition with the sole intention of keeping BJP out of power, people will see the unfairness and BJP will sweep Jammu AND Ladakh this time with a sprinkling of seats from the Valley. <br/>
When we talk about Jammu and Kashmir, these nuts somehow forget Jammu should get enough representation, not just the Valley that has Pundits driven out. Think of Jammu too, it is not just about having a Muslim from the Valley at the helm. Mani ofcourse, is too stupid to get that.

Still, this person is trying to prove that he is loyal to the dynasty in different ways, at least twice a week, with his blogs.

                            This could be a wishful thinking of the writer,but ground realities are quite different .Three parties whom the writer wishes to join hands to form a coalition,are poles apart from each other on political platform.They have tried alliances in the past but these collapsed.That's the reason,political situation has reached a stage of deadlock,leader of one political party, Omar Abdullah of National Conference is off to London.PDP has said it is even prepared  for a short term Governor's Rule if no solution is found by the time tenure of present Assembly of the State expires by January 17.Things are not so easy in this State embedded with complex political situations.

The voters are saying that you are not as smart as you think you are and your views are out of tune with reality. May be you should quit politics and write a book on "uninterruptible and uninterrupted" dialogue between a group of hyenas and a deer.

                            Even when the writing is on the wall, Mr. Aiyar refuses to see it, and prefers to day dream. The people of J&amp;K do not want the Congress, and the election results prove it. Congress has got enough chances in the past, and have not been able to resolve, or make any progress with the problems in Kashmir. BJP's win is mainly due to the extensive campaigning by Modi, as well as the promises of development in the region. It is now up to the BJP and the PDP to live up to expectations.<br/><br/>
Of course, there has been talk that in Jammu, votes were being asked in the name of caste and sect affiliations. Let us hope that the BJP is able to rise above these petty matters when they actually share power with the PDP.

PDP+NC and aligning with Congress is suiside for both PDP and NC. It will help BJP in a long run. It is going to create a situation how Congress and peudo secular janata parivar brought down the Vajpayee government twice.  In a long run it will give milage to BJP if they sits in opposition in J&amp;K.

Why are you getting rejected ? Try to find answers instead of criticising government.<br/><br/>
btw  why are you a RS member and not LS ? Fine answers if you can...

                            Dear Mani, your party is not in a position to even give an opinion. It just doesn't matter.
