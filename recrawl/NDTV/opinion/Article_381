Headline::::BCCI, an Emirate with Soul of Dubai, Reserves of Abu Dhabi by Mukul Kesavan



DateTime::::2015-01-29T05:48:00+05:30



Mukul Kesavan is a writer based in Delhi. His most recent book is 'Homeless on Google Earth' (Permanent Black, 2013).
	Long-time observers of the BCCI know that it used to be cricket's answer to the medieval city state. No Medici controlled Florence as comprehensively as the BCCI controlled cricket in India. The Board of Control was an independent principality, located in India, surrounded by India, but not of India. Its jurisdiction over cricket in India was as absolute as the Vatican's over Catholicism; it brooked no interference in its affairs, not even from the nation state that enclosed it.
	Its last pope showed his cardinals that he was the god of most things by turning conductor and orchestrating a symphony of conflicting interests. His orchestra pit was crowded with cricketers, ex-cricketers, captains, captains of industry, consultants, commentators, cooing starlets, all on the same page, bobbing to his baton. During his reign most living things in cricket's jungle became the Board's creatures, bound by contract, muted by money and sworn to servility. Not everyone: the Great Indian Bedi, never a herd animal, wouldn't be corralled but he was an exception. Most errant beasts that held out were forced back into the fold by the threat of excommunication. In the context of the godless present, this meant not the eternal absence of the Lord's grace, but the permanent loss of the Board's cash.
	The Board's independence was secured not by defying Leviathan but by co-opting it. Sharad Pawar, Arun Jaitley, Rajeev Shukla, even Narendra Modi, have all helped administer cricket in India. Unluckily for the BCCI, the Supreme Court couldn't be squared and so this cricketing emirate with Dubai's soul and Abu Dhabi's reserves finds itself in danger of being regulated like a public sector undertaking. The Supreme Court ruling got one thing exactly right: Indian cricket's original sin was the amendment of the virtuous clause in the BCCI's constitution that barred its office holders from taking a financial stake in any matches or tournaments organized by the Board. It was this (retrospective) amendment that allowed N. Srinivasan, then treasurer of the BCCI, to buy an IPL franchise, the Chennai Super Kings. The conflict of interest that this created - especially after Srinivasan rose to become the president of the BCCI - was so enormous, so brazen, so perversely exemplary, that people involved with cricket's economy felt free to wallow in their own, smaller, conflicts.
	One of the Board's many apologists, appearing on a televised discussion of the Supreme Court's intervention, ingeniously cited the many conflicts of interest that Srinivasan's example had engendered, to normalize his own. If men like M.S. Dhoni and Rahul Dravid could hold sinecures at India Cements while captaining teams in the IPL, why were people so exercised about Srinivasan's double role? The short answer to this is that a) Srinivasan's position as Indian cricket's primate and CSK's boss made his conflicts of interest a systemic threat to the health of Indian cricket, and b) Srinivasan's conflicts created an actual, not theoretical, crisis of credibility for Indian cricket. But it's worth taking the apologist's question seriously and supplying a longer answer to understand the cricketing culture that allowed these conflicts of interest to seem normal, even legitimate. While trying to understand Indian cricket's deafness to the notion of a conflict of interest, it's useful to bear in mind a historical fact: the BCCI transitioned from an oligarchy of patrons to an oligarchy of rentiers and entrepreneurs in twenty years.
	Nominally, the BCCI presides over a pyramidal system of cricket administration based on indirect election. In actual fact, most electoral colleges are owned by local grandees. Often a business family will dominate the local cricket association for decades. The elections which legitimize the present system have more in common with the politics of rigged pocket boroughs in 18th-century England than the broad democracy of republican India. Elections to the BCCI, the apex body of Indian cricket, are often accompanied by a chorus of allegations about rigging, gerrymandering and accreditation.
	The BCCI is run by a cabal of colonial-style patrons. This selfperpetuating clique struck oil less than twenty years ago. It recognized the potential of revenue streams created by economic liberalization and successfully connected an opaque clubof amateur administrators with real money. The coming of cable television and the consolidation of a national television audience created the revenues that underwrote the first generation of endorsement superstars: Kapil Dev, Azharuddin, Tendulkar. Once Doordarshan telecast cricket as a kind of republican duty to India's cricketmad citizens; then private television channels learnt it was a privilege for which they had to pay vast sums.
	The game was so comprehensively monetized that the BCCI began demanding fees for photographing matches and doing radio commentary. The idea that cricket was news or even that it was an event in the real world that could be reported on, gratis, gave way to the idea that cricket was proprietary entertainment, which could only be captured in pictures or the spoken word for a fee. Cricinfo briefly stopped calling IPL teams by their franchise names because it was advised that these names were commercial properties that couldn't be used without payment.
	The monetizing of cricket occurred within an administrative culture where BCCI's officials still saw themselves as 'honorary' patrons. Before the boom, these men had leveraged their status as cricket's patrons into social standing as city grandees. For ex-rajas and aspirational businessmen-traditionally, big business didn't bother with cricket-cricket was a way of being someone on the regional or national stage.
	N. Srinivasan's back story fits the model. He ran India Cements, he was genuinely interested in sport and he was a pillar of Madras society. For him, as for the Rungtas in Rajasthan or Dalmiya in Bengal, cricket was a route to social consequence and the public eye. In Madras, Srinivasan was preceded as patron by two other industrialists - A.C. Muthiah and his father, M.A. Chidambaram- after whom the stadium at Chepauk is named. It's important to recognize that men like Chidambaram, Muthiah and Srinivasan didn't make money out of the game before the boom. They actually spent their own money subsidizing cricketers and cricket because this was what patrons did. In this way, the men who governed Indian cricket came to see themselves as benefactors and the men who played cricket in India learnt to recognize them as such. Through the long shamateur epoch of Indian cricket, cricketers were supported by sinecures in private companies and public-sector undertakings, and socialized into the role of dependent clients. It was a recognition forced upon them by the need to make a living in a sport that had no business model and generated no money.
	These patron-client relationships survived the monetization of Indian cricket that happened, it's worth remembering, with bewildering speed. Even after successful cricketers became rich men, members of a sporting super-elite, they went along with being infantilized as clients. There were three broad reasons for this.
	One, gratitude. They remembered the hard times and were grateful for the support that patrons like Srinivasan had extended to the sport. India Cements had dozens of players on its rolls. It supported league cricket in Madras and helped players-not necessarily international players - make a living. (It wasn't alone in this. Sungrace Mafatlal supported cricket generously in Bombay; Sachin Tendulkar joined its Times Shield team in 1990 after his Test debut. It is something of an irony that this apparel brand didn't survive the economic liberalization that helped make both Tendulkar and the BCCI fabulously wealthy.)
	Two, pragmatism. Players recognized that while the financial basis of the sport and their own financial standing might have been transformed by sponsorship, endorsements and television revenue, the men who ran this new money spinning machine were the same patrons who had runtheshamateur, shabby-genteel set-up in the earlier era. It made complete sense to say yes if a patron like Srinivasan wanted you on his rolls even if the money from the sinecure made no real difference to your net worth.
	Three, fear. To annoy the BCCI was to be exiled from Indian cricket and its economy; it was much safer to acknowledge the power of these 'honorary' patrons than to be your own man. Here the ruthless purge of the Indian Cricket League rebels was the cautionary tale. A Board that could unperson Kapil Dev, arguably the greatest Indian cricketer of the television age, for daring to dabble in an unauthorized league, was not to be crossed.
	Thus, administrators like Srinivasan, persuaded of their virtue because of their generosity as patrons, were consumed by a sense of entitlement that made the very suggestion of a conflict of interest an impertinence. And players, used to deferring to patrons who made their livelihoods possible, found it hard to break the habit of clientage even when they didn't need the money. The idea that a sinecure might constitute a conflict of interest must have seemed preposterous: how could something endorsed by Srinivasan, uber-patron and undisputed master of the cricketing universe, be wrong?
	Now that the Supreme Court has ruled that he was wrong, that there is such a thing as a conflict of interest and that the amendment of rule 6.2.4 was illegal, Indian cricket's supple auxiliaries have started airing their doubts about Srinivasan. The ex-player, the ex-IPL franchise manager, the marketing consultant, the sports management agent, the plausible commentator, have begun shyly sharing their long-brewed conviction that something was amiss. Shyly, because it isn't yet clear that the sheikh is dead and given Srinivasan's past resilience, who can blame them?
	Will Indian cricket be regulated into virtue by the Supreme Court? It's hard to tell. But we do know that a precedent has been set by the Court: the judiciary has stepped in and taken charge of the Board's affairs. It has dismissed the BCCI's claim of being a private body. It has amended its constitution, instructed Srinivasan to either sell CSK or withdraw from Board elections, and assigned the reform of the BCCI to a committee of three retired judges. It will be a tasty irony if the crony capitalism of the Board's cabal provokes a creeping nationalization of Indian cricket.(Source: The Telegraph)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Makes sense. Makes a LOT of sense. My contribution is that I stopped watching IPL couple of years back after I smelled a rat. Given so many financial interests involved, I wonder if BCCI can ever be made stain-free? But it is true that cricket's reputation in India is permanently destroyed. It is no longer a gentleman's game that the Englishmen envisioned.

                            After decades of second class treatment by the likes of England and Australia, India finally emerges as an unchallenged powerhouse in cricket. What do we do? Much like in other sectors, those in positions of authority abuse their power, those who were given the privilege of shaping the future of the game, to finally be the custodians, hurt its credibility, and become a threat to the games survival. A classic case of "killing the goose that lays golden eggs."

                            No not really, he could just "sell" his stake in CSK to a puppet (relative/friend) through a benami and continue to Lord over BCCI and also own CSK forever.

                            Look at the marvel of money. It can unite people like Rajeev Shukla, Jaitely, Modi, Lalu and Pawar ; without even a murmur.   None of these worthies ever  raised even a little finger against the colossal impropriety in BCCI.

                            It is a very critical analysis of the power 'money' wields on this "sport' It is this  attraction to money  which makes the current youngsters to  some how find a  place in some team which is driving the younger generation to neglect everything else and concentrate on finding a place  in some team. Need less to say they are driven by the ambition that a place in  couple of "one day matches" or tests will settle their future for advertisements, product endorsements and monthly or yearly retainers from the rich BCCI. or other sources.  During my morning walks I find parents both mothers and fathers driving their  kids with sleepy eyes in the morning to some training  academy with fervent hope that their kid will hit the jack pot some day. Good luck to all of them

                            What a brilliant article from Mukul Kesavan. Always liked his views and articulation on television. Especially liked his analogy on benefactor- client relation to the evolution of BCCI and perhaps also Indian society at large. Does'nt this benefactor- client relation pervade other aspects of our society as well?- Journalism, Politics, Bollywood perhaps? The end of the decaying- semi feudal, semi colonial, superstructure and replacing  with comprador bourgeousie and crony capitalists and finally a complete shift towards advanced capitalism with monetisation and establishment of rules of law which questions conflict of interest clauses and questions the virtues of even the benefactors and his entitlements.<br/>
Just wish that Mul Kesavan intervenes more often. Look forward to his more of his articles..

                            It is interesting article but I believe people have not understood the conflict of interest issue.  Conflict does not arise just by merely being in a situation.  It is only when the situation is manipulated or abused. In the case of Srinivasan owning CSK, my personal reading is that it has actually been more a disadvantage to him and the team. If he had held CSK thro a benami, he could have brazenly manipulated the system including fixing umpires, venues schedules, etc to favour CSK rather than having to tread carefully. And this is what is likely to happen now. So for all those conflict of interest advocates it is now that the real conflict starts and I can tell you it will be interesting

                            Spot on analysis: and what a treat is Mukul Kesvan's language. It's concise, picturesque, and precise in conveying his thoughts. Every youngster of today who writes in inarticulate SMSese, Twitterese or Facebookese should be asked to read his articles!

                            Unlike his denunciation of Modi, in this case the author has got his analysis right.  However, most of his readers would find his allegories to Western literature and history incomprehensible.  That said what he has said can be summed up with the word corruption.  Well all of us know that!  What people find difficult to understand is that 'heroes' like Dhoni could be up to his neck in this.  Those of us who saw his disastrous leadership in leading India to two HUGE defeats in two series against England and Australia (in the latter the coward Dhoni 'retired' mid-series so that his hero status would be retained), knew there was something amiss when he was not sacked after the first series defeat in England.  So disastrous was that defeat that those of us who has spent a fortune had to leave certain matches well before the end as the players had simply given up before that matches even started!  Dhoni who started life as a simple Bihari Babu (now a Jhrkhandi Babu) accumulated what was for him untold riches.  It was said he had 7 Audi cars and 200 motorcycles.  Dhoni has kept mum to any questions asked of him.  Well he would, wouldn't he as his boss Srinivasan has ordered him to do so.  Ironic though it may seem, all news channels were seduced into believing that India had put on a world class event.  In reality, it was nothing of the sort.  It was just a tournament.  It could never compare with the English Premier League, or the American Baseball and Football leagues!  In the meantime, characters like Srinivasan continue to wallow in the sewage that is the IPL still thinking that they have brought into India something to be admired!!!
