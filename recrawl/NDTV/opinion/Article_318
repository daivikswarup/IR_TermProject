Headline::::Some in RSS Have Profound Distaste for PM  



DateTime::::2014-12-22T18:21:00+05:30



(The writer is a political columnist, a lapsed historian and a committed conservative.)Since it is the obligation of the parliamentary opposition to oppose, the furore over "Hindu conversions" is understandable. Less understandable may be the complete disruption of the Rajya Sabha, where the NDA Government does not command a majority, and the derailment of important economic legislation. However, recent history has demonstrated that confrontational politics has become the norm for settling political scores. The BJP played that game when it was in opposition for 10 years and the Congress is emulating that dubious example, even if it involves hiding behind the coat-tails of the Trinamool Congress and Left. That the opposition would spare no opportunity to derail the Narendra Modi government's progress was well known. What is perplexing many people is the larger question: why did the BJP present the opportunity such an opening in the first place? Prime Minister Modi made his extreme dissatisfaction with the loose talk of some ministers and backbench MPs quite explicit in his speech to the BJP parliamentary party on December 16. It is understood that the call for restraint also went out to the wider Sangh Parivaar at the same time. Despite this, a section of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has persisted with its more controversial programmes. The reasons for this mismatch between the desires of the government and the activities of some wings of the Parivaar necessitate explanations. Modi is today the acknowledged leader of the wider Parivaar, equalling RSS chief Mohan Rao Bhagwat in stature. Why, it is being asked, is he unable to control the hotheads? For a start, different wings of the wider Hindu parivar operate on the principle of functional autonomy. There may be occasions when the entire family comes together in pursuance of a common objective but on other occasions each unit pursue their autonomous agendas. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, for example, has expressed its opposition to the government's reform initiatives in labour, coal and insurance. Likewise, the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch can be expected to be critical of many facets of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's Budget in 2015. For the VHP, 'ghar vapsi' or the 'homecoming' of erstwhile Hindus is an article of faith. The programme, initially popularised by the late Dilip Singh Judeo in Chhattisgarh, enjoys the backing of a large number of Hindu organisations and religious gurus. Its champions don't see it as 'religious conversion' but an attempt to restore cultural inheritance to individuals and communities who 'strayed' from the ways of their ancestors. This programme is also linked to the demand for a national anti-conversion law that is backed by Hindu organisations in southern India where Christian missionaries have made a mark. For the moment, the VHP leadership may have shelved plans to launch 'ghar vapsi' programmes all over India but the initiative will never be totally abandoned. The retreat is merely tactical and in response to pressures from the Modi government to not do anything to unsettle its economic agenda. Yet, it is a grim reality that neither Modi nor the RSS national leadership is in a position to control every facet of Hindu mobilisation. The RSS, for example, has individuals in high positions who can barely conceal their profound distaste for the Prime Minister. The origins of this hostility date back to Modi's years as Gujarat Chief Minister when, for all practical purposes, he made the VHP irrelevant. There is a feeling in government circles that the present controversies that led to the disruption of Parliament were wilfully triggered by VHP's Dr Pravin Togadia, an individual who has an acrimonious relationship with Modi. In practice, not even the RSS can control all the hotheads. The past two decades have seen the birth of many organisations that have either broken away from the Sangh parivar or have grown independently to wage militant battles on behalf of Hindus. These groups are highly motivated, ideologically driven and often see the BJP (and even the RSS) as an impediment to the self-realisation of India's Hindus. These are also the groups that can easily be manipulated by the BJP's political opponents. There is also a media environment that is conducive to the fringe. It simply requires some 50 individuals, a controversial cause and a few TV cameras to give otherwise irrelevant people notoriety, publicity and even secure political impact. The Hindu Mahasabha, for example, is today merely a letterhead that can be used or misused by anyone. Yet, an outrageous demand by one of its more obscure functionaries to instal a bust of Nathuram Godse made the front pages of many newspapers and was the subject of TV talk shows. The BJP and the Modi Government will have to discover more effective ways of dealing with this Hindu fringe if the disruptions of the Winter session of Parliament isn't going to be carried over into the Budget session.

                            Swapan Dasgupta for your kind information if you say the PM is not capable to control the hindu or Muslim extremism outfit.. It shows his inefficient or ignorance to those organisation . I am a big fan of Modi, but this recent incident making me to re-think of it. I voted modi for development not for Hindutva, if ppl want Hindutva they might given BJP the power in 2009 election itself. People looking for job, less corruption and transform India to superpower,  not for Extremism and hated among the ppl.

                            @swapan dasgupta, Modi got majority by saying that India First, but after election he has proved that RSS first, He said parliament is his temple, but looks at RSS head quarter for all decisions, he and his party men has failed in keeping modi's golden words and taking all along with RSS way its seems that Mohan Bhagwat is the PM of India, and all other sister organisations are ministries with parliament in Nagpur.

                            Let me begin by saying that I support Mr Modi (lest all the bhakts bark at me).Mr swapan, you say that Mr Modi cannot control everyone. That may be true but one is left to ponder that why is it that suddenly all these fringe groups and not so fringe ones like VHP have become active and how they seemed to be dormant when UPA was in power. Certainly, you don't think that the UPA was more efficient than BJP in this aspect. The fact of the matter is that BJP or Mr Modi does not want to upset these groups and does not want to control these groups either. In hindi this is called "doosre ke kandhe pe rakhke bandook chalana"

                            The author wants to convey and fool us all by trying to demarcate Feku and VHP's Hindutva activities. Very nice try indeed! Sorry we are not fools anymore and know the fact very well played by RSS or VHP for that matter which FEKU is an actor and a decision maker. Whatever RSS and VHP does, Feku is their front-man.. Please dont try hard to create a new or an innocent image for Feku!

                            The author tries hard to differentiate our PM with so-called 'fringe elements' and in that process justifies why PM cannot be expected to control all of them. In his eagerness he paints Hindu Mahasabha as a letterpad organization. In reality there is neither fringe nor center. Everyone is playing their part. The need of the hour is to deflect the nation's attention from increasing unemployment, increasing prices despite lowest inflation, manufacturing growth that has tanked, rupee that has gone down south etc.. That's what is going on..

                            This author has vociferously backed Mr Modi's slow but sure ascent to power. Journos like him have been hoping beyond hope that their worst nightmares don't turn out to be true! And that's what is happening. Reconversion mela, Gujarat , Uttar Pradesh, MP and god knows where next. Invectives and abuses by parliamentarians, Gita as the national book, Godse's statues all over! I mean Swapan, which paradise are you living in dude? Modi is just the face of this saffronization which Subramanian swamy openly advocates in his speeches all over! Hindu Renaissance!! I wonder what you have to say about that!

                            Swapan, seriously are you not tired? get well soon. Forget Modi, in your entire article you dare not say that these fringe elements are dangerous to the unity of this country. Fact is politicians always use monsters (RSS/VHP etc etc) to scare others and get to power, with a hope that once in power these monsters can be tamed or sidelined. Unfortunately that's impossible. Please don't play you mind games here, trying to separate Modi/BJP from these monsters, you rode to power on their back.

                            why r u lying? All this is to create public opinion on anti-conversion bill for next session, though proxies like  VHP, which is unfortunately his priority. He is too experienced a politician to know the outcome of such conversion campaign, while the parliament is in motion. He will take the ordinance route for insurance bill.

                            People shall soon start to realise that omissions and commissions of UPA due to coalition compulsions were insignificant when compared with the situation created by the so called fringe elements operating under RSS umbrella or Hindu Mahasabha. Swapan's article doesn't hold water and its sheer baloney. We did not elect BJP to govern us in order to learn Hinduism, on the contrary we voted for BJP so that they shall bring in economic reforms, reduce big ticket corruption and lead India to prosperity.  Performance in the first six months doesn't give much hope and the present BJP government led by Narendra Modi may turn out to be an one term aberration. Voters can be fooled once, twice but not always!

                            It is strongly recommended that Congress and other opposition parties stop their disruptive tactics.  At the same time fringe elements, which are creating an atmosphere of hate  in the country,  must be contained by our PM. It appears that our PM is not affected by these elements untill the industrialists/rich countries ask Modiji to control them.

                            Largely agree with the article but it seems the government is not daring enough to attack on these fringes and also on opposition even after heaving this large majority.<br/><br/>
They are neither taking stand against the fringes nor attacking on the same. If this government decides to take stand on conversions I don't think public will oppose it at large. Only the few liberals and so called sic-u-liars will do some hoha in media.<br/><br/>
And regarding MP/MLA making inappropriate remarks, suspend them all and set a example and in cases where they think the statement made is ok then support the MP/MLA in fullest. currently the government seems to be confused and that's not a very good sign.<br/><br/>
Anyway being a supporter of Mr. Modi, even I think the time has come to perform. Else 6-8 months down the line this government will face tremendous credibility crisis.

                            This almost makes Modi's situation similar to that of his counterpart in Pakistan. Just as Nawaz Sharif pretends that he has no control over the fringe Taliban elements who act illegally, Modi too can claim, directly or indirectly, that he has no control over the dangerous religious polarization that is ruining our Bharat.

                            Why cannot the PM ( and not Narendar Modi or simply an MP from the BJP) put the controversy to rest by stating that it is time India moved away from the politics of religion and caste? The simple truth is that the PM by not taking a stance , has kept the option open for his party cadres and mentor organizations to raise the pitch for majoritarian religious politics. Let no one be in any doubt despite obfuscations to the contrary by Dasguta that the BJP's ideology flows from the ideology of the RSS and the VHP.

                            Missing the POINT in the storm of the dust that SEEMS to cloud popularity of India's Smraatt,especially amongst the educated middle classes.The point is, through the storms of 'Hindu controversies', A CHANGE IN THE PSYCHE OF HINDUS IS HAPPENING, Hindus are SUBCONSCIOUSLY turning into ACTIVE DOERS from being OPPRESSED RECEIVERS for centuries. That is the greater plan, that is what is being done and it will continue. In next few years the basic psyche of Hindus will change,they will no longer accept being kicked for their religion,they will not accept being treated like second class citizens in their own country, that awakened Hindu psyche will form the basis of our King's appeal when this dust would appeared to have been settled.

                            Hindu organizations should first put their own house in order before planning to induct people from other religions.The temples are dirty, and except a few most are in a bad state, are badly managed, and no one is there to help underprivileged hindus and tribals.The rich and the people with money get to have 'special' darshans of the idols, whether it is Vaishno Mata or is Tirupati or is Kurukhetra or Haridwar.We should take a lesson fom Sikh gurdwaras which are so well managed and sikh community taking so good care of each other.VHP and HJM should concentrate on helping ther own community and hindu places of worship.

                            The PM's work is cut out. He knows nothing will pass through RS....given that the dolts are in majority till 2016. So, he has to get a majority in RS by then...and that is possible only through state elections. People are not fools, and you know it better than anyone, Swapan! You know that the minute these conversion and religious rows break out, people who voted for the BJP fume as to why it is allowing the VHP etc to dictate terms (by the way, VHP is different from the RSS. VHP is the one trying to do the conversion etc. RSS's agenda is totally different). But, before the BJP loyalists can even begin to criticize the PM and his party...the debates begin. We are again exposed to the two timing, two faced secular parties barking on and on about conversions INTO hinduism, but never OUT OF hinduism. And then the loyalists understand, Swapan. We know that the PM is making sure Indians who are going to vote during the State elections can see that the secularists are still hard at work...to drown India and make it chaotic. So, we keep quiet. We watch the debates and watch the secularists dig holes deeper and deeper. And when the state elections come...we go and vote. We know now, that the LS was just the start. We need to give the BJP a majority in the RS as well. So, if the PM is keeping quiet, he is smarter than you and I put together ;) Jai HInd! And may the BJP get victory today in Jharkand, and get primary opposition role in J&amp;K. And yes, that will increase their seat share in RS in 2016, when a large chunk of members will resign. Jai Bharat!

                            I have always believed that Goebbelite traits prevails in Swapan. His article smacks of frustration. Is it because it is somebody whom you worship is the PM that the opposition should give up opposing? Throughout UPA I's time, BJP did everything that they could to disrupt the functioning of the Parliament. But that did not bring them to power in 2009. The frustration had peaked by then for Swapan and his likes. Then RSS was influenced to back Modi. Protests of Advani etc were just dumped. Then the Varanasi seat fiasco where again the RSS was made to prevail. In 2014, they managed to get the numbers by exploiting (if not misusing) the (mis)information technology. All that is fine and we are all game to it. OK, they won and Congress lost â perhaps more for the larger than life image depicted of Modi and pygmying Rahul. The media did their best. Rajat Gupta and Arnab Goswami are examples. <br/><br/>
Reading between the lines, the labyrinths of the mind stumbles upon what he really means "Yes, you RSS, Hindu Mahasabha, Godse followers, please listen, NaMo image is of greater stature than all of you put together. So please SHUTUP. Your existence is only virtual is Namo is not real." But Swapan cannot even hint at it. He fears being ostracized by RSS and lose his job of the propaganda chief â leaving him to contribute freelance articles for peanuts for meager readership and party mouth pieces. Maybe he may even face the same fate of Nikolai Yezhow but in a milder scale â courtesy the democracy that still prevails in this country.<br/><br/>
Coming back to NaMo and the RSS, let there be a rejoinder from any one of the two referred in the so called "acrimonious relationship" with Modi and the RSS (or by Togadia or Bhagwat). If not, Swapan please do not point fingers and project effigies and scapegoats (like RSS, Hindu Mahasabha, etc.) by stating "scoring political points", BJP's presenting the opportunity or blatantly avoiding to underscore that Modi would make the VHP irrelevant even nationally as Swapan himself reports Modi having done so in Gujarat. People will much like Modi, RSS and of course Swapan to come clean! Swapan perhaps has a short memory and does not want to bring reference to the BJP's manifesto released days before the Lok Sabha elections amidst a great deal of grandeur and ostentatious display much like the minority pervert body builders rather than unlike the proud power builders and to just remind him of the Temple building which was argued to be only a passing message in the handbook.<br/><br/>
The need of the hour is to be pragmatic, sincere and fearless but be accountable to the voters especially the youth (who have been the latgest contributors) who brought BJP to power. Otherwise it will be another TMC show with regrets of what was the reason for the âbodol' â only âbadla'. So don't show your frustration. Don't wait for your numbers in the Rajya Sabha to swell. Get your act together. The year is almost over! Greeting for the New Year.

                            In India religious conversions are legal.  It had been and still is happening.  Most of the time, it is Hindus converted to Islam or Christianity and nobody cares.  Modi has no right to tell VHP or RSS not to bring back Hindus who had crossed the border and became non Hindus.  Modiji is showing his weakness to the opposition by asking VHP to stop conversions while Christians and Muslims can carry on as they like.  This means opposition will use this tactics every time they want something.  Looks like Modi is not as tough as we thought.

                            Why the secular parties don't discuss &amp; debate the conversion of tribals to Christianity in Bihar? why not discuss the huge inflow of foreign money to missionaries for conversion purposes in India? I am no fan of VHP &amp; RSS and quite frankly feel they need to shut up &amp; let the govt develop the country. The whole Rajya sabha debate would have made sense if the parties openly discussed conversions of Hindu's as well. Instead whenever anyone raises the topic of missionary conversions the secular parties say it's against constitution as everyone has right to promote their religion. Why then do RSS &amp; VHP don't have that right? Telling someone his diseases will get cured if he converts to christianity is also conversion by influence but I didn't see a single secular party condemn or protest against that. The entire anti-conversion debate has pushed the secular parties into a corner exposing their hypcrisy &amp; double speak.<br/><br/>
As for Modi, the constant heat on conversions despite his private protests are worrying. So is his silence against these elements in RSS &amp; VHP. As someone who voted for Modi (mind you I voted for Modi not BJP) I am feeling worried about his silence to publicly take on these people. Maybe what's needed is for him to politely tell them to shut up on his 'Mann ki Baat' radio speech. Though I am worried, Iam willing to give Modi more time. Even in Gujarat when Modi took over as CM in 2002, VHP &amp; Togadia were all powerfull. By 2007 neither of them were anywhere to be seen. I hope by 2017 the RSS, VHP &amp; Togadia types will be outdated &amp; pushed out of media &amp; the country can move towards development.

                            Unless Modi keeps parivar on leash, BJP is going to see its worst poll debacle any ruling party ever had.

                            P.v.Narasimha Rao heading a minority Government, with no support from his own party, with media abusing him day in and day out, with no mass support managed to pass historic legislations which fundamentally changed the very structure of our policy making.  It looks India failed to recognise a bundle of talent called, PVNR.

                            Productivity provides a good indication of the functioning of the 2 houses. The issues need to be categorised and prioritised. There is no point in mixing up issues and throwing mud and not allowing the institution complete important business. The appraisal system will ensure performance will be measured and will ensure that due consideration is given to category and priority of business.

                            It is wrong to suggest that Modi came to power on the plank of either Development or Hindutva alone. Development alone would not have enthused the BJP cadre. Hindutva alone would not have brought the new incremental vote. It was a potent and heady mixture of both. And thus, the shift of focus from one to another will be tactical and not strategic. Neglecting any of the two would be a betrayal.

                            Prime Minister should go-ahead with his development agenda because he holding the treasury, the opposition behave childish and ruling party president should answer for their political question.
