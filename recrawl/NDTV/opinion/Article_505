Headline::::AAP is Ready to Lose the Old And Move On



DateTime::::2015-04-14T14:21:00+05:30



(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)
Long ago when the crisis in AAP had just erupted, I had tweeted, that "It's a clash of ideas, it's a clash between ultra leftism and the new idea of welfarism." Very recently, I was once again asked by a very senior and respected journalist "What is the ideology of the party?" The occasion was the launch of my book - The Crown Prince, The Gladiator and The Hope. Arvind Kejriwal was there on the dais. This is a question all of us have been asked over and over again since the inception of the party. And a section of the intellectual class wants the whole world to believe that AAP can't be taken seriously, as it does not have a coherent ideology; these gentlemen would like to rubbish us as a short-term phenomenon whose longevity can't be predicted, as only those whose existence is backed by a strictly-defined ideology can boast of sustainability.
This question will resonate even more in coming days as the so called "ideological Godfathers" of the party are trying to carve a separate path for themselves. The genesis of this question goes back to the intellectual class whose discourse has been dominated by left-wing thinking. Their softer variant, socialism, has also contributed its bit in this endeavor. The communist manifesto was probably the first coherent ideological document which tried to answer every question of social-political-relevance; Left ideologies dominated the world discourse for a very long time, and helped capitalism reform and evolve with a human face. But just like a tragedy, the Left degenerated into an ideology which completely discarded the human as a unit of the universe. Human rights had no recognition, liberty and freedom of mind and soul was robbed in the name of communist party. No wonder by the end of 20th century, the Left evaporated from the global mind space and those who survived are today practicing capitalism in the garb of communism. In China, Leftism is only in name. Even Mao has been banished from the party document.
In India, the Left as a political force was always a fringe player, confined to one or two states. Socialism was of course was very powerful at one given point of time. Socialists were the second-largest force after the Congress during the first parliamentary elections. But lack of discipline, egotism of its leaders and impatience, and no desire to work on the party structures led the socialist movement adrift and made it disintegrate. Though its remnants still exist, now it would be a crime to even call them socialists.  All of them have turned into private limited companies with the ilk of Mulayam and Lalu Yadav as their exponents. This was the same socialist movement which had given the concepts of "anti-Congressism and backward politics" which weakened the Congress. But in the 21st century, both Leftism and Socialism have lost value for the new generation, as they failed to change themselves with the changing realities.
Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav represent leftism and socialism in their own ways in the same order. Since they were perceived as architects of the ideological edifice of the party, AAP was treated by the intellectual class as a party with new ideas, but burdened with the baggage of the past. It was viewed as a party which is anti-development and does not believe in the holistic economic growth of the country. AAP's victory gave the Sensex and big industry big heart attacks. AAP was ridiculed as a party that promoted a subsidy economy.  Arvind has said so many times that AAP believes in the market economy, it believes that the government has no business to be doing business, and can at best act as a facilitator. It believes that unless the government helps create an environment in which the entrepreneur can unleash his energy, there is no future for the country. But time and time again, his voice has been drowned in the larger misplaced perception about the party that it adheres to outdated ideologies and promotes old ideas.
The world has changed a lot in the last few decades. Ideology has given way to new aspirations, shaped by technology which offers the  eternal freedom to communicate. Today there is hardly any difference between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party in the USA, and the same applies to the Tories and the Labour in the UK. Except for the minority policy, no discernible difference can be detected in the Congress and the BJP. In fact the Modi government looks like an extension of the Manmohan Singh regime. There is hardly any difference in their policy formulations. For the global citizens, what matters is delivery. Nobody understood it better than Deng Xiaoping, the supreme leader of China.  He used to say, "It does not matter if cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice."  Don't forget that he was the original revolutionary along with Mao who once had said in 1974, "I have never attended a university but I have always considered that since the day I was born, I have been in the University of Life." The romantic revolutionary of 1949 was a realist in 1979 when he took the reigns of the party and the rest, as they say, is history.
The present crisis in AAP is an opportunity to get rid of  misplaced perceptions. This is an opportunity to reposition AAP as a brand. AAP's great attraction lies in its fight against corruption and the hope of millions that AAP will make the system transparent and accountable. If AAP gets imprisoned in any particular "ism", then it will be the death of the idea which has made AAP so popular and which has brought a paradigm shift in Indian polity. So let's get rid of the OLD and rediscover the NEW.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            You are a sickening creature who is trying to destroy what others have created. And you are calling those creators "old" - the life line of the party you are saying you are ready to move on without them? Who exactly are you?? What is your claim to authority of this party and all the work that so many have done? How dare you take ownership of so many peoples efforts and speak for all - who gives you the right?? Just bcoz you get space to write nonsense that does not give you authority and right over so many peoples efforts and the authority to dictate and be simply horrible.

                            A desperate attempt by Ashutosh to justify the wrong doings of KAAP (Kejriwal's AAP) which is functioning like KHAP. Ashutosh seems to be pushing the message that results is what matter and not the means to get there. There are many murderers, rapists and corrupt who get elected democratically. They do not win elections by rigging or booth capturing etc - they win via popular vote. This means there are people who are happy with them and might be benefitting. Does that mean we can allow these kind of people to keep winning? Principles do matter - don't confuse principles with "isms"

                            Not able to understand what he is trying to say. Will be surprised if he really knows what he is trying to say. What I interpret from this is that he says everyone is the same and it is down to who delivers better. And this is the first time I have heard them speak this way, which seems to be an echo of what Modi was saying all along, it is about who delivers better. Effectively, they spoke all sorts of different things in the AAP to come to power, and now they are down to delivery. Good for Delhi if they can do that. And good for AAP that they have come to the realization that they are no different in the thought process to the BJP. On the actions, though, they are different. So far they have just doled out freebies on electricity, water and to some suffering farmers in Delhi, although i don't know how much farming happens in Delhi.

The heart of the matter is - there can be nothing as 'honest politics' in this country.Because whenever an honest idea brings forth, opportunists like you jump in to reap the benefits.

1. Ashutosh introduction states his achievement is floosing against 2 big politician. Unbelievable. Arvind will now include succesfully loosing against Modi in Varanasi as achievement. Anyway not Ashutosh fault poor guy does not have much achievement to show.<br/>
2. He then bore audience with socialism crap, just to make a point that prasant bhusan and yogendra are leftist and socialist people.<br/>
3. He states there is no difference left in parties all over the world and AAP is also changing to be one of them.<br/>
4. STEALS the MODI's line goverment has no buisness in being in buisness. Really you got to steal ideas.<br/>
Ashutosh is brilliant comedy writter, his article makes me realise people whom i would have consider stupid are far more intelligent than you know who...

                            Everytime Ashutosh opens his mouth, AAP loses 5000 votes. But jokes apart, Mr. Ashutosh, please note that Leftism &amp; Socialism are mere ideas. And ideas are never bad. It's the implementation that makes or mar them. Whatever 'isms' your party is indulging in, opportunism being one of them, it looks like you are heading in the same direction.<br/><br/>
Mr. PB &amp; Mr. Yadav could have hurt your party the most by going against you publicly BEFORE the elections. But they didn't do that. And if you knew they were 'dismantling' the party, why didn't you write about it BEFORE the elections? Your's is the party that believed in swearing-in in front of the whole nation @ the open grounds of Ram lila maidan. But when it came up to debates on party ethics, not one person was allowed to participate.<br/><br/>
The only thing that hurts me is that you'll look at all these comments. Take a sip of tea. Smile. And carry on.

Well done - you are nothing short of a mad criminal character - murdering not a person, but an idea and a party born with so much hard work and efforts of so so many. Who gives you the right to take it over and decide the do away with the old - which is actually good and gold - ethics, non violent behaviour, respect? All thrown out of the window by you. Who gave you this right??

                            Now that AAP looks more cohesive and collected with young leadership. It is a golden opportunity for Arvind to change the processes and systems in the Delhi government over next few years and create a model for the rest of the country. And Arvind should update his knowledge base simultaneously in defense, global business and security issues of India(a global player) for 2019 Lok Sabha elections. It is going to be more of a presidential form elections.

New - no mobile cameras at meetings, no opportunity to speak and put another view point forward, shady candidates being given tickets and the Lokpal virtually threatened into deciding in no time about their candidature, violence as a means of confronting differing view points/ opponents.

                            Mr. Ashutosh, you are either horribly confused or are deliberately  trying to justify (under orders of AK, who else!) the indefensible.<br/><br/>
You ( and your group, some call it coterie) have to devise new arguments from time to time to defend your criticism of PB and YY et al ,and then expulsion from various bodies and probably future expulsion.<br/><br/>
Initially , your argument was ultra leftist group has difference with pragmatic group. Then came the argument that it is nothing but jealousy of PB &amp; YY duo with AK. Now , you have tried to give it a colour of inevitability, historical necessity and uselessness of idealism. <br/><br/>
I think you have forgotten, Mr. Ashutosh, idealogues and mentors are never called 'Kamine' , anywhere in India. Such epithets were copyrighted by AAP.<br/><br/>
Such shifting arguments show that there is something to hide by you and your group including AK.<br/><br/>
I tell you what you are trying to hide. Having tasted a sense of   power ( from the last elections itself), your group became desperate to 'enjoy' power at any cost. You were ready to even barter the soul of AAP at the alter of 'satta bhog'. Form here onwards, began the game of keeping the conscience keepers out of the scheme . Devising new new excuses began your favourite pastime .  First you tried to humiliate them so that they quietly go away. When that failed , you tried to trick  them by cajoling them to  resign. When they saw through your game and refused to do your bidding, you got frustrated . You started ' kamine' campaign, started bullying them, and became vicious. <br/><br/>
Mr Ashutosh, you and your group  have already killed the spirit of AAP. It was the soul which whole country looked upto, not a bunch of loud mouthed street singers who tom tom tupence homilies hoping people will foolishly believe in the purity of your intentions .A Big joke!<br/><br/>
What you and your AK have  done is a great betrayal with the expectation of people. And remember, people of this country forgive many things , but not the betrayal. <br/>
You have already lost!! and lost it badly and too quickly!

                            I think Ashutosh is trying to divert the attention from issues within the AAP by projecting it as Socialist vs Capitalist. While justifying capitalism, he shouldn't forget that providing huge subsidies on utilities (what they are doing in Delhi) is also considered part of socialism. People are not blind, they understand what is going on.

                            YY and PB are doing Swaraj Samwad in an open manner. Media is allowed, cameras are allowed. They have no fear -- because they speak the truth. At least have the courage to appreciate what is being done right, Mr. Ashutosh!

                            Ashutosh repeatedly shows a lack of understanding of issues and political phenomenon. To say that there is little difference between BJP and Congress, Tories and labour, Republicans and democrats in terms of their ideology shows the lower IQ of The Ashutosh and the AAP goons in general. I wonder what this thinking in AAP would have done to our foreign policy if AK-49 had become the PM of India by some quirk of fate. Thankfully the prospect of that happening is non-existent now. The ideology of AK-AAP is anarchy which is a natural progression of leftist thought. All political parties in the world are founded on an ideology and these typically are inclined to either the left or right wing thinking. Communism has been dis-credited the world over and left oriented politics had to adapt to survive. Labour became new labour under Tony Blair and was successful till he aligned with Bush in US and participated in the Iraq war, thus loosing the political goodwill that he had gathered. God save us from these low IQ goons who are now ruling Delhi.

                            Why is it that whenever he or anyone from AAP write about the party, they insist there are more than just a 'get rid of corruption' party. But they never, never spell out their fiscal plans. Other than to say this and that will be given free.

                            In the beginning of the blog he himself asks the question about the ideology of the party. I read each line thinking the next one would surely have that answer in a clearly defined way. But alas Ashutosh all you have done is point out faults of others and the normal banter which makes no sense. But having read the last few lines I can truly say (and you should adapt it as a resolution) "The ideology of AAP is to protect Kejriwal at all costs no matter how low he stoops and that only the "chamchas" of Kejriwal like Ashutosh &amp; Vishwas ( the most non-original so called poet/artist) will survive in AAP. 5 years will pass soon Ashutosh and then you will face the wrath of the people and I am sure Delhi will not commit the same blunder twice. Stop the arrogance please.

                            Ashutosh, when you had a movement you wanted the welfare of the people (socialist movement), uplifting the aspiration or faith that was evolved from the leftest ideas across the world was needed and when you got into power, you wanted a capitalist idea. Is this Aam Aadmi style. The concept of ideology was to move forward in the middle path with leftest idea to bring the less accessed person, with a rightest views of development, ruling with equality and democratic values that will see the development of every citizens. Aushutosh, you have the same style of sitting in the studio... you have not moved beyond stage to the ground level to understand the value...

This was not a fight for a state or individuals but it was a fight of the strong voice against the few opportunist all over the country. You guys had misused the voice and i can now predict that AAP will also be the same private limited party.<br/><br/>
Ashutosh, you should look back in your own careerer. Where you was earlier and what now you are. I am not your party volunteer or even member, so don't conclude that this is just propaganda war. I am a real voter who will not vote you any more.

                            That's very well Mr. Ashutosh if you feel AAP neither needs ideology nor any ideological foundation. Present leadership of AAP seems to believe Good governance and delivery is everything that matters. Will you then please explain your rhetoric of pre-election days about Lokpal, Swaraj, intra-party democracy, transparency etc ? What has happened to alternative politics that AAP promised to bring in place of today's substitute politics ? So, those were only slogan for vote catching ? In the name of removing old and banishing -ism - you are compromising you are compromising basic values on which AAP was formed. The values that differentiated AAP from any other party. If good governance is everything that matters - what way you are different fro BJP or Congress ?  Should we only believe in Kejriwal's niyat or see some concrete institutional mechanism that will keep AAP clean in days to come. What guarantee is there that kejriwal will not become another Mamta Banerjee in 5 years ?  Or we dumb public have to believe whatever crap leaders like Ashutosh peddle ?

You have admitted that ideology about AAP was only to make it attractive for winning elections. Once elections were won, your group wants to enjoy the power and wealth for power's sake . Ideology (and thus ideologues) be damned. Yes , you have indirectly admitted that AK &amp; his group had plans to expel these ideologues from the beginning , irrespective of anything. The excuses you built up were supposed to fabricated anyway. Good , that , you have admitted it ..

                            What mr Ashutosh say look good. But i hope There will not be another fight inside the party. <br/><br/>
If the party becomes stable now with kejriwal at centre point. Then sure AAP is unstoppable. All other parties knows this! One honest man with good intentions can change the country even if he works like a dictator.

                            One of Asuthosh's frequent quotes is: "The only charges against Kejriwal are that he is dictatorial,a high-handed supremo, but has anyone accused him of financial fraud, misappropriation, theft etc.?". In Ashutosh's view only theft is a human failing and speaking lies through your teeth is perfectly alright, otherwise why would the National Council meeting held on 28/03/2015 presided over by Kejriwal ban video recording of the proceedings (there was only a camera view of the stage) and the presence of an independent observer as demanded by  the rebel group?

                            Good Logic..but MREGA is still on my friend. Write to the hundreds of rural folk subsisting off it and we will see what their reaction is. Capitalists are elitists. Look at USA...recession, prostitution, pornography, alcoholism, drugs and broken families. You need more than just Big houses and cars to make a society

                            In your article we understood what BY stood for collectively. They had an ideology which at least coherent thinking. What we did not understand from your so called article is what is AAP ideology. Your superlative adjective of comparing hope of millions with AK is misplaced one. He has not proved anything different from BJP or Congress MP/MLAs. Infact he exhibited for the power he can break his own home and support bootlickers in the party. That is what he exhibited in addition to compromising on ethos to remain clean. Your MLAs have started making rounds. It will not be very long that their personal wealth will rapidly raise like in the case of Mr. Vadra. You too will do very well for next 5 years and will be blessed with prosperity. In btw, only people will feel left out is 100 of volunteer and young folks who trusted their destiny with manipulator like AK and company.  Never forget that we will have a chance of voting again

                            With due respect to your developed knowledge , there is difference between republicans and democrats in terms public expenditure , social welfare and labour relations.What YY and PB asked was something you have been demanding from others , but cant provide yourselves .That you continued to pursue Congress after quitting is power greediness to say least.Unfortunately , people of delhi have suffered massive government damage due to immaturity.Now you are going to be foxed by every institution around you

                            So according to Ashutosh, AAP is going to discover a "new" more pragmatic political philosphy or stay non-committal to existing political philosophies.  That is fine by me, by how is this different from what PB or YY believes? YY may have a "Leftist" leaning, like how Kejriwal has a leaning towards "dharna" politics or Modi has a leaning towards the cooperative world, but he is a not "absolutist", just like the others. PB's views of economics, is pretty pragmatic and flexible, atleast from what I have read about him. So where exactly is the "conflict"? To see Ashutosh talking about the OLD and NEW, like as though this is a 50 year old party with a historically coherent political identity is laughable. For someone, who came into the AAP just a year after YY, he seems oblivious to the fact that he is very much the OLD AAP(at least according to his own definition). I wish Ashutosh would explain to the volunteers how "removing" dissenters will help AAP discover this "new" political philosophy. How can the AAP discover anything, if they can't discussion issues among themselves and generate consensus? Lets call a spade a spade, shall we? Kejriwal finds the party too unwieldy because of the dissenting opinions and multiple centers of power. He wants to simplify things by consolidating power under him. Don't polish-the-turd by reframing it as a "NEW" political philosophy. The new philosophy is essentially KEJRIWALISM.
