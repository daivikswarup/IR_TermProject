Headline::::Why Kejriwal Will Not Ask Bihar To Vote For Nitish



DateTime::::2015-08-28T16:38:00+05:30




                                There is no denying the fact that Arvind Kejriwal and Nitish Kumar are extremely fond of each other. The body language of the two at recent meetings has conveyed a lot more than it concealed. But it is also true that this relationship is born out of the extra-ordinary times that AAP and the country is living in. These are not normal times. The forefathers of the idea of India would never have thought that there would one day be a majority government of the RSS at the centre.
The RSS by its DNA is not democratic. It does not believe in unity-in-diversity, which is not only the cultural construct in the Indian context but also the Nehruvian notion of federalism. It does not believe in diverse sub-nations within one nation. For the RSS, India is one nation - a Hindu nation - and diversity weakens that notion. It is for this reason that the RSS never accepts other minorities as separate cultural-religious entities; rather, it advocates that all of them are several offshoots of the main branch that is Hinduism and to create a Hindu Rashtra is to correct "historical mistakes" and to mitigate the "weaknesses" which have crept in the body and soul of India and which in their opinion are the fundamental reason for the colonial rule for centuries. Modern historians categorise British rule as colonial rule, but the RSS paints the entire medieval era as colonial. Modi's tendency of the centralization of power and his advocacy of a strong centre is the product of the RSS's vision and version of a strong Hindu nation.
The 2014 parliamentary elections provided the moment that the RSS has been waiting for since its inception in 1925. Their main opponent, the Congress party, was hugely discredited and its leadership had never appeared as weak. But this was also the time when a phenomenon called Arvind Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to the fore and stood in the path of that grand "project" which the RSS had cherished for so long. Starting December 2013 and till mid- February 2014, Arvind Kejriwal eclipsed the rising star and the hope of new India, Narendra Modi. The media was going gaga over Kejriwal and newspapers were terming the AAP victory a "revolution". I have been told this when Modi panicked and thought that he would not be able to fulfill his ambition to be Prime Minister.
But Kejriwal resigned, and, as the cliche goes - "the rest is history". Even after his resignation, Kejriwal's decision to contest the elections against Modi in Varanasi and the entire narrative of the campaign being anti-Modi and anti- RSS convinced Modi and the RSS leadership that this new political force might jeopardize their plans. AAP has the potential to create an existential crisis for the RSS. The consistent and vitriolic attack on AAP and its government in Delhi should be viewed in this context. AAP believes that the idea of RSS is fascist in its very nature and dangerous for the unity of the India. It is the historical responsibility of AAP and Kejriwal to educate the people of India about the true intent of Modi and the RSS's agenda.
The tremendous loss faced by Modi and the BJP in Delhi in December's state election has diminished the aura of invincibility which he had acquired after winning many consecutive assembly elections. If he loses Bihar, his stature will be reduced to that of any other top grade political leader. He will be one among equals. His charm and the alleged allure of the RSS ideology to the middle class will get a severe beating. It is incumbent on all the modern-secular-liberal-democratic forces who believe in "unity-in-diversity" to contribute their bit and defeat the forces of fascism.
AAP is a historic movement. It has a historic responsibility. Its agenda is to build a new India, a modern-secular-liberal-democratic India. Those who think that AAP is going to forge a political alliance with Nitish and Kejriwal asking for votes for him, are living in a fool's paradise. AAP will not compromise with its ideals. AAP right now is a small political party, but it has a national appeal. Its endeavour is to convert its national appeal into a national alternative, and for this we have to build a robust organisation in every state including Bihar. We know that the RSS will spread rumours and propaganda, but I want to clear five things that will guide our role during the Bihar assembly elections.
1. AAP believes that Modi/RSS is dangerous for the country and should be defeated.
2. AAP will not enter any kind of alliance with any political party or leader including Nitish Kumar.
3. AAP will not ask voters to vote for any party or individual including Nitish Kumar.
4. AAP and its leaders, including Kejriwal, will not campaign for or share any dais for electoral purposes with any other party.
5. If Kejriwal is called as a Chief Minister for any official function, then courtesies and formal niceties will be performed.
 
Beyond this nothing should be read between the affection and interaction of the two leaders. Being in a different political party does not mean political entities should not meet or interact with each other, but this interaction should not be construed as any kind of compromise with the idea or ideology to which one adheres. We should also not lose the sense of history and history demands that AAP should play its historical role in Bihar and AAP will not shy away from its responsibility.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            whom are u trying to fool, aushutosh? Everyone knows that kejriwal and Nitish Kumar are opportunists, and this mutual back scratching is based purely on political interests. As far as the RSS issue is concerned this tale is nothing new and this excuse has been used by all political parties for unholy alliances. The fact is is that the selfless work done by RSS, whether during calamities or for nation building is unparalleled in the history of independent India and the people have begun to recognise it. Time u dropped this hypocrisy of "extraordinary circumstances"!!

Ashutosh, when you say Indians are fools to have selected BJP, you should know those fools have also selected you. And to say the entire India was a fool to select BJP, is so kiddish and personally outrageous. I don't need a common sense certificate from a power hungry double standard cheap politician who has a habit of crying &amp; blaming others for everything.

For your information RSS has sustained all the crisis for last several decades instead all odds and thriving. Your AAP is just beginning and you have to prove your worth. Just opening mouth and speaking to say something is not good.

Why the hell you are debating on that. You have become anti BJP anti Modi Anti RSS and stopped working on Anti corrutption. For Anti BJP-RSS-MODI we already have congress in place, then why the hell we need you?<br/>
You guys either deviated from the cause OR you are now on your right path but fools like me took so long to understand.

1. If not voting for BJP then you are voting for Nitish+LALU+Congress alliance<br/>
2. LALU is a convict in BRIBERY case<br/>
3. LALU raj is also considered as Jungle RAJ<br/>
4. In past Congress has also scared people by saying "Modi aa Jayega"<br/>
5. Arvind Kejriwal and his Crap party is obsessed with so called Kejriwal phenomenon

                            From my reading of history, RSS was conceived in 1925 after communal clashes in post khilafat movement times.They pride themselves to be a neutralizing force against powers that they deemed anti national. As much I believe that we need not ask anyone to prove their allegiance to india, I believe there has been increased radicalism in communities that live in ghettos ,perhaps out of insecurity or sheer poverty.If we keep pointing the finger at RSS and not address the growing ghetto culture and herd mentality, I believe we are in for more messy times...I would hate to see owaisi brothers turn out to be tomorrow's Ali brothers and kejriwal the Gandhi.and yea,Non violence is too overrated...its important to be savage in body BUT civilized in mind

                            Thank you Aashutosh. Hope you are aware 'little knowledge is very dangerous' this applies to you. But one good point you were consistent throughout your article was 'AAP &amp; Kejriwal' finally accepting they both are two different things.  Kejriwal was part of a moment of which AAP was outcome, and now Kejriwal and his friends like you want to crush the democracy within AAP and have it all Kejriwal way. AK wants to be politically correct that he never asked anyone to vote for Nitish. But the way he is displaying is affection for Nitish &amp; Lalu implies he is fond of JDU &amp; RJD combine and JDU+RJD+Congress to be in power. AK is successfully converting AAP into any other political party.

                            Instead of playing historical role AAP will become history if Kejri continue with his gimmics rather than governance.  Governments have come and gone but never India has witnessed such bitterness between state and central govt as is seen today with AAP at power at Delhi. Why others can get along irrespective of party in power in state and centre but not AAP is because of its over ambition to rule India without having any presence in many states. Modi came to Delhi after serving Gujrat for more than a decade. Initially he silently worked for the state proved himself and then got into national politics. Let Kejri do the same. Silent work is more recognised rather than self boasting

                            Kejriwal and team had that amount of Money, Time and Labour to go to Bihar specially to benefit the most corrupt minister in our country. This clearly shows the intentions of Kejriwal. There are so many problems in Delhi at the moment, plus the Jan Lokpal bill, no wonder he still finds time to go to Bihar and gain political benefits. This is sheer politics and time for AAP supporters to change their mind. This guys a cheat and opportunist.

For what they are dangerous please clarify.<br/>
The whole of the country has voted for its own  danger. Seems illogical.<br/>
Recently they have won the local elections in MP, Rajasthan and Bangalore.<br/>
Why are the people continuing to vote for danger for the country.<br/>
Please give solid reasons, just not the excuse.<br/><br/>
But people have realized what kind of people are you. <br/><br/>
Why AAP will not support Nitish Kumar?<br/><br/>
You can address the rally with him.  Still you are not supporting Nitish. Whom are you trying to befool.

                            Even being anti BJP-CONGRESS I don't read the lengthy essays of Ashutosh. His role in sidelining YY and PB was game changer. So ask someone better to write.

                            Dear Ashutosh,<br/><br/>
Bad Article...because it is based on bad logic. Kejriwal has already promoted Nitish Kumar as much as he could have and he need not do anything more - so please don't make rotten statements like AAP will not ask for votes for Nitish. Oh....but just a minute, Kejriwal actually asked the biharis in Delhi to ensure victory for Nitish - I guess this happened when Nitish was visiting Delhi last time and Arvind Kejriwal met him for some public function.  <br/><br/>
Now, in Kejriwal aligning himself with Nitish, I assume there is nothing outrageously wrong, except that indirectly Lalu Yadav too gets promoted. It was perhaps political pragmatism for Kejriwal to support Nitish - but why the hell do you have to fall back upon the pathetic and oft-abused argument that it is every one's duty to defeat RSS and Modi as they are not secular. It brings back the memory of opportunistic and corrupt leaders taking this argument to forge convenient political alignments. Let me tell you, Arvind Kejriwal, of all the politicians, has in the past and will again in the future not be ashamed of benefiting from RSS support.<br/><br/>
Finally, this could have been an important moment in history and AAP could have been a historic player and there could have been a historic opportunity. But all of this is lost and squandered by the very way, Arvind Kejriwal and many of you acted and compromised on values. Please ask any person including an AAP supporter - AAP today draws no support on the basis of its moral strength. Also, It no more suits AAP to talk of democratic values - you know why. While I don't have the far sightedness to write, nor do I wish that it turns out to be true, but the fact is AAP might already have ensured that its story starts and ends in Delhi.

                            @AAPHole: HaHa, I love this guy, he always somehow manages to make me laugh with his comments and observations, a new Lalu of Indian politics just Like Kejriwal a new Indira Gandhi of Indian politics and AAP a new Congress of Indian Politics. I sometimes use to think, the initial allegation that AAP is Congress Team B is really true? There are enough reasons to believe that now, all the congress opportunists who now realize there is nothing left in Gandhi family can shift to Kejriwal family now.

You want defeat of BJP, but did not utter much about the so called Governance of Nitish. Is that because you are still figuring out how to Govern Delhi? You give more advertisement to RSS and in fact will help it grow. You guys talk too much. Please Govern and show us some light.

I believe that the people who do not respect people's judgement are un-democratic. There is no need to call BJP un-democratic. Give a solid prrof of saying so.<br/>

                            This is why I never trust AAP. How conveniently they change objective of their political fight. Earlier it was congress which needed to be defeated to save nation so they started lol pal movement. Then they fixed eyes on pm post and resigned in Delhi. They saw modi wave so started fighting against modi in Varanasi for publicity. Thereafter now they joined hands with congress lalu and nitish and making excuse that their fight is against communalism so rss must be defeated. Where is your original anti corruption movement gone which you told everyone for coming into politics. You resigned in Delhi coz of lokpal but where is it after you got 67 mla. You must be thinking people are fool after winning Delhi by 67 seats but people have seen your true color. All of sudden it is modi your prime target.

                            Dear Ashutosh, good points raised. I want to add.<br/>
1. Modi/RSS coming to power is one off incidence. Sanity will prevail.<br/>
2. Ten years anti incumbency combined with reluctance to accept candidature of Prime Ministership made things easy for Modi as he was more than desperate for Prime Ministership ( of course with support of RSS backed machinery of volunteers) and public liked it.<br/>
3. Secular is character of India/majority. Therefore, in next election fight will be in between unified secular opposition and  communal B.J.P. . <br/>
4.  If unified opposition puts  their act together , the evil will be rooted out and wrongs will be set right.<br/>
Kejrival and Niteesh's coming together is just beginning  .By the time of next general election, Modi will face united apposition.<br/>
So beware of  inevitable.

The content of the article barely touches the details needed for the heading. 90% of the article talks about the issues with the central government and the rest of 10% is covered in 5 bullet points. I was a supporter of AAP but the way Kejriwal has been indulging with Nitish Kumar is worrying. AAP has become just like any other party. Opportunistic and power mongering.

Regardless of how the media has portrayed you, I saw first hand that Delhi residents are very happy with the government in Delhi. This is heartening and encouraging. I also visited Varanasi in the same visit: people there have vowed to never vote for Modi again.<br/><br/>
Thank you for exposing the true designs of the RSS: a party that killed Bapu, that never fought for India's freedom, and has a genuine shortage of intelligent and committed political leaders has had - and will have - a very short life.<br/><br/>

                            The best comedy of the year.. AAP is an existential threat to RSS.. RSS is here after 90 years of journey throug innumerous highs and lows and now have roots in even remotest corners of our country.The ideology fuels it is not religion rather,patriotism and devotion to the country. For a swayamsevak,word Hindu is synonymous with all Indians between the Himalayas and the ocean, who finds mother india as their Karmabhoomi as well as punyabhoomi..Being in the pond of Delhi,Never underestimate size of an Ocean..
