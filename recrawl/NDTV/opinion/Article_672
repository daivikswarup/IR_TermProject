Headline::::My Country is a Racist Country - Built on the Lie of Freedom and Opportunity



DateTime::::2015-06-24T12:41:00+05:30




                                Spanish clothing retailer Zara is weathering scrutiny this week after being accused of implementing aggressively racist policies in its New York City stores . In a survey of 251 employees - roughly one-sixth of Zara's New York workforce - black employees in particular reported mistreatment from management, and many workers said they were ordered to racially profile customers.
In the survey, conducted by pro-worker advocacy group the Center for Popular Democracy, employees recalled being instructed to flag certain shoppers as "special orders" over their radio headsets - a code signalling that the customer was a likely shoplifter and should be followed and watched. According to survey respondents, signs that a customer might qualify as a special order included being African American, being a black person and "dressing a certain way" (ie, I guess, wearing any clothes that don't completely obscure your black skin). In a particularly egregious anecdote, "One black employee claimed that when he had come in to pick up a cheque one day wearing a hooded jacket he was identified as a special order and prevented from entering a back office." Ah, well, an unfortunate series of misunderstandings, perhaps.Furthermore, the report alleges, "Lighter-skinned employees of colour and white employees experienced better treatment within the company, with higher-status assignments, more work hours and a stronger likelihood of being promoted."
Whoopsy-daisy! Bygones, at this point, I'm sure. Not to mention that Zara is currently being sued by its former lawyer, who alleges homophobic and antisemitic treatment in the company's corporate offices.
It could happen to anyone! Lawyers, am I right?!
Zara has also been accused of using racist imagery in its products: once for selling a bag emblazoned with swastikas; once for selling a pendant shaped like a person in blackface; once for selling a shirt featuring the slogan "White is the new black"; and once for selling a shirt styled to look like a concentration camp uniform.
Uh, ha. HA HA. Probably just a clerical error. I'm sure we'll all laugh about this later.
Zara's canny corporate spokesperson - seeing right through this long list of totally unrelated innocent coincidences that by pure accident all happen to look like racist garbage behaviour, probably because a butterfly flapped its wings in Johannesburg or something - responded to the allegations of racial discrimination with sputtering denial:
The baseless report was prepared with ulterior motives and not because of any actual discrimination or mistreatment. It makes assertions that cannot be supported and do not reflect Zara's diverse workforce. Zara USA believes that the report is completely inconsistent with the company's true culture and the experiences of the over 1,500 Zara employees in New York City. We are an equal-opportunity employer, and if there are individuals who are not satisfied with any aspect of their employment we have multiple avenues for them to raise issues that we would immediately investigate and address.
Referring to the claims about black customers being disproportionately identified with the code words "special orders", it said: "We are a global, multicultural company serving valued customers across 88 countries, and do not tolerate discrimination of any form."
Yes. Of course you don't.
As we all know from the anguished howls of quivering white people that erupt any time a person of colour expresses any dissatisfaction about being murdered by police, disenfranchised by voter suppression, trapped in cycles of systemic poverty and/or treated like a criminal when they're just trying to buy a horrible, $49 mauve bodysack, nobody in the world is ever racist, except for actual KKK members and the ghost of George Wallace. As Martin Luther King said in his famous speech Hey, Don't Criticise White People, ahem: "Criticising white people is mean because they don't like it. Instead, be nice to them no matter what they do. It's racist for white guys NOT to use the N-word, if you think about it. PS Elvis invented rock and roll."
Therefore - even though the accusations levelled by the Zara employees are so common and predictable that I would believe them even from employees of a store that didn't traffic in concentration camp cosplay - the Zara corporation must, surely, be innocent. There must be something else afoot. Like, say, a bunch of random retail employees all over New York City either colluding in massive secret meetings or coincidentally inventing exactly the same very specific lies about experiencing racist abuse from their totally non-racist employer. Even though the racist policies that Zara supposedly enforced - both subtle and overt - are so ubiquitous in American labour history that we have had to pass many federal and state laws to prohibit them - and establish numerous non-profit organizations to fight them full-time when those laws fail. Even though black people are absolutely, definitely, incessantly followed around in stores. Even though black children are followed around in stores.
At what point can we stop denying and debating simple truths? At what point can we start acknowledging that the simplest explanation is probably the correct one?
The US, my country, is a racist country. It's a country built on white supremacy and the lie of freedom and opportunity - a place where white people live measurably safer, freer, more validated and prosperous lives, where the dehumanisation of black people was literally written into the constitution by slave-owners we are expected to worship, yet where even saying the words "white supremacy" is taboo. Why? Why can't we just speak the truth?
It's not a coincidence that today I came across two stories of white women who pretended to be robbed and assaulted so they could blame groups of fictional black men. It's not a coincidence that the police bought white mass murderer and terrorist Dylann Roof a burger on his way to jail, but shot dead 12-year-old black child Tamir Rice for playing in a park. The familiar silhouette of Roof's crime - a deadly attack by a white racist on a southern black church - is not just a quirk of history, and neither is the fact that several major GOP politicians, whose candidacies rest on leveraging white bigotry and fear, took money from a white nationalist group that may have helped crystallise Roof's hate. It's not an anomaly that data indicates millennials are almost as racist as their parents . It's not an accident that a cheap-clothing company encourages its employees to assume most black people are thieves. And on and on and on.
What if the Zara spokesperson had just said, "We're sorry. We hear you. We'll do better," instead of bending over backwards to to deny any possible shred of culpability? You know what not-racist companies and people do? Acknowledge racism. Pay attention. Work. Change.
The simplest explanation is true. Endlessly contorting yourself to deny the mechanics of the world around you doesn't trick people into thinking you're not racist. It reveals you as a twisted fool.

                            It's funny to read about the NYC's racism linked on an Indian channel. My India where untouchability is still a reality. Where cast decides if someone is allowed to do business instead of cleaning the toxic canals. The only racism I have come across in my 6 years in NYC was from Indian shop keepers or doormen who can't stand the sight of fellow Indians doing better than them. I return the favor always though.

                            It is interesting to see this Guardian article (a left wing newspaper) here. Such discrimination is FAR more rampant in India - it is a nightmare to rent an apartment as a Muslim in any decent neighborhood in almost any Indian city. (Of course, not just Muslims, many apartment owners in Mumbai even refused to consider my friend as a tenant because from his last name they assume he is Bengali and eats fish!). Indians are not just bigoted (not all, but most) but proud of their bigotry. Media here seldom talks about it (unlike in the US) because upper caste Hindus don't like to hear how bigoted we are - we fulminate against affirmative action claiming we are for equality but threaten to kill our daughters if they marry a Dalit or Muslim. Things are WAY better in the US, when hate crimes happen people responsible go to jail. That usually doesn't happen in India.

It is just article trying to project some facts that racism is do present in every part of world in little. Why do you guys need to bring even India into this. I believe it would have been copied by every media in every country. Wow who is feeling guilty here ...

                            This is a pointless article. I mean why take the trouble to state the obvious in so many words. You have obliterated the Native Americans, the people from Africa were brought as slaves and are struggling till date, the people of middle east have been targeted relentlessly in direct as well as political attacks. But it is not just the Americans. It is primarily started from Europe as they went to different parts of the world and destroyed the natives who lived in peace with nature- in Australia, India, Africa, south east Asia, south america, north america. Glad that at-least China has held out till date.

                            There is also another form of racialism. Secular misdeeds and violences are least reported or never reported demanding taking the incidents to the logical conclusions through various processes.

                            My view is that humans by nature are racist - no matter who they are and where they are. They always tend to operate in groups and grouping is always based on the preferences suitable to a particular group - so that may be caste, creed, religion, nationality, colour, gender. How we define and differentiate between discrimination and racism is up to us.

                            Well, India and Indians are the most racists hands down!Our country is divided in to following,<br/>
1. For people from North, anything below Madhya Pradhesh is Madras and Madrasis! For people from South, anything including Maharashtra upwards is North India and North Indians.<br/>
2.Every one wants to speak in his/her own language (which is understandable) but wants other to learn the same when people move to their place from other part of India. Same set of people will speak to their kids in english and will be proud to speak in english when they go abroad!<br/>
3. All "North Indians" are arrogant according to "South Indians" and all "South Indians" are staunch for their languages.<br/>
4. In the same state votes are given in the order of "my religion"- "my caste" - "my language"..."My country" is the last on the list!<br/>
5. We call whites racists, and beat up African,Iranian students on the account of spreading nuisance to our Great Culture!<br/><br/>
We are probably the most arrogant and rude people on earth, treat servants like dogs, treat females like an object and think everything in India is a pure gold! But everything is acceptable under the name of Culture. Wake up!! you are only fooling yourself if you can't see it.

                            Racism exists every where in the world. A first step in the right direction would be to admit it. Civilized humans just need to constantly work on overcoming this. Just indulging in political correctness and trying to judge who is less racist and who is more is a pointless exercise.

                            Blacks, Browns, Grays, Reds &amp; Yellows suffer indignities in the name of White superiority with the consent of the Jew (through his control of the money supply, which is not to be confused with its ownership... even though his share isn't unsubstantial , to say the least; but he will protest vehemently at the notion but methinks he protests too much), who in spite of getting it up the ying-yang over centuries from that nefarious lot, continues to use his machiavellian ways to favor the pig-colored-skin lot. What to do with whites/jews? Can the world survive without them? What would their god do to us or our gods assuming that their god is superior? Could we work it out among ourselves or are our designs foiled by their ever increasing cunning? Does the GOD favor white/jew over the rest of us? And what kind of judge is he, if he is so partial? Are we just slaves all but in name? Can the 80% take on the 20% plus 13,000,000?

                            Indians are not racist. It is the politicians who give everything a communal an religious angle. I was educated in America. And I want to say few things America needs to grow up and make a change in its amendment, it needs more racial openness. There needs to be Islam,Brown,Native American, Asian nationalities broadcast and welcomed in all areas. Until you've lived in America it's tempting to think that it's the modicum of forward thinking. But it's pretty much the most backward,racist, ignorantly populated country in the advanced spectrum of countries I've ever been in.

                            US is not only a racist country but also an imperialist one. Well, then again what can you expect from a country full of shopkeepers and a president who's main job is to act as a salesman for US corporates. PS: India is as bigoted as the US and unfortunately it is also turning into a shopkeeper country

                            This article is one of the many white and Indian origin youngsters in U.S. Who think it is fashionable to call US a racist country picking from a few isolated instances. I am a proud Indian and American who can vouch after living in U.S. Nice 1985 that I never have faced a single white or black American ever discriminating against me and my educational and professional prospects. On the contrary they have facilitated my college hours and promotions in the jobs purely on merit. I faced reverse discrimination having just born a Brahmin in India then being an Indian in U.S.  Just has upper class elites always for for the rights of lower classes and minorities in India, in U.S. Majority of people are decent and promoting equality for all. So, I find reverse bias in this writer in British ultra lib news paper. Don't be so overwhelmed with joy, this is the same news paper who has demeaned Indians and our overwhelmingly elected PM, his party and his originals favoring most corrupt congress of Nehru dynasty!! It is fashionable for NYTimes leaning this news paper to proudly republish such articles of hate America and hate India thoughts.

                            Don't be ashamed writer, in India some castes are untouchable, not allowed to use wells, not allowed to enter places of Worship. And if they defy these rules then their women are  paraded Naked, gang raped, beaten to death. You are far better. A wing of those are actually ruling this nation.

I live in nyc and been to zara many times and never felt it but I'm not black so I can't say I have had their experience. I will say I feel very safe and not 'different' in this wonderful melting pot. Love this city so this comes as a real surprise.  Very often when Indians get together and talk they speak of blacks as though they are somehow inferior . That may have to do with economics and education but it reads as racist. We still choose brides, comment on babies mentioning skin color without a thought. This woman may call the us racist. I suggest she try living elsewhere as a non white.
