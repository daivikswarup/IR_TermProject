Headline::::5 Reasons for Advantage Modi in Bihar



DateTime::::2015-09-16T22:37:00+05:30




                                One of the tiredest cliches in recent times is the oft-repeated comment of Harold Wilson that "A week is too long a time in politics". It has been cloned in multiple forms to suggest the fragility of political forecasts. If a week is a long time, certainly six weeks is like ages in making a political prognosis. However, there can be no greater vindication of this cliche; than the six weeks which have elapsed since Modi began his rallies in Muzaffarpur on the July 25. Prior to that date, analysts had suggested a close fight, a razor's edge, a hung outcome and at best, a photo finish between the NDA and the Grand Alliance. Having gone to all Modi rallies beginning from Muzaffarpur and ending on the September 1 in Bhagalpur, I witnessed not incremental but tectonic attitudinal changes. This alters the likely prognosis. So what has changed so significantly? Why does the outcome look so different now? Part of the reason is no doubt on account of a closer analysis of perceived electoral psyche and what may be called the basic fundamentals. How have these fundamentals been recycled in the minds of voters?  
I believe there are five key factors:
1) The traditional debate between development versus identity politics has played out for long. Most analysts minutely examine the caste and sub-caste components, assuming falsely I believe that local leadership can mechanically transfer votes from one entity to another. Electoral calculus based on such mechanical calculations may be traditional but increasingly naive. While opinion polls are often misleading, they are also pointers of broad directions. Consider for instance the recent opinion poll by News24 based on the findings of the Chanakya group according to which 57% people responded that the caste factor will not play an important role while more than 50% consider that the traditional Muslim-Yadav combination will not affect the Bihar polls. Over 40% emphasized the importance of development along with law and order. Clearly governance and development outcomes have an increasingly important role in shaping voter decisions even in a society as stratified as Bihar. This is where Modi's unequivocal statement at the massive Bhagalpur rally that he is seeking the NDA mandate on a development agenda kicks in so significantly.
2) Nitish's appeal is based on his development record. However, his 10-year report card was presented in the back-drop of governance paralysis during the preceding period. His alliance now with the same forces that he and the people of Bihar hold responsible for its economic stagnation undercuts the credibility of his appeal. How are people to be assured that what happened in the past will not happen again? This also dilutes the electoral acceptance of the Common Economic Programme currently being crafted by the JD(U). Its implementation would remain problematic. Incidentally, Nitish's alliance also embraces the Congress against whom a 10-year campaign had been launched almost in a Mission Mode for denying Bihar a Special Category Status, low central sector outlays and systemic neglect based on partisan considerations. Thus the Modi theorem that trains with two engines run faster than one engine mentioned at the Muzaffarpur Rally, implying the benefits of synchronized action by the state government and the centre, carries a significant message. This has not been missed by the people of Bihar.
3) Do demographic differentials matter? Are voters in a younger group or the youngest group inclined to opt for a different model of governance than the older age group? Empirical evidence of revealed preference remains problematic. However, evidence suggests that a younger age group is more pronounced in its aspirational characteristics than an older age group. In experimental studies of voter's information processing and preferences in the USA, Lau and Redlawsk (2006) found age to have persistent effect in their preference. Age influences the cognitive abilities of individuals. Modi's repetitive comments to audiences in Muzaffarpur and Saharsa about the use of mobile phones, the ability to listen to their favorite songs, the need for digital connectivity, and an assured power supply drew repeated applause from young listeners. Electoral calculus overlooks the voting preference of not only the young but very young Bihar. Furthermore, women constituted an important erstwhile NDA supporter. Greater empowerment to Local Bodies, reservation in Government recruitments, bicycle programs and other measures had tilted their preferences towards Nitish. However, the recent dramatic increase in crime rates against women, which has increased by 11% during 2012-13, alters choices; Increasingly they look aligned to the choice of the very young.   
4) While Bihar may have made progress in recent years, it is nowhere close to its potential or compelling needs. Successive Committees have analysed the ingredients of its backwardness. Apart from a stratified social order inhibiting freer mobility of labour and capital, the more contemporary factors relate to reticence of private capital, given the poor security environment, unreliable infrastructure, absence of job opportunities, stagnant agriculture and large outward migration. The Bihar Special Package announced recently by Modi at Saharsa of the public outlay of 1.25 lakh crores for multi-sectoral projects is a step in this very direction. The development projects planned under the Bihar Special Package will lead to significant benefits and positive outcomes for the state- both direct and indirect. The direct outcomes include enhanced GDP growth, improved skills, gainful employment and improved agricultural productivity. It makes Bihar a large common market, securing intra-state integration and catalyzing private investment.
5) A recent DIPP-World Bank report titled "Assessment of State Implementation of Business Reforms" (September 2015) looks at the reforms implemented by states under the 98-point Action Plan on "Ease of Doing Business" during January 1 to June 30, 2015. Overall, Bihar ranks at 21st among all States and Union Territories in the country and was among the 16 states with poor implementation status between 0% and 25% that needs an immediate jump start to reach 100% implementation. Seeking synergy with the ambitious "Make In India" program and the extensive 98-point reform program coupled with implementing the Bihar Special Package can make a decisive difference. Piggy-backing on large public outlays can catalyze substantial private flows. This is something which the state failed to do earlier or even in the last ten years of the Nitish's rule.
The sequence of events have changed and so have the equations. Demographic differentials, the hope and expectations generated in the minds of the younger voters, the quest for better life quality and the probability of the Modi governance rubric delivering outcomes distinctly better have altered the prognosis. Bihar is poised for an NDA win. The coming weeks will only consolidate this likely outcome.NK Singh is a member of the BJP, former MP (Rajya Sabha), has held key bureaucratic assignments and has been a member of the Planning Commission.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Reason 1 : communal polarisation<br/>
Reason 2 : Caste arithmetic<br/>
Reason 2: vote for note<br/>
Reason 3: abuse of election machinery<br/>
Reason 4: alcohol..<br/><br/>
But then RSS will still loose, just like it did in Delhi.  Dream on sanghi loosers!

                            I agree with NK. Further, the following political factors are also in favor of NDA:-<br/>
1. For the first time after the gruesome era of mass killings courtesy, MCC and Ranvir Sena, the Upper caste (Landowners) and the Dalits (Landless laborers and sharecroppers) stand united thanks to the Manjhi factor.<br/>
2. Due the seat sharing agreement between JD (U) and RJD, about 20 Mahagathbandhan sitting MLAs will be deined ticket by JD (U). They will definitely turn rebel.<br/>
3. In the 40 seats of Congress, NDA will have decisive edge particularly if BJP fights these seats.<br/>
4. NCP &amp; SP, Pappu Yadav and Owaisi will eat into the votes of Mahagathbandhan.<br/>
5. In many seats RJD candidates came close 2nd while JDU won them. However, now only one of them can be given ticket. The other one will not accept not fighting.

                            May be the last chance for the people of Bihar to join the main stream of development and prosperity by rejecting the time and again failed political system of the state. How long the people of Bihar will continue to go for petty jobs to other states by leaving their dear ones behind at the mercy of lawlessness and misfortune ?

                            Good analysis. The law of percentages is against the RJD-JD-Congress combine - the RJD wir get a success rate of max 50% of the seats contested, JDU max 30% &amp; Congress max 10% which translates into 84 seats though the actual could be lesser by 15% ie 71 seats out of 243, (NDA 172 with BJP getting a simple majority on its own)  since the odds in the perception battle are stacked against the mahagatbandhan when Biharis see Nitish sharing stage with Lalu and Congress.

                            The 18 week Bihar poll campaign has now entered 13th week. It started with an offensive crusade against Modi govt. The fodder for the first few weeks was LalitGate and Vyapam. The media managed the maneuver without touching sekular front.

                            I agree women would play a significant role in this election. However it is an axiom that development, progress and jobs hold good for all aspirational classes. Harping on caste would not do any good to the kitchen. Jobs are the way ahead for Bihar. Whoever promises these will go ahead.

                            I don't know what led you to write this  Mr. NK Singh? I also don't know how much you understand Bihar politics. But one thing is sure that there is no other issue than caste in Bihar. These are articles written for elite class in metros. These are not going to change the mood of people. I can see chances of NDA only because votes of a community, which is used to be scattered,  is still polarized in favor of NDA.

                            Sublime analysis by the author. High time that Bihar voted for development. People may say Modi's initiatives are mostly "jumlas" but in the last one and a half year, the country has progressed in various sectors. True that in some fields, we haven't achieved much of a breakthrough but things have begun to change.<br/><br/>
An alliance which includes convict Lalu is just too dangerous for Bihar's development.

                            N K Singh is the same corrupt officer who arm twisted businesses and minted money during Vajpayee rule along with Ranjan Bhattacharya and Brajesh Mishra. Today he's all for governance. Nitish was the best till he made him an MP, when he denied him a se one term due to hobnobbing with corporates he became really bad. Shameless creature!

                            I think it is going to be a tough contest. I think that if Nitish had sided with BJP, he would have got a clear majority. Now people of Bihar will be confused as Nitish had good record compared to previous CMs, but people voted for Nitish (JDU BJP alliance) to keep out Lalu and congress. I still believe that Nitish is a good CM and he should make alliance with BJP.

                            No way. People of Bihar will vote as per their DNA which calls to vote for Nitish. BJP means hatred only, they are corrupt, sarcastic and with PM supporting those accused in Vyaapam, Lalitgate, having communal flavor, BJP govt is taking India in wrong direction. When Nitish was with NDA, the growth rate used is 11%, now he has left NDA, Bihar drops to 21st position in business. These all are RSS-BJP propaganda to insult Bihar.  This article in justification of joining BJP by Ex-beurocrats who were on pay-roll on private players during their tenure and were working more for RSS rather than government
