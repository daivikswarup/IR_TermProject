Headline::::Mani-Talk: Modi is Turning Us into America's New Pakistan



DateTime::::2015-02-03T17:05:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)
	During Cold War I between the US and the USSR in the 20th century, the US co-opted Pakistan as its "most reliable ally". With the onset of Cold War II in the 21st century, now between the US and China, Barack Obama made his Republic Day visit to India to woo Narendra Modi to become the US's most reliable ally. Modi doubled over backwards to oblige.
	We are being rapidly dragged into the abyss of confrontation, abandoning the signature tune of Gandhiji and Nehru - peaceful coexistence. We are on the edge of becoming America's Pakistan at the brink of Cold War II. History must serve as our guide as Modi takes the plunge.
	India under Nehru reacted to US overtures in the mid-20th century by setting our face against all forms of military involvement with one side or the other. It was called Non-alignment. We were the first and, at the time, only Non-aligned country in 1947. 36 years later, when the seventh Non-aligned Summit was held in New Delhi in 1983, two-thirds of the Member-States of the UN turned up in our capital at Head of State/Head of Government level. No foreign policy of any country in the 20th century turned out to be as widespread in its global influence as Nehru's. Nehru showed the way. Virtually every newly independent nation followed. Until we got embroiled in the 1962 war with China, Non-aligned India was the country of choice for settling almost every international crisis - Palestine in 1947; Korea in 1953; Indo-China the following year; Suez in 1956; the Congo in 1960. Even when the world initially disagreed, as with India's recognition of China after Mao's revolution, everyone eventually came around to accepting the reality.
	On decolonization, India's was the first and last word. We were the first to boycott racist South Africa and the first to rejoice when half a century later Nelson Mandela joined with Willem de Klerk in Africa's Gandhi moment. From Algeria to Namibia, over three long decades, India was the acknowledged champion of the End of Empire. On disarmament, India gave the lead. On mobilizing the world to regard development as a global responsibility, India again led the rest in securing global trade concessions for developing countries in GATT and establishing the Group of 77 in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
	Meanwhile, independent India's development was so impressive compared to its colonial past that when Walter Rostow published in 1960 his breakthrough work, The Stages of Growth, and was asked which underdeveloped country he thought would first reach the "take-off" stage, he unhesitatingly pointed to India. Besides, of course, we were the only country of nearly 150 who have come to liberation of one kind or another since we became independent, to have translated Independence for India into freedom for her people, combining full-scope democracy with a socialistic pattern of society and sincerity in secularism, backed by a voice of our own in international affairs that was respected by all even when disagreement was strong. We established that foreign policy is the external expression of internal sovereignty - and although the West balked at that, it did not prevent us from essentially "viewing the world with clear and friendly eyes", as Nehru remarked on the day we became Independent. We were friends, but not allies, of both the East and the West.
	Pakistan, by the turn of the century, was left a client State of an increasingly disenchanted patron. Since Clinton, it has been downgraded as the preferred partner for the 21st century, cast aside like a used glove. Today, its most sturdy patron is China.
	Readers as old as I am will remember Vice-President Lyndon Johnson visiting Pakistan during Kennedy's Presidency and taking Pakistan swirling into euphoria when he invited a Pakistani camel-driver to the US as a State guest. A decade later, the US-Pakistan partnership reached its highest (or lowest) point when the US stood rock solid behind Pakistan as the Pakistani army butchered ordinary East Pakistanis and drove ten million of them as refugees into India, thus sparking the war that led on 16 December 1971 to the dismemberment of Pakistan and the emergence of Bangladesh. Small reward for Peshawar having served as the base for U2 spy flights over the Soviet Union and as Kissinger's launch pad for his rapprochement (now breaking down) with China.
	In the years that followed, the US led Pakistan by the nose into the mess of Afghanistan. The Mujahideen, transported from the Arab world and Central Asia to the Pak-Af border, and trained and supplied by the US on the soil of its most reliable partner, has now become the Frankenstein that has rendered Pakistan both the hub of global terrorism and its biggest victim. Meanwhile, the people of Pakistan have been denied the democracy that had come so readily to India because India eschewed military engagement with the US while the Pakistani armed forces became the US's principal client and, therefore, the rulers of Pakistan or in between the puppeteers of civil governments. Seventy years of servitude to America has ended in America becoming the most hated, if most desired, country in Pakistan.
	At the end of a half-century and more of becoming a military ally of the United States, Pakistan's society, polity and economy lie in tatters while Non-aligned India rides high. Modi does not seem to have learned the lesson. Quite taken at his transformation from a communalist denied a visa to the US to being feted by the US President, India under Modi is being enticed into a military partnership with the US as it attempts to encircle China in the way the US in the twentieth century had sought to encircle the Soviet Union. From being a disengaged peace-maker, and therefore, a highly influential independent operator in foreign policy, as India was from Nehru to Indira to Rajiv Gandhi, we now have Modi cozying up to the United States in the military sphere as if he were a Liaquat Ali Khan, a Feroze Khan Noon or a civilian Ayub Khan/ Yahya/ Zia-ul-Haq. That is the real story behind the recent Obama visit that has dragooned India into the disputes of others in the South China Sea.
	One final warning and I am done. Cold War I was a far-away war, the potential battle-field being Europe. Cold War II is much nearer. It is burgeoning on our doorstep. If it comes to hot war, the most likely battle-field will be India. Is that how we wish to transmogrify the India of Mahatma Gandhi by the time we reach the centenary of our Independence?Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

1.We should be clear in our stand rather than sitting on fence singing non alignment which didnt take us any where<br/>
2.We can be friendly with both China,US and Russia...if we display courage to do so<br/>
3.We ought to participate in war against Terror...Its of no meaning to be silent..and sobbing for terror against us.

UN has already issued warning to all non-BJP states to take steps and moreover there is no cure for this disease so far.

                            I do not agree with Mani. The very fact that the BJP came to power is that the Hindus were utterly disgusted with the Congress rule- scams, vote bank politics, appeasement of Muslims forgetting that India is a secular state, treating Hindus in a step motherly fashion, having its main policy as dynastic rule(in a democracy!!!)( even ensuring dynastic succession among other congress leaders), etc. Hindus by nature are secular but needling them to be always in power will have negative effect.

                            MSA is at his favourite pass time again...Modi bashing. He has become an expert I must say. If everything that was done by the Nehru - Gandhi family and by implication the Congress governments down the years - the best, then why is the congress still giving slogans such as alleviate poverty, generate more job opportunity etc. Why isn't India the modern day version of Utopia seeing that the Congress has been in government for most of the 67 years since independence ? As for Modi cozying up to the US...I wish to remind MSA that successive Congress led governments have cozied up to USSR...this was more so during the Indira Gandhi years when Breznev was the Soviet president. One incident which the congress conveniently wishes the people to forget is the Indo-China war. It was Kennedy sending US warships to the region which halted the Chinese aggression. All through this war USSR was 'non-aligned' and chose to look the other way. The reason - China was and still is a Communist country. So it is better if MSA and the Congress by implication stops sermonising and pontificating. They do not have the records to back up their advice.

                            And what did Congress convert us to? A bunch of left wing lunatics. And what has that socialism given to India. A divided society. Licence raj turned the crony capitalists of Congress into a rich breed, and indeed a lot of Congressmen got rich as well on kickbacks. That fault-line got wider in the last decade. Just look at the scams. And the superiority that Congress people have - almost we are a class above you, born to rule you masses. that was confirmed by Iyers comments about chai walla.

Last time you said you were proud to be NOT nominated by PM for Swach Bharat movement. You are mentally sick. Check in with a psychiatrist. And the nuclear deal was signed with by Congress. So, what you are speaking doesn't make sense. And get over this Nehru-Gandhi chant. We are fed up of the Gandhis and their chamchas. India has moved on.

(By the way In Nehru's Non-Aligned approach it was OK to be friend of All Socialist Leftist nations but not with Capitalist ones? Naah). Non-Alignment is a Respectable &amp; philosophical Term used for describing what is called as Fence-Sitting in Common English. But Mani can't stoop so low as to use common English phrases.

                            Modi's foreign policy is best ever after independence. Now there is no alignment to any one force in the name of non alignment. we are close equally to all three major forces USA, Rassia and china and maintaining safe distance from each one. this is the real non alignment, only thinking of country's benefit. doing business with everybody each and every country, no enmity to any other country. india will show the world how to make friendship with everybody without fighting or any inhibition. even the plan B is ready for business like Japan. Australia. Germany, Vietnam and so many. Plan C is to maintain good relation with neighboring country feel them comfortable with aids and isolate Pakistan from the rest of the world. i he has successfully implemented india's desired foreign policy.

                            Interesting article and to some extent I agree. But as you mentioned " From being a disengaged peace-maker, and therefore, a highly influential independent operator in foreign policy, as India was from Nehru to Indira to Rajiv Gandhi", so what after Rajiv Gandhi? After him, its more than two decades, what did we do in these two decades with Gandhi-led congress government?

                            The writer should remember that Nehru was mostly ignored by the great powers. He foolishly squandered India's chance to be on the UN Security Council and pursued a self-destructive foreign policy that left us without allies and friends. We were fortunate that the U.S. backed us in 1962 and the Soviet Union backed us in 1971. These fortuitous events have little to do with Nehru; they were merely a calculated strategic risk that each great power took. Had we allied with the US and joined the Western sphere of liberal democracy, we'd be in the same league today as Japan, Germany, France, Australia, and Canada. Instead we've inherited Nehruvian deadweight in all spheres of our political life. Modi, unlike Manmohan Singh, commands respect because he's the first PM (apart from Vajpayee) to undo the damage Nehru wrought on us. If anything, Modi has been successful despite, not because, of Nehru.

A country that cannot stop its mischievous neighbour from thei daily doze of bullets and shells, a country that cannot fully control traitors in its border state.  All these shortcomings were because of faulty internal and external policies wheich were actually camaflouged to suit some family and their dealings.

                            The article sounds good to read, but Mani has forgot to mention that Nehru was responsible for creating Pakistan. Today's contemporary world we should learn to look forward than what happened in 19th and 20th century, and don't compare India with Pakistan, we are matured country and have a long history, and we know how to deal with west, there are about 30 million Indians in 200 countries and we are widely connected around the globe, many Indians are on top academicians, corporate and government honchos or businessman. Modi is taking country is in right direction as per my views.

                            Aiyer - You couldn't be more wrong. Let me elaborate. You, perhaps innocently of course, omitted to note that:<br/><br/>
1 -  India, especially under Indira Gandhi aligned so close to the USSR that it became a laughing stock amongs the Africans which although initially supported the idea of NAM, got so disillusioned that they floated the idea of and formed their own African Union to protect themselves. This nexus which started in the 70s carried well into the 90s and the noughties with USSR and Russia supplying all the major arms to India. Furthermore, it was a running joke that Russian Government would know about any of India's state secret before the PMO was informed. And what's more, Congres oversaw that piffle supine performance dancing to the Russian tune;<br/><br/>
2 - No country, let alone, India benefitted in any shape or form and in any discernible scope from NAM. It was one of those calamitous failures which political course still teach the students about "how NOT to conduct a multi-lateral network". Is there any shame in accepting that it was simply a glorified talking shop for the champagne socialists while each sold blank lies in their home countries, including your party;<br/><br/>
3 - US made the overtures in the 50s to India and India rejected it. Rightly or wrongly, it manifested in US aligning with Pakistan and India with the USSR. <br/><br/>
4 - Congress recognised the importance of closer ties with the US because it was better to stand with a wealthy acquiantance than with a bankrupt socialist broken USSR. Why do you assume that Modi will bend over backwards (India did with USSR) to accommodate the US? Do you have any proof of that? At least Indians have the proof of Congress' legacy with the USSR. <br/><br/>
One last word - yes there is a cold war II looming on the horizon. Yes, India is staring at it. It is misguided and illiterate to assume that India will be the first country to be annexed while it bangs on about NAM. It will be the first. Would you rather have that than no coalition of like minded nations?

Modi's followers are blinded by the leader's great ability to talk talk and talk hopefully there will be atleast a 50% delivery of all that has been spoken. <br/><br/>
Seems like the present government is no different than the other previous governments. Spending energy on reopening age old cases, command of the party is centralized to three people only thing they don't belong to one family but the concept is the same. bringing in Kiran bedi as CM candidate from no where a classic example similar to Rahul tearing up some ordinance in a press out of the blue.

What the cough did Nehru get from non-alignment? No market for India and not even a Nobel prize for peace for himself. On the contrary, we faced 3 wars remaining non-aligned, world hood-winked Pakistan's nuclear program and terrorism. His own daughter and grandson died at the hands of terrorists when the world didn't align with us either!<br/>
Only interests are permanent. Ideologies change every 100 years, religions every 1000 years. Non-alignment should be ditched if it has served its purpose.
