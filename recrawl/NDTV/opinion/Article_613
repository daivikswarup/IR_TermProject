Headline::::Modi Charms Chinese Kids With Selfies, But At Home...



DateTime::::2015-05-16T22:30:00+05:30




                                What is it about this Government's approach towards women and children? Even as images of the Prime Minister's China trip show Narendra Modi charming Chinese children with selfies, back in India, just before the scheduled trip, he had presided over a cabinet meeting which gave approval to legalise labour of children in India below the age of 14, in "family enterprises."
Will our Prime Minister be equally proud in showing off selfies with our poor and emaciated children bending over packets of bidis they are being forced to bind in "family enterprises" which he has legalised?
India and China became independent within two years of each other. At the time, each country was beset with the scourge of poverty, inequality and brutal exploitation. It is not as though China does not face social and economic problems today. But the Chinese Government, which has ensured the universal right to free education for its children many decades ago in pursuit of socialist goals of justice, which has legislated against child labour, will not now in the 21st century come out with a law which legalizes child labour simply because it still exists in pockets of that country. It is expected to display the political will required to completely eliminate such a cruel practice as depriving a child of her childhood.
In India, on the other hand, the Union Cabinet has given approval to introduce a retrograde amendment in the law against child labour, to legalise the labour of children upto the age of 14 in "family enterprises" after school hours and during vacations. It is unthinkable that a Government which claims to be "development" oriented should seek to destroy the development of India's children, allowing the exploitation of the labour of children below the age of 14. To suggest that "poverty and the social fabric of India" justify the use of child labour is to punish children for their poverty, a poverty created by the policies of successive Governments.
As is well known with the trend of outsourcing, many developed industries farm out work to contractors, who further farm out work to families who work round the clock at exploitative rates. This is in addition to other trades such as bidi-making, agarbattis, carpet-weaving etc. where children have been made to work. Instead of taking measures to incentivise families in poverty to end the practice of putting their own children to work, the Modi Government wants to legalise it. Since it is almost impossible to regulate "family enterprises", such an amendment will open the floodgates for the rampant use and abuse of child labour.
Make in India is yet to create jobs. But in the meanwhile, if Made in India is going to include Made in India Legally by Child Labour, it will be a travesty of justice. Citizens should use all means available to make sure this does not happen.
But this is not the only blow against rights and interests of children. Earlier, the budgetary allocations for schemes run by the Ministry of Women and Child Development suffered a cut of over Rs. 10,000 crore in the first full budget of the Modi Sarkar. Soon after, the Government moved an amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha to the Juvenile Justice Act to have minors between the ages of 16-18 tried as adults for heinous crimes. It is true that it is abhorrent that a 17-year-old accused, and then convicted of say, for example, rape, gets let off in a year when he turns an adult, since clearly a year is hardly enough for him to undergo the process of reform. But there are other ways within the JJ Act itself which can be used to monitor and assist him in processes of reform including in separate half way homes. Many women's and child right organisations have made practical suggestions within the framework of the JJ Act which the Government has chosen to ignore. The problem is that India has not invested in the social and physical infrastructures mandated by the law to assist and help children and minors in conflict with the law, a large majority of whom are from poor and deprived families.
Instead, the Government seems determined to push them into adult jails and ensure that chances of reform become all the more remote. Fortunately, the Bill is yet to be discussed and adopted in the Rajya Sabha, and if there is strong enough public opinion mobilized against this amendment which was rejected by the Verma Commission as well as the Parliamentary Standing Committee, perhaps the Government will see some sense.
Meanwhile let's at least try to stop the legalisation of child labour whether in the name of family or not.(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            A 14 year old will be able to work during holidays and non school hours so that he can earn something if he wants to or needs to. I wonder what the parents had done to produce someone with so much of negative energy. Has anyone heard of anything positive from this woman in the last 20 - 30 years? What a miserable soul.

Seems like every opposition has ganged up to bring down Modi or find faults in his policies conveniently forgetting that the reason they are in the opposition is because of their own doings. But all these acts wll only garner more suppost for Modi and make him stronger.

                            Madam, face one fact. Under your party's rule of several decades, West Bengal was converted to one of the poorest states of the country. Calcutta, once a shining example of what a metropolis should be, became a large dirty city pocketed with slums. You talk of China, your masters, taking their country forward with the pragmatic thinking, but your party was stuck in pre 50's communist and socialistic thinking, propaganda and slogans, keeping West Bengal in the throes of poverty, while not just the rest of the country, but even your masters, China, marched ahead. You live in a fragile glass house. Throw stones at your own peril.

                            My understanding is that the cabinet passed a law outlawing child labour, but made an exception to children helping out parents provided that this was after school hours. Something wrong with that? You have deliberately mis represented the facts.

New to democracy or what? Nothing that Mr. Modi does is fine by you. How long will you continue to criticize him without facts or bases? Get a life! Your entertainment value notwithstanding, remember that you are able to dissent, not because of some inalienable right proclaimed in Greece or England (or even the closer-to-home-yet-ancient Licchavi republic for that matter), but only and precisely because Mr. Modi represents the Hindutva world view. So get used to democracy, pluralism, enlightenment...it was restored in Modern India on May 16 2014 and, is here to stay.<br/><br/>

                            There was a thought process which has it's own valid reasons. I see that other parties also approved. <br/>
All communists who talk agaisnt Child Labor and insist the education need to provide a solution rather than reminding the problem. Today Children are source of income and unless we show an alternative, we need to strike a balance before reaching the stage of educating them. <br/>
My personal experience of adopting the labor and trying to educate them failed. But her guardian as well as the girl are happy doing some service to us and get money. Poverty is such difficult to eradicate. People cant survive till they are educated. Either Brinda must offer a workable solution or accept the facts.

                            Factually incorrect. The ammendment of the child labour act in 2012 (passed in 2013) has the same clause "that children under 14 can work for their family members".  This was a UPA ammendment and not a NDA one.  Secondly, the recommendation was made by the parliamentary standing Committee on 2013 after consultation with children's rights activist like Sathyarthi. The simple fact is that children learn their family business by working with their parents,  and the previous bill was wrongfully treating this as an instance of exploitative child labour.  What the NDA's ammendment does is to strengthen the punishment for breaking rules like "mandatory day off" for such instances of children working in family businesses. The CPIM unfortunately is desparate to make political gains and is therefore willing to lie to the gullible public. Shame shame!

                            Sorry to say but you've proved that you and your entire CPI(M) Politburo member + other versions of Indian communists are kids in politics. If you and your other member would have been in China, they would have not even allowed to enter Great Hall of China. Instead of going point by point of your mistake (because that is not required for a 60 year old kid) let me say one of your first mistake in your artile (after which understood again the kid has came-up) i.e, China didn't got a independence at the time of India's independence actually CPC came into power after winning a 25 years of Civil war against Chiang Kai-shek's KMT( a nationalist party) and CPC hanged chairman Mao portrait by replacing Chiang Kai-shek's (which they fought tooth &amp; nail by calling it as symbol of fuddle system) there are laundry list of points and arguments where you and stand but I m not going to waste my time by pushing those points towards those who are already pushed into Arabian and Bay of Bengal by people of India.

                            Our PM is working 24 x 7, in order to make the Country achieve an desired inclusive growth for which long term capital is required..As huge capital is required towards this and chances of raising such huge capital from domestic sources is remote, there is need for raising foreign capital.. Towards this we need to create goodwill, friendly relationships alongwith competitive business environment..Modi Govt has within a year done number of legislation, towards ease of doing business, and only thing remaining is raising capital from abroad, which he alone can do, by projecting the Country's image and assuring all support..this is the simple reason, why Modi is traveling so rapidly..

                            Look who is talking a leader of party which is in the verge of extinction and redpondible for lock down of thousands of industries in kerala and WB. They created a generation of jobless youth now advising and blaming Modi. Madam first give job atleast to ten people and then talk . It's easy to strike and stop factories and industries but not as easy to give a livelihood to some one . U must accept the responsibility of current state of WB where even daily labourers are migrating to southern most tips of india for an earning .

                            This article had brought out so many comments about the political origin of the author. Yes she is a political opponent of Modi but why can't the thought be heard without prejudice and then judged purely on the merit rather than who's saying it. Who among us wants to see small children exploited.. Irrespective of political affiliation.. And let's face it, we are a nation where life is generally not valued, much less that of defenseless kids. We all know there is scope for this amendment to be misused and there are probably no measures in place to prevent the misuse. We must think and act like humans and Indians rather than let our loyalty or lack of it for Modi, impact our views.

In fact the trinity she is a part of  is known to hang onto the coattails and much more of powerful men and when they find the power of "their" men diminished try to reinvent themselves. Why she should get space on a public platform defies logic; but then the public face is at least minisculy owned by the family and blood is indeed thicker tan water so the least the sibling and her "man" can do is provide her space for her rants!!

                            There needs to ensure 100% protection from exploitation before allowing child employment in such forms. As of now, Govt does not have any satisfactory mechanism in place to deal with it fully.<br/><br/>
If Govt thinks that Child labour is going to add to net GDP or lessen the juvenile crime rate then they are not weighing in the net loss to the childhood of such children.<br/><br/>
As for Vrinda Karat, she is anti-Indian.

                            Pity Ms. Karat's contentions appear superficial. This isn't expected out of a seasoned politician. The caveat is that children can work in Family Enterprises with a general prohibition on child labor. The key word is "can". If the child doesn't work he/she can refuse to do so. I do not think that any family would "force" the children to work against their will. Let's all accept the fact that most kids do end up working for their family industries whether it is bidi or IT. The government need to carry out necessary audits to make sure there is no abuse happening. There has to be a collaborative effort to make sure the amendment is able to realize the intent behind its passing. Making general assumptions related to misuse doesn't seem mature on her part and looks only at achieving provocative sound bytes. And pray tell, what connection does it have with taking selfies with Chinese kids?

                            I think reporters like you, who need to write something, because you're a reporter is a bigger problem. I think reporters need to take a bigger responsibility and get into the hearth of the problem. I stay 10k miles away from India in the comfy of my million dollar house, and yet I know that the problem is not child labour, the problem is lack of a support system to educate children if they don't work. The problem is education does not reach the brain when the stomach is looking for food. The step by Mr. Modi is a great first step to allow these children to be able to meet their basic needs first and then take on a meaningful education.

Where would we be without your Modi bashing with half truths?  Just so that you know, I worked in my father's cigarette shop during my holidays and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  My father loved having me there.  It did not interfere with my education; I got a master's degree from a UK university and had a vey successful career in finance.  Even in the UK, children are allowed to work with their hours of work being regulated.  All he newspaper boys out in the early hours are paid for the work!  In the USA, youngsters do chores in family businesses.  Your bringing in the beedi business was to add 'masala' to an otherwise mundane, mediocre article.  Why no mention of the fact that Modi is trying to put into action toilets for girls so that they would not leave school?  That wouldn't fit in with your objective would it, of Modi bashing?  I would venture to suggest that no matter how much a child is exploited in India, it wouldn't turn out to be an evil Modi basher who had a charmed life in the heart of London as an Air India employee and with time on her hands waits for the next opportunity to Modi bash!
