Headline::::Let Journalism Thrive - Television and Media Freedom



DateTime::::2015-05-08T23:11:00+05:30



(These remarks were delivered as a Keynote Address at UNESCO, India to observe World Press Freedom Day.)
This is a topic which is very close to my heart: "Let Journalism Thrive -Television and Media Freedom."
In India, specifically, I will applaud the fact that we have come a long way. In 1992, when I entered television journalism, private or independent broadcasters were not allowed.The only agency which was considered 'safe' or competent to provide news on such a powerful medium was state broadcaster, Doordarshan, at that time often referred to as "His Master's Voice" i.e. whatever the government of the day wanted to tell you - so the Information and Broadcasting Minister probably got the most time on bulletins after the Prime Minister.
In fact the only news then a private production house like NDTV was allowed to touch was international news because then there was no danger of being "anti-national". Even then, we pushed the boundaries. I remember reporting from Kashmir in 1992 for The World This Week, as a debate on it was coming up in the United Nations. When I came back, my boss, Prannoy Roy, had to fight with Doordarshan news editors to insist there was absolutely nothing anti-national in the report, because that really was the fear. Letting independent broadcasters in would open a Pandora's Box, and the outcome could only be bad.
Yet, things progressed fast from there. From a news bulletin every night for half an hour which could never be done LIVE, to clearance for a 24-hour news channel, to the present where there are currently over 750 private satellite television stations in India plus around 30 Government channels. So,in India at least, television and journalistic freedom seems to be thriving.
However, let's look at this phenomenon more closely. Does proliferation mean freedom? Also, how is that freedom actually being used? Interestingly, India is ranked no. 136 in the world press freedom index out of 180 countries. To put that in context, we are just below Chad; Ukraine is at 129; and even Afghanistan is at 122, so it doesn't seem like there's much to celebrate here. I personally would find this ranking incorrect, but here's their reason: "India, the world's largest democracy, achieved another peaceful transfer of power through elections in 2014, yet its press freedom score declined to its lowest level in over a decade due to an increase in the use of defamation cases against journalists and a higher level of self-censorship caused by editorial interference from media owners in the lead-up to the elections."
This, I think is an extremely worrying trend - are we being diverted by the volume of television journalism to say all is well? Are we ignoring the challenge to the substance of what we are saying, are there no-go areas, self-imposed censorship NOT because of fear of life, but fear of livelihood? This is a very real threat. The only source television channels have to generate income is ad revenue, so if you don't like what a channel is saying, call the marketing head and threaten to cut advertising. This can range from governments to corporates. If revenues get squeezed, jobs get lost, and with less money available, organisations also cut back on field reporting. This, too, is a real challenge to the freedom of the press because if you don't travel far from the capital of India, the view you present is then one-sided, dominated by a certain perspective. So, sadly, yes, a farmer has to travel to Jantar Mantar to commit suicide to get his voice heard.
Freedom to tell a story is very different from freedom to choose the story you are telling. This is a battle being fought in many newsrooms around the country and unless there is a concerted fight back, the accusations of paid media will stick. Television cannot be cheerleaders for one side vs the other. The moment that happens, we actually lose the battle for credibility and whether it's self-imposed or from outside, the freedom to tell the truth is a right which once gone can never be recovered.
Moving to attacks on the media, physical threats have reduced but journalism is still a high-risk job in many parts of the country. The nature of threats differ. In the crudest form you have actual violence - now these are often groups loyal to a particular ideology, so broadcast something against, say, a particular regional party, and goons will land up to smash the office. There's also a state shutdown when a state government just takes a channel off air as happened recently in Telangana - the reason was 'mocking the assembly'; and of course, there are the so-called defenders of a faith who will land up to disrupt shows if a guest is not to their liking.
A more sophisticated form of violence is creating an atmosphere against the media - the use of words like "newstraders", "presstitutes". The asking for a public trial of media by senior politicians of all parties is a language of intimidation, which we must speak out against in the strongest possible terms. Ironically, opposition politicians love the media when they aren't in power; in government, they become exactly like their predecessors in keeping the media out.
Today,in the world's largest democracy, the press is as much an institution of fair and good governance as our legislature or judiciary.The relationship may seem naturally adversarial but we must believe that ultimately we are working together to better the society we live in. In a joint message, the UN Secretary-General, the Director-General of UNESCO and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said that quality journalism "enables citizens to make informed decisions about their society's development" while also working "to expose injustice, corruption, and the abuse of power." That is hopefully the bedrock of good governance.
In conclusion, let me leave you with this quote by Albert Camus, journalist and philospher. "A free press can, of course, be good or bad, but, most certainly without freedom, the press will never be anything but bad."(Sonia Singh is NDTV's Editorial Director)

                            Most media houses are now profit centers. Profit is primary goal. They can make it by any means and Nepal is a good example of it  where profit was made based on cries. Before that it was a dead farmer. Today its a celebrity murderer. Media has taken freedom by both hands and kicked responsibility by both feet. This is the lowest point i have seen journalism since my childhood where profit bests any life or nation's interest.

                            Sonia Ji, you have just failed to mention abt paid news, or news favouring a entity, freedom cannont be basis of spreading lies, circumventing facts &amp; propagating a particular agenda, conceived to favour a particular political party, plz do remember journalism has to be objective. India lacks it.

                            I recall the days under Indira Gandi and Rajiv Gandhi's Prime-Ministership when AIR and Doordarshan used to enjoy monoply and were under strict control of the government. It was more like propaganda that the government of the times wanted you to hear or see be it the days of Emergency or Operation Bluestar or 1984 riots, there was no one to strike a discordoant note.

                            I personally hate opinionated journalism- its too politically motivated, intolerant and eventually turns into some sort of dark cult like they have in UK. Objective analysis is whats lacking in the Indian media, intolerant journalism turns into activism.

                            very few press in india is free. They are probably free of govt clutches for all practical purposes but they are highly imprisoned to two things.<br/><br/>
a) how to be copy cat of the US media <br/>
b) corporate greed of the owners.<br/><br/>
These two are the most important traits of our free press. journalists are today slaughtered like goats at the altar of both these demigods which characterize our press.

                            Dear Writer, we all are aware how cash loaded news orgs are. This is a age of creating news rather showing what is news worthy. If everything converts to revenue generating machines and job creating machines its purpose gets diluted. India and world around needs to be less aspirational and learn to find ways to be more sustainable. Your write up btw is juvenile, but you have the freedom of speech people like us do not...

                            It is very painful to watch TV these days. Last few days 90% of  TV coverage is Salman Khan court case. It is impossible to accept that this large country doesn't have any news other than a single inconsequential story. Pl do introspect.

                            Madam, prior to May26 2014 everything was good for you. Now all of sudden freedom of journalism is in danger, how? You should also know the fact that in present day people are more aware than you regarding the facts &amp; findings. As you &amp; your media houses always screams,let the people judge which NEWS is real &amp; which is paid?

                            Yes. But, journalism, just like the Govt. or companies must be regulated! You can not give free hands to the journalists, especially considering their immense power and past cases such as Radia Tapes, Jindal sting! Recently, Indian media created so MUCH chaos in Nepal during the rescue operations that the locals got SICK of them.. ! Yes, free speech and media are important, but thre should be regulations in place.

                            media freedom is as about as good right now than it has ever been under any govt. previously. Its not perfect but acceptable. Your anger at 'presstitutes' and other wordss suggest that either you are completely ignorant of how your profession works in real life or you are complicit in it. Wake up, common people have realized how this game is played.

                            Free media doesn't mean intrusive paparazzi, trying to make news of nothing, twisting facts to sensationalise, behaving like presstitutes and shouting and screaming on TV. Media needs to be regulated by an independent regulator. Most media doesn't care when they destroy people's reputation for trp's and readership.

                            TV followed the path with deeper values,great attachment ,and with wide outreach.It aired good and bad news and in course of time became an integral part of humans' life.As it has come to age it is being confronted with hurdles,censorships,interference from corridors of power and even threats from non descript outfits and to cap it all an order to cable operators from local administrations to cut the channels off,if their broadcasts do not suit them.All these<br/>
tendencies are deplorable for an independent media is not only a strong pillar of democracy but is also a force in overall development of society.

                            Media is the fourth pillar of democracy, you are delusional if you believe that most of India's leading media outlets are not tabloids. Media's job is not just reporting, it is to ensure you are actually telling the truth and letting people decide. It is not to create sensationalism, but to create a sense of fairness and truth in the stories. You are the opposition party which works outside the parliament!!<br/>
Corrupt politicians have been thrown out of power, what about corrupt media houses. Do you not have one or two in your own house?<br/>

                            The major problem we have is that the Indian Government, whichever may be the party in power, does not trust the Indian People. This is simply the colonial era mindset at work. It is not only control over the media. Take censorship. Take the police. Take any government office. Take industrial licensing. Take defense production. Take ease of doing business. In any area where the there is an interface between the government and the people, there is a trust deficit on the part of the government. This is the major reason we do not progress. And is at the root of corruption, as the citizen tries to find intermediaries that the government trusts so that he can get his work done. To try and get a ration card, passport or even an election card is a terribly frustrating exercise in India. The plethora of rules and forms will defeat anyone outside the system. Why should getting such simple things done become such herculean tasks? The media has the clout to get its way. What about the Aam Admi? Now you know why the AAP won. The people struck back. It will happen again.
