Headline::::BJP Government, Don't Embarrass India



DateTime::::2015-03-06T15:09:00+05:30



(Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)
	The Government has caused, and is causing, deep embarrassment to India worldwide with its ridiculous campaign to ban a BBC documentary on specious grounds.
	I haven't seen "India's Daughter," Leslee Udwin's film on the tragic rape-murder two years ago of J****, euphemistically dubbed Nirbhaya. With YouTube having been coerced into removing the film from that site, I am unlikely to be able to see it now. But my arguments relate to issues of principle and policy, not to the merits of the film. After all, bad or mediocre films are screened every day in India. What justifies a ban?
	I have read the few reasonable objections to the film. Some are legal: that such a film would prejudice the appeals process and the accused's case for a mercy petition. (Judges can weigh that consideration on merits, but it does not seem to me an overwhelming one, given the saturation coverage the case has already had in our media.) Some are moral: that no one should give a media platform to someone guilty of such a heinous crime. (That's worth debating, but the choice is that of the film-maker and the organization that chooses to screen her work - just as we are all free not to watch it.)
	But the government's and the ruling party's arguments are, frankly, a disgrace. We have the Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Venkaiah Naidu, delivering the mother of all political cliches: "This is an international conspiracy to defame India." The BJP's Meenakshi Lekhi protests that "this will certainly affect tourism." The 'this" she refers to is the film, not the reports of previous rapes of tourists, nor the advisories issued by every Western country warning female tourists against travelling alone or after dark in India. Home Minister Rajnath Singh's statement invokes "the dignity of women" and fulminates that the Government "will not allow any attempt by any individual, group or organization to leverage such unfortunate incidents for commercial benefit." The restraining order obtained by the authorities against the BBC specifically states that one of the accused, Mukesh Singh, "had made offensive and derogatory remarks against women, creating an atmosphere of fear and tension with the possibility of public outcry and law and order situation."
	In sum: it's not the fact or prevalence of rape in India (particularly, if I may be allowed to point out, in north India, not so much the south or the north-east of our culturally diverse land) that bothers the government. It's not even the persistence of offensively misogynistic attitudes across the establishment, also brought out in the documentary, where aside from Mukesh Singh's assertion that his victim was asking for it, his lawyers put the onus for rape squarely on women's behaviour, clothes and social freedoms (one of them even declares that he would douse his daughter or sister with petrol and set her alight if she "engaged in pre-marital activities"). No, it's not the truth of such attitudes and practices in our country that upsets the government. It is, instead, that if this truth were shown by the BBC, India would be disgraced and tourists wouldn't visit our country.
	This is exactly the attitude we witnessed half a century ago when Satyajit Ray was condemned by Nargis and others for showing India's poverty to the west in his masterpiece, Pather Panchali. It wasn't our poverty that shamed us, but its depiction to the outside world. On that issue, fortunately, the Congress government of the day didn't ban Ray's work. It understood that truth is its own justification and that we need mirrors turned on us to understand ourselves better. History has shown that such self-examination has only made the world better.
	The horrific rape was the cause of nationwide protests and media outrage, calling for change in our society's attitudes towards women that underlie crimes like rape. How can we bring about that change if we don't see and share the reality around us and bring people together to transform that reality for the better? We can bring in any change only if we understand the roots of the problem we want to change; if not, we will continue to be its victims. Awareness is the first essential step towards transformation.
	But our government, as usual, prefers to brush reality under the carpet; ignore the message and shoot the messenger. The home of the BBC co-producer in Delhi is ringed by police; the order of an Indian court is sought to be imposed on the freedoms of other societies; people worldwide are decrying the thin-skinned intolerance of a supposedly democratic government. And of course, far more people are rushing to see the film than would have been the case if the Indian Government hadn't reacted with such childish petulance.
	So the Government's intolerance has actually been self-defeating: they have brought about the national disgrace they claimed they were trying to prevent. It was less than a year ago that that our television screens were flooded with BJP election advertisements in which a female voter called for a BJP government because she wanted to live in a country that would be safe for her daughter. The BJP's campaign cynically exploited the public outrage at crimes against women. But as has become obvious over the last nine months of rhetoric divorced from results, the BJP government cares much more for appearances than reality. Not only has it taken no steps to promote the security of women in India, failing to introduce even better street lighting or more frequent police patrols in the national capital (which it controlled directly under President's Rule), but itsÂ  budgets have cynically ignored women's needs, aside from slogans. In the latest BJP budget delivered by Mr Jaitley, funding for the national rape crisis centres announced last year has been slashed from Rs. 244.48 crore to a mere Rs. 18 crore. That, Mr Rajnath Singh, is a far more unkind cut than any made in the BBC's editing rooms.
	This government certainly doesn't speak for me. Nor does it speak for Badrinath Singh, J****'s father, who openly attacks the patriarchal mindsets of the Indian establishment. "How will we protect our daughters if we don't tell our sons what is wrong and should not be done? Isn't it time to admit that there are both good and bad people everywhere and that certain ways of thinking have led to the death of our daughters?" he asked the BBC. And he added to the Economic Times: "many men, even from good families and with good degrees, seem to think like this. How can our daughters study and work freely if society thinks like this?... We ask parents to treat their daughters as they treat their sons. Educate them but at the same make them strong and, more importantly, teach your sons to respect women."
	This is the kind of wisdom our society sorely needs.A website called The Political Indian lists statements by seven respectable, "mainstream" politicians, many of whom are members of parliament, on women, and they make chilling viewing or reading. The attitudes they reveal to women's place in society and to rape itself are the real problem reflected in the documentary. The BBC shows a defence lawyer saying, "We have the best culture. In our culture, there is no place for a woman." That encapsulates the challenge, and it can only be met by a sustained campaign of education, from childhood onwards, of our boys to make them into real men -- men who respect women.
	The film's contribution lies in making us aware of the mindsets in our midst, the attitudes and ways of thinking that enable and legitimize rape. It is sadly not such a long leap from condemning girls' clothes and believing women's place is in the kitchen and the bedroom, to assaulting them sexually and torturing them with iron rods. The fact that such opinions are widespread, and the dangers they pose, are what the film reveals starkly to us. Rape, remember, is not about sex, but about the violent assertion of power over women. How will denial, or burying our heads in the sand, prevent Indian rapists with such views from claiming new victims? Has a "see no evil" attitude eliminated evil from our country?
	Data released by the office of the Registrar-General of India on Monday shows us the far-reaching effects of the prevalence of our attitudes towards women in our society. Between the last two censuses, the growth in the number of male children born in India was higher, at 5.44 per cent, than the growth in the number of girls born, which was far lower at 4.69 per cent. The sex ratio at birth as a result was slightly worse in 2011 than it was in 2001.We are heading remorselessly towards an "aurat-mukt Bharat".
	The last word should go to Badrinath Singh, the father of India's most famous rape victim. "Our daughter has shown society its true face. She has changed the lives of many young girls. She remains an inspiration even after her death. She fought back those devils. We are proud of our daughter." He tells the BBC his murdered daughter's name means "light ... a light that I wish will dispel whatever darkness there is in this world".
	I appeal to the shame-making BJP government not to snuff out this light again. Even while struggling for life she had spoken to the police in order to pursue justice against her tormentors. Do not brush her courage under the dusty carpet. Let us honour her and confront our own demons within. I don't care what foreigners view or not; there is too much information and disinformation available about India anyway around the world for any one film to make a major difference. It is we Indians who need to see it and be provoked into changing our own society. Let it make us ashamed. Let it make us angry. Let it shame us into changing our society's misogynistic attitudes.
	Let the film be shown.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            There are many good things, for example ancient science,  in India which deserve documentaries and certainly not on rape stories but foreign journalists like to highlight only negative things and why not!! This is how they can easily incite young Indians to waste their energy. Demonising india is very much identical to giving the name of execution capitals of the world to iran and uae, while the number of excecuted people in a powerful county like China is much higher than the total number. See the larger conspiracy. India has always been a soft target but certainly Indians don't need a video made by a foreigner to teach them, educated elders are sufficient to guide youths.

                            @rudresh: Its not about the documentary or Tharoor's opinion. The educated defence lawyers have no respect for women. They don't believe in the Constitution they promised to uphold. The defence lawyer is planning a murder by putting petrol on his daughter. Such mindset has to be punished. Modiji should make an example of those two lawyers for holding regressive views. Indian men should be made to feel ashamed. Men are not something special. They are equal to women. They have to understand that.

                            For congress the only embarrassment is if someone questions Rahul Gandhi's leadership and Robert Vadra's arrogance.  India's pride is not a concern to them. Why is Tharoor who himself is a murderer of a woman  using this case against BJP and finding a political angle to this.

                            What Tharoor sir really meant is "we (Congress) have already Embarrass India so much that there is no room for you to do it". Did you really think that showing the documentary would have made the world praise India? It would have brought more shame to India as foreign media would have painted all Indian males with the same paint as the culprit here. Every media in west would have said every Indian has the same mind set like do not resist while being raped. You need to come out of this Congress mind set - I just feel pitty about you.

I am embarrassed that I am an Indian and shocked by the attitude of the government led by the '56-inch' chested Mr Modi.

                            For all the moronic Aholes on here. Let me get this straight. You are all a disgrace to humanity for making it a BJP V/S Congress thing. You all BJP supporters are a bunch of hooligans trying to stomp your authority on the more liberal minded people of India. Mumbai is under hostage by the BJP now. Even Shiv Sena understands our needs much better and Aditya Thackeray has been making all the right sounds. I supported the BJP and now I am kicking myself, just 9 months into the government, they have resorted to "censoring, banning, imprisoning". <br/><br/>
Congress might be the most corrupt on the face of this earth. They are another bunch of Aholes. AAP is too, just the same. <br/><br/>
However, Congress might be corrupt and India might have progressed slower than it will in the BJP regime but at least we had "FREEDOM OF CHOICE"<br/><br/>
Give me my freedom back. STOP EMBARASSING INDIA on the world stage by banning documentaries. <br/><br/>
Beef ban? Why ban it. I am a HINDU and I like my steak medium rare. Who gave you the right to choose on my behalf? Did we get independence so you elites could command and control me? I am just honestly so angry that I would never return to India. EVER. EVER.

Congress started something - partition, divide and rule, bifurcate in the name of re organisation- language non development and many more Which embarrassed us worldwide for far to long that my generation took it for granted and became subservient to on an all countries on any topic. Hell even Maldives and Sri Lanka embarrass us courtesy 50 year of Nehru ,and Gandhis _ 10 years of MMS rule. Even then I do not agree to the ban of this documentary- it should be shown period.

                            Dear Mr. Tharoor how could you write on the ban if you haven't seen the documentary? Please Google and there are many active links where you can watch the documentary. I am not supportive of the ban or BJP. The only problem I see is that the documentary exposes wrong views on women through comments made by defence Lawyers and Mukesh himself. While an educated society would conceive the message I am sure there would be many in India who would uphold the wrong views made by the lawyers despite educated or not.

                            It is simple all the accused rapists are upper castes. The prime accused are of the same caste as the home minister of India. These guys do not want the real truth about their community to get out, hence their attempt to stifle the BBC's doxentary

                            Have you checked the following allegations -<br/>
1) The inmate was Paid by the documentary maker<br/>
2) The condition, that the entire recording was to be shown unedited to the Jail Authority, was not followed. <br/>
3) The inmate were interviewed as a research project &amp; that's what was given in  writing to the authority.<br/>
4) The Film was sold to BBC<br/>
These need a debate if found true.<br/>
The intentions behind making the film may not be as PURE SINCERE &amp; HONORABLE as they are made out to be.

                            Those who want the ban are people who don't care if the dirt and filth remains. Only it should not be seen. Appearances are important. For these people what you show about yourself is more important that what you are. <br/><br/>
The tragedy is, Indian politicians are like the Emperor who fools himself to believe no one can see him... Naked. When actually everyone does  see his nakedness but is merely silent and pretending. <br/><br/>
Once in a way a  little boy comes into the scene and shouts "the emperor is naked!" We are right now facing one such moment.

As far as this hypocrisy of "public awareness", a public that has created the "mahan bharat" is quite "aware" of itself. Now what it does about it is another question. Elects a bunch of criminals to parliament and then cries, "oh politicians are so corrupt", excuse me, we ARE a DEMOCRACY, so stop making moronic middle eastern excuses, all of us including you...you know pushing a woman to the brink of suicide, that counts as "misogynistic attitude" too!

                            Government's decision to ban the documentary is absolutely correct. This documentary indeed showing the truth, has emphasized on the views of the rapist and his lawyers. The views of the rapist and his lawyer are portrayed like view of majority in India which is not true.<br/>
Moreover, the documentary is very insensitive lacks feeling of responsibility towards the society. It tries to send negative message to the society that women should rather not oppose such heinous crimes against themselves if they want their lives to be saved.<br/>
People in favor of telecast of this documentary should actually feel embarrassed as this gives totally wrong picture of India and how our society thinks of Women.

                            This film does not do good to common mass who can be influenced negatively by the views produced by lawyer and rapist. It is not an issue for an intellect but a possible problem for society. However we should be concerned that there is no change in law and order situation, no education on mentality towards women and above all no decision on fate of those rapist. Do we need film to raise our conscience or for passing the time.

we have to change our mindset and typical male mentallity in India. world is connected through all forms of communication we cannot stop information from flowing.Governement should bring laws for speedier resolve of crimes against women.

                            I am not sure what the congress would have done if they were in power. The film should not be banned and the real shame is for the nation when such heinous crimes against women and girl children happen. India is already defamed due to such crimes and banning the movie wont help reduce that. Instead of taking such steps, the govt and the parliament( where Mr Tharoor also belongs) should make effective steps to prevent such crimes. Ban is a regressive step and political accusations as above are not helping either

This makes India as a poor country, shameless country and this shows clearly that to defame India the foreign media has taken this step.  Govt. did the right thing to BAN the film.  In fact Govt. should have acted fast and at the time of Interview itself, they should have ben aware of and should have stopped at that time itself.  BANNINg is a must and at most wanted action.

The documentary is real face of our society [not everyone] and it will certainly help at least educated people and family who knowingly or unknowingly deprived girls or women rights as their rigid and baseless thinking. I was shocked how from top to bottom [judiciary-policeman] Note [not everyone] including society and family do support such thought process and attitude. Its time not to get angry but stop people not do such thing when and where we get change around us. We are seeing protest everywhere in India because there is a new class of people who doesn't support such belief and we need to increase these number day by day...............................<br/>

                            I defer with what our well known and educated Ex-minister has to say on the ban. The heinous crime is first and foremost associated with 6 culprits and 2 victims. Your plea to remove the ban will surely hurt the sentiments attached with the victim and the family members related. The dreadful night has Scarred memories of the one who survived ,Mr. Pandey. One has no right to project the act though in form of documentary to public without seeking his consent and if it has happened we must not allow it either. I would like to pose  two questions to him:<br/>
first, Being a resident of Mumbai i had strong disrespect to then govt's decision,not to have hanged Qasab in public. why wasn't this done? Just because of same reasons to not put India into shame and follow law and order! <br/>
second : What if a documentary on murder of your late wife Sunanda Pushkar be made with accusations on you as well? <br/>
Point here i make is not to support the current govt. but to make you realise that time is to think with a perspective that is conscience based and not just a political agenda of putting the ruling Govt.'s decisions at false. Its a vicious cycle Mr. Tharoor and now we Indian's are pissed off with such attitude.<br/>

                            The west has achieved its objective. See, Indians already are fighting among themselves rather than uniting and fighting against them. It is just like when the lion attacks, the wild beasts just runs in fear rather than uniting and defending. This culture is what India needs to change.<br/>
I am totally appalled by Leslie Udwin's action to release the name and picture of Jyothi, the rape victim, when her parents who trusted her and specifically requested her not to do it. She betrayed their trust. How is she to be trusted when she claims she has sympathy for the women of India? Shame on the women of India for believing her and letting her get away. Also if she is honest she should stay in India and defend herself in the court. She just flew away to England knowing she will be arrested. If he has sympathies for the Indian women, then she should stay with them and fight for them.

It may take decades and the most horrible criminal among them will be released into the community within a couple of years because he is a minor. You will want to blame foreign media for this as well? I don't think you have seen the documentary. First look at it and then judge others. Instead of facing the real serious problem and solving it Indian government and people like you want to blame foreign media for showing you the mirror. I don't see any hope of improvement till the criminals keep getting support as you are giving. Many girls get raped every day in India but none gets as much coverage as did Nirbhaya case even in Indian media. Who is to blame for it? Foreign media?

That India, a country that worships goddesses can treat their women in such a dastardly manner, begs all of us to do some serious introspection. We are all collectively responsible. All women, mothers in particular, train your sons to respect their sisters and all girls. The ones who need public lynching are the lawyers and one goon in particular. They are a disgrace to India. They bring disrepute to their profession. They were given an international platform and what do they project? The parents carry themselves with dignity but the disgraceful lawyers - why are they running free in society?

We are always concerned what will the world think when we keep telling the world ours us a superior culture and then seen in such a light. We are not bothered what's wrong with us and how to fix it . We spend our time in cover ups. We are quick to find out others fault.Agen Bola Agen Taruhan Bola Agen Sbobet

                            Me.tharoor plz don't embarrass Indians just bcoz u want to escape urself from ur wife's murder case and for that u want to bring pressure on the ruling party by tightening the noose wherever possible, the video or documentary is not great or message oriented Infact it's portraying indians in a very bad light which is dangerous for any society to have half of the people in the negative side.
