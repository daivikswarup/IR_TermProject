Headline::::On JNU Arrest, Delhi Police Is On Thin Ice



DateTime::::2016-02-18T22:29:00+05:30




                                Policing the world's largest democracy of over a billion people with myriad castes, creed, colour, language, age, gender, beliefs, status, needs, history is like striving to win a "Mahabharata" almost daily.
Every day, the cops need Lord Krishna on their side.
Because every day, Indian Security Forces - Civil Police, Special Armed Forces, or the Olive Greens, Blue or White, are facing rising external challenges which are determined to weaken India's accelerating economic growth and growing influence around the world.
With a free and competitive media airing 24x7 views, sometimes well-informed, at times partial and judgemental, heat can sometimes be generated among the public. This further fuels the news and the cycle goes on. The intention behind such news is both authentic as well exaggerated. A lot depends on the manner in which it is expressed and projected or even interpreted.
Such are the increasing, extraordinary challenges for Policing in this country today of "a billion views".
Indian policing is not the same as it was few decades ago. There is a wholesale change. It still ranges from tackling minor crimes like the loss of goats of the poor to the now lethal proxy war attempting to overthrow our elected governments by attacking the temple of Indian Democracy, the Indian Parliament and more.
Police persons recruited years ago and senior in age, and others young and recently appointed who are first responders, work with no fixed hours of duty or right to leave. They are at times unarmed and not even fully equipped with latest technology.
Every arrest the police makes in dealing with a law and order situation is a decision which is fraught with its unique consequences dependent on who the police has arrested. A known VIP or an influential community member? Or from an organised unionised body?
To arrest or not arrest in any situation, including a volatile one, demands maturity and strong sense of justice.
Let me take up the JNU case: the arrest of Kanhaiya Kumar, President of the All India Students Federation on a complaint lodged by a Member of Parliament, Shri Mahesh Giri. For the student, the case is made out on seditious acts as per the section 124 A of the Indian Penal Code. Which is as follows:
'Whoever, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection toward the government established by law in...shall be punishable with life...'
Kanhaiya's arrest has caused a huge divide on the basis of widespread airing of acrimonious debates through all sorts of platforms. Was it seditious? Should he have been arrested?
The answers have been yes, and no.
I believe what we need to understand is the registration of an FIR under sections of law is changeable. For instance, in many cases, a heinous crime becomes less heinous based on the investigation and evidence available. Murder becomes culpable homicide not amounting to murder, or a rash and negligent act etc.
Kanhaiya's arrest can become linked to non-seditious charges dependent on the assessment of evidence by the courts. The job of the police is to investigate and place the matter before the courts to judge. The police registers and collects evidence, then chargesheets based on proof.
The police being criticized or verbally accused of a hasty arrest may be a group's perspective, but when such voices get louder, it spreads serious mistrust.
My personal concern is why not explain the law alongside to balance?
The courts, before extending police custody, examines the evidence and satisfies itself the need for more time for the police to question the accused. Or the courts can throw out the case right in the beginning and discharge the accused.
Now a bit on what happened inside the courts. The question being asked is: "Why were lawyers not arrested for the disruption and attacks?" The "Police is going soft or being pressured," were some allegations.
To this the Police Commissioner BS Bassi has repeatedly said that he did not want to escalate the situation at court at that time. He wanted to minimise collateral damage. He knew all of the attackers were getting recorded. His investigating team can always go back to that evidence, which is strongly admissible.
The point being made is that he chose a lesser evil.
By doing this, the issue of advocates' misbehaviour has remained between courts, advocates and the Bar Council. We wait to see how many are served notices of contempt of court. And how many will have their licenses suspended.
I believe that if the arrests of lawyers had been made from the premises of the courts, the issue would have become Advocates vs Police, with the former demanding a judicial probe into use of force by the police, which would definitely have been needed as no arrest in such a situation can take place without it.
I believe the police has walked on very thin ice in the JNU case. It has gone by the law. Investigation will reveal more and sections of law will be applicable accordingly. The courts will have access to evidence and will rely on the wisdom of past judgements. But always remember that each case is unique in its own way.
I am of the view that many recent happenings in educational institutes can be prevented if they have a system of regular communication in place that is open and confidential. As early interventions will be like stitches in time to save nine.
Politicians could then focus more on developmental politics.
But I wish to say in conclusion that this country needs to make better investments in systems of early prevention in educational institutions, legal rights and responsibilities. Also, on policing, take all possible measures which restore trust. Have more courts which expedite trials, so that certainty of punishment becomes a deterrent.Kiran Bedi is the first woman to have joined officer ranks of Indian Police Service.

                            Madam, if lawyers can take law into their hands and police just sits behind the excuse that they don't want to escalate the situation is absurd. Job of the police is to protect the people and uphold the law. The Delhi police in this case did neither. Hence Delhi police is equally guilty of breaking the law and dereliction of duty. If you think that later the Delhi Police will take care of the goon lawyers, then you're dreaming. What ever happens the law must be upheld. And i'm sorry to say, Delhi Police Failed Miserably. No wonder we have seen so many cases of crime happening and the police personnel just stand there and watch. They have definitely forgotten the oath they took.

                            Ma'm with due respect, your Opinion has been a lot of jargon without taking a stance. What is puzzling is that you think it is ok for Police to leave the matter of Lawyers' violence in their very own court premises, supposed to be temples of justice for common man, as a matter to be left between Bar Council, courts and Lawyers. But for students, it seems you think its ok for Police to swoop in and terrorize students and arrest some of them for shouting a few slogans on their campus, that somehow in your opinion did not qualify as a matter to be left for Students Union and University administration to sort out?

                            Agree that law &amp; applicable IPC sections should take it course. But what about the Social Media, Brainless supporters and some TV channels already declaring an arrested person a traitor, Anti-national and terrorist even before the charges are proven. There lies the biggest danger (to someone's life actually) of the present!

                            It is the toughest job in the world, without doubt, made all the more difficult by political interference. Add indeed, all the factors mentioned, creed etc. If the law itself is suspect, then is it time to remove sedition from the statute books. If not, then this sort of situation is likely to arise again and again. We know that Hafeez Sayeed calls for destruction of India and freedom for Kashmir almost every other day. The JNU and voice from other campuses is shouting the same as the LeT man. Why is one wrong and the other right? Other than one sits across the border and the others are within India. You as a police woman must know better then most, once you have reached a point where you harbour such resentment and hate towards your very own, it is not going to take much to push you to the other side. This is well known. If inaction on the part of say, UK authorities is analysed, they ignored such voices for a long time hoping they would go away. They did not. The voices turned into action and not just against the UK. Many of those guys joined terrorists across the border.

                            What if the guy assaulted had died? Would the police still say that the murderer is to be disciplined by the Bar council? Won't the police be complicit in murder? This is the height of 'I don't care' attitude. At least as a human being won't someone intervene when a group assaults a hapless guy? Or does the human instincts die when one joins the police force?

If Khassi is not able to perform his duty with honesty and doesn't have right ideas to control situations then he is not fit to be there. Khassi - the head of goons in uniform - should be sacked and all his medals should be withdrawn and discharged from duty with utmost disgrace.

Never knew after leaving anti-corruption movement and joining BJP, her thoughts will become so corrupt. I don't think this is the real Kiran Bedi we knew, who is now justifying inaction of police when the innocents were beaten by goons in front of their eyes.

Why mr Bassi said in an interview that nothing happend .<br/>
Why Mr Bassi is hyper active on AAP MLAs<br/>
What happned to claims made by rajnath singh and smrirti irani?<br/>
And what action did police take to stop the same hapening for the second time.<br/>
Answer is known to everybody..but admiting it needs courage.<br/><br/>

                            what a sad commentary from Kiran Bedi.Trying to justify brutal police action against students, and inaction against lawyers?? What is the point of having a senior police commissioner in charge of Delhi, when 5 days after the episode, neither has the police investigated anything or found violence, nor acted against violence of the lawyers. In any case, its shocking and outlandish to think  that a speech by a student can become a threat to a Nation of 1 billion people.

                            Kiran Bedi has got it all wrong in the case of the Patiala court violence committed by lawyers, an MLA and the visible police inaction. Like her political counterparts, she first diverts the issue to the sloganeering at JNU. Whether I support or oppose what happened at JNU is immaterial. The government thought is appropriate to arrest Kanhaiya Kumar and press charges of sedition against him. So far, so good. The government and police have a right to take action as they deem appropriate. Now it is for the police/government to prove his guilt and Kanhaiya Kumar, his supporters and his advocates to prove his innocence in a court of law. That is supposed to be the due course of law and justice in the country, or atleast what I thought it was. It is for the courts to decide and mete out appropriate punishment or otherwise.<br/>
Now before he is produced in court, he is beaten up, his supporters, his advocates, media reporting the events are all beaten up – by a bunch of lawyers and an MLA belonging to the ruling party at the center who also controls the police in the state. Ms. Kiran Bedi talks of ‘collateral damage' and how the police chief Bassi tried to reduce it. This excuse sounds so lame that even Ms. Bedi herself would not believe it. Take the case of the Nirbhaya rapists and murderers. The anger and hatred in the hearts of every citizen across the country was palpable and mobs were waiting to lynch and beat up the accused while they were being taken in and out of court. Still, the police kept their faces covered – no one even knew what the accused even looked like. How is it that the police was very effective in protecting the murderers inspite of the blood-thirsty and righteous mobs? They could have very well allowed the crowds to manhandle the accused and watch as mute spectators in order to avoid ‘collateral damage'. Infact, the people would have praised the police for helping to get rid of such vermin from the society.<br/>
She talks about the challenges for Policing in this country today of "a billion views". Sorry, Ms. Bedi, it is precisely because of these ‘billion views' that police action in the Patiala court case was more necessary than ever. A billion people have now seen that if you shout ‘Bharat mata ki jai' and indulge in violence and arson the police will not touch you. You will suddenly become a ‘Patriot' and a ‘Nationalist'. Moreover, you can do it again and again repeatedly in the same fashion at the same place and become ‘heroes' overnight. And atleast half of those billion viewers now genuinely believe it to be true because of the police complicity and inaction.<br/>
It was the duty of the police to intervene and arrest the lawyers and the MLA who were breaking the law on the spot - in full media glare and public view. That would have sent out the correct message that it is not alright to indulge in violence and take the law into your hands however ‘Nationalistic' your intentions. That message needed to be seen by the billion people, if we are to have a country of law-abiding population. The delhi police in failing to execute their duty have done a grave national disservice and infact have in their way, contributed to future growing lawlessness. <br/>
Ms. Bedi says that if the police had taken action there, the lawyers would have demanded a judicial enquiry into the police action. Now come on, give us a break.  Is speculated judicial enquiry sufficient reason for dereliction of duty in the present? And what if there is a judicial enquiry? If the police action was for the right reasons – to protect law and order and to uphold the law of the land, why do they need to fear a judicial enquiry? They needed to have taken that first action to set the optics and messaging right even if it meant an escalation of the situation to where the army has to be called in. <br/>
The problem today is that the police has become accustomed to ‘avoidance' in the garb of controlling law and order situations, rather than upholding the law, protecting people's rights under the constitution, and taking action against the law breakers. How else do you explain the police lathi charging and rounding up of law abiding people who gather to kiss(!) and spread the message of love, instead of rounding up the opposite set of people who threaten to create trouble if people kiss! This is the height of ridiculousness and this is being perpetrated in the psyche of the citizens daily by police actions or inactions – both in inappropriate direction and measure. Sadly we see this mistake being repeated by the police all over the country every day, which is one of the main reasons we see today in this country, growing brazenness and a dangerous understanding of right and wrong.<br/>
Finally, Ms. Bedi talks of the court and the bar council taking action against the law-breaking lawyers. The court ofcourse needs to book them for contempt of court, the bar council ofcourse needs to debar them from practicing the profession since they do not seem to have gained much from their education.  But these actions are not expected ‘instead of' police action! They have to be ‘in addition to' police action. They are offenders under the IPC, and need to be booked as criminals under the IPC which means police action is immediately and inarguably necessary. <br/>
When lawyers and law makers break the law, it becomes all the more pertinent and necessary to not only take swift action against them, but also to do it in full view of a billion people so that the message goes out loud and clear that no amount of nationalism gives anyone the right to break the law. If Mr. Bassi wants to atone for his sin and set the record straight he needs to address the people of this country through his hated media channels in full view of a billion people, after the arrests, that breaking the law is not alright – even if you are the only last remaining nationalist in this country.

                            Its seriously laughable to hear such a distinguished and accomplished public servant to offer comments like "police force wanted to minimize collateral damage and since events were being recorded police could go back and do their investigation". So should we do away with much of the police force and just install cameras everywhere? She also conveniently forgets the police reforms proposed by many committees now and again that general policing and investigation should be two different arms of law and should not be under political oversight. Any reasonable person would find the chain of events absurd. A Govt. MP lodges a complaint, police comes in to action and arrest the student leader without any proof or evidence. Hell, now they say they wouldn't even oppose his bail. Which means, we don't need him custody anymore.<br/><br/>
And, the stupid definition of sedition was carved out by British rulers. Does it make any sense to say 'Whoever, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection toward the government established by law in...shall be punishable with life...' in a democratic nation? Forget this is the definition of sedition in Indian law, the definition is nothing less than what someone like hitler want.

                            Dear Kiran Bedi jee,<br/><br/>
After a nice &amp; big background in the start of your opinion/blog finally you spoke about matter, thanks but still unfortunately the real issue is missed in your blog. I wondered, weather you really missed the real point or you conveniently overlooked so that you can be within reach of political system.<br/><br/>
You have shared that <br/>
"The police being criticized or verbally accused of a hasty arrest may be a group's perspective, but when such voices get louder, it spreads serious mistrust."  <br/><br/>
OR   <br/><br/>
"Why were lawyers not arrested for the disruption and attacks?"<br/><br/><br/>
Well these issues are debatable and for sure one can has a view on this side or the other side... but are these real issues? Not sure if you are confused or smiling?<br/><br/>
Well the real issue is why couldn't police protect people from being attacked in side court premises &amp; inside court room?<br/><br/>
Attackers are lawyers or liars or outsiders, that's not a concern ... concern is that are people safe in court premises &amp; in court room? Please let me re-phrase it, are people in police custody safe in court room? or police is going to say - well it's thin ice, we want to avoid confrontation?<br/><br/>
If you really want to have improved version of any thing including police behavior / and services; you need to educate &amp; train the people in the system; and so that you can educate people who are part of system, you need to tell them deficiencies shown by them. You have not raised the mistake done, how can you expect them to improve? Instead you have tried to create thin ice between debatable issues &amp; their deficiency. Well you can't hide deficiencies behind thin ice of debatable issues.... <br/><br/>
Last question, are you on politician's side or on policing side ... trust me you can't be on both sides.... God bless you..

                            Police has taken action as per law. Courts are the real masters and they are the one of the pillars of democracy. I think court would act as per the constitution and do well.  Criticising Police force is easy. For example in Tamilnadu in the last regime, we faced two situation of the same kind. <br/><br/>
1. Chennai Ambedkar Law college which is situated inside the highcourt premises, two students were attacked by group of students and police did not intervene in the incident as they felt law needed a permission from Principal for taking action.  But unfortunately one of the two students got permanently physically handicapped due to that.  Now JNU action has prevented that kind of situation.<br/><br/>
2. In the same Chennai again during the last regime Lawyers have agitated within the premises of High Court and attacked every one.  Police intervened and took serious steps to contain the situation. But the Honourable Justices of the High Court have not supported the action and this led to the enquiry and punishment of the concerned police personnel.  <br/><br/>
In both the incidents Police has taken opposite view to the current view. But they were criticised by Media and Public.  I think we as a matured democracy should accept that certain aberrations are bound to happen (including JNU incident, police action) and know how to deal with them without arising the passions. So many innocent people were arrested by Police and so many time courts have come down heavily on the police force and still system is like that and we cannot punish police for maintaining law and order.

                            Dealing with lawyers is a different ball game. <br/>
even lathi charging those lawyers would have resulted in blood bath in the court premises. It is a fact that no police force(of any state) would take action against lawyers, it hasnt happened earlier, it may not happen in the future.<br/>
We Indians need a govt like in china..we never realize the value of the freedom we have

                            Delhi Police is not managing billions of Indians and the populations is not as diverse as NewYork, San francisco, HongKong, Paris. Dont give undue credit to Delhi police. They are just puppets and wasooli guys at best.<br/>
It's unfortunate Kiran Bedi you have lost all the respect in one year that you had heard over your life time of service. Thats a shame!!

                            you talk about prevention, however the level of prevention for you starts at the policing level.  Its not unexpected however, since you do have a huge policing bias. Based on your comments the Answer to most of the problems would be better policing. <br/>
Do you really want india to be a police state? <br/>
What about freedom of expression? is the fabric  or foundation of our nation so thin that a speech in delhi by young students would have tragic consequences.? Why are we even following a british law that was meant for a colonial rule and not a democracy which should promote peace and freedom and not persecution. <br/>
Didn't the police think about the lesser evil before barging into JNU? It seems you use an argument when it suits you?<br/>
You are pretty correct regarding the complexities that police face, have you ever understood the complexities that a common man or a student face. <br/>
People say - Even if kanhaiya Kumar did not say those ghastly slogans, he did not do anything about it, didn't excuse himself or "police" the accused?<br/>
Is it fair to not only expect but demand of a person with no policing power to police people in his university or meeting, but give a clean check to police to let the lawyers break the law. Even If I agree with you, how come lawyers and MPs get a show cause notice while a Student gets arrested. Why didn't the police arrest the lawyers at their home, or when the halla ended. How come a MP gets charged and bailed the same day, while Kanhaiya sent to jail. I understand most of these questions will have technical reasons such as different cases require different approaches. However to an outsider like me this just looks UNJUST. <br/>
Do you want out next generation to be do things because they are scared of law, or to have a better understanding of whats right or wrong and have more intrinsic reasons for not doing those things?

                            Liberty plucking at the nose of justice,as Shakespeare wrote many centuries ago,can cause all decorum to go athwart.That's what has happened in India.And I choose to blame our politics for it.Strikes and agitations that are unruly and demeaning to human dignity by perverse demonstrations like lying down on roads and railway tacks and e'en violent at times.Is this how we are supposed to express our dissent in a democracy?Our politics,public life and e'en civil life-yes,we have egged the politicians on by not demanding behavior that merits their offices and have just as gladly chosen to be as lax and ill-behaved as the leaders- needs a heavy dose of discipline.Perhaps the time is ripe for the politicians to have a code of conduct or a charter of some sort that binds 'em to conduct 'emselves properly.Leaders have to set an example.Then maybe the lawyers,student union leaders and the rest of the lot will follow suit.

                            Madam is wholly wrong in ststing the crux of the issue. Lawyers, supposedly took law into their hands and the Temple of Justice had nothing to tell us the common citizens. The Police Commissioner cannot say that he did not want to escalate the situation. It is hos job to book offenders and ensure peace. Not booking offenders is not a choice. The whole incident and the response is a shame on the  judicial system, the police,and the administration. Madam Kiran Bedi should stop thinking like a small time police officer and start thinking like a leader. She will win electionsif sge can develop that ability. Ashok

                            Its important to understand how we behave like Herds of Sheep. We always view the world by spectacle of Culture, Class and upbringing we have been brought by. I am viewing many comments, Likes and dislikes on various News site. Herds of Sheep who belong to Congress/Left/AAP are in huge numbers commenting on NDTV. Now why they are on this site. As NDTV Feeds them what they want i.e. Anti BJP Food. Similarly Herds of Sheep who support BJP Like India TV, ZEE NEWS, as they feed them what they like Support BJP. And these Sheeps feed their ego by giving likes dislikes comments on their repective stable. But the fact is Herd of Sheep who oppose BJP forget that its an elected Government selected by majority of people by a system called democracy. Now some people will argue only few people vote bla bla bla. But the Real problem is within ourselves which is supremely exploited by parties as well as News Channel. Introspect.

It is easy to criticise, but in a political high wattage area like Delhi the police should be supported for doing a thankless job to the best of their abilities. Take Bassi's case. He was pilloried for no fault of his and lost a chance to become an Information Commissioner. What did he get in return? Abuse? Kirn Bedi left in a huff when she was overlooked as Delhi Police Commissioner. Made a complete mess of the BJP's election campaign in Delhi. Now she casts pearls of wisdom on the waters.

We have heard  so many people say regarding the JNU event that   - ... don't support the slogans ...but ... don't support the police action. Seems to me the police and administration are between a rock and a hard place.<br/><br/>
There is no question that swift justice  must be  meted out to   the BJP MP and The offending lawyers -  But the role of media and politicians in the disturbances should not be underestimated.

If you really think he is innocent and you have enough evidence then go help Kanhiya in court of law rather than doing personal bashing here.

                            Agree with you Kiran Bediji. Police has a tough job with all discredit by politicians and public as well. But police  and army are the only groups where they are perfectly secular as per my observation. Than why not politicians ? but again it is all-out power race and that inspires them to do everything and anything. Why we allow student associations to be tool of political parties ? we must try to keep university campus education and cultural activities centric only. It is responsibility of university authority to create safe atmosphere and must not allow outsiders and for that need to check photo ID also need to have CCTV cameras in campus at all places. So prevention is better than cure . Curing treatment has  serious side effects also.

                            Ma'm, But why to arrest without the evidence having been weighed in? Arrest should succeed the evidence not precede it - especially when the bail can not be given by the Metropolitan court (it will be the competence of Session court) where the accused is being produced. The speech by the accused which I have seen on the youtube is nowhere closer to sedition. In fact, he clearly repudiates the slogans raised earlier and reaffirms his faith in constitutionalism !

It was apparent that they were there with the sole intent of beating up the victim, yet Mr. Bassi chose not to arrest them since it was the "lesser of the to evils". Oh C'mon. A persons physical being was being harmed by thugs and goons and the cops chose to ignore them for their "connections" and their own political paymasters. Give us a break Ms. Bedi and stop preaching and sermonizing. You are just full of it.

                            Mrs Bedi. I've always had immense respect for your views but your defence of the current dispensation hardly stands up to scrutiny. In all fairness Mr Bassi has brought this upon himself. For someone who professes at the drop of a hat to be the upholder of law in the capital, who doesnt think twice before putting into jail sitting MLA and ministers of the Delhi govt on the most minor pretexts, who is happy to book a young student on a serious charge of sedition. For such an officer to be seen to be choosing "the lesser evil" when dealing with a set of hoodlums who have been caught in the act on the camera of the nation's media, not just once but twice is certainly not the best defence he could have put up. He has gone out of his way to demonstrate his loyalty to his political masters at the centre but this time, I am afraid, has gone a wee bit too far. I am afraid in the India of today there arent too many places to hide when an officer of the law decides to play partisan politics

The problem has been that every political party has tried to draw mileage out of the event esp Mr Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi. They did the same at Hyderabad... added no value whatsoever but created more disturbance than before.<br/><br/><br/>
Its time we ask ourselves - Should Education should be separated from politics ?? Its pity to see Mr Kumar who comes from a humble background (don't know how much struggle it is for his parents to educate him) being caught up in such a matter.

                            Being first woman to have joined officer ranks of Indian Police Service, does not mean she is any less duffer. I never imagined so until I got to hear some of her sound bytes in Delhi elections.

                            Today they want Kashmir then khalistan then Bengal then Kerala tamilnadu jharkhand. U keep bowing to this coz that's why u got converted first. Those of weak minds instead of being proud of what they r born or brought up gets converted to this what u r now navtej and then they wish others to be mindless zombie like urself
