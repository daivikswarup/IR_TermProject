Headline::::How Nawaz Sharif's Call To Modi Went Down In Pak



DateTime::::2016-01-07T20:20:00+05:30




                                On Christmas Day, supporters of a peaceful, normal and prosperous South Asia region were buoyed by the surprise visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Lahore on his way back from his travels to Moscow and Kabul. At the time, many Indians and Pakistanis felt that enthusiasts on both sides of the border were getting ahead of themselves. The images of an Indian Prime Minister embracing a Pakistani leader on the tarmac have a lot of symbolic power, but long, warm embraces between Modis and Sharifs won't solve Kashmir, they won't solve the Mumbai 26/11 case, and they won't resolve Sir Creek or Siachen. The troublesome thing about cynics is that they tend, in this region especially, to be right.
 
Criticizing symbolism in South Asia is a strange preoccupation - we, the subcontinent of over 1.5 billion mostly deeply religious people, thumbing our noses at symbols? The irony may be unmistakable. Yet, reducing the recent bonhomie between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and PM Modi as mere symbolism is also plainly inaccurate. The reactions of the Pakistani and Indian governments to the Pathankot terrorist attack prove, once again, that more interaction between the two countries is better than less.
Conventional wisdom about the motives for the Pathankot attack is that peace and normalization between India and Pakistan will generate rents for all groups in the region except the ones that thrive on conflict: principally, non-state actors based in Pakistan whose bread and butter is India-hatred. The theory is that by perpetrating a terrorist attack so soon after a highly successful albeit symbolic meeting between the leaders of the two countries, non-state actors could manipulate the bilateral dynamic and possibly cause delays or even termination of the detente process.
For this theory to work, India has to react to terrorist attacks on Indian soil-that it believes originate in Pakistan-by ceasing whatever conversations it is engaged in with Pakistan. For years, Indian and Pakistani leaders have sought to undermine this theory by what Mani Shankar Aiyar calls a process between the two countries that needs to be "uninterrupted, and uninterruptable".
 
There is, of course, a pretty serious flaw in the theory too. The theory can only really be tested across multiple terrorist attacks. No one could possibly want that. If the terrorists decide to relentlessly stage one attack after another, for example, even the most hard-core adherents to the talks process would find the pressure to suspend or terminate talks between the two countries to be irresistible.
 
Enter PM Modi and PM Sharif. The Paris COP21 sideline coffee table conversation, the truly out-of-the-box NSA meeting in Bangkok, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj's attendance of the Heart of Asia conference in Islamabad and the Christmas love-in in Lahore were not reactions to terrorism or hardliner-pressure. After many years, the bilateral relationship had been supercharged by two men with a boldness and vision that inoculates the two countries from sudden reactions to events.
 
The conventional wisdom lens suggests that the Pathankot terrorist attack is meant to disrupt the bilateral relationship, possibly, even to poison it-certainly, after the Mumbai attacks in 2008, war between India and Pakistan was palpable. This approach to processing or analyzing the Pathankot attack privileges the agency of whichever terrorist group was behind the attack. It not only makes such terrorist groups party to the relationship between two nuclear power states, but in fact elevates such terrorist groups to the level of arbiters of the relationship.
 
I would argue that the Pathankot attack needs to be seen for what it really is: a desperate attempt by terrorists to try to affect a process that has already achieved more in a couple of months than the terrorists can achieve in years of planning. When seeing the Pathankot attack from this lens, we can see that "symbolically" improved bilateral relationship has allowed both countries some relatively unprecedented space in reacting to the attack.
 
In India, Prime Minister Modi's use of the term "enemies of humanity" to describe the terrorists behind the Pathankot attack was widely seen as a concession of sorts to Pakistan-showing that he was not willing to jump to conclusions about the source of the attack. In Pakistan, the Foreign Office's almost immediate statement condemning the attack and reiterating the country's offer to support India in pursuing a response to the attack was seen as a change from the oft-hesitant Pakistani establishment in engaging India on issues related to terrorism.
 
Perhaps most importantly, Prime Minister Sharif's January 5 phone call to his Indian counterpart, to personally offer his strong condemnation and support signaled the most impactful by-product of the "symbolic" nature of the relationship between the two leaders.
On Thursday afternoon, soon after returning from a trip to Sri Lanka, PM Sharif chaired a high-level meeting of his security and foreign policy team, with National Security Adviser, Lt Gen (retd) Naseer Janjua and Adviser on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz in the room. The Prime Minister's plate is more than full these days, with an ornery Saudi Arabia and a provocative Iran on one side, and an irate India on the other. As the Saudi Foreign Minister landed in Islamabad, it was India's temper that PM Sharif was busy trying to moderate. It represents a remarkably bold continuation of the Prime Minister's efforts to build and sustain a relationship with his Indian counterpart that makes the bilateral relationship immune to being hijacked by terrorists.  
 
In India, all this may not mean much, but Pakistani hawks have been relentless in their hounding of PM Sharif since he took office. The phone call to PM Modi has given them something fresh to feed on - a sign of weakness and a tacit admission that Pakistan has anything at all that it can do to help India fight terror. This is obviously anathema for the small but vocal crew of Pakistanis that prefer constant bitterness with India over the detente being pursued by PM Sharif.
 
It turns out the symbolism of the handshakes, the long hugs, the saris and chaadars being exchanged, and the mutual admiration of two mama's boys has created the capacity on both sides of the border to absorb the shock and horror of terror. If both leaders can stay the course, answers to Pathankot are not going to be as elusive as we may think, and answers to the bigger riddles, while not around the corner, at least become conceivable once again.

                            Unless you can solve the Kashmir tangle, all these talks etc. are going to be useless. Nehru cost the nation a lot by his very stupid decision for a referendum on Kashmir. He died 50 years ago, but Indians are still dying there. It has been a massive drain on the country. Whether anyone likes it or not, the only way out is to repeal Article 370 and integrate Kashmir fully into India, with each Indian law applicable to it. There is no need to pay too much attention to the sensitivities of Kashmiris, separatists or not. Get it over and done with. Then only can relations with Pakistan normalise. Otherwise they will keep dreaming of annexing Kashmir with the consequent cost to both sides.

                            Mosharraf needs to bear in mind there are malevolent islamic terrorists and benevolent islamic terrorists , the latter operate under the patronage of the deep state of pakistan as part of pakistan's policy in achieving its foreign policy objectives particularly in relation to India and Afghanistan. The jury is very much out on pakistan's intentions in respect of the `benevolent' terrorists. It would be appropriate to point out too that the fundamental threat to pakistan's existence is the fact that pakistan - an historic blunder - is an ideological failure.

                            While, the peace is the only answer to all conflicts, but this will never happen between the two countries. Had that been the case, some action could have been taken against Mumbai attackers in Pakistan. Is there any progress ? No. Why do we live in a fools paradise. No action will be taken this time around as this is just a time buying exercise. What happens if there are multiple attacks in India, say in next 3-4 months; which is quite possible give the factory of militants in Pakistan. <br/>
The only practical solution is that both countries should forget that they are neighbours. Keep low profile and take action in their respective countries to root out militancy. In the next 10 years, India will become an economic superpower and Pakistan too, hopefully should improve its economic situation, if militancy is controlled. The time to engage with Pakistan would be right then.

                            The working peace on the basis of mutual interest between two neighbors is possible, but it will go against the basic purpose of partition itself. The purpose of partition was to preserve the perks and power of Kings and Jamindars. Therefore, King of Kashmir and Nepal refuse to merge with India and powerful Hindu, Muslim ask their respective area to earn their share uninhibitedly. However, democracy in India and Military in Pakistan keep some restriction over them and therefore we have seen some serious political conflicts since partition. Because, conflicts generate poverty and poverty can easily generate militancy. Thus, it become very cheap to use this militancy when and where requires earning money and maintaining power. Basically, this is a very profitable business as on one hand poor blame God for poverty and on other hand rich encourage poverty to maintain money and power. This game of cat and mouse will going on until common people refuse to become victim and control their greed that appears very difficult, but achievable.

                            RSS/BJP Chaddis are talking about Nawaz Sharif as if he is some type of peace loving moderate leader who wants peace with India. Actually he is a right-wing nut just like Modi who is supported by and who supports radical Islamists in Pakistani Punjab. Just because Feku Modi wanted some TV prime-time PR by hugging Sharif doesn't mean RSS/BJP Chaddis should forget that Sharif actually supports terrorists. But RSS/BJP Chaddis will say that the sun rises in the west if FEku Modi says so.

Sir,just a quick question...............what exactly is a non state actor??? just asking, you know.I think people in India are unaware of this term.Can you please throw some light???<br/>
Also note your PM Nawaz Sharif, maybe or positively is,since you say so "a mamas boy". Our PM is no mamas boy.Just keep it in mind. During his Lahore trip,in one masterly stroke he got rid of your entire army,foreign office,NSA and your so called sate and non state actors.Not a single person was present.How????? Give it some thought.

                            Well written. Both countries should continue talks, try to rope in the army chief of Pak to expose his real stand. The JED wants to destabilise good relations, or else they will become redundant. The citizens of Pakistan should be interacted with, on a regular basis that the future of their kids and the overall welfare of the country depends on decent education and values, and not in religious fanaticism. Indians seem to have learnt that and the fanatics in here are in much smaller numbers. They are not as violent as the Pakistani counterparts. The political leadership of all parties in Pakistan should look at long term welfare of its people than trying to get power for personal benefits.

                            Critics of bilateral talks at this background have fallen prey to the terrorists design for abandonment of bilateral talks. How long and what for such talks be avoided and cross border terrorism  be tolerated without decisive actions? For any decisive action towards lasting peace, talks is a must. if afterwards why not now? If peace is to come first, then there won't be any need for talks for peace there after.

                            In my view other than the terrorists there is a big section of the arms industry and the defence/political establishment of both countries that gains from not having a dialogue. With India spending billions of dollars importing arms to keep its borders 'safe' and Pakistan using Zarb e Azb as its excuse for getting arms its the arms industry and their political sponsors in the west that are laughing all the way to the bank while we continue to argue about the symbolisms of reconciliation<br/>
Why would all these interested parties not be keen to see a continuation of the conflict between the two countries. The region virtually keeps the arms industry running

                            Non state actors and wallah wallah is understood. What is not understood then is why not co-operate with India fully and bring them to justice. Instead Pakistani behaviour is opposite, at least in the past. There is no role for non state actors or third parties between India and Pakistan. Control non state actors on your side of the border, co-operate with India to eliminate non-state actors , India should eliminate non state actors who come across the border.
