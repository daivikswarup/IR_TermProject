Headline::::Modi-ji, your acche din are the same as purane din



DateTime::::2016-02-01T16:46:00+05:30




                                At Davos and other forums, India is being showcased as "the world's fastest growing economy". But that's not because we are accelerating; it is because all others, particularly China, are slowing down.  
This column has drawn attention in the past to the statistical sleight of hand that has added about 1.5 per cent to our growth rate by changing the base year and widening the ambit of the sample that gives us the new rate. In effect, therefore, at today's 7 per cent we are either growing at the same 5.5 per cent that UPA-II left us with - or the rate of growth in the year UPA-II demitted office was 7 per cent on the new statistical basis. In other words, the growth rate of GDP is the same in these acche din as it was in the purane din.
For all Arun Jaitley's empty budget boast of taking the economy soaring to 8.5 per cent, we remain where we were - and in some ways much worse off - than before the May 2014 elections. In its halcyon day before the 2008 global financial crisis, Dr. Manmohan Singh and his government had taken us to 9.4 per cent. We could credibly talk of double-digit growth and overtaking China when China was growing at 12 per cent. Today, just maintaining the 7 per cent growth rate (on the new scale) that the BJP inherited would amount to a minor miracle.
This is astonishing considering that when the UPA was in office, crude oil was ruling at well over $100 a barrel, indeed, touching a high of $140. And is today sinking below $30 to around $27 as this column goes online. Instead of cashing in on this bonus, the rupee is floundering at 69 to the dollar, the lowest ever, while the stock market has plummeted to the same level it was at before the Modi bubble blew it upwards to unprecedented heights. Now, reality is taking over.
In the first Modi year, 2014-15, agricultural growth recorded a miserable 1.1 per cent advance. This year, 2015-16, has been worse. I expect the Economic Survey, when it is published later this month, to confirm that agricultural growth has indeed turned negative. While governments can do little to control nature, there are always earthly measures they can take to contain the ill effects on the farmer of monsoon failure or other natural disasters. Indeed, challenge can even be turned into opportunity as Rajiv Gandhi proved by taking up the challenge during the terrible drought of 1987-88, the worst since Independence, through drought relief and drought-proofing measures that resulted in more being spent in devastated Rajasthan in a single year than in all the 40 years since freedom came at midnight. In consequence, the economy not only bounced back but, in 1988-89, recorded the first and last time ever that the economy grew in double digits - 10.87 per cent to be precise. Significantly, dry-land crops like pulses and oil seeds attained in that year their highest output till then.
Rajiv did it by visiting every drought-ridden state in the country, often driving his own car, stopping unannounced by the wayside and spending hours in conversation with the distraught farmers, followed by action-oriented discussions with state ministers and bureaucrats till late into the night. Our present PM has been seen in the exalted presence of all world leaders but never with a living Indian kisan or khet mazdoor or a suicide-driven kisan's family. That is the difference between leading from the front in a crisis, and praying for rain in luxurious foreign hotel suites.         
In the manufacturing sector, there is stagnation. "Corporate profits in relation to GDP," says T.N. Ninan in the Business Standard of January 2016, "are at a decadal low." Infrastructure is in crisis, with power generation growing at less than three per cent, and railways missing their freight traffic targets. So, while the government is busy planning to sell the family silver in order to pay the butler, disinvestment has been so slow and haphazard as to make a mockery of Jaitley's budget targets. In any case, the state of our stock markets is such that this would be quite the wrong time to dispose of invaluable public sector assets in the market.
To revive manufacturing, the government would either have to throw its fiscal deficit targets to the winds and thus threaten macroeconomic stability, or pump up private investment by fiscal stimuli that would unbalance the books and be firmly resisted by the Reserve Bank. In his C.D. Deshmukh lecture last week, Governor Rajan pointed to the consolidated fiscal deficit of the Centre and the States having risen from 7 per cent to 7.2 per cent between Modi's first year, 2014, and Modi's second year, 2015. "So, we actually expanded the aggregate deficit in the last calendar year," he added. He underlined that the consolidated fiscal deficit "is by far the largest among the countries we like to compare ourselves with". Notwithstanding a substantial rise in tax revenues, particularly from (regressive) indirect taxes, fiscal indiscipline has been so rampant that Jaitley's attempts to deride UPA-II's performance on this score have backfired and Modi's new scheme, UDAY (Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana) is going to add such a fiscal burden to states, that the consolidated fiscal deficit is likely to zoom to 7.5 per cent of GDP in the coming 2016-17 fiscal year.
With any significant fiscal stimulus thus ruled out, manufacturing firms will have to turn to the banking system to "Make in India". And the banking sector is in even worse shape than the firms themselves. The highly regarded Swiss research arm of Credit Suisse have estimated that India's ten top borrowers hold between them some Rs. 7.3 lakh crore of bank credit, of which about 40 per cent, or Rs. 3 lakh crore, are regarded as "severely stressed" - which is Bank-lingo for loans that will not be paid back but can be recycled by "ever-greening" (converting outstandings into renewed loans), thus enabling both the firms and the banks to (barely) retain their "good name". This unholy alliance between government, the banking sector and big business (more accurately and damningly known as 'crony capitalism') has broken the link between the RBI's interest rate and commercial banking rates, left banks (especially public sector banks) in dire straits, raised interest rates for smaller borrowers and dried out credit for fresh investment. This combination of broke private sector bigwigs and broke banks is most severely impacting in precisely those sectors where public or public-private investment can make the most difference to the real economy - power, roads and telecom, as well as steel where world prices have collapsed.
With agrarian distress having sharply reduced rural demand, manufacturing stagnant when not actually in decline (as it has been declining in several successive quarters), one looks haplessly at the export sector to see whether any hope lies there. The answer is India's exports during April-December 2015 were a deeply disturbing 18.8 per cent below the same period last year. Inevitably, and  notwithstanding the steep fall in crude oil prices, the rupee has depreciated by a massive 9 per cent despite RBI's efforts to boost the rupee by spending some $3.6 billion to arrest the decline.
From where will fresh investment come in these circumstances? How can we facilitate the transition of the Indian economy from being consumption-driven to investment-driven? Where, in other words, are our acche din - and when are they coming?(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            In either case, UPA did not have the vision nor strategy to launch programs like start up India, gold monetisation, smart cities, clean India etc but instead gave us useless and populist laws like retrospective taxation, farmer debt write offs and NAREGA which plunged the economy and stock markets into a downward spiral.  And let us not forget about the corruption and crony capitalism that thrived under the congress, reintroducing the stench of days of the license raj that Sonia and her pappu son are only too happy to preside over.

                            Mr. MSA reminds me of the Rakshasa King, Hiranyakashipa. Though he disliked and hated Lord Narayana until his last breath, he went straight to heaven instead of hell, for the simple reason that even when he was hating Lord Narayana, in a way he was chanting Lord's name inumerbale number of times.<br/><br/>
I wonder where would Mr.MSA be heading after living his full life hating Mr.Modi. After all, I believe he probably must have chanted Mr.Modi's name more number of times than anybody else on the planet.

All we see is mounting intolerance being fanned and encouraged by senior people in the Central Government? Modi has really not shown any vision, any leadership at all. Smart Cities and Clean India (now renamed Swachh Bharat) are all continuation of earlier initiatives. In secularism, pluralism, and genuine patriotism, Modi is a disgrace to the country.

                            Another piece of brilliant writing by the one and only Manishankara Iyer. People may note that he has not spared policies of the UPA governments as well as the "Manmohanomics" that India is blindly following since 1991. No doubt liberalization enabled a section of poor and lower middle class to acheive higher levels of earning as well upward mobility economically. It has also allowed skewed growth ;service sector occupying over 60% of the economy at the cost of both agriculture and manufacturing unlike in the years prior to growth. Of course, Rajiv Gandhi was the most modern and visionary among India's PM as he exhorted Indians to be prepared for radical changes that would overtake the mankind in the 21st century even as his government started  massive programmes of computerization and ushered in a revolution in communication network and its expansion. The opposition including the BJP, the RSS, the left went hammer and tongs at Rajiv Gandhi and organized strikes and Bandhs for his emphasis on computerization and development of communication citing it would take away jobs of Indians. It is time for people to reflect whether the then opposition played a constructive role or not.

Modi as PM has gotten into Mani's mind and the thought itself has been tormenting him ever since. Mani is just taking his sweet revenge on readers by torturing readers of NDTV by his atrocious blogs.

Statistics speak volumes about the truth. After Modi's take over, things have gone worse and is going to be worst in the coming days. The difference is, a learned P.M, thinks in long term benefits and have counter measure in tackling things from his own brain, which Modi is very much lacking. Because his knowledge in the subject of economy and finance is very limited.

                            Mani is absolutely right. MM SIngh  piloted and created and handed over to Modi a robust USD 2 trillion economy. Modi is the toast of the world, not because he  has delivered anything, but because India is today the 3rd largest economy in the world, ALL THANKS TO MM SINGH. Indeed Purane din are the acche din. With Rupee in ICU, exports in a COMA, IIP is missrable, daals at 200/-, we can only feel sorry for the billions of Indians, especially the rural poor, who modi has completely ignored, as if they dont exist.

                            Mr. Aiyar must be still ruing his ChaiWala comment.<br/><br/>
A chai wala is driving the economy with all humility despite global headwinds and bad monsoon. Not to forget the congress scams he inherited.<br/><br/>
Aiyar unable to digest the fact that economy is doing better with out the need for any scams.<br/><br/>
The IMF, World Bank, all the fund managers worth their salt are betting on India and here is a guy who cannot stop himself from writing such canards.<br/><br/>
And about the bank loans, Mr Aiyar they were all doled out during your regime under political pressure. Now don't try to tarnish Modi for your wrong doings. He has a capable and qualified RBI governor whom he trusts in and seeks advice from. Bottom line our banks are broke not because of Modi or BJP. It was 10 years of Congress rule that made them what they are today. The super growth figures that you are quoting were achieved during UPA regime was achieved by looting the banks.<br/><br/>
So if todays acche din were same as yesterdays purine din as you put it, it means economy is still growing at +7%.<br/><br/>
Under MODI rupee came down from 63 to 69...but in the 10 years of Congress rule it came down from 35 to 63. What can you say about it Mr Aiyar.

                            Totally bemused by the analysis of Indian and World economics by Mr. Mani Shankar.

In the article it is portrayed that India's robust growth is inversely proportional to China 's growth. This is utterly unbelievable, coming from such a senior politician. The present Modi government is having a positive approach and not giving too much optimism and neither setting unrealistic targets. Thus, this helps in case of a downturn market trend as people 's confidence stays with the market instead of withdrawing as a result growing at a smart rate eventually. My take is that the Modi regime is taking forward and improving the standards and legislations set by Dr Manmohan Singh government. Not to take away anything from Dr Singh's brave handling of 2008 economic meltdown. India did well. Criticism just for the sake of it does not help.

                            its amazing that mr iyer still bask on fake glory of congress.ofcourse modi govt is not perfect and hav made many mistake but atleast of selling of coal mines, increasing production of coal, simplification of govt procedure in many fields, power generation improvement,sharing of tax revenue bet state-centre,solving road construction hurdle in many cases and ease of business partly, this govt is miles ahead of congress/upa. today congress is very weak  without support of regional party and its nitish,lalu,mulayam,mayawati,dmk,aiadmk ,tmc or even cpm etc will be some of prime movers to congress .<br/><br/>
holding gst ,seeking votes of poor by ensuring minimm productive ejob facility, confrontation on smallest pretext with wish to weaken present govt are more of fantasies bec even if modi weakens congress on own is unlikely to be in EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF INDIA till they change mindset to focus on better .<br/><br/>
we read and react to irrelavent column like mr iyer but it hardly offer solace of solution to indian society .better he wakes up for better india and better future for grandchildren of mir iyer

                            All said and done things are projected as if everything is going wrong with the economy/country and the govt. but just to ask Mr. Mani how are you contributing to fix these things. The party you belong to does nothing to support the ruling govt. in passing bills and just keeps taking some or the other excuse to stall the activities in the parliament and not let the Govt. function. If you have some ideas to bring improvement why not share and think in a positive direction instead of just complaining ?? As a responsible citizen of India is it not your duty to provide some brilliant ideas to bring the economy in track ?? Or you just glorify yourself by saying that all of us were fools to select and bring a party to power which you and your party members will not allow to function because your party lost miserably. If there is a tiny bit of conscience left in you it may be better to use your intellectual brain and suggest some constructive thoughts of improvement for your own country instead of just complaining like an old hag on negative things..

                            In UPA, we had 10% whole sale inflation. Due to global commodity crisis, price of raw materials has come down. So, manufacturers can produce more for the same investment and if they sell at the old prices, their profit would be more. Only revenue growth will show less. On the other hand, if inflation and commodity prices are high, even high growth rates will not help get profits or real money on the table.

Rajiv Gandhi died a quarter century ago!  He only got where he did because morons such as Mani were unable to even consider replacing the dreadful parivar that had colonised India following the departure of the British.  Just one simple fact will give lie to the moron's mutterings: The debt acquired by major businesses did not happen during Modi's tenure.  Modi merely inherited this from Manmohan's time!

                            Mani boy, your Congress party mismanaged the country for past few decades.  It just isn't possible to turn around the economy in 2 years.  You well know that, right Mani boy?  Even Obama needed 2 terms.  You should learn to forgive.  We can imagine how you must have felt, and is still feeling now, about how your "chaiwala will never become PM" statement catapulted Modi to PMs chair.  We also know that you haven't forgiven yourself for that slip of tongue.  But my dear Mani boy, you should try to forgive yourself.  People make mistakes, you know.  As for Rahul beta, he will never give you a post even if Congress comes to power in 2019.  So, dearest Mani boy, please take it easy and spend the rest of your days enjoying old age, instead of worrying too much about Modi and this nation.  You did what you could for Congress, and the country too, so please try to let it go and be easy on yourself.

2) If the opposition opposes for the sake of opposing (this applies to BJP too when they were in opposition) can a government function.<br/><br/>
