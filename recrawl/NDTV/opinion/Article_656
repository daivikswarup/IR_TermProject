Headline::::Propriety Demands Sushma Swaraj Should Quit



DateTime::::2015-06-15T18:09:00+05:30




                                It was about a month ago that I heard the country's Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, boast that the Modi government's biggest achievement in its first year was a corruption-free administration and that there was no scam or scandal. Every leader in the BJP, big or small, parroted this line. They can't any longer. Sushma Swaraj, the Foreign Minister, has admitted that she helped ex-IPL commissioner, Lalit Modi, a fugitive in the eyes of the law. There is a blue corner notice against him, the Enforcement Directorate has been investigating him and not long ago his passport was revoked. There are serious charges of match fixing and embezzlement of 700 crores.
Sushma Swaraj is a heavyweight politician and is widely respected by every section of the society. Before Narendra Modi won the Gujarat elections in 2012 for the third time in a row, she was considered the next prime ministerial candidate of the BJP. She was considered a favourite of the RSS and of Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray for the top job. She was anointed Leader of Opposition in place of LK Advani but with the emergence of Narendra Modi, she was eclipsed and had to accept a subordinate position in the cabinet. But she remains a potential threat to Mr Modi. So the recent controversy is not as simple as it appears. There is undoubtedly a serious issue of propriety - a foreign minister of the country is helping a fugitive by picking up the phone - but there is a political angle too.
I am aghast to see the brazen defence of Sushma Swaraj by BJP president Amit Shah and the RSS. Both have linked her act to nationalism and patriotism, which is a sham. The BJP is in the habit of hiding behind nationalism after any wrongdoing. The fact is that the foreign minister has admitted that she helped a fugitive. Whether or not it was on humanitarian grounds does not matter, for two reasons. First, will she again pick up the phone if Dawood Ibrahim or Chhota Rajan or Abu Salem or any terrorist requests her for help in obtaining travel documents because someone in the family has cancer or any other illness? I am dead sure she won't. Second, there is a question of quid pro quo. Lalit Modi purportedly helped her nephew get admission in Sussex University. Her daughter had been a member of Lalit Modi's lawyers' team. Sushma Swaraj's husband has also helped him as a lawyer. It's no coincidence that Lalit Modi, after getting his travel documents, sent a thank you email to Swaraj Kaushal. Why was the note sent to the foreign minister's husband? Does it convey something?
Propriety demands that she should resign. On similar grounds, the BJP, led by Ms Swaraj in Parliament, asked for the resignation of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor in 2010. Mr Tharoor, then minister of state for foreign affairs and blue-eyed boy of the Congress leadership, was cornered by the same Lalit Modi in a tweet in which he hinted at Mr Tharoor's involvement in a case of sweat equity of 70 crore with one of the IPL franchisees. Mr Tharoor was not directly involved but the BJP forced him to resign. Till now, nothing has happened in that case.
Then there is the curious case of Ashwini Kumar, former law minister, (and very close to then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh) who had asked the CBI to come to his office with the progress report of the coal scam investigations. He was accused of pressuring the investigating agency to manipulate the report. Protests erupted in Parliament and Ashwini Kumar was left with no option but to quit the cabinet. Till now there is no case against him.
Then there is the case of Pawan Bansal, former cabinet minister of company affairs. His nephew was caught fixing transfers and postings using Pawan Bansal's name. Before the case was investigated he exited the ministry. Again, no case has been registered against him.
Every time these scandals surfaced during the UPA regime, the BJP did not let Parliament function for weeks. Hundreds of hours of parliamentary business were wasted. The BJP would relent only when the minister in question resigned owning moral responsibility.
If Sushma Swaraj has set such high standards of morality in public life, then it's now incumbent on her to live up to them. She can't hide behind the "humanitarian" facade. Even there her defence is weak. If Lalit Modi was asking for travel documents, then he should have applied through the proper channels of bureaucracy. There was no need for the foreign minister to pick up the phone and talk to the British High Commissioner. The UPA government had taken a diametrically opposite stand and conveyed to the UK that if he was granted the document then it would affect the relationship between the two countries. The Manmohan Singh government had taken a tougher stand on this issue than the Modi government.
Let us also not forget that Lalit Modi had a very close relationship with the BJP. During Vasundhara Raje's first tenure as Chief Minister of Rajasthan, he was considered to be the man running the state administration. It was at this time that he came into prominence and became the president of the Rajasthan Cricket Association before making a lateral entry into the BCCI and subsequently assuming charge as the board's Vice President and commissioner of the Indian Premier League.
But the bigger question today is not whether Sushma Swaraj should resign. The question that should be asked is if Prime Minister Modi will retain her in the cabinet. It was he who had said, "Neither do I indulge in corruption, nor do I let anyone do so." Will he be true to his promise? I don't think so. He is in the habit of throwing such jumla or rhetorics in public life without any follow-up action. Had he been true to his words, he would not have inducted in his government Sanjeev Baliyan, an accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots, and Nihal Chand, who has been accused by a woman in Jaipur of rape. Almost 30% of his cabinet has serious criminal cases pending. And PM Modi has no problem sharing the table with them.
The bitter truth of Indian politics is that the BJP and the Congress wear shades of the same value system. Once out of power, they talk big but in the government, they speak a different language. I won't be surprised if Sushma Swaraj continues to function as a minister despite the media and public outcry. But it will certainly diminish the aura around Modi and his leadership. Manmohan Singh was lucky not to suffer such taints in his first term.
And this is just the beginning - many more scandals are waiting in the wings.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mr. Ashutosh , AAP must focus on governance and results, <br/><br/>
People are waiting to get the results which were promised during elections by you  and your AAP Government during election time .<br/><br/>
We Recommend you -  to avoid making expert comments since AAP is deep into trouble. Set your own house in order before making comments on other persons / parties. The episode of Mr. Tomar itself is a big example, of how corrupt people were holding ministry of law in the AAP Government. Why don't you have a LOKPAL in the state till date??????  AAP is in majority then what is holding it up from enacting the LOKPAL IN NEW DELHI???

                            you are a joke ashutosh. all of you trying to make a scandal out of nothing. she is neither involved in a 70 crore scam, nor the coal allocation scam, nor any other scam, so don't invent something. most likely, lalit modi is also a victim of the powerful politics in this country, but that is anyway a different matter. clearly there is no quid pro quo just as their relationship is 22 years old for kaushal and 7 years for the daughter, but there is a sort of conflict of interest which is a judgement call more than anything else. Am okay if there are people who have different opinions of the judgement call, but anyone making statements like you are is just a liar making a mountain out of nothing. your writing is also a form of extreme dishonesty by the way, which is why no one believes the AAP and its words and its body language anymore ... AAP is just plain dishonest, and not taking money and bribes is not the only form of honesty. Sushma has been immediately honest in this whole episode and really has nothing to hide.

Their nationalism is the loyalty to capitalists, this was true for BJP this will remain true. I am not a fan of any party but certainly BJP is not a choice even distant.

                            Ashutosh should not try to punch above his weight. He is an insignificant player in a minor party. He can comment on this controversy as a citizen, which he has every right to. But as a representative of a party that somehow manages to fall flat on its face every other day, this is ridiculous. It is understandable if the Congress goes to town over it. They have been very short of issues since the NDA came to power, and are still smarting over being rudely kicked out of power. But the AAP which has still not been able to get a grip on the city state of Delhi, should first attend to their governance issues rather than comment on national issues. It looks like a rat laughing at an elephant that slipped on a banana peel. Foolish.

                            One has to agree with what Ashutosh has said. Even if a small leaf fell in parliament, the BJP stopped parliament for days demanding a statement from the PM and got many ministers to resign from UPA government and wasted a lot of the countries time. <br/>
Congress and other parties are now trying the same trick. Basically, whoever we vote for, the Cong or BJP, this is going to recur.<br/><br/>
India is missing leaders like Atal ji who believed that opposition must be respected and democracy is taking all views together. THe BJP in its current form has stopped this practice.<br/><br/>
Even Sushma ji was good leader in the LS and she used to support good causes on many occasions. SHe has fallen out of favour. Just see around. BJP is becoming Modi. Eg. Earlier all the elections BJP used to fight with a CM candidate anointed at state level. Now there was no leader in Maharashtra, no one in J&amp;K and a rank outsider in Delhi.<br/>
Clearly this was what the Congress of old did.<br/><br/>
AAP is still a group of individuals who are grappling with power.It is like a child getting to drive a Mercedes<br/><br/>
All of us must think before we get guided by some news channels and partisan anchors and vote.

                            Just imagine if case against Lalit Modi turns out to be diametrically opposite than what is in public domain.This is because, even aftr 5yrs, Cong could not extradite him from UK despite cooperation from UK because they couldn't prove Modi's guilt in INDIAN courts. In all probability his case was that of personal enimity between him someone higher up in UPA.<br/>
So, if getting him to travel to Portugal should not be that much of a problem, even if he is your friend. The only problem for me is the conflict of interest. Ms Swaraj's husband and daughter were his legal advisors. Hence, it would have been prudent for her to stay away.<br/>
There has been large economic offenders who happened to be Congress's friends. Even as on date Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are economic offenders. One of the courts in Delhi has accepted that prima facie it appears that they have embezzeled public money in the National Herald case. But, the case is still in nascent stage and can go either way. Does it mean, their travels should be restricted. Further, Soniaji &amp; Priyanka had been sympathetic towards convicted killers of Rajiv Gandhi on "humanitarian grounds". any take on that?

His wife did have breast cancer and underwent surgery at Portugal hospital on Aug 2014. The photos with other celebrities are all taken before the incident and also shows his wife in the pictures. Sushma just gave a letter that allowing him to travel to Portugal would not cause issues in India-UK relations, cos indian govt had revoked his passport at the time, duly given back as per high court order. Should high court resign too?

                            BJP has hired so many stooges to comment against AAP. These anti national supporters are blind and unpatriotic. AAP is an honest outfits, there are bound to be some rotten apples in any group else aap hasn't committed any scams or frauds

                            Will Mr.Ashutosh explain to the readers:<br/>
1. The matter relates to July,2014! Why the persons demanding resignation of Sushmaji had not taken up the matter for the last elevan(11) months?Is it not a case of "baasi kadi may ubaal aaya"?<br/>
2.BJP Govt.replaced UPA Govt.on 26th May,2014.So its advisories to UK govt. gets lapsed,unless the present Govt, ratifies it!New Govt. could have its own scale of preferences!<br/>
3.Democracy,no doubt,entitles its citizens with"The Fundamental Right to Freedom of Speech"only,but NOT licence to level accusations against ruling Govt.or ministers without proper corroborating material evidences!<br/>
4. Once the Supreme Court has restored his passport and removed curbs on his movements, he could NOT be designated as "Fugitive"!<br/>
5. Sushmaji has made it quite plain that on purely"humanitarian grounds and good faith, she has intervened so as UK Govt.let the husband of a cancer patient visit the hospital where his wife is undergoing treatment!If Lalit Modi has misled her,he should be accused&amp;proceeded against and not the"good samaritan"!<br/>
6.Lastly,It is regrettable that our politicians are yet to learn very grammar of <br/>
a "Valid accusation againstany citizen"!

                            Medias should STOP encouraging guys like Ash Tosh (or) so called leaders of Mango 9Aam) Man (Admi) Party, to comment on serious matters.These leaders!! were found very natural &amp; "apt",when started clean, how ever acting it may be. They should continue such acts and elevate themselves to activities requiring higher IQ over a period of time and get in to Governance of Union Territory of Delhi some times during 2040-- just 25 yrs later and i'm sure by then they would become matured &amp; experienced enough to govern and talk relevant. So, for now please DO NOT disturbleaders!! of Mango Man Party and in particular Ash Tosh/ Aziz kaitan/ Chedda.

Propriety demands that AAP internal committee ask Arvind Kejariwal step down for fair trial.

                            Propriety demands that this Ashutosh character learns English before spewing this kind of diatribe.  His syntax leaves much to be desired and his grammar is a disgrace for a journalist.  That said, apart from being a prominent face in a very minor party, Ashutosh has absolutely no experience in such matters.  Mrs Swaraj stated to the British High Commissioner that were the UK to issue a travel document after following their own rules, then elations between the UK and India would not be affected.  She did not restore his passport neither did she interfere in the law of the land taking its course.  Modi travelled to Portugal and then returned to the UK. What he got up to after that is not Mrs Swaraj's doing. As for comparing Lalit Modi to Dawood and ther shady characters, as far as I know, Modi never murdered anybody, Dawood did.  Ashutosh ought to ingrain into his own head that not all of us think he and his friends in the AAP are heroic patriots always protesting against perceived injustices.  Some of us think they are a hopeless bunch of idiots who have subverted the democratic process and are leading Delhi to disaster.

                            Dear Ashutosh,<br/><br/>
There is no corruption involved with Sushma. Sushma is a great politician with significant years of contribution to this country. She had chosen to stay away from Reddy brothers when the corruption cases were registered against them.<br/>
There is a humanitarian reason involved here and it should be respected. And regarding the admission of her niece she has not sought any favour. The other side had offered favour but there is no email or anything proving that she accepted favour.<br/><br/>
Please focus on fixing Delhi issues and I hope AAP will be able to fix their house in order and spent the time and energy in focusing on that. Delhi people have lot of hopes from you and your party. Please spent more time as politician in your new avatar and not as journalist because that is what Delhi people want from you.<br/><br/>
Thanks<br/>

                            I am ashamed of these political fools asking Sushma to resign. They all have forgotten the work she's been doing for people suffering abroad (whether its Iraq, Libya or Yemen) or in international relations (which is her role) and bring out this silly slip up which even if true is hardly anything when you consider the good things she has done. I have no respect for the author and the quarters blowing up this issue. I am not a BJP supporter.
