Headline::::Charged Debate Over Yakub Memon Overlooked This



DateTime::::2015-07-31T14:15:00+05:30




                                Yakub Memon is dead and buried. The debate over the circumstances of his arrest and quantum of guilt in the Mumbai bombings of 1993 is infructuous now, at least for him and his family. Indeed, after the Supreme Court decided on the finality of his conviction, and heard out repeated mercy petitions, arguments on this ground are pointless. There has to be a closure to the legal case against Memon. 
Even so, the larger debate on the death penalty - energised in the days leading up to Memon's hanging - is an important one and should be continued and delinked from just Memon's story. Indeed, a sober and calmer discussion on the death penalty, without the context and emotions of an imminent execution, would be entirely recommended. This would be small comfort for those who wanted Memon to live, but could form an important guide for the future.
The case for abolishing the death penalty is a compelling one. Many genuinely believe that hanging a person amounts to an atavistic bloodlust and an outmoded notion of collective vengeance, that it is not part of the concourse of human civilisation. That apart, the death penalty, though rarely implemented in India, has a chequered and wholly inconsistent history. 
For example, there is no deadline for the President to decide upon a mercy petition. As of now, a convict sends his mercy petition to the President's office. The President forwards it to the Union Home Ministry. The Home Ministry forwards it to the state government in the jurisdiction of which the crime took place. Not only do state governments take their own time, they also decide on the basis of subjective assessments that may not meet the same a standard/a common benchmark. 
Next, how does one compare wrongdoing? Why should an Ajmal Kasab hang if those who killed Rajiv Gandhi don't need to? How is Yakub Memon designated more evil and less capable of redemption than Surendra Koli, the child killer of Nithari? These are troubling questions and are bound to be raised each time there is an execution.
Everybody recognises such inconsistencies and that is why, despite hundreds being on death row, only four people have actually been hanged in India in the past 20 years. Like so much else in this country, the handing out of a death sentence by a court has come to mean very little. It would be entirely in order if the death sentence were to go, and be replaced by imprisonment for life, till the natural demise of the convict.
However, there is a caveat to be entered here. At the root of the criminal justice system is the principle of deterrence. A wrongdoer is punished so as to teach him that there is a price to pay for a crime and to prevent recurrence. Releasing a person after a seven or eight term year prison term is a bet that he has learnt his lesson and will not relapse into crime. Keeping a person in prison for life is an assumption that the person cannot be redeemed and must be locked up for the rest of his years to safeguard society.
So how does one consider the case of a death-row convict who may not repeat his crime - or be able to repeat his crime because he is in prison - but could still pose a danger to society as the target of a high-value hostage crisis? Of the four people hanged in India since the turn of the millennium, arguably at least Kasab falls into that category. If his death sentence had been commuted, it is a logical expectation that the Lashkar-e-Toiba would have sought to have him released by trying to hijack a plane and so on. It would have been a tempting mission for a terror group.
Does one then abolish the death sentence for "ordinary" crimes but retain it for terrorism-related crimes, where the continued existence of somebody otherwise guilty of a capital crime could pose a danger to society even if the person himself is incapable of committing another act of terrorism? 
This would lead to another conundrum. At this juncture, the threat perception from terrorism is highest from groups that happen to be Islamist. In the 1980s, it was highest from groups that happened to be Khalistani. Does this mean, in a medium-term framework at least, there will end up being a de facto acceptance of a religious skew to those who are hanged? What of political implications to this, and how will the polity respond? 
By extending that argument to its logical absurdity, is the retention of a death sentence for terrorism-related crimes only acceptable if terrorism vanishes and nobody is hanged, or if there is a fair sprinkling of lethal, death-deserving terrorists from all significant religious communities to fulfil a politically acceptable quota system? The first proposition is utopian; the second is undesirable to the point of sounding macabre.
The points made above reflect the genuine confusion and dilemma of this writer, and, one suspects, of a larger group that is otherwise uncomfortable with the death penalty. They also offer a glimpse as to the practical problems politicians and governments will cite in retaining the status quo.Postscript: The death penalty correctly impels a moral and philosophical debate. It has to be pointed out though that fewer than 60 people have been hanged in India in the 68 years since Independence. 
In contrast, half a million children under the age of five die in India each year due to vaccine-preventable diseases. In a sense, they too are victims of the state and of a public immunisation programme that is failing to deliver. When was the last time you saw protests and a candlelight vigil for these children? When was the last time you heard a breathless television anchor bizarrely announce: "Rushing to Nagpur for the live telecast of a child about to die of whooping cough ... Many people present. They've been waiting for this moment for a long time ..."?

                            Very true and nicely said. I have been reading many opinions and articles on Yakub Memon episode, but this one really makes sense and relevancy...<br/>
 There are so many innocent lives are lost every year, due to various reasons... More importantly, in most cases,  not due to any of their wrongdoings....<br/><br/>
How many times, have the so called elite journalists, politicians and society leaders rallied behind to eradicate such causes? <br/><br/><br/>

                            So much of time &amp; energy for one life - that too not a good one! While millions are lost everyday for no fault of theirs! Severity of punishment goes with the status of development of society and the peculiar conditions prevailing at the relevant point in time. New York and Chicago were reformed only by severe punishments. We, in India, can think of softer punishments later at an appropriate time when we no longer face threats from external elements. Until then, we need to retain capital punishment. <br/><br/>
One other reason in support of capital punishment is that why should the taxpayer foot the expenses for retaining the life of a criminal providing them with food and security for their life time? These criminals don't deserve to live and this message must be made loud and clear. It is immaterial if such a punishment provides an effective deterrence against further crimes or not because if we go by the logic looking for lowering of crime rates due to method of punishments, it could lead to absurd conclusions to the extent that there is no need to jail the rapists as jailing them has actually not brought down the incidence of rape in the country!! It would be just nonsensical!

                            your dilemma and confusion of different yardsticks for such lethal crimes are genuine..Eye for an eye can make some change their path.When that is done by the order of the Courts after due process of law , it acts as deterrence.Should not trivialise the due process of law with isolated instances.May be in some instances like Gujarat, Sikhs in Delhi,Rajiv assassination guilty have not been punished but that does not mean we should plead for the release of culprits.Did they not kill innocent people and children without batting an eyelid.But when the courts give them death sentence after hearing their mercy pleas and curative petitions why should we question the Court judgments.People who respect democracy will know; people who want mobocracy will advocate abolishing death penalty.

                            Actually this question should be posed to the victims of terrorist,rape and other cruelties who actually know the pain and suffering which they undergo. Have any of the so called "elite" panel or the signatories of the "Dont hang Yakub Memon" campaign suffered any brutal happenings in their lives ? Will the Lalu and Mulayam yadavs pardon a  person who even dares to stare their women folk ? Will the same people say dont hang those who kill their near and dear ones ? They are safe, they are protected, they have power, they have money so they are well assured that nothing can happen to them. So they shout at highest decibels in AC studios and comforts. The truth is that in  our country laws are meant  only for common people. No judge, no politician,no leader ever come forward for the cause of common people. Have any of these so called "panelists" and "signatories"   bothered to enquire about the sufferings of the victims ? and or they have that much wisdom to overrule the decision taken by the highest judicial authority of the country ? Is Sania Mirza also has that much legal expertise to challenge the judgement of three judges of Supreme court ? or  she was sympathetic to Yakub  simply because he was a muslim ?

                            If death penalty is substituted by "jailed till natural death", the society is actually rewarding a crime by provision of free food, shelter, medicine, safety and security. This is especially bad when millions of non-criminals go without those! That will inspire those millions to actually do wrong and avail all goodies in the jail!<br/>

                            Congratulations! Good article. In continuation of thoughts, I feel that death sentence should remain in our Law may be limited to any activities against the state and country. One surely will then require to "Define" properly what constitute that crime irrespective of any religious status.<br/>
I can not accept that a person who has done a crime against the state or the nation should be spared and sent to a life term punishment. In such scenario, I am against any spending of the public tax money on such a criminals who have caused killings and injured our citizens or became a reason for such events. Why we as a citizen pay for keeping him "alive" ? Just doesn't make any sense. Humanity is not one way affairs but it should always be two ways! Activist and the governments are seen moving only one way and ignoring the victims and their families. In this case as well, I have not seen anyone who took a vociferous stand in favor of the victims. One section was supporting the criminal while others were indulged in the politics! Now you expect, families who have suffered, should pay for the criminal's up-keeping for the life? What's wrong with you guys? May be you can move against the death sentence for other crimes not threatening the National security and its tax paying citizens.

I just do not understand why a big section of the society wants the judiciary to miss out the chance of making every terrorist fear attacking the country by pronouncing softer punishments. It looks as if all are up for a great soul, while the reality is inverse.

                            Why does the author have a dilemma? India is in a state of war with Pakistan. The latter uses disgruntled Islamic elements in India to commit mass murder as a tactic to further its Kashmir objective. The Memons, Kasab and their ilk are like enemy soldiers conducting operations in India. Ideally they should be KIA but they escaped or got captured alive. Now in a war enemy soldiers need to be eliminated immediately. So these enemy combatants deserve death. You cannot compare psychopath criminals like Surindet Koli with Pakistan sponsored soldiers. There you can have a separate debate for the need or elimination of death penalty.

                            Yakub memon, I don't know. But capital punishment is a must in this country of illiterates. Until they gear law they will keep providing assistance to terrorists  or for that matter high profile rape and murder cases just keep going on in the courts. Not only a capital punishment but tv broadcast should take place in few cases where the message needs to be loud and clear. If 1 culprit is seen hanging in a case like nirbhaya, 10 others will get the message loud and clear.

                            I don't really agree with the part where the author mentions there would be  "religious skew" in the judicial system on who should be hanged or labelled terrorists. I think its an attempt to taint the system on communal lines. A terrorist is defined by the act of terror he commits - not by his religion.

                            Reasonable article. I would never agree with the reasoning for abolishing the death penalty on the grounds like it is medieval and does not fit to our present civilization standards. If that is so, then many other sectors, such as, defence and police shouldn't be using lethal assault weapons which kills life, and it is also medieval.

                            Forget deterrence, what about alleviation of the severe pain of the kin of the hapless victims who unexpectedly lost their lives in this mindless and gratuitous act of terrorism? How would THEY feel if a monster like Yakub were allowed to live on taxpayer's money for the rest of his life?<br/><br/>
Yes, more consistency is perfectly desirable. However, no two crimes are exactly the same. And there is a very good reason why the President of the Nation alone gets to rule on a mercy plea (in consultation with the elected government). When it's terrorism and a crime against state, or something that jeopardizes the national security, it's appropriate to deliver a judgement that's in line with the sentiment of the majority of Indians and the decision of the judiciary as well.<br/><br/>
Because it must be in line with the desire of people. You and I cannot foist and impose OUR OWN perception of progress onto the people no matter how firmly we believe in them.

                            It is ridiculous to even think of abolishing death penalty. Certain crimes including terror related must be given the extreme punishment to act as deterrence. How else heinous crimes can be deterred? Murder for murder is not an ideal solution. But mere life sentence for ghastly murder is not fair either. Instead of debating death penalty, the debate should be about how to expedite the process of delivering justice. It is a crime to let the criminals languish in jails. Their fate must be expeditiously decided one way or the other. Death penalty must be used only in the rarest of rare cases and there should be no partiality whatsoever. India is a democratic and civilised country but when uncivilised and barbaric crimes are committed, the law cannot show any leniency. It will be a travesty of justice to the victims and their relatives. People like Shashi Tharoor, instead of trying to invoke emotional phrases like 'murder for murder' should come up with concrete solutions that would be a real deterrent.
