Headline::::BJP's Moves to Destroy Kashmiriyat



DateTime::::2015-04-13T15:36:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha)
The worst of a coalition of opposites, such as we have in Jammu & Kashmir, is that to keep the alliance going, the partners indulge in what can only be described as "competitive communalism".
Nothing else explains how an otherwise decent Chief Minister could have made the appalling suggestion that he would construct a series of habitations in the Valley into which he would funnel returning Kashmiri Pandits, thereby reducing the proposed exclusively Pandit communities to a string of Bantustans, as the apartheid regime in South Africa had done to definitively separate White from Black. Fortunately, Mufti Sahib has now fudged his original intention by claiming he was misunderstood. But the proposal has not been withdrawn, merely kept for the moment in abeyance.
It is the BJP partner in the coalition who is pressing for the early return of the Pandits to the Valley. Mufti Sahib's PDP is more than willing to welcome back the Pandits. Indeed, all elements of the Kashmiri polity, including the Hurriyat, assert the necessity of the Pandits returning to Valley. They do not, emphatically do not, regard the Pandits as aliens. But the Pandit community as a whole continues to be apprehensive about their security in the company of their fellow Kashmiri Muslims, and the BJP-Sangh Parivar does everything it can to aggravate these fears, however unfounded.
Hence, on the one hand, the movement for a Panun Kashmir, carved out of a portion of the Valley, where the Hindus would live isolated from, and apart from, the Valley Muslims, and not in composite neighbourhoods. It is a repudiation of the essence of Kashmiriyat, an institutionalization of the wholly bogus line that Hindus and Muslims cannot live together in the Valley, that they must remain separated. This is the line favoured by the bulk of the Jammu BJP. Stopping short of the Panun Kashmir line, but not going so far as to draw the Hindu-Muslim divide along the Chenab river that divides Kashmir from Jammu (as the Pakistanis have sometimes suggested), the PDP has sought to bridge the two positions by placing on the table for discussion the establishment of a series of Hindu Bantustans in the Valley. In practical terms, there is little to choose between the Panun Kashmir proposal and the Mufti proposal. Both would spell the end of the spirit of Kashmiriyat and institutionalize a gulf between Pandit and Muslim that was never part of the traditional unique ethos of the State, where the two communities have lived in peaceful harmony for centuries.
The original sin was that of Jagmohan, who in his second term as Governor of J&K, that happily lasted under six months (January-May 1990), either panicked or revealed the deepest of his prejudices in facilitating the emptying of the Valley of almost all its Pandits in a matter of days in March 1990. The Pandit population in 1990 was about 1,70,00. It has now been reduced to some 7,000 - but all 7000 have lived through the last terrible 25 years in the same mohallas as the Muslims, a shining beacon of secular togetherness in this most trying of times. So integral to Kashmiriyat is the imperative of the two communities living together that the separatists led by Syed Geelani have been among the loudest in affirming the importance of the Pandit community returning to the Valley and condemning the idea of Pandits-only Bantustans.
 
Why did Jagmohan panic? He has provided the answers himself in his book, My Frozen Turbulence in Kashmir, a detailed apologia for his actions during the disaster that overtook the Valley in his brief term. He arrived just as extremist elements began filling the governance void in Srinagar consequent on the elected Farooq Abdullah government resigning office and Governor Krishna Rao doing the same in the wake of the VP Singh government refusing to heed their cautionary advice against the State government releasing dreaded convicted terrorists in exchange for the release of the kidnapped daughter of the then Union Home Minister, the same Mufti who is now Chief Minister of the State.
True, night after night, the most vicious anti-Pandit propaganda was broadcast from microphones installed in mosques. True, gruesome killings accompanied the propaganda. True, eminent, secular Kashmiris, the very embodiment of Kashmiriyat, were targeted. It looked as if the only way the Pandits could save themselves would be to flee the Valley. But why? It was the duty of the administration led by the Governor to not succumb to these threats, to take appropriate action to protect the unprotected, and to take the sternest action against those who were disrupting the peace of the Valley. Instead, the Governor took fright.
On page 478 of his book, Jagmohan quotes his Additional Director-General of police. He says that in the period between December 1989 and May 1990 (Governor Jagmohan's term), a total of 134 innocent persons were assassinated. Of these, says the Additional DG, as many as 71 were Hindus. Elementary mathematics would show, although the additional DG is not quoted as saying so, that this must mean 63 were Muslims. In other words, the number of Muslims killed was just eight less than the number of Hindus killed. This was not a communal massacre. It was a massacre of loyal Indians by thugs and terrorists. The rhetoric was communal, but the victims were almost equally Hindus and Muslims.
Much closer to the truth than the Governor was HN Jattu, President of the All-India Kashmiri Pandit Conference who was quoted in The Hindustan Times of 8 February 1990 - that is, in the middle of the worst atrocities - as saying that all communities suffered, the Pandits much as the Muslims. He also said - and this is the moot point - that the Kashmiri people were suffering not because of any Hindu-Muslim incompatibility but because of "misrule and maladministration".
Whose misrule? Whose maladministration? Governor Jagmohan's, of course. He had taken undue and unwarranted advantage of the J&K Constitution to dissolve the duly elected assembly and assume dictatorial powers of governing the State. Indeed, it was the extent and depth of his misrule that led to VP Singh recalling him within six months. There could be no more damning indictment of the suffering he caused the people of Jammu & Kashmir, specifically the Pandits whom he had deprived of home and hearth instead of throwing a protective arm around the collective shoulders of all Kashmiris, Hindu or Muslim. For a quarter of a century, we have continued to rue that misrule.
Yet, it is Jagmohan's fans and acolytes who swell the ranks of the BJP in Jammu. It is they who are advocating a Jagmohan-like solution that is worse than the problem. It is they who want the Pandits back in the Valley - but in Hindu ghettos that emphasize the Hindu-Muslim divide. That is why they must be resisted. Mufti Sahib must not let himself be deflected from his larger purpose by these half-baked proposals for the return of the Kashmiri Pandit to his homeland.
The doors and windows of all Kashmiris must be opened to all Kashmiris without regard to religion.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

The so called kashmiriyat was dead and burried in the 1990s itself. And to call Jagmohan resposnible for migration is just supporting the Pakistani and the Separatists view. Which side of the Border are you?. We pandits will always be indebted to Jagmohan for saving us. Have some common sense mate...!!

                            Mani shankar, don't try to portray that Jagmohan was a BJP loyalist alone.  Of couse he joined BJP but only in late '90s.  Before that, true to the reputation of "Nehru-Gandhi loyalist", he did maximum damage to J&amp;K.  He was appointed as Governor for 2nd term by VP Singh Govt. and ably supported by Congress.  Congress has been decimated in J&amp;K and has no locus standi to suggest anything now.  Whatever you had to do, should have been done when you were in power with the Abdullahs.  As expected, you did nothing and people punished you.

                            Congressmen should be ashamed of on speaking about plights of Kashmiri Pandits. Kashimiri Pundits were thrown out of valley on the basis of their religion. Congress conveniently kept quite for last 25 years on issue as it would have dented its 'SECULAR' ( SICKULAR) image. And now NDA wants to do something for them , this Mani is finding fault in it. Yes Pandits wants special and separate township as Sickulars in Valley had lost right to stay with them

                            Kashjmiriyat is older than the likes of YAsins and Geelanis.... KAshmiriyat existed way into the period of MArtand temple nad saraswati worship of yore... So dont cloud it with a latest addition to the geo that came in last 1000 years.... Driving away Pandits was to ethnically cleanse the land of the original Kashmiriyat and replace it with manufactured Kashmiriyat of the Terror loving folks.... I sincerely think religion has nothing to do with this.. <br/><br/>
True muslims will never harm their neighbors and these folks who cry in the name of Islam and Kashmiriyat are definitely political puppets in somone's hands and their tune is being sung by other puppets in political parties and media..

                            I am tired of Mr Mani's blogs here. The articles are always so filled with hate against BJP that now it has become a same content repeated again and again with only headlines changing. Grow up Mani ! You have reached a point that now every article of yours is anti national. Your govt could do nothing for Kashmiri Pandits and wonder what kind of shamelessness does it take to point fingers at those who are trying to give respite to the Pandits. Secondly given the way Kashmir is would the Pandits live in peace and security across Kashmir? Everyday there is a militant strike and if Pandits are scattered across then to kill these pandits would be much easier for the militants. Its sensible for the time being to give a separate settlement .Given what happened to them 25 years back only anti Indians will rant Mani's quotes.

                            So, according to Mani Shankar Aiyer, Kashmiri Pandits returning to Kashmir is destruction of Kashmiriyat or Kashmiri Pandits wanting to live in separate colonies is destruction of Kashmiriyat? One thing is for sure, they will be extremely awkward when they return back to the valley. So, they'll all (pandits and muslims) will need to be given more time to become normal and slowly embrace each other so as to create the peaceful environment in the valley. But these congress leaders won't let that happen else, that'll be the biggest failure of their agenda of divide and rule strategy.<br/>
Congress needs to be demolished completely in order to save our country.

                            If the problem is absolutely nothing to do with Religion, then why only the HINDU numbered more than 3 lakhs had to flee the valley in the first place? Again if all the people including Hurriyat want the Pandits to come back, then what is stopping these SECULAR Kashmiris from Handing over the Pandits' homes &amp; properties back to the original owners? Pandits were born as Hindus &amp; hence they have no sympathy from SECULAR LIBERAL INTELLECTUAL community of India. This is Trademark Indian Secularism.

                            As a kashmiri I think pandits have a right to come back. But remember there will be no smart cities for you. Just accept that. 1 lac kashmiris are dead. India should be tried in international criminal court first.

                            What is this 'Kashmiriyat'? Does only Kashmir have something that marks it out from the rest of India which believes in 'Insaniyat'? The root cause of all problems in Kashmir is the special status given to it which needs to be corrected. The problems created by Nehru have visited misery on both Kashmir and India. Just like Indira mishandled the Sikhs and Rajiv bungled in Sri Lanka. Congress leaders have a long history of bungling sensitive issues. To blame Jagmohan for Kashmir's problems is senseless. During President's rule it is the Union Home Ministry that rules the state through the Governor. To blame him for the exodus of Pandits is puerile. The militants were not handled with an iron fist which would have made them see sense long back. Just like KPS Gill handled the Sikh militants. Militants understand only the language of violence, so they should be subjected to an excess of it like in the Punjab. Pampering them only worsens the problem. As for Aiyer's analysis, as usual it makes no sense. Poor guy, he insists on tackling topics well beyond his level. Feel sorry for him.

                            Mani like Digvijay Singh is a BJP mole in Congress. He knows more he browbeats the trumpet and explains "Congress view point" more he helps in Congress mukt Bharat. Well done Mani!<br/>
Here are the proofs that Mani is BJP mole<br/>
1. Called Modi a chaiwala and let voters consolidate in favor of him<br/>
2. Speaks very low of Congress view point - to alienate educated middle class.<br/>
3. Doesn't speak against any of the other parties including the left SP, BSP, TDP, AIMIM so that Muslims remain confused and dont consolidate their vote against BJP.<br/>
4. Uses bad language that he learnt as special secretary to Sonia's OSD Aamad Patel's son.

                            According to MSA the blame for everything that is ill in the country can be laid at the doors of every Indian who is not a congressi. And yet the country has been ruled by the congress for 60 years since independence. Does that mean that successive congress govts were incapable, inept and totally useless? This  includes all their PMs namely Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Narasimha Rao &amp; Manmohan Singh. Did not include Lal Bahadur Shastri because he was the PM for just about 2 years. ON THE OTHER HAND PROBABLY WHAT MSA MEANS IS THAT THE INDIAN VOTERS ARE TO BLAMED FOR ALL THAT IS ILL IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY ELECTED THE CONGRESS TO RULE FOR 60 YEARS.

                            There is a Hindi saying that is apt for Mani Shankar - ulta chor kotwal ko daante! Mr. Aiyar, let us count the ways in which your party has mismanaged Kashmir and lost opportunities. 1) Taking Kashmir to the UN. 2) In 1972, losing an opportunity to settle Kashmir when 93,000 POWs were in Indian jails and you had the Pakistan Army by the collar. 3) In 1989, when you cheated in elections and began the Kashmir unrest, and 4) giving in to terrorists who kidnapped a minister's daughter. 5) In 1990, not protecting the Hindus when communalism was at its worst.<br/><br/>
Kashmiriyat died when Muslim Kashmiris refused to stand up for Hindu Kashmiris post 1990. Even after 1990, there was no effort by those who claim to be endowed with Kashmiriyat to bring the Pandits back on their own. They could have done it if they wanted to, by standing up to the terrorists and taking the help of the Indian Army, and by exposing their comrades who were helping the terrorists. They didn't and took the easy way of out of doing nothing.

                            Kashmiryat was destroyed by Congress with the strange thing called Article 370. If that article is not practice of apartheid what is?

There is a popular saying that at last people become wise with age. You seem to defy even that.Has congrees left any Kashmiriyat intact, for any one-leave aside BJP- to destroy. Now one can only retrieve it or restore it. So relax and enjoy the retirement and the snub you regularly get from  Congress.

                            MSA may be or may not be true. However, the truth is learned and experienced people get polarised in the society so much so that it leads to multiplication of opinions and views leading to confusion and lack of progressive direction for a healthy society and its unity.

                            Kashmiri culture is a single entity.it has never been divided on community basis.What is significant is that both the communities are against this divide.An exclusive settlement for people retuning home will create a sort of separate <br/>
homeland, which will not be acceptable to any quarter.Attempts of the newly formed PDP-BJP coalition,BJP in <br/>
Particular,should be to bridge this gulf and not to widen it further.

                            It is Kashmir card or not but it is necessary to scrap this article 370? Please try to understand "Self-preservation is the default mode of the self-destruction". and that has happened with Kashmir. The problem in Kashmir is not financial or religious. It is a political problem. Once politics is out of that game, it can be solved in no time. Article was introduced to preserve the Kashmiry peaceful culture and where it is now? If such law was not there or had been scraped long back from the so called pious constitution, Kashmir had now well developed and industrial state in which instead of terrorism, tourism and industries would have been flourished and unemployment would have been of the past. In absence of private investment, the situation has created heavy unemployment which has created Satanic brain in the youth and that has ruined original Kashmiri peaceful culture. With such law in existence, where, outsiders can not buy the property in that part of the Nation, how one can expect private investment, which is required for industry for development of the state, from foreign and other Indian states? When will our so called mean nature leaders and Indian pseudo secular media will come up from their mean politics and put forward this basic rule of economics with the new Kashmiri generation. It requires open market, just as it is in other parts of the Country. Instead of appeasing the minority, the real solution is in repelling that Article 370 from the Constitution as soon as possible.

                            It is better to be in a ghetto than be dead. Having been at the receiving end of being "ethnically cleansed", the Kashmiri pundits will be apprehensive to say the least. Who would want to put their lives and the lives of their loved ones at risk. It has taken decades just to get a debate going. The Kashmiri pandits are well withing their rights to ask for safety first. Congress , in powerf or the last decade did not even get any kind of dialogue started about the reurn to the killing fields of Kashmir, at least BJP has. But of course, in its usual bluster all Congress folks are so quick to offer advise. But advise is not something that the Kashmiri pandits want, particularly from Congress, a Congress that abandoned them in ghetto camps.
