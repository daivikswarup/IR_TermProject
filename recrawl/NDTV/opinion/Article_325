Headline::::Betrayal of Kashmiriyat Restrains BJP's Mission 44



DateTime::::2014-12-24T15:59:00+05:30



(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer. She is working on a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi which will be published in 2015.)In the run-up to the Kashmir elections, a senior leader from the BJP parliamentary board spoke to me about the need to weed out the Mufti Sayeed-led PDP from Kashmir: "We believe that in order for complete control on India, Kashmir is essential, and we mean Kashmir without the separatists and separatist sympathizers."The reference was to the PDP, which has been accused of going soft on the demand for an Azad Kashmir, a party which accused the Abdullahs of shelving the plebiscite movement in 1975 and sacrificing the interests of Kashmiris.It was Mehbooba Mufti who backed AAP leader Prashant Bhushan's call for a referendum on the Armed Forces Special Powers Act or AFSPA. It was the Mufti-led PDP which accused the Congress of playing soft Hindutva by hanging Afzal Guru in February, 2013.In a classic turnaround after the results, similar to the one seen with rival NCP in Maharashtra, BJP President Amit Shah said he was not averse to the idea of forging an alliance with the PDP.Despite the last-ditch measures and politicking that is playing out, the BJP's dream of absolute control of India's only Muslim-majority state looks possible.That the BJP has been restricted to 25 seats as against its declared Mission 44 is a result of the fascination of the Sangh Parivar to see a Hindu Chief Minister. It is this dream that had a BJP leader concede in an informal conversation on counting day that a compromise formula of a rotational Chief Minister could see the party support Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.RSS leaders campaigning in Jammu and Kashmir gave 'Kashmir hamara hai' a communal overtone as opposed to what could have been a nationalist slogan. It was this idea of propriety that saw the RSS cadres galvanise the Hindu voter in Jammu, and reduce the Kashmir election to a Hindu-versus-Muslim battle. The displaced Kashmiri Pandit who continues to strive for his dignity, for his dream to return back to his homeland, was reduced to just another 'Hindu' voter.Senior Intelligence Bureau officials affiliated to the Sangh in the past had suggested to Amit Shah that Omar Abdullah was a natural ally in comparison to the PDP - this when rumours strongly suggested that a senior RSS functionary had met Mufti Sayeed as early as December 2013.BJP President Amit Shah is not treating the National Conference as a pariah, knowing the Abdullahs' famed love for power. Farooq Abdullah had famously supported the NDA government before returning to power in Kashmir and expressing regret for his decision. But the BJP is back in power in Delhi and it may not be very difficult to woo back the Abdullahs.As I write this, BJP leaders are alleged to have opened channels of communication with Omar Abdullah's National Conference with Sajjad Lone playing the role of mediator, and seeking the support of other independents.As for the PDP, BJP spokespersons reminded the media of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's congenial relations with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed when he was Chief Minister. Saeed's PDP has emerged the single largest party, falling 14 short of the magic figure.After a meeting with Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad in Delhi a few months ago, the PDP's Mehbooba Mufti accused the BJP of polarising Jammu and Kashmir and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the RSS of exercising a communal propaganda before elections. But true to the nature of Indian polity, Muzaffar Baig, PDP heavyweight, insisted that the communal experiment had nothing to do with the BJP.The numbers show that the Modi wave alleged to be at work across the country refused to strike a reconciliatory note with the Valley. BJP leaders who spoke of Modi being Vajpayee's avatar refused to tell the nation that Vajpayee was one of the first national leaders to accept that there 'was' a problem with Kashmir that could not be overlooked. Vajpayee was one of the few leaders to understand that if the Kashmir issue was to be addressed, the separatists had to be brought to the table, that the common man of Kashmir needed to have faith in the Indian state.The BJP's idea of Kashmiriyat, as we have seen today, stands in complete contrast to the vision of Vajpayee. It was this betrayal of Kashmiriyat which restrained BJP's dream of Mission 44.Irrespective of the outcome, this election has huge learnings not just for the Congress, which appears to be inching towards complete decimation, but for the BJP, who should see that its development card isn't being bought everywhere and its complete reliance on the Modi wave and Amit Shah juggernaut is proving to be detrimental to its newly-achieved success in Delhi. One of the most significant learnings for the party is that it cannot continue to shift from Dr Jekyll to Mr Hyde as per convenience.While Prime Minister Modi spoke of Kashmiriyat in the Valley, his colleagues from the RSS invoked the Pandit pride, aligning it with the idea of Hindutva. RSS workers worked overtime in Jammu using religion as a calling card, talking of restoring the pride of former army men. All this while the party's Muslim face, Hina Bhatt, delivered comments ranging from taking to a gun over Article 370 to bringing in a culture of change.Despite the possibility that the BJP could well be a part of the new government, whether it's with the PDP or the NC, the fact that the party was restrained at 25 proves that it's time the BJP understands that religious polarisation might not be its best bet. The common man in the valley has come out to vote in huge numbers to reassert its faith in the Indian democracy, but the PM and his partymen refused to understand that Kashmir is not Uttar Pradesh.Kashmiriyat is not about placing the state as the crowning glory of Akhand Bharat or a Hindu Rashtra, Kashmiriyat means treating every son of Jammu and Kashmir as a rightful heir to the idea of India.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            The author needs to seriously introspect within her before coming up with such stuff. Everyone knows that the NC and PDP have played to the separatists when it suited them. The author should not let her religion influence her perspectives or else at least not call herself an investigative journalist

Funny part is all of them have pathological hatred for BJP and Modi, but still come up with advice to BJP &amp; Modi. I just loving their frustration. There are two ways you can deal with pigs &amp; barking dogs &gt;&gt; #1 ignore them (BJP has chosen this) &amp; #2 give them filth and throw them bones(which was the path chosen by congress).

                            If PDP wins only in Kashmir Valley, only in Muslim majority seats and only Muslim MLAs. But it is secular.<br/><br/>
If BJP wins only in Jammu, only in Hindu majority seats (fact is that it won few Muslim majority seats in Cheenab Valley) and has Muslim MLA too. But is is non secular and communal. <br/><br/>
This is the logic of most analyst and journalist.<br/><br/>
And by joining PDP, if BJP put a side 370 &amp; AFSPA, same way PDP is going to pus Selfrule demand in side. Thus it would be win win for both.<br/><br/>
And no party can win election in first attempt. Forget candidates, BJP even didn't has any office in Valley. This time they filed candidates and candidate also got few thousands votes. This was the great effort by any political party<br/><br/>
All party is fighting election to form government and now BJP is going to form government. So 50% of its mission they achieved. ....it should be appreciated and very good for National Interest of India

                            This writer should note that so called "Kasmiriyat" etc need to be shown the doors. These kind of false prides is what is holding us behind. This is the iconic leg pulling of one lobster by another lobster resulting in not a single lobster getting away. Why only "Kashmiriyat" Why not "Ladakhiyat",Jammuiyat", "Vaidarbhiyat" , "Jatiyat", "Kshatriyat" etc<br/>
We have to be very careful of "Devide and rule" , I do not know what has been achieved by division of Andhra in "Telengana" and "Seemandhra". We are having double the administrative expenses which are almost 50 % of our revenue. These special statuses needs to be thrown off asap. As Nehru was Kashmiri, he wanted special status for Kashmir, that is why this concept of Kashmiriyat and resulting destruction came. See  we have no issue in Hyderabad today. Though Owasis is trying to raise it by praising Nizam. Had Nehru allowed Patel to have his way, Kashmir would have been long amalgamated and there would not have been any problem. While dealing with such issues, interest of nation has to be supreme above all human rights etc. If not then destruction follows. Muslim invaders kept cows in front of them while attacking Rajputs. As Rajputs surrendered to save those cows because of lofty principles they followed, Muslims won and killed many more cows thereafter. Had Rajputs put National interest before any other so called lofty principles, things probably would have been different. Nation should come first.

                            Every one have his/her own views, for example.. a lion killing goat, someone feel poor goat and someone feel lion is hungry it has to kill, so if you hare a person or party for various reasons no matter wht they do u c in negative mind, the BJP in valley get 25 seats which they never had anything previously, don't forget the 25 figure includes both Muslim &amp; Hindu, why anyone can say im Hindu, whats wrong with that, even our H'ble supreme court said Hindu is not religion its way of living. Is BJP only party polarizing votes, even in Vajpayee rule also RSS exists,so you want to hate BJP coz of Modi who always want to say Im Hindu... does he ever said anything about anti National....Let him give some chance to prove himself.. we wasted so many years with congi rule,, which is now wiped out of India(soon in rest of the states).. Those havent done for years asking him to deliver in 6 months...Every one knw its the numbers in Rajyasabha which any bill to pass.. what happened in the last winter session u can c... they just stopped everything make sure the Govt wont function and at the same time they r saying they haven't deliver..Modi is not perfect but he is very good administrator. Funny thing is Congi saying no modi wave ... do they checking their numbers.. ..The great Lalu ji talking abt Black money who is criminal and supreme court sentensed him to jail and now on bail with health reasons is giving bhashan... God save us India.... Modi Never said Black Money in Hundred days nor he give 15lac black money to each one.. he said if Black money can bring back every person can have that much amt...He ll wait another 2 years coz after tht RS seats for BJP will go up and then he is unstoppable...as i mentioned earlier we wasted 60+ years in Congi rule.. cant we wait for 5 Years...People who r saying Feku.. where were they when congi rules... r they sleeping..for past 60 years..Namo

                            It seems secularism should be there only when the Hindu population is in majority,why is the author worried about an Hindu CM for J&amp;K,if we can have Sikh PM and Muslim president for Hindu majority India.<br/><br/>
The best secular idea should be to have an Hindu (preferably a kashmiri Pandit) as CM as this will bring kashmiri Pandits to the mainstream in their own land

Any party looking for a single party rule  has to focus on securing the halfway mark. If one falls short does not mean you undermine their performance . She does say anything on the fact that BJP has got the highest Vote percentage are just 3 seats behind the strong local PDP .  If the People of Valley have not voted for BJP is mainly due to the constant negative propaganda and fear physcosis  created in the minds of the Muslim community. The day this myth is shattered  all these pseudo secularists  will have no face to hide. jealous morons.

                            Is there Kashmiriyat today ? Geelani repeatedly goes around and says Muslims cannot live with Hindus and uses that ideology to justify continued ethnic cleansing of Pandits Or deny leasing land for Amarnath Pilgrims, questioning their age old customs and restricting their religious freedom. PDP and NC played second fiddle to all those elements. <br/>
Today, the rehabilitation of Pandits remains a distant dream. For initial security they want to stay in enclaves, but that is also opposed. After a riot hit area it is but natural for citizens of one community to live together. If it is Ok for Juhapura in Ahmedabad, I am not sure why that is not ok in J&amp;K.<br/><br/>
I do not know how NDTV can allow folks like Rana Ayyub to write articles which is so devoid of reality and ignores the reality of Political Islam in Kashmir Valley. Ladakh and Jammu have suffered enough under the tyranny of Political Islam. For the author's kind information Political Islam is incompatible to the constitution of India. Unless Valley based Muslims come around to the view that Political Islam is bad for them, nothing can really change. The younger educated generation are realizing this, but the process is still slow, since Pakistan keeps injecting extremist elements to vitiate the atmosphere. What is needed is a coalition of young generation Muslims from valley who abhor Political Islam and folks from other areas to revive true Kashmiriyat and work closely with the security apparatus to isolate and destroy sleeper cells of Non-secular Pakistanis and their sympathizers embedded in J&amp;K. The state will then see its real-potential until then. <br/><br/>
Once that happens, it can then assert its rights on water issues and provide an environment conducive for a big jump in tourism, and leave PoK way behind. Pakistan screwed PoK with demographic invasions reducing Kashmiris to a minority there, and they are trying to prevent any development in J&amp;k region of India, while letting Chinese soldiers into parts of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. It is time J&amp;K citizens use the autonomy whatever is provided to develop their state and use the BSF to keep Barbarians from Pakistan at the border and purge the state of Political Islamists.

                            Results from valley can be interpreted as communal bias. Earlier valley boycotted elections. That was seen as rejection of India and its constitution. Now they chose to go by Indian constitution but elected only particular community. They may fear BJP but Congress is an option for them. Yet they chose only local parties which are known to cater only one community.

The NC/PDP effect for the last 5 decades has made K&amp;K as the extension of Pakistan. None of the political party has had inroads in J&amp;K as BJP has . I am sure this is the beginning and very soon , J&amp;K will be ruled by the real Indians.

If journalists such as you could not understand that, then shame on you. BJP achievement is no less than stunning. You are criticizing BJP for being open for alliance with PDP. But what about PDP being open to forming alliance with BJP? I am not sure what problem do you have with BJP foraying into JK? People like you have no objections muslims in JK voting only for muslim candidates throughout the history.

                            No doubt this reporter gets her journalistic ideology from the Blitz newsmagazine. She has secret conversations with Hindutva politicians, surprisingly sharing their innermost thoughts with a Muslim journalist. Either I am to believe the Hindutva politicians are really not communal, or she is imagining things. <br/><br/>
In either case, lets be clear that Kashmiriyat is not alive and well in the Valley. The Valley's Muslims have more blood on their hands than the Modi of 2002. As the extremists evicted Hindus, the Valley's Muslims did nothing. For way more than 72 hours. Given the BJP aversion to article 370, the Valley's Muslims wouldn't have voted for BJP anyway, and they didn't. A pity, because the revocation of 370 would have forced the Kashmiris to live side by side with people from the rest of India, and they might actually have had the chance to learn the meaning of that long word: Kashmiriyat.

                            Hi Rana!! By posturing to Valley Muslims same things which NC, PDP, INC lready giving, how BJP going to be different? Now they have support of Jammu and have become key local players. If they combine this with good development centric governance in J&amp;K (may be with PDP), the Valley will then know BJP's intention is only Pan-India Development. Then they'll understand how they've been short changed all these years by so called 'Kashmiriyat' parties.

                            For a moment when you would think that at least for once the politicians have not used religion to garner votes, we have journalists like yourself who would miss it so very much and will actually beat the trumpet of how hindus voted religiously. I dont know why the insinuation from such 'articles' is always that voting for one party makes hindus criminals and communal. It does not matter to you when muslims vote for SP and RJD en mass in the states where they are wooed shamelessly by these parties. They are only the abused minority which are pushed to the wall and so scared of BJP that they have no choice. There is no point in reminding you the modern or medieval history of kashmir; that will not take venom out of you. One sees what she wants to see. If there is any community in India which has been driven out of their homeland, it is kashmiri hindus. I am sure you will not even blink when muslims in gujarat vote for congress. Is that not communal by your standards? And when it comes to abuse, gujarati muslims are not sunni bohras or muslim patels but in kashmir, we have only pandits and no hindus. As if the terrorists sang love songs with sikhs and other hindus and only went after the pandits. It is only naughty that you dont address them as kashmiri hindus.<br/>
But its not all wrong with the article. I really appreciate that you did not use the term migrants for hindus living in the valley. NDTV anchors and correspondents are shamelessly using this term for the hindus living in kashmir. Are they migrants? No thats where they have been living perhaps for centuries. Journalism I guess is one profession where you are accountable to nobody, not even to your inner conscience.

                            She is on mission to try weaken BJP as much she can by blowing hot air. Her start about a BJP guy saying pep free Kashmir was to not let BJP and pdp combine. She tried hard same in Maharashtra also to not let shiv Sena combine by blowing poison among them. With such design I have to regretfully say that she is a minority which want modi out, and need to be shown door. I say for a few give her articles ZERO hit so that she is thrown out of this crap every 2 weeks or so.

                            Well, I think the author makes a few valid points, but the point she is missing here is what BJP has achieved in this election is commendable. Winning 25 seats in the only Muslim-majority state in the country is something that BJP would take any day. Unlike PDP, which has seen its vote bank in Kashmir being divided among Congress and NC, BJP has emerged as the preferred party for the people of Jammu. As far as forging an alliance is considered, BJP is well within its rights to do so. It has got only got 3 seats lesser than PDP; so, why should it not make an attempt to form the government.

When Modi tries to ensure inclusive growth irrespective of religion these dogs have problems because they fear that butcher shops will be closed and they may have to earn their bone.<br/><br/>

When Shiv Sena Talks of Marathi asmita (Call it Maharaashtriyat if you want), all SECULARS condemn it as Narrow Minded Sectarian thinking. But when it comes to "Kasmiriyat" all the SECULARS go weak in their knees. And again talking of Pandits is immediately put in "COMMUNAL" category! <br/>
In the author's language J&amp;K is the only "Muslim Majority state" which may be ruled by BJP!! So what's the problem? BJP is an officially registered Political party. And Since when did we start defining states on religious lines? <br/>
That's what is "INDIAN SECULARISM" all about.

                            Rana should refrain from using such words as 'betrayal' when talking about Modi.  This is deeply offensive to a vast majority of Indians.  She should also refrain from implying that she is aware of what Intelligence Bureau people have told third parties without showing the evidence that she is party to such knowledge.  That said, Rana should be aware that the BJP is a practical party aware of and ready to deal with ground realities.  Having a mission and fulfilling that mission are two different things.  Remember, a year ago nobody would have given Modi a chance to achieve outright victory in India followed by victories in various states.  It is only a question of time before Kashmir's development is such that far from separatists wishing to leave India, we shall have Pakistanis fighting to enter India so that their families could have a better life.  Am I fantasising?  Well, just have a look at the number of Bengalis from the sovereign state of Bangladesh trying to enter India to enjoy a better life in India.  Pakistan is a failed state; why would any sane person want to live in a failed state when there are better prospects in India?

                            IGenerally I admire Rana and her journalism. Now she is telling us that Kashmir is not about polarisation and NC and PDP did not play religious card before BJP! Come on, even a little kid will not be fooled by this. I am ashamed of BJP's attitude and hindutva as ideology. However remember, Kashmir valley showed hatred towards Hindus, suppressed Jammu and Ladakh which has brought this day (of BJP's massive win) for them. Protests by Kashmiri xenophobes against Amarnath land transfer is not a forgotten tale. If Kashmiriyat (which is nothing but islamiyat in right context) is not about shameless majoritarianism then what is? Hate begets hate, nothing else.

                            I would advise you to get into the history of kashmir elections before the terrorism started i.e 80s or 70s.Dont get into the hype of kashmiryat or insaniyat as it may suit to politicians but not journalists who need to be on real pitch when it comes to actual Kashmir story.Coming back to 80s and 70s,let me say bluntly that in valley particularly srinagar(around dal lake where all journos love to be on job) has never been a region of insanyat or jamhuriat for national political heavy weights.Let me quote you few realities which may be an eye opener for you and many more born post 80s in kashmir.<br/>
1.Mufti mohd syeed today cm candidate never won in this region when he was congress president despite being a muslim,the reason being he belonged to INDIRA GANDHI party who represented hindus only by name.Once he had to hold a public rally in srinagar at polo ground ,but ended up in taking refuge in a sikh gurdwara just to save his life.I remember this as my uncle was also part of that event.<br/>
2.Once Indira Gandhi had to address a small public gathering near university ground,fully naked followers of faroq abdulah and late molvi faroq came to near her stage and finally she had to abandon.One can ask if that was a jihad of 80s as being without weapons or seeds of actual jihad which unfolded in late 80s.My only reason to this is the 1st killing of Kashmir Tick lal taploo the bjp member who would contest the habakdal seat.<br/><br/>
This locality(srinagar) has a hardcore root of anti-delhi created by that time abdullas,jamatis which ultimately led mufti to leave congress.<br/>
So in todays scenario if a party like bjp which doesnt need any criticism more than it already has all the way from delhi to kashmir attempts something in valley or has done some foundation for future must not be rejected by eloping mission 44 which a common analyst was skeptical or had ruled out on day 1, but cant say anything why jounos are still holding unrealistic facts or figures like the mission 44.<br/>
I hope you hold your opinion of BETRAYAL OF KASHMIRIAT till the right time comes.

                            Its all about perception..you may look at it as a loss for BJP's mission 44 but the achievement speaks for itself. They are just 3 short of PDP and a recognized party now in the state. To begin with Jammu has majorly supported them.<br/>
In the context of 'Kashmiriyat' you cannot keep ignoring Jammu and Ladakh. The increase in voting numbers was due to solely BJP .. the pros voted and the 'scared' antis voted. So give points to BJP for making this happen. <br/>
Its very ironical to see eminent political writers to completely evade the other side of the coin just to prove their point. Polarization of votes on religious grounds is also done by PDP,NC &amp; Cong since ages in the valley.If minority voters in India always look for security first while voting a party, it is the Hindu minorities which has expressed the same feeling by voting for BJP in Jammu. <br/>
Kashmir is an issue still persisting in India because of the follies of decision makers post independence and its time it gets resolved because for 60% of population another 40% cannot be suffering for years and years.<br/>
Its time Kashmiriyat not be restricted and gauged by the sentiments of just the Valley.<br/>

                            I don't understand this. She says "Kashmiriyat means treating every son of Jammu and Kashmir as a rightful heir to the idea of India.". That's correct.  Now how do we do that? We integrate J&amp;K into India so that all of what India has, is available to them 100% just like every other Indian. If the insist on "special status" then obviously they will be treated different. Why can't the get this simple fact ? I wonder if all this is a smokescreen and what they really desire is an Islamic state - which they won't get if they join India. And hence all this hullabaloo.

                            Accept the vote of the people of J&amp;K and try to understand the results. There was a large turnout of voters in this election and the surge of Hindu nationalism since the BJP came to power under Modi was one reason.The BJP did not win a single seat in the Kashmir valley. The vote was clearly along communal lines.  J&amp;K is a part of India and I am no fan of Pakistan. India is a secular democracy and although Hindus are a majority, it is not a Hindu state. Some fundamentalist Hindus want to re-write history and convert people to Hinduism. Some BJP leaders have made communal comments recently. This is the biggest danger that India faces as a nation. Mr. Modi needs to address this and let his views clearly known instead of choosing to keep quiet.<br/>
The BJP can choose not to align itself with the NC or the PDP to form a government and work on building up it's base in the Kashmir valley for the next election. But what if it does align itself with one of these parties? What will our learned commentators say about the BJP then? Just because the author is a muslim does not mean that she is wrong. India and democracy come first - not religion!

                            Seriously guys, most of us didn't know her before her articles were published on this site. Just waiting for her big strike with her book on "The PM" Narendra Modi. Now think guys, what best she can do to remain in limelight until then? Yes, you guessed it right ;-)

What do you expect no body goes into alliance and then we get a hung assembly and one year later again re-elections or ONLY the SICKULAR forces are entitled with the right to form alliance post election?<br/><br/>
I wonder which award was given to this lady.

                            So what restrained the PDP/NC from mission 44 and unable to convince jammu? Islamiyat in the name of kashmiriyat?

                            We need to be very careful of liberal, secular, intellectuals and media personalities, they will try to create cracks and distrust between BJP NCP and PDP

                            I fully agree wth P.Srikanth as below: quote:<br/>
The author needs to seriously introspect within her before coming up with such stuff. Everyone knows that the NC and PDP have played to the separatists when it suited them. The author should not let her religion influence her perspectives or else at least not call herself an investigative journalist unquote

                            The single point agenda of Rana Ayub - criticism and castigation of BJP in some way or the other. I haven't seen a "committed" journalist like her in my lifetime. Keep it up. Because the more you criticise, more will it grow. BTW, I m still awaiting an article from her denouncing  her former Boss, Tarun Tejpal

                            Rana Ayub, how much do you know about kashmiriyat, i think it is a fashion to get into limelight by such fake reporting. The most fake community in the whole world is Kashmiri's itself

                            I hope people sees this result with open mind valley didn't vote for BJP which is important to understand u just can't ignore this fact the Muslims rejected BJP's model of growth as they see BJP as mouthpiece of RSS, VHP &amp; BAJRANGDAL which people have to realize u may say that they r best under present circumstances but    for long term they can't rule without including the second largest community of this country otherwise there won't be growth there will be violence its very unfortunate that if this this country votes based on religion which these results clearly shows

                            Hi Rana, there are people who call spade as spade, you are one of them, India need more people like you. Chamchagiri let it be BJP or Congress will keep them in deep freezer, you are in fact warming them up. Ignore the headless chickens, India is full of them.

                            I would advise you to get into the history of kashmir elections before the terrorism started i.e 80s or 70s.Dont get into the hype of kashmiryat or insaniyat as it may suit to politicians but not journalists who need to be on real pitch when it comes to actual Kashmir story.Coming back to 80s and 70s,let me say bluntly that in valley particularly srinagar(around dal lake where all journos love to be on job) has never been a region of insanyat or jamhuriat for national political heavy weights.Let me quote you few realities which may be an eye opener for you and many more born post 80s in kashmir.<br/>
1.Mufti mohd syeed today cm candidate never won in this region when he was congress president despite being a muslim,the reason being he belonged to INDIRA GANDHI party who represented hindus only by name.Once he had to hold a public rally in srinagar at polo ground ,but ended up in taking refuge in a sikh gurdwara just to save his life.I remember this as my uncle was also part of that event.<br/>
2.Once Indira Gandhi had to address a small public gathering near university ground,fully naked followers of faroq abdulah and late molvi faroq came to near her stage and finally she had to abandon.One can ask if that was a jihad of 80s as being without weapons or seeds of actual jihad which unfolded in late 80s.My only reason to this is the 1st killing of Kashmir Tick lal taploo the bjp member who would contest the habakdal seat.<br/><br/>
This locality(srinagar) has a hardcore root of anti-delhi created by that time abdullas,jamatis which ultimately led mufti to leave congress.<br/>
So in todays scenario if a party like bjp which doesnt need any criticism more than it already has all the way from delhi to kashmir attempts something in valley or has done some foundation for future must not be rejected by eloping mission 44 which a common analyst was skeptical or had ruled out on day 1, but cant say anything why jounos are still holding unrealistic facts or figures like the mission 44 in todays digital world .<br/>
I hope you hold your opinion of BETRAYAL OF KASHMIRIAT till the right time comes.

                            To Understand the Common man of Kashmir, is in itself the biggest task any politicians has to over come... Thats why till now no one has been ever able to sway a complete majority here esp.ly in the recent times
