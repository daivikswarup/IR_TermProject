Headline::::Outrageous Challenge To Freedom Of Expression



DateTime::::2015-08-12T23:49:00+05:30




                                The show-cause notices sent by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) to three television news channels, NDTV 24x7, Aaj Tak, and ABP News, for so-called violations of the programme code prescribed under the Cable Television Network Rules, 1994 in their coverage of the serious issues arising from the execution of Yakub Memon are a flagrant attempt to stifle constitutionally-guaranteed freedom of speech and expression. The grounds cited - exploiting the central government's power of licensing, and the claimed authority to 'regulate the content' of private satellite television channels - are specious and patently arbitrary and unlawful. In the latest instance, regulation under the guise of enforcing the programme code has become indistinguishable from crude censorship.
 
The instant strong reactions from within and outside the Indian media - from the Editors' Guild of India, the Broadcast Editors' Association, the News Broadcasters Association, press clubs, unions of journalists, newspaper editorials, the chairperson of the Broadcasting Complaints Council of India, and political leaders - are heartening. 
They make it clear that these notices are rightly seen as ominous, signaling intolerance and a clear intent, if not to intimidate, then to send a message to the private broadcast media that they ought not to step out of line on issues that are regarded as sensitive by the ruling party and the central government. The common demand of the news media in this country is that the show-cause notices must be immediately withdrawn and the harassment of the three television channels stopped.
The notices are also connected, inextricably, to the ideology and politics of the Hindu Right, and to the related vision of an autocratic national security state. However perversely, they have brought to the fore, at a sensitive socio-political juncture, three vital issues that need to be resolved on a priority basis. These are 1) the scope of the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution of India in Article 19; 2) the status of free-ranging, critical debate in Indian democracy; and 3) the crucial question of why, and on what basis, the state continues to make an invidious distinction between the print and broadcast media in the latitude of freedom and independence available to them.
The three show-cause notices deal with two separate issues that supposedly fall within the ambit of the programme code that is prescribed under the Cable Television Network Rules, 1994 and has, additionally, been imported into the policy guidelines for the uplinking and downlinking of news and current affairs TV channels. I have read the notice sent to NDTV 24X7 but have had access only to news reports on the notices sent to the other two news channels. 
The notices, taken together, cover three over-broad Rule 6 sections, 6(1)(d), 6(1)(e), and 6(1)(g), prescribed under the programme code:
"No programme should be carried in the cable service which...
6(1)(d): Contains anything obscene, defamatory, deliberate, false and suggestive innuendos and half truths;
6(1)(e): is likely to encourage or incite violence or contains anything against maintenance of law and order or which promote anti-national attitudes...[and]
6(1)(g): Contains aspersions against the integrity of the President and Judiciary." 
The notices sent to Aaj Tak and ABP News relate to the broadcast of a phone-in interview with Chhota Shakeel (or a man claiming to be the gangster), in which he claimed that Dawood Ibrahim was not involved in the 1993 terrorist bomb attacks in Mumbai, described Yakub Memon's execution as "legal murder," and criticised the Government of India for going back on its word that his life would be spared if he surrendered.  
From a journalistic standpoint, one is entitled to question the relevance and news value of airing Chhota Shakeel's views on this matter; personally speaking, as a former newspaper Editor, I would not feature them as an "exclusive," beyond giving his assertions perhaps a few lines in a news report or analytical article. But I recognize that another editor, especially a television editor, might see news value in this phoned-in 'exclusive' and play it quite differently. 
In any case, presenting interviews with extremists, armed insurgents, war mongers, gangsters, drug lords, and others beyond the pale of law is very much part of the practice of free-wheeling, independent journalism round the world. You don't go after the messenger when an insurgent or extremist or outlaw says something outrageous or unpleasant to hear. It is worth recalling that the Indian news media, newspapers as well as private television channels, have presented extended interviews with major insurgent or extremist leaders without encountering any problem from authorities. I have done this myself when Velupillai Prabhakaran, supremo of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, was in hiding in Chennai and in Jaffna.
Recently, India's leading business daily published the transcript of a telephone conversation that Mushtaq 'Tiger' Memon had with his mother just before his brother was hanged. The English translation of the conversation had the gangster swearing deadly revenge: "This is the height of injustice, this will not go to waste...I will make them pay." The conversation, however it was leaked, had news value. Its publication could be shown to be in the public interest, which would override any right to privacy the old lady, who was shown to be in a pathetic state and most reluctant to come on the line, had. But the point is that no one in authority made any fuss about it, let alone allege that it was "likely to encourage or incite violence or contains anything against maintenance of law and order or which promote anti-national attitudes" or that it contained "aspersions against the integrity of the President and Judiciary." Why? Because the rules of the game are quite different for the print media. 
Nobody in their right mind would say that by broadcasting the phone-in interview with Chhota Shakeel, Aaj Tak and ABP News were supporting or endorsing his views. On the contrary, to put it mildly. Indian news television has certainly broadcast many voices in favour of the hanging.
But it is the show-cause notice sent to NDTV 24x7 that gives away the I&B Ministry's ideologically and politically charged game. I first read the notice closely, researched the programme code prohibitions being cited, and then viewed online, more than once, the Sreenivasan Jain programme, "Truth Vs. Hype: The Riddle of Yakub Memon," which was being targeted and which I had missed when it was telecast on August 1. 
It turns out that MIB was now going after one of the more thoughtful, researched, fair-minded, and well-presented examinations in the Indian news media of the 'riddle of Yakub Memon.' The NDTV 24x7 programme, conceived and anchored by an experienced journalist, was an independent and critical attempt to penetrate the 'mystery' of Yakub Memon's return from his safe haven in Pakistan to face Indian justice and, incidentally, to look at the nature and extent of his culpability in the 1993 Mumbai bomb attacks, and also the quality and effectiveness of the legal assistance he got. It had little or no editorialization by the channel, not that there would have been anything objectionable in that. 
I have the following list of people who are interviewed, or have a say, in the programme: Anand Grover, Yakub Memon's lawyer, who comments on the lost cause with poignant dignity; Maseeh Rehman, a journalist who has impressive knowledge of the details of this case and raises troubling questions; Shyam Keswani and Niteen Pradhan, lawyers, and Madhu Trehan, who all have a brief say on the matter; Shantanu Sen and O.P. Chhatwal, who are given more than fair time to contest the criticisms and answer the questions and have a good deal to say in favour of the CBI; and Majid Memon, well-known lawyer and Nationalist Congress Party M.P., who takes direct issue with the justice of Yakub's execution but surprisingly applauds the Supreme Court of India for "having at least afforded to him...the last opportunity at 3 am."
The MIB's show-cause notice quotes, accurately, Majid Memon as saying (towards the end of the programme): "Usmaan Khan is an approver in this case, who is PW 2 in the trial, OK! Now this Usmann Jaan Khan has been pardoned. If you show this pardon to any person outside India, UK authorities or the best brains in the world as far as criminal law is concerned, they will laugh at you. They will laugh at you; they'll say is this justice? Usmaan Jaan Khan has played a role in this whole operation ten times more than Yakub Ibrahim; he's pardoned...But I should not be misunderstood because I'm not holding Yakub's brief, nor am I finding, criticizing the findings of the highest court to which I must bow down. And I say that I salute the Supreme Court for having at least afforded to him...the last opportunity at 3 am." 
The MIB's show-cause notice in this case alleges, mystifyingly, that "what is being purportedly stated as facts gives vent to apparent half-truths which may be deliberate and defamatory" and thus runs foul of 6(1)(d). It fails to specify which part of the statement it considers 'half-truths' or 'defamatory'. The absurd, and indeed perverse, implication of this sweeping charge is that everything anyone says on news television should be full and guaranteed truth, and nothing else should be telecast. 
The second allegation, made in terms of 6(1)(g), is so absurd that it seems to verge on comedy: "NDTV 24x7 allowed transmission of such content which not only questioned the judicial system of India but tended to denigrate the very institution by hinting that it was not at par with the judicial systems existing in the UK and US. After casting all kinds of aspersions, NDTV 24x7 goes on to show how the statement quoted above merely ends with the words that he bows down to the judgement." 
Have not the authors of the show-cause notice ever read Indian newspapers - their editorials and other opinion pieces on the judiciary, sound and unsound court judgments in sensitive causes, the occasional miscarriage of justice, the law's delays, the strengths and weaknesses of the Indian judicial system relative to other judicial systems, and so forth? Have they not read what Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer, one of India's great jurists and progressive humanists, had to say about such issues in newspaper columns? Have they not read in the press the troubling questions about Yakub Memon's execution, addressed to the President and to the Supreme Court of India? Majid Memon, the experienced criminal lawyer who knew what he was talking about, was well within his constitutional rights to say what he did in the NDTV 24x7 programme. I would add the comment that what he said in the end verged on obsequiousness, for whatever reason.
This brings me to my concluding point, a point that has been made in several newspaper editorials, learned papers, and reasoned debates over the years. Freedom for the Indian news media is incomplete, with a big hole in it. In the eyes of the state, it is not applicable to the broadcast media, whether they are state-owned or private. Remedying this situation for the private satellite television channels at this stage has become an urgent democratic imperative. As an editorial in The Hindu recently argued: "While print publications in India have been allowed a wide degree of freedom of expression in consonance with the constitutional provisions, broadcast channels have not been given the same leeway as in addition to the general laws they are also governed by the broadcast code that regulates content...the distinction appears invidious...Both types of media serve the same purpose of informing and promoting public discussions of issues, necessary in a democratic society. It is dangerous for the power to regulate broadcasting to be vested in the I&B Ministry that can block content that is not to the liking of the government, using the broadly framed content code. The distinction between the print and broadcast media should be removed and the broadcast medium allowed in full the freedom of expression guaranteed under the Constitution."
There is a misapprehension that the "freedom of speech and expression" guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) does not apply to content that is broadcast. What the Supreme Court of India has held is that "an unrestricted right to licensing of broadcasting" cannot be read into Article 19(1)(a), I would add for reasons that no longer hold, if they ever did. The real mischief lies in the practical arrangement, the licensing power assumed by the central government's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting - rather than an independent regulator - to 'regulate,' that is, censor, content and to impose onerous and absurd terms and obligations, through the content code, as a pre- and accompanying condition for giving permission to broadcast. It is time this particular mischief against constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech and expression was challenged in the highest court in the land, and the big hole in media freedom in India closed.  (The author is Chairman and Publisher of The Hindu group of newspapers.)    Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            This is funny. If the SC thinks it is contempt of court, it can take a suo motto cognizance and issue a notice to *all* the channels (not just handpicked 3 as Modiji did). Same applies to President. Who is this lowly I&amp;B minister to bat for the CJI and President, the constitutional heads of India?!

It is up to the common man to isolate this fringe and destroy it completely so that the Nation heads towards peace and prosperity and not towards the dark ages.

                            BJP has only one argument, branding opposition to its ideology as anti-national. BJP only has copyright of Nationalism despite 1) Sushma Swaraj favoring national fugitive 2) Modi telling world that prior to 2014 Indians felt ashamed to accept their nationality 3) Doing all anti-national work of floating Jumlas to fool common man 4) Curbing freedom of expression of Indians living in India. What is this Nationalism in which you are going to stifle Indian common man?

If you want to survive you need to do 'boot licking' to Hindutva forces, RSS &amp; Modi. Otherwise they will harass everyone like Theista stalvad.

                            Sir, Clearly below rule of the program code was violated. There were numerous instances where clear aspersion were made against the integrity of both President and Judiciary (even the Supreme Court). Phrases like "travesty of justice" "Bias against Muslim" etc were used against Supreme Court and President's decision which clearly undermines sanctity of these institutes. <br/><br/>
6(1)(g): Contains aspersions against the integrity of the President and Judiciary."<br/><br/>
This extravaganza was nothing but a shameless rat race to gather TRPs and advertisements which has created saint out of a monster and sowed the seed into the minds of a particular community that a grave injustice has been done to them. Who knows who is planning a revenge for this holding grudge, in fact judges has already received revenge threats for his brother.<br/><br/>
Please remember, freedom comes with a sense of responsibility which is clearly absent from our media these day and it needs a definite introspection.

                            Don't try to justify your anti-India stance by fronting the freedom of speech argument.  I live in the oldest democracy in the world and what you guys have let loose in India would not be tolerated for an instant in any other country.  We are appalled at the irresponsibility exercised by the so-called media in India and the sense of entitlement it feels to behave with impunity.  This is a very good gesture by the government.  We can only hope for more of this.

                            The media does not talk about those 247 etc killed by the 1993 explosions. The supreme court had pronounced its judgement and the Government went by that. Let us not politicize this in the name of religion. A crime is a crime and should be viewed as such. Capital punishment is gruesome to say the least but the sort of comments from pseudo intellectuals in a group of four or five that will sit around a table and telecast their discussions for all to see their intellectual prowess is agonizing to say the least. These guys can contest elections and run the country in more sane manner if they feel so and have the will to work for social cause.<br/>

Indians today expressed our confidence in modi whom you called dangerous to society and your "Hindu" newspaper always try to undermine people's verdict which was always in favour of modi. On one hand you criticize Mamata's singur protest but at the same time you support chinese model of governance.

                            No question that freedom of expression needs to be protected and the media can play an important role. Others have asked the media to monitor itself and not go overboard or play into the hands of mischief makers. Mr Ram and many others of his ilk roar like lions when it comes to the tiniest transgression or even misstep by the BJP (or anyone perceived as 'right wing', 'Hindutva'). However, they are all as quiet and unseen as a mouse when it comes to major transgressions by others. Case in point - in his home state, the government has filed more than 110 criminal defamation suits against the media. Have we seen such a thundering response from Ram or his fellow travellers? Not a peep sir

                            In india freedom of expression is widely misused by media,and they dont  want to be get criticised or get notices.Indian laws should be changed in a such way that always truth is exposed. and culprit media should be punished.Half truth and half baked news like lalit gate,vasundhara and vyapam scam has cost govt tax payers  money 450 crores in this two week monsoon session.I have one request nowadays so many media houses are there but during Bofors scams,union carbide-anderson,quittrochi escape to malaysia there were no tv channels that to expose only centre run doordharshan and the hindu and indian express have exposed these scams but it easily neutralised by congress government.

                            Hello, <br/>
Media can question anyone and every one in India but dare nobody should question them. There is a notice and you just need provide your reply and justification or basis on which you carried out this whole episode of Yakub Hanging. That's all. What is the big deal here? Also one should remember "freedom of expression, speech etc. comes with some sense of responsibility". You freedom to swing arms stops at a point where someone's nose starts. Dear media please be responsible in your reporting. Headline like "They handed Yakoob" do cause generate and promote anti-national attitudes. Especially minorities have a victimized feeling in India and one shouldn't make them feel more victimized.<br/>
NDTV - If you are really sincerely stand for freedom of expression, please post this comment.

Killing an earstwhile communist leader like TP chandrasekharan in kerala for openly challenging the leadership of Pinarayi vijayan is the freedom you are talking ? Freedom to denigrate the Hindu culture to appease your pentacost wife is the freedom you are talking about? Do you enjoy the freedom to oppose the master plan of your pentacost mission to proselatyse the hindu thru your wife ? Before preaching to others try to liberate yourself from your narrow minded communist obscurantism.

                            Sounds very clearly an article by a very insecure employee who might lose his job and will not have salary to meet his monthly expense. Mr Ram should not worry about such things. He is in a job, which does not get affected by recession. He is in a profession, where he can say anything and get away. He can apply the rule of 'damn if you do and damn if you don't' to the entire world with absolutely no accountability on his part. So why such insecurity. Hope he relaxes.

                            There is no doubt that most of indian media is anti hindu. Otherwise questioning a highest court judgement with religious bias is nothing but outrageous and anti constitutional. Freedom of speech does not mean spreading ill will among the citizens invoking religious bias is highly condemnable. This can happen only in India.

                            Dear Mr.Ram having seen you all along with high regards I am surprised with the way u have missed out on the basic facts of the matter, which a normal citizen like me could see. Irrespective of the fact whether it was ruling BJP/congress<br/><br/>
6(1)(e): is likely to encourage or incite violence or contains anything against maintenance of law and order or which promote anti-national attitudes...[and]<br/><br/>
6(1)(g): Contains aspersions against the integrity of the President and Judiciary." <br/><br/>
In my opinion the reporting was in violation of these 2 without much knowledge on law.<br/><br/>
A Supreme court Judge had given the Judgement and then 3 different benches of Judge from SC has upheld the same to add further it was the same judgement given by Session court and upheld by High Court. Further President has rejected the mercy petition and the media houses reported it is a bias towards muslims, how can anyone justify this? Commenting on Government and heads of government is always part and parcel of almost all the democratic nation but not on the decision of a constitutional authority. I really feel bad that such an article came from you.

                            Mr. Ram needs freedom to do anything including propagating our enemy's speech. He has acted as if he has been appointed agent of China in our country. He is arrogant and he thinks his view is the only correct one. Why he is anti-Hindu and anti-Indian.

                            Dear Mr Ram,<br/><br/>
You have a powerful media house. Please open a department to provide justice. Since you consider all powerful, you should able to get the necessary rating. Then you start giving verdicts. <br/><br/>
Until such time please allow the courts to function and need not comment on its verdict. Millions of people still have faith on the judiciary and President. Your comments are only to increase your TRP rating and not speaking to create awareness. <br/><br/>

                            Freedom of expression is farce. Uneducated does not deserve freedom. People should be qualified to get some freedom. It should be restricted for the good of the country and society. Media always propagate negativity in the name of freedom of expression. Ram Hegde, Vapi

                            While it is patently wrong to find fault with the SC's verdict without knowing the facts of the case, the broader issue is whether political / populist considerations influence prosecution.<br/><br/>
We have seen many riots that gave claimed the lives of thousands from various communities. The quality and intensity of prosecution has not been uniform and this has led to perpetrators of serious crime going scot-free or receiving (relatively) light sentences.<br/><br/>
Isn't that a huge injustice to the victims of those riots too? And doesn't selectivity (real or perceived) lead to polarisation and in some cases, extremist tendencies?<br/><br/>
Also earnest commenters who consider the execution "closure for victims" are sadly mistaken: Most victims / families have received little to no assistance from various govts since '93.<br/><br/>
Almost every victim / family member interviewed has stated the govts have done nothing for them. <br/><br/>
While carrying out the sentence is very important, compensation / assistance is just as important to give victims / families hope for the future.<br/><br/>
People in power and institutions need to give this serious thought to ensure lasting peace and happiness in our country.

As, stupid are these notices to media houses, it is also stupid for the media houses and intellects to mix-up the two separate issues of 'debate against death penalty' and 'debate against Yakub's hanging' in certain programs. Social media already sensationalizes lot of issues, at least print and news media should should act more responsibly, at least when they know this type issues can really flare-up fast. <br/><br/>
Your point 2) the status of free-ranging, critical debate in Indian democracy - Having back to back debates for 3 hours on the same topic for a week, do you think this persons hanging, really needed a critical debate?

                            Naxalites and perverts are taking advantage of the democratic system to justify bombings and other terrorist acts.  They are expressing their opinion even after Supreme court has disposed off the case.  The media is interested in stirring up controversies for 1. The wrong  presumption that it increases viewership. 2. The media is controlled by political outfits or foreigners who are interested in showing the incumbent government in bad light. 3. The media has naxal sympathizers, leftists and other jihadi and anti social elements who are intent on starting ISIS type revolution in India.<br/>
Government should take strict action against jihadi supporters in the national media.

                            Mr. Ram himself  says that "But I recognize that another editor, especially a television editor, might see news value in this phoned-in 'exclusive' and play it quite differently. "  So why he is criticizing the fact that there are different standards for print &amp; television? Media plays all issues differently. In  the present case of Yakub's punishment , the question is 'what was media doing in last 20 years when the Yaakub was waiting to be hanged? why it had to rake up issues at the moment of hanging?

                            The media must behave responsibly and should ideally present all points of view to let people form an informed opinion. <br/><br/>
However, like any other entity, media houses too are coloured by various biases (subtle and not so subtle). While the people / authorities must call out media houses in cases of biased / false reporting, we must not encourage / permit taking anyone to task merely for presenting contrarian views.<br/><br/>
For example, a debate on capital punishment does not constitute questioning the Supreme Court or the govt's intentions. And more often than not, media houses are going to bring this up when an event such as a hanging or a presidential pardon happens as that's when public interest peaks (which ultimately determines viewership / revenue).<br/><br/>
Media corporations are owned by industrialists (e.g. Mukesh Ambani) who like any other group have their own (political / ideological) leanings. It is illogical to assume that all mainstream media is acting in concert against a particular party.<br/><br/>
It would be great if people take an issue-based approach and evaluate / pull up channels / publications on the facts of each issue, rather than painting everyone black or white.

                            Sir being an aspirant  journalist i can say that media should have full autonomy and also our constitution<br/>
Have provided this power as its fourth pole,but where <br/>
Is the consern of this news channel notice by this government, my opinion is diffrent from other  the time<br/>
Has come that electronic media should also be controlled <br/>
by press council of india and when toi took interview<br/>
Of chhota sakil no one send notice,why?<br/>
I can also answer this queastion because toi has educated reader or an educated person can read and he<br/>
 will not take any wrong step but in news channel this<br/>
 Case is different an educated and non -educated <br/>
both can watch and understand and now a days <br/>
Electronic media creating perception that may be <br/>
wrong perception, can create more problem because<br/>
We are living with minority  also, may be it could <br/>
Mislead them so  my opinion is that electronic media<br/>
Should be sensitive it self.

                            I think it is wrong for media to project Yakub as a martyr. Media in the guise of freedom of speech can not be allowed and do damage to the society. Either they should restrain themselves ,which obviously not done ,then I&amp;B minister has responsibility towards society and country ,to question the media.I do not think there is nothing wrong in it and media should behave with responsibility.

                            Media can question anyone and every one in India but dare nobody should question them. There is a notice and you just need provide your reply and justification or basis on which you carried out this whole episode of Yakub Hanging. That's all. What is the big deal here? Also one should remember "freedom of expression, speech etc. comes with some sense of responsibility". You freedom to swing arms stops at a point where someone's nose starts. Dear media please be responsible in your reporting. Headline like "They handed Yakoob" do cause generate and promote anti-national attitudes. Especially minorities have a victimized feeling in India and one shouldn't make them feel more victimized.<br/>

                            Entirely agree that the act of giving notices for an opinion expressed is bad. However just wish to point out that the responsibility of the media houses is not to only show something sensational but exercise some caution as regards the consequences of the acts of such shows. I am sure there are sensibilities which can be stung leading to a reaction which can be detrimental to peace. Raw truth can not be digested easily every time.

The owners want their Agenda to be pushed forward.Mr.Arvind Kejriwal caught some on sting operations.So do not try to blame the Government.It is the responsibility of the Government to control.If you have any problems, please go to the court but not to criticize the Government.Wisdom lies in this.
