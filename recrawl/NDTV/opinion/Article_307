Headline::::Dear Smriti, Please Act Your Age

                                (Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer. She is working on a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi which will be published in 2015.)Ten years ago, on December 12, actress and BJP worker Smriti Irani made a scathing attack on then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, demanding his resignation over his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots. Having lost the election from the Chandni Chowk seat in Delhi, Smriti, who made her debut in politics that year, claimed that Modi had embarrassed party stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his legacy by not following "rajdharm". Speaking to the media in Surat, Smriti announced that she would fast unto death and her agitation would begin on 25th December, the birthday of Vajpayee, in an attempt to redeem his name and his honour. She had to retract her statement that very evening over mounting pressure from the BJP leadership.A decade later, Smriti Irani, at 38, is the country's youngest HRD minister. For Vajpayee's birthday this year, she wanted a series of events organized at educational institutions as part of "Good Governance Day", first spoken of by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The opposition's combined attack in part forced Smriti's rushed defence that schools could choose to participate in the celebrations, but were not obliged to. Â I have always considered Smriti Irani to be among the more sensible spokespersons and young leaders in the Indian polity, something I concluded on the basis of her arguments on TV debates and personal conversations I had with this affable and talented actress from Indian television.Three years ago, while writing an edit on the banning of a 60-year-old cartoon on Ambedkar from textbooks, I spoke to an agitated Irani who was concerned over the impact such cartoons would have on the impressionable minds of her school-going kids. The forceful arguments she made and her strong rhetoric on news channels seems hollow now when placed in the context of decisions by her Ministry. The HRD ministry is responsible for shaping the thoughts and views of young generations, but Smriti's dilemma in balancing what has been suggested are her own liberal views and the Sangh's diktat has created a mess. One could have forgiven the minister for a few misgivings, but Smriti has her platter full. From giving an audience right after taking office to Dinanath Batra and offering to look into his charter of demands, to seeking Sanskrit be compulsory as third language, her education agenda seems to be far from liberal and evolved. Sample some of the gaffes and controversies she has triggered in the last six months.On being appointed as HRD minister, questions about Smriti's own educational qualifications were raised because of differing accounts in affidavits. Rather than being upfront about her ability to hold an office of great responsibility, she spoke of having a degree from Yale. At a media event, she was quoted saying "In that kitty of mine where people call me 'anpad' (illiterate) I do have a degree from Yale University as well which I can bring out and show how Yale celebrated my leadership capacities". She was soon forced to clarify that the degree was actually for a six-day event at Yale which honoured achievers from all fields. Smriti was an accomplished actress, she did qualify as an achiever. Whether her stint there paralleled a degree in education, Smriti, as HRD minister, should have known better.When Dinanath Batra (the same man who wants us to return to Vedic times) asked her to completely overhaul the system as President of NCERT and work on a CBSE syllabus on the lines of the RSS agenda and its idea of history, Smriti promised to give it a look. One would have expected her to have known that these gestures would send out confusing signals.Her idea of modernizing education was questioned when she asked Kendriya Vidyalayas to stop teaching German and introduce Sanskrit as a compulsory third language. Smriti should have known that in the last decade, Aspiring India, a term given by her Prime Minister, had seen a rise of 114 percent in the number of students going to Germany for education, with the country being the most sought after by Indian students of college-going age. Sanskrit, which is a part of our cultural heritage, needed to be given importance, but giving students the liberty to choose between Sanskrit and German would not have affected its glorious legacy.Recently, Aligarh was used as a ground to create controversy, first over allowing girl students to attend the Central library and later over the decision by Sangh affiliates to celebrate the birth anniversary of Jat king Raja Mahendra Pratap for political purposes. Once again, Irani's naivette was on display with her knee-jerk decision of cutting funds to the university without having ascertained the true facts which later came to light. Her naivette transformed into silence over the BJP's decision to use the AMU ground for a political fight.Her list of questionable achievements is expanding. The National Research Professorship scheme honours and recognizes distinguished and renowned academics from all over the country to honour their contribution to the field of education. Last week the HRD ministry considered three RSS sympathizers. According to a media report, the three names suggested were: Prof S L Bhyrappa whose novels project Tipu Sultan as a religious fanatic; Dr Ashok Gajanan Modak, lecturer and BJP Member of the Legislative Council in Maharashtra; and Surya Kant Bali, a journalist and RSS sympathiser whose book was recently released by RSS Joint General Secretary Dr Krishna Gopal, coincidentally in the presence of Irani. When Smriti Irani assumed power, the young leader promised the country of a reformed approach to education and an increase in spending on the sector along with higher educational reforms. One could see great promise from her assertive rhetoric and it was felt that she would take over from Murli Manohar Joshi, her predecessor from the NDA government in 2004. It would be pertinent to remember that Joshi, one of the most high profile Sangh men who held the reins to the HRD a decade ago, had asked the UGC to issue a notification to varisities across the country to submit proposals on a course in a rather regressive science of Jyotir Vigyan or Vedic astrology. A decade later, little seems to have changed, not just with the BJP-led HRD but also with Smriti Irani's politics. What is the point of a 38-year-old minister whose thoughts and agenda seem no different from those that belong to relics?Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            BTW, Vedic astrology is not regressive. Ask your own western ilk like David Frawley. It can be an optional course. Its not for no reason our ancestors have developed this. Don't go by todays roadside sooth sayers. And don't come to conclusions on which you are not an authority or try to strengthen your argument by belittling these ancient sciences.

                            Rana Ayyub,<br/><br/>
It is commendable that you are having the thought that India should move forward, however I am unable to understand as to why you would not appreciate anything of India being projected out.<br/>
Clearly, you seem to have an issue with Sanskrit. But please do understand that if you are a true Bharatiya, you should make it a point to know your origin and stand as an ambassador of your culture. International Universities and Schools in Western Countries are testing the waters by introducing Sanskrit in their education. Stories of Ramayan &amp; Mahabharat are being discussed to shape the next generation into idealistic leaders. Soon I would expect patents to be made by them to own such traditional systems which we under the pretext of being "secular and modern" are shunning them. Its a pathetic state of mind of us Indians to shun our rich heritage under pseudo secular views.<br/>
The Honourable minister is currently exploring many options to improvise the retrograding educational system. Change is usually a biggest challenge as it involves the change in the mindset and mental attitude, specially when additional efforts are required of such change. We lost of rich heritage under the 60 years of misruling from Congress. It is after a long era of 3 decades that leadership is strong at the Centre. Human beings are at work and are definitely working for the betterment of the society and make each bharatiya proud of their heritage (which was not there before). Time tells many things.. patience is needed to see the outcome. You had taken many years to grow wise.. everyone deserves the same...

                            Ms ayub..All valid points except "batra wants to take us back to vedic times". This statement does not make sense. Denoting erratic with vedic does not gel: even with a sangh critic like me. Vedas are indeed treasures of metaphysical knowledge and philosophy(with some exceptions). Sanghis have unfortunately hijacked them to further their agenda. Batra cannot be equated with vedic knowledge. .He is a loony; the likes of which are abundant in upper echelons of sangh. Please refrain from making silly mistakes while criticizing, as 1 point can invalidate your entire criticism.

                            Come on Ms.Ayyub,<br/>
You seem to be jealous of Ms.Irani....!Just kidding!!!<br/>
Please consider the following points: <br/>
1. Sanskrit as 3rd language was already promised by the previous UPA Ministry at a Sanskrit meet! Are you aware of that or just don't want to mention (to strengthen your arguments)?<br/>
2. Many Westerners have come to India to study 'Vedic astrology' why not we help some interested men to carry out such studies?? What the hell is wrong in that? Why are you so keen to ban such studies calling them 'retro'????? You want us to rediscover the value of our own science (or say, "systems" if you object to calling them "science") just like we did in cases of Yoga &amp; Ayurveda???? It's in our 'blood', I can say, to belittle our own systems or values!!<br/>
3. Do you know, countless no. of  Congress-sympathizers got awards &amp; accolades, sidelining more deserving candidates in the last 60 years? The shining example being Dr.UR Ananth Murthy (Jnaanapeeth awardee) who openly canvassed for the Congress candidate in the recent 2014 polls.... Just go &amp; do some research on all the writings of Dr.SL Bhyrappa (instead of highlighting just one so-called "Anti-Tipu novel") who was denied a well deserving Jnaanapeeth.<br/>
4. Not many were aware of the Hindu king Raja Mahendra Pratap's link with the 'Muslim University'. It was like remembering the forgotten hero who's contribution was successfully undermined all these years. Without any qualification you call the celebration as to serve a "political purpose". Your jumping into such conclusions simply demonstrates your biased mindset. <br/>
I am strongly of the view that you "take a stand" with a prejudiced mindset. My sincere advise to you, please learn to see things from different angles. Congressmen have out rightly misused power at all levels. BJP govt. is just correcting them now....<br/><br/>
Conflicts of Interest: None (I am not a member of BJP, RSS or so called Sangh Parivar. Neither I am paid by any party or organization)

                            I do agree that some of the decisions have been embarrassing faux pas. However, your argument for German rings a little hollow. Just because Indians are going to Germany to study doesn't mean they should be taught the language. They can learn Sanskrit here and then learn German should their career take them that route. Bigger point, what if the student wants to study in Israel? :)

Of-course all were elected through proper rules and thus eligible for assigned posts. Ask all for results instead of such wrong propaganda which is expected to be funded by less brain people focus on development which UPA failed to do and divided people on basis of anything that is imaginable. Gov. should bring RTI coverage to private agencies like media who are dealing with feeling of people.

                            Good Constructive improvement suggested by Rana Ayyub. One should be allowed to choose the language agreed. But should study their country's language too, in this case its Sanskrit. Take all the European countries, their native language is mandatory to learn. DMK may disagree, but fact remains, we need to learn Sanskrit.

Why all questions get raised when someone converts to Hinduism ? Or where was she when modern day Dhritrashtra, oops, I meant, Manmohan Singh proclaimed that minorities have the first right to all resources of India. Being a part of majority was becoming a crime under Congress. Where were you Ayub Rana, the award winning investigative journalist when our Dhritrashtra was proclaiming the majority as second class citizens of this country.

Implementing Sanskrit as a compulsory 3rd language should be very much favored by Indians. Students are migrating to Germany bcoz it's providing better education and opportunities to the students. German Gov spending and concentrating seriously in its education sector. If Indian gov also gets serious(which at present HRD minister respected Smriti indeed is serious) about raising the quality and standard of Indian education system. HRD Minister respected smt. Smriti, has been taking initiatives for improving the standards an quality of Indian education system so that Indian students have not required to pay exorbitant fees to gain foreign quality education anymore and they can have better quality education in India itself at reasonable fees with several opportunities. If we indians develop our own education system based on our geographical, technological and cultural hierarchy then foreigners from western world will also visit and pursue education in huge numbers in Indian varsities and we too can also generate a huge revenue from education from foreigners as the western world is doing the same presently to boost their economy. Please think logical, in regard of long run impact this would have. Just don't utter all nonsensical Crap "Ms. RANA". Think with nationalistic point of view rather with colonial mindset. Just think with the perspective of our own indian education system on par to Japanese and chinese education system (which have unique identity). Just shed this colonial mindset, we are no more in British era. Changes are necessary that too for our future generation who need to depend on foreign systems. Just think creative so that we can develop our education system which can provide best education and quality at affordable fees in our own language, then we will understand that we need not to take German as 3rd language. And again I favor SMRITI's steps and decisions.

                            Smriti is better than any other HRD minister from Congress, having degrees doesnt make u intelligent or a leader who can achieve. See our MMS, he failed us. Ppl with only degrees can be ministers is fool ppl's arguement. And whats wrong if we learn good things from Veda's? So u think we shld read only abt Gandhi Nehru and after few days Rajiv, Indira, Sonia and Rahul?

                            God knew that the way the UPA and their cronies are going, India would become a Islamic state very soon. Then these jihadists would overtake them and convert all to moslems. So in order in avoid this, they brought in the BJP govt. And see things are turning right and being checked. The only people having a problem are those who wanted to get converted to moslem. very soon you would get an anti-conversion law much to the displeasure of these congi guys.

                            If you do 10 things in your job, you will make mistake with 1. If you slack off at job and do nothing, there you will do no mistake. Smriti Irani is a victim of her own efficiency. In the last 10 years, we have a minister who is working at trail-blazing speed, is very articulate and effective. Unfortunately she being a woman is a soft-target. Since Modi's popularity is rocket high, there are some vested interest who are doing after Smriti Irani. It started on the first day itself over her edu qualification. Rana yyub should be proud that a woman minister has reached such a high position purely on her own merit. Unlike Sonia, Jayalalitha etc, she did not have the advantage of a politically strong father/mother/husband/etc. Unlike Mayawati/Mamta, she is rational and effective. Unfortinately women like Rana Ayub do what women do best - pull other women down.

                            Anybody or everybody is entitled for their views on Mrs Irani and find faults with her. But it is appalling to find the name of  SL Bhyrappa in your reference. Only one story of Bhyrappa has reference of Tippu Sultan and the way he lead a fundamentalist life with historical proofs. Its obvious that the author of this article has not read it and just taken someones views. Tippu Sultan has been heralded by our apologetic secular as great king with secular credentials. But it has been proved that many a doubt lies in his actions to be called secular. Even Janapitha awardee Girish Karnad once regretted having penned and directed a drama of Tippu Sultan that too after reading a story about Tippu. Tippu is described as secular only by politicians, a few comrades and...others.... those just would not agree with facts only to claim to be secular.  If Ms Rana Ayyub has inclination to prove wrong what Bhyrappa first need to read the story then defend and not just commenting like the the others! Anyway proving him wrong would be like finding faults in truth!

                            There had been severe criticism on her appointment as HRD Minister.  Not sure, what canvased PM Modi to keep her in the high responsible position. Being an ILLITERATE (6 days degree count?), wht can we expect out of her? It's unfortunate such faces occur in Modi cabinet. As we accept,Modi being an intelligent personality, he must have found some capability with her, which we don't know.At the end of the day,before it become a big tragedy, it is better to show her way.

If Germany wouldnt recognise English as a common medium but insist on learning its language why shouldn't  India make a case for rekindling its own classic language? Sanskrit sans religious overtones should be taught just like Tamil being insisted. If u r in India youve got to be Indian!

                            The author has taken the issue in a constrictive way but it is interesting to see how the comments are trying to reflect a biasness just because the author happens to be a Muslim. I believe its a constructive criticism to a large extent and what she is trying to point is real gaffe made a young minister. Some of the steps taken by the minister in questions are really questionable. Nobody is asking to prevent Sanskrit being taught in the school but the point was why its been dictated what language student should learn. Learning a foreign language does not mean we are giving away our historical heritage but in fact it creates more opportunity for us to spread the same with a new learn language.

Please remember if they speak of hindutva, they are not wrong. Please read history and if you are a true Indian, you would agree. Kerala, which happened to be gods own country now has 1/3rd population of christians and muslims. How? what happened. Ultimately the forefathers of all the minority community were hindus. There were some lacunae in the rules of the hindus which forced them to convert, but that does not mean you totally change your identity. Even by converting you remained backward in the converted community. what was the change.

                            Rana must be short of work.  So what better than to give Smriti a kicking?  It helps, of course, that she, Smriti cannot defend herself every time an 'award' winning' journo earning her (or his) crust attacks, for were she to do so, she would not have a second to do her job! Rana could, of course, comment on the disgusting behaviour of 'parliamentarians' such as Anand Sharma, Yechuri, Ram Gopal Yadav, Derek O'Brien and various others thugs whose antics are all too evident.  She chooses not to as that will not get her 'brownie points' towards her next award.  Rana constantly refers to Smriti's previous profession of being a thespian in a tone that is a combination of patronisation and derogatory.  She could surely comment on the threatening manner in which Messrs. Derek O' Brien, Sharma and Yechuri in particular speak, with arms flailing and acting as if a fist fight is what they are salivating for.<br/>
A Democracy runs when there is fair scrutiny of both, Government and Opposition.  In Rana's musings, there is no scrutiny of the behaviour of the Opposition and, by implication, they can do no wrong.  Thus, Yechury, a man with little or no mandate from the great Indian public, O' Brien, virtually unknown outside the inner circle of the dreadful Mamata Banarjee and Sharma whose party had its arse kicked by the great Indian public the last time it sought a mandate, get away with it as the likes of Rana take the easy option of kicking those that will not answer back.  A 'Param Vir Chakra' I say, for the bravest of the brave, Rana Ayub!!!

                            Smriti spoke against Modi in 2012 and her actions that followed made it clear that she was from the pro-Vajpayee/Advani camp and not pro-Modi. Tell me which of the anti-Modi camp workers were recognized and awarded with Minister-ship except for Smriti? and why?? The answer is simple: Smriti, I believe, is the blue eyed girl of the RSS and they are solidly behind her. It's no secret that to become a Minister one needs the support of the RSS. In return, all she has to do is carry out the RSS' hidden agenda! This is why she is involved in so many controversies in such a short time and has become so unpopular despite her being a young Minister.

                            Did you know that the one and best known German work around the world, the most famous in German literatire viz. FAUST by Goethe is based on the famous Sanskrit play of Kalidasa - the Abhigyan Shakuntalam. And the most performed play in German theatre is the Mrichhakatikam by Shudrak. They are surprised by the modernity of the Place, time and setting of Ujjaini in which the play is set all those thousands of years ago - yes it was written in that time period and also struck at its similarity in structure and administration with the modern city of today.

                            The country should first understand the real reason behind German cultural mission in India negotiating at the highest levels of previous Indian govt to make German a part of the Indian govt's three language policy in central govt run schools, which was meant to propagate the Indian culture amongst its citizens and to give an equal chance to all students living in a state to grasp the international, the national and the respective states language. <br/>
Why then did Germany push for these indian students to learn their national language at par with English at the highest central govt run educational institution as part of the national Indian three languageolicy for children in school?<br/>
For the simple commercial reason - that USA and UK were benefitting  their IT industry from the cheap Indian worker, and Germany was not able to benefit as these countries did due to the natural advantage of this international language being used as a second language in India. Yes, it was to create more cheap labour for German industry for no extra efforts or expenses. If they needed people to work on their projects (which are very limited in number and scope) they could very well have provided free language training to people working in these IT companies and given them extra sops to work on their country and companies projects. But they tried to create a huge cache of German speakers breeding high supply and competition further decreasing their overall cost of IT projects working through India. And tried to do so through appropriating the Indian govts scheme for promoting three indian languages in India's govt run prestigious central schools. Here the quality of education and the background of students was rich. <br/>
Then is there any pride in letting our policies and our future workforce be used in this manner for some country's personal gains. Or is there some measure of shame in allowing our kids to be exploited in this manner even before they have gained basic education?

                            Every single point criticized by Rana Ayyub is the need of the hour for the nation. Smriti is on the right path if Rana Ayyub criticizes her. The problem will be if Smriti does things that Ayyub praises!

                            The nation needs to know who was responsible in India's previous UPA govt for tweaking the country's  NATIONAL three language policy to include one particular FOREIGN language in it and the big question is WHY?

                            What I like about Smriti is that she does not fear to take tough decisions in a clear-headed manner. Whatever may be her critics opinion, I will go by her astrologer's opinion that she has bright future in politics.

                            Ms. Ayub,<br/>
Why is there a taboo to talk about ancient Indian methodology? Unless we read it, do R&amp;D, Discuss and debate, it would die a slow death as it has been for centuries. Let us bring it to study and see if it can be developed for modern society. If not then bury it forever.<br/>
Otherwise, you always give opportunity to few people to play with sentiments of millions of Hindus who think that their ancestral knowledge has been deprived of in Modern India.<br/>
Who knows, we gain something from old ancient wisdom. Even if, we do not get anything, but no harm in recognizing the fact, Indian had gained wisdom in old times.<br/>
Thanks.

                            I am surprised by the author's uneducated and uncivilized reference to one of Kannada's greatest writers, Byrappa. It is very clear she has neither read nor understood what his life and work have been. Byrappa has at long last shown why the rose tinted account of Bhagwan Gidwani is historically, cultural memory wise and objectively false.

                            Dear Ms Ayyub, Free suggestion, please shift to writing on filmy topics &amp; movie stars.<br/>
One sided writing on important issues are not appreciated in this line. If you are an author, you need to be unbaised, else stop writing for the sake of only being crtical &amp; negative about the govt, as we are intelligent readers. We also understand and know how to anaylsis the stories written by people like you

                            Wonder why just German, won't it be useful for the Kendriya Vidyalaya students to choose a foreign language of their liking to learn at the school level? If the German cultural mission in India is happy to provide training and teachers to them for the purpose, so would the other foreign cultural missions in India be equally happy to provide same for their language learning.

                            Is the German cultural missions interference in the India's central govt's education policy for its future generations justified when it is done for a  personal commercial gain? German IT projects in India did not have the same level of language competency and hence cost saving as did all the US and UK project and the business smart Germans came up with this idea of creating a German speaking very low cost workforce as the Americans had access to and that too for a very small numb of projects, thus further reducing their cost and replace ability of the employee.  The Japanese, the Swiss, the French and all the rest brought their projects into India and either spoke English themselves or hired respective language interpreters on their projects, but never complained nor did they resort to such huge scale manipulation of the Indisn system.

                            The list of Smriti Irani's stupidities has already been given here, but what I don't understand is the authour finding Smriti Irani a sensible spokesperson.<br/>
She must have suddenly lost her sensibilities.<br/>
Ever she became the minister responsible for education she has been troubling the poor kids. <br/>
If the author is to be believed then Smriti is indeed sensible but is acting under directions, an instrument in establishing an ideology. This was preplanned and the unspoken agenda.
