Headline::::Gai Pe Charcha: BJP and Cow Violence



DateTime::::2015-10-20T14:22:00+05:30




                                For nearly three weeks after the Dadri lynching, the Prime Minister, confronted by mounting pressure to respond, oscillated between ducking the issue by keeping silent, turning it into a wider existential clash between Hindus and Muslims, and finally describing it as a 'sad incident' while drawing an administrative distinction: "what do incidents like Dadri," he asked, "have to do with the Centre?"
We are now told that the Prime Minister is "angry" with the incendiary statements made by his party colleagues. They were in turn summoned by party president Amit Shah and given a dressing down. Characteristically, some of them have denied this.
While this may or may not assuage those still awaiting a more convincing response, it isn't quite clear why the Prime Minister is angry. After all, the troops were dutifully following the general's lead.
In the campaign for the national elections, the repeated "pink revolution" references by Mr Modi, then the party's Prime Ministerial candidate, inserted the alarmist, cow-under-attack rhetoric into the national conversation. His primary contention (which underwent mild variations in each speech): the UPA government was promoting the large scale illegal - and immoral - slaughter of cows, thereby bringing in a "pink revolution."
In Bihar, for instance, in a speech on April 2, 2014, he taunted Lalu Yadav, who comes from the caste of gau-palaks (cow rearers) for forging an alliance with a UPA that experiences garv (pride) at the massacre of cattle. By way of proof, Mr Modi spoke of the subsidies to the meat industry given by the UPA, and of the existence of large slaughterhouses everywhere. This, he explained to a crowd in Ghaziabad in Western Uttar Pradesh two days later, is the UPA's pink revolution, which wants ''India to be made the biggest meat exporter," a series of clever distortions and half-truths to conceal the larger lie of the cow in peril.
It is true that India's meat exports have steadily risen in the past several decades. But even as campaigner, Mr Modi would have known that government rules only permit the export of buffalo meat, not cow. Buffalo is technically not classified as beef by the government, even if it is treated as such in some of the countries it is exported to.
The UPA subsidy was for the agri-food export industry as a whole, of which meat export is a component.
As for the possibility of illegal killing of cows in slaughterhouses bound for export, here is what DB Sabharwal, a representative of India's meat exports association had to say: "There are 66 meat processing plants registered with the state and central government, which are only allowed for export. In each of these plants, a government veterinary doctor is posted at the gate and at the plant who does the ante-mortem and the post-mortem of the buffalo. In each plant, there are CCTV cameras installed all over as per the instruction of the state government. In most of the countries which are importing meat, some of them post their own veterinary doctors in the plants to ensure that the quality is safe and that it is buffalo meat. In addition, everything is monitored on the website and each animal when it goes for slaughter, it is accounted for and the meat from that animal is also accounted for."
Moreover, the approximately Rs. 27,000 crore buffalo meat export trade is not the monopoly of a single religion; the recent discovery that a particularly acid-tongued BJP MLA had part ownership of a meat export firm for three years only underlines the fallacy of making such divisive insinuations. In light of this, for Mr Modi's assertion to hold true - that India, is in effect illicitly exporting a buffalo-cow mix - would involve a sinister, decades-long collusion between central and state governments, meat traders, exporters and perhaps even consumers in the 65 countries to whom India exports meat (of which the three biggest are Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand). It was a breathtakingly provocative claim for a politician of his stature; if he had proof to back it up, it is yet to be shared with the Indian public.
But with one stroke, he was handing to the dangerous ecosystem of self-styled gau-rakshaks their 'aha!' moment. Damn the evidence, they could now say (and they do) - no less than the Prime Ministerial candidate is airing the very conspiracy theories they deployed to justify their vigilantism.
It can be no one's case that violence over cow slaughter is a new phenomenon; if anything, it occupies one of the oldest chapters in our communal history. Which is why the freedom for states to pass cow protection laws was given a Constitutional mandate under the Directive Principles. As a result, over the past five decades, all but 11 states have banned cow slaughter outright. The cow slaughter debate, at least in theory, ought to have been settled, but for individuals and groups - some of whom owe direct allegiance to the Hindu right, others whose links are more ambiguous - who have kept alive the myth of 'cow in peril' through a volatile mix of half-truths and rumour.
 
This attack-first-proof-be-damned modus operandi is evident in the killing in Dadri and in similar assaults. There is today a partial curfew in many parts of Kashmir over the killing of a man after a mob in Udhampur firebombed a truck he was driving. The grounds: that he and the others in the truck had illegally killed two cows. The police found that the cows had died of food poisoning. The truck was transporting coal. In Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh, the "discovery"of the skinning of an already dead cow led to a near-riot and the near-lynching of four men. Police suspect that the son of the man who gave the dead cow to the men for skinning had tipped off the mob.
We were witness firsthand to prevarications of these groups when, ten days after Dadri, we filmed with the Gau Raksha Dal, a self-described cattle protection group based in Haryana, but with units across North India. They had called us to a temple compound in East Delhi, where, flanked by local members of the BJP, they claimed to have rescued two trucks of cows bound for slaughter to Uttar Pradesh (where cow slaughter is banned). When we asked how the simple stoppage of a truck automatically establishes the cattle inside were being transported for slaughter, a BJP person present changed tack, saying it was a violation of animal cruelty laws, which stipulate that cattle need to be transported under certain guidelines. Even if this was the case, it has less incendiary potential than claiming cow slaughter, not to mention milder punishment under the law.
Also, the "rescued" cows in this case were not cows at all, but bullocks. (This turns out to be true for almost all their videos, and a good amount of the propaganda material we were shown by similar groups in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra). The bull, in popular imagination, does not carry the same emotive charge as gau mata. In fact some states which ban cow slaughter - like Maharashtra, until recently - permit the slaughter of  bulls after they have been certified as infirm.
How did the Dal explain this anomaly? They did not. Standing next to a herd of emaciated bulls, they threatened the worst possible fate for anyone caught harming the gau mata.
But it can be said with confidence that the images from Delhi would have already passed into the self-sustaining loop of context-less, time-less, date-less images (or increasingly, WhatsApp videos) of cattle "rescues" or even gory carcasses that we have been shown by similar outfits as far apart as Maharashtra, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. In almost every case, there is very little indication of where or when these were shot, what was the specific illegality, whether a case was registered, and if so, what was the outcome. Instead, each image, each video or anecdote validates the other, creating the perception of large-scale illegal cow slaughter.
The power of rumour allows the cow vigilantes to bypass what is a more likely scenario: an illicit cattle trade far smaller in scale than their hysteria will have us believe.
Even such as it exists, it has less to do with an Islamic conspiracy and more with the compulsions of the cattle economy, where farmers sell livestock that they have no use for to meat traders. For the most part, these take place inside government-run cattle markets, where scope for illegality is slim. But there are bound to be outliers, of cattle changing hands outside the purview of local laws. The solution to this is not harsher cattle protection laws and increased vigilantism - which only increases the possibility of illegal transactions - but to address the question of potential remuneration to the farmer.
 
In Maharashtra, farmers' groups that protested alongside meat traders after the state government extended the ban to infirm bulls posed the question most directly: "If the Hinduvatva-waadis are so fond of the gau, why don't they come to the market and buy it from us?" Several cow protection groups we have posed this question to had no answer. For good reason. Foregrounding the role of the farmer and of cattle economics deflates the selective, communalised narrative of gau-rakshaks, raising questions about their true motive: is it to protect cows, or to use exaggerated myths of the cow in crisis to stoke sectarian tension, even political gain?
That this vigilantism is allowed to operate with impunity is a disgrace to the law and order machinery of all governments, regardless of political colour. The Gau Raksha Dal, for instance, has operated for years in what was until recently Congress-run Haryana.
But the blind eye policy came with an unspoken rider - that the alarmist and rumour-powered grammar of cow paranoia will not leak into the higher tiers of political establishment, even by those who may privately sympathise with its proponents. In the case of the RSS Parivar, it has been until now largely left to the domain of the VHP, the Bajrang Dal, or within the BJP  to the Adityanaths and Sakshi Maharajs.
That is why the current political regime stands answerable today - starting with the Prime Minister himself, for breaking this unspoken Lakshman Rekha with his pink revolution remarks.
Even if he could be forgiven the poetic license of the campaign trail, where are the prosaic clarifications once in power?  
The mob may understandably want nothing to do with inconvenient statistics, but that fig leaf cannot extend indefinitely upwards. The last animal census conducted between 2007-2012 finds that the Indian cow population grew 6.5%. Overall, though, its growth rate is 1.5% less than that of the female buffalo.
 
This, according to KML Pathak, an animal scientist at the Indian Council for Agricultural Research, is due to simple economics: buffaloes have higher, richer milk yield. "Milk prices are fixed on the fat percentage. The fat percentage in buffalo milk is more than cow's milk," said Pathak. "That's why there's an increase in the buffalo over cattle population."
 
The only drop of any significance has been in the population of the bull, which has no dairy benefits, and has fallen by 19 %. According to Pathak, the main reason for this is the increased preference for mechanised farming.
Instead of the toning down of cow rhetoric, we have the Chief Ministers of two states where the BJP registered a significant electoral victory, again on the back of a mandate seemingly for progressive governance, making much of passing anti-beef laws. On cue, both drew praise from BJP President Amit Shah, who in his speech to the party National Executive in April this year, praised Maharashtra and Haryana for proving that only the BJP has the interests of the cow on its mind.
This is, of course, another clever evasion. Cow slaughter was already banned in both states for years. Haryana merely made the laws tougher, while Maharashtra extended the ban to bull slaughter. It's hard to gauge what these announcements achieved on practical terms, other than keeping alive cow-alarmism.
Even after Dadri, and the first round of supposed disapproval expressed at the highest level, the BJP/NDA's cow-pitch remained high: the otherwise moderately inclined Sushil Modi began to speak of a cow slaughter ban in Bihar (which, again, already has such laws). A minister in the Haryana government is running an opinion poll to replace the tiger with the cow as national animal. His boss, the Chief Minister, made a statement (which he later claimed was a misrepresentation) saying Muslims can continue to live in India, but they will have to give up eating beef.
Why then is the BJP surprised that its centre of power will be held to account when murders are taking place on manufactured rumours of cow slaughter? Even if not the administrative Centre that the Prime Minister sought to absolve of responsibility, what about the party's political Centre which lit the spark in 2014 and has since kept the flame on slow burn? Is it surprising, furthermore, that the supposed chastisements of party hotheads will continue to be viewed with skepticism, given the closed-door, source-based manner in which they were conveyed?
 
Since the killing of Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri village, the District Magistrate of Gautam Buddh Nagar, under whom Dadri falls, has been going from village to village speaking of the gradual leak of poisonous propaganda into the veins of impressionable young men. The BJP's top brass needs to decide whether it is sincere about turning off the tap, or letting the slow drip continue.

                            Along with the article by Swaminathan Aiyer, this is the best article I have read on this issue so far. Mr Modi - thanks to the quality of our journalism - you can run but you cannot hide! It lays bare BJPs' politics of hatred practiced by fekuji and his ilk. As the development agenda falters, they will increasingly use such divisive issues to try and polarize opinion to create a Hindu nationalist vote bank, but at what cost to the country? How many mothers will loose their sons because of this? Congress was not just better, but a LOT better.

                            a thought provoking live commentary to all political and involved parties<br/><br/>
as a neutral person who has never tasted cow meat. what I undestand is that the whole save cow,kill men was a manufactured propaganda on lies and only lies by few cranks<br/><br/>
cow slaughter ban in our country dates back to the mughal era if not before and economically slaughtering cows is not viable then or now<br/><br/>
but petty heads just innovated beef slaughter and mixed with cow slaughter confused people and tried reaping communal and political advantage<br/><br/>
wat was lost at last was few lives of innocent cows,bulls and yes humans and opened up a Pandora of cranky hate speech which showed up real faces<br/><br/>
if this hatred of communalism  and intolerance doesn't vanish.there will.be more cows and less humans soon..All men lunatics may be  not termed as humans

                            Let Cows, roam around endlessly in hot weather on streets, eating polythene bags and dying a slow agonising death or maybe getting killed by an oncoming vehicle. All this happens right after the 'gau-mata' stops giving milk. Now thats ok!<br/>
But if the animal is killed, rather than making it suffer for years, then all hell breaks loose. Why because it has become an issue on which some people and organisations can latch on to and gain political mileage. <br/>
'Intolerance' is first, a political issue and then a social one. And sadly we have a govt which has won most of its elections based on this issue. BJP under Vajpayee was a right wing party, BJP under Modi has completely gone bonkers!

Another interesting statstic that has not been commented on - buffloes have increased inspite of large numbers being slaughtered.Now what do you say for that ?

Few weeks ago, I was surprised and saddened to see such a lukewarm response to the Dadri lynching incident. There are people who laugh at and make fun of secularism. They see the culture of tolerance as the weakness. These people are more powerful than and ever.

                            The way things have unfolded in the last 4-6 weeks and the entire media operating with a singular mindset, it definitely smells of a well planned strategy to rake &amp; create issues to target the govt., even if a Central govt. is sneezing then it is being made as a breaking news. Something seriously wrong somewhere, things are not so simple as they appear to be. Time is not far when the so called pseudo secular parties and highly partisan media will make an issue if a BJP guy happens to fart in public. And God forbid if it happens in a non-Hindu area, locality or even near to a place of worship, it will be considered as an act of polarisation!!!!

But can you be equally non sentimental about Muslim feelings?<br/>
I doubt you sick one sided pseudo!<br/><br/>
Cow is a symbolic gesture of God to some Hindu. I won't ask u to say the same about pork in any country they will play victim card and might as well raise a fatwa to kill u.<br/><br/>
Anyways Hindu majority is uniting by you sick words. It will haunt you and Muslim orthodox.<br/><br/>
I hope it should never happen otherwise you are going to be in deep trouble.

                            When a Riot happened in a state around 13 years back , everybody blamed the chief minister,then prime minister washed his hands in the name of "RAJ-DHARMA" and no media blamed the Prime Minister of that time...This guy handled the issues alone (We can disagree the way he handled)...later no such incidents reported...I believe , that is what a ruler should do ..<br/><br/>
Now the funniest thing is , All media want  response from the Prime Minister for  problems in the states.Why is so ?<br/><br/>
I could see multiple things here, One Visual Media is worried about there existence, because , No Big announcements Or Breaking (Relevant) news are coming in the TV, everything is coming in Social Media directly,So they are desperate. The current PM is promoting Social Media in a Big way..so they will have no big News...

                            Stray cows have become one of the great menaces on Indian road. In fact, these are not stray cows, but they are owned by people. These cows not only cause huge traffic problems in city roads and busy junctions, but also litter the roads with dung and thus contributing to making our roads dirtier. Why don't the self-appointed "gau-rakshaks" spend their energy and time to take care of these stray cows and show their true sense of love for the cow?

                            It is stupid to expect Mr. Modi to react every time such things happen. In his inimitable way he had given his reaction when he said ' I feel sad like as if my car had driven over a puppy dog'.There is nothing more for him or anyone else to say on this matter.

Things are blown out of proportion, some thing drastic is cooking somewhere?? &amp; most painful is media  instead of writing facts,is distorting &amp; twisting it for someone's advantage!!! It is a big conspiracy,congress have always done it,they were always afraid of someone else getting the popularity,Gandhi/Nehru were afraid of Bhagat singh's popularity,then Subhas Bose,disappeared in mysterious  circumstances,now they are scared of Narender Modi,but why Media is siding by them?????, I mean any tom,dick &amp; harry,can understand why it is happening now, Why no question to UP,government?? I think,this time again Parliament will.not be allowed to work,in order to block key reforms,look at the timing,now winter session is approaching,that could be the plan,if that happens,congress will succeed in halting the parliament &amp; media plenty of coverage, to sell their channel to make more money!!!!

                            Dear Srinivasan jain,<br/>
Agreed and with you that what happened in Dadri or J&amp;K is incorrect and the guilty should be punished severely. But having said that let us understand India. In our country, one set of people,consider Cow holy, one set of people consider Pig unholy, one set of people ban even excellent books like Davinci code or plays like God of Agnes.<br/>
This is how India has been for past 65yrs+. Is this new to us ?? Actually what used to happen, the Muslims, Christians and other have always been allowed to express their protest /ban/ fatwa and have always been heard and acknowledged. Where else for a strange reason in India, Hindus (again we are referring to small section of people, who get impacted &amp; are sensitive to cow slaughter or indecent depiction of Hindu gods)when they protest, they are given a deaf ear, called names like right wing/ Hindu extremist and so on. By the way rest of hindus (majority of us) are insensitive &amp; care less on any matters in the country. This small section (of hindus) have never been heard (like their counterparts in Muslim / Christians), which has made them uneasy and they are reacting in this manner. The need of the hour is to also give them a hearing, probably we can save all this commotion and unwanted tension in the cities.

                            We sometimes eat beef, but not at home.  <br/>
But strictly do not prefer COW.  which might lead to several diseases. <br/>
To get a high milk yield the cows in our country are fed and injected with steroids and hormones which the west administers to both cow and bull to get faster growth.<br/><br/>
We rear cows at home and let them die naturally.  The utility of the cow diminishes with old age, the meat is hard, and being with the family for so long becomes a pet, which no one will want to kill and eat. <br/><br/>
Muslim, Christians, Sikhs or Hindus the utility and values are the same for all and cow is a revered animal in all households.

                            Brilliant article. As noted by another reader, the attacks in response are so predictable that they are laughable. And don't forget the repetitive use of terms such as "presstitutes" and "sickular". Such ignorance and insecurity. It's fascinating to see how the narrative is slowly changing. At least in this age, one is held accountable for what one says to different audiences! The contradictions are become glaring! Looking forward to seeing what the line of attack on this comment will be- sickular? Or congress Chamcha?  Come on guys!

                            Due to cow slaughter, not a single village has become cow-less village in India. Every village has got huge cow and no sign of creation of zero-cow village anywhere. On the contrary, due to female foeticide in INDIA, numbers of villages are created without any girl-child. In Gujarat, Patel community is suffering from the problem of bride shortage. So, respected Hindu gentry should think of banning female foeticide more seriously than banning cow-slaughter. Otherwise, devil is waiting in hell for female-less communities,,

                            Shreenivasan Jain, you deserve special recognition by the media fraternity for this brilliant piece. Jaitley's comment'such events bring India a bad name' sums it up. The BJP that will sell fizz at any cost, merely finds Dadri killing to be inconvenient. The twin-forked tongue with which everyday you hear from Mohan Bhangvat one story and the same day Shah or Modi saying the opposite... good cop, bad cop! Modi is restrained when in his seat in Delhi. But his penchant for vitriol is at its best when he is campaigning! He has never stopped, since 2013. The sheer hypocrisy of the Sangh parivar is sickening. If the cows had a voice, they themselves would ask for a slaughter, rather than chewing newspaper and plastic on Indian roads. What a way the Parivar wishes to see their' Gau Mata !

                            Well researched and nicely written article Mr. Srinivasan Jain, one only hopes that this does not turn the ire of the vigilantes with the 'Active Support' of their bosses, on you. One can only hope that better sense prevails amongst the common man (if at all there is one), whose only interest is to improve the quality of their life and that of their children.

                            The real issue is far from what we are getting to see.. The fact is the current Govt. Knows that they can never fulfill their promises and do not want people to question about their promises during elections and hence polarizing issues such as beef ban to divert the attention. It's a planned move from political parties. BJP or Congress it takes a lot of time to get a country with 1.2 billion to change its development cycle. One politician cannot do it in 5 years. We should not be blind and fight for such reasons unless we are part of a political party. I can give up eating beef if 5 of my friends does not like it because for friends and society I live is more important than what I eat. Understand the hidden agenda. Just remember the ads you saw during election campaign and see how many promises are even close to be fulfilled you will get your answers.

                            The most cogent Op Ed demolishing the myth of "PM is above it all" . The other tragic thing is that the Police, at least at the lower levels, who are supposed to protect the common man from the thugs are often seen taking the side of the thugs and harassing the common man. The last statement - BJP needs to decide if it should turn off the tap of the communal poison - is a complete wishful thinking. BJP has already chosen the path of keeping communal cauldron boiling way back in 1990s and it has only varied in degrees and not in the general direction of that approach. It is for the country to decide where to draw the Lakshman Rekha for the BJP even as it may find BJP better in terms of Corruption levels in the Government.

                            when cow slaughter is banned in states, why some leaders wants to host beef party to create unrest among other communities? what is the truth behind dadri incident and why none of you write about the truth?<br/>

                            If you agree that cow slaughter is illegal, and different state governments are not implementing it inspite of people protesting, things can go out of hand which is what we see. Pink revolution or not we are 2nd biggest exporter of beef(both buffalo and cow), don't quote official references which are half-truths. thousands are cows transported around Hyderabad every month if you want to investigate Truth(no Hype, no half Truths).<br/>
Statements by political elements are for political gains. Every party is doing that and will continue irrespective of you are I not like. What is important is that how are responsible govts are implementing laws. SP govt miserably failed in law and order time and again. Also Maharastra, Karnataka govts failed to protect prominent personalities. They hide behind secularism to avoid answering. This Secularism has become a mask of scoundrels lately.

                            What is practical difficulty to protect cow is not known to public through media. Media agency must visit some towns and villages and observe following:- 1. When farmers or cow owners fail to get milk, they do not keep in their shed and let the cattle wonder. 2. Town and Grampanchyats has sheds provision. Who will feed in the shed? Fodder and grass goes to somewhere else. 3. These wondering cattle on street and eating paper any dam things are smuggled out. Is there any govt. policy to solve these problems by BJP on national level. Hindus are only mentioning 'GO RUKSHAK". All Hindus never keep cows. Only inspires people. This is the fact. Even Lalu eat away grass and crores of rupees.

                            In a country with Majority Hindus, we do not pay any heed to the feelings of the majority people. Take the case of Saudi Arabia and all Middle East Muslim countries, it is TABOO to mention  the word  PORK. Muslims follow that meticulously. Can they not reciprocate the same towards their brethren in INDIA?

                            Excellent analysis by Sreenivasan Jain. Yet another factor that seems to have escaped under the radar is the burgeoning leather industry, worth about USD 12 billions in 2014 of which USD 6.5 billions is received as export incomes. Indeed, the Make in India webpage has a separate page devoted to the leather sector, cf: makeinindia.com/sector/leather/. India produces 10% of global leather requirements; the sector is labour intensive and employs rural youth and women. The Council for Leather Exports (leatherindia.org) states: "The leather industry is an employment intensive sector, providing job to about 2.5 million people, mostly from the weaker sections of the society. Women employment is predominant in leather products sector with about 30% share". How the existence of the leather industry squares with the government's cow slaughter policy is for me a puzzle. Now, does the BJP really want to squander the opportunities for export revenue and employment generation ?

                            These are strong arguments to suggest that alarmism on the issue of cow protection is a manufactured phenomenon. I would like to see some more in depth journalistic investigation on issues as they play out over the next few months to be convinced though.

                            Shame on NDTV for creating a propaganda by falsely propping up the "likes" for the so called liberal views from the back-end (most computer literate folks will understand this).  It just doesn't add up!!  <br/><br/>
Will NDTV be open for an independent review of their system - not their data but just their systems - reviewing logs etc that can track whether these "likes" are coming from discretely and distinctly independent sources ?

                            On the eve of the of the Independence, Jawaharlal Motilal Nehru and his guidance counselor Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi conducted an impromptu survey of Hindus (Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel was opposed to the idea but was out voted by 2 to 1... at last, the brahmin-bania cabal had removed the last obstacle to unfettered rule), who were highly literate at astonishing 99.99%, as to the type of nation they wanted for themselves and their posterity... <br/><br/>
First, they had agreed with the dynamic duo that such a highly educated society was a menace to itself; second, it was agreed that Punditji should rule the nation until he was no more and thereafter, his progeny would inherit the mantel; third, Mahatma was authorized to excoriate Hindus if they derided Muslims for refusing to migrate to Pakistan which had been just created to accommodate their demand; fourth, they had agreed that needs of minorities had precedence over their own needs because Gandhiji had read it somewhere during his stay in South Africa; fifth, it was unanimously agreed that it was not the nation of Hindus as the world had come to know it but a federation of disparate races, ethnicities, religions and creeds, thus the majority had no priorities over the rest...
