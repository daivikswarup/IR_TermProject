Headline::::PM Modi, Can You Bring Back This Investment



DateTime::::2015-04-22T04:09:00+05:30




                                Prime Minister Modi's retinue on his frequent foreign trip often includes top businessmen representing India's powerful and rich. Are they the best ambassadors for our country?
 
18,000 steel workers in the UK don't think so. In 2007, Tatas took over the company which employed them, Corus Steel, in a 12 billion dollar acquisition. Tatas have 'achieved' in just seven years what no employer in the steel industry in the UK has done in the last thirty years - to force its workers and employees to go in for a strike ballot. From May 6 to May 29, these 18,000 workers will vote on whether or not to go on indefinite strike against the employer's intransigent attitude regarding their rights. The legal notice of the strike ballot is to be served on the company on April 29.
 
The immediate issue is that of the pension scheme. In the UK, the pension scheme for the steel industry, the British Steel Pension Scheme, applies to all workers who retire at the age of 60. The workers each pay around 8 per cent of their salary, and the employers 12 per cent, as a deferred wage towards the pension scheme. Tatas now want the workers to keep working till the age of 65. If they opt to retire at 60, they have to accept a 25 per cent cut in pension entitlements. The unions have calculated that this would, on average, mean a whopping 100,000 pound loss per worker. Negotiations between the employers and the unions have failed and Tatas have now reportedly threatened to scrap the pension scheme altogether.
 
India's corporates believe in the "dil maange more" mantra, never an end to their demands to help maximize profits at the cost of the rights and entitlements of workers. The Prime Minister's 'Make In India' slogan accommodates this philosophy, One of the selling points that the Prime Minister has showcased in world capitals while asking foreign investors to come to India is the carrot of labour reform.
 
Labour reform is nothing more than a euphemism for the elimination of the rights that the working classes have won through years of struggles and sacrifices. The right to a basic minimum wage, the right to bonus, the right to pensions, the right to security of employment are all under attack. The first attempt to take away these rights was made by the UPA Government through amendments to various labour laws. They failed to do so. Now, the Modi Government, using its sledgehammer single majority in the Lok Sabha, has pushed some of them through. State Governments led by the BJP like Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat, and by the Congress party in Himachal Pradesh, are eliminating legal rights through extremely retrograde amendments which remove over 70 per cent of India's workers from the framework of legal protection against arbitrary dismissals, cuts in wages and other benefits.
Already, labour cost to total production cost is at its historic low in India. In 2011-2012, the central Labour Bureau in a special publication revealed that labour cost was just 5.25 per cent of total production costs. Labour reforms will target even this rapidly shrinking share.
 
The changing patterns of labour deployment and the increasing resort to outsourcing, contractualisation of work in place of permanent employment, and the establishment of the hiring and firing of workers as the sole right of the employer without any intervention of protective labour legislation is what employers all over the world demand. The Prime Minister's 'Make in India' slogan promises them all this and much more.
 
Indian corporates who invest abroad carry these anti-labour practices with them, seeking to impose them on workers abroad. The understanding is that contempt for workers' rights is shared by neo-liberal advocates of the governments in the UK and most of Europe - the whole world is the stage for corporate offensives. The steel workers of the UK have challenged this thinking. Workers in India and indeed across the world wish their struggle success. Each struggle strengthens the other, regardless of its location.
 
And one last word. The slogan of 'Make in India' would have more credibility if the Made in India business houses invested in India rather than abroad. According to an Assocham study released in November 2014, between April and September 2014, which includes the months when Mr Modi took over as Prime Minister, Indian companies invested 17.6 billion dollars abroad. In the 2013-2014 fiscal, it was over 36 billion dollars.
Bring this investment back to India, Prime Minister. And if you can't, at least publicly reprimand corporates who bring a bad name to India by the kind of attitudes being displayed by Tata Steel against the ongoing struggle of steel workers in the UK.(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Yes, Brinda would rather have 'Make in China' compared to 'Make in India'. India is facing stiff competition in manufacturing from neighbors that have resorted to currency manipulation and other things. In the UK and US, manufacturing has gone down the drain after employee unions have made labor costs outrageously high and accountability at historic lows. Its nearly impossible to fire inefficient semi-skilled labor due to union memberships. Stop vilifying people who invest money. They are not here for social service. Communism runs as long as there is some rich mans money to skim and give to the poor. What after the last rich man is dead?

                            This article is full of half truths and white lies. Ms Karat should first explain what her government did to West bengal's economy. Why despite 30 years of left rule West Bengal is one of the poorest states in economic and human development index. Before blaming Modi government for flight of investment abroad, why does Ms Karat not ask UPA government about their indecisive policies on investment. TATA group bought Corus, a loss making company. I order to turn it around and make it productive, Ms Karat may not appreciate the word, TATA wanted employees to work longer. They did not fire anyone. An inefficient workforce, used to high salary and good life now wants to go on strike. Good for UK economy.  Before shedding crocodile tears on labour force in the UK, which by the way are much better placed and pampered, what did Ms Karat and her party do for labor force in West Bengal and during 10 year of UPA rule? Oh I forgot, Ms Karat's party simply drove industry out of Bengal in the hope labor problem will also go away.

                            Mrs. Brinda how about some facts:<br/><br/>
1. The default retirement age in UK is 65 years. <br/>
2. The state pension age in UK is between 61 and 68, depending when someone was born and if they're male or female. (for females it is 65 years)<br/>
3. TATA's policy is actually inline with UK's state policy.<br/><br/>
Now coming to claims about India:<br/><br/>
1. "The legal protection against dismissals in India" sounds good only on paper. It takes about 1-2 years to fire a permanent worker in India, even for incompetence or gross impropriety. No wonder India has missed the industrialization bus, as most of the industries have preferred places like China, Indonesia and now even Vietnam. Even the moral and financial aspects for our labor laws are flaky, because what this law has done is forced companies to primarily hire contract workers, which get low wages and almost no protection. So, why do you want to continue with policies that are good for no one?<br/><br/>
2. Indian companies invested 17.6 billion dollars abroad last year. You want the money back but also want to "reprimand" the companies. How about you read your own statement once more. If I am reprimanded at home, why would I not run away? Unfortunately, the left has been doing the same for 50 years, while China, their role model state has moved on from the disastrous philosophy to industrialization and prosperity.<br/><br/>
Sorry, I don't buy your argument.

Let me ask you a simple question. Can you you keep maid even you don't want it or can't afford any more?<br/><br/>
If your answer is yes since the maid us working for longtime, then I agree with you.<br/><br/>
If your answer is no, because you need to  conserve money, then you are hypocrites.

                            "the right to security of employment" is only possible if the company is doing well. Brinda would like all companies to behave like PSUs, where the worker is guaranteed a job even if the output is zilch. This is the reason the commie regimes around the world collapsed. Even china had to undergo severe economic restructuring while maintaining political hegemony. When will our commies learn???..."Never" is the answer.

                            I have a lot of knowledge about the pension schemes in UK; not only have I been a member of one for many decades but I was also a trustee of a scheme.  Brinda's knowledge of such matters is nil but she will as is her wont, use any method to attack private enterprise.  So let me first analyse her various pronouncements on the British Steel (Corus) Pension Scheme.  That scheme started many decades ago, long before Tata came on the scene.  Further, the scheme and Tata are separate legal entities.  The scheme is a Trust and administered by Trustees, such Trustees including worker representatives and pensioners.  A worker acquires, over many years a value in the scheme, depending on his and the employer's contributions.  When the worker retires, the value acquired generates an income which the worker receives as a pension.  In India, most companies make the cash value available to the worker in the form of a superannuation lump sum and it will be up to the worker to make a living from this fund.  Whereas most UK schemes were solvent until the 1990s, when Labour won elections in 1997, Gordon Brown then the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer (equivalent to the Finance Minister, Jaitley in India) raided the Pension Funds.  Prior to Brown coming on the scene, Pension funds were able to receive dividends on their investments tax free, but Brown changed matters such that dividends were received net of tax.  All the calculations that were made by actuaries were therefore rendered redundant and following revised calculations, most pension schemes in the UK were classified as insolvent.  Many employers made good the shortfalls but others simply did not have the cash reserves so to do and neither were they profitable enough to do so.  Most major employers used to have what is known as the final salary scheme whereby employees were paid a pension of say two thirds of their final salary.  These employers included banks such as HSBC and Barclays.  There are no final salary schemes (also known as defined benefit schemes) left in Private Enterprise in the UK today.  There are only defined contribution schemes.  In these, whatever has been accumulated by way of employer and employee contributions is used to generate an income and pay a pension.  With people in the UK living decades longer than when the pension schemes commenced, added to the fact that interest rates have been at the lowest rates in over 300 years, most pension schemes cannot meet their obligations but that is not Tata's fault.  They made the contributions they were required to. The facts that Brinda conveniently ignores is that Tata is looking after workers who retired in say 1990, long before Tata came on the scene, by way of making good the shortfall in the pension scheme.  Indian readers should know that the British Government recently privatised the Post Office.  The pension scheme of this State owned enterprise was hopelessly insolvent.  It was the Government that made good the shortfall.  British Steel was also, for many decades a State owned enterprise.  Why does Brinda expect Tata to make good the shortfall of a scheme that for most of its existence they have nothing to do with?  Why different treatment for the Post Office and Tata?  Even state pensions are not given until the age of 65 so why should Corus employees be paid at 60?  Women were entitled to a state pension at 60.  Even that has gone up to 65.  So why is Corus any different?  All major employers, including HSBC and Barclays have a normal retirement of 65 so why should Corus stick to 60?  I could go on and on but it would be beyond Brinda's understanding.  As an Indian, I was very proud to hear Britain's Prime Minister praise Tata as being the largest manufacturer in the UK.  Brinda is obviously ashamed that Tata exists at all; Private Enterprise is, to her, abhorrent.  As an Indian, I was very proud to learn that Tata looked after all victims of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, not just Tata employees.  As an Indian I feel ashamed that my motherland has the likes of Brinda who will seek to do harm to our institutions while leading a life of luxury herself.

                            I hope people will read my comment in detail. As Continental and UK economies falter, the cozy system of retiring at 60 is no longer affordable for anyone, including the ever intransigent French worker. We saw these protests about 67 year retirement in France too but now they have realized they have to do that. If the workers do not relent, the whole company goes for a toss. Who loses? Workers who are in their 20s and 30s, not those who are sitting comfortably looking at 60 about two years from now. Has Ms. Karat thought about those workers? The future? <br/><br/>
Now, coming to Ms. Karat's assertions about worker rights. She is still stuck in the era of Manchester power looms and Pinkerton scabs. Things had changed much over the last 70-200 years. Workers in the west just did not get rights, they have come to enjoy luxurious lives. At one point, a cleaner in automotive factory with 30 years of service was taking home much more than a highly qualified engineer who had no job security and no union to back her up. If segments of Capital intensive industries in the west are suffering today, it is because of escalating labour costs which are beyond reason- 35 hours of work etc. All that is fine if workers were productive. But in many cases they are not. <br/><br/>
What about job security? If dismissing a recalcitrant worker is arbitrary, then no organization can survive and that is what we have seen with our government over the last 70 years. Even those charged with corruption get fully paid under suspension as cases drag through courts for years without any conclusion. Wage cuts? Yes, if company is not doing well... Do you think any sane business person wants to lose good workers through arbitrary lay offs and cuts? Are all business people Sadists that are in business only to extract their pound of flesh? <br/>
If the west wants to have affordable consumption, it needs to outsource then unless they temper their lifestyles. If India wants to develop economically and socially, it needs to change its expectations. Workers should have their rights but they have obligations too. If they have the right to pension, the right to strike, then they have the right to be productive. Did Ms. Karat ever take a look at the productivity of certain industries in India? <br/><br/>
The west saw loss of jobs but creation of opportunities for those who reskilled themselves. In India, we never see the likes of Ms. Karat fighting for reskilling, skill-development, advanced education classes/ training programs for workers. They only insist on increased wages and more benefits. Any organization that only pays but does not earn becomes a liability on society as a whole, and this common sense escapes the likes of Ms. Karat.<br/><br/>
Instead of recycling the tripe that should be in a dustbin somewhere, Ms. Karat is better off calling on employers to make skill development, family welfare, workers' kids education part of their benefits. <br/><br/>
So, all in all, no right thinking person ever will stand by and watch workers losing rights or exploited. But the CPI's cardinal is that it only harps on rights, uses that as a political tool to rally unsuspecting workers. It neither thinks nor does it allow the workers to think for themselves about their future, their families' future, advancement in life. After all, just like Rahul Gandhi needs the poor to remain poor, CPI needs workers to stay where they are. A progressive worker is a loss to the party. Even workers seem to realize that.

Apparently not content with the rights and welfare of Indian workers - this insufferable commie has decided to vomit commie diatribe about the welfare of some British workers (as if after 200 years of forced servitude and colonization and pillaging by their forefathers of this country - we Indians ought to pretend pity or empathy with them!) . In her commie paradise of "work farms" and "Gulags" that is Kerala and till quite recently Bengal - Karat can live out her Animal Farm-esque perverse parody of Commie bliss - just spare the rest of us who aren't enamored with the welfare hell and decrepit failure that typifies your Commie utopia.

                            Maybe you should consider what would have happened to all these steel companies had Tata or another investor not taken them over. They would probably have shut down completely and all jobs would have been lost. Steel is going through a downturn in prices and all steel companies are stressed. UK is a very high cost manufacturing location and most other manufacturing industries have shut down there anyway. I think it is to Tata's credit that they are continuing manufacturing there. Instead of acknowledging these realities, the author seems to be living in her own Marxist heaven where noble workers are being exploited by capitalists etc etc....

                            I am sure the Make in India applies to Indian investors outside, who have done so because of the poor investment climate here. Karat is just making noise in this write up. If they support the government in its ventures, then there is no reason why things should not work out. As Prem said in his comment, stop vilifying the people who have and invest money. <br/>
Ms Karat should also be informing us how she manages to buy all those cotton sarees (far expensive than the synthetic ones) and how she manages to travel around the country for her talks.

                            Better Brinda concern herself with the pathetic state of the CPM in India rather than of British workers who need no help from her ilk. This is the consummate stupidity of the Indian Left. They concern themselves with issues which are not their concern. Tata is a shrewd businessman who knows what he is doing. And why should Modi bring back this investment whose success or failure has nothing to do with him? I know the CPM likes to talk in lofty jargon about everybody else's so called mistakes. Better they take steps to ensure that they do not become extinct in India. Only a matter of time.

                            Compared to the elite capitalists are making money for their nth generations while labour don't get commensurate wages.

But communists idea of cutting a tall tree to bring it on par with a sapling is no solution. help the sapling grow.

                            Agree with what you have said.  The labours in India are the least protected in an organisational hierarchy.  They struggle to get basic healthcare and most of  them are not provided any insurance by their employers.  Having said that, labour unions are equally to be blamed.  The principles on which they function are wrong.  They expect to be paid whether they work or not.  Even legitimate action taken by employers against employees are resisted with violence, strikes, etc.  One just has to look at west bengal to know the damage labour unions have caused.

                            Brinda Karat is completely ignorant. The life expectancy in the western world has gone up. It was perfectly OK for some one to retire when the life expectancy was eighty. But now a days the average life  expectancy in western world is 85 to 90. So one would expect that the pensions have to be adjusted correspondingly. So the British Steel workers should work upto 65 yers to get their full pensions. Nothing wrong. In USA, social security benefits kick in at the age of 66 for those born before 1955 and at 67 (completed) for those born after 1955. Tatas are doing the right thing. They need to provide the share holders an income.

                            Dear Ms. Karat, <br/><br/>
Why don't you put yourself in Tata's shoes and think why they have to take this step. Its because the so called workers demands and pensions are not economically sustainable. Either they close the plant and walk off leaving those 18000 workers without a job or they agree to this cut. <br/><br/>
Its because of your illogical and impractical ideology that states like Kerala and West Bengal continue to languish without industry.<br/><br/>
Nobody owes anybody a living. If I invest my hard earned money to start a company, (If everybody were to simply put money into bank without investing and not expecting a higher return, then there would be no banks since there would simply be no borrowing for investment, only for consumption.) Do I get any safety net? If the company goes belly up, my investments are at risk, the workers still get paid their monthly salary and perks. You talk about workers right... what about entrepreneurs rights? what about investors rights? What happens when I close my company, who will pay me my pension? what is the incentive to start a company? - Oh yes, the pleasure of paying my workers their livelihood till perpetuity. <br/><br/>
You mentioned about labor costs falling... which age do you live in? We have automation and now its no longer about worker's skill which influences the product value but rather the R&amp;D, ability to be agile and cater to customer as fast as possible which makes a difference - the Hindustan motors factory may have the most skilled men able to make a car which nobody wants since they are stuck up in the 60s... but a company like Suzuki or Nissan have highly automated factories where worker skill have a very minimal effect on production outcomes as compared to Hindustan Motors. <br/><br/>
Which company do you think will be sustainable on a long run? What you are doing is dis incentivizing a workers need to grow and develop his skills and learn new things, why because your ideology says a person whose job has become redundant should still be made to do the same job at much higher cost even if the industry does not require it. <br/><br/>
Its time you changed your ideology. I know there are companies which do not pay a legal wage and exploit their workers, but surely not all companies esp employ

                            How can we get the investment back when acquiring land itself is a major issue for setting up a plant. Ms Karat put in place stringent norms for land acquisition if is acquired for a specified intent and with a specified time frame the project should be launched and the benefits as enunciated by the buyer should be delivered if not punish the buyer. For instance it is being attempted to use for purpose other than that it was bought for put the buyer behind bar and impose a huge fine and  or return the land to the original owner. Labour reforms are needed Madame, I am sure you will agree our labour is one of he least productive when compared to most countries across the Globe. I am not saying labour should not be protected I feel every citizen needs to be cared for after they have crossed the age of 58/60 with adequate pension and health care. Now how do we go ahead and attract investment if we have regressive land act and labour law come out with a solution that convince the entrepreneur to fearlessly bet his time, energy and money in setting up a venture. Madame if you look at all the major good business houses and successful entrepreneurs even before CSR came into place have been giving back to society from their huge profits by investing education, sports academies, rain water harvesting and taking up rural development projects etc. so stop damming business. You have American Business man and his spouse investing in India's health sector pouring in millions of dollars. So all I am telling is that the left of centre and the so called pro poor are harming the poor when they do not assist in creating a conducive environment for businesses. Some businesses are bad they will get destroyed by social movement and the people at large. The fundamental of modern day business is business are their to serve the people and the one who serves the people best will in the long run be the most profitable and successful business and they in turn will bring prosperity to society. We are in the 21 century were everything is people driven.

The uk labour market is much much more costlier and enjoy immense perks. The very reason why manufacturing is almost non existent in uk is due to the high cost of labour and these unions. You guys do realise how high the pension must be. Just the loss of 100000 pounds loss per person the report states is equal to a crore indian rupees.

                            Labour rights will have to be degraded for a while if India is to emulate the "high growth" trajectory of China. The reason is simple. We don't have any bargaining power. There are other countries that are offering a competetitive cheaper labour-market than India is currently. This means we have to go out of our way to attract investment. This is a reality that even the "communist" party in China realized. The labour laws in China do not allow laborers much collective-bargaining rights. They also don't have the right to strike, as an when they please. These restrictions or lack-of-freedoms are all part of the sacrifices that our country will also have to make, if it has to keep its gowth rate going. The alternative is to "keep the rights but lose the jobs". For now, India has to think in terms of jobs and less in terms of rights.

                            There are two kinds of people. 1. First handers - who build something, take risks, work hard, have passion to build industry, product, services etc. 2. Second handers - who get work b'coz first handers has created something, build something, their risks have paid out. Second handers exist b'coz of first handers. Have you ever heard of any communist who set up an industry, thought of new ideas and created products and given employement? <br/>
Who creates jobs? What will happen if first handers stop doing anything - taking risk, growing their work. Does communist party be able to provide job to even a single person. <br/>
When Tata's acquired JLR - they took huge risk as JLR was not doing well. If they have not acquired it, you don't even know if JLR would have existed today. If they are driven by money alone - they could have invested this money elsewhere. It is in genes of the first handers to take such risks. That is how the civilization has progressed.

Please refer to the basics of economics which also places emphasis on productivity, efficiency and minimization of cost to be competitive. Socialism has ruined the generation of entrepreneurs in this country. It made people beg with govt, and made some of the wisdom struck professors to establish research institutes in Delhi to run research on how to keep India poor since it benefits class like you. It is first time after 60 years we have an opportunity to thread new path.  So what it has some demerits and may not always perfect.  We are in the bottom of the barrel and hence any different thought must be supported. It is time we bring hire and fire less protection of inefficient so that industry can thrive and create more jobs all the way. It is time to access that free market conditions brings best in all - be it employer or employees

Tatas were praised in UK for being a good employer and awarded by UK Government. On top of that strikes are not new to steel Industry. Why does she not talk about labour relations in Jamsehhdpur?

                            Madam Brinda,Also in the same vein tell that in Russia people are going without even regular wages not to talk of pension, and in other countries like China people are made to work for 18 hrs. etc. so that Modi can keep a safe distance from the Heads of these countries and refrain from shaking hands with Tata, Putin,Xi etc.She has already passed her judgment condemning Tata and all industrialists of this country.Why is she whipping up antagonism against desi industrialists and pouring vitriolic abuse.They are the people who invest thousands of crores and provide jobs to youth and carry the risks.They are also integral part of this nation and please for heaven's (or Marx's!) sake stop this they vs aam admi.Do not follow divide and rule for vote catching.

                            This will not help to open the eyes of Modiji. He will go on making feku promises to the illiterate and ignorant Indians. When he cannot get even One Rupee for the Indian poor, as against his promise to credit 15 to 20 lakhs to the bank accounts of every (poor) Indian, he is promoting flight of money abroad by big corporates in the guise of investments abroad, which goes on unabated, as against the feku drum-beating about "make in India". Then the same money will be brought in by the same corporates as foreign donations for helping the BJP election campaigns. A great vicious circle !!!

                            What Bindra does not know that even the employees in Pulic services like National Health Services , Local Councils have been denied a pension at age 60 and have changed the pensionable age to 65 years People re healthier and living longer and the previous pensions at 60 are no longer affordable. I wonder when will people like Bindra wake up to realities and be a bit more practical The State of west Bengal is an example of such social experiments. Someone has to pay for all the welfare schemes and it is certainly not Bindra from her pocket

                            Trade Unionism has destroyed the jobs for millions created by "industrialization" as the capital is moving into "de-industrialization" ruining all chances for another Communist Manifesto. There will be no need for the likes of this pen-pushing communist, as robotics takes over the shop floor cent percent.

                            @Prem: Did you read this "labour cost was just 5.25 per cent of total production costs". Day is not too far when the continuously squeezed and persecuted labor will form a force. Then the corporates have to eat money, sleep money. <br/>
Cheapest labor is from Philippines and Bangladesh, are we going to beat them and offer lowest in cheap labor.

                            I live in the UK and the line 'Tatas now want the workers to keep working till the age of 65. If they opt to retire at 60, they have to accept a 25 per cent cut in pension entitlements.' is a total lie! Its the government that has pushed up the age of retirement and how much pension on can draw on retirement. <br/><br/>
As with the Land acquisition Bill, opposition leaders continue to peddle lies on all fronts!

                            This government claims as "government of poor". They should not ignore the social security benefits of the employees. All recent industries are highly modernised. This requires less employment. Labour is one of factors of production or services. The poor and rich is dependent on each other. History of rich find a poor in the bottom. It is their legitimate claim of being properly reimbursed of their work. Thanks Brinda-jee to remind this government of its duties towards all the stake holders of the industry or development.

                            Brinda has deliberately skipped comments on state of steel industry in Europe including UK. Tata are following UK rules and why should she worry about UK which has set rules for decades. These are passing phases in business and Tata would recover their money. This money never went out of India as it is provided by British and International banks . Why worry in India ?

                            Your party ruled West Bengal for three decades. Strikes and red flags made sure that all industry shifted out to other states. This includes the Bengali who could not find work in West Bengal.
