Headline::::PM Modi, Is There a Method to This Madness



DateTime::::2015-03-27T18:33:00+05:30



Harsh V. Pant is Professor of International Relations at King's College London. His most recent book is "India's Afghan Muddle" (HarperCollins).The Modi government's Pakistan policy is facing a serious crisis - a crisis of credibility. In an absence of a clear strategy, there have been several U-turns that have befuddled this government's supporters and critics alike. Consistency is overrated in diplomacy. A nation's foreign policy should be nimble enough to be able to respond effectively to ever dynamic domestic and international contexts. But the Modi government's Pakistan policy has taken so many turns in the last 10 months that it is in danger of becoming a joke.
It had all started on a high note. After coming to office, the Modi government rightly gave the Indian military much-needed operational space to carve out a response against Pakistani provocations along the Line of Control which was swift, sharp and effective. Together, the Indian government and the nation's military managed to underline the costs of Pakistan's dangerous escalatory tactics with targeted attacks on Pakistani Ranger posts along the border. The government then went on to cancel bilateral talks in August last year after Pakistani High Commissioner Abdul Basit met Kashmiri separatist leaders. The message that seemed to be emanating from Delhi was that it retains the initiative on any move towards normalisation of ties with Pakistan.
But just a few months down the line, the Modi government has not only resumed bilateral dialogue even as Pakistani violations of the ceasefire have been steadily mounting, it has even conveyed to Pakistani authorities that the Pakistani High Commissioner is free to host separatist leaders except when officials talks are on. Where this leaves the government's earlier moves remains a moot point. This confusion is manifest even in the government's own pronouncements. When Mr Modi greeted Mr Sharif on Pakistan's Republic Day, he tweeted: "I have written to Pakistan PM Mr. Nawaz Sharif, conveying my greetings on the National Day of Pakistan," adding further, "It is my firm conviction that all outstanding issues can be resolved through bilateral dialogue in an atmosphere free from terror & violence." Â 
India was also forced to reacted to the Pakistani Embassy inviting Indian separatist leaders to their Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi with the Ministry of External Affairs underlining that "the Government of India prefers to speak for itself. There should be no scope for misunderstanding or misinterpretation on India's position on role of 'so-called' Hurriyat [separatist]... there are only two parties and there is no place for a third party in resolution of India-Pakistan issues."
It is difficult to take these pronouncements seriously when the Modi government seems to be doing everything possible to undermine its own position on these key issues. It is clear that Pakistan is getting emboldened because of developments in India and the larger region.
Though the United States has decided to keep the 9,800 troops currently in Afghanistan on the ground through the end of the year, rather than reducing the number to 5,500 as planned, it does not change the Obama administration's withdrawal date of December 2016 for all US forces. Without American forces in Afghanistan, there is a strong possibility that Afghanistan could host a reinvigorated Taliban allied to a reinvigorated al Qaeda, not to mention ISIS, which is gaining a foothold in the region. And Pakistan has emerged as central to the outreach to the Taliban by Washington and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.
In Jammu and Kashmir, the new PDP-BJP coalition government has sent mixed signals about their seriousness in tackling extremists in the state. The PDP has been so solicitous of Pakistan that it has even credited Islamabad with making elections in the state a success. And now with the Modi government's erratic policy on talks, Pakistan's intransigence vis-a-vis India seems to be paying off.
Given New Delhi's reluctance to continue to impose costs on Pakistan, is it any surprise that Rawalpindi believes it can get away with anything? There is an entire industry in India that for decades has been chanting the mantra of engagement with Pakistan. The crucial issue is not engagement or disengagement - it is engagement on whose terms and towards what end! The choice that India has is not between talking and sulking. Pakistan has continued to manage the facade of talks even as its support for separatism and extremism in India continues unabated. India should also continue to talk (there is nothing to lose in having some level of diplomatic engagement after all) even as it needs to unleash other arrows in its quiver to manage Pakistan.
Pakistan's longstanding policy of bleeding India by a thousand cuts continues unabated because it remains convinced about India's inability and unwillingness to impose serious costs. Unless the Modi government makes a clean break from the past, it will also make India hostage to perpetual turmoil much like its predecessors.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Modi keeps Pakistan guessing on what he will do next. The initiative is with Modi. His message is clear - Pakistan is NOT a priority, and we will do as per our mood that day.<br/><br/>
The strategy has indeed brought results. Civilian deaths are at an all-time low, Pakistan gets repaid in kind when there is border-firing, there is a representative govt in Kashmir, India is focused on economic activity and relations with important countries. Plus there is no drama like aman-ki-asha, etc.

                            I fully agree with the idea of credibility loss if same modus operandi continues even or a year.

                            A country can never frame a permanent or static policy when it has a hostile neighbour like Pakistan.There is nothing wrong in responding fiercely when there is an unprovoked firing from across the border.At the same time and alongside this efforts for official level dialogue also continue in order to create a cordial atmosphere between two countries. A "carrot and stick" policy has to be adopted depending upon response of the other party.

                            Realization must have dawned by now that India is no Gujarat and there are no quick-fixes when it comes to international affairs-leave alone economic woes in an intertwined world- particularly your neighbours. Needs and demands of administration are a different kettle of fish vis-a-vis election rhetoric

                            The short answer is NO, there is no method behind this madness. It is just sheer, unadultrated stupidity and directionlessness.

                            What would you have Modi do? Go to war?? He is handling Pakistan correctly. Engaging them, while sending two messages. One, we want to talk, and want peace and trade, but not at any cost. Two, Pakistan is not something that will take up a lot of my time... I have a lot of other things I am focused on. So if you are serious, let's talk. Otherwise, please don't waste my time.

                            Harsh Ji, there has been some up-downs, but we must wait, there is subtle change, BJP is part of the J&amp;K state gov, BJP is at the center as-well, the local dispensation of kashmir has to be given some fodder, hardliners have to be squared, thou you have mentioned abt border firing increasing, but its not the case or else the media would have ripped &amp; rouged  off the Indian attendance at Pakistan National Day Celebration, Congress would have called the president to banish the Modi Gov. Yes there has been a spurt of terror attacks in Jammu, but there has also been a drastic rise in squaring up of the terrorists,  Still i do feel that pakistan has to be dealt with a severe hand, a hold no bars attitude.

                            A good Article. I truly believe that Indian media is more or less like Indian politicians that gets its thrill by sensational news rather than raising substantial issues.<br/><br/>
Let me be very clear, ISIS threat is very real. Europe and USA are concerned with them even though there hasn't been any militancy there. And here is India that has been targeted by militants for decades now in the name of jihad. The day ISIS turns its head towards India it will create a havoc. I have no doubts in India's security forces but don't forget organizations like ISIS, much like other jihadis, don't rage a direct war on nations. They specialize in turning normal looking people into terrorist and that is the threat. <br/><br/>
What is going on with India's policy on Kashmir has been very sad and it's not this Govt but previous Govts as well. You will be fooling yourself if you believe that this is some kind of strategy from India to keep Pakistan guessing. After all, after decades of refusing to accept a third party (read separatists) India was on a diplomatic stage with Pakistan and separatists. What makes this more crucial is the statement by Pakistan high commission right before the event reiterating once again that they see separatists as an integral party to a resolution on Kashmir. Does this not give credibility to Pakistan claim on separatists? WE are all quick to say our ex PM MM Singh is an honest man but he was in a bad company there by making his guilty by association, So wouldn't the  world see India sharing stage at a diplomatic event with separatists as India finally acknowledging that separatists are a party on kashmir?

                            Well said. We are dithering rather than sending a serious message that tells them to behave. Seriously, why be so power hungry and ally with the Mufti, who is shamelessly pro-Pakistan? The only thing left is to bend over.

                            Good advice for Modi to show a plan, and there is no problem in changing the rules of engagement as you learn. But I wouldn't worry too much about "talks with Pakistan". The Army calls the shots (no pun intended) and Modi can sit with Nawaz only. What's the point? Pakistan will continue to be a problem until the US realizes its IMF and other financial and military aid is counterproductive to American interests. And that will begin when US troops leave.

                            I tend to disagree with the author -<br/>
- India has made costs unaffordable of adventure by Pakistan Army<br/>
- If you have not noticed success in trapping spies as well as tightening noose on funding activities<br/>
- getting support from other countries not to let their territory to be used against India<br/><br/>
Modi has been consistent to the extent his statements from pre-election and today are same. Not even that BJP-PDP is bold step and a big risk only courageous person can take.<br/><br/>
I think India has made cost of knives which bleed India itself unaffordable to Pakistan.

                            There actually seems to be a lot more hidden aspects to this than what is apparent. Looks like the media too is being fed with only that we as Indian public ought to see. If Indian Foreign Policy after being really aggressive earlier in its stands, have become really defensive off late; by conventional thinking it means we have been caught off guard with something! What it actually is; is like the MH370. We may never know the real story!

                            The problem with India's Pakistan Policy is that India keeps getting nudged by US to talk to Pakistan. This has been happening in NDA-1, UPA-1, UPA-2 and now with Modi Government. While US role has helped for ceasefire, etc,, it gives a long rope to Pakistan. We were hoping Modi will pursue an US-independent foreign policy with Pakistan, but it was not to be.

                            A fundamental principle keep engaging without expecting results and keep upgrading defense against threat. Result you become a good country to deal with. When Pakistan continues on its path of harming India they will get exposed and they will also get destroyed. The only worry is for the whole world is what happens to the nuclear weapons built by a failing state. So India has to help and support the people of Pakistan who want to coexist with India in lasting peace. For this India will have to go the extra mile helping all its neighbour to be part of of India's Growth story and also help them to achieve economic development and fostering democratic values. This could become a game changer in Pakistan mending its ways.
