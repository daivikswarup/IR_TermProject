Headline::::It is 'PK' Protestors Who Are Mocking Hinduism



DateTime::::2014-12-30T01:36:00+05:30



(Siddharth Varadarajan is a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Public Affairs and Critical Theory, Shiv Nadar University)Remember that scene from Jaaney Bhi Do Yaaron? You know the one: where Naseeruddin Shah and Ravi Baswani are being chased by the evil Tarneja and end up in the middle of a Mahabharata performance? What followed were surely some of the most hilarious moments of Hindi cinema, and the laughs were all at the expense of some of the most revered personalities from the Hindu epic.If such a film were to be made today, some self-styled 'sena' or 'parivar', acting in the name of all Hindus, would have accused the actors of denigrating Hinduism and demanded a ban.The law is clear that such "hyper-sensitive" individuals cannot be the arbiters of what is permissible in a society like ours but it is time to take the debate over the Hindi film PK to the next level: What are we, as individuals, and as a society, prepared to do to uphold our right to go to the cinema with our friends and families to see the movie of our choice?The Aamir Khan-starring movie has been cleared for public exhibition by the Central Board for Film Certification and has been very popular with audiences, grossing over Rs. 200 crore in its first week. But a section of the Sangh Parivar - that group of moral policemen who want to control what Indians watch, wear, sing, read, and eat, as well as whom they can love and where they can live - wants the film banned and has resorted to violence in several cities across BJP-ruled states like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.Though the majority of Indians who have seen and enjoyed the film are probably Hindu and there are no reports of ordinary moviegoers saying their religion was slighted in any way, those demanding a ban insist PK mocks Hinduism.Prominent among the protestors is the Hindu Mahasabha. This is an extremist group whose founder, V.D. Savarkar, is part of the RSS pantheon of heroes and whose most infamous member, Nathuram Godse, assassinated Mahatma Gandhi in 1948.While it is easy to laugh at the irony of organisations that are themselves undermining the sanctity of the Hindu faith now accusing others of blasphemy, the violence they have resorted to poses a challenge to the governments of Narendra Modi, Devendra Fadnavis, Anandiben Patel and Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Will they allow mob violence, or the threat of more attacks on cinema halls, to undermine the rule of law and the right of citizens to watch a movie they wish to? Or will they act firmly against the violent elements, even if they share an ideological affinity with some of them?In the past, state governments from north to south have tended to turn a blind eye towards moral policemen, leaving cinema hall owners, art galleries, concert venues, bookshops and publishers to fend for themselves in the face of physical intimidation and violence. More often than not, movies, books, plays and exhibitions that politically influential mobs do not like end up being banned informally because of the failure of the police and state administration to provide protection to those in need of it.The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that maintaining law and order during the screening of a film is the responsibility of the government and the threat of violence by politically-motivated mobs must not be allowed to violate the rights of the public at large. When the demand was made that PK be banned, the Supreme Court refused to entertain the matter. 'Don't see the film' was the sage advice the bench gave the petitioners.Given the steady increase in the number of cases where mobs have used violence or the threat of violence to enforce their diktat, it is not enough for us to merely insist the government rebuff the demands for a ban on PK. That the Supreme Court has already said. What we must demand is that the police do their job, providing protection to cinema halls showing the movie, and acting pre-emptively against those organisations and their leaders that are inciting violence over the issue.Whether it is the violent protests over PK or the aggressive 'ghar vapsi' programmes, the reason saffron extremists have behaved so outrageously in BJP-ruled areas is because they know they have the support of influential sections of the Sangh Parivar. But the Chief Ministers of these states took an oath to uphold the Constitution of India, and not the constitution of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh or some other sectarian organization. They have a duty that they must discharge without fear or favour, something they have been reluctant to do so far. Anyone is free to call for a ban and protest peacefully. But if they take the law into their own hands and endanger the security and rights of others, they can and must be arrested, prosecuted and put away.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Seems India elected BJP for better India but it appears BJP surrendered India to these BABA'S who will eventually take India back to stone ages then Modi's Gujrat development model will be effective.

                            To be fair PK did touch upon the 'wrong number' schemes of mullahs and padres. I seriously think if it had be any of them protesting over the cinematic content, we would be reading an article on insensitivity of the censor board under an 'ultra-right wing' regime.

                            Did the movie "Oh My God" had the dialogue "JOH DAR GAYA WOH MANDIR GAYA"? Why can't PK used the lines "JOH DAR GAYA WOH Masjid/Church/gurudwara GAYA" Please don't try to project a secular face. I know we are all secular but Hindus are also human being who have some feelings and sentiments and you should respect them.

                            When vishvaroopam was screened, few Muslim organization protested for few scenes to remove, entire media, politicians including BJP leaders &amp; celebrities supported Kamal Hassan and opposed the protesters. Everybody said it was freedom of speech. And now why those leaders &amp; celebrities not openly supporting Aamir Khan, It is his freedom of expression. Com'on guyz...! If Kamal Hasan portrays Muslims in badlight that's ok with you guyz &amp; If Rajkumar Hirani express his views about cunning selfstyled godmen then it's insult? #GROW UP.

                            I am an Aamir fan but this movie was an unwise decision. Aamir should have outright rejected the role explicitly quoting that he will have nothing to do by taking a controversial topic on religion and focus more on one religion selectively. That would have earned him respect. Again the cast for such topics should be well thought out, if instead of a Khan it was a Kapoor or a Roshan doing it, there probably would not have been such a hue and cry.

                            Mr Siddarth Varadarajan,  The problem with the movie is it criticizes mostly hindus while leaving other religion practices which hurts every hindu.  Say for example in the movie, if aamir says all people who pray allah are weak minded, do you think that religion would have kept quiet and watched the movie like the hindus doing it now.  Also aamir critizes wasting of milk on the hindu gods, can't he criticize the wasting of candles or chadders at Churches and Masjids. If the movie want to criticize the gods, let him criticize all the gods and not only the hindus.  If you watch the movie closely it clearly shows how he criticizes only hindu gods which also includes aamir distributing only hindu gods as missing.  Does he mean that Allah or Jesus are existing?  Though it looks comedy entertainment, one should not ignore the partiality the directory and makers of this movie showing to criticizing only one religion and on which india stands.

                            Mr Varadarajan, Your qualifications look impressive, putting in a state where you can probably be presumptuous enough to pass judgement on what the people of the country do or don't do.However, like all of us mere mortals, you are also a mere mortal and possessed of all the prejudices and biases that ordinary mortals possess. So ...please refrain from playing God.<br/>
First of all, it is common knowledge that you are a Modi baiter. You do not like him and hated every moment when the Lok Sabha results were being read out. Narendra Modi won with a thumping majority and you were acutely unhappy. That frustration is evident in your article here. tat the beginning f the article you say that apart from a few misguided gringe groups, everyone liked the movie. You also said that these are the moral police unleashed by BJP govts., that dictate our lives. At the end you say, they can protest, but peacefully. You are talking in two languages.<br/>
Second, please do not compare Jaane bhi do Yaron and PK. The comparison is utter, simplistic nonsense. JBDY was a spoof on a particular scene - not a cmommentary on the practices of a religion.Also for your information Varadarajan, Hindus do have a sense of humour. But PK, denigrated the Hindu forms of worship. It was brazen in its attempt to mock our faith, what we believe sacred and our institutions - read temples. And you find this acceptable? It is 'sick'ulars like you who are dangerous. The Censor Board can make mistakes. A lot of the educated elite also find PK offensive. We are not politically correct and fashionably neutral. This is the first film, which I find, rocks the very foundations of the Hindu faith. Though their methods could do with some sophistication, VHP, Bajrang Dal and other organisations have every right to protest this movie/

                            It is amazing so many people are writing about this topic. Everybody wants to beat their chest and show how secular they are and how a few handful people represent Hinduism. I am convinced that majority of us Hindus do not appreciate the behaviour of such people. What I am asking you is to recognize it and please extend the same courtesy and criticism for others. Don't hide under the veil!!

                            This movie not only says the fake Gurus as wrong numbers, which is ok, given the number of such instances are seeing, mocking at the hindu way of worshipping idols is going a bit too far. By having the protagonist as alien, the director too this a bit too far, making fun of Hindu gods, for example, how can Shivji be afraid, a small idol yields small returns and a big one can yield bigger. However, much the scenes are disguised, the director makes it a point to mock at the beliefs and Sentiments of Hindu. Film directors should chose other ways of putting their point not directly attacking certain age old beliefs and sentiments.  They could not have stretched their imagination this far, with other religious beliefs like Christianity or Islam, though film has a brief guarder cameos against these, for obvious reasons as these religions have a strong support from outside India and can go to anylengths to ensure their interests are protected. Unfortunately Hindus are so divisive and self-contracdictory with no strong organization or tenets to ensure their interests are protected.<br/>
Overall the film touches a raw nerve and fortunately for the average hindu movie goer, who just seeks entertainment, did not realize he purchased entertainment at the cost of making mockery of his own beliefs and sentiments.

You are in no way representing a Hindu whose sentiments have been hurt by the movie.Those who have been hurt too have the right to express their anger,just like the way you are allowed to write any rubbish on anything under the sun.

                            Mr Varadarajan. Had there been protests when Mahabharata characters were made fun of this day would not have come. In the name of creative freedom film makers make fun of a particular religious belief and you expect people to watch it without protesting. When someone makes fun of your family members, do <br/>
you protest or go watch it and clap in theater?

                            Well Said ! But if the movie was mocking a MUslim community or religion would it have been taken in the same sense, and would a Muslim writer / Journalist have supported if there was an outcry? Hindus seem to have taken Secularism all on their own, the other communities only use secularism to their convenience. This whole thing  is stemming from Hindus being tolerant all these days, a Muslim outcry is expected and hence no such acts (in the movies) or otherwise are dared. And Yes the RSS / Other are capitalising on the current sentiments in the country and politicising the issue. Who is to blame? Hindus for being sportive? or the Muslims for being Aggressive? or the Politicians who want to capitalise on every given opportunity.

                            Though I too enjoyed watching the movie and have no issue mocking the so-called God-men misleading public but on hindsight I found a subtle discrimination in the movie throughout. It is surprising the director / hero did not have a single issue with Islam and its moulvis, clerics when the world is going through worst human rights voilations across middle-east and asia due to Jihadi terrorists. Is it because they do not want to antagonise the Muslims? or wary of similar fate of Vishwaroopam of Kamal Hasan?

                            I would have appreciated both, the movie makers and the ppl praising the movie if the ills of all the religions were highlighted. Do u guys mean to say that Hinduism is the only religion having these issues? Then where were u guys (ppl supporting such progressive movies) when scenes from movies hurting muslim or christian sentiments are cut? Is freedom of expression not compromised during such times?<br/>
And those ppl talking about the poor, do u think about them (poor) when u r spending on urselfs while partying or merry making or even when shopping and dining out. At those times its ur hard earned money rt? And u have the right to spend it the way u want? Similarly ppl hav the rt to spend their hard earned money making their offering in which ever way they want.

                            The media is so secular that it does not bother when Hindus are converted with foreign funds and when Muslims vandalise movies or books which have some obscure mention of islam and they bash hindus and hindu organisations when an open abuse of the religion is made for making money.  Even if the producer is Hindu, he does not become eligible to abuse his own religion.

                            When you mock a belief, know that every other belief is equally laughable.Because a belief by very definition, is not a fact. If a belief is proven it would become a fact. Therefore,all beliefs by other name are imaginations or hypothesis or superstitions or religions. All these words are essentially the same with slightly varying degree of 'ridiculousness'. For example, Earth is  roughly round is a fact, Earth was created 6000 years ago is a belief,Earth stands on an animal's horn is another belief,Universe was created by someone sitting above in 7 days is also a belief,all these belief are equally laughable until proven, none of them is a fact.Therefore, either you mock every belief or keep your loud mouth shut, because selective mocking only shows your hidden agenda, prejudice, little mind and Saudi funding.

                            Just like the right wing 'hindu' extremists, Mr. Vardarajan belongs to the extreme right wing critiques, who have taken the onus of finding the wrong in the majority. Never saw him take on the minority extremists in this fashion. <br/><br/>
At the same time violence from any group is unacceptable, it shall be more appropriate to file a case and protest in a more civilised way.

                            I could not understand why NDTV is giving so much importance to fringe elements...hardly 10 protestors everywhere and all the crew and editors are writing articles on this...in fact they are mocking hindu religion as usual....

                            Also know,that the three possible hypothesis or beliefs or superstition or religious theory, whatever you may call it- There is one God, There are many Gods, There is no God, are equal when it comes to their probability being true or false.They all have same probability of 33% for being true.So any idiot who says that his/her belief is superior does not know the basic law of probability.Until it is proven,someone claiming there is only one God with so and so name, someone claiming there are 33 million Gods and someone claiming there is no God have equal probability of being proven an idiot.

Moderate Hindus will not stay quite against such extremism.

                            Well hindus have brought this on themselves.This movie is just outright discriminative against hindus and hinduism.Why not show or talk about what goes in islam/christanity? I guess author and director and Amir Khan don't have guts enough to do that.<br/><br/>
This movie needs to be banned or have scenes hurting hindu sentiments removed.Also , this writer is talking about RSS,saffron extremists but perhaps you forgot what ISIS or extreme islamist terrorist groups are doing all over the world.Message given in this film isn't wrong but the way in which it is given is wrong and discriminative and a big laugh in the face of hindus.

                            Messaging of the movie was spot on. I liked the movie for that. But there was absolutely no need to mock 'Shiva' look alike in the movie. I am sure bollywood directors will not dare shooting that scene in toilet on 'god look alike' from other religions. <br/><br/>
I respect all religions &amp; gods and do not like making fun of any.<br/><br/>
Again, I did like the way these so called God's men were exposed, but no fun of GOD please.

                            Amir Khan shud understand that he  could make such a movie only in Hindustan, any other place he would be behind bars for Blasphemy.<br/>
Why not show good things of Yoga by Baba Ramdev or Art of living by Ravishankar. No point in overgenaralizing things, if he wants point some specific things he can choose specific subjects and not over generalize.

It is time Pseudo secularists like Mr Varadarajan stop liking those who mock Hinduism brazenly, in the garb of supporting secularism &amp; free expression. If I make same comments with Lord Shiva/ Vishnu being replaced with Prophet Muhammad or Pope, then these same pseudo secularists will cry hoarse that I am being anti secular and hurting religious sentiments. The height of hypocrisy.

                            The protests to movies and vandalizing theaters has to stop, however controversial the movies, or for that matter paintings and books as well. <br/><br/>
People should review the criteria of the Censor board and challenge that in the court, so that the bar is set by the people and Censor board acts according to that.  That way ridiculing of religions, communities would stop, based on established &amp; published criteria and Censor board is made just an acting body.    <br/><br/>
As for books and paintings, PIL should be launched forcing the central government to establish a body that approves books and paintings as well, based on published criteria they would follow.   I mean if the painter or book author wants to showcase his work in public domain, it should be approved by a body which publishes the criteria transparently.

                            Religion is a matter of faith and faith generally IS blind (as we erroneously overemphasise faith as "blind faith") and as such not subject to any scrutiny of whatever kind. If one religion (Hindus as mainly portrayed in the movie PK) is censured it is bound to be instigating for its followers and for the opportunists to religiously or politically exploit the situation. Every religion has its own rituals, traits and nuances - so why touch where it hurts. A simple comedy can be a cause of distort and disharmony for the society. There have been such instances in the past (Satanic Verses, caricatural representation of religious symbols, religiously offending paintings, etc.) so why ask for more trouble. Let things be as they are - in harmony!

                            I think focus should be on censor board.....Quality of members missing causing many problems. In the past few years, we can see movies with 10 to 20% dress for (Wo)men(some can argue it's fashion or their choice) !!

                            Don't lecture us on constitution, legalities in India. Indian pillars of democracy has no impartiality. Democratic pillars are totally rotten. People like u give big lectures. We know the consistency of  court verdicts which will be different for similar cases and much of the interpretations have been different. Example: Recent cases related to Delhi Rape Case were courts have become emotional and prejudiced because of public out pour.

Something happens in non BJP states its Modis fault, state government are responsible only if they are run by BJP. I think you leftist just want to beat the modi dispensation up with whatever you can. This is what you have been doing for last 13 years and you will always find something to comlpain about Modi no matter conversions, no conversions, economic boom bust ..etc...

                            The treasury is empty. So naturally the government can't deliver its wide spectrum of promises. So its cadres are doing things which don't need money. Swatch Bharat; no spendings. Conversions; no spendings. Now protesting PK; no spendings. This shall continue for five years. <br/>
Promises like, Cleaning Ganga; lakhs of crores involved, no specific time frame. The list is big....<br/>
So when one is opposition, one can roar.

                            I saw the film yesterday  and so no real issues. It does not attack Hinduism at all.  yes some scenes felt uncomfortable  but   were fair comment - we do have pakhandis  who will  take   advantange of god fearing  people of India.   I think  it actally provokes  some thinking into our relationship with God  .<br/><br/>
 I  like Ramdev and  his Yoga message and I think India has the government that it needs at this moment in time. We should not fall into this  trap of trying to defend the indefensible. There cannot be any   excuse for violence and intimidation and those responsible should be  brought to justice including  payment for damages.
