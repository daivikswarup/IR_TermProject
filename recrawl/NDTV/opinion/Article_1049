Headline::::Rohith's Mother Has These Questions For Smriti Irani



DateTime::::2016-02-25T12:07:00+05:30




                                Rohith Vemula's mother, Radhika, was at a candlelight vigil at India Gate demanding justice for the 26-year-old at the same time that Smriti Irani was giving her response to the Lok Sabha debate on the young student's  death.
Radhika Vemula was picked up and taken to a police station in the heart of the capital when Smriti Irani was telling parliament how condemnable it was that a "child was being used as a political tool".
Watching Smriti Irani's performance, I recalled a grieving mother's words, the words of Radhika: "I want to meet Smriti Irani and ask her 'On what basis did you declare my son to be anti-national? Your Ministry had written that my Rohith and other Dalit students were anti-national extremists. You said that he is not a Dalit. You accused him of getting a false certificate. Should I say it is because you got false certificates for your educational qualifications that you think others do so too? You stopped my son's stipend, you got him suspended from the university. You are the Minister for HRD, but you have no value for education. You can never understand how difficult it is for a Dalit to reach the stage of doing his PhD. You can never imagine the hardship, the struggle, the tears and sacrifice to reach that position. In three months, you destroyed what it had taken me 26 years to build. I am talking about my Rohith, he died at the age of 26.'"
"I want to tell her these words. I want to ask Modi ji, 'For five days you remained silent. You went to Ambedkar University and when students protested you said 'Bharat Mata has lost a son'. If you believe what you say, then why have you not taken action against those who called that son anti-national. Who is right? Is the Minister right? If so, then why did the Prime Minister call an anti-national India's son? Who will give me these answers?'"
The day after thousands of students and people from all sections of society joined the March for Justice for Rohith in the capital, I went to meet Rohith's mother Radhika. I had seen her throughout the march. Held supportively by her younger son Raja, she walked stoically, silently, brushing away the tears, a mother in mourning and yet a seeker, a fighter for justice.
Behind the dreadful institutional murder of Rohith Vemula that has led to anger and outrage is another story - the story of hardship, the story of a daily resilience, the story of hope and courage, a story that is played out in a million Dalit homes every day, that of the Dalit woman, the Dalit mother. Radhika Vemula, now 45, is a symbol of that story that India is yet to recognize, leave alone respect.
Radhika was born to Dalit migrant workers. As fate would have it, her parents' search for work took them to Guntur town. Next to the neem tree under which the migrant family, including two-year-old Radhika, had camped, was a house in mourning. Anjani Devi had just lost her baby daughter. In her sorrow, she found solace in the presence of the migrant workers' daughter, Radhika, playing in the shadow of the neem tree. When it was time for the migrant workers to move on, Anjani and her husband persuaded the family to leave Radhika in their care.
Radhika was told later that her biological father used to drink and her mother was very sick. These were the circumstances in which Radhika's biological parents gave her up in adoption to the family who had lost their child. In the narration of her story, Radhika's words mirror the experience of those lakhs of Dalit families, landless, torn away from their roots, at the mercy of landlords, of contractors, forced to move from place to place, and, for families like Radhika's, from the shadow of one neem tree to the next.
She learnt the truth of her adoption in the most cruel way, when a senior member of her foster family started abusing and cursing her in the name of the caste she was born into. Her foster parents, who belonged to a backward caste, believed that it was in the child's interests to keep her caste concealed. So she grew up thinking that to be a Dalit was a crime, a dark secret which she should never speak about. She was burdened by this guilt.
She wanted to study, but by then her foster parents had their own children and things started changing. She was married off when she was just 14 years old and after she completed Class 10 to a drunkard.
Once again, the reality of her birth as a Dalit returned to haunt her. Her husband found out about her caste and the violence she faced increased manifold. She tolerated this for five years and then decided she would take her three children, Neelima, Rohith and her youngest, a two-month-old baby, Raja, back to her adopted family.
She was not welcome. Her male siblings did not approve, influenced by patriarchal notions that a woman's place should be with her husband. Radhika made up for it by substituting the domestic workers employed by the family with her own work, hoping it would help. She felt that if she saved her siblings the money they paid for domestic work, they would give her shelter.
The three children experienced this too. She tried to protect them. Raja says, "We sensed what was going on but my mother never complained, she never burdened us with her pain. Even later, when we had shifted to a home of our own, she gave us her best. She never ate with us and when we asked, she always said that she had already eaten. The truth is that she stayed hungry because there was never enough food."
Yet today, Radhika has the highest regard for her foster parents. She understood their dilemmas and  never held it against them that they could not prevent the abuse she faced later on.
It was through these struggles, these experiences, that Radhika discovered herself, discovered her pride in her Dalit identity. She shifted out with her children, and rented a small room. The choice of the place was deliberate - she shifted to a Dalit colony. She had nothing to hide anymore. She worked hard in a tailoring shop and with the help of her foster mother, sent her children to school and college. The days were hard. Sometimes she ate one meal a day. But she was at peace with herself.
She is angered that after all this, she is being accused of manufacturing a Dalit identity.
She is deeply affected by the charges made by Smriti Irani and echoed by Sushma Swaraj. The police and officers at the bidding of the HRD Ministry have been sending out teams to disprove her Dalit identity. Two weeks ago, the entire family was called to the government district office in Guntur and their statements, including of her foster mother and regarding Radhika's childhood, were recorded. On February 12, three officers went back to Anjani Devi's home and questioned her for five hours.That night, Anjani Devi had a heart attack. She was rushed to hospital, but died two days ago. By then, Radhika was on her way to Delhi.
Radhika says "She, a highly qualified teacher, M.A., M.Ed, adopted me in the grief of losing her own child. She was innocent of the poison of the caste system and what it would mean adopting a child from a Dalit family. Both of us paid the price."
In Radhika's eyes, Rohith's admission to Hyderabad University on his own merit validated her life struggle. He was her confidante, her hope. He helped out the family with his stipend in times of their acute distress. She speaks of how he paid back the Rs. 28,000 she had borrowed to pay for his admission. She recalls the time he bought the first mattress any member of the family had ever slept on after she had called him weeping that his recently operated-on sister, Neelima, could not sleep on the hard floor. She listens with a smile as Raja recounts that the first time they had ever heard of fast food was when Rohith gave him a surprise gift of noodles after he got his degree.
Raja, just a year and five months younger than Rohith, is deeply affected, traumatized. He, unlike his older siblings who had been sent to a private school where their Dalit identity was not known, had gone to a government school where he faced discrimination early on. He wanted to give up his studies after he completed his intermediate exams but it was Rohith who persuaded him to continue, promising him a better future. It was not to be.
The mother shifted to Hyderabad at the end of December last year to be with her sons. Her last meeting with Rohith was in their small newly-rented room in Hyderabad. He promised to visit every weekend. His  words to Raja at their last meeting on December 29 were that he would ensure that Raja could do his PhD in a foreign university. She was not told of what he was facing. Her sons wanted to protect her. She was totally unprepared for the events that followed.
The mother believes that the university's action against Rohith, the suspension of the stipend, his removal from the hostel brought home to him once again the brutality of the reality of being a Dalit. She says "After a lifetime of struggle, we were proud of our identity as Dalits, yet it is that identity that killed my son."
There were no answers to her questions in the parliament debate. Why was Rohith called an anti-national? Why was his stipend suspended? Who is accountable?
So no, Radhika has not got justice. She wants a Rohith Act, amendments to the SC Act to include a section against discrimination in the educational system. She wants to set up a trust in Rohith's name and help a hundred Dalit students to do their PhD. Yet, she tells her younger son Raja who wants to do his PHD, "No I won't let you go to the university to be killed like Rohith was. If there is a law against discrimination in colleges and campuses, only then I will send you. Today, every Dalit mother is afraid of what her child will face."
The government's histrionics in parliament cannot silence her voice, nor obliterate this reality.
The shame of it is also that the government has reneged from its promises for compensation and a job for Raja. They have not received a single paisa, leave alone the five lakhs declared by Chandrababu Naidu's government. He is a young man carrying the heavy burden of the loss of hope caused by the institutional murder of his elder brother. Raja is an MSc, working on a contract basis in a research project in the Institute of Geophysics in Hyderabad. He should  be offered a permanent full-time post in a government educational/research institution with proper accommodation. This will enable  the family to live together and help each other heal from the deep wounds inflicted by India's systemic caste-based violence, that, in Rohith's case, was intensified by the actions of a callous central government.(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Yet again low level politics being played. Brinda could have raised these questions by herself instead of needlessly bringing in his mother. It is a typical attempt to play the emotional card with mother sentiment. Every criminal have a mother and every innocent have a mother, but all the mothers have the same affection and feeling for their sons. That is irrelevant while discussing the legalities of the case.

                            you should be ashamed of your intellect when you say " Smriti Irani's performance". All you alligations she did everything are wrong. There is pending investigation on this matter please wait for it to conclude. Neither you are capable of telling anything truth nor intellectually capable judging any body right or wrong. The only thing you may be capable of is to do politics.<br/><br/>
you para 4 is ridiculous, there is a pending investigation why are jumping to conclusions. Are you educated enough on this ?<br/><br/>
I am deeply moved by the by Radhika's survival. There are so many people in India who may be dalith or not and we all need to ashamed of i. But its just that we all do at different instances of life. But why are you opposing a fair investigation in all dimensions ? <br/><br/>
All the information you want to Rohits tragedy, will be brought out in fair investigation. Neither you nor any of us know the facts which must be out in public domain after investigation. With all your assumed intellect you should have known it.<br/><br/><br/>
Are you a fool, How will Radhika get justice with out investigation and going through judicial process. its not kagaroo courts that that are done by your alliance. Thorough due process needs to be conducted and guilt needs to be punished. There are lot of unanswered questions on how he was pronounced medically dead without any medical examination done till next day morning and how his body was hidden from everybody. Let the truth come out and guilty be punished.<br/><br/>
My piece of advice if you may want to take. don't play with the emotions of a grieving mother and play politics on philosopher/child death. its not good for your elite intellect. It demeans your position people have given you.

                            Ms Karat it is indeed sad that you call the passionate speech by Ms Irani as "performance". I say, what you write over in this column is performance and a very bad one at that.<br/>
Question the ministers as much as you want to and they should answer. And answer Ms Irani did. With nothing left in your armoury, you bring in this rhetoric. Did Radhikaji tell this to you in person? I am certain she didn't.<br/>
It is a figment of your imagination. Trust me, people now see through you and your policies. This divisive politics that you have been playing for so long is now going to be a thing of the past.<br/>
My personal advice, try doing something constructive in your life, if you have a life.<br/>
P.S. - Rohith in his note did not indict anyone. Period.<br/>
What about the charge that he was a Yakub sympathizer. Is that not a reason good enough for the University to take action.

                            Hello Mrs.Brinda<br/>
I read your post, passionately written, designed to stoke lot of sympathies. At the outset let me say, I have nothing against Rohith or Radhika or Raja, who are all like brothers and sisters, just like any other fellow Indian. But still I am compelled to ask some questions to them, through you, of course. If you can find answers please let me know,<br/>
1) Rohith, supported for his studies by a determined yet poor mother Radhika, went to Hyderabad university to pursue his doctoral research. Instead of focussing on his research and getting a degree, settling in a good job, earning money and putting a full stop for the sufferings of his entire family, who are dependent on him, why he chose to be part of the students union (right or left does not matter)and engage himself in activities that are not connected with his academic work?<br/>
2) Why he chose to be part of certain gathering, which was organising pro-afzal guru protests?<br/>
3) Why he engaged himself in a violent attack with a rival students union?<br/>
Unfortunately brother Rohith is not living today to answer my questions, it won't be fair on my part to post these questions to the grieving mother and brother. So let me put these questions to you. Why instead of focussing on their studies and fulfilling the hopes of their families, these young lads land up in dharnas, agitations, etc etc? Are they being brainwashed and misguided by some narrow minded organizations, who want to further their narrow ideologies and politics? No I am not accusing you Mrs.Brinda, I am seeking answers. Answer me if you can

                            The nub of the whole affair is why and how " a Bharat Mata's son" was declared an extremist and an anti-national by Bandaru Dattatreya and endorsed endlessly by Smriti in her ministry's repeated letters to the university authorities to expel "Bharat Mata's son" from the university and staunch his stipend.

Those who killed this teacher was his old friends and comrades of CPM .This happened before three years and incident took place in kannur kerla. Last month CPM goons killed an RSS worker in the presence of his old aged parents. CPM students would have forced this dalit students Rohith to commit suicide in order to get political mileage to corner the government. CPM is dangerous to our people and society. They are chinese coolies and funded by missionaries and congress.

So Late Mr.Vemula grew up under very difficult circumstances. This is very much possible. If that be the case, then shouldn't he have had his own life in focus before anything else and tried to secure himself a good job and make the life of his mother and siblings better? He was an intelligent student. Why couldn't he put his intelligence to good use, rather than get it involved in politics? He should have known his responsibility to his own family. People who struggled to get him to where he was.But no! He chose to shout slogans, pick up fights and then end his life. If this isn't selfishness, what is? Did he even think about what his family would go through because of this brazen act? And all the politicians come out of their burrows to play the blame game seeing this as a juicy opportunity. Have some shame!

                            The hardship that Rohit's mother has gone through and the way Rohit took efforts in his education are worth highest of the praise. Yet this is not the only example and surely not only the 'Dalits' who go through this. There are hundreds of examples of similar mothers and their sons even though from upper cast who go through similar circumstances. One thing I fail to understand is that how did all this 30 years of agony of this mother happen in Congress rule. I bet there will be more similar stories in West Bengal which has been ruled by Left for decades. If they are so concerned about the plight of the dalits, why is it that after so many years of their rule things are so bad?  <br/>
You cant hold the current govt responsible for this.<br/>
What Vrinda fails to mention is that there were 8 similar cases of suicide in earlier years in this university. So it is more of a systemic and social problem than a problem of political pressure as it is being made out to be. <br/>
The problem with our politics is that they need cast identity to put emotional angle to any case. The basic problem is left aside and the cast/religion of the person takes primacy in the debates. Lot is said about the cast discrimination, need for more reservations, emotions are flared up in other students who may be going through similar hardships and they are dragged into the politics of the incident rather than they getting guidance and the much needed emotional support. Media who is expected to do objective reporting also gets lost in the policts concentrating only on cast and religion angle.

                            Why are we always playing a divide India card. He was a Dalit, he was a Muslim, he was a Christian and hence he was cornered and targetted. When will the political parties rise beyond the votebank politics. How many times have we seen this "I am a deprived" card played. Even the privileged like Azharuddin, SRK, Amir Khan cant resist to play that card outside of politics. If you meet his mother again Mrs Karat, tell her exactly what the minister said in her response. She said that if this boy really hung himself and his so called friends who had nothing but politics on their mind really wanted his son to live then they would have taken him to a hospital or got a doctor to attend him asap. What was done instead, he was left there to die so that politics can be played in his name. Suicide is not murder. You killing yourself is an act of cowardice and I have seen anger in the eyes of a man whose son committed suicide and he is not complaining that the society is not fair. He was a non Dalit by the way and he could not handle the competition. May be Rohith also succumb to competition. I want to become Karl Sagan is a good dream but then his efforts to become him were not sufficient or he gave up. The university cannot do anything which would not let him do what he really wanted to do. Further he also was celebrating Yakub Memon about which I dont know how much he knows or knew. What is the connection between Yakub Memon and him being a Dalit which would make his hold such celebration. This is the teachings of your student organizations Mrs Karat which connect one type of injustice to another type which in this case is manufactured and that is that Yakub Memon is also a victim like you Rohith. And then the boy is lost. Your Mrs Karat and your student organizations which pry upon the under privileged of this country are the ones to blame for JNU and Hyderabad University incidents. So stop using Rohith's mother as a shield and say this is what I want and not what Rohith's mother wants.

                            Madam Brinda Karat, I really respect you, but when you write this blog on the sholder of <br/>
Rohith's Mother I think you lost with Smriti Irani as well as my respect too...

                            i have these questions for you to answer...<br/><br/>
1. What you the communists have given to India other than betrayal, once with china and now....<br/>
2. Other than creating strikes and unions, have you ever supported any industry or modernization...<br/>
3. It is not the frustration of not able rule India even after 60 long years, that you people are showing against BJP &amp; congress<br/><br/>
First you ask yourself have you provided to india then bark....

                            Hi Brinda, in the last election the votes slapped you hard. Today, Smiti Irani slapped political opportunists on the face. If I were you, I will quit politics. India will progress faster without you and Sonia playing games.

                            Last 60 years many meritorious students who pushed to the dark corner had the same questions to you and your supported party of congress. There was a medical student who hanged himself for ragging which happened in one of our prestigious institute - his mother too asked same questions to then education minister of congress. Did any answer came. If a Dhalit has beaten up some other caste, can that be consider lesser crime? Can law differentiate crimes based on the caste and religion. Communist is course on the country since they destroyed working culture, they destroyed economies, and they destroyed right to live dignified way. You must answer many questions before any one else answers to you

                            90% of the people who are banking on Rohith's suicide do not know what actually happened in the university prior to that incident. <br/>
STOP politicizing it and let investigation take its place. <br/><br/>
Its appalling that every there and here, Rohith's name and Dalit identity is brought upon where those people did not even know him.

                            His mother's story is irrelevant here. Just because he and his family had gone through struggles does not give him right to defend traitors and terrorists. If he was not suspended, it would have  been an encouragement to anti social elements.

                            Dear Ms. Radhika, I quite agree with your contention that it takes a lot of hard work to reach the level of PhD. But believe me, it takes even more hard work to waste it and fritter it away on irrelevant issues (to a serious PhD student) like Yakub Memon and Afzal Guru. Let us leave them to the courts and other relevant agencies. One can surely feel about issues but it is another thing to be obsessed by them. Does getting obsessed by Yakub Memon and Afzal Guru indirectly indicate that PhD had become of secondary importance. After all how many would notice you as a successful PhD whereas a lot would notice you as a protestor against Yakub Memon and Afzal Guru's hanging.

                            A clear display of the subterfuge employed by the indian politicians and the Left in general. A heart rending story to establish the Rohit was a Dalit. But the real question is why was action taken against Rohit, was it only because he was a Dalit, or was it because his brand of politics in the campus was impacting badly the life of other students? Is Dalit a cover to get away with activities that may harm the society? Right or Left any attempt at disrupting the harmony of this nation should be dealt with Iron fist.<br/>
I am disillusioned with the left, in the past I have voted in some elections for their candidates, contributed whenever they come with their Hundials . I truly believed we needed the left. Not anymore , not this left, that has every intention of tearing at the very fabric of my nation.

                            Ms.Karat knows Rohit Vemula's birth details more than his parents. Even when Rohit's father told that they are not dalit's , this madam &amp; the media is bent upon forcing the entire family to be dalits. Now, he is no more Rohit Vemula but " Dalit Rohit Vemula " what an irony!! <br/><br/>
Rohit has gifted his life to the political opportunist's like Rahul Gandhi &amp; Arvind Kejriwal, poor Rohit would not have imagined the dirty politics being played on his name by RG &amp; AK. <br/><br/>
Rohit should have lived and justified his actions rather than commit suicide like a coward. I'm sure he must be repenting now, RIP Rohit.
