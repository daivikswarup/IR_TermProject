Headline::::Why Modi's US Trip Wasn't All That It Was Made Out To Be



DateTime::::2015-10-01T12:19:00+05:30




                                Prime Minister Narendra Modi is back from the US, and to read some of the encomia showered on him, view the breathless coverage on Indian media, and listen to the over-the-top pronouncements of government and BJP spokesmen, it would seem that this second trip to America was nothing short of the Second Coming. Mr Modi did well enough, but it was not the triumphal progress it is being made out to be, and a healthy corrective perspective is in order.
First, a lot of what made headlines in India - from the Strategic and Commercial Dialogue conducted before his arrival, to the four-second wave to Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif - passed under the radar in the United States. That was because Mr Modi had to compete for media attention with President Xi of China, who was on a charm offensive complete with knowing references to American writers and TV shows, and then with Pope Francis, who conducted an extraordinary Papal visit at the same time, cutting a swathe through American hearts and minds. The Pope was received with an adulation commonly only bestowed on rock-stars and newly-elected Presidents, and enjoyed gushing 24/7 news coverage. The Indian PM was inevitably eclipsed, and there's no shame in that. It's just that no one in India, following our news reporting, was aware of it.
The UN phase of his visit was largely routine as well. It was good that he spoke (albeit in very familiar terms echoed by a number of his predecessors) of India's commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and of India's stellar record in peace-keeping, as well as underscored the increasingly forlorn-looking Indian case for a permanent seat on the Security Council. But in all this he was doing no more than other PMs before him had done, and that many around him from other countries were doing as well. There was nothing exceptional here, and it also largely passed unnoticed in the world media.
The real triumph for Mr Modi was his California visit. Mr Modi not only made the first Prime Ministerial visit to Silicon Valley but met with the CEOs of top cutting-edge tech firms like Adobe, Facebook, Google and Tesla, pitching "Digital India" to a receptive audience where "StartUp India" and "StandUp India" went down well with the familiar "Make in India". His carefully pre-scripted Town Hall with Mark Zuckerberg, the announcement that Google would bring broadband to 500 Indian railway stations, and the Prime Minister's manifest interest in innovation and tech entrepreneurship undoubtedly made a positive impact.
But to acknowledge this is not to tell the whole story. You didn't have to listen to the liberal protestors of the #ModiFail campaign or read the petition signed by Indian Studies academics to know that Mr Modi's sales pitch battled a strong counter-narrative of his government's own making. While Mr Modi was smooth-talking in California, his government had shut down the internet in Kashmir for three days, repeating a similar action in Gujarat the previous week. The Modi government has also made more requests to Facebook to take down or delete "offensive" material than any other government on earth. This instinctive illiberalism does not go well with "Digital India". Sure, China has banned Facebook and Twitter altogether, but India is a democracy, and will be held to different standards.
Mr Modi is a highly effective salesman for India, and there is no denying the energy and dynamism he has brought to taking India's message abroad. But every good salesman is only as effective as his product allows him to be, and this is where Mr Modi's sales pitch falls short of reality. It's not just the openness of "Digital India" versus the trigger-fingers of the BJP government's censors. It's also the lack of substance behind his other claims. Bill Gates waxes eloquent on how important it is for Mr Modi to expand health care spending in India, but Mr Modi doesn't admit he has slashed the UPA's health budget by nearly 20%. Mr Modi releases a carefully-calibrated tear at the mention of his mother, but doesn't acknowledge his government has gutted the budget of the Women and Child Development Ministry. Mr Modi talks about the importance of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, but fails to concede that while its publicity budget has gone up five-fold, his government allocates less money to sanitation than UPA's had done (with considerably less fanfare).
In an article widely cited and re-circulated by Mr Modi's fans, The Economist sees three advantages that Mr Modi has in America over his putative rival, President Xi. As a politician who has risen through a democratic system, Mr Modi has the skills getting elected requires, including, the magazine says, a willingness to flaunt emotions in public, to hug President Obama, to weep with Mark Zuckerberg.... But even our PM's harshest critics in India would concede his flair for the theatrical. No debate there. Second, The Economist speaks of the enthusiastic support of the large and influential Indian-American community. But that would be true for any Indian leader: it has been exploited by Indian Prime Ministers from Narasimha Rao to Manmohan Singh, and the only difference is one of style and flamboyance, not tangible support, which is rock solid for Mr Modi but would be as well for any other New Delhi leader. Third, says The Economist, "the more China appears a threat to American interests, the more important India appears as a counterbalance." But that's the last thing India wants to be. Our foreign policy has its own bilateral imperatives when it comes to China. Serving as a counterbalance to Beijing to please Washington is certainly not in India's interests, or our plans.
So, to use an unfortunate Americanism (in the face of the culinary bigotry the BJP has unleashed at home): where's the beef? The bottom line of Mr Modi's immersion in Indo-US relations, once we get past the theatrics, is surprisingly thin. The US is already the largest investor in India, but there's been no significant uptick. As for trade, as US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker has repeatedly pointed out, India is still only the 11th largest trading partner and the 18th largest export market for the U.S. Mr Modi's speeches about improving the ease of doing business in India are straining credulity, since India has actually slipped in this 2015 report to an embarrassing 142nd out of 189 countries in the World Bank's rankings. And on defence and strategic issues, while India has awarded a $2.5 billion helicopter contract to Boeing, it's far from clear what Washington is giving us in return.
On the whole, a mixed report card, then. India needs Mr Modi to keep trying - and when it comes to the reality at home, as opposed to the sales-pitch abroad, we need him to do very much better.(Dr Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General.

                            Modi is all style and no substance. He talks big about equality but when it comes to implementing it,he is totally helpless or is seen even encouraging the right wing thugs. Modi is a good actor but a poor and heartless administrator.

                            A very well researched and nuanced article. Indian economic analysts have been berating the government over cut in budget for such important areas as health, education, sanitation  and woman and child development. It is time this government gave up its out and out salesmanship type attitude towards governance and hunker down to serious governance without any brouhaha and bravado

                            Hugging corporate honchos and shedding tears for them will do no good for India. For once, I agree with Kejriwal... Make India first so that corporate entities who are in need of profits will follow us on our terms. There is no free lunch Mr. PM. You hug them or shed tears for them them, they will come when they have a good deal. If we are smart, we will first clean up our mess inside and create an environment for our own version of Google and Facebook to take birth and serve the world. <br/><br/>
Mr. PM, just try setting up a small business in our country. It is as painful as it has ever been. The Babus make you run around from pillar to post and nothing moves without their "convenience charge". While you may make your high profile visits, the strength of Indian economy is when we build India for India first, and then India for the World. <br/><br/>
Just as a comparison, China's trade with the US is $600 billion whereas India's trade with the US is $60 billion. We do one tenth of trade that China does with the US. However, China has always been an aggressive trade and political partner to the US. They do not cry and bow down to the US for trade. It is a matter of creating an environment where countries find it win-win (or inevitable sometimes) to have a trade relationship. You have so far managed an excellent PR campaign. And that's it. Our car only looks flashy from outside, but unfortunately the engine and mechanics are the same as before. Or, in some cases, the execution has gone backwards because we are trying so hard to convince people that our car can run extremely fast just with some flashy paint. Wake up, Mr. PM., we have a lot to fix.<br/><br/>
Yes, I was thrilled to hear your speeches in the US. For the first time, an Indian PM is creating such a big stage for himself with NRIs. However, I am let down by your tendency to bash your political enemies and the India that existed before you became the PM. Let us understand that there is a greater purpose to be served at these forums. People elected you only because they were unhappy with the past. You don't have to draw your comparisons with the past, just so that you get a big applause. Time to live and deliver in the present. For, when you become past, you are judged by your actions and not by your grunts and PR campaigns.<br/><br/>
People of India have given you a great opportunity. Please do not waste time in mere PR campaigns. India wins when you win. I want your victory to be one that is true and fact based. A victory that really impacts the last person in our country. A victory where I can look at my day-to-day life and say, wow, my country has changed for good. PR campaigns are to sell stuff, I don't want to sell my country for sure.

                            Great Article. This is how a construction opposition should look like. Like Modi, you are also a great speaker and writer. You praise the government where it is admirable and you criticize where it is criticizable. (I can understand the political compulsion of criticizing your competitors.) I wish you were in Modi's cabinet, if not, at least leader of opposition. we already have the best PM Modi and best President Pranab Mukharjee of the Modern India. Now days opposition oppose government for the sake of opposing. You may be one of the few in congress who keep national interest above your personal interest or ego.

                            Every politician should be a good salesman. Their business is to market ideas, and implement those ideas if elected. Modi is a much better salesman than any of our previous PMs. The problem with the Congress is that most of them, including the Gandhis, are very poor salesmen. They do not have any worthwhile ideas, so the question of marketing them does not arise. in the 10 years of UPA rule, the only worthwhile achievement was the RTI Act. That also because of pressure from NGOs. I am sorry to say that Tharoor is also a poor salesman, especially of political ideas. He has survived, like all congressmen, through the power of unadulterated sycophancy. And sycophancy is not worth selling.

                            I think full Congress party is working really hard 24/7 to just find opportunity to criticize Modi rather starting to rectify their own mistakes due to which they are in this situation. They should really start supporting the good moves taken by Modi government to regain their plots in public rather going against everything which Modi does.

                            Paradox:<br/>
No Indian question's the adversity of leaving their own country to foreign for the sake of a better life. Leaving behind their own. Sacrificing those moments which could have been spent with their families together.<br/>
Neither the PM has vision towards that. Ignorant people of indian origin who are now American citizens celebrate him yet will not return back to India which some gujjus call "Ram rajya". What is a PM doing making foreign tours whimsically meeting CEOs and asking for investments without skilled manpower and world class infrastructure. Not to mention so self obsessed like a glam doll changing clothes 4 times a day, clicking selfies. Always finds the camera...even Zuckerberg is not allowed in the way! lol

What was Rahul doing in US and his achievements? Would it not be fair to compare the achievements and speeches of his predecessors from UPA including the speech of foreign minister Krishna who did not know even whose speech he was reading?

                            Mr. Tharoor's analysis may be right or wrong. But when he refers to BJP engaging in censorship, I can't help thinking about how congress tried to censor google and Facebook for carrying unflattering contents about Sonia Gandhi. Remember Kapil Sibal? I don't remember Shashi Tharoor crying foul then.

                            see the difference between Mani and Shashi. One is modi always a bashing and another is having a balanced view. I am a fan of modi as he is the only hope as a good leader among the pappu, lalu and khujliwals. No doubt he is a good sales man of a messy product but he is making an impact slowly. I think every Indian like it or not, should support modi for his term and then judge him for the next election. we have been ruled by congress for many years why not give full support to modi now? If his report card is not good after his term, I will be the first person to critizise. lets be fair to him and give him space for Improvement. at least think that we don't have choice with current leaders in India and support him.

                            Tharoor is, of course a self-appointed judge whose opinions only matter to a narrow circle of his champagne and canapés guzzling friends.  A simple analyses of his vacuous tome will show him for what he is; a 'wannabe' expert whose expertise is of no consequence to anybody that matters in India.  To start with, Modi was not competing with either Xi or the Pope in the attention stakes.  The latter two were in the USA for totally different reasons.  The Pope is bound to get more attention as he was there as a religious leader and as perhaps half the US population is Catholic, it stands to reason that the Pope will be received with adulation.  He wouldn't have received such adulation had he gone as an Argentinian priest which is what he was before. The 'liberal' protesters and the 'academics' carry nobody's support other than the participants in the routine 'round robin' petitions that are the hallmark of characters who would otherwise remain largely unknown.  I know!  Before the 2014 Indian election, here in the UK, we had such reprobates as Salman Rushdie and Professor Chetan Bhutt of LSE indulge in similar tactics.  Not only were they ignored but they were largely laughed at.  A similar fate awaited the Economist magazine which actually urged Indians to vote for the man now universally derided as Pappu.  Tharoor's article can be more comprehensively demolished but suffice it to say that a character like Tharoor who willingly reports to a semi-literate character like Sonia Gandhi cannot possibly have any credibility.

                            Mr Tharoor is an intellectual, but at times due to his political compulsion, he is so pessimistic about the situation. Things noted above as routine and nothing extra-ordinary are not judged on the basis of extra-ordinary progress that only happened under PM Modi's regime. Sad.

                            WEll, every salesman is entitled to some exuberance. Every salesman will (rather, is expected to) talk a bit more highly of his product than is the reality. Modi did nothing different. We are not disappointed. The country's intelligentsia will give the Prime Minister at least three years to show results. After all, he has to first bring India to 'zero' from the deep negatives that the Congress had plunged the country into, before showing something positive.

                            Shashi, I look upon you as a good intellectual, but I am sorry to say that your write up has missed a very important point about a prime minister branding not just the previous governments and the other political parties but even the people of India as corrupt. This is an utter nonsense and unbecoming of a prime minister. Probably yu missed how he dubbed as many as six crore families corrupt in one shot at a foreign soil in connection with LPG subsidy. Yes some people do misuse the system to consume more subsidy, but I can straight away challenge Mr. Modi that his figures was nothing but a nonsense. Linking LPG subsidy to Aadhar card is not something he has done is well known. Now he says that prior to this linkage, there were 19 crore families availing this subsidy, after this only 13 Crore are there, so where the rest have gone. Are moorkhon ke badshah, rest are still in the process of getting Aadhar card, yes the system is not efficient that you have issued Aadhar card to all the families. Even many people including myself are not getting the susidy, despite having aadhar card and doing registration multiple times - physically as well as online. So these are the issues, which a blind cannot see, he can see only the 6 crore missing figure. Here the corruption is not in the missing six crore families whose LPG connection is yet to be linked with Aadhar, rather it is in the mind of the Jhoottha - Labda pradhanmanti who keeps blurting just anything anywhere.

                            Dr Tharoor, now we understand the real import of your below statement<br/>
"But every good salesman is only as effective as his product allows him to be,"<br/><br/>
Its unfortunate that your party is doing its best to make the product (India) as ineffective as possible by repeatedly stalling the parliament and not allowing the Government to move forward on its economic agenda.<br/><br/>
Atleast reason to your HC to not continue the same obstinate behaviour in the winter session.

                            Dear Shashi,<br/>
Overall its refreshing to see a very balanced set of comments from you, as always. Nonetheless, i would like to express my opinion on some of the points you mentioned.<br/><br/>
After a long time, since passing away of Rajiv Gandhi, India has a leader who is passionate about the job he is doing. We have had scholarly Prime ministers in between, who no doubt had the best interests of the country in their heart but were found wanting in crucial aspects of leadership. A Country, as much as an Organization, needs an inspiring and passionate leader. And most of the leaders, whether in the corporate world or of Countries are really - the Salesmen! In Prime minister Modi, we have a salesman who is unhesitating in his efforts and belief, when it comes to sell India. I believe his strategy is a very simple one - How can i generate more jobs for the millions of youngsters this country has. There are a thousand threads that one need to spin and hope 10,20 or 50 of them would grow really long enough to generate employment. <br/><br/>
Without being baised, if one looks at the efforts he has taken in the last many months like e-Visa, frequent foreign trips, liberalizing FDI regime, it all points to the analogy of spinning 1000 threads. In a depressing world economic scenario with the growth sputtering in the big economies around the world, it would be unfair to expect a magic to happen here. Prime minister Modi has refused to get cowed down due to legislative paralysis in the Parliament with the hope that with a spate of state election wins, Congress Party is going to lose the majority in RS. Most of the legislative Actions would happen when BJP/NDA gains the upper hand, which would be starting from 2017. <br/><br/>
Instead of crowing that nothing much is visible on the ground in terms of an economic turnaround, why dont you help the governament by giving pin pointed actions it can take in different areas of governance. A country does not cease to be ones own because you belong to an opposition party.

                            I completely disagree to Mr ST views. I definitely dont have the language control that ST masters, <br/>
yet, i would love to do a logical analysis of some of his points that he put forward<br/>
1)He says that much of what made headlines in India were passed under the radar in the US.<br/>
Well, i think that would have happened with every other Indian leader in the US.<br/>
After all, even in India we don't end up broadcasting the news of the Nepalese PM visit 24*7.<br/>
That too when we already have the Lankan President in here as well(Just an analogy!)<br/>
And i am well convinced that in the recent times, this much attention  would indeed be the largest any Indian PM would have ever harbored.<br/><br/>
2) He does the sin of comparing apples with oranges.<br/>
 a religious leader with a political leader is simply bizarre. <br/><br/>
(And does not Shashi Tharoor know that China is bound to get more attention than<br/>
India in the world arena. Have we forgot the economies differences?)<br/><br/><br/>
3) He talks that India PM's talk in the UN was routine as always.<br/>
I dont think so, Meetings of the G4 nations on the sidelines would serve a good rebuttal argument to ST pessimism.<br/>
Well, at least he agrees to the fact that the earlier Congress PM<br/>
did a routine job while reading from papers during their speeches(Reminds me of Manmohan Singh)<br/><br/>
NAMO is putting his efforts in the country as well as when outside.<br/>
Lets patiently wait for these fruits to bear fruits and be optimistic. <br/>
Let me ask this guy what all has he as an MP done in these 16 months as the MP of thiruvanthapuram??<br/><br/><br/>
PS: I am no NAMO bhakt!!

                            I think media in India is over reacting about Modi's trip in USA. May be they are expecting a lot from outside India. Let me tell you as a NRI, India needs to change. Corruption is a bigger killer of Modinomics. Even I can smell of corruption from Indian Embassy in Washington DC when they rejected my wife renunciation of Indian citizenship. I became Indian Citizen in 1992 and she lost my Indian original passport. So she followed application procedure without passport. Indian Embassy rejected her "Deemed Surrender Indian Citizenship". Now who can beat that corrupted system. I am sure if I hire travel agent to pay them "Chai-Pani", I can get her deemed surrender certificate from them. In India, I learned when they ask too many questions and Issues, jut pay them off. That was one of the reason, I left India (two times).

Never before India was this dashing, bold and assertive. Shashi's article is balanced so I don't find any fault with it, he has also acknowledged many positive points from his trip. All the people cribbing about PR, try doing what he does, you will know. They can't even get more than two CMs together.

                            I have great respect for Mr. Tharoor and I will be the first to admit I'm not the expert on some of the topics he has written about. BUT one of 2 things is true:<br/>
 1. Either he has some extremely flawed arguments  <br/>
 2. This is poor writing and failed to mention his actual point<br/><br/>
The mere fact that budgets have been cut for sanitation, women's development or anything else is an absolutely terrible argument. Here's why:<br/>
 - India is a corrupt country and has been for years. The amount of money allocated to an initiative DOES NOT BY ANY MEANS represent the progress for that initiative. It could mean the money was being dumped into corrupt political coffers. <br/>
 - What is important is the results of the UPA in these initiatives over the years they were in power versus what Modi's results are OR will eventually be under the reduced budgets. If Modi has rooted out corruption, and is able to get the same or better results - who gives a rat's rear what the budget is?! He would be effectively using taxpayer money! If his results are worse, its something to reconsider and fling political mud about. <br/><br/>
Sure - reducing budgets might "look bad" but good governance is about getting results. Not putting random meaningless numbers on a piece of paper! I expect better writing from such a world renowned, respected and educated figure. For God's sake Mr. Tharoor, you were our candidate for the UN Secretary General! Please live up to your standards!

                            I doubt if anyone is listening, but thank you Mr.Tharoor, at least someone is speaking and trying to show the other side of the truth.

                            @SK, where can you see the money coming to India my friend??? Are you looking at the economy ? Even when Chine is faltering and everyone says this is India's opportunity we are focusing on lynching beef eaters rather than economy. C'mon man, I love the guy but don't go blind. He is trying but he is worst than Manmohan Singhwhen it comes to speaking his mind back home on what India is increasingly becoming nowadays. This is not my Inida and I feel I wasted my vote on BJP. I thought Modiji will lead and stick to the election agenda rather than turn out to be a helpless leader when it comes to Indian internal matters. I wish he man up.

                            1.) What kind of inferiority complex and ne-colonial mindset are you displaying when your yardstick for measuring the PM's popularity depends on his coverage in the US media? Even this argument falls flat as you yourself go ahead and cite The Economist's praise for Modi.<br/>
2.) You call Modi's choking up while recalling the hardships of his now ninety year old mother as 'carefully-calibrated'? You may have lost your human touch, Mr. Tharoor but millions of Indians do actually tear up when they recall the sacrifices that their mothers' have while bringing them up. Just how full of hatred can a person be when he questions a son's emotions about his mother?<br/>
3.) You are factually wrong when you say that India has slipped in the ease of doing business rankings under Modi. A simple Google search reveals that the data is for the year 2013-14. So, unknowingly, you have criticized your own government's failure!!

                            While it is true to a certain extent that realities on ground haven't moved with the pace that one would have desired, we actually have for one, an opposition who create a ruckus in parliament over big ticket policies without even engaging for a debate and second a laggard bureaucracy not doubt empowered by the previous governments to work this way. Business means profit and jobs, whether it's local or international. For something that crucial, a PM can and must do everything on his power to assure success of that and a public perception of the same. Whether US media took notice or not, is the Pope a rock star, does Xi watch TV shows is not our concern and shouldn't be Shashi's either. As an elected MP he has a report card of 16 months to present too. Where is that my dear?

                            Now I suspect anyone who is against what Modi is trying to do for his country. He is the first true patriotic leader in a long time. 100% Indian and proud of it! If you are for India and with India and not just in India, pl show solidarity with our leader. Don't spend your time in writing for NDTV. ....  Archaic news platform for archaic ideology out of step with what India wants and likes.

                            Tharoor used to make sense at one time, has now lost his marbles completely. To attribute anything positive about PM, as something which has happened in past with other PM's too, is simply scandalous and an out &amp; out lie. Fact is, never before has the Indian diaspora felt the way PM Modi has made them feel. Tharoor regurgitates outdated ease of doing business rankings, yet deviously shirks away from taking about the record FDI flow into India. Tharoor again shows his true colour by saying nothing about the pace of roads and highway construction which currently stands at 18km/day, on target for 30km/day. Compare this with 2km/day under UPA2. Mr Tharoor, you are no different to other Congressi's who have nothing to contribute, but won't miss an opportunity to slander the PM's name or his good work. I hope n pray that Congress is rescued to single figures in the next Lok Sabha elections.
