Headline::::Why Government Must Not Drop Petrol Prices For Us



DateTime::::2015-01-07T18:20:00+05:30



(Ishwari Bajpai is Senior Advisor at NDTV; he has been a journalist for 30 years, and has covered the elections since 1984.)The price of oil has fallen again.  The benchmark  Brent crude is below $53 per barrel. And besides spooking  stock markets around the world, it raises the question of whether oil companies will reduce petrol pump prices again or not. Last week, the government did not allow the price drop to change  retail prices, instead it raised the excise duty of petrol and diesel for the third time in two months to collect revenue. On eight other occasions, it has allowed retail prices to be lowered. It seems that the government is finally getting serious about the fiscal deficit. By raising the excise duty on petrol and diesel again, ostensibly for infrastructure, the Government hopes to collect  Rs. 17, 000 crores through these moves. The government seems to have decided that no further cuts are needed at the moment, and it is more important to focus on the macroeconomic picture than making the middle class happy. Of course, the Congress has criticised the government for not passing on the benefits to the consumer. Unfortunately, the Congress is taking an extremely myopic view of the economy, forgetting the problems at the macro level.  And the macro picture is not very rosy. Last week, the government was reported to have reached 99% of the Fiscal Deficit for the FY 14-15, and we still have three months of the year to run. This means that either government controls spending or gets more revenue or a bit of both. It may also be the reason that RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has been hesitant to cut interest rates since high fiscal deficits fuel inflation. And as one analyst pointed out, the money being raised by the excise increases cannot be for building roads - the Transport Ministry has not been able spend its allocations in the last two years, so it clearly doesn't need more money.   In fact, it would be a very good thing if the government raised the excise duty further, even if it meant raising the price of fuel. And there are a number of reasons for doing so. Firstly, our petrol prices are lower than China, Nepal, Sri Lanka and  EU countries, all of whom are major oil-importing countries like us. So why are we encouraging wasteful consumption? So that people can buy gas-guzzling SUVs rather than economical small cars? It does not make sense. The price of petrol (more about diesel later) should be driven not just by the worldwide price, but also by the need to encourage people to use it economically. Which means keeping the prices up. Since keeping prices up also allows the government to collect greater tax revenue from petrol and diesel, it helps keep the deficit under control.  Given that there have been articles suggesting that the Government's development plans are going to lead to a breach of the fiscal management plan (where the deficit has to be reduced year on year until it reaches 3% by 2016-17), perhaps raising the excise would be a better way to fund the plans than increasing the deficit. There are other serious reasons for the government to keep petrol prices up. The environment is one of them. And while this government has been accused of loosening environmental norms for infrastructure needs, it could use extra funds to finance urban public transport and cleaner diesel (Euro V),  both of which would help reduce pollution levels in our cities. To move to Euro V,  oil companies will have to spend a great deal to upgrade their refineries and a cess on Diesel would help pay for that. One could argue that this is a subsidy to the oil companies, but if you don't fund them, then they will have to raise the prices of petrol and diesel anyway to pay for modernizing their facilities. Public transport in our cities is desperately needed.  Delhi is heading towards almost 400 kilometres of metro by next year, but it is facing financing problems for the metrobus, and more importantly, it's struggling to keep metro prices reasonable. Already a long distance ride on Delhi Metro costs Rs. 21 ( with a peak price of Rs. 29) which means anyone travelling five times a week from home to work and back would spend over Rs. 1,000 per month on tickets. For the same Rs. 1,000 the consumer can today buy 16 litres of petrol which would run his motorcycle 800-1000 kilometres. So why would the commuter take the metro? Only because s/he cannot afford the capital cost of a motorcycle. All this sounds counter-intuitive. We need, if anything, to subsidise urban public transport, build more metros and have more buses. Cars and motorcycles must be kept at home and used for going out to dinner or shopping, not for going to work. High petrol and diesel prices combined with cheaper public transport will do that. (Of course we don't have to go down the Mumbai Suburban route and charge a niggardly  Rs. 215 for a monthly pass from Churchgate to Dadar -that  pricing has brought one of the best suburban transport systems to the verge of collapse). Finally, the other reason to keep petrol and diesel prices high is that this low-price regime is not going to last forever. Without too much discussion on the reasons for the current glut of oil and its low prices, suffice to say that low economic growth in China, India and the EU, along with a deliberate OPEC policy to discourage further US investment in oil fracking, is not going to last forever. And when prices rise, will the government allow the oil companies to raise the prices at the petrol pumps or will they like the UPA Government fear a public backlash? Given the fact that we now seem to have elections somewhere or the other  every six to 12 months, it is likely that the government will stall price increases. So it is better to take advantage of the current situation of low prices and keep prices reasonably high and collect as much revenue as possible. Assuming that oil prices remain low, the next fiscal would allow the government to collect a hefty amount of cash for fixing the deficit, funding urban and road transport. One caveat - the government should earmark a substantial amount directly to these areas rather than letting it all go into the Consolidated Fund of India where the usage is unknown. Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            You can't have double standard - when prices goes up, you hike in price but can't lower when prices are down. This is called LOOT by government.<br/><br/>
Government can control there unplanned expenditure to minimize deficit. can cut salary &amp; benefit of MPs. It is government's problem and inefficiency if deficit is going up. It means government fails in monetary control or presented wrong budget. In both case, government should suffer not people

                            Today because you have your favorite party in government your ppii is different. Provably you forgot how your favorite party criticised the government when it was in opposition on inflation &amp; higher prices. Now you are advising for petrol prices to be increased when the global crude oil prices ate at 40% of what they were in 2012 &amp; 2013. It clearly shows your &amp; your favorite party's double speak &amp; double standards.

                            How happily the govt bhakts explain away the increase in prices - that it will help government to make money. The same was said when train prices were raised.<br/>
This government is seen crying about lack of money bt when it comes to their personal matters they spend people's money without hesitation like giving expensive gifts and financing cronies or spending money on MPs of BJP still put up at Ashoka Hotel where the daily bills must be hitting astronomical heights.

                            To reduce deficit, <br/>
- Remove salary of all MPs who are crorepati (80% to 90% would fall in this cateogry) and give salary to only those MPs who are poor or middle class<br/>
- Remove pension of all MPs who are crorepati or have other source of income. Given pension only to those MPs who don't have other income source and are in really need of it. Also link it with performance criteria as a MP like minimum 80% presence in all session, no boy-coat, no hungma, etc<br/>
- To MP, Remove free 32 air-tickets and give only 2 (to &amp; fro) when Parliament session is on. <br/>
- Right now MPs get free unlimited railway ticket in first class, remove all this. Put limit 10 or 12 that also reimbursement on actual ticket production, not directly book on MP quota. Remove all MP quota<br/>
- Remove subsidy on Parliament canteen. When 90% MPs are crorepati then why they need subsidy on food?<br/>
- No toll-tax exception to MPs. They have to pay toll-tax and not VIP line on toll-tax booth<br/>
- MPs salary should be taxable <br/>
- Limit on free mobile / telephone usage. <br/>
- MPs should pay there light bill, gas bill on his own. Why people pay for there useage?<br/><br/>
Lets start with this and then ask common people to sacrifice on name of micro-macro economy.<br/><br/>
A very common man would make his budget based on his income. First he would find out his income and then prepare for expense. He would make sure than expense remain lower than income and he can save something for future. He would adjust his needs based on this.<br/>
But government first prepare expense and then income. In budget, whatever government project, in all 65 years, government's actual expense have always increase than projection in budget and income always lower than projection..! Means to show good budget or lower deficit in budget,government always gives wrong data and mislead not only parliament but whole nation.<br/><br/>
Government has thousands way to cut there expenditure but it always love to use of common man as he doesn't have any option. Either Congress or BJP or Third front - all politicians are same when things come to loot public.<br/><br/>
Government has more than 100% taxes on petrol and still wants too loot it more? In name of development tax, it increases excise duty but now all roads / bridges, they made by toll tax. Then why this collection? Even your report says that for last two years, this fund has not been used? They why to increase hike?<br/><br/>
Jaitely should remember that people who make Congress from 200 to 44 can do same with BJP if it believes that Congress is no more now and we can do whatever we want as people have no option (remember UPA too was believing same that no one would go with NDA on name of secular nonsecular and lastly all party would support to Congress..!) . So don't play with common men's hope. We the people of India are watching you...we will appreciate you when you would do good but don't think to throw you out if you continue to play like Congress loot.

                            Gas guzzling cars are not bought by the middle class.  the middle clas buys only small cars with good average. It is the  rich who indulge in wasteful expenditure and don't mind petrol prices going up or down by few rupees. But it does matter to a family with meagre resources. Why should the political parties do all this Nautanki by adopting different yardsticks when they are in govt or out of it. It is also a matter of principle that deregulation of petrol means market driven prices should follow. Also apart from Delhi, public transport system is in pathetic condition in most of the cities including Lucknow. It would be better to say that no planned public transport facilities exist in most of the urban India. Govt should look at other alternatives to coff up resources. Right now we are only having high hopes from the new dispensation with little concrete result. Don't see much difference between UPA and BJP govts, only difference being in the leadership.

                            Right conclusion through wrong arguments. Here is what is happening:<br/>
1. Price of crude is artificially depressed - to contain Russia and ISIS. The moment these threats subside, prices will be back to &gt;USD100 per barrel<br/>
2. Price of crude in USD is falling - and so is rupee's price. People won't see the same price fall while paying in rupees<br/>
3. And when the price of crude will shoot back, very same opposition will raise hell - so GoI is definitely grabbing the opportunity to control the CAD, Budget deficit and so on<br/>
4. And this Rajan and Jaitley pair is fighting in public but understands VERY well that by this is golden time to keep interest rates high (Rajan) and YET control inflation because of low crude prices (Jaitley)<br/>
Wisdom, guys wisdom! Such wisdom prevailed when RBI (along with China) hoarded gold. This is second such opportunity...

If I have to apply the same logic to food, this is what it will be: If prices of food items are low, people will buy more(leading to inflation) and eat more(leading to cardio and diabetic diseases). Hence keep the price of food items so high so that people dont eat and fall sick. This is a sick and illogical reason by a reporter with out any background in economics.  All he is trying to do is (a) please mody and (b) get buckts(bhakts) to support him.. LoL

                            The author's logic is stupid: deregulation means exactly the *opposite*. Government should just let the market determine the price, up or down. On fiscal deficit, well, the total extenditure at this time of the year for the last 3 years of UPA was at most at 93% of the allocation, and this year under NDA we are already at the 99% mark. This is BAD governance, particularly when Jaitley said he would keep the Chidambaram's fiscal deficit target: that looks *impossible* now with low income tax and revenues. So go behind corporates, get back back bad loans, and fix such, instead of interfering with the free market. This government has not a clue how to handle economy. The economy is surviving because of someone smart like Rajan: neither of the two high profile advisors (NIDI head/CEA) have any proven record of actual execution.

1. Why you think it is petroleum prices which is only thing to control the physical deficit , government has opportunity to earn 1.72 crore from spectrum sell and 1.82 from coal allocation .<br/><br/>
2. Second line of argument that lower petrol prices can increase big car consumption is good for economy since the derivative for car making like steel , rubber , technology , Labor  cost can give multiplier effect in economy which further fuel growth , employment and tax collection etc .<br/>
3. So far environment is concern there are multiple way to control is not the single way .<br/><br/>

                            It is always fascinating to read these 250 word prescriptive suggestions, especially on fuel pricing and transportation. A handful of Indian cities have a metro rail worth talking about ( in terms of coverage and people carried ). But all Indian cities have an average speed of 15 kms per hour - not only because of vehicular density and road space but due to bad road quality. Just count the number of 'speed breakers' on 10 roads around wherever you live. <br/><br/>
If we could reach destinations faster and at a steady pace, we would probably consume less fuel, be more productive and save a ton of money for ourselves and the nation. <br/><br/>
That money can fund all of the things the author has spoken of.

                            Agreed on environmental impact but other logics are just promoting governmental inefficiency to be funded by public. A cess on petrol was being levied for more than a decade to fund road projects and what we have is more of toll roads. Consolidated fund of India is a black hole. Toll roads can be built even through borrowings or PPP models which have greater accountability. Lower fuel prices can leave more disposable income in the hands of larger section of people which in turn can enhance spending power or savings resulting in greater GDP. The money can also be used by the actual road users for paying a toll. Even cost of public transport can go down. Modiji propagates efficiency, so then why not take this to his fiscal management also and give achhe din to the public early, than only lip service.

                            Corporate funded article. <br/>
If price rise in international market by 1$ per barrel, companies started making noise.<br/><br/>
Now international price went down by 60$ per barrel(50%), just by reducing 10% (8-9 rs), they are silent. <br/><br/>
We are not asking to reduce 50%. But keeping cushion of 40% is also not good.

                            It is maddening to link Petrol diesel cost with inflation. there are 1000 ways to fleece tax from citizens. PRIVATIZE tax collections. Collect from MP's tax @ 40% and all earnings 100%, start with 100% taxation of middlemen in the trading business. fix construction norms and tax real estate, tax construction by 50%, fix small traders, service industries. Why still petrol and diesel is attributed as Luxury, very sad

With rising inflation, price of vegetables bearing down on the common man, the government must not hold back from reducing the price of fuel especially diesel for other perceived gains.

                            Report is Oblivious to the facts. India do not need to compare prices with EU and other countries because earning to spending (on fuel) ratio is much greater in India. Personal means of transport are the only possible means of transport in many parts of the country, increasing fuel prices makes life more difficult. There are many other measures to tackle fiscal deficit fuel is definitely one of them but cannot be the huge contributor.

                            This brainless author does not know the petrol prices have direct effect on inflation. High petroleum prices mean higher transportation charge , the higher cost of electricity, the higher cost of production.. An inflated economy can never be healthy for long time as people stops spending beyond their essential limit , their saving gets geoparadised and a nation with poor saving and selective spending can just mar the growth of base industries and utilities company . Which in turn could have a boomerang effects only . This congress styled FM Jaitley is a big feku and he will destroy this nation . I thought modi will change the destiny of

                            Please explain if fiscal deficit is a such a big concern - why our generous Mr.PM donating money on foreign trips???  - Also why not slash salary of all MPs and centre government employees by 10% to cover a bit (Reason1: when things are running good they do get salary hike. Reason2: in private sector when marker is not good then either company cut salary or sack)<br/><br/>

                            Here is one more reason. <br/><br/>
The reduction of Petrol or Diesel has not been passsed on to end customer. Most of the people using Bus ( both Private and Public) still pay the old price when petrol was like Rs79. <br/><br/>
The AUTO/ Taxi Have not reduced price 1 bit. The Heavy Transport has not reduced price 1 bit so we are paying same price that we paid when Diesel was at peak. <br/><br/>
Poor person or middle class consume petrol for two wheeler or cars and atmost the reduction would translate to Rs. 100/ month, The reduction would benefit  people driving expensive XUV or those who go on pleasure trip on weekends more then common person

                            This government is a duplicate of congress ... Indians have just a bad luck that no bloody politician are thinking for mass but their own ass .. Public should just revolt against the indisciplined regime . When you compare the big words of Modi and his idiotic action I feel he is unfit for this job . He is completely a feku . We had a big expectations from this PM but he is another failure.

                            I commend such a meaningful article written by the author that too on a NDTV website. Even I was questioning myself why the rates haven't dropped proportionally to crude oil price decrease, but now I have the answer and understanding. Congress/UPA Governments always gave free or subsidized amenities to people to lure them to vote and elect Congress every term. This increased fiscal deficit and to keep the deficit low, they stalled many developmental projects. In whatever projects they managed complete, every single project had some or other scam. If current BJP Government wants to keep the prices reasonable and use the additional funds for developmental projects, should not the educated readers here support that for betterment of our country instead of generalized view that every Government loots? Lets wait for the complete term and see where we as a country go.

                            Ishwarji  you should be made finance minister of india then you will be charging 500rs/litre to collect  more funds. I am unhappy about your comments  when prices sore Govt collected and raised price of the fuel. when it comes to reducing prices they say lot of stories. Now prices  are decontrolled means direct benefit to customers. Becos you are getting high salary hence  forgetting middle class. You people can pay 500rs/ litre also  what about middle class? Do  you forget them.

                            Autos, Taxis, Lorry Operatos, Traders have not reduced the rates thou there were some reduction in fuel prices. As currently global oil prices are falling/flucating, we need to be careful in price revision, as if case oil increases, Autos, Taxis, Lorry Operatos, Traders will increase price (thou it is not required as they did not decresed). So till prices gets stabilised, govt. should pass the benefit to all stakeholders and also make sure that any increase in the short term does not call price increase / inflation

                            I agree with the article, no need to reduce price. After all deficit is a big issue, more revenues are needed. In order to provide best services, then have to follow private organization like norms. Not always, but for now at least. People should not get panic, after few years the fruits will come and we will have enough incomes to deal with these charges. Keep hopes.

                            This story make sense if you have answers for the following questions.... <br/><br/>
1. Did oil companies give any promise or legal agreement to move to Euro-V<br/>
2. Will they reduce the excise duty if the oil price goes up again?<br/>
3. Do you think all the money (60% difference money per litre) goes only to givt. Don't fool us.<br/>
4. Can this government give a guarantee to keep (OR with little increase) the petrol and diesel price till the oil price reaches ~$120 ?
