Headline::::What Modi Established with Silicon Valley Focus



DateTime::::2015-09-28T19:00:00+05:30




                                Enough has been, and is being, written and said about Narendra Modi's visit to America coinciding with the annual gathering of the United Nations General Assembly. And while it is true that in the American media and popular imagination, the Pope is the real star, followed at some distance by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin, the buzz created by Modi is entirely friendly and non-controversial. Further, his other activities - meetings with global CEOs and later visits to high-tech companies in Silicon Valley - have been fruitful in that they have helped strengthen the new Brand India built around modern education, technology and entrepreneurship.
 
Modi has done two significant things on this visit so far. First, he's raised the diplomatic level of the visit by making reform of the Security Council and a permanent seat on it for India the central focus (even if my analyst's view is that we Indians lay too much store, almost obsessively, over what we see as a place at the global high table, not realising that even if this seat were to become a reality, the new Council simply wouldn't have powers of the old - and most likely, nor the veto. But it is still better than bringing petty domestic and regional disputes to the big gathering in New York). You look much more dignified seen in the company of Shinzo Abe, Angela Merkel and Dilma Rousseff in the new G-4, rather than going from one head of state to another asking them to restrain Pakistan from its support to terrorism.
 
Second, he has, for the first time, shifted the focus entirely to business, spending more time with global CEOs than with fellow world leaders. If economics is the new diplomacy and key strategic interest, Modi has made a firm direction shift.
 
But we Indians suffer from a chronic disease: it is called declaring victory too early. We get carried away by a little bit of good news or success, just as we get depressed by a couple of setbacks. In this case, we are quick to hail our prime minister as a rockstar among global leaders, overlooking the fact that his celebrity is a reality, but mostly confined among overseas Indians. Certainly, he is our globally best-known leader since Indira Gandhi, but a leader's stature is as great as that of his country. We should not confuse a leader's popularity with our own media and overseas residents to be a great Indian arrival on the global scene. A lot of hard work still remains to be done there.
 
For a nation and its leader to acquire real stature and attention globally, it has to become a dominant economic power (as China is), a stabilising and leader-like regional influence (like Germany), a strategic threat (like Russia) or, at the other extreme, an international migraine (like Pakistan, in Madeleine Albright's words, not mine).
 
India's economy is growing, and showing great promise. But it has a long way to go. It is a lazy thing to say we are the second-fastest growing economy in the world and may even beat China in pure growth rates soon. It overlooks the point that the size of our economy is still quite small compared to the big powers, and it is abysmal on per capita basis. The rest of the world, by and large, hails our progress and promise. But today, with hyper-communication and also focus on India, many of our warts too are more visible. These include inequality, caste-based discrimination, poor hygiene, disastrous air quality, crimes against women and now the latest self-inflicted calamity: our ban culture.
 
We have seen our leaders rise to global stature in the past, and the reasons were evident. While Jawaharlal Nehru's stature drew from his own intellect, authorship of significant books and role in the freedom movement, it was also enhanced greatly by India's stature as one of world's poorest countries that successfully fought for freedom peacefully and then gave itself a liberal, democratic, secular constitution, accommodating so many diversities. But because India's economy and military power didn't grow to match that stature, it inevitably declined along with Nehru's after defeat by the Chinese in 1962.
 
Similarly, Indira Gandhi came to be acknowledged as the leader of the non-aligned world and rose in global power and attention with success in the Bangladesh war in defiance of the Nixon-Kissinger America. But once India's economy struggled post-1971, mainly because of her unwise and cynical shift to the Left, leading to imposition of the Emergency, India again lost its respect and Indira Gandhi was seen as an embarrassment.
 
India has a record of promising the world wonderful things, in flashes, and then failing its expectations. Even the growth burst after the 1991 reform, and then a great decade between 2000 and 2010, was lost in messy politics or ideological confusions or both.
 
The rise of Modi with a full majority in Lok Sabha after 30 years has again raised global expectations. India cannot afford to under-perform yet again and disappoint the entire world. Remember, a nation cannot ride the popularity or global respect in which its leaders are held - it is entirely the other way around. A leader is as powerful and respected as the nation he leads. That's why there is a great deal of work left to do at home when Modi returns.(Shekhar Gupta hosts 'Walk the Talk' and 'Chalte Chalte' on NDTV.

                            True that. The article isn't plain Modi bashing - for a change, Guptaji has curbed his basic instincts to write up a balanced view. Agree, long way to go and agree, we have had such expectations in the past. The true change in terms of that is Media and Social Media - average Indian isn't an uninformed poor bloke who believes in election promises. Now everyone asks for report cards and demands action against VVIPism. Again, we might at times be a bit to impatient, as Guptaji said, but looks like India is off in right direction.

                            Very good article specially the part about Indian's jumping to victory and despondency quickly. <br/><br/>
Under Modi, I think we are on the right track. Many of us are however, losing patience with the incremental steps he is taking to develop India. We gave him a majority after 30 years and expected him to make sweeping changes and deliver results within a few months but that's not going to happen is it? Hopefully, the opposition too puts the country first before their hatred of Modi - country is bigger then your hate of Modi isn't it? Hopefully GST and other bills will get passed soon and we can get on the way to becoming a true super power.

                            I just don't get it - modi keeps talking about a 'changed india' on foreign soil? does he really mean india has changed so much in just the past 1.5 years? and fools are believing that? if not, then he is the best agent for congress because he is indirectly praising the work done by congress all those years. i can relate to what he says about how india WAS and how it IS now - but bjp was not at all involved in that transformation.. isn't it? congress should take this on their stride.

                            As always great article. Shekhar is always well balanced and unbiased in his approach - hence enjoyed reading it. I agree that Modi need to do lot more at home to grow India to its potential. We have good opportunity here, the global economic scenarios, oil prices are all in favour of India. Both FDI and local policy/implementation is required to achieve this. We need bot sales man and delivery person in Modi. He is doing an excellent job doing the sales aspects. The delivery is more complex - and Modi legacy will be judged on the based on it.

                            Guptaji, None is saying India has achieved everything, not even Modi is claiming that. But what amazes us the common citizens but not the Lutyens Journalists like you is that He's putting his best efforts to pull the country out of the mess created by Communist rule of Congress. His own supporters are critical of him and his govt for slow pace of reforms but certainly there's a thinking behind the way he's pushing, fast or slow.

                            No one thinks that the work is done and has declared victory but what has happened is that Indians can feel proud after so many years of looking like a poor cousin to developing nations where politicians wear our poverty status as a badge. The groundwork has been laid and now serious work needs to happen. The question is whether we as Indians will support this initiative and take this opportunity to bring new investment and jobs to India or are we going to take our comfortably negative stance and hurl criticism and abuse from the sidelines.

                            I prefer opinions by Shekhar Gupta and Shashi Tharoor anyday over MSA or Kesavan. Gupta and Tharoor have constructive criticism which is good for the country. On the other hand MSA etc are driven by pure hatred for anything Modi does or says. Such blind hatred can actually topple down the country on all fronts. This is evident from the fact that Mani Aiyer goes upto the length of praising Pakistan just so he can bash Modi.<br/><br/>
I think people like Shekhar Gupta, Shashi Tharoor and others in the same league should be appointed as Shadow Council of Ministers (like in UK).

                            The modern education , technology &amp; enterprenourship is due to Congress policies, the foundation laid bye Pundit Jawahar Lal Nehru, modern push for technology by Rajiv Gandhi, Narsimha Rao and Dr. Manmohan Singh's lead opening of economy and structural changes, has brought rhythm of growth in India . It has benefited the world also as India has generated skilled work force. These RSS BJP right minded thoughts actually hated it and kept majority India under a wrong impression by muted their stand on it. They jealous congress that why people across religions and particularly Hindu community grown with Congress.Congress need to keep its esteem intact, they will come back. PM Modi is just reaping the benefits with media in his hands.down with RSS BJP .

                            I agree with Shekhar that "A leader is as powerful and respected as the nation he leads". The nation is great not only if it has a great economy or military. To be a great country in the current global scenario, we have to ensure, each citizen feel that they are safe in their country, they can state their opinion with fear or intimidation, they can follow the faith without the treat of being beaten up or killed. The most important point is that the country or the government or the resource (like education, health, food) should not be for the top 10% of the population. To achieve the above and to become a respected and powerful nation, we have a long way to go.

                            Hi Shekhar, <br/>
Great article, but one sore point, which, I think, is a fundamental issue with our current thinking.<br/><br/>
Specifically, your statement in the last para "India cannot afford to under-perform yet again and disappoint the entire world".  <br/><br/>
I hope that by the entire world you meant a specific emphasis on "India". The most important people we, as citizens, governments and bureaucracy, cannot afford to disappoint are Indians. If we focus solely on the aspirations and objectives of the common Indian, everything else falls into place. Any investment we seek from overseas should be seen from the perspective of the normal citizen (yes there are super-normal citizens in our country - basically anyone with social, economic or political power). <br/><br/>
Lets focus on improving life as it is and future prospects for our own citizens. The world will play along if we are focussed - the world needs India as much as we need the world - for multiple reasons. <br/><br/>
Regards<br/>
Prashant

In fact, if Shekhar Gupta tells me the name of the politician, I can tell him what does he think about him. There are many such journalists in India with such strong opinions.<br/><br/>
I believe a journalist needs to do a neutral analysis of a present case and not color it with quotes from the past. Else we continue to live in past overlooking what the present has to offer. I know its easier said but it's not easy to do so.

                            Sir - this leader is seemingly a global icon and likes to talk about his intentions a lot...but Indira Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were millenium icons who became what they were after years of administrative work. There were a lot of freedom fighters but Pt Nehru had some special qualities which made him unique and stood apart from other freedom fighters...but the current PM of India has been at helm for less than 2 years and prior to that his role was confined to 1 out of 25 odd states so you yourself are counting the chickens too early leave alone the Indian citizens...moreover is it only the leader who will do the remaining job - I think it is a country of 1.2 billion everyone has to do their bit but would you not expect the ruling party govt to include the people with right profile and mindset in their cabinet...Instead what we seen is they are mainly vocal about ghar-wapasi, meat bans, religious sermons and cheap politics...many of them have corrupt, criminal profiles and sitting inside the Parliament how can you expect them to succeed in taking the country to fulfill its dreams...today in all the NDA ruled states you hear about crimes of the highest order including Vyapam, rapes, murders, cash-for-votes and what not. I still fail to find how only a rockstar showbiz can set the course and focus for years of hard work and leadership in taking the country to another level !!

                            As I started reading the article, was apprehensive what Shekharji will write. Knowing his other write ups in past. For a change, it was quite a neutral opinion which most well reading and positive citizens may agree with. Pl send a copy to the PM, to caution him, while he develops and throws ideas, lot of dirty work at ground level needs to be accomplished. Although the responsibility lies on every citizen if they want to dream as big as the PM professes, they need to reorient and walk with the dream journey in fullest. Otherwise, he will be proved to be a Feku, which I believe is not. How wonderful to be in front of visual and print media, if they too join in driving positive momentum( I am not  necessarily saying joining Modiji, but can drive him towards). It will be more educting, participating and intellectually growing citizenery. Most medial has become so much distasteful due to highly biased/ lopsided/negative/ shortsighted/TRP oriented/ poor quality coverages and mindsets of ill informed, low intellect reporters. Can media themselves take an oath of sanctity? Can they resolve to operate first for general good of country and its ppl with a global vision of future? Can they restrain from kicking again and again sensitive issues? Can they act as an interface between governance , governed and government? OR they just be trigger happy as a bystander keep judging and commenting on everything seen, said and sold? Can we leave behind past, gandhies, nehrus, Akbar,birbals, Aurangzeb, Veda and Quran,coal gates, kalmadis, gothara and ayodhya and even sagar kart and ambedkar? Can media not only focus on future, educate the uneducated masses to think of only future? We would have solved most problems of 15% population of this world!<br/>
Shekharji , do you think you and your compatriots are there?

Is this because, we feel uncomfortable with a common man becoming a PM, however talented he is and more importantly we want a prince born with silver spoon to occupy the chair, even if his IQ levels are abysmally low. We know SG will chose not to answer. But he very well knows that these are important questions that the Elite English media has to answer. Hope we get to see that one day in the near future....

                            Dear Shri Shekhar Gupta. One and half year ago, no one from my office knew about prime minister of India. Even if there was some talk about India that used be poverty, rape, child labour, arrange marraiges and cast system. Now almost every one knows about modi. They see him as emerging world leader.  They ask about him. One friend of mine from Australia wrote me an email about Modi phenomenon during Modi's visit in Australia.  Please don't compare some "emergency" criminal  with Modi. Modi has worked hard to rise his rank through his people friendly governance,  development and commitment of delivery unlike those who are born with silver spoon and looting this country since last many decades.

                            Good article and agree with Mr. Gupta. Just adding my $0.02 worth. I think Modi loves the spotlight. He is definitely more of a showman than any other PM of India. We're still within the first two years of his rule. So maybe we can say that he's still enjoying his time in the sun. But I hope that his tendency to seek the "rockstar" image &amp; status will change with time and that he'll grow more mellow in that respect.

                            Well written. The problem with Modi is that he keeps talking big outside India but keeps quite when issues like banning things, minority bashing etc. There is discrepancy between what he says and what he does. Eventually people and other countries will come to know his dramabaazi

If we as a citizen do not make the impact to the world as Modi has pictured out, we as nation are failing.<br/>
It is duty of all citizen to get India again on forefront and make that powerful and amazing presence again, Modi is motivator here but not the actor. We citizen are the actor and need to buckle up.

                            When you say foot in the mouth, the biggest one was when in california address the PM said "I want to grow India economy from current 8 trillion USD to 20 Trillion USD".<br/><br/>
This was the biggest gumboot in the mouth. We all know current Indian economy is 2.3 trillion USD. So how did we become 8 trillion overnight?<br/><br/>
And incredibly, no one is panning the PM for his utter lack of knowledge or facts!<br/><br/>
Maybe people are used to his flourishes (Remember" China spend 20% of GDP on Education" etc) .<br/><br/>
Subramiam Swamy calls RG "Buddhu". I think we have a new and stronger contender for the title!

But the leaders of other countries are no fools and see that Modi's escapades around the world with internal political reflection in every speech hint a strain of dictatorial behavior. Narcissism and power greedy is what everyone with grips is seeing what most Indians hate to see.

                            Modi loves to spend time and energy outside the country. Main reason for this is that at home he has not got much to show for his time at the heals of the affairs. whereas being away gives him and his supporters perceived (false) sense of popularity and statesmanship. God knows what he is trying to achieve. At home he wants to kill social media but in Silicon Valley he is desperate for a hug!!!!

                            But we Indian media writers, presenters and hosts suffer from a chronic disease and that is called whine more than necessary than just highlighting gaps. Of course all the gaps Shekhar has pointed for us as a country is well known and no one is walking with his / her eyes closed. At the same time this world is about information overload and a leader like Modi is well aware of this phenomena and taking advantage of the opportunities to further India ambition.

                            Modiji please don't be emotional talking about your family and mother. Democratic, secular India is proud of your achievement electing you to the highest office of the nation. You are the leader of India. One billion Indian are looking for your leadership to pull them out of poverty. When you are traveling to foreign lands don't be emotional reminding your family background, be like knowledgeable, wise, diligent, smart and business like. Emotion has no place when you are dealing with world class technologists, business leaders, world leaders, you have to deal like a world class foremost leader who means business.

                            I am a bit pained to see report cards about Modi's visit to the silicon valley. I think its fair to say that irrespective of the media house one thing has been clearly missed. PM has been consistent is his building relationship with top people and country and this eventually has given a massive amount of confidence to people like me who wants to move away from being a employee to an entrepreneur. This motivational factor is un-measurable and the impact will be felt for a longer time even after Modi is gone.

I would be very happy if Modiji falls under the list of great leader like Lee Kuan Yew but this to happen, he has quietly deliver and let the time put him into that esteemed category rather than he declaring himself being a great leader.
