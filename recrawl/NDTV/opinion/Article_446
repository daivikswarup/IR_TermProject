Headline::::India's Daughter: Ban Those People With a Repulsive Mindset



DateTime::::2015-03-06T03:00:00+05:30




                                
	(Poonam Mahajan is a BJP MP from Mumbai)
	Her name means light, which faded away because of the torture and suffering inflicted by her perpetrators. The heinous act ignited impassioned pleas for women's safety across the whole country. The recent furore over an interview of the rape convict in the Nirbhaya case to a British documentary film-maker has once again brought the spotlight on the repulsive mindset of many men towards women in India. The documentary is an excoriating critique of how men perceive women in India.
	 
	The government has reacted to the pleas made. However, in our country where freedom of thought and expression are cherished and battered simultaneously, we need to now look forward and ask: where are we heading as a country?
	Should it be justified to say that a girl who leaves her home after 9 pm is bound to be raped? Or should a defence lawyer say that he is ready to burn his wife or daughter if they are found to be with a man? Are we so worried about showing this disgusting mindset to the world? Shouldn't we introspect and act on it instead? Will the defence lawyer ever imagine an iron rod being forcefully inserted inside his own wife or daughter's body and their entrails removed? Or would he perhaps not object to it because he would rather pour petrol on them and burn them alive at his farm house?
	 
	We need to learn, listen, adapt, accept and act on problems that plague our society. We need to move away from this mentality of reacting or never acting to resolve core issues.
	It is extremely painful to see a girl who aspired to be a doctor with a dream of establishing a hospital in her ancestral village, with the aim to help poor people, fight for her honour and those %$%#&@# rapists smear her honour with reprehensible acts of violence. The country must know that there are many men whose mentality needs to be exposed and shake this patriarchal mindset that women are not safe.
	 
	A few months ago, during the Winter Session of Parliament, I had a conversation with my colleague from the Rajya Sabha, respected poet Shri Javed Akhtar, who asked me why a family celebrates the birth of a son but not a daughter. Why mustn't her birth be celebrated instead of just equating her with a Goddess? When a father, the head of the family, decides that his son and daughter are equal and this is established and practiced in every household, in every religion, caste and creed, then we won't need a broadcasting company to telecast the problems and suffering of India's daughters. We need to make our society and government sensitive to various kinds of issues faced by women.
	 
	It is not just the responsibility of an institution. It is India's duty to safeguard and uphold each and every daughter's honour and dignity.
	As the mother of a young daughter, I hope banning the documentary helps safeguard and uphold my daughter's and every Indian daughter's honour, but changing the mindset of those who have been portrayed in the documentary is more important. Defence lawyers are entrusted with defending the indefensible sometimes, but they are entrusted with defending them with law, not joining them in their repugnant mindset and polluting society.
	Only when such people are banned will my daughter's honor be intact.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            It appears that you too have deep rooted parochial mind set, let me quote you " As a mother of a daughter, I hope banning this documentary helps safe guard and upholds my daughter's and every Indian daughter' s honor..." What honor are you refering to? We are living in a 21st century were every human being needs to be respected as an individual. Anyone found violating any form of human rights should be punished by the judicial body under the law. In this context the word honor is one of the main reason for a mind set that reflects the people such as these lawyers.  Honor killings is one example. It is rather important that we educate our young people right from the early age about individual human rights and the necessary importance of respecting the rights. Any violation of human rights in any form will be punished by the judicial body under the law.

This doesn't sound like she's "writing against the ban..." more like obfuscating to the point of being meaninglessly banal.

                            Good points but that does not justify banning an eye opener documentary film about mind sets of perpetrators and victims. Real solutions can be achieved only by allowing real motives to be understood by all, this is what the film attempts to do. It's a educative film. More will learn from the film than from your written piece.

                            Thirty years back or was it forty years as young girl in LSR I went through protests on rape ( famous Billa-Ranga case); we did street plays on dowry deaths- bride burning; we protested the molestation of girls by Delhi University boys before Holi; we struggled through riding on DTC buses where we had to endure pinching, rubbing, stares, lewd remarks; favourite pasttime of delhi cyclists at that time was to catch girls dupattas as they walked by.......and now I see the saga still continues.......girls will protest, women will protest and then things will die down. How does one change centuries of archaic mindset. I guess protesting will not work - every women in India maybe go on strike ?! Unrealistic thought - but nothing seems to shake the medieval mindset of our men and even, sad to say many of our women too! Sad to see that the struggle continues and god forbid how many centuries more would the women of India have to endure this attitude. I guess we are all waiting for that Woman Avatar who will eventually take charge and stand up and lead us to change. Again wishful thinking. I have a sneaky feeling that the men, our leaders, think this is a huge joke. Watch think let them protest, humour them- eventually they will stop or lose interest. Do we ( women) have the courage to prove them wrong? I saw and met girls back then who went with us in all our anti anti dowry rallies, but quietly agreed to millions as dowry at the time of marriage. They didn't want to be left on the shelf. True they had a point; societal pressure, parents emotional blackmail and pressure sometimes gets too much. The struggle is not just about rape - the struggle for respect and dignity and the need for society to recognise that women/girls are individuals are human beings who have the right to choose - to lead their lives as they choose; just like men do.

Instead of banning it and burying the issue. Please have every Indian see it, learn from it and act towards making it a better worlf for women in our sickening society.

                            Very unfortunate country with such irresponsible people representatives. Do we have any statistical evidence for the so-called "repulsive" mindset of Indian men. No! Everyone wants to join the "politically correct" bandwagon. Poonam ji, do your father, brother, husband and son also have same mindset? If so why you are living with them? Tell your daughter not to marry any Indian. Not even have any relation with Indian men.

                            This documentary is not belittling the dignity of the victim or her family. It is showing that some in India still harbor medieval values that are considered inhuman in modern society. <br/>
This ban on airing is a restriction on free speech. <br/>
Free speech is not something you welcome only when it appreciates your values. <br/>
India wants to be recognized as a global player and Free speech is a first step in that direction.<br/>
So respond to criticism by changing and not by banning negative criticism.<br/>

                            Poonam's views is still beset with patriarchal constucts like "honour" which shouldn't be something a modern Indian women should be believing in. Tell me why does the girl have to protect her honour (or have it protected by the govt or her family) but a guy doesn't? If a girl gets raped, she has been dishonoured? How? If a girl is subject to vile comments on the street or from a criminal in a documentary, she has lost her honour? how? It should be the men who do these crimes-- raping, leching, molesting-- who should be losing their honour. How does the victim lose her honour? This self-deprecating mindset is precisely the sort of thing that sustains this cultural climate where "blaming the victim" is seen as acceptable.

                            I sincerely hope these sentiments translate into action.  Ban the rapist, ban the lawyers, banish the horrendous thought processes, not the documentary, if you can.  And remember, TV is only an insignificant small medium.  You can't stop anyone from getting the video from other sources.  I hope your tech savvy government realises that.

Are we living in the civilized, modern and democratic society or have gone back to primitive age?

                            This article is painfully regressive, and also inconsistent. She writes:<br/><br/>
"As the mother of a young daughter, I hope banning the documentary helps safeguard and uphold my daughter's and every Indian daughter's honour".<br/><br/>
Really? The "repulsive mindsets" against whom the author has written this piece are also guilty of associating "honour" with the woman whenever an unfortunate event occurs to her. Robbing away "honour" of the women gives her a sense of "shame", and it's this concept of "shame" that is used to repress her emotionally.<br/><br/>
The author would do more help to her cause if she argues on the floor of the Indian parliament to remove the unconstitutional ban on the documentary.

                            Your last para proves you more than a politician than a woman. Are you not feeling that these document would be an eye opener to the future generation? Rather than writing such articles, pl. go and ask you party man and your PMji status on the action to protect woman in India and how to change the education system to make woman as human beings rather than bluntly lying with things like Godess etc.

                            I am sure political affiliation will be faded away down the line (based on personal interest ). But a true humanity  will always remain as an eternal fact.  So please grown up and detach yourself from all kind of colors. Banning is not the solution, every one should watch this movie and learn the fact. So that people can act accordingly . Be courage enough to accept the fact.<br/>
By the way, i do not find any explanation by you how this banning will help our Great Indian Culture.

                            Kudos to you Poonam Mahajanji for speaking against the ban. Rajnath Singh and Venkiah Naidu made a<br/>
mockery of themselves and the Nation. They are the ones damaging India's image. Not sure if they even<br/>
watched the documentary. I watched it and couldn't help but cry at least 3 times during the documentary.<br/>
Went thru a roller coaster of emotions; anger, repulsion, awe, shame, admiration (of Nirbhaya's and her <br/>
Parents's resolve and hard work; of the protesters; of the justices on the committee), dis-belief, and<br/>
above all Gratitude (for increasing my awareness on gender bias, the mindsets of the Convicts, the wide<br/>

                            This article is so deceptive. You start out by expressing contempt over the repulsive mindset portrayed in the documentary. Then you give in to the same mindset later on by talking about safeguarding and upholding the honour of a woman. We have to change our mindset that a rape survivor loses her honour. The honour of a woman is not so weak that a rapist can take it away just like that. A rape survivor has her honour intact like each one of us. Rape is a heinous crime. The documentary has exposed the mindset prevailing in many parts of our society. It is reminding us that we have a lot of work to do. The documentary also shows the viewpoints of her parents. It tells the world that there are parents in India who are proud of their daughters and go out of their way to make their daughters dreams come true. After watching the documentary I remembered her parents more and developed a new sense of respect for them. Every one should be given the choice to see this documentary. We are a democracy.

                            This mentality of subjugation of women and domination by man in engrained in the Hindutva culture. It is surprising that how many people (men as well as women) while decrying such attitudes still support the party perpetuating that philosophy. One good thing which British rule brought was the reformation of many of the abhorrent practices that had been perpetuated for centuries and millenia by proponents of the philosophy, keeping nearly 90-95% of people as second rate citizens will curtailed rights.

We need to learn, listen, adapt, accept and act on problems that plague our society. We need to move away from this mentality of reacting or never acting to resolve core issues.<br/><br/>
It is extremely painful to see a girl who aspired to be a doctor with a dream of establishing a hospital in her ancestral village, with the aim to help poor people, fight for her honour and those %$%#&amp;@# rapists smear her honour with reprehensible acts of violence. The country must know that there are many men whose mentality needs to be exposed and shake this patriarchal mindset that women are not safe.<br/><br/>
A few months ago, during the Winter Session of Parliament, I had a conversation with my colleague from the Rajya Sabha, respected poet Shri Javed Akhtar, who asked me why a family celebrates the birth of a son but not a daughter. Why mustn't her birth be celebrated instead of just equating her with a Goddess? When a father, the head of the family, decides that his son and daughter are equal and this is established and practiced in every household, in every religion, caste and creed, then we won't need a broadcasting company to telecast the problems and suffering of India's daughters.

It is not just the responsibility of an institution. It is India's duty to safeguard and uphold each and every daughter's honour and dignity.<br/><br/>
As the mother of a young daughter, I hope banning the documentary helps safeguard and uphold my daughter's and every Indian daughter's honour" you are actually perpetrating the opinions expressed by the rapist and killers and their lawyers and all those who believe in "honour killing". The phrase "honour of my daughter" is the midpoint in a direct line between the need of the family to make sure that a woman is not independent, self-assured, docile &amp; subservient to the males in a patriarchy ....her being raped and killed is OK....as in the case of honour-killings. So in your slip of words you have unwittingly acknowledged the same mindset of the lawyers of the rapists, who said that he would burn his daughter if she defiled the"honour" of the family.<br/><br/>
Please do not try to stay with 2 feet in 2 boats for safety - a typical politicians posture - as its easy to fall into the water doing that. Young people are not stupid. They understand nuances and Orwellian doublespeak. They read you know, and you should too, maybe start with 1984 of George Orwell.

While she lists all the reasons why the film should not be banned, she concludes by saying her daughter's and every Indian daughter's honour would be saved by a ban on the film! Absolutely no rational reasoning!! That too coming from a person whose claim to fame is being the daughter of a rags to riches politician reputed to have made a fortune through dubious means including telecom spectrum allocations who was shot dead by his own brother due to petty domestic squabbles.

BJPtaards are sickening: you are just like other BJPtaards like Meenakshi Lekhi and Rajnath Singh who were more worried about tourist revenue and 'hounour' instead of acting.. Shame on you anti nationals...

                            The author is absolutely right when she says, "Defence lawyers are entrusted with defending the indefensible sometimes, but they are entrusted with defending them with law, not joining them in their repugnant mindset and polluting society." The ground reality is that law has miserably failed to attract talent into law. Ask students of Class X of any school in India that how many of them would like to study law. Hardly 1 or 2 students out of meritorious, will say yes to law as a profession. Even if some good brains go ahead and study law, they prefer to work for corporates. Out of the phe person who eventually opt litigation, a majority of them are the sons of established lawyers, sons and daughters of judges. Imagine the plight of legal aid system. These statements of defence lawyers is as bad as the act itself.

                            In curbing freedom of expression,Pakistan has a bad reputation,but an interesting scenario has emerged where some Indian movies receive double cuts in India and then in Pakistan.Many patriotic Indian movies were banned in Pakistan<br/>
for obvious reasons.At the same time non-political movies were also kept off in that country.Movie 'Dirty Picture" was banned in Pakistan on the ground that it's too dirty.Many more movies produced in India are facing rough weather.

                            Well Said Madam. Thank you for providing such a great opinion as a Woman. From very beginning of all I am wondering what we as people of India going to gain by watching this documentary? We all know that respecting everyone and specifically women is a basic principle of our culture.  Instead of spending time, energy and money for arguing that let the documentary be allowed to be broadcast in India, why we all don't do some constructive work so that this type of crime against women doesn't happen again in future? Let's every one of us all work towards respecting women and try to stop these type of crime. If we are able to achieve that then people will not make such documentaries to expose national shame to the world.

                            it was 1985 I was at the International airport in Delhi sipping a cup of coffee and I noticed a german teenager crying - I asked her out of curiosity - if there was a problem. She said she was going back - she had been teased and molested in Delhi and I was so shamed and could only say that not all Indians are like that. Dare I say that people from South of Delhi are are much better behaved when it comes to respecting women.

                            I partially agree with the author. In 21st century India has seen many changes and many are on the line. With what I don't agree is the lame justification for banning the documentary. And what honor does those people hold who uphold the notion that getting tourism money is more important than to change the parochial mind-set of society. On many fronts our govt. works like a total ignorant authority. As the documentary has already been aired, I don't think banning it in India will do any good on tourism front. So it is time to work towards the upliftment of the society as a whole and let people know what problems is still persistent in the country. Because hiding a problem doesn't mean they are not existent in the society. BJP must not forget their election slogan "Bhot hua naari pe vaar,......."

                            I Saw the documentary and cried for the poor girl  who was tricked in to the bus and essentially kidnaped and raped and brutally assaulted. Everyone in India needs to see this in my opinion. The only way to change a mindset is by opening your eyes to the truth - not hiding it.  <br/><br/>
Let us face these challenges as a society and educate our idiot men who think they're morally superior. <br/><br/>

However, make Indian streets safe and I will request Indian women to walk the street at anytime of night.  The root cause is the safety in India this is what we need to focus on along with fixing mindsets of these sick people.

                            Yes people of India iggnored the issue for such a long time and that is why we are were we are.  This kind of issue needs time to fix and can not be done overnight.  India needs fixing but we have to do it while still maintains some dignity and self respect.  This issue have been going on for such a long time why did these people tolerate it for such a long time.  Lord Krishna said if you tolerate crime you get the share of the blame.  So long as we maintain decent momentum we can fix this country.  But we Indians and outsiders must respect our legal system.  Foreigners have over past several years have disrespected our legal system and this should not be tolerated by people of India.

                            Let's talk broad issues, instead of focusing on single incident. Showing documentary or not is taken by right authorities. People who really support women empowerment should focus on "thousands of girls missing every year in Indi", "Too many road accidents happening resulting widows", "Air pollution" !!<br/><br/>
My observation is any incident happening @ Delhi given too much priority by National News channels. Some times I confuse they are New Delhi channels or National ?? :)

                            For those of you who have commented against banning this movie . I ask you all one thing . Let us do a documentary on any one of your Sisters , Your Daughters or your loved ones . Who is interested ? Can anyone volunteer ... Please .... If any ONE volunteers i will accept . I am 100% sure no one will .Saying comments on someone else daughters or family is easy we are not bothered . But just think it was one of our daughter who was raped and killed brutally. Nobody thought about the poor girl .You all want to teach some pervert by using someone else honor and dignity ... Beautiful . God Bless you all .

                            It happens in UK, girls going back after late night parties are raped and murdered till this day. Even brothers raping their sister (latest an MP's wife) and a step brother killing and cutting his step sister to pieces. This is crime ... prevention, security, education and punishment are the only way out of this I'm afraid, not some documentary glorifying a rapist. After 9 is late night, like it or not, and everybody knows it. unless there is fool proof protection, there is no point in taking the risk. It's like going bungee jumping and asking for a guarantee that the rope  won't snap when you know very well there is a possibility. Avoid it for your own safety. instead of blaming everything on Hindutva and the government.

                            Many people have voiced their genuine and heartfelt opinions on the documentary. I watched it as well and it's tragic. I cannot even begin to understand the pain of Jyothi's parents. It is going to take a lot of time and effort for the mindset of some Indian men to change. It's time to raise boys in our respective homes the way they are supposed to change. Trust me, India will and can change. We live in a very complicated/confused culture where people practice certain things even without giving it a a slightest thought.

                            Instead of blaming the government and Hindutva at every slightest opportunity, has anyone thought how this interview with the rapist will further encourage other would be rapists and uneducated mindset ( including children and youth) ...which might easily be influenced by his words ... by him not showing remorse and telling of burning his wife and daughters. You all blame Bollywood movies and all of a sudden a rapist's words and mindset has become so important. Education and prevention and security by government is the only solution, not a documentary that gives importance to a rapist's mindset. Next you'll be doing a documentary on a murderer to understand his mindset.

                            Even men can not walk in London after mid night. Not sure what is the interest of BBC to do this. Need to definitely look from political perspective.<br/><br/>
Yes there is a know problem in many parts of Indian society, where women are considered as lower breed by both men and women. Indians are now realising this but can not expect a solution in a day or two.<br/><br/>
Government must committed to do below so that the social thinking patterns and abuses against women changes slowly  <br/><br/>
1. Take care of all the neglected/un-educated children, who are potential offenders of the future. Good budget,Stringent mechanism to be put in place.<br/><br/>
2. In Andhra 95% of men take dowry. Givers, takers and Police do not bother. In such society, I do not have any ideas, how the message of equality of women and men can be taken convincingly. Serious debate needed by so called intellectuals and social scientists on how this can be done. Unless this mind-set changes nothing happens.<br/>
3.Serious flaws in implementation of laws which are made for abuses against women. Again  this need mind set change.<br/>
4.Govt., media, parents, NGOs and women themselves should work towards this change.<br/>
4.First priority of Ministry of Women and child development should be this social change .A separate TV channel for this cause can help.

                            I see that almost all reactions to the airing of this documentary are also suggesting a solution - mostly of "banning". Either the documentary itself, or like this writer says, the people who have this mindset. The problem is way too complicated to suggest such knee jerk solutions.All of us must understand that India is NOT like the US, UK or any of the western countries. It never was, it never will be. This country is one of the oldest civilisations in the world and has a certain culture associated with it. The question is not whether the culture is right or wrong : it exists. It is an irrevocable fact. Hence, any solution to the growing menace of assaults on women (sexual or otherwise), needs to be seen with this perspective. We have to have a group of intellectuals who should brainstorm and deliberate to come up with out of the box solutions to root out this problem.We can keep shouting ourselves hoarse about a male dominated society or a patriarchical system, but it will not change overnight!If a mindset is endemic in a society, we should accept it exists and seek ways to bring about a systematic change. This may take years. The fact of the matter is, the chasm between our "culture" and modernism is growing day by day, particularly at the turn of the twenty first century. While the traditionalists are sticking by their beliefs and convictions, the women of today are moving further and further away towards "modernism". The need of the hour is to bridge this gap. Therein lays the solution.

                            This rapist has a mental issue, like every other rapist. It has nothing to do with how men look at women. It is also the same as some people going on a killing rampage. They will definitely say they have no remorse and they are right because they are mentally insane. The very majority of Indian men respect women as can be seen in protests right after the incident, so this rapist doesn't reflect their mindset. Rapists exist everywhere in the world, just like criminals. It depends on how much safeguard the government and society can provide people generally and women specifically.

                            Everyone is talking about treating the symptoms, not the cause.<br/>
The cause for many men having this mindset is that they were not raised to respect women. They saw so in their households. <br/>
If parents can't teach that, who can? I think the answer is schools- there should be government mandated gender equality classes taught in schools. Maybe the kids can go back home and teach their parents a few things.
