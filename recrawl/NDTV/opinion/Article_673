Headline::::Kejriwal Ad, The Aam Aurat, and the Strong Reactions



DateTime::::2015-06-24T14:07:00+05:30




                                The reaction to Arvind Kejriwal's television commercial-anger, disillusionment, mockery-is caused by overlapping but distinct provocations. It's useful to separate them to understand the vehemence of this reaction.
For those who haven't seen it, the commercial consists of a middle class housewife going about her chores, thinking about the ways in which Kejriwal's leadership has eased her household anxieties by reducing utility bills and ending petty corruption. In passing she waits on her couch-potato husband and rages against Kejriwal's critics especially the television talk shows that defame him.
Using government money to film and buy television time for party propaganda is the most glaring of these provocations. Newspaper reports suggested that a week's run on television could cost as much as Rs. 1.5 crore. Coming in the wake of a Supreme Court decision that disallowed photographs of politicians in government advertisements, the commercial seemed a deliberate attempt to flout the spirit of that judgment: it didn't actually 'picture' Kejriwal, but it made up for that by referring to him nearly a dozen times.
The Aam Aadmi Party / Delhi Government / Arvind Kejriwal might argue that publicising the good work done by a government is a legitimate use of public money and that the references to Kejriwal are reasonable given that he's the Chief  Minister. This is a bad argument on two counts. One, the Supreme Court clearly intended to discourage the personalisation of governance. Two, a populist government that daily argues that it is financially constrained shouldn't be wasting such money as it has on political puffery.
It'll be interesting to see if the Court decides to censure the government. In politics, as in much else, ethical standing depends on the ability to make sharp practice seem business as usual. If the Court looks the other way, Kejriwal and Sons (aka the AAP) will claim vindication for their stand that the commercial was no more than a DAVP advertisement in full motion.
While the outrage about taxpayer money being spent on boosting Kejriwal is justified, the related idea that the pictured housewife's Arvind worship is a political betrayal, is not. The argument that the AAP, having claimed to be different, is now revealed to be no more than a cult of personality, is unpersuasive. Arvind Kejriwal has always been the karta of both the Aam Aadmi Party and the movement out which it was born, India Against Corruption. Its strategic choices, its victories and defeats, its electoral standing and its political potential have always turned on his persona. Those who claim that the commercial has been an unpleasant revelation are either being strategically disingenuous or just haven't been paying attention.
The commercial is consistent with the AAP's political manifesto and its target constituency, Delhi's lower middle class, particularly its womenfolk. The AAP's ability to mobilise voters is based on its populist promise that it will improve their lives by bringing corrupt bureaucracies and corporations to heel; it isn't founded on a commitment to inner-party democracy or collective leadership. The reason these promises are believed is because Kejriwal's crusading, confrontational style, his maverick righteousness, his Everyman persona have made him a charismatic figure. The commercial harnesses that charisma and tries to set it to work. Why is that shocking?
The right-thinking critique of the commercial is a response to both its social content and its aesthetic values.
The commercial's social messaging has been widely condemned as regressive because it shows a woman doing all the household chores and waiting upon her husband while this stolid fellow does nothing apart from sit and watch television. AAP's gender credentials were already suspect given its all-male leadership and Lipika Mitra's allegations that her husband Somnath Bharti (earlier notorious for his midnight raid on Nigerian women in Khirki village) had physically abused her through their marriage. It must have been tempting to see the commercial's narrative as a poisonous plant growing organically out of the rich Ghaziabadi loam of the AAP's male chauvinism.
There is, however, an alternative reading possible. The housewife is this story's protagonist, its voice. She is not insurgent-she manages the household within the limitations of patriarchal authority-but she's politically engaged and impatient with her couch potato husband's willingness to be led by the nose by talk shows disparaging the Chief Minister.  He is a great lump with no speaking part, and if I were him, I'd be worried; going by the way his wife's eyes mist over, she fancies Kejriwal.
Is the AAP out of line when it argues that the household pictured in the commercial reflects 'social reality'? No. Not if the demographic it is aimed at receives it as a plausible scenario. The census tells us that just 10.6 percent of Delhi's women participate in the workforce. But isn't type-casting the housewife status quoist? Yes, but this is a political commercial, not an insurgent pamphlet. Shouldn't we expect better from a party that once supported the reading down of Section 377? Yes. It would have been fun if she had made the lauki she was peeling radioactive with mirch before feeding it to him, just to see him hiccup, but again, this is political propaganda, not a progressive skit. The suggestion that depicting the patriarchal household today presages the justification of worse things tomorrow-wife-beating, majoritarianism, global warming-is an extrapolation that might want to wait on events.
I suspect that one reason this commercial has got such a bad press is that its production values and style are straight out of Doordarshan's public service messages. There's a cardboard tackiness to it, a shameless obviousness that offends the commentariat's metropolitan sensibilities. My first reaction was annoyance: shouldn't a political commercial that has designs on me be better mounted and more obliquely made? It has since occurred to me that its success or failure mightn't turn on my reaction. Whether type-casting the aam aurat the way this commercial does is politically effective or not isn't going to be decided by you, me or the anglophone communion: it is a lowering but unavoidable fact that the Aam Aadmi Party has bigger fish to fry.Mukul Kesavan is a writer based in Delhi.

                            So much happening in whole of India, but media is concerned about insignificant Delhi and it's maverick leader Kejriwal. Please discuss more important topics. Whatever happened to SP leader who killed journalist ? What is happening with economy ? there are millions of these that need coverage. So stop writing 4-5 articles a day about Kejriwal.

                            Is this how AK behaves at home? Can we have an interview with AK's family to find out? The ad is perpetuating gender stereotypes and is a glaring misuse of public money. Plus the shoddy production values and the atrocious acting of the female protagonist. All in all, this ad has the potential to win back a few voters to the BJP side; sorry Mukul, congress is dead and there is nothing that can make it come alive in this country.

                            This advertisement is very 'funny' and seems their creative team have not applied their mind properly..!<br/><br/>
Now woman whose house electricity bills come as Rs.3000 (again with 50% subsidy...means that house was using electricity of Rs.6000 per month..!) and she didn't has money to buy vegetables..? And she was very happy on saving of Rs.3000 which would solve her all problems of foods, transportation, kids' education..! <br/><br/>
Doesn't it looks completely funny - when house can afford to use electricity of Rs.6000 per month (without 50% subsidy) but can't spend money of Rs.30 (per day means 900 per month..!) on vegetables..!

                            Point here is...Why only Kejriwal, Arvind names in the ad? Why she's talking about bijli pani, when everyone knows it was just a hoax and no truth to it? 6% increase in bijli. AAP was suppose to be different but they are just comparing with other parties like a small kids. Worst is yet to come..

                            I see the commercial of AAP as a cheap tactic of fooling public and perhaps it is Ashutosh genius brain behind the scenes.<br/><br/>
Once, I have been confidant that what Dr Jayaprakash Narayan could not do in AP but AAP can do in Delhi that is cleaning corruption. However, with the entry of Ashutosh in AAP it has weakened and with the exit of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan I feel it was shaken.<br/><br/>
Arivind Kejriwal demonstrated a like a fool when he got elected 1st time and the second time he is acting like an idiot. One mistake is fine but two mistakes then rest is history of AAP.

                            Is there any accountant in the world who can show the statement of quantified amount of money claimed in the add saved by the corruption that used for the freebies ? The frequency of this useless add in which Not even calling CM or Delhi government but Arvind is there everywhere &amp; not any other message or any declaration of public announcement or public awareness like we see for example - Sakharta Abhyan or Puls Polio etc in which in past Other Parties also tried to score points but we saw parties names once or twice or CM scheme or PM scheme like this but in this add using Public money Kejriwal &amp; the group is abusing the mandate . Absolutely rubbish. It's time to throw them in the bin. Once we file case against Shivsena in the Mumbai &amp; force the party to pay for such expenditure. Someone in Delhi needs to appeal in the court. Remember looking at the frequency of the advertise must have cost more than 3 crore  until now. Couple of week before the same ARVIND was not paying salary of SAFAI WORAKERS. WAKE UP DELHI.

I would like to know from him how many time has he cooked food in his house or the other commenting on the same, How much has been spent in last one month on AD for Yoga day does any one know, Has the black money brought back , has the corruption ended at center with an example of ED evador been helped by Union Ministers.<br/>
Has MCD been able to generate the revenue verses the dummy work force they have, Why centre is not asking DERC not to increase the power prices, Is is that KJ has not doen any ggo0d job in last 3 months , what are the achievents of Cong in last 65 years and o BJP in last one year, all is expected from KJ in 90 days , Pity on the thinking of narrow minded peiple who ok with 365 days no work but 90 day worried.

Sometime I think the people who post comments here supporting BJP/Congress and oppose AAP, are they real representation of indian people or some virtually hired by parties to post in favour of BJP/Congress.

                            I quite like this piece. But I also believe that Kejri has had to take this deperate measure, (tacky goes with it) to counter the bad press he's getting and the great work he is doing that is going unnoticed. Also, it is quite ridiculous to expect progressive gender politics here when the party that AAP is going against is basically gender regressive to a horrifying extent, communal, corrupt to boot (anyone doing enron the first year in power..remember?)and a Hitler fan. You have a bigger monster to deal with if this guy goes down because you can't hold your outrage. Anyway, I do think people should express what is wrong, but don't yet write him off. Where are you when he does the good work?

                            Kejriwal's actions and governance are getting restricted to purposeful defamation of BJP. This is not what we wanted. That's not what we voted for. <br/><br/>
AK is disappointing us day by day with his madness against BJP. And this is deeply hurting people of Delhi and their development. <br/>
Compared to any other city / state in India, Delhi has everything - from infrastructure to financial resources. <br/><br/>
It's now upto the sheer will of the chosen government to either make it India's first smart city OR the first political battle city of India.
