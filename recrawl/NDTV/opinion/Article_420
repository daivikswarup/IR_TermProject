Headline::::AAP and its Anarchy



DateTime::::2015-02-17T04:09:00+05:30



(Critical theorist and writer Rukmini Bhaya Nair is a professor at IIT Delhi. She is the author of several academic books, three volumes of poetry and a novel recently long-listed for the DSC Prize.)
	 
	Noam Chomsky is one of the great public intellectuals of our times. No wild demagogue but an MIT professor who has shaped world thought over the past half century and made key phrases such as "the manufacture of consent" and "the new mandarins" part of common political vocabulary, he yet espouses an 'anarchist' perspective. What does he mean by this?
	 
	As the fledging AAP takes office after its recent stunning electoral victory, I suggest it could have something vital to learn from Professor Chomsky's interpretation of anarchism. Even more crucially, all of us beleaguered citizens of India and denizens of Delhi, who have so blithely been invited to become Chief Ministers alongside Mr. Kejriwal, could also perhaps benefit from Chomsky's thoughts on why 'anarchy' might matter for democracies today. AAP, after all, is an avowedly anti-establishment party that finds itself voted in with an absolute majority. Therefore, a central question thrown up by its 'new politics' has to be: how can a spirit of robust dissent be nurtured by those in charge of a hierarchical, rule-bound and powerfully entrenched system of government?
	 
	The gloss on 'anarchism' that Noam Chomsky provides helps address this foundational question.  As he sees it, a chief attraction of anarchist doctrine is that it fractures power. Its essence lies in multiplicity.  In his scholarly introduction to Daniel Guerin's Anarchism: From Theory to Practice (1987), Chomsky maintains that there have been "many styles of thought and action that have been referred to as 'anarchist'". He also presents us with a wonderfully evocative description of anarchism: "A French writer, sympathetic to anarchism, wrote in the 1890s that 'anarchism has a broad back, like paper it endures anything.'"
	 
	It is this quality of 'endurance', the 'broad-back' of anarchism as a 'style of thought and action' that could offer, in my view, a common person's guide to understanding why 'anarchy' could be a useful concept in the evolution of democracy today.  For, when a concept 'endures' across time and is capacious enough to embrace enormous multiplicity, it maybe should not be lightly tossed away once it has served a limited purpose. As Bhartrhari, the independent-minded Sanskrit grammarian, put it in another context enam nana rupam atmani sannivistam (roughly translated, the atman or singular self is settled deep within a multiform world) Thus, especially in a plural society such as ours, 'anarchism'  cannot be dismissed simply as a synonym for idiosyncratic behaviour. Rather, it could be retained as a key conceptual item in democratic spaces, interestingly signifying both a dangerous volatility as well as what the Russian anarchist Bakunin called our inalienable "instinct for freedom".   
	 
	Track the word 'anarchy' from its early Greek beginnings (an-arkhos, meaning 'without a ruler') and it is apparent that it embodies a deep psychological tension between our need as individuals to be free, and the necessity for force to be exercised by governments that curtail our individual freedoms where there is a disruption of 'law and order'. Anarchy is thus a 'swing-voter' word in mediating the social contract and is interesting for this reason. True, its connotations have mainly been negative; it has repeatedly been associated with chaos, with insurrections and with riots. Yet philosophers from Hobbes to Kant have paid the concept serious attention, while Proudhon attempted to constructively build anarchism into a political movement based on 'voluntarism' - a move that resonates with AAP's recent Delhi campaign.
	 
	Consider the following real-world Indian scenario from last week: a sudden flash-mob of AAP youth breaks out into an energetic 'Jai Ho' dance in Vikram Chandra's cool, well-appointed, technologically snazzy NDTV studio. Then Prashant Bhushan steps in, describing in measured tones the difficult problems of articulation and implementation that AAP will face in the next five years. The atmosphere in the studio sobers down. But how does one reconcile these two opposed faces of political action, these wholly divergent modes of self-representation? It is here that the notion of 'anarchic spaces' is useful.  
	 
	Anarchic space is critical in a modern democracy because its hallmark is contestation. Veering unpredictably between talk and action, chaos and freedom; dullness and impatience; legitimate self-interest and corrupt dealings; human capital and corporate capital; community participation and individual abstraction; affect and effect; indifference and hope, anarchic space offers a voice-box, a collective larynx. Whether on social media, in print or everyday talk, it promotes what Chomsky calls "adversarial culture" and Amartya Sen dubs "argument".
	 
	Censorship issues belong centrally to this space. Irreverence and insult are its staples. In these politically correct times, such anarchic apertures for civic discourses must be strongly protected, for it is there that the uncomfortable questions will be asked, for example, about why exactly gender matters or what differences exist, if any, between hate-speech and the hallowed literary liberty to 'speak up'.
	 
	John Kenneth Galbraith, an American 'friend of India' in an era much before President Obama and Michelle visited us, tells us in an  2001 Outlook interview that he invoked the idea of anarchy because he "wanted to emphasise the point...that the success of India did not depend on the government [italics mine]. It depended on the energy, ingenuity and....the wonderful adaptability and initiative of Indians that extends all the way from a village in Uttar Pradesh to a suburb in New York." Involved in the setting up of IIT Kanpur, Galbraith then declared that the "students that were brought there were part of my hope."
	 
	Some of the qualities identified by Galbraith with such astuteness ages ago have visibly come to the fore in the young, aspiring India of today. But it is the word "hope" that is crucial to his explanation - a word that Chomsky also sees as central. Chomsky, too, "would like to believe that people want to control their own affairs, they don't want to be pushed around, ordered, oppressed, etc. They want a chance to do things that make sense, like constructive work...It's really a hope about what human beings are like, a hope that if social structures change sufficiently, those aspects of human nature will be realized."  
	 
	Far-reaching changes in India's 'social structures' seem to have been set in motion today, both at the state and national levels. But what effect will these changes have on the structure of our feelings, those inchoate but potent hopes and desires that are by their very nature 'anarchic'?  Well, RK Laxman's beloved cartoons of 'the common man' once sardonically showed him at the venal mercy of officials and politicians. Now the common man is himself the politician.
	 
	It is this supreme but happy irony that all varieties of political thought in India must confront. What sort of future will the common man as politician envision for his society?Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            It is said that the Govt of the day is a true reflection of the people's mindset. Delhi deserves the Govt of the day. 75% of the people residing in delhi are outside settlers. they would like to extract all freebies from the govt they choose. AAP was so desperate to come to power that it rained freebies offer to people without understanding how would it be implemented with the limited funds the govt has. Now the 25% delhites would also have to suffer. Thankyou democracy. That is why people have to be educated first. just by getting a degree does not mean you are educated. See the youth enmass voting for AAP. It is their immaturity and lack of experience that is now coming to the fore.

                            We love VIP rioteers and murderers and love to vote for them . How dare we vote for a common man. We should fight and make an issue even if a common man raises his voice for his basic needs . WE are VIP and only we have the right to rule over the common man. Its so easy to show him dreams of acche din but those acche din were for VIPs not for the hapless people who voted for the VIPs.

                            Given 4600 Indian farmers committing suicide every hundred days for last few decades irrespective of whichever constitutional government(NaMo/MMS),has been censoring India's anarchic sensory tinglings, this metro-sexual Chomsky/Sen balms and fidgeting sweeteners are no key to retribution for those humongous "five lakhs crore rupees" of tax freebies written off to corporate (1% of population) each year. India's definition of anarchy has to emerge from within its intermittent struggle against harshly increasing inequality on the ground. This Bharatiya anarchy will have an ideal fallout from Bakunin's theorizing lip-conundrum once this struggle turns truly pervasive even among the middle classes. It is a class that keeps on earning the notoriety of an egotistical hegemony on social passiveness. For now a warm second hand Muffler from Delhi footpath, indeed helps protecting the lower middle class from that biting authoritarian cold and the chilling lack of human compassion rampant just one step above their social ladder ..

Wait and see the style of governance and how he and his team are going to implement it in an acceptable manner to all.  Dont cry within 5 days.  Now he is not a BHAGODA, as some of you think.   If you are so concerned about state money, people, you did not cry when lakhs of crores of this country looted.  96% of Delhi voted for him.  It is between him and them.  Stay out!

                            AAP must have some plan for reducing water and electricity tarrif , even they need to subsidized power and water, they can do so as it is less then 5% of Delhi's budget or they may increase tarrif for higher brackets. All other states are doing same thing like distributing free laptops and TV , they havent made such offer but concentrate on minimum Bijli, sadak paani .

                            The fact that Noam Chomsky "shaped" world thought is only a illusion for those who involve themselves in intellectual activity a lot, without action. His on the ground effect on the world is doubtful at best.<br/><br/>
When I was at student at MIT, I came away from one of his talks with a feeling that he is putting forth his thoughts - radical at times alright - but not helping radically making a change in the world. Also, too much intellectual rigor in an article, like this one, remains just that - intellectual, good for PhD and publications.<br/><br/>
What happens with that is that one loses to bring forth the charm and lightness in life and the smile it brings to oneself and others - much more important than the Chomskyan gymnastics.

                            Dear Ms. Nair, I am glad to see that there is someone sensible who understands what AAP is trying to do and where the crowd of Delhi has vested their vote in. It would be interesting to see the ruling party in Delhi come up with different kind of reasons not to fulfill their promises. While i hope they do provide good governance, but at the end of the day its a game of Old Promises in a new language. A language which the youngsters of Delhi perceive as language of change and revolutionist. If there is a good work to describe the party, i think it is opportunist.

                            I have opted out of the LPG subsidy. Let all the IT payers opt out and allow the subsidy to go to needy. It is the culture of most of the educated delhites to grab free even though they really are in need of this. Let all these people be true to their self and honest and come out of the freebies offered by the government.

                            Corruption is wrong and crony capitalism is wrong but to replace it with freebie capitalism is also wrong. Two wrongs cannot make a right. People must have to pay for resources like power and water. People have to be accountable. Giving everything free, then encouraging squatters by banning demolitions etc is a beginning of the end. Controlling corruption will take a long time in the meanwhile the govt will be bankrupt

                            @: There are two different subsidies that Kejriwal has supported:<br/><br/>
1. One is for lifeline water i.e. the amount of water recommended by the WHO for an individual's daily needs. The AAP Govt will be providing 700L of lifeline water to everyone in Delhi free of cost since they consider it is the government's responsbility to do so. This would cost the govt about $55 million annually. Delhi's annual budget is $6.5bn. The subsidy amounts to 0.84% of Delhi's annual budget. Clearly, this small amount of subsidy is justified. In addition, anyone using more than 700L of water will be charged for the complete usage. For the long term measures, AAP has laid out an elaborate plan to replenish Delhi's declining underground water table. This measures include cleaning up the Yamuna river and storing it's water in small dams for distribution during the summer. The water collected from Yamuna can meet all of Delhi's water needs for 100 days. Further long-term measures include rain water harvesting, etc.<br/><br/>
2. The second subsidy is on power/electricity. It has been clearly stated that this is a temporary subsidy which would be revoked once the CAG audit of Delhi's power discoms has been completed. It is expected that the audit would reveal several irregularites in the discom books and the power rates would automatically decrease without a subsidy. The cost of this subsidy is around $210m which is about 3.25% of Delhi's <br/>
annual budget. Long-term measures include wide-scale harvesting of solar energy and constructing a local power plant if required.

                            To be an anarchist is an honourable course of action to take when fighting against entrenched oppression and injustice. Only those who want to protect their vested interests give it a bad name by equating it with chaos. But history is replete with anarchist heroes. Lord Krishna was an anarchist to persuade Arjuna to fight against his own kith and kin. In the eyes of the British, Netaji and Bhagat singh and thousands our freedom fighters were anarchists. For the white racists, Martin Luther King was an anarchist. The Chinese ruling clique call His Holiness the Dalai Lama an anarchist. And now we have a new "anarchist" championing the cause of the Common Man, fighting against corruption and rising above caste and class politics of the more powerful political parties.

                            Rukmini Bhaya Nair has made the same mistake of seeing through a jaundiced eye. The definition of anarchy as per her understanding may be suitable for developed nations with almost nil corruption. In India the corrupt political parties with great qualities of dishonesty and cunningness loot tax payer's money with full discipline. That suits Ms Rukmini's definition of well-disciplined governance. She may be intellectual but she has no idea and knowledge of the lives of poor, downtrodden people of Delhi neither she knows the cunning methods of generating corrupt money by political parties in India. Thus her opinion is good for nothing to millions of Delhi voters.

                            What a load of incomprehensible verbiage ! The phrase "beating around the bush" is surely given a new dimension by the author - ranging as she does from Galbraith to grammarians of Sanskrit ! The average voter of Delhi cares two hoots about Chomsky, Hobbes, Kant and their ilk - IIT professors included. He probably would be unable to define anarchy using the esoteric terms used by our beloved professor. But for sure, he knows that he lives in anarchy when he is held hostage by the bribe seeking policeman, the VAT officer and every other sundry babu in a government office; he knows he lives in anarchy when his living conditions are just a shade better than those of a failed state such as Somalia; and he knows that it is anarchy when politicians from parties such as the Congress &amp; the BJP enrich themselves at his expense. Kejriwal tries to understand his plight and that in itself is a good beginning for Indian politics. But dear Professor, thank you anyway for your Post mortem !

                            The problem is inherent. The common man will expect rule of Law and a fair degree of equality which may not always be complimentary but could well be conflicting at times. If AAP allows demolition of unauthorized colonies, it may fail the test of equality some may argue that action against black money /illegal businesses must take precedence over the colonies where people struggle for life. But if it stops demolitions it will obviously fail the test of rule of Law. Therefore, in public policies, the outcomes will always be negotiated and hence sub optimal not the 100% efficient one. The only question is how much higher efficiency is achieved. AAP should better keep this in mind going forward.
