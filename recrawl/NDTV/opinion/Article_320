Headline::::Modi Wave? Modi Magic? Where is it?



DateTime::::2014-12-23T19:11:00+05:30




                                (Pawan Khera is a political analyst with the Congress party.) The echo of the voters' voice of May 2014 is fainter and receding as proven by the assembly elections in Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir. When you compare the Lok Sabha results to today's, the BJP has little to rejoice. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had won 60 of the 81 Assembly segments of Jharkhand. It is now struggling to reach the half-way mark. What appeared to be the BJP's Spring Moment of May 2014 has turned into a frozen winter.The BJP's campaign in Jammu and Kashmir was divisive and confused. From tying up with former separatist Sajjad Lone to talking about a Hindu Chief Minister, from Ram Madhav's unwavering stand on abrogating Article 370 to Hina Bhat's threat of taking to the gun if Article 370 was disturbed, both the good and the bad cops of BJP took their roles rather seriously with contradictory stands on key issues.The rejection of the BJP including that of Hina Bhat in the Valley shows that the BJP's polarizing influence is not just perceived, it is there. Had the BJP won a single seat in the Valley, Dr Jekyll could have celebrated. The Congress winning seats in all three regions of the state proves again that it is the only truly national party. The party seems to be retaining 13 of its 17 seats. Those who are surprised that the Congress has borne no impact of Afzal Guru's hanging which happened under the UPA regime need to have a better understanding of the people of Kashmir - an understanding not tainted by radical elements on both sides of the border. Despite references to Article 370, conversions, a Hindu Chief Minister, and above all the so called Modi-magic and Amit Shah's management skills, the BJP failed to sweep the Jammu region, which was low-hanging fruit given the Hindu majority.BJP's Mission 44, apart from being a legit ambition to form a government in the state, also had a sub-text and the sub-text was this was its first bid at seeking the Muslim vote. In the middle of an election in this crucial state, Sadhvi Niranjan made her derogatory remarks about religious minorities and the RSS raised the pitch on conversions. Narendra Modi remained ambivalent on the Sadhvi and silent on conversions. Where was the earnestness for Mission 44? Was the BJP actually confused in its strategy on J&K? Was it deliberately speaking in two voices? Was it just consolidating its votes in the Jammu region? The process of government formation will throw up many interesting formulations and compromises. It will also pave the way for the future political culture of this crucial border state. The result throws up a unique possibility of non-BJP parties coming together to find a common ground and common agenda for this sensitive state. If the PDP decides to partner with the BJP to form the government, what would be the stand on contentious issues like Article 370, Self-Rule, dual currency and AFSPA? If the BJP dilutes its stand on any of these issues, apart from being another U-turn, it would also compromise the constituency that voted for the BJP precisely for its stand on these issues. The PDP's manifesto mentions Self- Rule. While the PDP can be ambivalent on the definition of self-rule and its stand on dual currency, the BJP can neither afford to be soft on the PDP's agenda nor on its own. In Jharkhand, the experiment of the newly reunited Janata Pariwar may not have really taken off and the BJP's 'half a victory' is by default. In terms of numbers, the regional JMM has beaten anti-incumbency and shown that if the party was a part of the larger alliance, the BJP would have found it difficult to form the government. The Prime Minister campaigned hard in these Assembly elections. Like a gambler who stakes all winnings for further gains, Narendra Modi appears to be using up his political capital in election campaigns rather than in governance. In fact, he is facing a lot of flak for his absence from the Parliament on this account. He should be depressed at neither being able to get crucial Bills passed in the Parliament nor succeeding in getting an absolute majority in Jharkhand or getting a reason to smile in Kashmir.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

BJP has won so many seats! (Why could not Congress become the second largest party that too after governing the country for 60 years? It is because Modi wave....

                            Surprised to see that even today there people who belive that Congress is doing well. Congress badly need these people, they can actually consider giving the writer a ticket in the next election...all the best to them.<br/>
Surprised that when Sonia Gandhi ask the Imam "to ask Muslims in this country to vote for Congress", these writers do not lecture on secluralism....when the Xavier principal ask people not to support or vote for BJP, there is no issue on secularism. we have one sided secluarism in India.<br/>
Anyway the people of this country are giving a mandate to Modi &amp; BJP, it does not matter what writers siting in glass cabins think

                            You should analyze your own party first, consistently going down the stairs. I mean any person with his common sense will rescue his own house first instead of commenting on neighbors. everywhere you are going in minus. Then too you have time to write this much big column about other party. May be you are right about BJP, i can't say, but your first duty should be to work on your own party.

                            If the fringe elements RSS and VHP stop their mad rant about Hindutva the Modi wave of development could have seen J&amp;K give at least 30 plus seat and in Jharkhand they would have touched 50 plus.  Lesson for BJP talk and do only development and stop this nonsense of Hindutva and spend their energy in cleanliness and hygiene in India and drug free India. Modi is a visionary but he has taken the support of RSS that does not know anything beyond Hindutva.

                            Modi has already reached the peaks of a victories of mountain.  No further climbing.  Only downfall will starts... already started.  NDA led by Modi is a huge baloon.  Now it is losing steam.  Modi Government will fall within a year.  Again UPA will form Government with thumping majority.  Other than congress, no political party is  able to lead this country.  This is not my personal statement. Voters proved this time and again.  In the present trend no one is happy with Modi Government, inluding some senior MPs from BJP itself. This is irrefutable fact.

                            some people are now jealous with the election verdicts of Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Jharkhand. So Mr.khera please accept the people opinion. If there is no Modi effect then how is it possible for BJP to clean sweep in Jharkhand and became the second largest party in Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Perhaps you are unable to see the Modi Wave starting from starting from general election to recently concluded state elections.

                            Dear Writer,<br/><br/>
Very good article...good for nothing though. Have you ever written the effect of Kashmiri Pandit's and Army soldiers killing in Kashmir and blamed Congress and National conference governments the way you are comparing the conversion and Sadhvi Niranjan remarks issue with BJP. Shame on you and similar type of Media, when Hindus get converted no problem, when they get killed no problem but when you need to blame Hindu's persons like you are front runners.

where any body accepts or not Indian people donot believe in devisive politics. PDP and BJP coming together will not fullfill the aspirations of people who voted them, only to stop the other coming to power

                            It is a pity that the Author forgets the huge difference between LS and State Polls, which was contested on local issues. Moreover, in a multi cornered contest winning a comfortable majority is not an easy task, and comparing the poll percentage or constituencies the and now are irrelevant. The main aim of Modiji is to fill the RS with BJP majority Strength, as and when the Opposition members  retires, and he is succeeding in his goal one after another. Winning all but one Constituency in Jammu Region  is a clever strategy of BJP, to capture power in J&amp;K, which the author may have put out in his article.

                            Dear readers. Though he is a congress analyst, one has to read his article without prejudice and emotion which otherwise will mask the truth for you. for example he has mentioned that in  2014 loksabha  BJP had won 60 segments out of 80. Now that has comedown in assembly election. It is indeed an eye opener for BJP to understand why this decline within 6 months. Possibly, people voted for developments but now hardliners implement hindutva agenda which indians have denied for last 10 years by electing congress against BJP. So if you like modi as development agent then be against hardliners agenda and only support development agenda so that India will flourish as a developed nation with secular credential like the developed world. Otherwise india will be sidelined by them for being intolerant and no investors would put their money at risk.
