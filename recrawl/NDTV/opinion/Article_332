Headline::::Coping With A New World Disorder In 2014



DateTime::::2014-12-29T19:58:00+05:30




                                (Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 14 books, including, most recently, Pax Indica: India and the World of the 21st Century.)The year that has gone by paints a troubling picture of what, for lack of a better phrase, we can call the new world disorder. Take a random set of headlines from 2014 and what do we see? The world media was dominated by coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict in Gaza, the rise of ISIS and the horrors they are perpetrating in Syria and Iraq, the events between Russia and Ukraine and the shooting down of a Malaysian civilian airliner in the latter, and, most recently, the savage killing of 145 innocents, including 133 children, at a school in Peshawar by terrorists of the Pakistani Taliban.If we wanted to move away from military conflict, we come across different signs of disorder: the spread of the deadly Ebola virus, with an accompanying sense of panic and the virtual quarantine of many countries in West Africa; mounting inequality within and between societies; the creation of a BRICS bank in reaction to the failure of the Bretton Woods Institutions (the World Bank and the IMF) to produce a more equitable global economic system; a fragile patch-up of the Doha round of world trade talks and the Lima conference on climate change, both with consensus hanging by a thread; and a sense of disunity among the Great Powers, as the G-8 goes back to being a G-7. Not to mention the disappearance of two civilian aircraft from Malaysia in still-unexplained circumstances mid-flight.All these events transcend national boundaries with implications for the globe as a whole, but with no common agreed global mechanism to deal with them other than the UN and its agencies with all their limitations. Meanwhile, the UN's Millennium Development Goals reach their target date of 2015 largely unfulfilled in most of the developing world.And yet it is not all bad news. Among the major global trends of 2014 was the growing spread of communication through the Internet. Some 600 million more people got online this year, taking the figure to 2.9 billion of the planet's 7 billion inhabitants using the Internet. Increasingly, people are accessing the Internet with their mobile phones. As connections in our country get cheaper and faster, Indians will be far more globally connected than ever before.Another trend that continued from recent years was the increasing growth and economic power of China, just a generation ago a poor developing country whose GDP was the same as India's. A regimented polity and an export-driven economy has taken China to the point where, in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms, it overtook the US in 2014 to become the largest economy in the world. Of course, in strict dollar terms the US, at $17.4 trillion, is still far ahead of China at $10.4 trillion (India is tenth in nominal terms at under $3 trillion but third in PP ranking.) But by current growth standards, China is likely to overtake the US in the conventional measurement as well by the mid-2020s. The world order is changing irreversibly.And most recently, the price of oil has been plummeting faster than it rose in the last couple of years, from $128 a barrel when elections were called in India to around $60 today. This - the result of a price war between traditional producers in OPEC and the new producers of expensive shale oil in North America -- has been good news for those countries which are largely dependent on imported energy, like India, and less good for those who export oil.So what does that leave us with? As 2014 ends, we see a messy world, with some hopeful auguries for our own development. New Delhi will have to be attentive and diplomatically agile to cope with the extension of these trends in the New Year.The NDA government's emphasis on good relations with our neighbours is important, since restive borders will only distract us from our domestic priorities, and the foreign investors so assiduously courted by Prime Minister Modi will not come to a potential war-zone. At the same time it is important for India to develop key relations with the Great Powers, our equivalent of what the Chinese call their "major-country diplomacy". It is good that the first few months of the Modi government have featured useful meetings with all the top world leaders. The challenge is to ensure that these go beyond photo-ops designed to enhance the PM's acceptability to his new peers and become tangible platforms for a positive new evolution in issues of vital interest to us.There are challenges ahead for us in all our vital relationships. On the subcontinent: to neutralize the threat of terror from Pakistan, to make progress on the intractable border issue with China, to continue strengthening our vastly improved relations with Bangladesh, to ensure Nepal does not erupt again, to play our part in keeping Sri Lanka and the Maldives closer to us than to the expanding Chinese sphere of influence that has reached out to them, and to remain closely attentive to the security and development needs of Afghanistan post the withdrawal of the Western forces there.In the wider world: to start winning tangible economic benefits from countries like the US and Japan, where the feel-good atmospherics have often outstripped the concrete deliverables; to improve relations with a growing Africa, which is feeling snubbed by our decision to cancel this year's India-Africa Summit in the wake of the Ebola virus scare; to maintain the cordiality of our relations with Europe, including the UK, while deepening links to specific major European countries, notably Germany; and to expand our circle of friends, from Australia to Zambia, who feel that India's success is in their national interest too.Finally, to play the internationalist role we have long played on issues of the global commons, taking in trade and climate change while ranging from cyber-space to outer space, protecting our own interests while leading the world in the direction of constructive change.All this calls for skillful diplomacy led by a focused and attentive political leadership, monitored by a vigilant and well-informed citizenry. Yes, dear reader: you have a role too. This is your world, and you have as much stake as Mr Modi does in ensuring that we don't collectively fail to cope with it.Happy New Year to all!Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the

                            As we look back at 2014 ,a lot many issues come before us.India's health care infrastructure is in a bad shape.Thousands of underprivileged people across the country do not have any access to these facilities.On the other hand ,incidents like botched up surgeries in Chhatisgarh and cataract operations ' failure in Punjab have further fractured this system.  Unemployment ,absence of educational facilities to economically weaker section of the society,increase in crime rate etc are some of the issues continue plaguing our society.Let these vital matters be addressed to some extent in 2015.

                            Can I point out more pressing issues for India?  Is the quality of air going to fall below livable standards in the majority of the Indian cities?  Expect exponential growth in greenhouse gas emissions from the rising number of personal vehicles.  The area of land that will produce grain is due to decrease very significantly.  This is because Andhra Pradesh is allocating agricultural land in the fertile coastal region for 'development' purposes.  The Swachh Bharat program has not stopped open defecation in villages and slums. This will only intensify as the so called poor, will give priority to buy electronic gadgets like mobile phones instead of toilets.  Water resources will be increasingly under pressure from consumption needs and pollution.  On the positive side, corruption could go down by a notch.  Inflation and unemployment could be eased.  Communal harmony could be better.  The time to act on our problems is now. <br/><br/>
I have stopped using my car on a regular basis. Even though dirty and crowded, I am using public transport like bmtc buses.  At home my children use water very sparingly. I have paid my taxes.  We avoid plastic. Any more suggestions what I should do to help?

                            Above all, lets pray, we could live in a world, Where we can breath fresh air, Where we grow more green, Where people respect each other for their faiths, their ideologies and their self respect, Where we learn to care for people who are elder to us, Where our children respect us for all our good deeds, Where we can assure the new generation for all the peace they deserve, Where we can together convert this disorder into an order which we all enjoy. Let's pray that our politicians are given good overall health to lead 'US' (not just themselves) from the front. A very prosperous, peaceful and happy new year to all.

                            excellent one Shashi !!! May your tribe increase.Hope india gets educated before we spread our influence or bring value to the table. But this mass of carefully cultivated ignorance is hard to change. Everyone knows it's politically incorrect to speak the truth in India. Our national motto should be " Ali baba , 40 thieves- where robbery and ignorance is the law" . What truth alone triumphs ? Is there anyone in India who lives by or even believes in utter truth. No. So we will have decadence. May 2015 bring in the year of the Siva where everything untrue including democracy is brunt to ashes and a new Vedic age begins which is not bound by the past nor is limited by the present, but creates what's new and true. Amen. Lord it's a miracle :-)
