Headline::::Road Signs With Muslims' Names Defaced, No Action Follows



DateTime::::2015-05-20T04:51:00+05:30




                                One of the most popular quotes from Shakespeare is "What's in a name? A rose by any name would smell as sweet..." The quote is usually made to re-inforce an argument that a 'name' really has no meaning or at least no connection with the character or attributes of the person or object or fruit, flower or animal that bears it. What is often forgotten by those using the quote is its context in Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet'. Romeo utters these words not to re-inforce any argument but in a cry of anguish.  
In our own country, anyone who thinks that there is nothing in a name is even more naive than Shakespeare's star-crossed teen lovers. In India, a name is a marker of identity - regional, caste and religious. It has to be revealed in its entirety before two strangers, even when they share something as transient as a train or bus journey, can decide on the contours and limits of a relationship. Here, a name reveals more than it conceals and determines the nature of the bearer more than his or her IQ, looks, character and aptitude. Try telling a Khap panchayat or even many Indian families across communities "What's in a name?" It would leave them aghast. And if the question was asked by an errant daughter announcing her attachment to a young man from another community, it could lead to anything from incarceration, torture, forced marriage or, even, death.
It is not surprising, therefore, that some Hindutva organizations went about celebrating One Year of the Modi Government in the way that they did. They painted over in black signs for Delhi roads that are named after Muslims. Officials of the New Delhi Municipal Corporation told reporters on May 16 that "Signages of Safdar Hashmi Marg, Feroz Shah Road, Aurangzeb Road and Akbar Road were blackened...We have lodged an FIR for defacement of property."  
The FIR was lodged without mentioning any names despite the fact that posters were pasted on the defaced signboards stating that 'Bharat mein Islamikaran manzoor nahi. Safar mein mushkilen aaye himmat aur badti hai. Koi agar raasta roke toh zaroorat aur bhadti hai. Jai Hind! Jai Bharat! (Islamisation will not be tolerated in India. Our courage only grows when our journey meets difficulties. Our need only grows when our path meets with obstacles)'. Given below were the names of office-bearers of the organization responsible for this act of vandalism, the Shiv Sena Hindustan.
Votaries of Hindutva claim to believe in real 'secularism'. They remind us repeatedly that they are not opposed to Muslims as such. Muslims who accept their Hindu origins are treated by them as equal fellow citizens. Muslims who respect Hindu culture and traditions are also completely acceptable. It is only Muslims who are fanatics and have been responsible for atrocities committed on Hindus who are to be deemed anti-national.
It is interesting, then, to take a second look at the four names defaced. The first is that of Safdar Hashmi, an atheistic Communist artist of many talents - theatre person, actor, poet, writer - who was killed by Congress goons while performing for a working-class audience as part of a campaign for a strike action. He could have saved his own skin but he stopped to defend a worker who was also being attacked. As a result, they were both brutally murdered. According to Safdar's wishes, he was cremated.  
The second name is that of Feroz Shah, founder of the Tughlaq dynasty. The third is Akbar, the great Mughal emperor, whose love of knowledge and eclecticism led to his being declared a heretic by several influential Muslim clerics. He was responsible for preserving thousands of manuscripts in Sanskrit and Pali and also arranging for their translation into Persian. The fourth name is that of Aurangzeb who is, of course, a particular object of Hindutva venom.
It is important to understand the mindset behind this act of vandalism. The choice of signage that was defaced makes it abundantly clear that all Muslims are the enemy. Their names are enough to proclaim them as such.
The Delhi Police comes under the jurisdiction of the Home Ministry of the Government of India. No instructions have been given by the Home Ministry to the Delhi Police to take action in the matter despite the fact that a crime has been committed by criminals who have flaunted the fact of their involvement.
How the Modi Government deals with this macabre celebration of its One Year in Office will reveal its own commitment to the Constitution of India.(Subhashini Ali is former MP, former Member of the National Commission for Women and Vice President of the All India Democratic Women's Association.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Ms Ali, What action has been taken by you a) for naming a road in Delhi after the mass murderer Aurangazeb? b) what action has been taken for the hundreds of temples which were attacked in the name of religion in the last 6 decades? c) what action has been taken by you and the 60 years of Congress rule on the murders which happened in the name of religion? d) what action has been taken by you and your party on making polygamy illegal and getting a uniform civil code - why should there be different laws based on religion?

                            Good to see that Ms. Ali is protesting against the effacement of names in New Delhi. A nagging doubt. Why didn't she protest when her party's alliance partner, the DMK effaced the names of Brahmin leaders in Tamil Nadu. Was it because hmm, brahmins are not a vote bank like Muslims.

Let police investigate and locate the culprits.But the Mrs Ali had no patience and lost no time to rush with a long article in the press looks like she and her party have become bereft of any idea or thought for taking up political ccauses.<br/>
Why not CPM Congress AAP and Socialists of UP/Bihar merge together and form a party named Secular Socialist Congress. This would usher India in two party democracy

                            A quick note of history: Akbar was not an Indian, he was merely the progeny of an Uzbek invader, and did not have a single drop of Indian blood. Beginning with his son, Salim/Jehangir, every subsequent Mughal emperor had a Hindu mother.

                            This act of defacing names of one specific community is not correct. An action is required and will be happy if the leaders fight for it. But should we keep adding any and every non entities like Shivsena Hindustan to BJP ? Who are they and what is their identity to represent the enmity towards one community? Why are we making them big? Unknowingly the Authors like above are doing that. Let her start an agitation against this task. We all will support. writing something to conclude one party as wrong doesnt help other than creating hatred.<br/>
In the same Govt there are incidents where a Hindu Women saved the Muslims from riots even risking her life. Hindus led the Procession of one Muslim festival in same Delhi to demonstrate the solidarity. why cant this Author give the credit to the new Govt to let such unusual events happening?

                            Having a Aurangzeb road is like having a road named after Hitler in Germany, let us get our history right Aurangzeb was a mass murderer and all Indians irrespective of their faith would agree, in fact Aurangzeb deeply lamented his evil actions days before his death and that has been recorded and not a figment of imagination. However, goons taking the law into their own hands whatever their cause has to be dealt with severely.

                            I think she has a point.<br/>
Hindutva forces should learn to separate various shades of Muslims.<br/>
Aurangzeb isn't the same as Dr. Kalam isn't the same as Akbar isn't the same as Salman Khan isn't the same as Jinnah isn't the same as Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed isn't the same as Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan isn't the same as ...<br/>
An easy rule of thumb could be, a tolerant, reasonable Muslim is usually heavily criticized by the protectors of Islam. <br/>
The only notable exception is Jinnah, about whom there is celebration on the other side of the border and silence on this side of protectors of Islam. And mind you, 20 years down, once Congress' spell of demonizing Jinnah will die down and Pakistan ceases to exist as a single nation, Jinnah may as well be respected as one of the founding fathers of South Asia (with terrible consequences of his actions, of course!)

Mam, please read Wikipedia (rather than NCERT books) to know about all 'Good Karmas' that Mr.Aurangzeb did to non-Muslims. Mr.Aurangzeb gets credit for the execution of Sambhaji Raje (son of Shivaji), Guru Teg Bahadur and also for destructing 60000 temples. This emperor is 'happily and respectfully' remembered in Maharashtra and Punjab for treating these 2 great people with 'great respect' and hence the 'venom'.

After so many years she hasnt found any "hoi polloi", proletarian issue to chirp up. This happen all over india... english boards are regularly defaced in many places (bangalore), buses have boards in local language only.. While Akbar did not deserve to be defaced, the same is not true about aurangzeb. Safdar hashmi is a good for nothing coomie and can be defaced. Feroz shah at least built the GT road (i hope iam right) and hence deserves no defacement. More dangerous than these idiots are the commie idiots like yechury (karat gooone) trying to redefine themselves a la RaGa and his ludicrous attempts to build up a vision of india.

                            Police will do their investigation and case will move ahead. What makes her think no action is being taken? Does she want daily updates on the case from cops to trust that action is being taken?<br/><br/>
Another article that's 100% rhetoric &amp; 0% facts.

                            The Government internally is run by the RSS and company,Modiji is incharge of only the External affairs,that is exactly the reason he has traveled to 18 countries in 12 months,Whether Rajnath Singh will act or not act is besides the point.

                            Are you an eye witness to this being done by the so called "Hindutva" agents? Could be someone else trying to discredit someone? Stop the false propoganda without any proof!
