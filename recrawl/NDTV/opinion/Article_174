Headline::::A Modi-Made Disaster Hits Nepal Hard



DateTime::::2015-12-07T21:52:00+05:30




                                "13 border guards detained". By Pakistan? China? Hell, no. By Nepal! That is the condition to which we have been reduced by Modi's neighbourhood policy.
 
One had fondly hoped that once the Bihar elections were over, and Modi's bid for the north Bihar vote via gross interference in Nepal's internal affairs had ended, there would be some respite for the beleaguered Nepalese. But, no, we are into the third month of India's siege of our landlocked neighbour and there is no sign of an end to the crisis. It seems there is something insatiable about Modi's thirst for vengeance on Nepal for being denied a Hindu Rashtra, and undermining his bid to speak at a rally in Janakpur a year ago with the intention of distributing 10,000 bicycles to Madhesi girls to impress their relatives across the border who were due to vote in the 2015 Bihar election. We are thus at the very nadir of our key strategic relationship with the single most important bordering country we have.
The Chinese have rushed to Nepal's succour and are laughing all their way across the Himalayas to Kathmandu - a mind-boggling diplomatic blunder. Suhasini Haider asks in The Hindu "It is necessary to ask one basic question: Why? Why has its (India's) diplomacy and power failed so miserably?" The Nepali Times of 5 December underlines that "Beijing obviously enjoys seeing India squirm in a quagmire of its own making." No anti-Indian Nepali (and their ranks have swelled to unprecedented levels in recent weeks) is going to forget or forgive the national humiliation heaped upon them by a bullying, domineering India. How does one explain to them that it is not India but Modi who is responsible for this tragedy?
UNICEF have estimated that three million Nepali children under the age of five are at risk of death or disease this winter if the Indian blockade continues. Anthony Lake, UNICEF's Executive Director said in a statement issued 30 November after visiting Nepal: "The risks of hypothermia and malnutrition, and the shortfall of life-saving medicines and vaccines, could be a potentially deadly combination for children this winter". What Bush did to Iraq pales in comparison to what India is doing to Nepal. This is not diplomatic retaliation; it amounts to abetment to genocide. And, worse, we are doing this just as Nepal is beginning to recover from its terrible earthquake. That was a natural disaster. This is entirely man-made. Or, at any rate, Modi-made.
The disaster being visited upon Nepal is of such a magnitude that the Nepalese have swallowed their pride and sent their deputy Prime Minister to New Delhi last week to plead the Nepali cause. Our government is tight-lipped about the outcome as the External Affairs Minister's statement in the Rajya Sabha on 4 December gave nothing away. But from speculation in the press, it appears Nepal has informed our authorities that it would work for a couple of constitutional amendments that would give a higher share of proportionate representation in the Nepalese parliament than is stipulated at the moment and adjust provincial boundaries to make them more ethnically cohesive. That is no achievement. The Nepal leaders, indeed the Nepal cabinet, had already been seized of this requirement and even drafted the amendments to concede additional space to the Terai voter. And this notwithstanding the fact that out of some 116 elected representatives of the Terai in Nepal's constituent assembly, only eleven had voted against the constitution. The other 105 had placed their trust in their upcountry Nepalese brethren to eventually give them a fair deal and do the truly patriotic thing of endowing Nepal with a constitution for which a consensus had been sought for over seven years. The moment was not to be lost.
Can you imagine a Nepali fetching up in New Delhi on 27 November 1949, the day after our constituent Assembly had adopted our constitution, to order us to not proclaim the constitution on 26 January 1950 because it would need 122 amendments over the next 65 years? Yet, that is exactly what happened when Modi rushed his Special Envoy to Kathmandu to order Nepal to desist. It was the equivalent of the 19th century imperial practice of sending gunboats up the Yangtze every time the Western colonialists in China were thwarted. And the figure of 122 that I have given is not fanciful. It is the number of the GST constitutional amendments that the Government is threatening to move in the Rajya Sabha in the coming week.
If our constitution can be amended over a hundred times without taking anything away from the essence of the  constitution - its "basic structure" - consider our gall in telling the Nepal constituent assembly that we do not trust them to keep their word (although over 100 elected Terai MPs do) and so, if they do not bend their knees to our insolent might, we will starve Nepal into submission by denying them food, medicine, cooking gas and other petroleum products? Yet, that is the magnitude of the suffering we have inflicted on lakhs of Nepalese who only wish to be left alone. Wickedest irony of all: this is how our country, pledged to the Five Principles of Panchsheel, disports itself under an anti-Nehruvian authoritarian. Shame on us!
 
Yubraj Ghimre, the Indian Express' dispassionate reporter on India-Nepal relations, has this to say: "The current standoff is only a manifestation of India not knowing when and where to stop, even when there were clear signs of India's role being counter-productive." On 6 December, he added in the same paper, "All of this appears to have generated a strong anti-India sentient among the younger generation, with the southern neighbour being painted as a villain".
Krishna Sinjali writes in The Nepali Times of "the bruised egos in the New Delhi establishment trying to teach Nepali politicians a lesson for not listening to them.'' Two days later, the same paper talked of "all the goodwill" generated by Modi's visit to Nepal having been "squandered by decision-makers in New Delhi who have callously turned an entire generation of Nepalis against India.'' Another Editor-in-Chief, Subhash Ghimire says, "The people see this as a big country in the south trying to bully us. The general population thinks we should stand up to India. People are together on this." Modi has succeeded in alienating an entire nation.
 
Our only hope is that most Nepalese understand that this is Modi's doing, not India's. As the voice of the Opposition rings out in parliament, let us hope the reverberations will reach the Valley of Kathmandu to show them that there is a huge section of India's public opinion that empathizes with their woes and stands ready to rectify matters when power is restored to Nepal's friends in India.

                            Although it would make me an alien subscribing to your views generally Mani, however having visited Nepal recently it is quite easy to see that Modi has created a daemon of himself in Nepal. Modi should learn from the UPA and work diplomatically with Nepal.

                            I have never liked Mani's 1-item agenda against Modi. It looks so sick on top. But if we leave out that part, the substance here in Mani's article is great. We did a major international blunder against Nepal. Nepal was a very close ally and a border cushion against the not-so-friendly China, but now it is gone.<br/><br/>
Very bad. We lost or almost verge of losing a strategic geographic partner.

                            Is there a single journalist of good standing, who can visit the supposed blockade areas and give us a ground reports about actually who is responsible for much talked about blockade. India is officially denying blockade charge. What is the reality? Is there a single journalist who is prepared to come our from his/her comfort zone and report directly from the conflict areas that is the alleged blockade sites? An authentic investigative journalist can set the records right.

One man from a assembly representing one of the largest democratic nation and one of the largest populated country speaks against a crisis which is inhuman and intolerable. Don't forget we Nepalese have safeguarded your nation for years and this is the third embargo as a gift to that. I and many Nepalese have nothing against the Indian people but take my words; don't send modi to Nepal next time. Pashupatinath won't be the same again.

Many of these trolls have little or no education and are in imminent danger of getting fossilized by non trolls voting BJP out of power in more and more states. Nepal is the greatest tragedy of the past 18 months. Enjoy Beijing. Our closest neighbor is now yours.

He said all this in Rajya Sabha on Monday, blaming the Government for every wrong thing that is happening there. He twisted all facts. Prior to him Mr Pawan Verma and D Raja and a few others also charged the government giving a wrong idea about the Govt's moves viz a viz Nepal. <br/><br/>
The external affairs minister Mrs Sushma Swaraj exposed Mani thoroughly, then and there.<br/>
She covered all the points nicely. No body had any question on her. She replied every accusation clearly exposing the members' inadequacy on facts.<br/><br/>
But still he writes the same thing in the article the very next day.<br/><br/>
Does NDTV not know this?

                            Sh. Mani Shankar Aiyar, thank you for exposing Modi's agenda in Nepal. Modi has failed in his foreign policy and by treating Nepal in this manner, Modi has compromised with the security of India. Don't forget, we have open border with Nepal. Modi government's communal policy has failed in India and now it is trying to inflame communal and ethnic conflict in Nepal by openly supporting one group that has been violent. Modi government seem to be supporting criminal elements in Nepal, what a tragic foreign policy.

Even though we may not like Mani Shankar, but shouldnt blindly reject what he writes every time. He has his own view which he has put across. One cannot deny that Nepal policy has been blunder. On one hand we call them brother and on other hand we deny them access to even basic medicine after such a natural disaster. So much ego. Did we make mistake by voting for Modi and BJP. It seems Modi doesnt have one quality. It is called compassion. He thinks he can dole out money and buy people thought and loyalty.. What kind of development policies will be made by this person who doesnt have any compassion.... Will his policy benefit people or only industrialists. Modi and BJP shouldnt forget that after  four years again election will come.

                            An excellant and well researched article highlighting the true fact of current Indo-Nepal relation. Only 11 out of 116 elected Madhesi 'Terai region' voted against the constitution is the burning proof to highlight that only a minority section of Madhesi Group in Nepal were against the new Nepal constitution, But Modi ignite the fuel with fire by sidening with those minor section and provoking the entire country who still hasn't recovered from devastating earthquake, and worse by putting an undeclared blockade for the last 3 months. This is not humane in any forms, shape and size. Now with no food, fuel, gas, medicine for winter, if the entire Nepalese are against the India, then it is no fault of their own...but only due to the man-made crisis generate by the namo 'Modi'.

                            To all my Indian friends: Truth hurts and I can tell you that Mr. Aiyer is 100% right on this. If you read Nepal's constitution, you will find that it is an inclusive and democratic document that does not discriminate against any group. Almost all of the leaders of Madheshi groups helping Modi save his face on the blockade had lost elections and they are trying to gain ground. In fact they lost election to other Madheshi leaders who voted for the constitution. There are social issues that definitely need to be sorted out through strict anti-discriminatory laws and all Nepalis whether from the hills or Terai are in support of such laws. Holding the entire nation hostage and creating a humanitarian crisis for petty differences that could be addressed through constitution amendment is inhuman and unacceptable.

                            Thanks to Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyer. Indians salute you for exposing the communal and criminal agenda of the Modi Government in Nepal. Modi government has not only punished the people of Nepal for not submitting to his bully but also compromised with the security of India. Please remember we have an open border with Nepal and it stretches to more than 1500 hundred kilometers. Those fools who support Modi's stance should go to the border and observe for themselves. Modi has done a great damage to India and Nepal by imposing the undeclared economic blockade on Nepal and creating a humanitarian crises which Nepalese will never forgive for generations. I as an Indian condemn the communal politics of BJP and support and salute Nepal for not bowing to Modi government's agenda. Indians have a long historical and religious affinity and relations with Nepal. Modi may not realize that thousands of Nepalese serve in the Indian army. Why is he punishing not only Nepalese but all the Nepalese who serve the Indian army. Modi is famous for his backwaas.. He had told the Nepali speaking Gorkahelse in Darjeeling during the parliament elections that the dream of the gorhalese is his dream. He has forgotten the gorkalese and his own dream after becoming PM, he used those words only to beg votes. No wonder people call him the FEKU PM of India. Shame on those who support communal and criminal elements. Shame on those who disturb the peace and harmony of Nepal.

What is Modi doing to Nepal? Why is the opposition silent when we are creating this mess on our border. We will pay the price for this in the coming generations. Nepal will become friendly with Pakistan and China and we will end up with another hostile neighbor where we could have had a friend. Next we will have terrorists transiting through Nepal into India. <br/><br/>
And all because the Nepalese said they were secular and didnt want our dictation when it came to drafting their constitution?? THis is incredibly silly on our part.

                            Here is a comment from a Nepali. Mani Shankar Aiyer's dislike of Modi aside, there is no denying the fact that the Indian Government's handling of Nepal is a blunder. Why a blunder? Because like Mr. Pawan Kumar Verma said it runs the risk of handing over Nepal to China on a platter. How so? It better come from Indian think tanks and diplomatic pundits rather than from me. The blunder, however, is more on the part of the Indian bureaucracy which rules the roost when it comes to handling Nepal. The Indian Ambassador has always acted as Vice Roy in Nepal with direct access to and strong influence on all key political leaders, including PM and President. Diplomatic protocol has never been applied in Nepal. Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj appears clueless on Nepal. She has certainly not been briefed correctly. Otherwise, how would you account for two grave factual mistakes in her statements in Rajya Sabha: 1) Citizenship by naturalization for Indian daughter-in-laws in Nepal has not been removed in the new constitution as she claimed. The fact is that the exact same clause in the interim constitution has been maintained as is. 2) Nepal promulgated the new constitution hastily in a matter of two days without adequate time for consultations, discussions and debate. The fact is that each and every procedure of the constituent assembly would be very much out in the media. People knew about the understanding between major political parties and a definite timetable for the promulgation was disclosed weeks in advance. It is just that the Indian Ambassador thought that it was still within him to be able to dissuade the key leaders in Nepal. When he realized that it was out of his reach and therefore asked for the Special Envoy of Modi, it was a little too late.

                            Nepalese have always hated India and Indian's. It is not that this current crisis has brought about this hatred. The Nepalese people only used the current situation to display this hatred. <br/>
If you go to Nepal, you will understand how much they hate the Indians. They will always be ungrateful to India. They have even forgotten the assistance provided to them during Nepal Earthquake....

                            After being totally exposed as an Pakistan-loving anti-national scumbag - this ludicrous buffoon wants to now start ranting about Nepal - which he believed without any evidence or rational to be India's "Fault" while half a dozen Madhesi leaders in New Delhi this week themselves say this is the THIRD Madhesi revolt against the Nepali Pahadi elites in Nepal's independent history!

                            Its shameful to see many people commenting out against the author for his political affiliations than the merits in his argument. Its a very dangerous step by the current Govt. to even entertain voices of descent in Nepal in India's capital. Over the years our botched foreign policy with our smaller neighbors (in terms of economy and size) has seen India being seen as their enemy than a friend. I would hate to see Nepal turn to nations like Pakistan or China if this continues. Nepal has always been a very good neighbor and it would be really sad to loose that relationships. I hope at least some in the Govt. are able to see past the bs and able to rise above cast/divide politics India is current playing in Nepal.

1 communist govt in Nepal will learn hard way like Burma did, giving a blow job to china is not a good option. Nepalis are proud and can believe whatever their govt peddles,soon that will change when Marching orders from Beijing won't be acceptable to them.<br/><br/>
2 I agree with Nepalis, India should stop being big brother, India should be an adult and give them space to grow. Just cautious, that they don't harm themselves, Nepalis will soon realize self inflicted wounds.

                            Mani Shankar A-hole is a boot licker who was silent when the Congress party was looting the nation.  He is a retarded person who will stoop to an level to impress his mistress Sonia Gandhi. The rogue goes to Pakistan and asks them to literally eliminate Modi.  What kind of a person does that?  He needs a few slaps and he will be fine.  Just ask Sharad Pawar about the curative effect of a slap.

                            Mani, how could you stoop so low in spite of your education &amp; upbringing? If you can't add value to India, why wouldn't you stop doing a damage?
