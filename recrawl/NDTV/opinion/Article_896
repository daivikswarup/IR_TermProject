Headline::::What Bihar Result Will Mean For Modi



DateTime::::2015-11-02T04:23:00+05:30




                                Amit Shah seems to believe that if "by mistake" the BJP were to bite the dust in Bihar, there would be firecrackers of celebration in Pakistan. On the contrary, fireworks would burst in India, and particularly in Bihar, if the BJP were smashed, as 70% of the electorate that did not vote for Modi even in 2014 celebrate the end of the Modi-Shah juggernaut and are joined by millions of Modi's erstwhile voters who are thoroughly disillusioned with 500 days of "achche din".
That the end for the BJP is nigh is palpable. Even the satta bazaar that had hitherto been backing Modi is turning the odds in Nitish Kumar's favour. By most accounts, Nitish is overtaking Modi - and panic appears to be overtaking the BJP. For the election being a two-horse race, even a small majority in the percentage of votes would translate into a huge majority of seats. One TV correspondent who has been traveling extensively around Bihar in recent weeks bluntly predicted in a private conversation with me that the Mahagathbandhan would "sweep" the polls. Others have been predicting this publicly. Coming after the slaughtering to which Arvind Kejriwal subjected the BJP in the Delhi assembly elections, their myth of invincibility would be definitively blown.
With defeat staring them in the face, desperation is becoming evident in the electoral idiom of Modi and his cohort. Their election speeches are getting more and more coarse, drifting towards the "tapori." Calling the three leaders of the Grand Alliance "3 Idiots" is to sink towards the gutter. Starting with decrying Nitish Kumar's DNA, Modi's satire has run to describing Lalu Yadav's daughter as "bechari beti." The young woman, Misa, has retorted, "Modi se kisi bhi shabd ki apeksha thi. Woh kisi bhi nari ka samman kar hi nahi sakte kyonki woh RSS ke hain aur wahan auraton ka sthan sirf paer dhone ka hai (We can expect any kind of expression from Modi, he is from the RSS, where the woman's place is restricted to washing men's feet)". To which her father has added, "On the one hand, Modi talks of 'beti bachao, beti padhao', but, on the other, extends no respect to any daughter".
What is it that takes the BJP's language of politics to that level and pushes Nitish into responding that he, for his part, "can't stoop to that level?" Is it merely that Modi's sense of humour has failed him? Or is Modi turning hysterical as he foresees that defeat in Bihar will call into question his entire strategy of taking and keeping power? That his authoritarianism will come under challenge? That the Bihar result is part of a wider and deeper rejection of what he and his Sangh Parivaar stand for? That empty talk of "development" can no longer befool people into believing he does indeed have a new agenda of development? For the spiralling price of tur and urad dal is as much the consequence of the Modi model of development as is the collapse of the rupee in relation to the dollar to the lowest level ever. The Modi-Shah duo are discovering in Bihar that the mystique of the "Gujarat model" that carried them to victory in 2014 is now evaporating as the realization dawns that the model is for the "suited and booted" and not for Everyman, that the key to its appeal to the wealthy lay in the way it rode roughshod over the helpless and the voiceless tribals and the destitute.
It also lies in people realizing that Modi cannot forever distance himself from the deeply divisive, intolerant and insensitive statements of his ministers, MPs, MLAs, governors and party leaders, that his very silence over their repeated transgressions constitutes endorsement - and that such endorsement is not acceptable to at least three-quarters of our people who comprise both those who did not vote for him even last year and those who did but are now swelling the ranks of the dissenting disillusioned. Modi rode out his crushing rejection in the Delhi polls. But his political investment in Bihar has been so heavy that if his party loses there on Sunday, 8 November, as it seems to be doing, the loss will be personally attributed to him. He cannot get away with claiming victory for himself when his party wins and passing the buck to others when his party loses.
When this election's post-mortem is written, perhaps someone will find that it was the wrong Modi that was projected - instead of the votes that Sushil Modi has won for the BJP, Narendra Modi has lost them and more. By making himself the focus of the campaign when at the start it looked as if the BJP would be victorious in Bihar, Modi thought he would garner all the credit unto himself; what has happened on the ground is that the more Modi has involved himself, the more rapidly has the ground beneath the BJP's feet slipped. His much-hyped "package" for Bihar has been quickly exposed as the re-packaging of what Bihar would in any case have been entitled to get. His attempt to portray the Grand Alliance as clandestinely working towards religion-based reservations has backfired, even as Mohan Bhagwat's remarks on phasing out caste-based reservations have deepened Bihari apprehensions of a BJP restructuring of the architecture of reservations. The Election Commission has added to Modi's misery by banning BJP ads that attempt to build on Modi's dark hint about existing quotas being shaved to carve out a separate quota for "another community".
And as veteran journalist MK Venu has pointed out, "By invoking Pakistan, the BJP think it can consolidate Hindu votes across castes". A significant majority of the Bihar electorate have rejected the BJP leadership's attempts at promoting community-based polarization by such innuendo. Similarly, the "beef" games being played by the BJP and the Sangh Parivaar across the country to give them electoral traction have collapsed because voters are seeing through this cynical, dangerous game.
What everyone also sees is that the results of this election will not be confined to Bihar. They will reverberate across the land and be heard most particularly in the national capital. The bugle would sound for the fractured Opposition to combine its might to present a united front to the Central government. Authoritarians like Mussolini, Hitler and Franco could only consolidate their hold by moving from victory to victory. This strategy has been characteristic of Narendra Modi. However, in Delhi, he stumbled, especially after he ostentatiously pushed CM-candidate Kiran Bedi aside to lead the campaign from the front - and, in consequence, brought the BJP to its knees in the face of the AAP challenge. If in Delhi he stumbled, in Bihar he is falling off the cliff for the same sin of sidelining the local BJP leadership.
As soon as the results are out, the rumblings already being heard in the BJP and Sangh Parivaar ranks will rise to a crescendo. The era of Modi dominance is coming to an end. The end of the Modi era itself is in the offing.(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            If Modi loses it will be embarrassing for the BJP, but the surprising thing to note is that everyone saying this is a matter of survival for Modi and BJP, more than BJP it is the Nitish, Lalu and Congress who have joined hands to be politically relevant. If BJP wins all these guys will be in abyss and ride into oblivion. So its more important for these guys to win than BJP

                            All these liberals didn't object when Akbarudin Owaisi threatened to kill all Indian Hindus in 15 min. They didn't object when fatwas were issued against Javed Akhtar, AR Rehman, Taslima Nasreen. They didn't object when Pandits were driven out of Kashmir. They didn't object when Hindus were banned from performing Durga Puja in West Bengal by illegal Bangladeshis. They didn't object when Sikhs were massacred in Delhi. I'm not saying that I'm in favor of right-wing thugs, if you intend to speak out about intolerance on our country, do it equitably.

                            Mr. Aiyer, after all of the damage your party has wrought for 60+ years, you keep coming back for more. It has been barely one and a half years after Mr. Modi has been elected. Have this government made mistakes? Absolutely yes. But I have not lost my faith in Modi's intentions to make India the superpower it should have become decades ago. For 60+ years, while Japan and China have been soaring ahead, because bloody Congress politicians have been eating our money like dogs. I can only recall two prime ministers who have put this country on growth oriented track: PV Narasimha Rao &amp; AP Vajpayee.  Vapayee was BJP, and Rao was hounded by his own party until his death. Please leave the common man alone Congress Party. I do not believe that the buffoon Rahul Gandhi can even lead a party, let alone rule the country

                            A leader of a country holding the highest position such as Prime Minister should not use unacceptable words or say something even though sounds comic. Rather he should talk about reforms that his government will bring. He should rather speak wise and show the right path to people. He/ she should try the best to win the trust of men and women of his country.

                            Mani - It is hilarious to see your desperation reach new depths. Not one word about how the alliances stack up in terms of development promises. Not one word about even your beloved Khangress or Pappu. The blog entirely dedicated to vent your frustration about Modi and hoping that BJP loses the Bihar election. Look at the way you describe the decisive election of 2014. "70% people rejected Modi". And how did you arrive at this number? 35% of the electorate did not even vote. 30% voted for Modi. So, you mean to say the people who did not vote "rejected" Modi? What kind of warped logic is this? Looks like you have become senile. None of your blogs till date have any constructive criticism. I feel pity for you looking at the amount of hatred and frustration you are living in. Get this into your head - The Congress will never ever come back to power in the next 100 years as long as you keep serving the interests of one family. We are not a monarchy. If people dont like the BJP's governance, they will vote for some other party - BUT not the congress. Wait till founder of the family line is made naked when the Netaji files are disclosed. I wish you a long age MSI. You need to be alive to see India progress under a non-congress rule and people spitting on dynastic politics and sycophants.

                            Mr. Iyer, you projected the same "End of Modi" during 2014 Loksabha elections---it turned out to be " End of Khangress"....how does it feel to not have enough seats to even become opposition leader in Parliament? The same thing will happen in Bihar now!<br/><br/>
Look I know it's hard to digest but try to see that India is no longer a Leftist-land. It is finally turning towards true nationalism...You can no longer keep true Indians subdued under the Islamic rule...you did everything in your power to keep India enslaved by poverty, minority appeasement, giving away free stuff to Muslims and dividing Hindus based on caste so that your vote bank is secured...but not anymore---true Hindu nationalist and patriotic leader with the divine help has woken up other Hindus and now your communist agendas are going to fail!!

                            OK, in Bihar it is a fight between Modi and Nitish, and let the best man win. Where is the Congress in all this? I thought that Aiyer belonged to the Congress, or like the proverbial rat has he jumped the sinking ship? Aiyer should remember that there is a difference between optimism and wishful thinking. It is optimistic to hope that Modi will lose in Bihar. It is wishful thinking to think that a loss in Bihar will diminish Modi's relevance. He will continue as Prime Minister till 2019 at the very least. As to the Congress, Sonia Mama, Rahul Baba and Aiyer the Sycophant, tera kya hoga Kaliya? Think over it well, before you rush to make observations on your betters! Aiyer should try to join the BJP (if they agree to take him) if he wants some future relevance.

                            Expose this world's sycophant no. 1<br/>
Look at the sycophant's highly  despicable double standards in his  anti-modi tirade, biases as visible in his latest pre-conceived salvos against Modi.<br/>
Fact 1. The sycophant says 70 percent didn't vote for Modi. <br/>
Nehru's Congress in First General Election of India in 1951-52 polled 45 percent of popular votes only.  So does he also have to say that 55 percent didn't vote for the Congress then and hence there was no popular support as Nehru garnered below 50 percent? Does it make any good sense to the sycophant?<br/><br/>
FACT 2. On AAP's victory, the sycophant says that Arvind Kejriwal, on behalf of him, his Khongress and all the other non-bjp parties, jolted the BJP's juggernaut. Oh, you being so sympathetic to AAP, why don't you join them or ask for Khongress to merge itself in AAP? Why the occassional cosmetic cries against AAP in Delhi, when you think that AAP is politically of your ilk, i.e., tooth and nail opposed to bjp? <br/><br/>
FACT 3. The hypocrite talks of satta-bazaar. Oh, no thats illegal to talk about the same and to present it something to be ever believed in, of course least in the public space. Who will tell this hypocrite to stop rationalising your anti-modi tirade by  something called satta-bazaar?<br/><br/>
FACT 4. He talks of Modi's communalism or BJP anti- secularism stance. But can he also say that Muslims in India remained backward because of Khongress who has used them as a mere vote-bank since Independence. Even a chunk of vast corruption monies, which the Khongress ate away, had been spent on Muslims of this country, they would have become resourceful and would not, then, allow themselves to be used as a mere vote-bank, but nah, this fact will badly pinch to the most sensitive part of this sycophant!!! Even if BJP creates fears in minorities, then Khongress advantages through fearmongerings!!<br/><br/>
FACT 5. Re-packaging of Bihar Grants: The hypocrite avers: Bihar in any case would have got the package and Modi just re-packaged the grant. Why you are so dishonest mate, why don't you admit that Khongress has been successively playing politics with Bihar. You and your party were in centre for so many years, what stopped you to give Bihar a special package. If those are re-packaging of old programmes, then would that not mean that you and your party deliberately avoided spending on the development in Bihar??? Play straight hypocrite, what are you talking about? Further, why you are pre-judging the whole issue, why can't you wait to see what unfolds out of this special ecomnomic announcement? But, you won't as you have only a single agenda to remain engaged in anti-modi tirade.<br/><br/>
FACT 6. You are talking of Modi crediting the wins and no losses. You calculatedly ignore that this is real-politicking and if you are making it applicable on Modi's bjp, then equally in full measure the same must be applicable over Rahul and Sonia.  Why the duo, despite congress reduced to 40s allowed to retain their party's top political positions? They should have taken liability for the poll result and resigned from their positions and allowed leaders like sachin pilot to take top positions in the party. But, nah, you are one hell of a top hypocrite who likes to apply rules only on bjp and attempts to selfishly shy away from applying the same yardstick on yourself and your party!!!!<br/><br/>
Lets re-package the hypocritical mal-adjustments of this fellow so as to bring sanity to his otherwise severely damaged sycophantic mind and thus to help him avoid the early evaporation into dark oblivion!!!

"in the last 12 months, what is the list of useful things that you have done that benefited or created wealth for the country". just list atleast few things for the nation in a way that atleast qualitatively helped the country.

                            If Modi's end is nearby what does the Bihar election say about the Congress, the CONgress party is contesting only 14 percent of Bihar seats, that means even if CONgress wins all its seats it will still be a minority party nowhere near a strong BJP. So is the CONgress history or Mr. Mani are yu going to continue to bow in front of that twit Rahul Gandhi

                            Forget PAkistan a great secular nation as defined by Obama celebrating BJP loss in Bihar, So many secular people in media, political parties, thinkers, writers, academy award winners, scientists, communists will celebrate and burst crackers on BJP defeat. Mani will join them. Mani with all his knowledge is scared to lead the Congress by being the President of Congress, VP of Congress or the PM candidate of Congress. He is simply hiding being Sonia and Rahul and speaking. Mani withe all his knowledge, experience could not even become the CM of Tamil Nadu nor lead Congress to victory in Tamil Nadu. He is hiding behind sonia. What is the use if such educated literate and experienced leader like Mani hides behind Sonia instead of leading India. A Chai wala or a milk man or a sweeper has the guts to lead India but not educated man like Mani who is hiding behind Sonia and writing articles for MEdia. It is sad that an educated man like Mani is scared to lead Congress as PResident of Congress.

                            Why no comment from Mani the moron on the fact that Sonia Gandhi, who Mani the moron worships, shared the dais with a convicted fraudster sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. Lalu?  Why no comment on the fact that 'Harvard Lecturer' Misa Bharti, daughter of the fraudster had replaced then loyal Lalu supporter Ram Kishore Yadav by reason only of the fact that she was the daughter of the fraudster?  Why no mention of the fact that it was not the BJP that was defeated in Delhi.  The government in power before AAP was the Congress Sheila Dikshit government.  Mani the moron's thick head cannot comprehend that one cannot defeat a body that was not in power!  Why no mention of the fact that two of the fraudster Lalu's illiterate sons have been given tickets to contest?  The fact is that Mani the moron  has never been able to accept that an ordinary Gujju who never went anywhere near either Doon School, or St Stephen's or Cambridge won a national election using a system put in place by Nehru and his cohorts.  Perhaps Mani the moron is under the impression that Modi has put a halt to his, Mani's, surreptitious trips to Pakistan to negotiate on behalf of India using Track 2 methods which he has no mandate to do?  Modi and his party got the support of 30% of the electorate in a nation of 1.25 billion people.  Mani the moron, in reality a Madrassi given to exaggerating his own importance, could not even hang on to his own deposit in the heart of his constituency in the Madrassi heartland.  Mani the moron has therefore resorted to what he knows best; spewing uninterrupted and interruptible Modi bashing garbage!   There is one glint of light at the end of the tunnel though; at the age of 74, this irrelevant moron has started looking increasingly frail and can therefore be described as a coffin-dodger.  However, it will not be too long before the coffin engulf's the moron!

                            Mr Aiyer, If Modi goes another leader will come up in BJP, Do not have any doubt whatsoever. Please ponder as to what will happen to Congress, If Rahul, Sonia or Priyanka are not there in your congress party. We always found Congress and other regional parties to be filled with sycophants. <br/>
We conveniently ask BJP to provide detailed achievements of its 500 days of rule. It would have been better if the likes of Sonia, Nitish and Lalu would have provided statistics as to what they had done for the State and how the state has performed in various fields during the past years when they had ruled the State.<br/>
Further You were one of the good and able minister then why did Congress side line you? Believe me this Government is doing well and will do well in future as well.

                            The BJP and its partners the LJP and the RLSP got nearly 39 per cent of the votes, compared to 30 per cent by the RJD, the Congress and the NCP, and only 17 per cent by the JD(U) and its partner the CPI. Why not you tell how much percentage you got? And how many seats you are fighting in Bihar?<br/>
Your party was number was 1 party in Bihar and UP and now just fringe player on 4th number which will win 5-10 out of 243 seats as predicted in most opinion poll. Just think about ur party before attacking. With such huge number of parties gone are days when any party will ever more than 35-40% of votes share.Let me predict one thing now, ur party will be eaten by AAP election by election. BJP still got 32 percent vote in delhi, it was you who lost all vote share that AAP won so emphatically.

He still has a full majority of his own, and he is the unquestioned leader - BJP is Modi and Modi is BJP. Where are the rumblings that Mani is referring to? Is he referring to nonentity Shotgun Sinha who even Bihar BJP doesn't listen to? It will be nice if Mani uses some defensible logic in his articles for a change.

It is very clear that every one is after Modi critising him for everthing....... But i am very confident that he is not going to bow down. He would win whaterver comes his way.

                            Mani talks about AAP victory with such fondness as if it was Rahul's victory. It was a humiliating defeat for BJP but it came after a series of victories and of course the winning streak has to end at some point. Funny thing is Mani shud remember that Congress got around 8% votes and 0 seats in Delhi, the same state which they have ruled for 15 years. And all this talk about united opposition is all gas. United opposition has atleast 5 PM aspirants and none of them will let anyone else become the PM. Would Lalu let Nitish become the voice of opposition? Wud Kejriwal let Rahul Gandhi become the voice of opposition?

                            I still believe that JDU and BJP alliance could have won full majority, but not it is very tight. I don't think Bihar results will be anything to do Modi as he is not the face for CM and if he still run as PM candidate, he will still win LS seats in Bihar.

                            You have brilliantly expressed the thoughts of the silent majority. This is the beginning of the end of Modi Raj. We need to win our country back!

                            Mani Shanker cannot win a single election himself. his so called leaders barely manage to win their own seats and have brought Congress from number one pary for long to also ran in practically all the states. Imagine him talking about a mass leader like Modi nwho has guts to face the electorate.

                            I guess Mani is imagining a lot. Congress Party has that culture to protect Dynasty. I challenge Mani to keep Pappu responsible for eventual debacle for Congress in Bihar Election. Lets see if you can see him in Congress next day. Modi hatred of yours on Tea Stall remark didn't affect Modi. He in fact getting stronger every passing State Election. Congress allies in Bihar not sure if single Congress Candidate can win. That's the sorry state of affairs. I wish Mani focus on his home state Tamil Nadu instead of commenting on National Picture.

                            Everyday by opening his mouth Modi brings down dignity of the highest office he's holding to a new low. Slum people talks and behave better than him.

                            Now that the results are out, even Rahul seems smart. Modi/BJP/RSS...please learn or else the country will go back to Congress.  You do not have forever but only 40 months for the next elections.  People can every easily be enchanted if you do not deliver what you promise.  Save us from Congress and do concentrate on delivery on ground.

                            Instead of concentrating on how to revive the party that he belongs to, why is he so obsessed with Modi, always? Why couldn't he use his so called 'wisdom' to enlighten his masters with borrowed surname all these years? Is it that he is NOT allowed to come up with his 'intelligent' advises when they were messing up with the nation with all those mega scams?

                            It is natural that in LOCAL ELECTIONS people will support the party who rules the STATE since local Panchayats &amp; Municipalities   have to  get funds from the State.  Unless there is high amount of hatred against the ruling party of the state, people will tend to vote for the party who rules the State.  Hence defeat in Panchayat and Municipal elections should not be considered as referendum against  BJP s performance in the Central Government, or  endorsement of Samajvadi Party's rule on UP .

                            So BJP is done and dusted in Bihar. To think Modi wasted so much of his time in Bihar bad mouthing NItish and Lallu; when he could have been taking foreign trips and selfies. 😋

                            Dream On Mani Shankar Aiyar .  All corrupt congress people are singing Koyee Lota Dey Meray Corrupt Money Making Din. Its the might of the combined three big parties to have any chance against Modi Ji and BJP?  If the Mahagadhbandhan Looses than what  would happen to Sonia and her Tenth failed Son Raul Gandhi. They will be send to the dust bin of History.  Congress having lost so much over the last two years still has the nerve to show their faces in public.  Congress is not a political party but Gandhi Family business and they are the only owners and profit makers. Mani Shankar is just the poodle in their game.

                            I think Manishankara aiyyar will not have any Twitter Account or gives EMial Address to any body. except to NDTV. For waht Congress is doing in Rajaya Sabha and outside I am of the Opinion that NDA will win Bihar.
