Headline::::For Me, He Was Kalam 'Garu', Writes Chandrababu Naidu for NDTV.com



DateTime::::2015-07-29T13:56:00+05:30




                                Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. The world knows him as India's Missile Man and the People's President. To me, he was the personification of humility, generosity and optimism. Kalam garu, as I always called him, was one of the finest human beings I have met. He was a dear friend and one of the few people I have always looked up to in my life.
Kalam garu's ingenuous spontaneity always inspired me. Having observed him closely, I'm one among the millions across the globe who always enjoyed his interactive speeches. One such instance was when Kalam garu and I shared the dais last year while launching the Primary Sector Mission (focusing on Agriculture) in Anantapur district. While addressing a gathering of farmers, he called them "farmer friends" and spoke fluently in Telugu. He told them that they are a mighty force and are partners in nation's development.
I remember vividly how he made farmers recite a poem titled "I will fly" that he had written. "I will fly... I'm born with potential, I'm born with goodness and trust, I'm born with ideas and dreams, I'm born with confidence, I'm born with wings...I'm not meant for crawling, I have wings...I will fly...I will fly...I will fly," he recited, with love for farmers. He also spoke extensively about the integration of technology in agriculture.

From Rameswaram to Raisina Hill, his journey is an outstanding example of what a human being can achieve through hard work, perseverance and determination. 
My first meeting with Kalam garu was during my first term as the Chief Minister of united AP when we had met over "Vision 2020". That was when he had given me a task of preparing a draft for "Vision 2020" while he was working on it. 
A memory of Kalam garu's humbleness that is etched in my mind is when he defied protocol as the President of India and visited me at my Jubilee Hills residence on October 3rd, 2003, soon after I survived the Alipiri Blast. He enquired about my health and had spoken about the essential qualities of leadership. I'm glad to have had the opportunity of collectively proposing his name for the President during Vajpayee-ji's Prime Ministership.
From nurturing India's guided Missile program to keeping the doors of Rashtrapati Bhawan open to people, he went to great lengths to make himself accessible and approachable to the people of this country. 
One cannot forget instances of Kalam garu's humility where he had invited a cobbler as one of the Presidential Guests to Raj Bhavan in Kerala, nor can one overlook the fact that he had posted a question on Yahoo Answers asking the public "What do we do to free the planet from terrorism?"
His undying love for children and the zeal to encourage, ignite minds of millions was laudable. He was an epitome of knowledge, intellect and love. He has always believed that the best teachers are facilitators of innovation, of new ideas, creators of lifelong habit of innovative thinking.  
In some of our conversations, he told me that he enjoys being a teacher. "It gives me immense satisfaction and joy," he said, adding, "which other profession enjoys such recognition and is as crucial to the development of the human race as a whole?"  Such was his thought-process.
He had no space for pettiness, disharmony, jealousy, hatred or enmity in his life and believed that education transforms a human being into a wholesome unit, a noble soul and an asset to the universe. Real education enhances the dignity of a human being and increases his or her self-respect. 
He taught us how to dream big, without the fear of winning or losing. He continues to live in our hearts. Above all, he showed the world he was a simple man with big dreams.
Let us strive to make this world a better place to live in and aim for success of an India he dreamt of. 
In Kalam garu's words: "The country doesn't deserve anything less than success from us. Let us aim for success."N. Chandrababu Naidu is the Chief Minister of the new state of Andhra Pradesh and the president of the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP). Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            India is still having some good visionary politicians like Mr Naidu who learn from others and implemented them. Mr Naidu did good job as CM of united Andhra. He always has a roadmap for development.<br/><br/>
No doubt Mr Kalam has inspired people from all walks of life. It is a irreparable loss to country.

                            Some times words flow as if they are meant to be written and preserved, and burn us inside out to make (im)perfect pitch to pour out our feelings.  Some time what you want to say to your father posthumous, you have no place but buried, now pour out to a person close to your father like.  Yes some times the engulfed agony for carved people, you may not show for fear of words being interpreted wrongly, do come out without any interruption, - some randomly and some not but all along feelings of missing.  Any way the show must go on.  Pray the Almighty to rest in peace his soul for a better commandment in the next birth if exists. Mr.Naidu had expressed so succinctly, that we appreciate the endeavor.

                            Good tribute to Abdul Kalamji Chandrababu Naidu Garu.<br/>
Abdul Kalamji is an embodiment of simplicity,modesty and honesty.<br/>
Here are is famous sayings:<br/>
" It means,people who are in high and responsible positions,if they go against righteousness,righteousness itself will get transformed into destroyer".<br/><br/>
To fulfill the dreams of Abdul Kalamji of " Great India",let AP Government adopt'People First' policy minimising luxuries,connected with people and utilising resources and resourcefulness in the state. What people aspire is 'Government of the people,by the people and for the people' but not 'Government off the people, bye the people and far from the people'<br/>

                            It is really a pride that all politicians irrespective of their affiliations and idealogy, have unanimously praised Dr. Kalam. One hopes his inspiration makes them work together in all spheres to make his dream come true about a self-sufficient and progressed India.

                            The missile scientist's death has set me thinking about the deluge of encomiums flooding all print, electronic and social networking media. We the people of this nation are INSPIRED by this great visionary and also his achievements in science. We are all basking in the glory of a great human being who led an exemplary life.  What is amusing and incomprehensible is that how can a person be proud of someone else' s glory or achievements we need to have our own to take pride and boast rather than a Gandhi, Buddha, Mother Theresa, JRD Tata, Bhabha , Sarabhai, Kalam or many unsung nondescript heros. Since his death there has been a great outpouring of messages, quotes and anecdotes from the life of missile scientist. His life indeed has been inspiring but now the pertinent question remains how do you make him immortal. Don't count me as a cynical moron but as a nation we cannot go beyond being inspired; yet nothing much changes we carry on with our own selfish and normal lives as the days progress. We can continue to hear about the nepotism (now I prefer vyapamism), red tapism for a common man while pushover for the powerful, rich and affluent, dysfunctional judiciary, corruption, rape, terrorism,  scamster politicians and bureaucrats, nexus between criminals and politicians, exploitation, regionalism, religion intolerance and casteism, procrastinating students, an unethical and fraudulent medical practitioner. Truly, the list would seem endless but  would definitely remain incomplete without the inclusion of each ONE of us, because we all are living a hypocritical and hedonistic life to satisfy our insatiable human greed. Now the question remains where did the inspiration disappear or vanish? We need to live lives beyond being INSPIRED. The man has left an ineffaceable imprint in the minds and hearts of so many people around the world. While we were happy sharing and spreading all those memories left by this special person. Now the whole and big question comes what next? There were so many people earlier than missile scientist who led similar or not so profound but still memorable lives. The flurry of tweets, messages and good tidings about his life excites us all enough. Does this suffice for some realistic transformation in any of us? This may sound preposterous but the sad truth remains that nothing changes in our national politics or in our own personal lives We continue to live like before until the death of another great soul. The cycle repeats with fresh round of accolades for the next inspiring noble soul. We are always searching for nobility and inspiration from others while we ourselves suspire for our own pretty ordinary and selfish lives.

                            It is clear diminishing the image of Mr APJ Abdul Kalam by allowing a third rated politician like Babu write an article about him. Moreover, this crook politician claims "I made Kalam as president". Shame on you Babu, "who the hell are you to make Kalam as president"? Get out of the way of a legend and stop claiming false associations.

CBN said agriculture is a waste and gave least preference to farming as CM, resulting in migration of farmers to laborers and suicides. Now CBN is writing OPeds saying that he will look up to Kalam.
