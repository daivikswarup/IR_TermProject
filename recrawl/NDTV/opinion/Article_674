Headline::::What Emergency Meant For Big Business in India

                                Ahead of the fortieth anniversary of the Emergency, there has been a predictable rash of commentary on that dark interlude in India's democratic experience. It is predictable not just in terms of the people who have written or spoken out, but also the manner in which we think about that period. The Emergency continues to be widely seen as a memento mori - an episode that should remind us of the fragility of our democratic institutions, the weakness of our commitment to preserving liberties, and the dangers of slipping into an authoritarian mode of governance. Think only of L.K. Advani's recent, circumlocutory remarks.
The tendency to look back at the Emergency in these terms is entirely understandable. After all, this period witnessed not just the suspension of liberties and subversion of institutions, but also the deployment of state power against the most defenceless sections of society. Yet, such an approach also detracts from a closer historical assessment of the causes and consequences of the Emergency.
Any such account must begin by acknowledging that while the Emergency had clear start and end dates, it cannot be understood in isolation from longer trends and processes. Nor can we grasp its import for our recent history if we see it only as a high political drama.
Consider the economic dimensions of the Emergency. Few now recall the economic backdrop to the story. In the run up to the Emergency, the Indian economy was buckling under a set of cumulative strains caused by the Bangladesh refugee crisis and war with Pakistan, the ensuing termination of aid by the United States, the recurrent failure of monsoons, and the international oil crisis following the Arab-Israeli war of 1973. The oil shock made a deep dent on the Indian economy. There was a rapid slide in balance of payments and rampant inflation from mid-1973 to September 1974. At its peak during this period, inflation touched 33 percent. This spiralling inflation played a significant role in triggering popular protests against the government - protests that widened into the JP movement and subsequently led to the imposition of the Emergency.
This period also witnessed the beginnings of important changes in Indira Gandhi's economic policy. Following the Congress party's poor performance in the elections of 1967, Mrs. Gandhi had sought to move further to the Left in her politics. This was aimed at cementing both her personal appeal over that of the party's bosses and at securing the parliamentary support of the Left parties once she moved to split the Congress. These political considerations had led to her to adopt more "radical" economic policies such as nationalizing banks, insurance companies and the coal industry, passing the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act to closely regulate businesses, and the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act to comprehensively control foreign investment in India. This "socialist" phase in economic policy continued until 1973, when the mounting economic crisis forced Mrs. Gandhi to adopt a more pragmatic stance.
From mid-1973, the government began pruning its expenditure and tightening monetary policy. In July 1974, Mrs. Gandhi introduced a rather tough package of anti-inflationary policies - fiscal, monetary and income-policy measures - by means of a supplementary budget and ordinances. Many of her senior colleagues and Left-leaning advisors warned her that these measures would be politically costly. Yet she chose to back her team of liberal economic advisors and officials, including a certain Dr. Manmohan Singh. By the end of 1974, inflation was reined in.
To stabilize the current account of balance of payments, Mrs. Gandhi also sought assistance from the IMF. Perhaps the clearest indication of the end of "socialist" phase was the brutal crackdown on the Railway strike of May 1974. In the road leading to the Emergency, then, Mrs. Gandhi was turning to the Right in economics as well as politics. She now lent her ear to advisors like BK Nehru, who urged her to abandon "garibi hatao" for "utpadhan barhao" or increased production, and called for more business-friendly policies.
After the Emergency was imposed, Mrs. Gandhi announced a Twenty Point Programme of economic and social change. The components of this programme relating to industry slotted in smoothly with the ideas suggested by the likes of BK Nehru. Facilitating and accelerating private sector activity was a key part of the government's economic agenda during the Emergency. Big businesses were naturally pleased with this turn in policy. Only weeks before the Emergency was revoked, JRD Tata lauded the "refreshingly pragmatic and result-oriented approach" that had led to "conditions of discipline, productivity, industrial peace, price stability and widespread involvement necessary to achieve rapid economic growth."
Economic data bears this out. If we bracket the year 1979, when Indian GDP fell by 5 percent owing to the second oil shock following the Iranian revolution, India's economic growth in second half of the 1970s averaged a healthy 6 percent - a figure that is comparable to the "boom" of the 1980s. The increase in per capita GDP was accompanied by an increase in productivity owing to higher capital investment. In particular, there was a spectacular rise in private equipment investment since the mid-1970s. Clearly the "animal spirits" of Indian capital were rising from around this time.
It is also not surprising that Big Business welcomed Indira Gandhi's return to office in 1980. Indeed, the Janata government's mismanagement of the economy tends to be forgotten now. The pro-business tilt inaugurated in the mid-1970s was continued and intensified during Mrs. Gandhi's last term in office. This was symbolized by an unprecedented dinner held in her honour in a well-known Delhi hotel in 1980. Her host was India's largest producer of polyester: Dhirubhai Ambani.
So, the Emergency was an important inflection point in the long transformation of the Indian economy and a harbinger of a new pattern of relations between the state and big business. Whether or not we approve of these developments, the fact remains that the Indian economy did move to a higher growth trajectory during these years. Seen from this vantage-point, it seems clear that the Emergency was a more complex period than that portrayed by the conventional wisdom.
Four decades on, it still awaits the attention of historians.

                            Emergency is viewed differently by people of different geographical areas in India. There was a good support for it in South India and partly in Western India, where as Northern India was against it. It really depends on the mood of the majority of people. It depends on the timing and mood of the people. Emergency like situation may be possible now, but not Emergency itself, as the situation now is totally different (media has made majority of people dumb).

                            During Emergency there no ragging in professional colleges, No hoarding of essential goods, Black money was less, Real estate price  came down, Police did not collect hafta,. For the poor real hard working law abiding citizens emergency did not make any difference.It the politicians and the crooks who were affected. Today some politicians own not just large tract of land but even  small towns/cities ( they built with black money ). Some of them dual citizen ships which they do not disclose. Even today do you think media is not biased and free ? they are in the pockets of the politicians - can you challenge these politicians or their goons ? so what freedom are we talking about ?

                            What my parents and grand parents tell me about the Emergency times is that for the time trains plyed on time, there was general order in the society.

                            Emergency had few good dimensions as well. Discipline among Government employees and only on time running in Independent India can relate to emergency period. True there were atrocities by Sanjay Gandhi and team, but can never forget the good aspect of emergency.

                            Interesting to see how regional perceptions of the Emergency continue to persist to this day. Srinath Raghavan (not surprisingly given his South Indian roots) has written in support of the Emergency. <br/><br/>
What is fascinating about the aftermath of the Emergency and the ensuing turmoil caused by the Janata government was that it set up India for an IT boom powered by the South. It can therefore be argued that the Emergency was also a turning point in terms of regional power dynamics. The North fell into disrepair and chaos while the South became the engine of growth

                            It is quite surprising to have comments by sensible people that emergency can instill  discipline and wellbeing in our country. Me. Modi is trying to bet a total mindset change. His initiative of cleanliness, hygiene, yoga, development etc is going to help our country to advance faster than ever. If you don't like him, please vote him and his party out of power the next time. Pl don't try to puncture the wheels that are taking us forward. If you can't behave don't behave, but don't misbehave.

                            While I agree with you that historians need to invest more holistically in their analysis of the days of emergency, but somehow one needs to understand that any major action is always a product of series of interrelated and complex scenarios especially in politics. Also to every action there are direct and indirect effects. Maybe the economic upturn due to improved efficiencies and capital outlays were such byproducts. However, the one important fact that you have missed out is the clientelism approach of congress party to the democratic process of India which led to series of wrong decisions and more importantly caused harm to the institutions of state.

                            It's unfortunate that some  of us feel that trains plying  on time and govt employees working on time were good things about the emergency. These values should be a part of our ethos. We are such a fractured society that we support in competent leadership, regional satraps etc who are not letting the country progress. Modi is trying to install basic values of hygiene, health,productivity etc, which some  people are construing as an emergency. Fellow countrymen don't rock the boat unnecessarily. Pl do not vote for Mr Modi the next time, but please don't mess with our country by opposing everything that's happening.

                            Good to read a different story on Emergency. I myself as a teenager had also learnt lessons in discipline during Emergency.

                            Nehru dominated the Indian political scene from 15th August,1947 till his death in May,1964!He was that "Great Political Banyan" under which no other party or leader could emerge!He was succeeded By LB Shastri as PM from 9/6/1964 to 11/01/1966! Indra Gandhi,(then 48 years old)only daughter of Nehru was chosen as Leader and PM,much to the chagrin of  super senior and senior party veterans! To get rid of "the cantankerous old fossils" of the party, she has to play the role of "Leader of the youth of the nation"with progressive policies and passing acts like "abolition of privy purses of former rajahs","nationalisation of banks", nationalisation of oil,steel,copper etc industries;helped Bangladeshis secure their freedom from Pakistan in 1971,made India a nuclear Power in 1974 and annexed Himalaya state- Sikkim with India in 1975!Despite the animosity of Western Powers&amp;the anti-Indra propaganda of old Congressmen, Congress won 352 seats in 1971 Lok Sabha elections!Yet Raj Narayan,who opposed her&amp; got just 71,499 votes against Indra's tally of 1,83,309 votes filed an election petition <br/>
against her and managed to wn on flimsy charges had her disqualified!As extreme actions lead to extreme reactions,the hype for her quittal and deteriorating law &amp;order situation led her to declare "Emergency"!Guided by the ideas of BK Nehru<br/>
she replaced her earlier slogan"Garibi Hatao' with "Utpadhan badao"(Increase productivity)and introduced liberal economic and social policies!However the <br/>
popular hype against hercompletely over shadowed the good resultsof that Emergency!
