Headline::::Modi's Lakshman Rekha Warning Grossly Inadequate



DateTime::::2014-12-16T21:03:00+05:30



(Siddharth Varadarajan is a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Public Affairs and Critical Theory, Shiv Nadar University)For a man who makes dozens of televised speeches, takes to the radio once a month, tweets at will and is never at a loss for words, Narendra Modi's silence in the face of the communal statements his party colleagues have been making recently is something of a mystery.Even on those occasions when Modi says something critical - as we are told by BJP spokespersons, he has done twice - he discusses the subject in a roundabout way, behind closed doors.The public at large has no way of knowing where he stands on issues like "love jihad", religious conversions, the destruction of the Babri Masjid, and the place of religious minorities in an India that his parivar folks insist is a "Hindu nation".Take the latest reports of Modi advising his party's MPs not to cross the "Lakshman Rekha" of propriety with individual statements that give the opposition a handle to attack the government with. According to BJP leaders, the Prime Minister said this at a meeting of BJP MPs in Parliament this morning, presumably in response to the controversy about Sakshi Maharaj's now-retracted description of Nathuram Godse - the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi - as a "patriot", and Yogi Adityanath's aggressive language on "Hindu pride".Last week, Modi supposedly ticked off Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti for abusing all Indians who do not follow Rama. 'Don't speak as if you are addressing the whole nation,' was the cryptic message our normally loquacious Prime Minister supposedly delivered to BJP MPs, surely an odd way of rebuking someone for saying such a terrible thing.Incidentally, Modi did not criticize his MPs for making statements that are dangerous and divisive; the problem, we are told, was merely that the opposition was using these to its advantage and dragging the government into controversy.On August 15, Modi said there should be a "10 year moratorium" on communal politics. Soon after, the Sangh Parivar in UP started whipping up anti-Muslim hysteria, particularly in those constituencies where by-elections were due. Modi's aide, Amit Shah, handpicked Yogi Adityanath to front the BJP's communal campaign. The RSS devoted a whole issue of its organ, Panchajanya, to the myth of 'love jihad'. This is the same RSS that every BJP leader from Modi down swears allegiance to. None of this drew a Prime Ministerial rebuke, not even a circumlocutious one.By now it should be obvious that the ambiguity in the Prime Minister's messaging is deliberate.Modi will not publicly criticize the hotheads in the Sangh Parivar because they are the committed foot soldiers who translated the promise of 'Mission 272' into reality. Today, he needs them to consolidate the BJP's strength and come to power in crucial states like Uttar Pradesh. At the same time, Modi knows remaining silent is not a very good option because the 12 per cent swing that his talk of "development" generated in the last election will melt away if voters realize they have been duped. Across the country, millions of people reposed faith in Modi because they believed his promise of jobs, growth and prosperity. The last thing these supporters want to see is the country dragged down by the hate politics of the RSS. That is why the BJP lets it be known from time to time that Modi is unhappy with what some party leaders are saying. On the ground, of course, nothing much changes.Communalism plays a useful role for politicians in power. It helps divert attention from their failure to deliver, provided, of course, those in power are able to carefully calibrate its deployment. If, by 2018, the good days he promised are not here, Modi is likely to be grateful for Adityanath's exertions. But today, the Prime Minister's interests are not served by parivar hotheads escalating communal tension so quickly.The strategy of appeasing the likes of Adityanath and accommodating the 'cultural' agenda of the RSS in education and other fields makes sense in the long run if a large enough chunk of voters who want development and jobs can eventually be turned into political Hindus. In the short-run, however, there is always the risk of the pot boiling over. So why is Modi willing to risk compromising social harmony when his work to revive the economy has barely begun?Could it be that he realizes the enormity of the task he has undertaken and lacks confidence in his ability to deliver on his election promises? Is it that he lacks the political clout needed to discipline the Sangh Parivar? Perhaps he is not as good an 'administrator' as his supporters had assumed. Or perhaps he doesn't recognize the danger signs that are building up in UP and elsewhere.Frankly, I am not sure what the reasons for his silence and inaction are. But unless he breaks his silence and publicly condemns the hate-mongering that is going on all around us, India is in for tough days ahead.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Siddharth, there are 2 possibilities. First, this is just catharsis for the Hindutva fanatics before the development agenda kicks in. Once the development agenda kicks in, there will not be any opportunity for these zealots to vent out their anger. Second, this is the thunder before it rains Uniform Civil Code. We will only know after BJP achieves its goal of a majority in the Rajya Sabha.

                            what is new in it? during election also there was no concrete stand from Modi on any matter of national importance. Only on the basis of so called Gujarat Model he won the election. Unfortunately no one knows what Gujarat Model is  but fools believed in it. He is an RSS fellow, his agenda was always clear. By 2018 if he cannot achieve anything substantial then he will lean more on communal agenda to get the vote. Mark my word Nano Brigade. namo Bhakat

                            the Prime Minister is between the deep sea and the devil!He actually rode the tiger to come where he is, and now he realises perhaps that he has bitten off more than he can chew. Be that as it may, the real suspicion is whether Modi who was not the first choice to lead the BJP in  the elections in the first place and had a host of detractors, now is getting back a bit of his earlier success. There seems to be  too much of a" orchestrated" midsummer madness in the present chorus of Hindutva. Is it the curse of a successful drama or just sheer vendetta.

                            overall correct analysis by the author. One thing that needs to be mentioned is that Modi himself is no stranger to hate speeches. His Gujarat Gaurav yatra had plenty of those. So it is not reasonable to expect a man to condemn something which he has himself done so often in the past. I am also afraid that if the "acche din" do not materialize, Modi might unmask himself and then it will be Godhra all over again. But even if acche din do materialize, RSS will be allowed to spread its slow poison in society.

I use to read almost all your opinions/articles, however now a days I have stopped reading you editorial. The common thing in all your writings is largely negative stance against the PM. Though I understand there are issues and you a writng on those, but there are also a lot of good things done by this govt, why can't yo write on that. it will spread a lot of positivity.

                            Sang Parivar need to think higher than converting a few to Hinduism through some ritualistic act. Hinduism accepts forms of prayers from sitting still and meditating to rolling around the temple and many other forms all with a intention to reach and realize Him. As far as Gods, we have a lot that projects his many qualities, some narrow, and some totally universal. Its the theocratic concepts in the religions that tend to convert and brain-wash others to believing that there way is the only way, their concept of God is the only god, there way of living is the only right way of living, and we should all show solidarity to our fellows of same religion how ever brutal and senseless they may be - kind of middle-age conqueror concepts that go against any free society let alone Hindus whose ultimate goal of life is to gain knowledge and be liberated. We need to think about these theocratic concepts, rid our society of these and embrace everyone from all religions as our own. Sang Parivar can show through their actions and practices like Yoga, any religion which is not free thinking and liberating is a theocracy and such concepts are totally out of date. They could use their strength to do more all inclusive acts and invite all than targeted acts. Hopefully we will become a real Sang Parivar by being pan-indian and even further enhance our society.

                            Agree that, lots of insane comments, and irresponsible statements from (BJP) MPs, have spoiled name. But to expect any PM to scold them in Public is little too much. What strategy they have (if they have) will always remain guess work, but no one will discuss internal matter openly, not even in any company or institutes. It has to be sorted out internally only. And while one is entitled to have opinion, crossing it over to Advice is stretching little too far. If you can't observe limit, then it's difficult for people from rural background. won't you agree? So try to keep your article to Opinion only. Free ki advice toe wife bhi nahi sunti... aur Husband toe vaise bhi (kuchh) nahi sunte!! Isn't it?

                            I did not vote for BJP.  But I had hope that if Modi becomes PM, there will be growth(not development) in the country.  But last seven months have again and again proved that Modi is not capable enough to initiate economic reforms or social reforms.  Game plan may be to consolidate vote of Hindus for the next election. Even if vote percentage decreases by 4 to 7% due to shift of votes of those who want development, chances are that Modi ji will win  2019 Lok Sabha election with somewhat smaller majority.

                            Modi has been silent on many issues. In fact he never says anything or not much when there are ceasefire violations, and soldiers die. <br/>
The Laxmanrekha of course is meant for while the parliament sessions are on. He didn't mean after that. <br/>
It will continue in this vein and can only become more potent as time passes, and Modi who was made PM by RSS and the sangh parivar support behind him cannot do much about it nor does he want to as he belongs to the same ideology.

                            Modi govt must answer where is the development -which brought him in clear majority here?<br/><br/>
Dividing the country in name of religion and hurting everyone with hateful speeches and even worse law and order situation should be the first thing Modi tackles as the strong man that he claimed to be-If he cannot control his own unruly ministers -can he control anything else?<br/>
Shameful..<br/>
It seems we don't need Britishers to divide us anymore-we know how to do it very well

                            First ask them to vote for him. You can't expect him to go against his core constituency. He or any of the others you mentioned are not hurting anyone.

                            Govt. proposed an anti-conversion bill just pass the damn bill and move on. Haven't these people had enough of religious discussion in the parliament since 1947 ? Now concentrate on economy and governance for once.<br/>
This conversion bill will prevent any forced conversion even the ones like in kerala and orissa which opposition doesn't wanna talk about as in that case majority community is converted into minority.<br/><br/>
Interesting thing is the name  " ghar vapsi ". My question to mr. Vardhrajan is why this name ? Do you know ? My guess is you dont because you were sleeping when the conversion was happening and you suddenly got active when it was time of reeconversion. (i dont support both of them but i hate hypocrites)

                            I regret voting these idiots. I think it is time now we should start thinking beyond BJP &amp; Congress.

                            What do you have to say about decades of accommodating the "cultural agenda" of the Leftists-Marxists? OR what about the "secular" appeasing of the likes of Owaisi, Jamaat rallies in West Bengal supporting Bangladesh extremists, or Geelani? Despite what you are desperately trying to say, communalism in India has existed for long, long before Modi or the BJP came to power, and it is only because people of your kind preferred to play minority politics, or chose to keep quiet because it suited your ideology that India is today facing a secular vs. communal divide. Stop being such a condescending know-all, Mr. Varadarajan. You are as much a cause for this as Adityanath is. You are not in anyway better than these people. You are as hypocritical as them.

                            Don't know Modi's Lakshman Rekha enough or not but know for sure The Hindu management's Lakshman Rekha and the punishment for the persons who cross it appears adequate.
