Headline::::Mani-Talk: Don Quixote Modi and His Sancho Panza, Arun Jaitley



DateTime::::2015-01-19T14:33:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)I write this from Colombo where I have arrived in the aftermath of an extraordinary election that has seen the largely unanticipated exit of the Strong Man of Sri Lanka, former President Mahinda Rajapakse, a kind of Sinhala version of our own 56-inch wallah, Narendra Modi. The two men share much in common: a public image of decisive leadership; a great oratorical talent; mesmerizing charisma combined with a dismissive attitude to precedent and procedure; a penchant for centralization; an autocratic bent of mind; a passion for building a personality cult; megalomania joined to paranoia; an unwillingness to listen to contrary advice; a predilection to play on societal divides for political advancement (and a preference for throwing shawls around their shoulders as a fashion statement). Where Modi talks of "development", Rajapakse talked of "infrastructure", both men believing that the invocation of the word would feed the general desire for palpable progress. In Rajapakse's case, there was the actual achievement of the agenda; with Modi, we yet have only words, slogans and one-liners. But the cautionary tale is that if Rajapakse's nation-wide network of excellent roads and railways did not quite impress a non-gullible public, Modi too will discover in good time that a bullet train from Mumbai to Ahmedabad is not going to impress the electorate as "development". Modi will also discover, as Rajapakse has, that favouritism in channeling enormous investment, such as the Chinese-built port and a flashy new international airport to his home-town of Hambantota only stoked resentment elsewhere; even so will the privileging of "Vibrant Gujarat" over other States be perceived as discriminatory mollycoddling.   Sri Lanka has very impressive social indicators - health and literacy rates are the highest in South Asia and akin to those of fairly high- income countries. Sri Lankans, therefore, expected social progress to accompany economic growth. The emphasis on "infrastructure" meant, however, the relative neglect of the social sectors. This rebounded on Rajapakse at the polls. Modi too is going to find that "development" has little appeal unless it is development at the grass-roots. The way his government is going around throwing environmental regulations to the winds and amending labour laws with the interests of capital alone and not the working class in mind, is bound to result in the alienation of those who are unemployed. Modi's belief in big business private enterprise is going to translate into jobless growth as private enterprise discovers that, through hi-tech labour-saving devices, productivity per unit of capital can be vastly increased with no increase - indeed, a diminution - in the overall wage bill. What Don Quixote Modi and his Sancho Panza, Arun Jaitley, have done tilting at the windmills of the 2013 Land Acquisition Act, which they supported in the last Parliament, is a striking example of leveraging the real estate mafia at the expense of small landowners and the marginal or landless labour that works these small plots. Rajapakse was confident of his rural base. That has been substantially eroded because the benefits of "infrastructure" did not reach down to the rural garib.  Similarly, the protection that the Land Acquisition Act gives this vast segment of the electorate is being snatched from them by the BJP government. The rural masses are already sharpening their claws in preparation for electoral revenge.  Rajapakse thought he could appease his rural Sinhala voters by keeping ethnic tension simmering while repeatedly calling attention to his military victory over the LTTE. Modi thinks that by keeping the communal pot (and differences with Pakistan) simmering, while repeatedly calling attention to his huge electoral victory, Hindus will see him as the savior even if Muslims turn from him, even as the Sri Lankan minorities - Tamil and Muslim - turned from Rajapakse. Indeed, the Rajapakse regime imitated the Modi regime by turning a blind eye towards a section of Buddhist monks provoking attacks on Muslim mosques. But the secular electorate sees through such games of narrow, divisive self-interest. Hence, Tamils and Muslims came out in huge numbers to join the large numbers of Sinhalas who wanted an end to ethnic tensions and the beginnings of a true dialogue on reconciliation.  Modi will come to the same pass since he is instinctively disinclined to rein in his fringe - for the good reason that he himself has risen from that fringe and, at heart, belongs to it. Modi, like Rajapakse, believes in himself - and only himself. Centralised administration, ruthless authoritarianism and massive self-promotion have the short-term advantage that all the credit goes to the One and Only, while dissent is stifled for fear of exclusion from the inner circle. Apparent success - infrastructure in the one case and MoUs in the other - reinforce and validate the Leader's sense of his indispensability. The future is hidden from vision because no one dare tell the Emperor that he is wearing no clothes. In Rajapkase's case it has been the hilarious story of his much-trusted astrologer who not only enthusiastically endorsed Rajapakse's confidence in his inevitable victory, calling elections two years in advance of the stipulated term, but also advised him on the specific minute - 1.04 pm on 20 November 2014 - as also the particular direction in which he should look as he signed the papers calling the election. Now that Rajapakse has suffered a crushing defeat, the astrologer (who has lost the keys to his official car and has been kicked out of his government bungalow) cries that even Nostradamus was not always correct, and he actually knew Rajapakse faced inevitable defeat but dared not tell him so for fear that he too would be thrown in jail for warning of defeat as his predecessor astrologer had been for wrongly forecasting that a previous election would be lost! Prof. Archie Brown, emeritus professor of the University of Oxford's The Myth of the Strong Man has been making waves in academic circles since its publication a few months after Modi came to power.  Prof Brown argues that true leaders are "inspirational leaders" who do not require public office to make for revolutionary change. "It would be hard to think," he says, "of a more politically significant example of an inspirational leader than Mahatma Gandhi, though he never held governmental office." Challenging "the widespread belief that strong leaders - meaning those who dominate their colleagues and the policy-making process - are the most successful and admirable," Brown shows that it is "the most cooperative leaders who have the greatest impact." It is a lesson that Rajapakse failed to learn. It is a lesson that Modi is constitutionally incapable of learning. It led to Rajapakse's downfall. It will lead to Modi's downfall.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            And you think that Mr. Rahul Gandhi or Sonia Gandhi are "true" leaders by your definition? <br/><br/>
Stop spewing venom Mr. Aiyyar. India has spoken and you have lost. Modi may have 100's of limitations, but he is indeed a good leader. If a party like BJP can come to power in 2014, it was only because of his leadership. <br/><br/>
Also, if you noticed recent news, Modi government had some role in dethroning president Rajpaksa. As far as foreign policy is concerned this government, unlike UPA, is not running like headless chickens.

                            Oh! congress needs your talent in Delhi and not writing on the media. go become the CM candidate in Delhi and prove your ability to win for congress for Delhi elections. Else keep quiet. you have more knowledge which is relevant only to the books with no practicality. you are scared to challenge Saudi Arabai to become a secular state and scared to tell all muslim nations to adopt secularism and democracy and declare all religions are equal. go learn practical knowledge sir and not bookish congress knowledge. Please help Rahulji at least by you becoming the CM candidate of Congress and winning Delhi and proving to Rahul that you are better than a column writer. If you cannot please stop writing in Columns as you are columns is not taking India nor congress anywhere. Why did not you with all knowledge have the courage to lead congress and be the PM candidate of Congress and fight against Modi in Varanasi. Aravind Kherjiwal is more braver than you sir. So sir, please get some true knowledge and not bookish Congress knowledge for better ment of India, congress and more importantly yourself.

                            MSA: I will give you a small example.  Gurgaon Jaipur highway was a mess pre MAY 2013.  For 10 long years nothing happened.  Today in JAN 15 most of the highway is complete with few pockets left.   Instead of running to Colombo &amp; writing what's not right, travel within India to see what has been done in 8 months of Modi sarkar.  You need a reality treatment within India.

Do you remember your arrogant prediction that "Modi PM nahin banenge, nahin banenge, nahin banenge" similar to your master Mr.Vadra's "Are you serious, Are you serious, Are you serious"?<br/><br/>
Well, Modiji has become PM now, so what are you going to do about it? And one more thing Mr.Aiyar...Modiji will be seated next to Presidents Pranabji and Obama this Monday at Rajpath, while you watch him on TV...am sure you will be delighted to see that!! Please do remember to have a cup of tea...Ha Ha Ha

It is time for Congress to do analysis on their failure instead of poking fingers at others.

                            Mr.Aiyar, I would request you to read about  Swami Vivekananda. Narendrabhai is a staunch follower of HIM. Swamiji was responsible for awakening the Indian masses for freedom, which I feel you sycophants in congress will never agree. Swami Vivekananda had always preached "One should believe in Thyself"coz each one of us are divine. You are just a mortal and always will be. You dont have any standing of your own. Your only way to be in the radar of the your Masters (the Gandhis) is 1) to wash their linen at home and 2) to do some Modi bashing. But we Indians are not going to take it anymore , you third rate anti national , ISIS- ISI- Al-Qaeda agent. <br/>
Get Lost from India coz You dont deserve to be here

Instead of  staying in tamilnadu to serve his constituency he  is travelling to usa and pakistan. Where did u get this money. Still congress can not digest modi as leader and write such article.

Modi is in power for the last 6 months while Rajpakse was in power for more than 6 years. Who can imitate whom? Mani will lead the rest of his life chanting Modi..Modi with zero effect.

Prof Brown argues that true leaders are "inspirational leaders" who do not require public office to make for revolutionary change.... Is this the reason Madam Gandhi and her son Pappu did not take public office.. Any case they have proved Prof Brown wrong - they cannot inspire anybody whether they remain in office or not.

                            This guy Aiyer does not even know what he is speaking. This shows that the chai wala comments did not come out of the blue. He is a habitual defaulter. His level is so low that he ends up in a default everytime whether it is the chai wala or Modi can never become a PM comment.<br/><br/>
What is this Land Acquisition Act all about. The rate of land has multiplied four times keeping it at par with the real market rate. 2. Minimum 70-80% consent of the land owners required to acquire the land. in 2013, when UPA got a feeling that they cannot come back to power in 2014, they designed this act thinking that : 1. they would send a message across to the farmers that the rate has been hiked four times and thus benefit the farmer. Secondly, Modi's main plank was development. For development you require land to be acquired at a faster pace. The 80% consent was introduced to stall the development as around 90% of the Indian public do not really understand the meaning of nation building / development. They are more centric towards their own pockets. So Modi if comes to power would not be able to gather the 80% consent and thus his development plank would fail and thus Congress would put pressure and call for mid term poll and come back to power. That was the reason why UPA did not allow the rajya sabha to function at all. what NDA did was to oursmart them by getting through the ordinance route. In this ordinance, they have just removed the 80% consent and kept the increased rate of land intact. Now is this not a justified move. You all think from the angle of nation building and not partisan politics.

                            The only sane attribute left with you is your command of the language and eloquence. I would love to see an article written by you on the brilliant Rahul . You would need permission to do this I presume. You are a sycophant to the core and go any lengths in making yourself left to look like a fool. Are you trying to question the wisdom of millions of intellectuals, presidents, parliamentarians etc who equate with the prime minister and his hard relentless work, discipline, austere lifestyle, morale boosting speeches. If it was so easy why do you not sermon Rahulji with your astounding brilliance. I am sure you are not wanted there.<br/>
Instead of making a mockery of yourself ( believe me its true), please do some introspection and you will in your heart of hearts know you are wasting your intellectual mind on betting on the wrong horses.Whatever you may say "The proof of the pudding , is in the eating"... Modi's pudding today is tastier ..... I am sure you know that.

                            Mr. Aiyar... the problem with so eloquent prose is that it gives us mere mortals an impression that many congressmen live a disconnected world of ludicrous privilege and alienation from the real world. Toning down the 'posh' english slightly might get you get better reach and traction with the masses.

                            I remember an old saying, 'People who cannot do, teach' in your case it is preach. That is what I am seeing in your case, Mr Mani. I realise that as a politician, that too from the Congress, introspection is not your strong suit. Following your tirade, I was more aptly reminded of a remote controlled govt by a Gandhi Quixote and her several chamcha panchos who turned a blind eye to the aspirations of millions of their countrymen, and refused to implement tough policies as appeasement politics merely to stay in power. I know you hate the PM deeply, but your nauseating megalomania is honestly much worse. Our PM Modi reached to this level not only with a blitzkrieg election wave but also due to the congress incompetency. People living in glass houses, should be better off with a scotch on the rocks, than with a rock in their hands. But please keep writing as I know this is your only source of livelihood.

If this is not reforms what is? Finally he has some bias against Gujrat and Gujratis. and on what basis and evidence he says "rural masses are sharpening their claws", god only knows. Finally by listening to all its Rajyasabaites the congress has screwed its fortunes and Mr.Aiyar wants us to listen to these same bunch of bafoons and link the fortunes of this country by following their ideas which have not given this country anything but poverty. please mr.Aiyar grow up. I am sure Modi is capable of controlling loose cannons in his party alas there are no leaders left in the congress who can control loose cannons like Mr.Aiyar

                            Not one commentator in this column has a reply to Mani Shankar Aiyar. Instead of rebutting him point by point the comments only attack him in vile terms, a hallmark of BJP supporters. Lack of even basic awareness is all too visible amongst the new "middle class". This group has become undeservingly rich and wealthy thanks to the liberalisation policies of Dr. Singh.  But what more can we expect from them; they behave true to their colurs.<br/>
Aiyar has forgot to mention the single important point, though he has indicated it in as many words. The majoritarian appealing streak of Rajapakse is strikingly similar to our "strong" leader.

                            please stop this Mad Man. I really pity his condition, does he not have a family who should get his treatment started.

                            The post shows how much Mr. Aiyer hates PM. Come On, you dragged India 10 years back. How could you even think that people would take your comments seriously?

                            Mr Mani remains a very dedicated Chamcha  of the family ! His so called intellect revolves around dreamy comments and sarcasm which he considers wit ! Some day he should realise that sarcasm is the lowest form of wit and he is a Ph.D in that area perhaps ! His party systematically ran the country into ground and till now they don't know what's hit them and they keep concluding all the wrong reasons why they lost out ! Keep it up as that helps the nation

                            This chap is a classical example of a  masochist. Getting beaten up week after week and coming back for more. He is in serious need of counselling.

                            The media is one which provides plot form to these obsolete  people who is neither contributors for nation building nor ethical in their behavior,just to remain in news and meet their selfish ends they write or talk some nonsense which is irrelevant for which coverage has been given, they always slaves of dynasty which have  leaders who are not capable to run a district level politics.
