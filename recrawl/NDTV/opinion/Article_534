Headline::::Why Farmers Have Every Right to Feel Gypped



DateTime::::2015-04-30T19:43:00+05:30




                                The latest brouhaha about land acquisition misses the main point. Why are the farmers up in arms? The 2013 Act/Ordinance is so progressive - it is good for the farmers and good for the government which must provide infrastructure. Why should any right thinking person be opposed to it? Why would any farmer be opposed to it?  
Well - there is the Act, and the Ordinance, and then there is what happens on the ground. But tell me: how would you (or I) react if we have been ripped off over generations? Well - that is what has happened to farmers over the generations.
There are two areas that have led to opposition, not just to the 2013 Act and the current Ordinance, but to any Act/Ordinance that seeks to take land away from farmers:
1.    The government's inability to pay compensation on time
2.    The inadequacy of the compensation.The government's inability to pay compensation on time
Let me give just three particularly egregious (out of probably several hundred) examples. We all know about the great dams at Bhakra and on the Damodar Valley. These were the great "temples of modern India" as Mr Nehru called them. I can't imagine that many know that those whose lands were taken from them are still waiting for compensation more than 50 years after their lands were submerged for your glory and mine! As The Telegraph, reported around five years ago "Descendants of evictees who had parted with their land to Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) - the first multipurpose river valley project of independent India - have come to the national capital to press for their unfulfilled promises of compensation and jobs. The evictees claimed that of 40,000-odd, only around 350 had been given compensation and jobs."
I would feel terrible if I were at the receiving end of this cruel injustice. What about you?But you may turn around to me and say: "Arrey bhai, that was in Nehruji's time - we are now in Modiji's time, when things move like a rocket." But do they?In June 2014, India Today writes about Sardar Sarovar (the title of the article is "Sardar Sarovar Project rehabilitation: Dam...Damned ...Duped."). The article talks about raising the height of the Narmada Dam by Mr Modi's government as a gift to his parched home state of Gujarat. And why should not one state help another - after all, we are one nation. But then the article goes on to refer to the shameful past and the likely-to-be disgraceful present and future. Here are a couple of extracts."A tribunal was set up that did not even visit the villages. The tribunal set up a number of rehabilitation principals with prescriptions from the World Bank. So on paper, a progressive policy was set up, but policy only remained on paper. There was a lack of planning, a minimum of five acres was guaranteed but never given.The issue is grave, because raising the height will displace 2.5 lakh new families, while the over three lakh already displaced ones are still languishing without any rehabilitation and any sign of hope fading away with every passing day."I would not like to be a member of one of those five lakh+ farming families who are uncaringly displaced from their land after centuries by heartless governments which have demonstrated little desire to fulfil their obligations. What about you?And look at the third and recent case reported this month in The Times of India which makes you want to cry and laugh - both at the same time!The gist of the case is: in 1998, the Railways acquired land from Mela Ram and Madan Lal to lay the Una-Amb track in Himachal Pradesh. As usual, the Railways adopted delaying tactics when it came to paying up. The farmers filed a case for enhanced compensation. After a fair amount of legal to-ing and fro-ing,  in 2013, the HP High Court directed the railways to pay the money within six weeks. "But the railways hasn't deposited the amount until now", the farmers' advocate AK Saini said a few weeks ago. Typical.So, on April 9, 2015, Mukesh Bansal, the additional district and sessions judge of Una ordered the attachment of the train if the railways failed to pay compensation to the two farmers!! The court said if Mela Ram and Madan Lal did not get Rs. 8.91 lakh and Rs. 26.53 lakh respectively, the train would be stopped at Una station at 5 am on April 16 and attached by it. The farmers were asked to select one out of four trains - and they selected The Delhi-Una Janshatabdi Express!Have you heard anything so ridiculous?I would not like to be at the receiving end of such callousness from the establishment. Would you?The inadequacy of the compensationThe grossly inadequate compensation has been written about for years. But things, it seemed, were getting better under the Act and the Ordinance. The compensation was a multiple of the value of the land. Fine. But which value and what multiple? Well - the multiple can vary by state, but can be as low as 1! And it was a multiple of the official, market value.One does not have to be a politician or a tehsildar to realise that the official market value of the land, as per land records, is a purely fictional amount, as almost all property transactions have a component of black money. Surely, that should not surprise anyone who knows that the black component accounts for anything up to a third or half of the white component in land and property transactions. So, the farmer gets diddled. But he hopes and prays that there will be a nice juicy multiple. As Alexander Pope wrote, "Hope springs eternal in the human breast"!But wait! There is a double whammy on the way! A short time after the land is acquired for an "official" price + a multiple, the government often goes ahead and changes the "land use" from agriculture to industry. And Shazam, what happens? The price of the land shoots up, God knows how many fold! If the land suddenly becomes more valuable (and the 'difference' sometimes goes to the greedy government, and sometimes to the friendly industrialist), should not the farmer share in the bounty rather than the government or industry keep it?Here are a couple of cases that demonstrate the fairness or the lack of it of our system.Just a month or so ago, a case came up before the Bombay High Court where the state of Maharashtra was pleased to sanction compensation equal to 1.1 times the "official" price of the land - forget the multiple of 2, 3 or 4, it was not even willing to give a multiple exceeding 1.1. And its reason? Would you believe it? The government claimed it could not afford it! So, we are saying that if the government is broke, a poor farmer should take a hit and subsidise the government? Ah, the fairness of it all."The state said the rise in the factor from 1 to 1.1 alone, last year, potentially meant a cost escalation of Rs. 5,700 crore for rural land acquisition since last January, a figure which the HC said was incorrect and "beyond comprehension", but one which cannot justify lower compensation to farmers."And the state of Maharashtra? Rather than accept the decision of Justices BP Dharmadhikari and AM Badar, it wants to appeal to the Supreme Court, enrich the legal fraternity and add to the great legal backlog. Also, now the poor farmer will have to find the resources to fight the mighty 'broke' government.I have rarely heard of anything so shameful. Have you?For the second case, let us look at the proposed Areva nuclear plant at Jaitapur in Maharashtra. This is a project to generate around 10,000 MW of power. Originally, it was thought that the power would be very expensive, but it was reported in The Economic Times in March, 2014 that "After three years of hectic negotiations, India and France have agreed on the cost of power that will be generated by Jaitapur Nuclear Power Plant (JNPP), clearing a major hurdle in the path of the project. The two sides have agreed on Rs. 6 per unit, down from Rs. 9.18 per unit quoted by the French company Areva initially, which was not acceptable to India, sources told PTI here."And what is the estimated cost of this project? According to The Mint, "The estimated cost of the project, to be developed by NPCIL, was around Rs.1 trillion in 2010, when a memorandum of understanding was signed between then French president Nicolas Sarkozy and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. French government-owned Areva is NPCIL's technology partner for the project."It took me some time to figure out how much a trillion is. But now I've got it. It is Rs. 1 lakh crore!The Jaitapur plant will be spread over 968 hectares. Now, what was the compensation offered? First, the government offered Rs. 2 lakh per hectare. Now that is what you call "the last of the big spenders". So, for around 1,000 hectares, the government would shell out Rs. 20 crore - that on a Rs. 1 lakh crore project! Then they upped it to Rs. 5 lakh and then to Rs. 22.5 lakh, i.e. Rs. 225 crore.  In other words, the final price that the government offered to pay is marginally over 0.2% of the cost of the Rs. 1 lakh crore project. Just see the venality of the powers-that-be. Doing their very best to squeeze the farmer.As The Mint  writes: "In February, the Maharashtra government, which is acquiring the land required for the Jaitapur plant on behalf of NPCIL, announced an enhanced compensation package of Rs.22.5 lakh per hectare for people losing their land.  Around 1,000 ha. of land has already been acquired for the project but barely 10% of around the 2,200 affected land owners have so far accepted the compensation package."If, as the report says, there are 2,200 land owners of the 1000 hectares of land, this means that the average holding is around 0.5 hectare. So, at the rate of Rs. 22.5 lakh per hectare, the current compensation per average land owner (who owns around 0.5 hectare) is around Rs. 11 lakh per farmer.Isn't it disgraceful that the initial offer (at the rate of Rs. 2 lakh per hectare) was an average of Rs. 1 lakh per farmer - to dispossess him and his (probably joint) family of their house and their means of living on a piece of land that his family has probably tilled for generations? And this shameful offer was made in your name - and mine.I have a simple question.If a project costs Rs.1 lakh crore, would it kill me if the cost were to go up by 2.5%(or even 5%)? Or, the agreed cost per unit is going to be Rs. 6. Would it kill me, sitting in faraway Bombay and having the Jaitapur electricity power my flat, if I had to pay 15 paise (or even 30 paise) more per unit, so that a farmer could get decent compensation? (I think that it would be less than 15 paise or 30 paise per unit, for I assume that the Rs. 6 per unit price includes the capital cost and the fuel cost).
Now, that 2.5% on Rs.1 lakh crore would yield Rs. 2,500 crore. From that amount, one could pay the farmers Rs. 1 crore per hectare (either in cash or as an annuity). The remaining amount could be used to pay the farm labour that will find itself out of an occupation, create first rate infrastructure - build schools, training centres, hospitals, etc. I think if the farmers were paid Rs.1 crore per hectare, not only would they willingly offer the land, but I can imagine that many farmers just outside the perimeter of the land acquired would approach the collector and tell him: "Collector sahib, you have made a mistake. My land is inside the perimeter and must be acquired!"Is that what we would like or would we prefer to impoverish the farmer? I'd much rather pay the extra 15 or 30 paise per unit than penalise an impecunious farmer. What about you?Many say that farmers do not want to live on the land as they no future there. True, and it is not surprising, seeing that the average holding in India is 1.15 hectares. Around 70% of the 90-odd million rural households have a holding of less than 1 hectare and 85% hold fewer than 2 hectares. Land holdings keep being sub-divided and uneconomical. True. Farmers want their children not to work on the land but go into other occupations, mainly urban. True. The answer is industrialisation and urbanisation. True.But the question is: how do we accomplish that shift? What can their children do in urban areas? What is their level of education? Pretty bad, as we all know.So, if the dispossessed migrate to urban areas, what will they do? Are there jobs in urban areas? How many jobs has industry created in the past few years - at a time when the country needs a million jobs a month? Will the movement from rural to urban India help them? Or will we create more slums, more social unrest, more urban unemployment and more crime? At least in the rural areas, they get something to eat, they have some form of shelter - so they eke out a living and, in recent years, rural incomes have been rising pretty fast.In the long run, the rural to urban shift has to be the answer but the nation has failed to provide a decent quality of education at a time when industrial jobs require at least some degree of literacy.But, in the meantime, do we stop building infrastructure? No. Do we stop acquiring land for roads and railways, for power plants, for defence and other 'public purposes'? Of course not.The question is: how do we compensate the farmers and the farm labourers and how long do we take before we pay them? You pay the farmer enough to get off the land and he will do so with alacrity. In recent years, there have been cases in Haryana, I think, where farmers have received significant compensation for their lands. In some cases, they have been given annuities (with annual increases) of around Rs. 30,000 per hectare per month for 33 years. It has to be a win-win situation. The farmers and the farm labourers cannot be asked to bear the entire burden for India's progress - particularly as they are relatively impoverished with not many options before them.But can the government take the farmer's land for a "public purpose" without his consent? Well, under the guise of the centuries-old English concept of 'eminent domain', it can. But we must bear in mind that this is the 21st century, where an elected government is dealing with an equal: a citizen voter, not a mighty, infallible Sovereign dealing with a groveling serf in the 15th century.This article is not an argument against the Act or the Ordinance or about the need to serve the "public purpose"; it is about fairness and justice to those who are asked to sacrifice for the "public purpose".Whether one is a communist or a socialist or a conservative or a fascist or a radical or a reactionary or a wishy-washy liberal (like I am!), I hope we can all agree that, while all of us want India to grow and prosper, "public purpose" is ill served if that prosperity comes at the cost of blighting the lives of large numbers of our less fortunate fellow citizens.(Dorab R.

                            Very well written article. We need more balanced articles like this. <br/><br/>
Also while Modi is trying to solve the problem, we dont need insensitive and irresponsible statements made. We need a wholesome solution to take India forward.<br/><br/>
Coming to the issue...farmers were committing suicide even before Modi came to power. So the status quo that existed before Modi became PM was unacceptable. If the govt. decides to delay the land bill, then opposition have achieved their goal (I am not saying opposition is right or wrong). <br/><br/>
Now if the land bill proposed by Modi is the best way forward and if the govt genuinely believes in this land bill, they need to take this forward present it to the people of India. Please do debates. Explain why this bill is important to the farmers and ordinary citizens. GOVT. OFFICIALS IF YOU ARE READING THIS, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE A STEP BACKWARD. Farmers plight need immediate attention. We to need to decrease the poverty amongst all Indians - including farmers and non farmers. <br/><br/>
Sorry for the long post, but, I thought this was a really informative post. This is one of the posts by a reader named Rajendra - buried in NDTV comments. "There are multiple statistics about the contribution Agriculture makes to our national income versus the people dependent on them. Agriculture's contribution to India's national income is not more than 15% where as 50-50% of our population are dependent on it. All over the world, Developed nations have no more than 8-10% of their national income contributed by Agriculture. And all Developed countries, not more than 10% of its population is dependent on Agriculture. Even china has moved massive number of its people out of Agriculture to other productive areas. Its a myth that moving people and reducing agriculture areas will reduce food production. US with less than 5% of population on Agriculture produces more than India. Agriculture Productivity has to be improved by using modern technology and not by having more poor people doing it. Moreover, we are staring at a human tragedy here which cannot be solved by putting more money behind bad policies. The average land holding of an indian farmer is not more than 3 acres. With such small lands, no productive, profitable agriculture can be done even if you pour tons of money. And remember, UPA was mauled because they tried to appease the farmers by doling out freebies like hike in Minimum support prices, which resulted in huge increase food prices and inflation. Profitable agriculture needs land consolidation and mechanised farming that achieves economies of scale and brings down the cost of production. Whether you are in earth or mars, the laws of economics dont change. The only way forward to avert a mass of population mired in poverty with no hope to escape out is to bring them to towns and cities and provide gainful employment that gives them cash in hand which they can spend. There are few things that government can look into like creating cooperative farming where the farmers come together to pool their land and outsource to professional agriculturists on a profit sharing formula. They themselves can they get employed else where to earn more money. But what will happen to landless agri laborers. For them, we need more industrialization, for which we need land. If people can read data and think, they understand the problem Narendra Modi is trying to solve. Hoever, Rahul Gandhi and his family believes in distributing poverty to all so then they can give bakshish to people like Rs.2/Kg of Rice, wheat and MNREGA labor doles of Rs.100/day. They know that only these kind of people vote for Congress. Those who escape to Middle class will never vote for Congress." I am sure if it is rational a majority of Indians and farmers will support this initiative. <br/><br/>
Jai Hind.

                            Excellent. Only 1 complain - why don'tyou write  about activists like NBA who stalled the project for decades resulting in sardar sarovar cost increasing by thousands of crores ! Why don't you mention that Gujarat govt were sucessful in doing their part of rehabilitation by it was MP (under Digvijay) which wasted away precious years ?<br/>
I want you to mention that only because you used the line - "will things will be different under Modi." If you are going to use it why not put the details that Guj Govt land acquisition model was lauded by the Supreme Court. Why not just go to sanand where land rates now are close to 1 CR per acre and most farmers there are now builders and industrialists themselves !<br/>
Please don't pin Congress govt's failures on people who have actual done something worthwhile.

                            i agree that farmers have to be given a fair treatment. No doubt. But should the third grade governance and policies of congress govt. in the past be used to malign the present govt, even without giving them a fair chance. Look all the corruption, ill treatment of the last 60 yrs is now being used by INC to attack the present govt [what an audacity]. How fair is this. INC is working tooth &amp; nail to block everything and wants the earlier policies to be followed. If the earlier policies were good then all ur example stand redundant else these policies need major change. Now people will decide if INC even deserved 44 or they have to be thrown out since they have only exploited poors for vote , nothing more nothing less

                            Amazing article. So amazing, I have to question its adherence to truth, but as I think further, it is likely the truth. Both Congress and BJP are selling out farmers. The designation from agricultural to industrial is probably what does it. I guess the Govt could assume the black component is 50% and pay at least 2x the typical sale value. Which political party is fighting for the farmer?

                            What a beautifully crafted article asking all the right questions! I agree with every single word of yours! its not about ordinance, we all need development but the govt. should make sure that the farmers are recieving their share (right amount of share!) of compensation and there should be a time limit to disburse the amount. If Modi govt can assure this not merely in words but in actions, then I am sure, a lot of farmers would be willing to participate in this dream of modern India.

                            Nice article! But, it could have been nice if the author comes with a solution. The land should be acquired from the farmer with his consent, the farmer wants his generation to shift to urban, the government needs land to create jobs. It seems it is a long loop to play around, but what is the solution then? BJP should understand that not all agricultural lands cannot be transformed to industries and congress/AAP should stop playing dirty politics by stimulating the farmers to blindly oppose land bill. After all, not all lands can be retained as farm lands, because the rate of agriculture and farmers are deteriorating rapidly.

Preparedness for natural calamities should be the top most priority of any government. Fund must be distributed adequately and one time. You cannot wait for farmers to suicide and decide what is to be done.

                            Excellent analysis . Agree with the point about compensation should be generous and on keeping with the size of the investment in the project. But all govts, congress or BJP, tend to get away with the minimum as the bureaucrats who handle the fine print still have a colonial mindset and air of superiority over the rural populace

                            Excellent. Very well put across. About compensation to farmers, they have been cheated all along. Too little is paid by way of compensation. However, more importantly it's their consent to sell that should be an even bigger consideration. Even if some may agree to sell land at a particular site, some others in the same location may not want to. Such people should have the choice to refuse. Forcing them would be akin to evicting us city dwellers from our flats or bungalows. Love for your own little patch of land is the same for all.

                            Don't be naive, Mr.Kabir. Governments come and go. Meanwhile, poor farmers have only seen cheating and forcible eviction for 60 years or so. Now you are asking them to trust the Modi sarkaar just because somebody else was in power earlier? Would you, if it was your land being seized? At the minimum, before asking for 'trust', wouldn't you say: first show us your good faith by paying up all the past arrears, with interest, then we will talk? This bill, by the way, is even more draconian than the Congress ones from the past! - Prasad

                            excellent writeup! Congrats and many thanks to Dorab. Really puts things in perspective. I think this article shows why the consent clause is so important. There are so many traps in the land acquisition process that consent is of critical importance, otherwise a lot of farmers will just be short-changed, as has been happening for a long time.

                            A very good and balanced article. NDTV should publish only similar balanced articles in all other areas, instead of publishing articles from people with vested interest which are generally one sided and unbalanced and that makes it a pain for the readers and it becomes a waste of time.

                            An exceptionally well written article. Thank you! I am appalled to learn that the Bhakra Nangal project which we learnt about in school has yet to compensate the poor farmers that it had displaced. <br/><br/>
All that you have mentioned in your brilliant expose only vindicates one point: the governments of the day do not care at all for the people whose servants they are supposed to be. The people are only of use to these scoundrels once every five years. <br/><br/>
I wonder if you or any of your readers can suggest how we can force the government to pay the fair price that you are referring to within a time-bound, verifiable manner? Can not doing so be made a criminal, non-bailable offense? Can the minister(s) concerned - and not just some poor bureaucrat- be jailed? If so, what is the way to do this? Please advise!<br/><br/>
Keep up the good work, Dorab! Your article is one of the very best that I have read on this site in the last several years. It would do justice to a piece in "The Economist", too! Well done.

                            This is a nice article and focuses on the issue. However, am wondering if you increase the land price too much, you might end up having a major increase in cost of land and end up in a housing crisis as land prices start going through the roof? Or you may end up with a lot of violence, forgery and so on as people lay their eyes on land? Or you may end up with people just holding land for the sake of it and not farming? Just wondering ...

                            This article is really a good analysis of the problem.  But as always there are 2 sides to the coin.  If 20000 families suffered due to the development work if 1 million benefit then the need of the hour is not to stop the development work but to find a solution to take care of the 20000 families. Even assuming the government or the corporate sector is willing to pay a higher price the ultimate farmer does not get that as in our system there are the middlemen who enrich themselves at the cost of these poor farmers.  So whether the land bill is passed or not the farmers are likely to suffer.  The solution lies in not just providing them with one time compensation but a sort of guaranteed annuity and in addition to ensure that the compensation reaches the ultimate beneficiary the government or industries have to be made to settle the compensation prior to acquiring the land and this could be by having the CAG or a national authority certify that the compensation has been given prior to start of the project

                            Mr Sopariwala as always has brilliantly made it so clear how simple it is to do what the government wishes to do - the operative word is "fair" and any thinking citizen would say that's something every government in a democracy would do by any citizen.<br/>
Unfortunately as we all know thats not the case; governments typically have been for those who have by means fair and foul; mostly foul got "control" over the levers of power; that mostly means the bureaucracy; Mr Modi has shown some positive steps in dealing with this criminal lot but its something that will be a work in progress for quite some time; in the meanwhile there will be more Gajendras as the criminal elements in the polity go about their "work" in the absolute belief that redemption is far, far away. And why not?? Has a single bureaucrat or politician really been punished?? Look at the shameless way the politician from Goa who was recently sentenced continues to "hoodwink" the police and of course the others who have their sentences suspended at the earliest  and often times on the flimsiest grounds. Compare this with genuine cases where "suspects" are routinely incarcerated for years with no succor anywhere on the horizon
