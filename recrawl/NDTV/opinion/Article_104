Headline::::For Critics Of PM Modi's Lahore Stopover



DateTime::::2015-12-27T23:54:00+05:30




                                Friday December 25, 2015, Christmas Day, will long be remembered as a remarkable day of diplomatic development. A vast majority of journalists, political analysts and others may have planned a relaxed day to enjoy the festivities of the season. Not one, within and outside the political establishment, could have envisaged the delivery of a diplomatic coup by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. His spontaneous decision to "drop by" Lahore (enroute from Kabul to Delhi) to extend courtesies in person to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on his birthday set imagination and diplomacy to fire. It also breathed some positive energy into the stormy template of Indo-Pak relations.
The political moment mirrored the warmth of the winter sun when Prime Ministers Modi and Sharif hugged each other on Pakistani soil and walked hand in hand on the red carpet laid out for the event. Symbolism mattered, for estranged at birth, the relations between both nations have been more fraught than at ease. Such moments are few and far apart between the two neighbours. Over the past seven decades, suspicion and animosity more often have won the battle over amity and peace.
Which is why such initiatives, spontaneous and innovative, deserve celebration instead of mindless criticism. These can rekindle hope, no matter how momentary, instead of the obvious despair. Both Prime Minister Modi and Nawaz Sharif have with equal grace seized upon every opportunity presented thus far.
The cynics deride this unplanned visit to Lahore as a spectacle of little consequence. Their criticism is rooted in the past patterns of Indo-Pak relations. From cross border terrorism to ceasefire violations, there are many areas of conflict that often drive both nations dangerously, even close to the brink of war. A constant sense of deja vu permeates each time talks progress, only to have another ceasefire violation or terrorist incident occur. We articulate this concern and Pakistan seeks to drive the centrality of Kashmir to the negotiation table. Talks at various levels between both nations have often delivered little more than assurances that haven't been kept. Deadlock is routinely achieved and breakthroughs are both rare and short-lived. But does that mean efforts to seek peace should be permanently discarded?
Another criticism is that this visit lacked planning and hence no outcome can be achieved. Again the critics completely miss the woods for the trees. They under-estimate the role that personal equations between leaders play which often drive things ahead. For those willing to see, a pattern is obvious in how both leaders are personally driving the effort to improve relations, despite known risks. Events clearly confirm this.
The ball was first set rolling when Mr Modi extended an invitation to leaders of the region to attend his oath-taking ceremony in May 2014. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif responded by attending, ignoring domestic political risk at home. A short meeting the next day followed between the two leaders.
Within months, however, the proposed path to improving relations was blown to smithereens with ceasefire violations on the LoC. Incursions and terrorist attacks on this side of the border raised tensions between both countries. The SAARC Summit in Kathmandu officially brought little beyond a parting handshake between the premiers as they were returning home.
Yet both leaders kept up the effort to keep a line of conversation going between them. By mid-2015, Mr Modi and Mr Sharif had spoken on the phone at least once every month over the issue of evacuation from Yemen, Nepal's horrific earthquake; they exchanged greetings on Ramzan. In between, a box of sweet Pakistani mangoes sent by Mr. Sharif to Mr. Modi was a gesture to tone down some of the negativity that routinely exists.
This in turn set the stage for a meeting in July at Ufa on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit. In Ufa, the two leaders met face-to-face for the first time since the SAARC Summit in November 2014. A statement was issued that focused on terror and talks between the National Security Advisors of both countries were scheduled thereafter. The talks fell through and deadlock returned over the red line of Pakistan seeking to drag Kashmir in and involve the Hurriyat once again.  Contact between the nations and two leaders seemed indefinitely paused.
However, on November 20th, a brief "pull-aside meeting" directly between the two Prime Ministers (in the absence of any officials or aides) in the lobby at the climate change conference in Paris brought things back on track. Within days, on December 6, the National Security Advisors of India and Pakistan held a meeting in Bangkok and discussed a range of issues. This meeting was the direct outcome of the Paris meeting.
Immediately thereafter, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj traveled to Pakistan to attend the "Heart of Asia Summit" and also met with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. At the conference, she pushed for Pakistan to allow the transit of goods from Afghanistan to India through its territory and added that "the heart of Asia cannot function if its arteries are clogged."
That arteries were being unclogged was in full display on December 25 when Prime Minister Modi made the sudden visit to Lahore. The Foreign Secretaries of both countries are now expected to meet in January 2016.
No part of this implies that the past or our concerns have been ignored and discarded. It only affirms that despite their existence, efforts need to be made whenever and wherever possible, to try and normalize the relationship between two fraught neighbours. Undoubtedly the past, as well as other forces out to create impediments in this process, make any outcome uncertain. But the goalpost has to be constant - seeking to achieve permanent peace in the neighbourhood. Which is what both leaders are attempting.
In the meanwhile, here's a thought for those who stand to criticize this visit - in the words of inspirational author and founder of SUCCESS magazine (in 1897) Orison Swett Marden - "Don't wait for extraordinary opportunities. Seize common occasions and make them great. Weak men wait for opportunities; strong men make them."(Nalin S Kohli is spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Director of the party's Public Policy Research Centre. He is also an advocate and has extensive experience in media and education.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Modi represents India. Not himself. Hope you blind-bhakts realize that. <br/><br/>
Besides, there needs to be our flag and national anthem and a 24 gun salute when he lands. <br/><br/>
you would never understand the value of those because none of you guys fought for them. <br/><br/>
if you dont agree, check how the flag was hoisted upside down with Modi in the frame as well as how disrespected the anthem in Russia. <br/><br/>
I am not even going to mention the possible steel coup because it would make it too apparent that I hate that he is our PM. Looks like a thug with that trimmed beard!

                            I would prefer that PM of india should speak like a PM in sober language instead of PROFANE and VULGAR RHETORIC.you can criticize people but the language and polity must prevail.<br/>
Mr. modi spoke in Kabul against Pakistan in a caustic way among AFGHAN parliament like KEJRIWALL as jat knows no better unlike of PM.Mr.nwab sharif has never spoken against INDIA or Modi like that!LALU , KEJRIWAL should not be the example MR. modi follow , he should be following world leaders and class. in public,the sobriety and gace must prevail above all , no matter how much scthing attack you make.<br/>
after that NAWAB SHARIF invited him to his house and treated him with warm friendly cordial welcome must have PUT MR. MODI INTO SHAME !!! AS AN INDIAN,living in USA, I strongly feel that MODI SHOULD PERSONALLY APOLOGISE TO MR. NAWAB SHARIF FOR THAT. It's not easy to be PM in Pakistan and the more he would bash NAWAB SHARIF ,the more MODI will loose the ground as it happened in BIHAR. MODI LOST IN BIHAR FOR THE MUDSLINGING VILLAGE STYLE REHTORIC SPEECHES!<br/>
IF HE SIMPLY SAID "BJP would develop Bihar and uplift your living status";it would have worked like magic instead THEY SHOED BJP AWAY ! NO MATTER HOW POOR AND BACKWARD IS BIHAR,THEY HAVE SENSE THE SENSE BEING INSULTED!<br/>
I must mention that I have listened to ALL THE POLITICAL SPEECHES OF  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN US CONGRESS FOR 30 YRS(hard drive TB FULL OF WORLD LEADERS) BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD THIS MUDSLINGING AND PERSONAL ATTACK IN USA because public are very much educated and never like that. Some times off the cufff remarks are made by few, AMERICANS toe them out ! what happens in Indian parliament is a laughable CIRCUS PARTY !! INDIA IS  CIVILIZED OR NOT  WILL BE DETERMINED BY THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR!

                            There had been nothing that prevented the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan meeting one another. It had always been possible for the Prime Minister of India to meet his counterpart in Pakistan and vice versa and the time, venue and duration of the meeting of such meetings have always been decided with their mutual consents. This time, they decided to introduce a surprise element into it with an obvious view to create a sensation about it.  Then, where is the question of extraordinary brilliance of seizing an opportunity that came out of the blue?

                            Dear Mr. Nalin Kohli, i must remind your position on Pakistan when you were in opposition. Even during the Lok sabha election campaign, you people have lambasted the UPA on Ind-Pak relations. (1)When our jawans are being killed on border, how can we talk to the terrorist state? (2) untill terrorism from Pakistan doesn't stop, we should talk to them. (3)Our jawans are being killed on border and UPA Home Minister is serving Biryani to Pak envoy. etc. There are lot of comments to be said. Amit Shah's comment during Bihar election and sadhvis and swamis are telling anything they like to. But what changed the mind of Modi towards Pakistan? Why he became lamb from Lion? Pakistan ko unke he tareeke se jawwab dena hoga. Pakistan ko yeh love letter likhna bandh karo. What the clear example of double standard. Modi has lost the trust of the sensible people of India. He is followed only by Blind Bhakts.

What is next now. Ok you want improve relation with neighbors. What about Nepal? Nepalese suffering due to our policy. We are punishing Nepalese because they shed Hindu Rashtra and go for the Democracy. The Nepalese feel the Hindu Rashtra was a curse for them and hindrance to their development. My Question we are punishing Nepalese because they choose they shed Hindu Rashtra and Choose Democracy. The Nepalese suffering. There is huge Human Crisis. The Nepalese hating us. They are cursing us for our atrocities and oppression. Is it the way foreign affairs moving. The whole world and Human Rights organizations blaming us for Nepal Catastrophe. The Nepalese now seeking help from China. Sooner or later we loose our best friend to China. If they choose it will be difficult for us. Because Nepalese by ethnicity near to Chinese.

                            Wish Mr Modi all the best but two points:<br/><br/>
1. In the past, such goodwill/warm/friendly gestures have not had good outcomes; and<br/><br/>
2. Mr Modi is not anything if not naive<br/><br/>
Wish we could be more optimistic.....

                            Real intolerent people and media will critisize each and rverything Modi does. Modi is used to this type of tratment for more than a decade, he will continue to work towrds his goal as said elephent is not botheted by barking of dogs behind

                            EVEN THIS MOVE BY MODI CAN FAIL. NO LEADER CAN INSURE AGAINST FAILURE. BUT HOW HE OVERCOMES SUCH FAILURES SHOWS UP HIS LEADERSHIP AND STATEMANSHIP.

                            I think it is a good gesture by Modi. It is not equivalent to a official dialogue. Even in Indian politics, opposition parties attend ruling party members' family functions. But noone should be naive to expect end of terrorism by Pakis because of this

                            I agree with Mr Kohli. Opposition spokespersons come across as being lost for words in their response to these gestures of the govt towards Pakistan. They keep harping on the fact that they dont see a roadmap. In my view its this govt's prerogative whether or not it reveals the roadmap at this stage. <br/>
Personally I think having a point of contact with the Pakistani army had been a drawback of this engagement process which seems to have been addressed by having an army general as the Pak NSA. A more coherent roadmap is now possible since this govt would now be better aware of the Pak army's point of view and not just that of the civilian govt. Its important that neither the civilian nor the military arm of the govt should be seen to be losing face if these talks are to go anywhere

                            lot of Pappu Chamcha's trolling. Chamcha's / Chelas can never understand this masterstroke. As far as Kargil is concerned, it was due to a war monger Musharaff and Nawaz himself was caught unawares. And for LOC after Saree exchange, Pakistan has never cried fowl after such a strong retaliation by the Indian Army. Such strong reciprocal response can only happen under BJP and "chelas / chamchas" will never understand or acknowledge it, because the party of appeasers (congi) has never cared for India, and had been selling india's soul to fill personal coffers.

                            Very wisely written article by Mr Kohli which deserves all praise and appreciation and puts to shame all those anti national congress elements who have been so critical of this great feet of Modi diplomacy.
