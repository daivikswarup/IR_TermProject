Headline::::'I Apologise.' Ashutosh Tells AAP's Side of the Story on Farmer's Death at Rally



DateTime::::2015-04-23T20:14:00+05:30




                                Yes, I did say, "If something like this happened in the future I would ask Arvind to climb the trees and save the person". This became a big controversy and it ran as a headline on TV channels. This was an answer to a question which we were asked with a lot of contempt and sarcasm. A reporter had asked if Arvind could climb on an electricity pole, why could he not do so this time to save the farmer on the tree. I lost my cool and responded in a manner which I later thought was offensive and insensitive.
Believe me, it was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life and for all of us who were present at the rally. We all were very, very upset. It was very disturbing. And when we were told that TV channels had been relentlessly running how "insensitive" we all were, as we did not stop the rally after the accident happened, we did not know how to respond. This was the last thing we expected from the media. We were called all kinds of names. We were branded insensitive, shameless, devoid of an iota of humanity etc. We were shocked. What crime had we committed to deserve this?
It was important for us to get back to the media with our side of the story.  Sanjay Singh, Kumar Vishwas and I held a press conference in North Avenue. Kumar and Sanjay narrated the incident as it happened. Then I spoke and was asked that question above. I said what I should never have. I should have known, being a journalist myself, that it would be lapped up by TV channels and a serious issue would get quite another colour. That is exactly what happened.
I am not blaming the media, but I do think the coverage should have been a lot more sensitive. A man had died in the most unfortunate manner, but to put the blame on AAP and call us names was way off the mark. I was there on the dais. I was sitting slightly towards the back. Suddenly, I saw Kumar Vishwas get up and say that a man had climbed up a tree. He announced that if the man had issues or problems then he should come down and meet the Chief Minister. It would be sorted out.
When he got no response, Kumar requested the policemen standing near the tree to intervene. The request was made several times, but the policemen showed no signs of responding. Sanjay Singh also requested the police and when they did not move, our volunteers were asked to help. Four AAP volunteers rushed to the tree. They climbed up, tried getting close to the farmer and then suddenly we heard a commotion and realised that he had hung himself.
The policemen were still inert. Volunteers stood under the tree, holding an open sheet. The man fell on the sheet. Our volunteers immediately rushed him to the hospital. Two of our MLAs, who are attached to the health ministry, also went along to the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital.
The police response was baffling. It was a rally in which the Chief Minister of Delhi was taking part. As per protocol, a certain minimum arrangement was required. In the presence of the CM, repeated requests were made to the policemen to help get that man down from the tree. They are a trained force. They are professionally trained to deal with such situations but they did nothing.
In the absence of any action from them, our volunteers tried to save the man. These volunteers were not trained. They tried their level best, but unfortunately that was not enough. May I ask, is it not the duty of the police to respond to situations like these? Why did they not act despite the presence of the Delhi CM? Would they have done the same if Delhi was a full state and the police was working under the CM? Was it not open defiance by a disciplined force? Did they have some instructions from their higher ups?
Some people under the tree had been disturbing the rally right from when it began. When we got to know that a man had climbed up the tree, we initially thought it was one of them - a group of protesting temporary teachers - who was trying to draw attention. Even when the farmer fell on the sheet held below, we thought it was one of the teachers.
We got to know from the media that it was a farmer from the Dausa district of Rajasthan, who had three children and his crop had failed due to unseasonal rains. We were also told that he shouted anti-Modi slogans while on the tree. When he was taken to hospital, we were informed that he had suffered injuries but was alive. The information about his death came to us through the media. As we got the information we stopped the rally. But by then TV channels were asking:
1. Why didn't Arvind say anything to console Gajendra?
2. Why did Arvind not go in the crowd and try to save him?
3. Why did the rally continue after the incident?
Believe me, I am not making excuses. Kumar and Sanjay had taken the control of the stage and they constantly requested the police to save him. Both of them are top leaders of the party and in that commotion it did not occur to us that we should include Arvind and that he should speak. All his life Arvind has fought for the downtrodden. And now to assume he deliberately did not speak to Gajendra out of arrogance is not right.
May be Arvind going into the crowd to talk to him and counsel him could have been another step to resolve that crisis. But we thought that it might create panic and lead to a stampede. That would have been worse.
The rally continued because we were continuously under the impression that he had suffered injuries, but he was alive. And when we got the information about his death, we immediately stopped the rally. Arvind and Manish immediately went to the hospital.
In hindsight, may be Arvind could have made an appeal to Gajendra; he could have gone into the crowd and tried to talk to him; he could have stopped the rally. It might be an error of judgment on our part for which we should be criticised severely, but to think that we have become "arrogant" and "insensitive" is not right. Why would we not want him saved? We don't do that kind of politics.
It was AAP that had announced a payment of Rs. 20,000 per acre as compensation to farmers who had suffered crop loss due to rain. This is the highest in the country. It was AAP that gave one crore to each policeman who died on duty. Otherwise their families only got a sewing machine as compensation. AAP believes in a different kind of politics and people gave us a massive mandate in Delhi as people are fed up with Machiavellian politics. We are aware of our responsibilities and also of the trust which people have reposed in us.
Today we are very sad and disturbed that we could not save the farmer's life. I can't ever forgive myself, but let me also underline the fact that in the last three months, more than 600 farmers have committed suicide in Maharashtra and many more in other parts of the country. Unfortunately, these deaths could not become a serious subject of debate for TV channels. And despite these suicides, the Modi government is still adamant about replacing a farmer friendly land acquisition bill with a draconian one. Is there any lesson for us?
Don't you think that society at large has to introspect why even after 68 years of Independence farmers are still committing suicide? Why is this happening in a country which till very recently thought to be primarily an agrarian society? I have learnt my lesson and it was for this reason that I APOLOGISE for my statement and say SORRY.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            I am not getting words to call these AAP leaders. No shame at all.. Justifying their shameful acts. Even after farmer hanged himself, they continued their political talk. When he was committing suicide, they were announcing to not give attention to the farmer who was climbing tree. And farmer was invited to Delhi by AAP leader to make a drama, but shame turned tragic death by accident.

AAP's idea was to jump the bandwagon of land acquisition bill although its not their business right now. Once AAP was elected with majority I was seeing some hope. But all they have brought and perhaps will bring to the nation and Delhi is chaos, instability and unproductiveness. Shameful and disgusting!!

AK and henchmen will now try and cover up their complicity in this incidence and this will lead to further compromises in their governance.

                            I accept some good aspect of AAP's politics but sadly there have been some really saddening aspects too. Especially that they have focused on criticism based politics thriving a lot of negative and rebelling emotions among citizens. This is something not good for long term sustenance of a system and now since they have good majority, they should focus more on work rather than such provocative rallies.

One thing this Mr. group of rights does not write about is did they encourage that hapless farmer to jump by clapping and cheering. It is murder by the mass of AAP. If any humility left in these group of people they have to introspect what they are trying to do. Taking every issue to leverage their political power hunger dream. Instead of constructive suggestions what this party has is destructive hooliganism that's all it stands for

please see the following news report from todays Hindu  .. is this true ? then shame on you and your ilk !!<br/><br/><br/>
"As the rally progressed on Wednesday afternoon, 41-year-old Gajendra Singh from Rajasthan's Dausa district was first accused of being a "disruptive element" by senior party leaders, including Sanjay Singh, Ashish Khetan and Kumar Vishvas.<br/><br/>
"Who is this man?" asked Dr. Vishvas as he pointed at Singh perched atop the tree during what were to be the last eight minutes of the latter's life.<br/><br/>
"He is an agent of the Bharatiya Janata Party which has been on a campaign to malign the image of the AAP Government since it came to power two months ago," Dr. Vishvas said followed by Singh's fatal jump."<br/><br/>

                            Why give so much media coverage to people like Ashutosh, who don't deserve it. They are full of arrogance and smack of contempt for the common man. Please blackout people like Ashutosh, Raghav Chaddha and Ashish Khetan for some time. Probably they will use the black out time to learn some things like humility and come back as better media persons.

                            Ashutosh is unnecessarily blaming others despite the proof that AAP is totally responsible for this it is on record that this farmer was not in such a desperate situation that he will commit suicidei. He came to the rally after he was advised to come by Manish Shisodia. It appears they were planning some dramas of suicide, which went wrong. Gajendra had called his familly a few minutes before the incident to say that they will seek him on TV. Sure they had plans to do some drama. AAP hand a sinister plan of blaming Modi for farmers and Kejriwal continued blaming police as he thought that it is a drama going on per hisn script. But things had gone wrong and he had no idea. Kejriwal has prove had to be a worst kind of human being who will take advantage of even the death of some one for his political advantage.

                            You have depicted same sense of arrogance and insensitivity that Sheila Dixit and Sushil kumar shown at the point of Delhi "Nirbhaya" case. You can no longer hide behind the novice politician excuse as well.<br/><br/>
It seems like that power and that too of an NCT had gone into the head of Aam Aadmi party. Don't forget that it was plain arrogance that was responsible for decimation of Sheila Dixit and congress in Delhi even after she had delivered for a period of 15 years.<br/><br/>
Do some introspection if you want your political future to alst more than 5 years.

Being a media person/s you are most unfit to represent AAP on a media front. Faster YOU and AAP understand this FACT better for AAP.

                            "This was an answer to a question which we were asked with a lot of contempt and sarcasm". After such an incidence you think reporters were in a mood to trow sarcasms at you? How pathetic Asutosh. If a reporter ask a valid question that becomes a sarcasm and we must accept your answer as a reponse to this sarcasm. If a Modi says (out of sarcasm) that 15Lakh can be deposited into each account if black money is brought back. you can keep asking when will the 15 lakh come and gain brownie points.If he talks about 56inch chest you also keep questioning that. but no one should question you. Cant imagine that a 2 year old party, with people who were supposed to be humble aam aadmis are showing this amount of arrogance that even the age old parties will feel shy. Not to blame you. Sad that in this country there exist people with extremely low IQ and are easy to manipulate. You people just use them. Even more painful is that those people dont even realize this. Good luck Delhi

Please remember that negative media is AAP´s strength as proved by Delhi poll results. Please look after the family of the farmer.

Regarding Police insensitivity towards the incident, the blame game has started and Police blaming AAP volunteers for instigating the farmer, as if they were deployed there to watch the "provocation" and do nothing till further instructions from Center. BJP has started protesting in Delhi with banners and posters against AK...In totality, all the acts have really saddened India and feeling ashamed for these nonsense acts. Where does the "Deshghakti" go when we behave like this ?

                            Whole leadership of AAP failed. AK even has no common sense of stop speech and conclude rally in this situation. It was shameful to give speech and blaming police and do nothing themselves. It was hypocrite. Every one clapping. All who were present are guilty of sin and if AAP workers and AAP leaders are feeling guilty then there is difference between them and animal. AK should resign from CM post and elect someone else who is wise. <br/><br/>
Look at the donation level, No one is trusting AK anymore. <br/><br/>
He was ready to blame police right away but could not say anything about lost life in front of his own eyes. He even did not care to say until after 48 hours. He is unfit.  <br/>
AK was telling bad words about Manmohan sigh who was PM of Country and he still today very very very respected person and he is of totally higher class person than him. AK showed that he is not in that class and all he knows how to do cheap dirty politics to become hero in public eyes. He is just a white thug who has been caught several times but he still thinks he is the only honest person in the world.

Delhi people voted them in power to serve them rather unnecessarily organizing farmers rally to create chaos. they have unnecessary national ambition. there are so many bigger regional party in this country only protesting inside the parliament , not coming to street. what happened to AAP to organize this rally and how many farmers are there in Delhi. Mr. Kajri should serve delhi if they want to exist in indian politics.

                            Do not shed crocodile tears Mr. Ashutosh, this is a clear case of a strategy back fired, you really wanted that farmer to die so that other farmers will with you, without knowing truth but what happened was not really expected b AAP. Even at the time of LOKPAL BILL agitation, Kejriwal want Anna to die, so that he can gain form that.

                            We all thought Mango ( Aam) Man (Admi) party, has "Rejected Jurnos" and thuggish leaders !!. After seeing Ash Tosh "Performance" in your channel, one has to realize that Mango( Aam) Man ( Admi) party, ALSO has "Actors" !!
