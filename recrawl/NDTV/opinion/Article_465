Headline::::Bhagat Singh, India's Most-Beloved Martyr



DateTime::::2015-03-23T16:05:00+05:30



(Subhashini Ali is former MP, former Member of the National Commission for Women and Vice President of the All India Democratic Women's Association.)
	March is the month of the Martyrdom. India's most-beloved martyr, Bhagat Singh, was hanged at the age of 23 in the Lahore Jail on March 23 in 1931.
	His youth. His heroism. His unflinching, even welcoming, acceptance of the price he would pay for his thoughts and deeds. The amazing clarity and depth of his thoughts. All this and more have ensured that his memory, unlike that of many others, has not become one that is brought out of mental recesses once a year to be dusted and placed on a pedestal for a few hours of remembrance. His memory retains a brightness and sense of close proximity and each generation of young men and women discovers him with a sense of excitement and veneration.
	The dimensions of Bhagat Singh's thought and the depth of his understanding of social, ideological and political issues are amazing. His young companion, Shiv Verma, recalled never having seen him without a book in his hand. Every free moment would find him devouring books. He would absorb new ideas and then discuss them animatedly with his comrades. His reading not only strengthened his political understanding and commitment, it also wrought very basic changes in his outlook.
	In his seminal work written in jail, "Why I am an Atheist", Bhagat Singh writes: "I studied Bakunin, the Anarchist leader, something of Marx, the father of Communism and much of Lenin, Trotsky and others, the men who had successfully carried out a revolution in their country. They were all atheists...By the end of 1926 I had been convinced as to the baselessness of the theory of existence of an almighty supreme being who created, guided and controlled the universe... I had become a pronounced atheist."
	Bhagat Singh's studies not only made him an atheist but an ardent socialist as well. At a meeting of the leading members of his organization in December, 1928, after much discussion initiated by him, its name was changed to the Hindustan Socialist Republican Army.  This reflected how his definition of freedom now encompassed the establishment of a Socialist state in free India. He also recognized the importance of combatting casteism and communalism in order to achieve this.
	In the June 1928 issue of the periodical, 'Kirti', he published two articles, 'Achhoot ka Sawaal' (The Question of Untouchability) and 'Sampradayik Dange aur unka Ilaj' (Communal Riots and Their Solution). In the first article, he wrote "Our country is unique where six crore citizens are called untouchables and their mere touch defiles the upper castes. Gods get enraged if they enter the temples...We claim to be a spiritual country but hesitate to accept the equality of all human beings...We whine that the English do not give us equal rights in India. Given our conduct, do we really have any right to complain about such matters?"  He went on to say "If you (upper castes) treat them (untouchables) worse than animals, then they will surely join other religions where they will get more rights and will be treated like human beings. In this situation, it will be futile to accuse Christianity and Islam of harming Hinduism." What resonance these words have in India today.
	In the second article, he castigates the leaders of the national movement for compromising with the communal forces whom he identified as the Hindu Mahasabha and Muslim fundamentalists like the Tableeghis.  
	Despite the clarity of Bhagat Singh's thoughts and the fact that he wrote extensively about them, attempts have been made to distort them.  In an early film made by Manoj Kumar who also acted as Bhagat Singh,  he was shown singing "Mera rang de basanti chola" as he walked to the gallows. This was a complete falsehood.  All eyewitness reports confirm that Bhagat Singh and his two comrades shouted "Inquilab Zindabad" as they confronted death.
	The song in question has very strong political undertones. It resonates strongly with a mythic historical 'fact' that is repeated ad nauseam in various' histories' of medieval India. According to this, Rajput soldiers would tie saffron scarfs around their heads when they rode out in suicide squads against various marauding Muslim armies. It is interesting that a more recent and extremely popular film that intercuts authentic incidents from the lives of Bhagat Singh and his companions with the those of a group of young men who try to emulate them was named  "Rang de Basanti" (Colour It Saffron).
	Bhagat Singh's writings and courageous opposition to colonial rule, so different from the abject apology tendered by Savarkar to the British Government whose loyal subject he remained for as long as they ruled India, are proof of the chasm that separates him from the ideology of the Sangh Parivar.
	At a time when contesting narratives of the freedom movement  are making their presence felt more strongly than ever in the political arena,  it is  essential to remove the saffron scarf that has posthumously been placed around Bhagat Singh's proud and unbowed head.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Those who cannot free themselves from religion will also never have respect for humans. One needs free thought to understand and love humans.

                            I dont know where do people suddenly start springing up from and start writing articles about Bhagat Singh. Till last year March 23rd would be treated like any other normal day and I would feel very sad about it with nobody even mentioning about Bhagat Singh. This is the first time in my memory that a Central Govt is remembering March 23rd and we suddenly have people waking up from slumber and trying the claim their piece of glory by hitting out at RSS in the grab of praising Bhagat Singh.<br/><br/>
I feel Bhagat Singh would do very well without such articles coming out.

                            Its funny to see some desperate attempts to gain back the losing relevance.Yes Bhagath singh was a socialist but an Indian before that. Shaheed-e-Azam Sardar Bhagat Singh Museum in Khatkar Kalan, holds memorable belongings of Bhagat Singh, his half burnt ashes, the blood soaked sand and blood stained newspaper in which the ashes were wrapped and a copy of the Bhagavad-Gita with Bhagat Singh's signature. Hope One like Subhashini who took on word Saffron will surely suffer to explain the influence of Bhagavad githa in life of a socialist. We Salute you Bhagath, but not more or less to a lot others like Lala, Surya Sen,Chandrashekhar Azad. Hope Subhashini will remember their birthdays not, or wait till MODI pays tribute.. ;-)

                            Much like bhagat singh the commies of today study Bakunin,Marx, Lenin and Trotsky. Have they even tried to read a paragraph of the ancient texts of our land before rubbishing it? Sadly no. They suffer from a severe inferiority complex and any mention of our texts make them hide their faces under the pillow..

                            For close to 60 years, she &amp; her party did nothing on 23rd March. Now that a govt has finally decided to honor the dead and celebrate the day, these creatures of nowhere feel insecured. Suddenly she feels that using the word 'basanti' is incorrect. Had Manoj Kumar used the word, Green (hara), I am sure, she and her comrades (jokers) would have been absolutely fine.

                            Swami Vivekananda told "Religion means realization" In Hindu religion first ask yourself who are you??-- if anybody can get answer other than physical and social identity about him or her then he has understand religion -any lecture giving cpm or  any body can give on answer on it  in true sense then he is religion man or women in the society. Bhagat sing has understand it so we felt He was Hindu one script had written has implement it on His life to give India as exmaple for Mother land .

                            People like Bhagat Singh won India its freedom.  They paid the price with their lives.  Gandhi and Nehru were merely bit part players.  There is a myth prevalent in India that the Nehru parivar gave up all their possessions for a free India and that Nehru was treated harshly in jail.  Truth is that Motilal Nehru saw the writing on the wall and switched sides.  Prior to that Motilal was a loyal servant of the British Empire.  He even ordered a suit from London to wear for the 1911 Darbar in honour of King George V.  Jawaharlal frequently disappeared to Europe rather like his descendent Rahul Gandhi.  Jawaharlal's 'chintans' were also done in Europe.  Enjoying equal hero status to Bhagat Singh should be Udham Singh who was hanged in London following his assassination of General O'Dwyer, Governor of Punjab who was the boss of General Dyer, the character who ordered the massacre in Jalianwala Bagh.  Today, you will find nothing honouring such heroes but the nation is full of monuments, streets, universities and projects named after the Nehru parivar.  The bottom line is that India did not really obtain freedom on August 15 1947.  All that happened was that the British left and the Nehrus took over and what a disaster that has been!

                            Written through Communist glasses. Bhagat Singh remains India's Eternal Hero. He was a Patriot who died tragically young. Do not impose your views and ideas on him.

                            It is a shame that people like her are playing politics in the name of martyrs &amp; freedom fighters by pitting likes of Savarkar &amp; Bhagat Singh. Would Bhagat Singh approve of CPM aligning with extremists like Madani in Kerala. Stop trying to make mileage out of our national icons. Stick to your staple like Mao &amp; Stalin...

                            Religion is personal and a Spiritual path that should do not be mixed in our social interaction. We need to respect others self space as much as we expect others to respect our space.
