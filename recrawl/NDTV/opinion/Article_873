Headline::::You Can Call Me Pseudo-Sickular



DateTime::::2015-10-11T11:42:00+05:30




                                So I am a beef-eating Hindu Brahmin, married to a South African of no religious affiliation. I am a trained Bharat Natyam dancer and I also love hip-hop, belly-dancing and jazz ballet. I studied Sanskrit and Tamil as second languages along with Hindi which I still struggle to speak with correct grammar and pronounciation, making English my first language. Tamil is my mother tongue. I love Yoga, I love chanting Sanskrit shlokas but over and above all of that, I am a woman and an Indian.
My culture - and I mean mine personally - is one of lovely contradictions. No one can tell me I am not Hindu. No text can tell me how exactly to be one. No, the Ramayana is a story, not the "Word" like the Bible or the Quran. In fact, I prefer the Mahabharata any day. My mother is a pure vegetarian, my father is not. He taught me that the sunrise, a little bird song, a tall tree are all God. He taught me that the observer, me and the observed, the universe are intimately entwined. He taught me if we do not see ourselves in others, then there is no beauty to being human.
So when dangerous nitwits try and circumscribe me into narrow boxes with their filtered jingoistic take on Hinduism, it makes me wonder what kind of people they are, and do they even see India the way I do? Let me say that I am not going to romanticize my view of India. I see the poverty, the helplessness, the garbage, the corruption, the violence. I wake up to stories of an old Muslim man killed by a mob on the suspicion he was eating beef. His younger son was also beaten badly. His older son is an engineer in the IAF. I wake up to news that a khap panchayat, that lovely bastion of patriarchal kangaroo court justice, ordered the rape of two sisters because their brother married outside his caste. Caste. Paint it whichever way you like, it's a sick degrading practice, as much an apartheid as the old system in South Africa, the country in which I now live. I have seen more racism in India than I have here in South Africa. I was called a "madrasi" casually by people who would be shocked if you told them they were parochial idiots. I have alternately been asked how I am not dark as all madrasis are and also been told by an acquaintance that her summer holidays made her as dark as me. On work for a shoot at the Taj Mahal, the ticket window guy argued that my camera person had to pay the foreigner rate because he was Korean. My camera person was from Manipur. I was flatly told we were lying as Indians did not look like him. It's not just North India but also South India that has all these issues. So, no, I have no romantic view of India.
But I have also seen another India, travelled in it, lived in it, been told stories about it. In that India, I have been fed without having to ask, been welcomed without questions, seen unbelievable dignity in the face of all odds. I remembered a story of how the great Bismillah Khan was once on a train and when it stopped at a station, he heard a most haunting melody, a raga he could not identify. It was a young boy walking through the train playing the flute. He stopped near the ustad, and the ustad was mesmerized by the tune. And just as suddenly as the boy came, he left. The ustad was convinced he had been in the presence of divinity. He swore the young boy who played for him was none other than Lord Krishna. Ustad was on his way to the kumbh mela to perform, in a profoundly Hindu festival. When he did perform, he played the raga he heard the boy play and that raga was called Kanhaira by him.
My Hinduism is simple. It is "aham brahmasmi" or "the core of my being is the ultimate reality, the root and ground of the universe, the source of all that exists." There is only one supreme being and it is the super consciousness, from which we all sprang and into which we will all be absorbed. Just as a seed carries the secret of a mighty tree within, we carry the supreme conciousness. When that is the central philosophy of Hinduism, where the microcosm and the macrocosm are linked in an infinite beautiful cycle, how can I ever accept what the extreme right wing would like to see as Hinduism? When Hinduism, a way of life, a philosophy that roots itself in a bedrock of tolerance, is twisted into narrow rules and regulations trapped by bars of hate, I cannot and will not accept it. When my Hinduism, asks me to believe in Athithi devo bavah, or "the guest is God", when it asks me to find God in myself because tatvamasi is the heart of the matter and therefore makes me find the divine in others, how can the rule makers separate us into individuals instead of humanity? My Hinduism is stories I danced to. When Bhakt Jayadeva wrote the Geeta Govindam while writing of the love between Radha and Krishna, he spontaneously composed a line, "dehi pada pallava mudharam" or "Krishna asked Radha to place her lotus-like feet on his head." Appalled by this thought that had come to his head, Jayadeva left the house to go bathe and clear his thoughts. A few minutes later, much to his wife's surprise, he came back and sat down and wrote and left again. A few minutes later he came back again. He sat down and then with great anger asked his wife how she could have written the words that were such an insult to God, his wife, most puzzled, said that he himself had just come back and written them and that's when Jayadeva knew it was Krishna himself who had done so. God was saying that in the presence of love, even God is the lesser. Yet, today, we hate, hate so much. That is not my Hinduism.
In our culture we will ignore that Charvaka is an ancient Hindu philosophy that embraces philosophical skepticism and rejects the Vedas, Vedic ritualism and supernaturalism. It encourages questions and arguments. Established by Brihaspati, one of our most venerated sages. Yet we will murder professors and social workers who subscribe to it. Our Gayatri mantra, asks for the benevolent light of the sun, the life giver, to inspire our intelligence, to inspire our understanding and to banish ignorance and bathe us in enlightenment. Where is any of that now? In our culture, we will ignore that all meat was consumed by Hindus in the Vedic times and erase that part of history. Indeed that over 60% of India eats meat is rejected. I reject that Hinduism. That narrow confined box.
You can call me a pseudo sickular liberal presstitute. I will just bow and say namaste, which means "I greet the divine in you".(Swati Thiyagarajan is an Environment Editor with NDTV)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            What happened to that liberal value of seeing the divine in animals? Is that not part of your 'Namaste'? What about PETA Tthat asks for mercy on animals? No saffron group runs it. How many PETA activists get thrashed, no hue and cry about it. Yes this is is a land of contradictions. Btw, Hinduism asks for non violence against all life forms and esp animals not just the cow. It asks humankind to use the least for sustenance i.e. plants. Cow is given a special status of divinity as it provides so much for a family and thus given status of 'Mother'. Such is the divinity in my Hinduism and whatever arguments you present will be self destructive when an erudite scholar comes and reasons with you, but won't as it will be futile. No text can tell you how to be a Hindu but a Guru can and I am not asking you to seek one.

                            We bhakths call your friends as pseudo-secular presstitute NOT because they do or do not eat beef but because of the selective outrage that your friends often express. You remain quiet when the worst tragedies of ethnic strife descend on a community or at the most express only marginal "I condemn it"s. Yet you go on the streets with petitions , letters to the UN, you run to President Obama asking a democratically elected CM to be denied a visa, you return awards even if ONE or two persons rom another community get unfortunately lynched. Your passionate activism is asymmetric, hence the term pseudo-sickular. We don't need lessons on how much Hindu dancing you do or how much beef you eat. Just be fair to everyone - that's all!

                            I am not sure what point you are trying to make. No body has called you pseudo -secular. The pseudo-secular are those people, who consider that Hinduism is not bogged by dogmas but other religions have a right to be bogged by dogmas in India. Pseudo-secular are the people who oppose abolition of 4 marriages in a particular religion. Pseudo-secular are the people who question 'ghar wapasi' or conversion to Hinduism but do not question conversion to another religion. Please do not strengthen such people.<br/>
Please try to answer why this country has been divided earlier based on religion. Please answer why some people want J&amp;K to be out of India by religion. Please answer why India can not have uniform civil code. Please answer if we are a secular country why we different religions have different law. Please answer whether a christian can ask to follow a common civil law in India and not christian civil law.<br/>
Please look into these tough questions. Please do not be fashionable secular.

                            So you mean to say that you are some super intelligent pseudo secular whose stated or perceived opinions should be accepted by others.  Were you alive in vedic times? and why meat eating or beef eating makes you so great?, do you have some divine perceived right over other living beings on planet and if yes who has given you this right.  You are a scam artist environmentalist who may write at times to gain sympathy for a lion or crocodile but then who gives you the right to eat other living beings?  Then who is stopping a powerful human from eating other human.  Cannibalism, you know, may be only laws.  So if a group of society is against something, who gives you right to push your opinion down throats of others. Muslims don't eat pork but you can't write about them because they won't allow it, remember fatwa scares anybody even in western world, forget about a theoretical law abiding India.  Hindu bashing is means of your livelihood and one can say, one should greet Satan inside you.  I read in one article you portrayed yourself as superior person because you don't want your own child, well that doesn't make you any superior or responsible than the women who undergoes pain to have her own child.  Pseudo secular and fake environmentalist and fake Brahman, that is what you are since you don't follow essence of Brahmanism in your actions, just using some Sanskrit words in isolation doesn't make your any knowledgeable. I hope NDTV have guts to publish this comment else just remove comment section, why to waste yours and mine time? or just email me telling that since my views are criticizing your writer so I have no right to write them or seek their publication.

                            Very well said! I am glad to see people like you are speaking up, finally! I agree with you. I have personally felt that there is more racism in India than anywhere else in the world. There is no tolerance in the name of religion, no job dignity and no respect for women. That's what our nation has starting to become or it is now so out there because of the media and it had always been like this I am not really sure. Sadly- I am tired of reading and watching these type of horrible incidents. I really hope that this country will find itself to be more progressive, open minded and hopefully humanity will cherish. There is still some hope left is my hope. Please don't care about trolls. Keep speaking up!

                            Dear Swati<br/><br/>
I am a fanatic Hindu. I cant't agree with you more. Every word and between the lines. I feel enraged at the existing Hindu right. I perceive them as a singular threat to Hinduism and as infiltration of psychosis that clearly has roots in the thought processes of religions born out of semitic cacophony.This infiltration is capable of destroying Hinduism that had not just remained insulated but got enriched even during a thousand years of alien faiths. I do not know of any geography during any time in history of mankind where a native religion remained a practicing religion even after just 200 years of foreign occupation. And look at us after a thousand years on 15th August 1947, we were still eighty five percent !<br/>
Swati, I also intend to record a strong sense of hope when I observe that the headline hogging Hindu right is indeed a miniscule minority. The true defining numbers spread across the hundreds and thousands of Indian villages continue to echo your expression.What we are missing is a leadership of substance. The current nadir in body politic is perhaps cyclical. In fact in every aspect of life from politics to literature we are hitting a rock bottom. Therefore, my hope of a rise, of a salvation and in Krishna's promise to Arjuna that He shall return whenever we bottom out, is not misplaced.<br/><br/>
Thanks again for writing this piece  Swati.<br/><br/>

                            Great article and I personally agree with each and every word. Indeed Hinduism is Aham Brahmasmi, with love as central core. But that is for those who have introspected, pondered over matters which are abstract. For the illiterate &amp; poor masses, such though never occur. Their only worry is to step in economic ladder and improve their lot. Such noble thoughts never occur to them as they should often. The role of religious discourses in rural setting used to be a positive influence but the falling standards of  sainthood have affected that. With present TV harping on abnormal &amp; aberrations, make them look like normal thereby letting masses believe that to be new normal. We must come out of this cycle where poverty drives fundamentalism and then to deeper poverty. For God's sake, the politicians should keep their mouths shut or use balanced language. The kettle calling Pot black should not become everyday affair. May all the GODs, Ram, Allah, Jesus, help our brothers to see reason and behave as normal human being.

                            Excellent article. Being a non vegetarian brahmin South Indian myself, I have come across situations described in this article while living in Mumbai. Many of my school and college mates belonged to other communities with whom I still share excellent personal relationships. I worked in Malaysia for a decade and despite being a Muslim country, not even once during our stay I was made to look different. Today unfortunately the voice of moderates like us is lost. An article like this will invite insulting comments from the 'brigade' with name calling and derogatory remarks about the author. Yes, the India which I know and grew up in has changed.

And yes Indian society is loosing empathy, with everything politicized into a high stakes winner takes all discussion. Wonder why we haven't been able to build on the progressive thoughts that existed in ancient India.

Many of these right wingers wouldnt even know whats written in vedas or upanishads and yet they claim to be the defendants of hinduism. However you cannot ignore the fact that there are many sickulars in india as well. These are pure opportunists who try to show they are the most secular, liberal ppl. Unfortunately they dont stand and raise their voice strongly when hindus fave similar issues.

                            Madam, The very first line in your article, claiming you are a Tamil brahmin , points out to a superiority complex and claim that what you do must be correct. Who cares what you are. You are not a role model for Tamil brahmins nor do you represent one. Thank got you did not marry one. Good luck to your husband. You are free to write what you want and propagate what you learnt from the western leftist historians. You can claim to know 100 languages. All these does not make you eligible to give sermons and claim to be role model for others to follow. What I can infer is that you are confused person who is guilty of your actions but want to justify it any cost. So all this stuff - Tambram , Bharathanatyam, Sanskrit shlokas, Yoga etc. etc. It is not going to cut any ice. Anyway Good luck.

But to insist that only this mish-mash must be celebrated, and to hold everyone else who is not having an illustrous diversity like yourself in disdain smacks of elitism and a total disconnect with the relaity of life in vast areas of India, which are rural and small-town. So, kindly avoid judging us from yough ivory towers and high pedestals.

                            These bhakts don't want to evolve hinduism. Just like their sick islamic counterparts, for them ancient text can't be compromised.<br/>
With their philosophy 75% or more of hindu diaspora abroad can't be adjusted into their kind of hinduism.<br/>
They feel threated equally by this hindu diaspora as much they feel threatened by western culture.<br/>
Its becoming interesting with this contrast. Lets see if they find my some accomodating solution!!

                            At the outset let me congratulate this lady, Swati Thiyagarajan.Whatever she has posited in her article are correct and to the point. But the problem in India is not that the people are mad-- they are just fools, an uneducated lot who go by what others say without thinking. And the clever but heartless, dishonest and totally unprincipled politicians are twisting them for their selfish ends-- As Mark Antony after his haranguing speech at Caesar's funeral, quietly murmured " MISCHIEF! THOU ART AFOOT. TAKE THOU WHAT COURSE THOU WILT." A change of guard at the Center has not in any way changed what the average man thinks or does in the country, particularly in the so-called "Cow Belt " of North. The situ in the south of the Vindhyas is more sane and palatable.

The problem with liberalisation is that anyone can throw in a few words and claim to be an expert on whatever they feel will suit their cause. The self proclaiming, pseudo intellect often forget that their hypocrisy leads to a lot of damage. Anyway i may not be a dancer it a reciter of shlokas or married to a foreigner. In fact I am a simple man who recently gave up his job and decided not to have kids so that I can run an orphanage with that money and I now run two thanks to a lot of "psusedo sickular" people you hate. Remember hate is as strong emotion as love. Use it wisely.

Lot of the statements come from the author trying to show herself to be different from most other Hindus. Hindus who; do not eat beef, or meat, believe in a personal god (i.e. not yet evolved to the state of Tatvamasi/aham brahmasmi). Most Hindus who do not eat beef and/or believe in a personal god also do  not accept any of the extremist views on religion. One does not have to eat beef and believe in aham brahmasmi to be a Hindu, you can be a Hindu believing in that and also believing in some other form of God (or even no God)<br/>
The tone and tenor of the author smacks of a superiority complex and goes against the essence of spiritual Hinduism that the author is trying to explain.

                            Real thoughts about Hinduism's universal nature, but that nature also prescribes the caste system with 'Guna and Karma', not by birth. Madam Swathi, you introduced yourself has Hindu Brahmin. Was it by birth or Guna, Karma. Can you please clarify?<br/>
Moreover, vedic hindus ate meat, but not beef. The word 'Goo' in sanskrit has several meanings as you know as you have it as second language. For example, Govinda means 'preacher of benevolence'. The 'Go' doesn't mean cow in that word. Pseudo seculars are using the word 'Goo' in Sanskrit by twisting its meanings as they like.

                            You are right to start with when you say"You are sick" . No surprises on guessing which religion gets bashed up and scrutinized every now and then. People try to explain the perspective of Hinduism from their own point of view including the definition of tolerance level that is acceptable in the modern world. Nobody stops you from marrying a South African who doesnt believe in god or a religion but it never gives you the right to deface the very fundamental Core of Hinduism. We treat Cow as our mother, our God and quite rightly we feel hurt when it is killed for meat. <br/>
Well it is none of your fault. I am in US right now &amp; I can see many 'secular beef eating hindus' around. They justify it in similar lines as you do. Using fancy words like "aham brahmasmi" (I am the core) or having good knowledge of Hindi or Sanskrit to support the theory is absurd and hilarious at the same time. It is also easy to blame the Pollution, Population and not so good state of our country in a public forum but before you do it next time, think once " What have you done for your country?". If you cant then simply shut your mouth and stop blabbering about any religion or country whatsoever.

                            Great article. Keep it up. I wonder the way the extremists responded to her. I read in today's ET that, dalits in one of the villages of Bihar eat Rats (Rat is Ganapaty's vehicle). I fear somebody goes there and kill those ultra poor dalits. India is not so great compared to many countries (where people eat beef there). 1 out of 2 Indians openly defecate, 1 out of 2 Indians cannot read and write, and 2 out of 3 are below poverty line, 200 girl child out of 1000 children getting murdered even before they are born, 7 out of 10 kids who have reached 8th standard cannot solve 2nd standard maths...... None of the countries in the world (Nepal may be an exception) has dirtied their public places as we have done at our place. For us, cow may be "sacred", but for others it is just another animal like dogs, donkeys, buffallos, rats etc.

                            Hi Swati, <br/>
As a Tamil Brahmin, I agree with your toughts on tolerance in Hinduism. The lynching was abominable and should be dealt with severely as per current legal system. The country has far more pressing matters to deal with than a beef ban. <br/><br/>
 Please comment on the following also.<br/><br/>
In a secular country, religion should be separate from law and politics<br/><br/>
1) Why do we have reservation for religious minorities.Its time we got rid of a religion and caste based reservation system and move on to a reservation system for the economicaly backward. ( You may want to do some further research and look at the reservation and other property owning policies in Lakshadweep and Kashmir, 2 nonHindu majority regions of Secular India)<br/><br/>
2) We are a secular country. Why do certain religions need to have a separate civil law. If they want one, then it must be accepted that they will be governed in INdia completely by Indian Penal Code specific to their religion for all civil and criminal proceddings, for example - their hands will be amputated for petty theft, they will be stoned to death for adultery, beheaded for apostasy etc. while the rest will be governed by common Indian law. <br/><br/>
3) Why didnt the President of the country speak out on tolerance when Kashmiri hindus were being massacared and driven out of their lands. Where were the pseudosecularists in the press at that time?<br/><br/>
4) Why dont the press pseudo secularists talk about the carriages in which Hindu pilgrims were burnt alive prior to the Gujarat riots. <br/><br/>
If you do not have adequate answers to these questions or lack the guts to write your viewpoints on them, it is best that you stay on in south africa and write about wild animals and nature instead of unecessary emotionally charged pseudoSICKular articles.<br/><br/>
Thanks

                            While we strongly oppose any killing of innocent people in the name of religious beliefs and politics and people taking advantage deserve the capital punishment, I somehow cannot digest some definitions of Upanishads, Hinduism etc in this blog. Firstly Hindu implies a geographical demarcation of people living between Himalayas and Indian ocean.  Hinduism is no religion and its a way of life for people living in this geography. Brahmin is a person who seeks knowledge of bliss and cannot be called a Brahmin by birth (ex:beef eating brahmin). It has no significance. Aham Bramhasmi is not just a word spoken after reading about it, its a word of experience. If there is an iota of experience of Brahman within, the consciousness then experiences the pain of killing an animal which cannot be tolerated by physical mind. A cow as seen by Yogi, they have the closest consciousness compared to a human. Every aspect of their life is dedicated to humanity by the cosmic design. They turn your consciousness internally and play a big role in your spiritual development. A person who eats beef is actually retrogressively progressing in his spiritual path.

                            by saying she is a hindu Brahmin and eating beef. she insulted her birth as a Brahmin. she is not a Brahmin. she is just another meat person. a Brahmins is some one who is seeking spiritual path and respect even an ant. let alone cows.

                            Well, you are very hot. That explains why you prefer Mahabharatha (Draupadi), over Ramayana (Sita)!

                            This is nice presentation of positive and negative sides of India with moral story that Beef eating was never against Hinduism. Though you may or may not eat it, creating communal polarization based in eating habit is definitely a crime and division of Indian society. We must respect each other in their own choice of faith and food. We should stop communal polarization and try to focus on eliminating our weaknesses and make India  better for future generations. Though I don't agree with your theology but I don't have any issues with your faith and understanding.

                            Great artical!! Few questions for author. Do you eat dog meat? if I develop taste for canabolism, should i be allowed to kill another human and eat? why link Cows with Hindus? Don't other religion people benefit from having it? And one fact -- The reqson you see kind of News headlines that you shared is because that's what media project? have you seen hindu helping and being friends with muslims and vice versa. Media does not dare to report if Hindu is killed by fringe element from other religion. why do you think it started happening? is this recent phenomenon. doesn't your logic says may be it was happening forever but never became news worthy until noe?

                            What was the point of it all? You are a beef eating Hindu Brahmin? Who cares? You have some peculiar idea of what Hindu culture is all about? You are welcome, but again who cares? You are surprised that in India people do not behave according to your preconceived notions of what Hindu philosophy and culture was all about? Why should their behaviour fit into your idea of what it should be? Your husband is a white South African? Good, then he will be able to tell you all about the ghastly racial system known as APARTHEID under which he benefited vastly like all white South Africans. And where black South Africans were treated and killed like vermin? Apartheid was a vastly more horrible and demeaning system than the caste system of India where your Brahmin forefathers practiced untouchability. In India Hindus and Muslims have killed each other for their religion and customs, but never for the colour of their skins. So much for your heritage and that of your husband. Go pontificate somewhere else on your absurd self serving views. You disgust.

                            Is Pork allowed in Gulf? Where are these guys when comes to questioning the freedom to eat. Cow slaughter is prohibited by law in more than 15 states in India, and, these laws were promulgated during congress rule. Where were these freedom to eat fighters in those days?

                            Eating beef will give you a heart attack, also respect animals. How would you like it if someone ate you? Think about it
