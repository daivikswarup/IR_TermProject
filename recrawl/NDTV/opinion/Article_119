Headline::::BJP, Careful, You're In Emergency-Era Zone



DateTime::::2015-12-15T06:19:00+05:30




                                The attacks on the Rajya Sabha and the proposals by more than one leading political personality to undermine the Upper House are worrying.
A few weeks ago, the Finance Minister, ironically also the leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha, wrote a piece that said, "It's a serious question in a parliamentary democracy wherein...the wisdom of a directly elected house is questioned by the indirectly elected house."  Others too have called for so-called "reforms" that will only serve to render the Rajya Sabha toothless.
While superficially persuasive and useful gimmicks to attract attention on Twitter, such ideas are not just dangerous, they go against the grain of our federal democracy. In fact, they are an example of what I called "Cowboy Constitutionalism" in a recent debate in Parliament.
It is alarming that the government and its cheerleaders, nonplussed by the absence of a majority and free run in the Rajya Sabha, have resorted to such assaults, even while commemorating Constitution Day on November 26 and the 125th birth anniversary of the chair of the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly, B.R. Ambedkar, on December 6.
What happened on November 26, 1949, to merit it being regarded as Constitution Day? This was the day when the Constituent Assembly adopted the draft of the Constitution, which came into effect three months later on January 26, 1950. The members of the Constituent Assembly who created the Constitution were indirectly elected by state legislatures, making the Constituent Assembly a precursor to the Rajya Sabha.
And so those who mock the Rajya Sabha and play down its importance are actually questioning the foundational basis of our Constitution. Perhaps this realization dawned belatedly when the Prime Minister praised the Rajya Sabha in his speech during the debate on Constitution Day. Now he needs to act on his words and end this line of argument and attack against the Rajya Sabha.
Those who have asked for the Rajya Sabha to lose its powers to question and force a rethink from the government are being dishonest. With its large and unquestioning majority in the Lok Sabha, the government has rammed through Bill after Bill. The Land Bill and the Goods and Services Tax constitutional amendment are two cases. It is only deliberate interrogation by the Rajya Sabha that has led to the government acknowledging serious shortcomings in both these Bills.
This is fair. The Rajya Sabha is an indirectly elected House, representing the legislators of states and the peoples of those states. Both land acquisition laws and the GST have an impact on the manner in which state governments and economies function. Is the Chamber of the States - which is what the Rajya Sabha is - not qualified to consider such matters? Is this not part of the checks and balances in our Constitution? If the BJP was okay with it from 2004-2014, when it was in opposition and the then government did not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, why does it have a problem now?
That is the crux of the issue. The government makes a lot of noise about "cooperative federalism". The Trinamool Congress has been insistent on putting this into practice as "operative federalism". The attitude towards the Rajya Sabha is a test of this operative federalism.
Precedents cited by the Rajya Sabha's new-found skeptics are not convincing either. There is talk of how the House of Lords was clipped of its wings 100 years ago. But the House of Lords was an unelected body, consisting of hereditary peers and nominees. Neither was or is it representative of provincial and state interests in a federal polity. The United Kingdom lacks the size and diversity of India, with its complex jigsaw of states. And when it comes to local issues with regard to say Scotland, the Scottish Parliament has enormous autonomy that cannot be routinely infringed upon by the House of Commons and the British government in London. This is not the case in India, where for all the nice words about federalism, Delhi's writ still runs large on matters that should be in the domain of the states.
It is said that as we evolve, we sometimes become mirror images of what we oppose. The current government is strangely nostalgic for the era when a single party dominated politics and the Lok Sabha, and could ride roughshod over the Rajya Sabha. The most shaming episode of that phase came in 1976, when the Constitution was amended to give overriding powers to the executive, and the Rajya Sabha, then firmly under the thumb of the government of the day, didn't ask basic questions.
It was the high noon of the Emergency, which senior members of the BJP-led government warn us against day in and day out. And yet, their attitude towards the Rajya Sabha is one that wants to reduce it to an Emergency-era rubber stamp. Close to 175 countries have constitutions, but the average age of a constitution is only 17 years. India's Constitution has weathered many storms and lived for four times that average age. Let us cherish it rather than advocate scuttling its basic tenets, of which the autonomy of the Rajya Sabha is one.(Derek O'Brien is leader, Parliamentary party Trinamool Congress (RS), and Chief National spokesperson of the party)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            There was much hope seeing people Like Derek joining politics. But he has turned out to be a political tool who sit in an ambush all the times to spout cliches, lies and all the fallacies in the book to create obstruction in parliament and to vitiate the political discourse. When he did some thing good for the country by rising above TMC's shallow politics is yet to be seen. Last few times we saw, he was shouting for congress-I.

                            It was very disappointing when you said lawyer's son will be lawyer and doctors son will become Doctor so why not a politician's son politicians in support of Lalu's children. You should have known that professionals go to school, get trained and become engineers, lawyers and doctors unlike 9th grade fail becoming deputy CM! Is that all you need to become politician? If Lalu's son wanted to become a politician then he should have worked at grass root level and find his way up and not by being Lalu's son! Go get some life dude!

                            26 Nov 1949 and 26 Jan 1950, I think the gap is 2 months. Author says 3 months. This is not even a typo. This looks like a minor mistake. But there should not be any such mistake with such important dates of Indian democratic history. Its like telling India got Independence in September.

                            The only reason for this article is that O'Brien is a member of the Rajya Sabha. What is the merit in his arguments? Can the indirectly elected Raj Sabha ever have the status of the directly elected Lok Sabha? The Lok Sabha represents the will of the people. The Lok Sabha directly decides who will form the Central Government and the Prime Minister. The Rajya Sabha came into existence only because we followed the Westminister practice of the House of the People and the House of the Elders. Nothing will happen if the Rajya Sabha is abolished. It is just a nominated group of persons mostly of poor calibre. What are the contributions of Rekha, Sachin etc.? On the other hand, Indian democracy will come to a close if the Lok Sabha is abolished. In fact without realising it he has made an important point. The Constituent Assembly that approved the Constitution itself was not a truly representative body. The Constitution therefore did not and does not represent the true will of the people. The Constitution itself recognised that and provided in Article 368 that Parliament could amend any part of the Constitution. The Supreme Court later invented a basic structure doctrine of the Constitution based on the assumption that fundamental rights could not be touched. In actual fact it used that arguments to entrench itself into power by arrogating to itself the power to appoint, transfer and regulate judges of the higher courts. Therefore the uproar when the NJAC was struck down. Since absolute power corrupts absolutely this has led to the massive deterioration of our judiciary with 3 crore cases pending, nobody accountable and justice not available to the common man, only to the rich and influential. In any true democracy only the House of the People rules. Even in India, it is the Lok Sabha that truly embodies Indian Democracy. The executive, the judiciary and even the Rajya Sabha, are necessarily subordinate to it. O'Brien only reflects his and his party's views which are grossly out of tune with Indian democracy. The TMC is a one person party and O'Brien a mere camp follower with no identity of his own. It is hardly a democratic party in any sense. His views will only reflect that warped reality .

                            If upper house had discussed any bill and given any opinion in the last two sessions then I would have read this article. To come to conclusion upper house and lower house needs reform we just need to see the business done there. Lower house at least have provision to suspend people obstructing the business in the house. <br/>
Parliament is for debate and discussion. If this is not happening then people are not fit to hold that position. Passing the responsibility to the ruling party is shirking the responsibility.

Now RS has become a place to fulfil the personal agenda of the party heads as now a days no party other than BJP can say that there is democracy in their own party. If they don't believe democracy in their own party how can they accept it on public. This is the high time to close RS or bring a bill Anti Stalling Parliamentary proceedings Bill.

                            I AGREE – "such ideas are not just dangerous, they go against the grain of our federal democracy"<br/>
But Tell me: How come a national party holds it to ransom, IS THAT NOT AGAINST THE FEDERAL DEMOCRACY? <br/>
You Said – "And so those who mock the Rajya Sabha and play down its importance are actually questioning the foundational basis of our Constitution"<br/>
Tell me – have the political parties not played down its importance? Are the state governments not selling the seats to business persons for money? We have a case where a businessman from North India, with no business / personal interest in East India is appointed Rajya Sabha member by a state government from Eastern part of India.<br/>
Are such practices not making the mockery of foundation basis of our Constitution?<br/>
I AGREE that these people are not HONEST – "Those who have asked for the Rajya Sabha to lose its powers to question and force a rethink from the government are being dishonest"<br/>
Do you agree that ‘Those who are not letting it work, not letting the matters be debated, not letting bills being voted are being DISHONEST TO THIS COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE'<br/>
You said – "This is fair. The Rajya Sabha is an indirectly elected House, representing the legislators of states and the peoples of those states" <br/>
ARE YOU SERIOUS? Do you want me to list the incidents where RS Members from a state has no direct or indirect relation with the states they represent other than monetary?<br/>
You said: "Is the Chamber of the States - which is what the Rajya Sabha is - not qualified to consider such matters?"<br/>
I agree that RS is qualified, but you tell me: Are they considering? Are they working? OR They are not working? Not letting it work? Not Discussing? Not Debating? Doing Politics? Playing with future of the country? Billing the People of this country by NOT WORKING?<br/>
I am for RS, but it has to work, debate, argue, question. It can't behave in the same manner as LS, where the representatives are elected and if they don't work, they are questioned by the people of INDIA, unlike the RS members – WHO ARE NOT ANSWERABLE TO PEOPLE OF INDIA.<br/>
In my view, these people are supposed to have a CONSCIOUS and should be answerable to that, JUST THAT these days they are ANSWERABLE TO their political masters and not CONSCIOUS………

Gandhi should fight case in court . If the same thing was done by some common man he would have been arrested but than why gandhi's should be spared…. We are supporting Gandhi/Lalu/Mulayam means supporting corruption as cases are register against them and they are accused…...

                            you are right. This time the emergency is created by parties like AAP, CONGRESS, TMC &amp; JD(U) by stalling the parliament and stalling the development work. you people are arm twisting the govt by getting hands-together though all of you aware that you are doing wrong thing. Remember the oath taken while becoming MP or MLA and work towards wellness of the people.

                            Derek O'Brien is symptomatic of what is wrong with our parliament.  One only has to see his aggressive body language and hear his angry, boorish voice to conclude that he isn't using the Rajya Sabha as revising chamber but more as a platform to get cheap publicity.  His shameful loyalty to Mamata on issues where she is in wrong is evidence of his total lack of integrity.  Under such circumstances, anybody with integrity would resign.  He is incapable of using civilised language, calling the Prime Minister 'Butcher of Gujarat' while ignoring the atrocities committed on a daily basis in West Bengal.  O'Brien should be aware that we ordinary Indians are will continue to keep an eye on him.  He is dangerous for India.

                            Agreed, but Rajya Sabha was supposed to be occupied by eminent members of public, not political lackeys! Under Congress the spirit of Rajya Sabha got diluted to the point of irrelevance. That is the situation we are in now.

You are not the people's representative, but the representative of politicians and your seat is there because you have chosen to lick the excreta of Mamta. You talk as if you are the only person who understands democracy. Further you had called Mr. Narendra Modi "the butcher of Gujarat".. Where is your apology?

I may have my differences with him but let us not carry that on this article.. Let us not forget that we had our PM and current Finance Minister also from Rajya Sabha.. Is this not tyranny of unelected Jaitley who should be aptly called MANUFACTURING Minister as he knows nothing of Finance.. Modi needs this shouting brigade and create issues when on back foot to divert attention.. BJP blocked GST and did not let Parliament function and not shedding crocodile tears.. and has awakened to the needs of India.. Let them remember this for post 2019 when they will be in opposition..

He questions Supreme Court's tyranny in deciding how SC judges will be appointed and RBI's tyranny in deciding interest rates and now Rajyasabha's tyranny in questioning the bills that they would like to be passed without questioning. But then what gives him, the unelected, any right to be the Finance Minister?

                            Mr. O'Brien has not one word about how the Rajya Sabha has stalled bills. It is not that the TMC and Congress opposed bills on merit - they went after the BJP, refused to allow a debate. Even today the GST is held up, not because of merit (because a Parliamentary committee has worked out a compromise), but because the Congress is uncomfortable about the judgement against them in the National Herald scam. And TMC is concerned about their own skin in the Sharada scam. Please don't try to fool us, Mr. O'Brien. We can see right through you. One day, even Bengal's voters will.

                            Whether one likes it or not, do away with the Rajya sabha dialogue is not something a sitting minister should be writing about on the internet blogging sites. Its nothing more than gaining a few votes. With India being a population of 1 billion i can guarantee that its not going be heard or read by even 1% of what he wrote. If you really want meaningful argument explain what is the problem or fault in Congress's objection to GST. They have maintained time and again to three objections and i believe its more worth looking into it than taking to internet to explain yourself. Parliament is meant for such things.

You do the Shraddha scam, your friends do the Coal-gate, 3G spectrum, Adarsh, Comonwealth etc scams at the Centre,in the state you have the mining scam in Goa, Virbhadra Singh in Himachal Pradesh.<br/>
I am not even bringing the personal scams of the Gandhi family like Bofors,National Herald and all the scams of their Damad.The government is simply investigating these scams, if they do not investigate you dare them to investigate, if they investigate you call it vendetta. The propaganda of your media agents may give you false comfort that people are being fooled by your strategy to cry vendetta, it will be at your own peril you seek comfort from propaganda of your media agents.

                            I really used to be your fan and used to follow BQC a lot. Recently I realize the you have lost all your thoughts and just follow what is said. Sometimes irrational too.

                            Derek, if elected Govt does not get right to implement their strategy due to Rajshabha then see no value of elected party. I see Rajshabha is a biggest roadblock in the name of Democracy. If elected govt implement bad strategy then ppl will not elect same party in next election.

                            Dear Sir, Is it justified to hold the RS for an event in which none of the MP from RS is grilled or questioned, nor even the party has its presence in RS. is it not the preparation if CBI raids TC MP's for Sarda case and an attempt to supress the govt. as it not have the majority in RS. you are wasting our money please stop this and make the parliament function. we as common man are helpless once we elect you as our representatives. is your duty to distrupt the parliament or to make it function. you decide. we feel sad. that's all.

                            Dear Dereck,<br/><br/>
Sometimes emergency is exactly what is required. Who is actually causing this problem? get to the depth of this first and then comment. Anyways, Indira Gandhi had activated the emergency and she was made popular because of this bold move and the country still respects her for this. The Man who got India on the map Mr. Vajpayee was jailed too. Do you not think that our country needs to be straightened first and then everything else. What's for people/politicians such as your selves who live in ivory towers and talk about the situation in the country when you are reason for parliament disruption.
