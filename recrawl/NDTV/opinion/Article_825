Headline::::In Sena's Meat Support, The Politics of Bal Thackeray



DateTime::::2015-09-11T16:25:00+05:30




                                In the last one week, the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra has stunned the public. One, with its newly-discovered soft corner for rationalists and atheists who were killed for their views on religion and for contesting bigotry; second, with protecting meat shops in the city after a four-day ban on meat was declared by its ally, the BJP, for Jain fasts in the city. The ban on the sale of meat by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) during the Jain fasting period of "Paryushan" saw the Shiv Sena and the MNS setting up meat and chicken stalls in the busy Dadar area of Mumbai.
This is the Shiv Sena whose party supremo Bal Thackeray famously said, "When it rains in Moscow, the Lalbhai open their umbrellas in Mumbai." The lalbhais was a reference to communists, so if you are stunned with the Sena's newfound love for Dabholkar, Pansare and Kalburgi, be assured, the internal politics in the state will deliver more enlightenment. Yes, the same Shiv Sena has lashed out at the Muslim community in Mumbai, attacking meat shops and abattoirs in the past. But now, if the Sena is a fan of Chicken Tandoori, it has got more to do with its increasingly strained relations with the BJP and Devendra Fadnavis, than a love for plurality and democracy.
The Shiv Sena has come on strong against the Jain community even suggesting "Muslims at least have Pakistan, where will you go?" - an ultimatum to the Jains with a veiled attack on the Gujarat community which voted en masse for Narendra Modi's BJP in Mumbai.
In fact, the joke goes that if tomorrow, Modi or any member of the BJP steps in Mumbai and asks Muslims to prove their nationalism or go to Pakistan, the Shiv Sena would throw its weight behind Muslims and even shelter them in Matoshree (the Thackeray residence) if needed. The same Shiv Sena whose leaders were among those responsible for inciting the 1993 Mumbai riots, according to the Sri Krishna Commission report.
So how should one read the meat ban in Mumbai? Is it a part of the continuing attempts at saffronization or the cleansing of the "cultural pollution" as described by a BJP cabinet minister or is it petty politics between a regional player and a national party over one upmanship? As far as Maharashtra is concerned, the politics cannot be overlooked. Last year, just before the BJP assumed power not just at the centre but also in Maharashtra, BEST (public) buses carried posters of the Gujarati newspaper Sandesh.
The advertisement described the contributions of the Gujarati community towards the financial and intellectual development of Mumbai, reading, "Who leads Mumbai's economic and intellectual development? We Gujaratis."
This was enough to provoke both the Shiv Sena and its comic cousin the MNS to start an agitation that which was seen in the 60s against Gujaratis. The advertisements were allegedly put at the behest of BJP leaders from Maharashtra who wanted to consolidate the Gujarati vote (traditionally divided between the BJP and the Shiv Sena or NCP) in its favour. Within days, the Shiv Sena corporator and chairman of BEST Arvind Dudhwadkar instructed that the banners be removed from the buses.
As if this wasn't enough, Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana wrote a scathing editorial on May 2nd 2014 against Gujarati businessmen who supported Modi and did not partake in Maharashtra Day celebrations. The editorial said "All these traders who have been saying they are happy with their businesses and have nothing to do with politics came together to ensure that a person from their state and caste becomes the Prime Minister. But how many of them have ever stepped out of their high-rises to celebrate Maharashtra Day? Living in Mumbai, they have enjoyed the benefits of wealth. They have filled their coffers. They have exploited Mumbai like a prostitute. People who came here carrying a lota (small empty utensil for ablutions) have created cities of gold for themselves. On the strength of this wealth created from Mumbai, these industrialists are manipulating Indian polity. They are scheming who should be made the Prime Minister and who should be brought down."
 
In the late 60s, with Bal Thackeray's tirade against outsiders ("Madrasis" and Gujaratis) at its peak, it was famed that Maharashtrians spoke Marathi in hushed tones once they crossed Charni Road station and entered South Mumbai dominated by the business class Gujaratis.
The meat ban and the hypocrisy around it is a result of a long-standing feud between the Gujaratis and Shiv Sena, which has exacerbated with the BJP gaining an upper hand in the state assembly in last year's state election. The targeting of the Jains is less parochial and more political as it has always been in Maharashtra, where regional parties have chosen convenient enemies.
Where does this leave the cultural fabric of the state and the country? Well, the kebab-eater at Mumbai's famed Bade Miyaan in South Mumbai includes the average Gujarati as well as the average Marathi and the Muslim. This is not about the fight to protect Jains or promote the cultural diversity of Maharashtra. The meat ban, like the beef ban, is another attempt at playing a political yorker by the present political dispensation.
All this when Devendra Fadnavis as Chief Minister promised to bring in a change from the parochial, manipulative politics in the state. But the Nagpur boy, who has in the past refused to take a stand on these diktats, has proven that he and his party will use every trick in the book despite the risk of turning more regressive with every month.
And if Fadnavis continues to cater to this opportunistic, dogmatic politics, he would have taken the first step in the process of  "cleansing the cultural pollution" of what we all so proudly call India's most cosmopolitan city. Perhaps focus instead on the inability to track down the murderers of rationalists Dabholkar and Pansare who are roaming free in the raj of meat ban.(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer.

                            The Ban was imposed by BMC which is controlled by Siva Sena.Moreover this ban has been around since 20 years. Why this hypocrisy.

                            I am a Jain, I just want to convey that please take 'US' out of your (BJP/SS/CONG/NCP/MNS) petty politics. BAN or NO - BAN, those who want to eat 'MEAT', will get it from anywhere. I think our country has more issues like Price Rise, Rupee Downfall, Education, Infiltration, Economy, and for local BMC or State Leaders we have issue of 'Water'(due to less rains)...<br/><br/>
Further to all Jain(s) who are reading, please understand, enforcing such a BAN will give a BAD name to our community which is peaceful and compassionate and NO-NONSENSE people and are doing our BEST to earn and give economic growth to our country. And last, do you (JAINS) realize that on 1st Day i.e. Thursday, some people killed more animals (for meat) just to just defy the BAN?...

                            Phadnavis' silence perplexes me. In a state where poor farmers are committing suicide and even Bollywood actor(s) are coming forward to help, the Chief Minister's silence is saddening. But I also can't help marvel at the selective hypocrisy of our mainstream media, which would spend hours debating the nitty-gritties of the ban, and say next to nothing about the farmers' plight.

                            @Guest4321: it was already extended to 4 days by cong govt in 2004.I accept that these types of ban should go.But, why these double standards, when as a run of the mill, the municipal corporations imposed the ban and everyone is blaming the Maha govt.<br/><br/>
Sena has got personal agenda with BJP because they were made to settle for the number 2 position in the last year elections.<br/><br/>
but, see how these xtitutes are rejoicing. for them a feud in the family of NDA is a day like diwali

The ban was imposed by your favourite sickular party - Congress. What have you got to say on that.<br/>
And for your own shake, do not bring beef into the debate. The day you have the guts to proclaim publicly that you eat PORK, you can think of writing about beef ban. Why don't you understand that Cow is considered as Mother by hundreds of millions of Hindus. What right do you have of slaughtering cow and eating beef. Further the same secular constitution you proclaim is in danger directs an end to Cow slaughter.<br/>
Please respect others to earn their respect in turn.

                            Ms. Rana Ayyub, politics is where there are no permanent friends nor permanent enemies. The present exercise of the Thackerey cousins is simple-- make hay while the Sun shines and scrounge a few votes and brownie points here and there.   As for the BJP, the less said the better. They are proving one thing- that the party is still totally immature to play the part of the' Saviour Of India' vis-a-vis The Congress.  Also for the record the recent vote of majority for the BJP was actually an anti-Congress sentiment and not a pro BJP turn. Poor Narendra Modi!! He wasted his time and energy on a lost cause.Finally to Hell with these RSS and Hindutva fronts who are more harm than good to the country.

                            The word secularism must be elaborated more to describe ourselves as really a secular state. The bans in recent months and days shows our constitution is different from us.

                            This ban has been in force for over 20 years. In 2004, the congress state govt extended it by some days. Not surprisingly, there is no word in this article about that decision of the Congress.<br/><br/>
Sena is not concerned with meat ban or upholding freedom of choice. It's supporting removal of this ban because it was proposed by BJP. NCP protests in Mumbai outside BMC HQ and passes a resolution banning meat in Navi Mumbai for 8 days. Congress passed a resolution in 2004 banning meat too. Bottom line is everybody is playing politics. They all support the meat ban and oppose it depending on whether they are in government or opposition! Only Sena has the unique distinction of passing the resolution in BMC thus supporting the ban and then going out in the streets opposing it! So Sena is both in government and opposition at the same time!<br/><br/>
People are not stupid, We have seen through these politicians. As for BJP, Devendra Fadnavis govt is turning out to be a HUGE disappointment and high time they did a course correction and focusses on the real issues. The way things are going, Maharashtra may well the state that will be easiest for congress to win back the next time.

                            "Cleansing" the city could have waited till BJP delivered in other areas of good governance. Fadnavis has shown good intentions by his "right to service" initiative. But until the results of his intentions are more visible, it is unwise to follow these trivial gains, which the media whips them on and results in loss of support to the BJP. A bitter lesson this one time Govt is going to learn. For us citizens, BJP is better, less corrupt, but their competition doesn't lose public support over silly things.

                            TThis ban was in place for last several years. Shiva sena which control BMC was party to the decision. It is working with a definite agenda of letting down BJP as it is still licking the wounds of humiliation of chief ministership denied to Uddhav Thakre and party being relegated as junior partner in the government and not getting creamy ministries where they can go for usual extortion. Presstitute journalists have created a havoc out of something which was a regular feature in Mumbai every year. Perhaps they do not deserve the freedom which damages social fabric of the society
