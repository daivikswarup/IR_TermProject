Headline::::Nitish Kumar on Modi365: 'Selfie, Not Selfless Leadership'



DateTime::::2015-05-25T23:57:00+05:30




                                If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough, said Albert Einstein. The Modi Sarkar is set to complete its first year in office. And what has this Government accomplished? Even the most articulate ministers and supporters of Modi Sarkar do not have a simple answer. In contrast, any average person can easily tell you what the Government did not deliver. Ask a farmer, an unemployed youth, a housewife, an informed citizen, an artisan, a daily wage earner, an academician or even the people who voted for Modi Sarkar a year ago - they will have no problem articulating what the Government did not deliver.  
Yes, there are no major scams visible on the outside. Coal auctions have happened, though the fallout of that on the prices of power is still to be seen. Arun Shourie, a foremost supporter of Modi's 2014 campaign, says that the Government's widely-publicized receipt claim (of 2 lakh crores) is misleading (he says the actual receipt is merely 6,200 crores). The Planning Commission has been replaced by NITI Aayog (though the work is yet to unfold). The stock market has at least maintained its level and the Rupee has remained range-bound. Post the Jan Dhan Yojna, India may also have the most number of un-operated zero-balance accounts in the world today. Of course, there is greater international recognition for Yoga. The Prime Minister has more pictures than possibly all other Prime Ministers combined, and yes, he has more selfies than all the ministers in his cabinet put together. Apparently, some of this has created a new global recognition for India. Really? Is this the kind of agenda people voted for? It is a typical illustration of more style over substance, more raucous about nothing than the music of change to the ears of the common man.
In the run-up to the 2014 parliamentary elections, the BJP and the Prime Minister ran by far the most vast-reaching campaign India has seen. Such was its reach that slogans such as "achhe din aane waale hain" and "abki baar Modi sarkar" became popular even amongst children. The Prime Minister led the campaign from the front, dared the UPA government to prove it had not failed on key issues and unconditionally promised an agenda of change to the people of India. The brilliant but unverifiable imagery of development stories from Gujarat flooded the social media space. The public narrative evolved so quickly that Secularism became a bad campaign strategy and whatever was left of it was consumed by the slogan of "Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas". Capitalists opened their coffers to the BJP's election campaign and media showed massive public support often aided by clever tricks of camera. The magic worked. Enough people (31%) voted for Modi Sarkar to give a complete majority to the BJP and a significant majority to the NDA.
One year on, there is no magic anymore. There are signs of unprecedented rural distress and the prices of all essential commodities continue to rise without the media creating an alarm. There is a wider belief that the Government is not serving the interests of the farmers and rural poor. Unemployment amongst youth remains very high. Poor and backward states are facing an unprecedented resource crunch. The central government is unilaterally pulling out of or diluting critical schemes of social welfare and poverty alleviation, thereby leaving the States to fend for themselves. Upgrading and maintenance of physical infrastructure of the country remains slow  even though the demand for it is rising. An unnecessary and unprecedented leadership crisis is visible in core institutions of governance, culture, health and education.
Social harmony is so fragile that other countries are taking notice and issuing advisories to the Government of India. People are questioning the undue proximity between key leaders and powerful capitalists while veterans in industry are speaking about lack of access in driving industrial growth. Probably, the Prime Minister has so far visited more countries in the world than states in India, and he has certainly made more visits than the Foreign Minister of the country. Yet, the border situation with respect to Pakistan and China has gotten worse.
Powerful ministers in the Government appear to be out of sync with voters and the key leaders of BJP are too arrogant to admit this. The people of India watched in disbelief when the BJP President Amit Shah dismissed the electoral promises of the Prime Minister as 'Jumlas' meant to entertain people in rallies. This is the mindset with which the electoral agenda of "Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas" transmuted into spiteful campaigns such as 'Love Jihad' and 'Ghar Vapasi' and led to finger-pointing when Churches were harmed in Delhi.
The simplest answer about the Modi Sarkar has come from the Prime Minister himself - he asked the people of Delhi to vote for "Naseebwala" in February this year. However, even this is failing. Of late, petroleum prices have risen. The country has also faced the unprecedented fury of nature in the last one year, leading to the destruction of crops, homes and lives. The response to these is limited to visits by leaders from the centre without anything substantial being done in terms of financial commitment.
The common man from any walk of life in India has simple answers about what the Modi Sarkar did not accomplish. People remember the Prime Minister's promise of bringing back every penny of Black Money, offering 15-20 lakh rupees from it to every poor person in India, and giving 5% - 10% of it as a 'gift' to tax-payers, especially the salaried class. The Home Minister (the then BJP President) set a 100 day timeline for it.The Baba of Modi's Prime Ministerial campaign, yoga guru Ramdev publicly undersigned the commitment through his statements. Farmers of the country know about the Prime Minister's promise to raise the Minimum Support Price to 150% of the input costs. Our youth have repeatedly heard the Prime Minister making the promise for creating sufficient job opportunities. Families of Defence personnel know about the 'One Rank One Pension' promise made by the Prime Minister. None of these have been delivered.
The people of Bihar have seen the greatest disappointment so far. The Prime Minister and other key leaders of BJP have on record promised 'Special Attention, Special Assistance, and Special Category Status' for Bihar. What the Government of India has done for Bihar in the last one year is clearly not special. By accepting the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission while making no consideration for states such as Bihar that will lose critical resources, the Government of India has pushed Bihar towards a financial crisis. Even when the Finance Minister of India announced special assistance to Bihar and West Bengal on the lines of Andhra Pradesh in his Budget speech, he did not incorporate this in the Finance Bill that followed, nor has any concrete step been taken to translate the specific promise into something tangible.
 
The Modi Sarkar that began with tremendous hope a year ago has to now live with immense doubts. People sense that this Government might deliver something, but is unlikely to deliver what it promised. In a recent affidavit filed by the Government of India in the Supreme Court, the Government states that it is economically unviable to offer a minimum support price of 150% of input costs to the framers. Further, farmers across the country are living in undue fear about the Modi Sarkar's intent to snatch away their land without consent through changes proposed in the Land Acquisition Act. People have also seen such U-turns with utter disbelief when it comes to promises on black money, sabka saath sabka vikas, special category status and more. Politically, the BJP has liberated itself from any trust in the coalition-building process through its conduct with the Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal. Further, the BJP President has already invented the formula for transforming electoral promise into votes and electoral pledges into jumla. Taking a cue for the upcoming state elections, the BJP in Bihar is once again out with a battery of promises which would be later reclassified as Jumlas of 2015.
In the last few months, I have gone around Bihar and spoken at a large number of public gatherings. When people hear the audio tape of just a few promises that the Prime Minister in making on issues like Black Money, Minimum Support Price to Farmers, Special Assistance and Special Category Status to Bihar, and Jobs to the Youth, they shrink in disbelief and then titter in disrespect. No Government in India has lost so much trust in merely one year.
People leading this Government love taking selfies. However, now is the time to pause and picture the real India. What the people voted for was selfless leadership and what they have got is selfie leadership. At a time when millions of farmers are slipping into bankruptcy due to crops lost to bad weather, the Government of India is going to spend hundreds of crores for the shallow publicity of one year in Office. In this moment, I feel sorry for the families of the farmers who committed suicide in the distress of untenable farming in India. I wish people of India could rate Modi Sarkar on the poll promises it made instead of being forced to like pictures and stories of accomplishments that were not on the agenda. And yes, we are running the Government in Bihar and I must tell this to some leaders loud and clear - No Scam is not an Accomplishment, it is a duty with legal and moral binding.
This great nation will prosper when Gandhi's Talisman guides the course of our public policy such that the interest of the poorest and most marginalized citizens supersedes that of the haves. Democracy makes you believe that the Gandhian Talisman will prevail. In the eyes of the People of India, the Modi Sarkar is not only failing the Einstein test, it is also failing to live by the Gandhian Talisman.(Nitish Kumar is Chief Minister of Bihar.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Did not expect anything better from you. Keep cribbing about Modi and complain that he has not brought the moon to the earth "even after one year". Why should the government go out of the way and help Bihar? It is your mismanagement and corruption that has made the state go to the dogs. It has many natural resources and has fertile land. No reason why you need special assistance. Dont you feel ashamed to beg and sound demanding even while begging. Can you compare your state to states like Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Karnataka. What do u lack? Why are you Bimaru state? Focus on that instead of cribbing about the PM's performance. The country of the people will give their mandate on the central government's rule when the time comes. Realistic expectation is to see the result of policy changes kicking in around 3rd to 4th year. And if by end of 5 years, there is no tangible change, we know what to do with the govt. Now, get back to work instead of begging.

Also, please don't forget the exam cheating scandal which was taken lightly by leaders like you. Modi was the CM of one the richest states which is a positive contributor to the Indian GDP.  <br/>
So fix your own backyard before throwing mud at more capable leaders.

                            Nitish's jealousy for Modi is well know. He is just another selfish and power hungry politician, who after having tasted defeat at the hands of BJP has gone and sit into Lalu's lap. When Nitish talks about BJP 31% voteshare (NDA 39%), which was 13% more than political party that stiid second, he conviently forgets that Samajavadi party in last assembly election got just 28% and barely 3% more than BSP.Till the time, Nitish was in NDA, they were secular, but the moment he left,they became communal. I have been to Gujrat many times and its a fact, whether nitish likes it or not that, Gujrat had developed under Modi, isnt that evident from Modi re-election thrice. Nitish can claim to relected because, bihar developed under him, but according to him, the same yardstick doesnt apply to modi.Nitish, should have resigned after he left NDA, coz the mandate of 2010 bihar assembly was for NDA and not for him alone.<br/>
I sincerly hope, people of bihar teach a lesson to this backstabber.

                            There is little doubt that this blog is ghost written; Nitish is simply incapable of this kind of blog and this is the second such blog in NDTV.  Therefore credibility is lost by reason of doubt as to the author.  The content of the blog also lacks credibility.  However, there are some facts that are very simple to explain and even Einstein would be proud: 1) Bihar has, for many years been the begging bowl of India; under Nitish's Chief Ministership, which commenced in 2005, no improvement has been made in the status of Bihar or Biharis. 2) Bihar is the biggest exporter of human beings in India: go to any other state in India and you will find Biharis occupying the slums; why? Why hasn't Nitish done anything about that. 3) The standard of education in Bihar is the worst in the country and nobody takes Bihari education seriously.  One only need look at pictures, circulated worldwide, of the cheats climbing the outside walls of exam venues to get an idea of how low Bihar has sunk under Nitish. 4) That Nitish is an unprincipled opportunist is proved by two simple facts: a) Nitish, having invited Modi to take to the national stage POST GODHRA, then went on to stab him in the back using Godhra as an excuse when he, Nitish, thought he may sneak into the role of PM as a 'compromise' candidate and b)having thoroughly denounced Lalu for the latter's corruption then entered into an alliance with the same lalu! 5) Nitish would have us believe that he has been busy visiting all parts of Bihar and assessing the ground realities.  In reality, he wasn't even able to find time to visit the families of the children who died having consumed poisoned food provided by Nitish's government and he did not bother to attend the funeral's of Bihari soldiers martyred by the Pakistanis, one of his ministers saying instead that it was the job of soldiers to die!  There are innumerable other instances of Nitish's deceit and duplicity (such as appointing Jitan Ram Manji as a proxy CM), but one need not go into that.  Suffice to say that nobody should take ghost written (probably by the rascal Pawan Verma) blogs such as this seriously.

                            So how do you want to solve the problems of a farmer? By paying their debt from exchequer? or providing an environment so that they can earn their needs? Agriculture is not something can be controlled by just people. In India major part of the agriculture depends on rain water. My own forms are depended on Nagarjuna Sagar canals and no water in them. My father paid money for bore wells still no water. Finally he sold them to some real-estate company. <br/>
Let me put this question, what you do to get water to my forms? <br/><br/>
Now to generate jobs in India what some one should do? A common person says need to start new companies. How many new companies that you started mr. Nitish Kumar in Behar? None, many of your people are working in other states. Why couldn't you feed your people as you are so visionary?<br/><br/>
Pushing the infrastructure is the only reliable way to provide jobs to masses. It is like agriculture require many people of different skill sets. Now that very infrastructure needs a very important ingredient called land.

                            The salient feature of "DEMOCRACY" is that it "treats all citizens as EQUAL and offers all"equal opportunity"!The same principle holds good in the case of "Free expressions of opinions"!It is said that it was a fashion in late 1770s in USA, when the entire house voted for one proposal, one man would get up, look around, and with a wink declare?,"To keep up the "spirit of democracy", I cast my vote against it"!So the healthy democracy will not grow with "Pouring praises"only! It should be matched with "Voice of difference" too!The word "delivery" has got wide publicity now. That reminds one of a pathetic situation of a new MP in England.A very successful author got elected to the House of Commons(Lok Sabha). He wanted to make his maiden speech. Since he was very shy in nature, he got up and said" Mr. Speaker,I Conceive"-and he could not proceed further so he sat down perspiring profusely!. He made two more efforts but could go no further! Then, a lady member got up and asked,"Mr. Speaker! Who is that Honourable Member,who thrice "conceived" but "delivered" nothing!

                            Nitish's jealousy for Modi is well know. He is just another selfish and power hungry politician, who after having tasted defeat at the hands of BJP has gone and sit into Lalu's lap. When Nitish talks about BJP 31% voteshare (NDA 39%), which was 13% more than political party that stiid second, he conviently forgets that Samajavadi party in last assembly election got just 28% and barely 3% more than BSP.Till the time, Nitish was in NDA, they were secular, but the moment he left,they became communal. I have been to Gujrat many times and its a fact, whether nitish likes it or not that, Gujrat had developed under Modi, isnt that evident from Modi re-election thrice. Nitish can claim to relected because, bihar developed under him, but according to him, the same yardstick doesnt apply to modi.Nitish, should have resigned after he left NDA, coz the mandate of 2010 bihar assembly was for NDA and not for him alone.<br/>
I sincerly hope, people of bihar teach a lesson to this backstabber.

                            Its good to get a selfie than being selfish, you made Majhi as CM, anticipating that it will confirm votes from poor section of the society and he will follow your orders.<br/>
Further,  you joined hands with someone whom you ridiculed and derided so much. Many people would have appreciated if you believe in yourself and trusted your work (and work only) to win election.<br/>
At least, Mr. Modi is very positive in his approach (Swach Bharat, Make in India .. how many of these you heard in last 10 years before ).<br/>
Mr.Modi is delivering and working much harder than any Prime Minister of India.

                            It's typical Pawan Verma style. Dear nitish you may say that modi has not fulfilled his promises but give us some hints that his intention is bad at least we can safely say after so many revelations that UPA 2 deliberately and knowingly made A raja and dayanidhi Maran telecom minister. You deliberately and politically choose manjhi as chief minister. Did you promise your voters that after winning election ppl of Bihar will get chief ministers on roaster system. Did you not fought and got mandate with bjp to rule Bihar against corrupt lalu. So by joining lalu didn't you betray the mandate? True modi is badbola we may differ with his vision but he is relentlessly trying. If cant turnaround Bihar in 10 years how can modi do that in one year?

Modiji, only created the meaning for Selfie and never shied away..One day, sooner or later, Nitish also will realise the selfless contribution of our PM, and may ask for a selfie with our PM!!!

                            Two communities which lost maximum from partition were from Punjab and from Sindh and now, we will probably all agree, these two communities are amongst the most affluent ones in the country.  Obviously, their lands were left behind in Pakistan, so they are not now dependent on farming.  On the other hand, those who are committing suicides are 1. farmers, 2. from Maharashtra, Andhra etc. who did not see any partition.  What is implied that farming the way we practice it in India is no longer able to sustain us.  We have to reduce pressure on farming sector and move the marginal farmers to other professions like production or services.  Our politicians are interested in keeping these farmers glued to farming, so that they can remain poor and remain salable to them at very cheap cost.  Can somebody not marginal farmers to develop other skills and move to other professions, where the earnings are regular and risk of loss is minimum.
