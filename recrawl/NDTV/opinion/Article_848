Headline::::After Pakistan, Modi Isolates Another Neighbour



DateTime::::2015-09-26T21:32:00+05:30




                                Modi's propaganda machine, never far behind Goebbels', swung into action when Modi visited Nepal in August 2014, proclaiming that Modi had visited neighbouring Nepal within weeks of becoming PM whereas Dr. Manmohan Singh had failed in ten years to go to Nepal even once.
 
Saner voices tried to explain that this was because Nepal was engaged in a delicate Constitution-building exercise and an Indian PM wandering the hills and plains of its tiny neighbour would be misunderstood and mischievously portrayed as India seeking to interfere in that country's tangled, seven-year-long Constitution-making process. But saner voices are always drowned out in the cacophony of crowing hype. And the fact that little Nepalese children (the cutest in the world) waved back at Modi as the 56-inch giant strolled barrel-chested down their roads was played up as a huge diplomatic success.
 
The truth took another three months to hit home. On his way to Kathmandu for the SAARC summit in November 2014, Modi sought to make a stop-over at Janakpur in the Madhesi plains to address a huge public gathering there as if he were on Indian, not Nepali, soil. The principal Constitutional gridlock was over the plains people seeking proportional representation in the proposed Nepal parliament and the hill people's demand for equitable not equal representation. Modi, by stopping-over and speaking at Janakpur, was trying to tilt the balance in favour of the Madhesis. A more blatant interference in Nepal's internal affairs could not be imagined. The Nepalese shrewdly saw through the game. And refused Modi permission to hold a public meeting in Janakpur. This was covered up in polite noises about security issues - but was an unambiguous signal from the self-respecting and sovereign Nepalese that while friendly advice might be welcomed, there could be no stepping on sensitive, sovereign corns.
 
Modi passed up Janakpur but remained determined to remain the final arbiter in Nepal's constitutional processes. Why this unwarranted interest in Nepal's internal affairs? Two reasons - one, ideological; two, electoral.
 
The ideological dimension is clear. Nepal, with a Hindu majority, was under the erstwhile monarchy the only self-proclaimed Hindu state in the world - a magnet for the RSS and the BJP whose sole long-term objective is to make India a Hindu raj. Not only has the new Nepal constitution rejected the concept of a sectarian state, it has proclaimed itself "secular" in precisely the same way as India has done. They have thwarted Modi's malevolent plans. The Sangh Parivar have definitively lost their lodestar. Hence, Modi's pique.
 
The second reason is dirty politics. With Madhes running along the entire border with northern Bihar, Modi wants to score political points to push his party over the edge in the crucial coming Bihar election. He believes a pro-Madhesi posture will resonate with the Biharis who have strong ethnic ties with the Terai. Playing such a communal card with a friendly neighbour is just not on. One cannot play with the sovereignty of another country to gain cheap points in a domestic electoral contest.
 
The end result is that the same Modi who was hailed a year ago as Nepal's best friend is now reviled as an interfering megalomaniac. One of Nepal's most articulate commentators, Kanak Mani Dixit (incidentally, one of India's best friends in a country that is not conspicuous for friends of India) has, in an article inThe Hindu, described New Delhi's recent actions as "escalating interventionism, with the gloves off", marked by "an itch to micromanage Nepal", even granting "the external intelligence agency carte blanche to operate overtly." Underlining India's transgression of two principal tenets of the Panchsheel, Dixit indicts India for violating the cardinal principles of "mutual respect for sovereignty and non-interference".
 
Modi has thus done our vital interests in Nepal irreversible damage, confirming everything the worst anti-Indian baiters in that country have maintained for years. We have vital security interests in Nepal. China is Nepal's neighbour on the other side of the Himalayas. In the course of the last few days, Modi has inflicted more harm to India's standing in Nepal vis-a-vis China than all our past mistakes put together. While Modi's India has insulted the sovereign, secular Republic of Nepal by merely "noting", not "welcoming" its new Constitution, while subtly snubbing Nepal's Constituent Assembly by calling it "a" Constitution, not "the" Constitution, and conveying - none too subtly - India's "concern" at continuing violence in the plains, China has upstaged us by declaring that "as a friendly neighbor, Chinese side notes with pleasure that Nepal's Constituent Assembly has endorsed the new Constitution." In one fell blow, the Chinese have ingratiated themselves with the Constitutionally-authorized establishment in Nepal, while India has self-certified itself as a regional bully. The mess Modi has made of our relations with Islamic Pakistan has now been replicated with Hindu (albeit secular) Nepal. Alienating the Nepalese, who are truly the 'pasban' of our northern borders, is the silliest self-goal we could score.
 
Another influential Nepalese public intellectual, Ameet Dhakal, has crucified Foreign Secretary Jaishankar's 12-hour journey to Nepal on the very eve of the formal proclamation of the Constitution, after it had been passed almost unanimously by the Constitutional Assembly. Jaishankar travelled not as Foreign Secretary but as the Prime Minister's special envoy. The purpose of the visit was to reiterate Modi's warning to the Nepalese that they should desist from proclaiming their Constitution until seven major amendments prosed by India were accepted without demur by sovereign Nepal. This was accompanied by the none-too-subtle threat that the agitation in the Terai would be used to blockade Nepal and cut off her supplies of essential civil supplies. No wonder Dhakal was left saying of Jaishankar: "He didn't have a message; he only had a threat." He goes onto condemn the special envoy's "brute way" of "delivery... making no pretense of courtesy and decorum" adding, "his stiff body language and the harsh tone matched the arrogance of British Viceroy, Lord Curzon". This was not, emphatically NOT, Jaishankar's personal doing; he was merely carrying out his boss' instructions. It has led, says Dhakal, to "rage" in Kathmandu.  
 
All this is not only self-defeating, it is so unnecessary. True, there are aspects of the new Constitution that may need further thinking. But the Constitution itself makes ample provision for this by allowing another two years for the Nepalese Parliament to continue functioning simultaneously as a Constituent Assembly. To sort out the problems being raised in the Terai (despite 105 of 116 Terai representatives having voted for the Constitution), these can always be resolved by amending the Constitution (remember, we in India have amended our Constitution more than 120 times!), especially as on the floor of the House, and in writing, the leaders have committed themselves to continuing discussions and negotiations with the representatives of the plains' people, both inside and outside the Constituent Assembly. Why not leave it to the Nepalese to sort out their outstanding problems? Who are we to thrust our views down their throats, especially in the face of Maoist leader, Pushpa Kamal Dahal ('Prachanda')'s clear statement: "Any act from anywhere that amounts to undermining our sovereignty is not acceptable to the Nepalese". It would certainly be unacceptable to any Indian.
 
Instead of partisan (indeed, let's face it, racial) bickering with the Nepalese, Modi needs to recognize that there are not just two or three communities in Nepal with ethnic ties to India, such as the Madhesis, Tharus, Janjatis and Muslims: Nepal is trying to strike a just balance between 125 identified communities stretching from remote, sparsely habited mountain outposts to the teeming plains. It is doing so through a combination of 240 first-past-the-post directly elected seats and 335 proportionately elected seats; special provisions for ethnically cohesive provinces for the plains' people; 33 percent reservations for women; and other such progressive provisions that India ought to be applauding, not sulking over.
 
Alas, good grace is not one of Modi's virtues. The best the rest of us could do is to apologize to the Nepalese for the atrocious behaviour of our establishment and wish them all the best for a stable future. Otherwise, Nepal, like Pakistan and Sri Lanka, will keep meandering for a Constitution with which it can live.

                            This is VERY bad move by India. Imagine if China decided to interfere with the functioning of India's constituent assembly!! Modi seem to confuse the atrong-arm-tactics with diplomacy. It is very frustrating to see India alienating Nepalis just because of Modi's idealogy, stupidity and LACK of finesse.<br/><br/>
India is paying for Modi's lack of brain.

                            The way we handled Nepal is truly a diplomatic disgrace. Even if we want to 'nudge', for lack of better word, Nepal towards a more equal representation etc, it must be done sensitively and honestly. Modi and his sanghi masters lack BOTH.<br/><br/>
The sanghis must realise that their stupid Akhand Bharat is not only an anachronism, it is a blatant sanghi lie to corrupt and control Indian minds.

I agree 10 % are protesting and will be solved soon,but it is getting difficult due to indian support/money/goons. RAW is active , they would like Nepal to be next Sikkim.<br/>
Last 15 years maoist movement didn't pose any danger to india where 10,000+ were killed but all of sudden this small movement is creating huge national security to india.<br/>

                            Good article and a frightening show of incompetence and arrogance by Modi's govt. We are driving the Nepalese into Chinese and Pakistani hands (and they are waiting eagerly for an opportunity to get in). <br/><br/>
The prime minister should kindly leave foreign policy to the foreign ministry and focus on the innumerable things he has to do within the country. Modi's attention seems to be constantly offshore and not on domestic matters. What is wrong with him? And he clearly has no experience in foreign policy and is making a lot of mistakes. He seems to think he can just make foreign policy up as he goes along and is blundering badly. Just because some NRIs offshore gathers and listen to your speeches, please do not mistake that for endorsement of your foreign policy! <br/><br/>
So once again, stay home and get down to work. Enough of this foreign obsession!!

                            Mani is one poor soul who chose the wrong side during partition, and stayed on in India despite his complete orientation towards pakistan. That is the reason while he is at odds with what the rest of India feels. He can still move over to his promised land across the border, but just let him not forget to convert, and there is no farce of secularism in pakistan.

                            Another priceless (and senseless) column by Mr. Aiyar. Condemning Modi's act of engagement in favor of Manmohan's indifference and ineptitude seems far fetched even by Mr. Aiyar's standards. It's ironic that he invokes Goebbelian propaganda when he belongs to a party that maliciously and systemmatically rewrote the history of modern India as a paean to the Gandhi- Nehru dynasty. His criticism which seems more like frothing at the mouth is unbecoming of a senior parliamentarian. Unfortunately, as an unabashed apologist (read bootlicker) for the aforementioned "first family", he does not understand that Mr. Modi cares about pleasing the common man and does not seek the approval of the Stephenian and Doonian "elite" (liberal intelligentsia is too generous a term for these poseurs).

                            Mani is bound to react coz his commie friends are hurt that modi is working ahead of China. Nehruvian secularists would love India following China coz they are the storehouse of knowledge and would not hard India and remain ever committed to pancheel... (1962 was an aberration, aksai chin was another aberration and srilanka was another ......)

                            I read your columns for entertainment value Mr Aiyer- mostly and to get a bit of history for that in between period not coveredin in the history books. <br/>
You couldnt have put it better "But saner voices are always drowned out in the cacophony of crowing hype."- this epitomizes the state of our nation.  The emperors new clothes seem here to stay in our country. <br/>
No room for the centrists. <br/>
And the only centre option cant get over its feudal legacy. Your party owes this country to be a responsible opposition, else we all are  at risk at being drowned in the cacaphony.

                            Thank you Mr Aiyar, for a hard-hitting analysis, a real eye-opener. This is another major failure of the Modi government's foreign policy and had it not been for articles like this one, all we would get is the biased, ignorant and fawning version from newspaper columnists and reporters.

                            I just want to make one point, just after Modi/BJP coming to power, suddenly all other parties especially Congress have become super intelligent. Every move by Modi is being termed as blasphemous and stupid, they seem to have better solutions for everything. Then somebody needs to ask them why were they sleeping all the 60 years they have ruled, why couldn't it rather why didn't they do what they say now. Why they let the country remain as poor and backward, full of hatred against each other which is nothing but a gift of Congress rule all these years. There's a mess everywhere in the country and it cannot cleaned overnight. It will take years of relentless and selfless effort by someone duly supported by us countrymen. Today the whole world is taking note of Modi's leadership but in his own country. And this highly biased Media who are reporting only a few isolated negative things forgetting the enormous positive things happening in the country. God save our country.

                            There is a big confusion being created from Indian side on 40% protesting. I am from Nepal, and let me clarify it: 40% people live in plain (terai) area of Nepal. But, overwhelmingly large members of the constituent assembly members who were elected from Terai region, i.e., out of 40% population being discussed, have voted for the Constitution. Only few have voted against it. In this situation, how can you say that 40% people are opposing it? <br/><br/>
India should not have facilitated a small number of people who have tried to block the import barriers. India did not behave in this way even when Nepal was burning with Maoist insurgency; that situation was not security concern for India; Now, this situation has become huge security concern for India. ... ridiculous.

Its the fact that we Nepalese live on. He has made some good analysis by understanfing the constitution's progressive nature way ahead than Indian one. Most importantly what matters is how majority of Nepalese people think and would like to go ahead. Not a foreign country that demonstrates double standard at the vital point of history making.

God bless Ireland but with caution that neighbouring Nepal hasn't followed their RSS School's philosophy. RSS-BJP doesn't know either Secularism or Sanskrit. They are ill-behaved, ill- mannered, lack depth and don't know the roots of India at all.Secularism stands for human values, respecting all religions and also languages and caste-creeds. Sanskrit and Yoga are there globally well recognized. Let these poision spreding from RSS pracherk's also pass by, India has the potential to recover soon, last Delhi election was an example and now Bihar to follow.

                            Except representing Nepal as tiny neighbour, I agree with almost everything the article enunciate. The article somehow bring out some internal motives but we nepalese also feared of Sikkim incident. We are sovereign country and we don't like anyone interfering in our personal matters. Those who are disagreeing, put yourself in our shoes and think would you take any suggestions(which is actually forcing) by any other country to change your constitution. As per the article, India amended 120 times, let us amend ours. Its been 7 years the CA were trying to pen down constitution and finally its over, let us enjoy it. Yeah, there are few points to amend and it will be done eventually, but some inappropriate demands of Madhesi parties are totally unacceptable. Demands like giving all the rights to the one who obtained citizenship not by birth/ancestral (even US don't have that in their constitution), giving electoral seats according to population(it should be statewise otherwise there won't be enough seats for other states) and adding more districts on terai state(why they want more land it's evenly distributed, I am dubious about some internal motives). The changes that I think should be amended are like equal rights should be given to male and female, all castes and all religion. Jay Nepal!!!

                            The impression that seems to have been left with a vast majority of Nepalese is that  India is very patronizing in her attitude towards Nepal. The endorsement of secularism by the constituent assembly of Nepal must be a message to the rabid elements in India, whose numbers appear to have increased over the last 18 months or so.

                            Modi being R.S.S.'s  agent tries to impose R.S.S. centric agenda on neighbors and gets defeated. India's alienation from neighbors is a result of omission and commission of a person who has no prior knowledge of diplomacy. Generating fear psychosis is Modi's  another tool that Muslims are harmful cannot be applied here as Nepal has very few Muslims..Modi's problem is that he tries his hand in diplomacy single handedly ( R.S.S. agenda) without consultation of officials of foreign office. The result is for everyone  to see. Lastly ,Mahatma Mani Shankar Aiyar thanks for doing Post Mortom, very precisely, aptly  and correctly on a dry subject like Modi.

                            This is one more evidence of Modiphobia to Manishanker,he must know how China and maoisom has taken control of Nepal in 40 years. This is negligence of our foreign policy towards our immediate neighbor and a Hindu state. As a result we faced terrorist's and under world gangs of Mumbai using Kathmandu a safe rout to middle east and Pakistan after committing crimes and also fake currant and sumuglling  but our economy too.The small neighbour's like shreelanka also never respect India and slaughtered Tamil in huge number that was your Congress never kept close neighbor a close friend in our interest. You see Pakistan pushing Muslims of Kashmir on common religion ground to join them and run a proxy war since1948.Was not that your congress run by,for and of one family. Do not forget we are largest democratic country and yet small neighbours bleed us and humiliated us many times so Modified is doing right by taking side of Hindus at least.
