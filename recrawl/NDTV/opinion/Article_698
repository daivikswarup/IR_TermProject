Headline::::Modi Had No Choice But To U-turn on Pak



DateTime::::2015-07-11T15:22:00+05:30




                                Albert Einstein is said to have defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting a different result. This is also an accurate description of India's policy towards Pakistan over the past decade and a half.
The pattern of periodic oscillation between diplomatic engagement and disengagement is wearily familiar. A provocative act by Pakistan leads India to call off diplomatic dialogue, insisting that it can only be resumed if Pakistan meets certain preconditions; there follows a lull when Pakistan is defiantly unyielding; eventually, India is compelled to take the lead and return to the negotiating table despite there being no change in Pakistani behaviour along the lines demanded by us.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi seemed poised to break this pattern by his bold and imaginative move in inviting his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, for his swearing-in ceremony last year. Yet only a few months later, the government called off talks between the two countries' Foreign Secreraries on the grounds that Pakistan had violated an Indian "red line" by conferring with leaders of the Hurriyat Conference ahead of these talks.
Never mind the fact that India had itself facilitated such meetings in the past. This seemed a poorly thought-through decision even at that time. It was never clear why the Modi government had chosen to draw a red line on this matter: hitherto diplomacy had been suspended owing to Pakistan's sponsorship of terrorism against India. In retrospect, it seems that the government wanted to signal that it would engage Pakistan, but only on its own terms.
This diplomatic high-horse was inevitably difficult to ride. Even a cursory analysis of India-Pakistan relations in the past few years would have pointed this out. But the Modi government stuck to the my-way-or-the-highway line. The diminishing returns of painting ourselves into a corner were evident by the beginning of this year. Foreign Secretary Jaishankar's visit to Islamabad as part of his "SAARC yatra" was a clear indication of this.
At the same time, though, New Delhi was talking about a pro-active strategy in dealing with Pakistan's support for terrorism and its violations of the ceasefire along the Line of Control in Jammu & Kashmir. The National Security Advisor (NSA), Ajit Doval, was previously on record claiming that the Indian strategy towards Pakistan should shift from a defensive posture to a defensive-offensive posture. The latter apparently means that India will if necessary take the fight to Pakistan. Just in case this message was not clear, Mr. Doval had added: "You can do one Mumbai and you may lose Balochistan".
The government seemed utterly oblivious of the strategic and diplomatic consequences of making such bombastic claims. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar periodically warned Pakistan of a disproportionate response in the event of ceasefire violations. More recently, he claimed that India was not averse to using terrorists to target terrorists in Pakistan: "kaante se kaanta nikalna" in his colourful language. In the wake of the cross-border military operation against insurgent groups sheltering in Myanmar, a junior minister warned that such tactics could be employed against Pakistan. These statements played into Pakistan's hands by allowing it to claim that India is involved supporting terrorism against Pakistan.
Not surprisingly, the Pakistani response has been even more boastful. Their Defence Minister  claimed this week that Pakistan's nuclear weapons "were not for display alone": they would be used if the country's survival was at stake. The Pakistan army's behaviour has also turned more aggressive, especially along the border and the LoC.
The joint statement issued after yesterday's meeting between Modi and Sharif mentions that the two NSAs will meet to discuss "all issues connected to terrorism". Against the backdrop of the public comments made by Indian officials and ministers, Pakistan will bring up Balochistan and other non-issues merely to counter Indian claims. It is unwise to prejudge diplomatic outcomes, but in this case it may be best not to hope for anything much to come out of this proposed meeting.
 
The wider context in which India has reached out to Pakistan also points in this direction. Indeed, Mr. Modi's U-turn has been executed in unfavourable circumstances.
 
Russia has been vocal in calling for resumption of India-Pakistan dialogue. It has even suggested that the membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization would provide a platform for the two countries to discuss all outstanding issues. This turn in Russian stance on India-Pakistan relations follows Moscow's decision to commence defence sales to Pakistan. More significantly, all this happening in the context of Russia's tightening strategic ties with China. Russia has also been supportive of Pakistan's role in fostering a dialogue between the Afghanistan government and the Taliban. In the past, of course, Russia and India had worked together to prevent a Pakistan-backed Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. Interestingly, Islamabad has also announced that they have recently facilitated one such round of meetings in Pakistan between Afghan officials and the Taliban-a meeting held in the presence of American and Chinese representatives.
 
In short, Mr. Modi's return to the negotiating table comes at a time when Pakistan's hand on Afghanistan is very strong. Islamabad will obviously seek to shrink the Indian presence in Afghanistan as a quid pro quo for a facilitating a deal with the Taliban. The gains made by India in Afghanistan over the past decade are in the danger of slipping away.
 
There will be wider consequences of India being circled out of Afghanistan. During the Prime Minister's visit to Central Asia last week, several commentators claimed that India was at last an active player in the geopolitics of the region-Great Game 2.0. Such fantasies are apparently immune to the realities of geography. Without a working relationship with Pakistan and close ties with Afghanistan, India's ability to project influence and power in Central Asia is extremely limited.
 
Nor is India's involvement in developing the Chabahar Port in Iran likely to compensate for these. In some ways, this project has taken off a bit too late. If Iran manages to clinch a nuclear agreement with the United States, its reliance on-and interest in-countries such as India will certainly be reduced. Already, in anticipation of a deal, the Iranians are driving tough bargains in commercial negotiations with India. New Delhi has to shoulder part of the blame for not making the best of Iran's years in isolation. The Ministry of External Affairs misread the situation by assuming, against all indications to the contrary, that Iran was not sincere about striking a deal with the US on the nuclear issue. If such a deal does come through in the days ahead, then India's room for manoeuvre in its Western neighbourhood will be further restricted.
 
Nevertheless, even if the context and timing are unpropitious, Mr. Modi's decision to reach out to Pakistan must be welcomed. By agreeing to travel to Pakistan for the next SAARC summit, he has raised expectations of progress. Inevitably, there will be attempts by various groups in Pakistan to play the spoiler and pressures from his own base to act tough. Let's hope that Mr. Modi can stay the diplomatic course.(Srinath Raghavan is Senior Fellow at Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

With all of above, do we have an option to immediately engage in war, with Pakistan?<br/>
How many of those who wants a war (in the name of teaching Pakistan a lesson) are ready to see their parents, beloveds (&amp; themselves) getting evaporated in case the first nuclear comes from Pak?

                            Your article doesn't catch the subtlety. India refused to talk for a reason, to be talking at its terms. See the joint statement, Kashmir has been conspicuously omitted &amp; others only discussed. The terms have been laid out, get it. It is not the Einsteinian repeats as some might erroneously conclude.

                            The loose canons of BJP should stop barking from time to time. Government should play a serious diplomatic role to tame Pakistani counterpart. Terrorism is a common problem for both the countries and must be handled jointly without a blame game. If Pakistan doesn't behave we need international pressure but diplomacy is the only way. Nawaz Sharif is pro India and it is a good opportunity for Modi government to keep him ally and share the concern of India's interest.

                            Earlier approach by NaMo Govt was very much unprofessional and childish like. Ministers were making irresponsible statements which have resulted as big jolt in Indo-Pak relations. Two PMs not looking at each other at SAARC meet in Nepal can not be imagined. It will take lot more efforts to come to meaningful dialogue. Matured action without blowing the trumpet in media is need of the hour.

                            There is really no need to talk peace with Pak. All of India's previous efforts have failed and if at all Modi makes another effort to talk peace with Pak, it is bound to fail too. Sad thing is that India never learns from its mistakes and Pakis know this well.<br/><br/>
What is needed for India is ignore Pak and be vigilant like Israel does with its neighbours. There is really no need to keep India's embassy open in Pak. It is just an unnecessary overhead and burden to the govt. India needs to move on with its development and take care of its own security.<br/><br/>
I agree with Srinath's first paragraph on what Einstein said. It is India's insanity to keep making efforts to have peace with Pak!

                            There is a advertisement of the British TV where a child is throwing tantrums on the shop floor of a supermarket and the mother is overlooking trying to control the suitation.    In the next scene the mother is on the shop floor throwing tantrums and the child is standing straight in a confussed manor wondering what to do to control the situation.   Perhaps India should also act unpredictable and put Pakistan in situations were it has to finger out what to do next.

If he acts strong against Pakistan the Indian opposition congress parties and media will oppose him where as he is doing the right thing in larger interest of India to protect India from china pak pact to derail India.

                            Going by what you wrote in the first two paragraphs the similar patter of relationship seems to be there still. First during first NDA rule the wagah bus service was started with a lot of fanfare and then the parliament attack occured and what followed is known to everyone. So with an unpredictable pakistan we can only keep our fingers crossed. What the media reports are then pakistan is posturing a lot more sensibly after a taste of their own terrorism, so we can hope for better now.

Knowing Pakistan establishment specially army and ISI , no one should hope or to be fooled by meetings like this. Pakistan itself is suffering from terrorism which they have only fostered on their own soil, now they are paying price for it. Still for many establishment for Pakistan , hurting India at any cost is the motive , even if that means suffering of their own people and country... same as have suicidal tendencies of extremist.

                            The best way to deal with China is for India to shadow every product and service China provides and do it better and cheaper.    It is disgraceful that India has not organised itself to compete with China.   Indian government. Must help private sector to produce up-to-date high tech stuff.   Despite The fact that Chinease can not speak English that well they are the world leader in producing goods in international market.   This is the root cause why India is on the back foot.   We should make use of our strengths and organise ourselves better to counter external threats.

                            It's nothing but bringing Russia China in to picture. Us and Europe couldn't do any thing to stop Pakistan. Nationalist modi can't afford to loose more soldiers and citizens life. Ask those who lost their loved ones in terrorism and cross border firing. Peace is the only option and should be achieved by any means. Pakistan is not bothered about US warnings but surely scared of Russia and China because of geographical location. Modi is playing a very tactical game and we wish he wins.
