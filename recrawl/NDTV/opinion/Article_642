Headline::::Decoding OROP and the Politics at Play



DateTime::::2015-06-02T20:16:00+05:30




                                In his latest Mann ki Baat radio broadcast, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated his government's commitment to implementing the one rank one pension (OROP) scheme for the armed forces. Noting that this was a "complex issue, vexed issue", he asked ex-servicemen and soldiers to give him more time to address the matter.
OROP is apparently one more issue where the expectations raised by Mr Modi cannot easily be met. The Prime Minister's statement came against the backdrop of growing disquiet among ex-servicemen. They rightly observe that just a couple of months back, during his visit to the Siachen Glacier, Mr Modi had claimed that OROP "has been fulfilled". At the same time, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar has insisted that OROP is "on its way", though he has refused to give a specific timeline for implementation.
All this has led the retired soldiers to wonder if the government is attempting to row back from or dilute its pledge. Their response, however, has been excessively sharp. Last week, two war veterans refused to be felicitated by the Defence Minister in protest against the delay in implementing OROP. Senior representatives of the Indian Ex-Servicemen Movement (IESM), which is leading the campaign for OROP, have described the delay as "breach of trust" and "betrayal". Widespread protest and relay hunger strikes are planned to be launched in various parts of the country on 14 June. It is not surprising that Mr Modi felt impelled to bring up this issue.
Yet the Prime Minister's own comments may have muddied the waters on this issue. In a recent interview to the Tribune, he noted that there were "varied versions about what the definition of OROP should be" and that sorting these out was taking time.
In fact, there should be no doubt about what OROP means. It is the working out of the nitty-gritty details that is tedious and time consuming. The principle of OROP is straightforward: soldiers retiring at the same rank and after the same length of service should receive the same pension. This implies that the gap in the pension received by current pensioners and older pensioners must be bridged. It also means that any future increases in the rate of pension should automatically be passed on to past pensioners.
The demand for OROP stems from several reasons. For one, the principle of OROP was actually in existence until the Third Pay Commission of 1973. Thereafter, the government decided to apply pension rules for civilian employees to the armed forces as well. The removal of OROP led to continuous petitions from retired soldiers to successive governments. A series of committees examined the issue from the early 1980s onwards, but it led to little more than a tinkering of rates of pension for ex-servicemen and their families.
 
A second, and related, reason is that military personnel typically do not serve for as long as their civilian counterparts. Owing to the steep pyramidal structure of promotions in the armed forces, the bulk of the soldiers retire between the ages of 38-40 while most officers have to retire at 55. Unlike civilian employees - who are eligible to serve until 60 - those joining the armed forces have effectively to forego several years' income.
 
Further, there is a subtle sociological dimension to the demand for OROP. The individual and collective identities of soldiers, whether serving or retired, are shaped around rank and organizational standing. The fact that a senior retired officer may draw much less pension than an officer who retired later but at a junior rank is an important driver of discontent.
Finally, the decision to equate civilian and military personnel does scant justice to the special conditions of military life. This is not just about the greater hardships and danger in the latter, but also the fact that soldiers operate under an institutional laws and norms that are much more restrictive than those governing the career of civilians.
 
The growing unrest among ex-servicemen is not merely because this issue has been hanging fire for so long. It also reflects the deep institutional divide between the military and the bureaucracy. From the early years after Independence, there is a feeling in the military that civilian control has translated into civil service control. The bureaucracy's institutional position between the military and the political leadership has been problematic all along. And its stance on OROP has been perceived as inimical to the armed forces' interests.
 
This perception is not entirely without foundation. In the past, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has opposed the restoration of OROP on several grounds. While their concerns about the financial implications were understandable, they also cited several specious administrative and legal hurdles.
For instance, while testifying before a parliamentary committee in 2011, a senior MoD official claimed that implementing OROP would be difficult as records of defence pensioners were discarded after 25 years. This was patently absurd and false. In fact, it is the record of non-pensioners that are destroyed after 25 years.
Similarly, the official claimed that extending current pay and service benefits to past pensioners would amount to discrimination under the constitution. In fact, the Supreme Court had already ruled in 2009 that OROP should be granted to the armed forces. Equally untenable is the argument that OROP for the military would necessitate similar concessions to the paramilitary and civilian services. In both those cases, personnel tend to serve until the age of 60 - very unlike the armed forces. Of course, the position of the MoD has changed in the last year and a half. Yet doubts about the bureaucracy's obstructionism loom large in the minds of the ex-servicemen.
 
The issue of OROP not only threatens to widen the gap between the military and the bureaucracy, but has other potential implications as well. Opposition parties have jumped into the fray, sensing an opportunity to embarrass the government. The Defence Minister has rightly requested that this issue should not be politicized. Yet his own party shares the blame for the ongoing politicization. After all, it was Mr. Modi who picked this issue to attack the UPA government with during the last general election and claimed that only his party understood the interests of the armed forces.
 
More worrying is the increasingly political stance of the ex-servicemen themselves. Major General (retired) Satbir Singh of the Indian Ex Servicemen Movement (IESM) has claimed, "We the ex-servicemen supported him [Narendra Modi] and played an important role in bringing the BJP in power." Soldiers like citizens are free to exercise their choice in the ballot box. But it is disastrous for associations of ex-servicemen to rely on the patronage of any political party. In making the case of OROP, retired soldiers have emphasized the bond between retired and serving soldiers, and the consequent need to have sound policies for ex-servicemen.
However, these links and circuits of influence stretch to other issues too. Can serving soldiers be insulated from the partisan politics to which groups like IESM are now resorting? This could easily pave the way for the politicization of the armed forces.
 
The dignity of the military rests in dealing with the government of the day as an institution of the state and not as a political party in power. It is therefore incumbent upon ex-servicemen not only to steer clear of partisan politics, but also to take the Prime Minister at his word and give him time to work out the details.
At the same time, the government should also realize that there must be some grace in the giving.(Srinath Raghavan is Senior Fellow at Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            PM appears committed on the issue of OROP and if he is asking for some time to fix some loopholes what is there to doubt? Retired army personnel would definitely understand the appeal and assurance of their PM.

                            All these objections are raised by babus who do not want soldiers to get their due. Modi should order release of revised pensions first and ask babus to work out the formalities later. And send all babus retired or serving to the Ladakh border for 6 months. Automatically all dues will be released.

                            OROP will never get implemented under OMOS Government. Want to know what OMOS is? Here it is "ONE MAN ONLY SHOW". Still cannot understand this? One man is Namo and only his show will get implemented.

                            It is incorrectly played that :-<br/>
a)	BJP or Congress have/awarding OROP, where as it SC rule 2009 has led to this so far<br/>
b)	Parliamentary Hoshyari committee has  deliberated and approved the same<br/>
c)	If political will exists it can be done in a whiff. This canard of complication is another lie being perpetuated by political masters and aided by bureaucrats.<br/>
d)	In 1975 from 3rd pay commission the equation was changed where babus were given 50% pension against earlier 30%, where as it was reduced to 50% from 70% for defence in 01 stroke. No such complicated calculations were arrived then.<br/>
e)	NFU to Babus ear away so much of tax payers money is not highlighted and no complicated calculations are envisaged.<br/>
I don't think there should be any debate on  award/ promulgation of OROP, as this is already cleared by SC and by Hosiyari Committee in parliament. It is not a charity / bhik-sha that country is giving. This effort to confuse the award of OROP with civil counterpart has be adequately explained yet this relentless effort to confuse.<br/>
If it is not done or delayed further (already 33 yrs are gone and a generation expired) , it only means that nothing happens in this country by peaceful means.

                            The author writes " Equally untenable is the argument that OROP for the military would necessitate similar concessions to the paramilitary and civilian services.

The members of FORCES LIKE BSF,ITBP,Assam rifles, CRPF  can work till the age of 60 is a myth. An ordinary soldier of BSF or ITBP has to retire after 17 years, the pension is much less than a peon. They have no collective voice unlike military. <br/><br/><br/>
They have the most difficult service conditions in India, please have a look at the BSF soldier standing at the International border, the army is much behind him, still the military says these are police personnel, not worth for warfare. This attitude has to change . All such departments are serving the country and are equally important. <br/><br/>
No one is against OROP, but we should  also consider how other countries are granting pension to their  military pensioners. <br/><br/>
With all these schemes in place, the government is left with hardly any money for development.

                            Sadly the bureaucrats and the Central Police Force chiefs are muddying the waters of OROP. Other than Assam Rifles the country has no other para military forces. The rest are police forces who retire at the age of 60. Besides they have been granted Non Functional Upgrades which our Defence Forces have not been given. OROP has been made a joke by these jokers and the real deserving soldiers are being made to look like fools!

Please do not pounce upon me for my query. I am just trying to understand if this defined benefit scheme is affordable for India, over the next 20-30 years and if, this is the reason why Govt after Govt is dragging feet over it?

                            The other services claim has killed the OROP even before its delivery.They should have waited for the implementation of OROP for armed forces then projected their reasons to justify their claim if their employees are thrown out at an age 35-38 years.

                            Sir, The specious arguments that are being now brought up by the Finance Ministry shows the deep fear that the babus have for the Military, notwithstanding the incredible support and protection that the military has provided to the country both in times of peace and war. It is because of the fact that the military has kept itself away from the political scenario, that the present situation has arisen. It is high time the ESM join and improve the political scenario in this country of ours. The Armed Forces are the one true Secular Institution that exists in this country, and the gems that come out of this institution have so much to offer, other than their life and limb as soldiers. The nation should NOT deny them this, rather should welcome their entry into the present morass of corruption and cutthroat one-up-man-ship that is the political scene today.

                            If PM can't even give a date/ time period, what can he expect ESM to do? At least start implementing it for people above 7-80 years of age right away. Some of them may not have enough time for Modi team to sort out the googlies Babus are throwing at them.

                            More time needed for OPOP. More time needed for giving 15 lakhs to each citizen, after getting black money. More time needed for bringing back "acche din". More time needed for addressing farmer and agrarian crisis. But enough time to visit 21 countries within first year. No money for OROP, but a billion dollars for Mongolia. This govt is directionless, and running around like a beheaded chicken.

                            To make it simple - I retired as Wg Cdr in 1983. Let them give me the pension of Wg Cdr retiring now. It's simple and easy. Arrears can come a bit later.

                            Iif country have to go for dogs then introduce OROP.<br/>
I will explain why?<br/>
1)All civilian employees do "Contributory Pension" and even for the similar duty/fight/trauma/alienaton from family(more than Army) performed by BSF/CRPF/ITBP/SSB/POLICE etc but Army/Navy/Airforce don't<br/>
2)No independent war is worn by Armed forces without able support from the above forces (CPOS)and if we fall prey to the extortionist demand of Army then it will demoralize the entire para military forces as well as police who have a larger role in nuclear armed country like India where history speaks that no TWO nuclear armed countries ever go for war<br/>
3)Armed forces personal get "Ex service man "status while no police or paramilitary/CPOs personal were extended such facility and then its Army Jawan who retires early and search for new horizon while due to artificially created deficiency in Forces make them eligible to serve still latter stages<br/>
4)Once OROP is implemented then there will be more deficiency of officers as they will no charm or incentive in remaining at job or serve the country and therefore after putting up minimum years of service of pensioner qualifying service<br/>
5)How government is going to calculate the resettlement and benefits earned by ex service man after putting their minimum service in Army and get absorbed in PSUs /Banks/railways etc and corporate(end of the day the defense for OROP implementations is that Armed forces retire early therefore need equity with civilians (Civilians contribute for their pension if any while Armed forces including ARMY,NAVY &amp;AIRFORCE DON'T)<br/>
6)Who will foot the bill-Hapless Tax payers<br/>
7)Isn't right time to get away of the flawed SSB which is skewed to keep supply crisis at optimum and create pressure on bureaucracy as well as government by Armed forces (Even after shelling crores on Army schools &amp; Military school then what is the use of them when they are not able to nurture future soldiers who can qualify doubtful SSB <br/>
 8) Does OROP will affect fight against militancy/naxals etc-Ans,Yes ,Definitely as BSF/CRPF/POLICE/ITBP are fighting major internal war against miscreants along with guarding the border and they stand demoralised<br/>
9)Does OROP is extended to other forces(CPOS) whose jawans /officer suffer die in harness or get boarded out in disable condition fighting militancy and Naxals,Ans-No, In democratic India we can't allow two sets of Armed forces doing same sets of job but treated differently(Here we have to take leaf from the experience of our neighboring country Bangladesh were BDR had gone on mutiny and DG and many of the family members lost their life.Here if OROP if needed to be implemented then it should be only for Jawan's, medically boarded out personals due to suffering from ON DUTY, for families whose husband/wife died in harness fighting or ON-DUTY for the motherland.No OROP for those who opted for going out of the service VOLUNTEERLY for finding new pasture in corporate world or PSUs. IF WE FALL PREY TO ILL ADVICE OROP THEN ITS REPERCUSSION CAN BE FELT IN POLITY,ECONOMICS,FISCAL and all parts of life whih a new government can ill afford . OROP will give no positives for nation building but permanent pain in overall health of India(congress/UPA had shown maturity but if BJP is falling prey to the design of few and country is definitely going to be doomed if implemented(Rs 10,000 crores will be the immediate requirement and once 7th pay commission is implemented then it will create havoc in the fiscal) . If honorable PM Sh Narendra Modi implements it then he is signing the death warrant of republic India. we don't want a militarized India.

                            Whether it is BJP or Cong govt, they depend on BABUs who are against and never pay due respect to defence officers. It is pity at times that Army chief wait for hours together to get audience with Defence Minister due to some BABUs playing game in between. OROP is difficult to materialize.  Even if it is materialized, it will be a diluted version where Ex-Servicemen would get pittance. Jai Hind!

                            After reading comments from fellow commentaries, the issue is not as easy as it seems to be. The army men who retire at upto 40 should resettled and retrained into good jobs or businesses (not petrol pumps). Those army personnel who have been physically disabled should be getting all perks, pensions etc that any other civil servant gets. This will take care of over 80% of the people. The rest who retire late should get what their civilian counterparts get.

                            i do not think realistically any government can give OROP. The defense pensions are already 54,000 crore/year and this will add another 9000 crore to it annually. Don't think it is practical. If Modi promised them this - it was most probably a false promise.
