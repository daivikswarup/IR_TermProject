Headline::::What Modi Managed in 48 Hours in UAE



DateTime::::2015-08-18T14:16:00+05:30




                                On August 15, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi was speaking to the teeming millions about our country's glorious progress after independence, a few hundred miles away, across the LoC, ceasefire violations by Pakistan killed six people. The security of the people is of utmost importance in the light of these incidents. This has been a major thrust of focus by the Prime Minister during his two-day visit to the United Arab Emirates or UAE.
For the first time, UAE and India are on the same wavelength with respect to terrorism. The PM in his speech has categorically mentioned that both countries will not tolerate the terror wreaked in the name of religion. Those who were responsible for horrendous terror attacks in the country like the 1993 Mumbai blasts and the 26/11 attacks and are still being harboured by Pakistan ought to be punished. In order to combat terrorism, a joint statement has been made by India and UAE wherein both countries condemn efforts, including by states, to use religion to justify, support and sponsor terrorism against other countries. They have called for international co-operation and intelligence sharing in counter-terrorism operations. They have also proposed to work together for the adoption of India's proposed Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism in the United Nations.
The warm welcome received by the Hon'ble Prime Minister is a far cry from the hostile environment created by the Pakistani leadership. The Prime Minister was welcomed at the VIP airport in Abu Dhabi by the Crown Prince, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan along with his five brothers. The Crown Prince reportedly by-passed the official protocol wherein a visiting dignitary to the country is only welcomed by the Foreign Ministry head Sheikh Abdullah, who is the Crown Prince's brother. This gesture underlines the respect and appreciation of Modi by the UAE leaders. 
This visit is being regarded as one of the most unforgettable chapters in Indian history as it is the first visit by an Indian PM to that country in 34 years. The UAE has also extended support to India's candidature for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council as the two countries called for reforms in the current UN constitution. In addition to this, the Prime Minister was also treated to a multi-course vegetarian fare (including a Royal Gujarati Thali) which was made by India's leading chef, Sanjeev Kapoor, who was specially flown in by UAE hosts. Though Indian heads of state have not paid any visit to this country in a long time, this visit by the PM has been much appreciated by the UAE leaders and people alike. Mr. Modi spoke to almost 50,000 Indian expatriates at a grand public reception named "Marhaba (welcome) NaMo, which is being hailed as unprecedented in the history of the UAE, where for the first time a visiting head of state has been given a reception on such a grand scale. 
Another small but significant takeaway from this trip is the promise by the UAE on Sunday to allot land for the first-ever temple in Abu Dhabi. The PM has thanked the UAE leadership for this landmark decision.
Apart from these, the two-day visit also promises to bring favourable economic implications for India. The Indian expatriate community is the largest ethnic community in the UAE which remits millions of dollars to India annually. Though this is a known fact, a lesser-known fact is the humongous economic potential of the UAE with respect to Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs). UAE companies have been investing in Africa, eager to tap their resources in the world's fastest growing continent. Similarly, the UAE has also been looking east to strengthening its trade ties with China. In light of these investments, India projects itself as an attractive investment destination so that it does not lose out on the immense economic benefits which come with being associated with a country like the UAE. The PM announced in his speech that UAE plans to invest 4.5 lakh crore rupees in India, which would give a very big boost to our economy.
With respect to the India diaspora in UAE, PM Modi addressed the labour issues faced by the Indians alongside improving trade and bilateral relations and seeking investment. It is important to mention here that the profile of the expatriate Indian population in the UAE is very different from that of the US - where Modi addressed tens of thousands of screaming, cheering Indian Americans at Madison Square Garden. The typical Indian expatriate in the UAE is a blue-collar worker. Some 50 per cent are in unskilled or semi-skilled jobs, and 30 per cent are in medium-skilled professions.
The PM has left no stone unturned to reassure these labourers of the government's support and ensure their welfare. On Saturday, Mr. Modi visited the ICAD Residential labour camp in Abu Dhabi which houses nearly a lakh people from various Indian states (mostly migrant labourers) and from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal which shows his commitment to address the concerns of the large number of Indian expatriates in UAE.
These instances, and the excited reactions of the Indian expatriates in Dubai as well as UAE leaders, show that the promises made by our Prime Minister are not false. "Maine koi bhaashan nahi diya, karke dikhaya" (I have walked the talk), said Mr.Modi in this year's Independence Day speech. With his UAE visit and the developments thereto, the faraway sands of UAE are not a mirage, as the Opposition claims but  a tangible reality, thanks to our Prime Minister.

Me and my wife was one among them – and thousands stood outside the stadium and we reached the venue 6 hours before the event but still have to park the car far away from venue and walk a long distance, but all hardship to reach the venue was worth and as it was an once in life time experience to hear our PM's electrifying speech, for me and my wife this is the first of kind attending a meeting with such huge gathering…Thanks to our PM to visit us…

                            All modi did was to acknowledge that congress did a good job in 60 years in making india a world power. This is a u turn from his preciously stated position. Unless he thinks that indias banking, telecom, food sufficiency, space program, agni missile, insurance, retail, softwarr industry etc, all were started by him in the last 1 year...

                            Being a hardcore pracharak, he knows how to make headlines by just make some announcements, organize shows overseas, utter some street language phrases on which the paid cheerleaders start whistling and chanting NaMo. What is lacking is public decency and statesmanship not to criticise his own country and countrymen on a foreign soil. Instead of blaming, why not pick hundreds and thousands of achievements done in last 65 years and build India's image? When it comes to achievements he twists facts and makes people believe as if everything is done by him. Waiting for the day to see some sincerity and statesmanship in him.

                            Great update and to add I actually had the opportunity to listen to Mr. Modi's speech in UAE. There was only one thing - Development of our country. Fools are those who compare Rahul Gandhi to this personality. I think the UAE visit is an eye-opener to all those Muslims in India who do not favour our PM.<br/>
Unfortunately other Muslim countries have given him this extra-ordinary privilege and respect but within India he has always faced criticism.<br/>
Its time we come out of our foolish apprehensions and work for the development of our nation.

                            What an irony? That an international state kept its generosity to give a plot of land to a another country's PM to build a temple n who accepted it with all humility. However, the same PM's party in his own country proclaim mercilessly for having demolished a historical monument for praying of a minority community n spreading filthy hatred towards minority to create a hanky-panky vote banks to grab power at center. The PM should have responded by announcing with the same generosity to proclaim the reconstruction of the same fallen historical monuments to make the minority community content and becoming the only statesman in entire world to have done for the great Indian ethos of togetherness for which India stands for?

                            Not one word about the conditions in which Indian labour love,  was discussed.  Instead of Modi going there,  he must have sent Sushma,  Manohar or Maneja. They could have done a better job.  Modi can make good content for gossip channels where they can discuss what clothes he wore,  how did he wave his hand and hug the other heads of state.  In terms of India's position, it has no improvement.

                            BJP and specially Mr. Modi can not rise above such superficial rituals and hypes. In the process the strategic objective and serious talking takes a back seat. Such behavior will satisfy the people but will have little impact in the international relation. Mr. Modi has visited so many countries, but there has been no change in India's stature in a global platform. Rather Pakistan has maneuvered strategically which has resulted in a big U turn in Mr. Modi's approach towards Pakistan. All 56" behavior is nowhere to be seen.

                            Looks like internet trolls are at it again. While constructive criticism is welcome, people must refrain from criticizing based on their entrenched opinion. The ground realities are shifting slowly but steadily for the good in India. 48% increase in Foreign Direct Investment, Strengthening of ties with all strategic neighbors, bureaucratic corruption in Delhi at an all time low, repealing obsolete laws, long stalled decisions vital to nations interests being taken swiftly and most importantly, the policy paralysis in the previous regime seems to have vanished. Seems like the only people who are having a problem are the ones that were thrown out of power and their sycophants. Please give this man a chance and let him finish his term. We atleast have a PM who has an individuality and is willing to work for the betterment of the country.

Jain temple or accommodation for labourers ? Why only Gujarati temple ? This is insult for other Indian citizens living in UAE and clear discrimination with other section of people ? Do PM hold rights to talk about 1.25b people ? PM must understand that he is the PM of Secular India, does not represent only one community.

                            Despite all the propaganda behind every move of Modi abroad  the fact remains that Indians are yet to get a whiff of the promised aache din . It's the same old corruption pollution and population

                            No one really cared for the NRIs in UAE until now. Congis didn't bother. Modi spoke about Indian opportunity and UAE responded. They invested 2 billion for the MMS but 70 billion now. That shows that the faith towards this nation led by a non corrupt person has increased Multi fold. Congi chamchas who can't bear this can just look and learn how a country had to be ruled without corruption. Enough of your fake Gandhi names!

                            Modi should have visited Qatar first. Qatar is the most influential country in the ME next to Saudi Arabia...
