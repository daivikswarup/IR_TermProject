Headline::::Mani-Talk: The Controversy About My Remarks On Charlie Hebdo Attack



DateTime::::2015-01-12T17:18:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)I was on my way to the airport to catch a flight to Bahrain, where I had been invited to speak on the one hundredth anniversary of Gandhiji's return to India from South Africa, when my family rang to say that the usual suspect had gone bonkers on his TV channel lambasting me for something I had said to a TV agency earlier in the day in connection with the terrorist attack in Paris. As I hold this hysterical humbug in the uttermost contempt, I have not bothered to find out what the anchor was screaming about, but I do believe that in justice to myself, I should clarify my position to readers who may have been misled by what he has distorted and misrepresented. I was as horrified as you to hear of 12 lives being lost in the armed assault on a Paris satirical weekly for their repeatedly sneering at the Prophet of Islam (PBUH) and running cartoons denigrating him and the religion he has brought to hundreds of millions of families the world over. That such horror at terrorism was not just my reaction as a non-Muslim to the Paris outrage, but widely shared by Muslims too was brought home to me by a statement issued by a collegium of Imams and preachers of Bahrain who said: "Violence and extremism have always been - and still are - the biggest enemies of Islam, and contravene its teachings, tolerance and genuine precepts. All countries should take unified stances against terrorism. We call for the need to devise a unified international strategy to combat its forms and manifestation everywhere." That precisely reflects the position taken by the Dar-ul-Uloom. It precisely reflects my own personal position. To go by the Congress President's reaction, it also reflects my party's position: "The Congress President, Smt Sonia Gandhi, has condemned the cowardly and dastardly terror attack on Media in Paris. Shocked at the audacity of the gruesome act, Smt Gandhi said that extremism and intolerance will never be able to curb freedom of expression and will only result in perpetuation of violence." What then is the controversy about? It is about my describing the incident as a "backlash" to the War on Terrorism. That is not a justification of terrorism. It is an explanation. The distinction is important. I condemn terrorism. I do not commend it. If, however, war is declared on terrorists, it is stupid to imagine that the terrorists will take it lying down; inevitably they will hit back - that is a consequence we have to be prepared for. Charlie Hebdo, the satirical weekly, was so obviously on the hit list that it was virtually inviting a reaction week after week. The threat to the Editor was so palpable that he had been personally provided with just about the highest level of security that France could offer. Why the magazine's office was not protected with an adequate posse of armed security is being investigated.  But it also reflects the mind-set that thinks the West can mount a war and get away with little or no loss to themselves. The West is so militarily powerful and so technologically superior that it is able to unleash an unequal war in which their resources in money and machines cannot be matched even remotely by those whom they are combating. Therefore, terrorists resort to an asymmetrical response. They target non-combatants by way of avenging themselves on those whose war machines kill - daily - scores, hundreds, even thousands of the non-combatants in whose midst the terrorists live and shield themselves. A dead innocent is a dead innocent. Terrorists deliberately target the innocent. The War on Terrorism does not target innocents. It kills them indiscriminately by way of what is delicately called "collateral damage". But the loved ones and the community are equally affected - whether the killing is deliberate or incidental. The rage is the same. The urge to revenge is the same. For, as Gandhi said - and I quoted him to the TV agency - "Violence begets violence". The West is near perfecting the art of killing their enemies (plus "collateral damage") without risking their own lives. When eight American body bags returned from Somalia, Bill Clinton immediately called off the operation "Black Hawk Down". When eight Pathan bodies of helpless mothers, hapless children, and innocent by-standers lie in the midst of the carnage wrought by a Drone attack, the wailing families do not react differently. They seek justice, each in his or her own way. The Drone wins out because even if it is downed, as it is unmanned, no American family is left with a tear in its eye. When terrorists attack, they know they are going to be killed - or kill themselves. They take the vicious consequences of their vicious action. The Drone just flies away - to come back another day. Till even the First World War, war was fought on the terrain of war - the battle-field. Those who died or got injured were soldiers. Civilians only accidentally got in the way. That changed when the Germans started assassinating mayors of towns where snipers shot at German soldiers. It horrified the world and contributed more to Britain coming in against Germany than perhaps any other single action. Not even into the Thirties had men been desensitized to the atrocity of civilian beings killed in armed attack. Picasso earned eternal fame because his painting captured and symbolized the horror experienced by all civilized people at the aerial bombing of the Spanish village of Guernica. But by the Second World War, these niceties were abandoned. The terror opened by the Nazis through their Blitzkrieg on England, followed by their merciless genocide of Jews in the East European countries they occupied, started the process of desensitizing the hitherto-unknown horror of innocents being mown to death. Stalingrad finally dulled sensitivities to the point where Churchill could order the bombing of Dresden and kill more innocents in a single night than all the terrorist attacks since 9/11 and after. Truman's atom bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki removed the final constraints on sparing non-combatants the terrible fate of the battle-field. Since then, it has been open house for those with the military means to do so. I was posted as a young diplomat to Hanoi in the middle of the US-Vietnam war. Day after day, twice a day, US Air Force planes would pound the city without regard to civilian habitation or military target, shooting to death and severely injuring any living being - man, woman or child - they could fit into their sights. Uncounted millions died. Many were non-combatant civilians. A young British colleague said to me that American U-2s flying at such speed that they could cross the country in 10 minutes at a height of 60,000 feet could take a photograph of the saucer I held in my hand that would be more accurate than my naked eye could see. "How," he asked, "do you think these guys on bicycles will ever drive them out?" The bicyclists did; they won. But only after millions of civilians had been slaughtered.  I condemn what happened in Paris with all the strength in my voice. It was dreadful. But I regard all forms of terrorism, especially by armed force that takes the lives of non-combatants as equally - perhaps even more -  terrible. That is why my heart bleeds when 1,500 Palestinians are killed in their homes by bombs rained on them from the skies because they have the temerity to ask for the right to return to their homeland. The Modi government had little or nothing to say about that outrage. It is this lack of balance in the BJP's approach to terrorism that fills me with dread and despair. Most of us Indians, except the fringe lunatics of the BJP-RSS-Sangh Parivar, have learned millennia ago to live with diversity, indeed to celebrate our diversity, for out of it is forged our unity as a nation. For the West, however, diversity is a totally new experience. They have been compelled for economic reasons to import millions of Third World labourers, and since an arc of Arab countries lies immediately south of France on the other littoral of the Mediterranean, most of France's imported labour comprises Muslims from the Maghreb. France wants them to become Frenchmen as if the Arabs had fostered 1789 and never been subjected to colonial rule. The Arab Muslims wish to remain themselves, notwithstanding their having emigrated to France for the same economic reasons that have led to France and other Western countries importing them in such large numbers. Hence, stupid measures like insisting that no Muslim schoolchild in France may wear the hijab that her sisters wear in their home countries will result in a backlash.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Now we know the reason, why we are at the bottom as far as our foreign relations are concerned.  The author has been a diplomat and has been representing us abroad and see where we are.  This is not the first time, author has made such statements.  Let me remind the readers, it is the same person, who challenged Mr. Modi and invited him to sell tea at the meetings after Lok Sabha elections of 2014.  In fact, his this statement may be one of the reasons, why his party fared so badly in the contest.  Such people should not be permitted to represent the country in any forum, I am sure, chances of his harming our image are much more than his building a positive image of our country.

                            Height of arrogance is seen in every sentence of Iyer. Whichever subject,he brings BJP into picture. His inner conscience (if at all he has one) must be pricking that his statement on Modi(tea wala) has cost very dearly to CONgress. Let his intellectual if at all he has any, should be used for a constructive criticism &amp; not blabber something nonsense. Further if has guts let him sue the anchor whom he thinks has distorted his stupid statement.

Of course, when they come to India, you have to allow them all freedom.

                            If Mani Shankar's explanation is to be accepted then why did they attack the Jewish supermarket? What did these people did to the terrorists? Following his argument every terrorist attack is a "hit-back". So Mumbai attack is a "hit-back", recent school attack in Pakistan is a "hit-back". Please stop being apologetic for the terrorists actions.

                            Why you want to explain an attack ? People who attacked Charlie Hebdo were French Nationals and had all the rights to go to court if they felt offended. How would you explain attack on two ex prime ministers of this country Mrs Indira Gandhi and Mr Rajiv Gandhi ? Will you write in the same spirit on those two attacks ?

                            If we analyze the history of Indian politics post-independence, we can find a certain pattern to it which reveals the hidden agenda of the Congress party that ruled the nation for 80% of this period :<br/>
1. Congress party had declared "Garibi Hatao" way back in 1970s. Since then many decades have passed, hardly any reduction in the percentage of BPL population. If any small reduction has happened its either by a) Manipulating the definition - reducing the minimum earning of a person to categorize the individual as one living a BPL life. b) Death of a large number of them by now due to hunger.<br/>
2. Even till this decade Congress government had engaged in populist practices like subsidized cereals like one rupee per kg of rice, instead of massively engaging in massive developmental policies that can create more job opportunities for the people which inturn will help them earn a living. (Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a life time). <br/><br/>
If you just consider the above two, you can arrive at the actual motivation of the Congress party for all these years :<br/>
1) Promises like "Garibi Hatao" is just to get their votes and continually be in power.<br/>
2) But intentionally keep their main vote bank in poverty so that they can be allured very easily for conversion by missionaries and foreign agencies. Those in poverty are also more susceptible to superstitions and threats.<br/>
3) A person or family that is not in poverty is less susceptible to allurement, so poverty has always been the real vote bank of the Congress party, so keep poverty alive.<br/>
4) The Congress and the many anti-national agencies with the help of media are hand in glove to keep this vicious cycle going on forever and would never allow any non-congress government to function peacefully at the Center. <br/>
5) The opposition comprising the Congress party in cahoots with the media will make all efforts to deliberately and actively side track the developmental efforts by the government at the center.

                            Dear Mani, if that's the case Hindus in Pakistan should be blowing themselves up .Christians in Middle East should be planning suicide bombs. Thousand of Indians working in Middle East people of non Muslim faith should take on the streets and throw stones at the arabs. These people are not allowed to practice their religion or culture. What would be your say if a Hindu in Pakistan lays siege to a shopping mall killing muslims??? Don't you believe that minorities in these regions have a very strong reason to do this....

                            Mani Shankar Aiyar's explanation is moronic as usual. He has been a pathetic apologist for barbarians even to the extent that rational Muslims won't. He should go and spend time with Boko Haram, ISIS in explaining his apologist theories. When the world should show zero tolerance in rooting out terrorism, it's unfortunate that so called pseudo intellectuals in India suffer from verbal diarrhea and inflame the issue

                            Mani loses no opportunity to suck up to Madamjee, by overemphasizing how Sonia condemened the attack. Well so did most of the world and also leaders in the BJP. Also to attack the so-called fringe leaders only of the RSS-BJP etc shows again how disllusioned he is. The world is more at peril with the likes of an Owaisi or the separatists from Kashmir. Again his bias comes very clearly in the article where he cannot but help himself in BJP Bashing and Sucking up. <br/><br/>

                            As usual an articulate and well written article, which is beyond the understanding of the anchor referred to (Kharab Duraiswamy).  I can't understand how anybody comes on his channel and why anybody watches his rants, as the discussion is like that in a fish market, and the said anchor carries out an Inquisition.  NDTV is far more balanced in it's approach.

                            your justification proves your guilty.<br/><br/>
As per you, no country should declare war against terrorism else such incident would happen?<br/><br/>
Because of some side effects, one should not take medicine, allow to spread deices in whole body and eventually die because of it..!   What kind of logic this?<br/><br/>
And yes, what would have been your reaction if such incident would have associated with Hindu extremist?

                            The stooge of the congress has spoken again, criticising and cribbing as always! That's what he is good at, after all.  Remember people, this is the same congress party which allowed corruption to grow rampant, which caused us humiliation in the CWG , and has always believed in appeasing the minority at the cost of Hinduism. Because of their inaction, our armed forces are facing severe shortage , and the country's security is at risk . And then this fellow has the audacity to praise and defend terrorists. Truly he is a modern day Jaichand!

Please stop this nonsense, Week on week, this mans opinion is such a waste of time. Mr.Iyer has lost it all. He only spreads hatred and nothing else. What has BJP and Sangh Parivar got to do with Charlie Hebdo attack, why bring them in this. Or atleast show all the comments posted for his writeup and this man if has any respect should stop writing. Cheers

Coming to media: Why not you " intelligentsia" jointly black list few arrogant media channels instead of craving for TV  time?

                            I think this Mani guy is misguided n ill informed about the whole matter to even start commenting on what is happening around the world. To call it a fight of ISLAM against the west or a reaction of Muslims against the "war on terror" is trying to justify these actions...... he may choose to call it "explanation" (not justification - so what ? Semantics be damned). He quotes Gandhiji - violence begets violence. Yes true, but he (Bapu) also went on to say "and eye for an eye only goes on to make the world blind". Maybe Mani dint understand the import of that sentence. Revenge as an "explanation" or "justification" is no answer to solve any issue. INTROSPECTION may be. Deep introspection by all -- WHY IS THIS HAPPENING..... WHAT IS THE BEST FIT SOLUTION......CAN THEIR BE A DIALOGUE, A GENUINE GIVE N TAKE DIALOGUE TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHERS NEED ?? Be it by the powerful or the weak (but not so mild). Violence never solved any problem........it generally has only created more violence.

                            What Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyar said in reference to Charlie Hebdo attack can only come from a manured person of the caliber of Mr. Aiyar. It is beyond the capability of Arnab Goswamy to understand them. If Arnab had little bit of intellect, he would not have resorted to shouting tactics he indulges in when he anchors the Times Now shows. It is even bigger puzzle how times management have tolerated him over the years. He is not worth calling journalist. Hence, he has no business criticizing Mr. Aiyer for his comments.

However, my question is, how other religions will react if the same assault is made with their religious figures as they did with Prophet of Islam (PBUH) and running cartoons denigrating him and the religion he has brought to hundreds of millions of families the world over. Let see how the world will react. (keep in mind the agitation across India took place as a reaction to PK movie.)

Thanks again for your impartial views.

                            Point 1. Charlie Hebdo makes fun of all religions and disliked by fanatics of all religions. But was attacked by only the Islamic fanatics. No direct threat from others.<br/>
Point 2. This was an attack in reaction to satire on religious figures. Mr Iyer somehow related it to Gaza and Drone attacks. Deliberately confusing the context.<br/>
Point 3. This same Mr Iyer was fanatically opposing Hindu Right wing when MF Hussein drew Hindu Gods in nude. But feels apologetic on Charlie Hubdo drawing Islamic figures.<br/>
Point 4. somehow, found a way to bash BJP . Hillarious<br/>
Overall, he is an apologist who is a fanatic. Thinks that St. Stephens education has given him some additional piece of Intelligence. sorry Mr. Iyer, it was some other generation. Now, every street guy is smarter than you.
