Headline::::Hanging Yakub Memon Makes Us Murderers Too



DateTime::::2015-07-30T16:28:00+05:30




                                The news of the hanging of Yakub Memon has been greeted across the country with reactions ranging from dismay to scarcely-concealed bloodlust. I joined the public debate by expressing my sadness that our government has hanged a human being, whatever his crimes may have been. State-sponsored killing diminishes us all, I added, by reducing us to murderers too. I stressed that I was not commenting on the merits of this or any specific case: that's for the Supreme Court to decide. My problem is with the principle and practice of the death penalty in our country.
The overwhelming evidence suggests that the death penalty cannot be justified as an effective instrument of the state. Look at the numbers: there's no statistical correlation between applying the death penalty and preventing murder. About 10 people were executed from 1980 to 1990 for the offence of murder under section 302 of the India Penal Code, but the incidence of murder increased from 22,149 to 35,045 during the same period. Similarly, during 1990-2000, even though about 8 people were executed, the incidence of murder increased from 35,045 to 37,399. However, during 2000-2010, only one person was executed and the incidence of murder decreased from 37,399 in 2000 to 33,335 in 2010. No correlation: QED.
The death penalty does not actually deter an individual from committing an offence. In fact, studies show that an individual is rarely aware of the legal implications of his acts - in other words no criminal decides not to commit a crime because he is aware that a death sentence might follow. Additionally, the ambiguous application of the "rarest of the rare" principle enunciated by the Supreme Court further disables an individual from determining what offence would actually lead to a sentence of death penalty, and what would instead lead to life imprisonment. For any punishment to be an effective deterrence, it is important for ordinary people, especially potential criminals, to understand a clear relation between an offence and its punishment; but the odds of being hanged even for murder are very unpredictable indeed.
Studies have also proved that the application of the death penalty in India depends on various variables such as the biases of the judiciary, the arbitrariness of the Executive, social and communal biases, public outrage (especially against those complicit in terrorism or crimes against women involving rape and murder), the economic status of the accused (many more poor criminals are executed than well-off ones), and the quality of legal representation. The judicial use of expressions like "the collective conscience of the community has been shocked" to justify the death penalty testifies to the room for subjectivity and the grave risk that ill-informed media rhetoric can affect a decision.
Our existing criminal justice system leaves much room for errors and biases, especially because the system is created and implemented by humans. There is a possibility that the investigating agency is not able to collect sufficient and relevant evidence, the legal counsel is not competent enough to assess and defend his case, the judge is influenced by personal biases and media reports, and a lengthy criminal trial destroys the evidence. All such factors can never lead to an error-free assessment; it's a worrying basis to take a human life.
These factors leave much room for the arbitrary and disproportionate application of capital punishment. While 436 death sentences were imposed by the lower courts in the four years from 2010-13, 280 were commuted to life imprisonment and only two people were actually executed. However, all death sentences have not been commuted: many stay in an appalling limbo for decades. There are no comprehensive parameters to ascertain whether a person has been rightfully executed. It is morally difficult to justify taking such an extreme step when there is so much ambiguity about both the fairness of the death penalty and its efficacy.
The Law Commission had organized consultations just a couple of weeks ago to assess the effectiveness of the provisions governing the death penalty in India and the purpose of the penalty itself. This had been prompted by the Supreme Court taking note of the errors, the arbitrariness, and the judicial bias affecting the award of a death sentence. Unsurprisingly, based on the evidence and the opinions presented at the Law Commission's hearings, there was a general consensus on the inability of the courts to adopt a fair and non-discriminatory approach to the death penalty, and overwhelming opinion in favour of its abolition. 
I am told my comments on social media this morning were met by a response from the government that I should not be politicizing the issue. I don't see anything political in my statement of principle. But since politics has been mentioned, let me respond that it would be disingenuous to suggest that the imposition of the death penalty is free from any political motivations. After all, the final decision on mercy petitions or to commute a death sentence is taken by the political executive, which advises the President, who has the final say in deciding the execution of a death sentence but, is expected to act in accordance with the guidance of the Council of Ministers. The decision is therefore bound to be influenced by popular public opinion and political calculation.
The fundamental issue remains that innumerable studies and statistics support the view that there is no direct correlation between death penalty and deterrence. So why have it? The answer is simple: revenge and retribution. He killed (or participated in killing), therefore he should be killed. Is that a worthy act for a State? Should our society be practising the philosophy of 'an eye for an eye'? Revenge is not an acceptable justification for any governmental punishment. And the inept criminal justice system and the existing judicial and economic biases, which are further aggravated by inflamed public opinion, can hardly ensure the fair use of the death penalty, so we may in some cases be exacting revenge on the wrong people. Innocent, reformed and reformable people have been given the death penalty even though they no longer pose any serious danger to society.
There's only one possible conclusion as far as I'm concerned. The provisions governing capital punishment cannot be reformed. Therefore the death penalty should be abolished.(Dr Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Excuse me Mr Throor......kindly note that Yakub was hanged by the jury after following proper procedure and time....his trial was according to the system....he was given ample time and opportunity to defend himself ....if u politicians believe that  it was wrong then u r actually questioning our constitution....why ppl call u law makers??? When u r in power u remain too busy enjoying ur post and when u r in opposition u start questioning the system.....is it just a way of getting ppl's attention?? So stop calling us murderers and blame politicians like u ......pls let the law remain equal to everyone irrespective of one's caste, religion or status..... Yakub finally got what he deserved ....

                            With due respect Shashi Tharoor ji, I'll have to disagree with you. There is no correlation between death sentence and Murders because of two simple reasons. <br/>
1. It takes a long time for the judiciary to punish for an offense committed and the criminals are just are not afraid.<br/>
2. There are so many options given to someone committing a gruesome murder starting from a lower court to high court to supreme court and after that a mercy petition to President and then back to SC, the criminals are sure enough that in some or the other way they could escape with commuting to life imprisonment or lesser punishment.<br/><br/>
So, my opinion is speed up the trials and make the punishment harsher. Nothing wrong in giving more death penalties for something gruesome like child rape, planned murder and the one like Nirbhaya. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PUBLICIZE IT ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT IT WILL BE A CHILLING REMINDER TO THOSE THINKING OF DOING A CRIME.

                            Shashiji: Where were you when around 300 innocent lives were executed by this Memon group's in Bomb blast.  I feel hanging was correct. The capital punishment should be made to all murderrs whether they belong to Muslim or HIndu or Chrstians or any community.  Justice is equal to all.

                            I have the opinion that death penalty reinforces the belief that bad things happen to those who deserve it. This reinforces the contrary belief; that good things will happen to those who are 'good'. <br/><br/>
A lot of the countries that don't have death penalty are developed countries with very low crime rates and no real threat of terror acts. India's situation is very different and I don't think it is the appropriate time for India to remove the death penalty. India has a  high crime rate and a neighbour that is seeking every opportunity to make terror attacks in the country. Imagine if there was no death penalty you would have Ajmal Kasab still sitting in prison even though he killed so many innocent Indians and also foreigners for no fault of theirs. In fact they should try and speed-up the legal process where the death penalty has to be awarded and not delay it to 20-30 years this would probably make the death penalty more effective.

But Supreme court has clearly given the nod That should be final..So no more talks regarding Yakub menon;s hanging  because any criticism means dishonouring Supreme court  <br/>
Just because BJP Governemt is having the  guts to take such bold steps   Shashi Tharoor seems to be criticising it This is all Congress political stunt for attracting minority  and  political jealousy nothing more.

                            Cowardly that an active politician make this statement, 'Hanging Yakub Memon Makes Us Murderers Too' after the terrorist is hanged. Where were you since 2007 when the verdict was passed? Nothing less than trying to politicize and confuse people. Disappointed in you. <br/>
As a common man I have faith in our highest judiciary that based on their findings they did the right thing. We have had not more than 3 death penalties in the past 10 years.<br/>
Going forward, I agree that we should look into abolishing the death penalty.

                            Not all murders demand death penalty. If that's the case there will be hangings every day.It's only in the rarest of rare cases as said by SC. Army kills enemy at the border. Even this can be considered as state sponsored killing as per Sashi's logic. So, just defend enemy but don't attack and kill them?? BTW, where was you concise when Afzal was hanged by your government only to take on Modi.

Mass murderers and terrorists who kill without qualm, are vermins and do not deserve mercy or to be nursed , fed and allowed to live confortably, albeit in a cell, till their dying day. I totally and emphatically disagree with Mr. Tharoor .

                            with respect ..dear shashi sir ! in that case kasab got more right to live than any one..yakub was mature and educated charted accountant.and he know about surrounding .so he know exactly whom he is helping..and mumbai blast is not spontaneous one..without at least a month of plan it was impossible..and yakoob know that one .and yakub was not brainwashed or say he got his own thinking capacity....and ofcosue as a educated and mature human being yakub definetly know the impact of that blast and death of human lifes...so naturally yakub know it....<br/>
now in ajmal kasab case ...he was uneducated boy and was brainwashed by some one against other human being..and was drugged to kill other innocnet human being ...or say he was one of remote control toy controlled by mature terorist ....so in a logic ..if ajmal kasab was as much educated as yakub memon...ajmal kasab may not  killed other human , and he may not fall to trap of brainwashing...so ajmal kasab got punishment for the sin committed by those who were holding the remote control.....now compare educated yakubs fault with uneducated kasabs fault withiout his knowledge ..<br/>
i request shashi sirs honest reply on this.. <br/><br/>
my coment is just on argument..neither iam supporting death penalty or not against judgement of supreme court..

                            How an educated and illustrious man like Shashi oppose death penalty and compare it to murder. He has no suggestions on how to prevent heinous crimes. He has no suggestions on how to deliver justice to those who loose their kith and kin in barbaric crimes. Until there is an alternative to death penalty which can be an effective deterrent, there is no way death penalty can be abolished. Most barbaric is the act of terrorism and it has a huge implications other than loss of innocent lives. If this is not the rarest of rare ground for death penalty, what else on earth can be considered?  The argument that the ruling dispensation can misuse the right to reject will arise only after the highest court has delivered the death penalty after the due process of law and hearing both sides of arguments and considering the evidence available. There is no interference from the executive in the judicial process. At least at the Supreme Court level. Every time hanging happens, the debate on death penalty surfaces and after that dies down, why can't politicians and experts from all fields sit across the table and debate this issue and hammer out a solution instead of pointing finger at each other.

An article written well. I have few issues with your line of argument. You arrive at the conclusion that death penalty is not a deterrent and also that it tantamount to state becoming a murderer. Look at the following situations and reply what course of action should be taken?<br/><br/>
1. A terrorist holding few people at a gun point and threatening to shoot them and there are police personnel with weapons at the scene. Should the police shoot the terrorist or not?. If No, why should and what for the police is being given the arms?. If Yes, are the police becoming a murderer?.<br/><br/>
2. Imagine the situation in the border, when Pakistan Army is shooting in order to send the terrorist in to our side. Are we to retaliate or not?<br/><br/>
3. A person threatened with his/her life, can he/she save this/her life when only option is to attack the other person?<br/><br/>
For your information in Singapore, there is a capital punishment for trafficking in Drugs. Their philosophy is to eradicate the social hazard by imposing the maximizing the penalty.

                            Would you have told the same thing about the killers of Mahatma Gandhi and Indira Gandhi? Seems you are telling this just because he was a muslim. Please rise above petty politics of minority appeasement. Your speech in UK was wonderful, really appreciate it, but don't agree with your viewpoint on this topic at all. <br/><br/>
If the acts of a person are like that of barbaric animals, he should also be treated like an animal irrespective of his religion. Such people don't deserve a proper funeral; they should be cremated the way it happened for Osama. You should be thankful that the government arranged a proper funeral for Yakoob.

                            Sir, While I agree with your statistics that the number of death penalties awarded have not reduced the number of crimes, the same statistics also apply to other forms of punishments that the court has provided. Which means the crime rate is not getting reduced with whatever form of punishment the judiciary has been awarding so far. So does that mean that we should do away with all forms of punishments? When you say taking a life is inhumane, then keeping a person in confinement is also inhumane. So, should we do away with prisons and police too?

                            One should see the crime rate in Saudi Arabi and China where the strict punishments are awarded.  In India death penalty is only awarded but not executed.  One a death penalty is awarded the accused as well as the President and the Supreme Court should be given a time frame to resolve mercy plea as well as curative plea.  I think a time frame of 12 months should be sufficient.  The convict should be given three months to file both the mercy plea/curative plea.  Again it should be clearly stated as to who should file the mercy plea.  The convict or the wife/brothers of the convict.

                            The correlation between the number of death penalties and homicides is so low in India precisely because there is a very high probability of perpetrators literally getting away with murder. A more apt comparison is China, where the death penalty is a much more effective deterrent of crime. Homicide rates in that country are one-fourth that in India. So the statistical argument posed here does not really have any merit.<br/><br/>
The issue of capital punishment is rather an ethical-philosophical debate, with strong points of view on either side but no 'correct' answer...

                            Purely on the stats that Mr. Tharoor has provided:<br/><br/>
Total murders (1980, 1990, 2000, 2010) = 22149, 35045, 37399, 33335<br/>
India population in billions (1980, 1990, 2000, 2010) = 0.699 0.8689, 1.042, 1.206<br/><br/>
Therefore, # murders per billion people (1980, 1990, 2000, 2010) = 31686, 40332, 35891, 27641<br/><br/>
Let's relate the capital punishment causality to these per capita numbers. Given there was a spike in per capita murders between 1980 and 1990, it is logical that there had to be 10 hangings. It potentially acted as a deterrent for the next decade (1990 to 2000) whereby the per capita murders actually reduced by 11%. The effectiveness of the deterrence tool (i.e. capital punishment) has been such that in the next decade (2000 to 2010), not only the per capita number, but the absolute number of murders has itself declined- which is remarkable! Still no correlation, Mr. Tharoor?<br/><br/>
For something to be a deterrent, the dependent variable associated with it (in this case, murder), needs to be seen after a lag, which I show above. Also, absolute numbers of murders make no sense in a growing population. So your metric itself was not meaningful.

                            This country  is not ready for abolishing death penalty yet. First Human development Index needs to improve and then law of the land needs to prevail without political affiliations. After this is achieved, we can think of abolishing death penalty. We cannot pay the cost of exempting terrorists from death penalty.<br/><br/>
Most Countries that have abolished death penalty are evolved and citizens mostly abide by the law of the land. Also law of the land is meticulously monitored and implemented by courts. It is going to be a long time before, Bharat can even think of doing away from death penalty..

                            I am not for or against capital punishment. Executions are (in my opinion) not so much a deterrent, correctly pointed out in the article, but is done to assuage public anger for a heinous act of violence. Yakub Memon was executed as a public show of retribution for the Mumbai attacks. Our dysfunctional justice system cannot in any certainty be 100% sure of a person's guilt. For that reason alone I don't think the death penalty should have been applied.

                            What a foolish thought it's. Death sentence is not to kill innocent people, its to kill people who committed murders. When Yakub knows that 100s of innocent people will be killed, he still executed the job of bomb blast. What about Kasab? Killed brutally many innocent people. Go and ask the family of ATS chief and GM of Taj hotel who lost his 2 kids and wife on the fateful date of Mumbai terror attack. When you want to abolish capital punishment please provide alternate punishment for such criminals. Don't tell keep them in jail until their death. We don't want to provide high security to such people spending tax payers money. We can see what's happening to the rapists. Only issue in our judicial system is delay in closing the case, otherwise for country like India, capital punishment is the one and the only tool to bring in fear on such criminals. Tharoor read the data wrongly, because of 5s and 10s of hanging, crime rate is increasing. <br/><br/>
Stop this argument and allow law to take its own course. We don't want to convert jails as save heaven for criminals to live until their death. We know what kind of 5 STAR treatments are given in Indian jails !!!

I agree with you fully. I also hate it that the US applies the death penalty 1000's of of percent times more than in India. When we kill a human being no matter how dastardly he/she is, the bad guys and evil win! I ALSO BELIEVE THAT MURDERS SHOULD BE LOCKED UP AND NOT FREED TO DO HARM AGAIN - unless proven innocent.<br/><br/>
All this evil has been brought to Mother India from the people across the border and the invaders over thousands of years.<br/><br/>
I pray that India has some peace - but not as long as deep evil surrounds us around our borders.

                            Hanging memon is not murder , it's a consensus desicion by the apex court represnting a society that this person cannot continue to live in society. This is a way of eliminating the criminal aspect from the human life when the crime committed is so horrific that its thought that this person is beyond reform. You cannot say that death sentence should be abolished and let criminals against society to live.

                            i have another question which is bothering me. <br/>
Lot of eminent personalities have talked about against hanging of Mr memon saying that it is as good as murder by state . It is being called as killing by state.<br/>
 Now , if a militant / terrorist attack and start killing innocent citizens ( let us consider Gurdaspur attack ) , what should be the state response ? if the state fight back -- and in the process the terrorists are killed -- would it amount to state killing ? State has enormous resources in terms of man power , arms and ammunition , logistics support So eventually , the terrorists will run short of resources to fight back -- and finally will be shot to death -- <br/>
Should the mandate be -- no killing of terrorist ? After all -- he / she is also human being -- so we are taking away a life -- may be with brutal force Will this action be termed as " high handedness of state ".<br/>
 Lastly sir , what should be the penalty for heinous crime / Or in a modern state , there should not be any severe punishment -- because someone in jail is having all facilities , including parole to visit the family and friends ( case of Mr Sanjay Dutt). He / She is well fed , good medical facility , TV , magazines , may not be very good bed ,  news papers , and i do not know what else is given.<br/>
You have talked about merciful state like -- Norway giving 21 years of jail term <br/>
Sir , why 21 years at all ??Why not 11 years -- or for that matter why not 1 year<br/>
Sir , mercy can be -- no jail term what so ever <br/>
So where do we draw the line ??<br/>
 What ever crime is committed , how much henious/ revolting  it may be , state ( means we , tax paying citizen, including you also  ) will take care of the criminal's well being and after some time would be released.<br/>
I would be extremely thankful to receive your views in this regard Thanks<br/>

                            Mr. Shashi Tharoor, your views notwithstanding, swift and timely delivery of justice (death penalty included) is what it takes to ensure deterrence of crime. This should have been the priority, which successive governments in India have failed to deliver to its citizens to ensure a safe society with a low crime rate.

                            Dear Sir,<br/>
I have recently developed keen interest in Indian Politics and you are one of the leaders that I wait to hear from key issues of national interest. Might I also add that it has nothing to do with you being a Keralite, but more to do with the fact that you come across as a well read and an articulate person who speaks his mind.<br/>
 I heard your comments yesterday with regards to death penalty and have been pondering on it since…<br/>
To start with, surely you could have timed this better than put this point across now, as it is a sensitive matter and could easily incite strong reactions across communities and political parties? Let me set this aside for the time being and assume that there was no political motivation in commenting on this issue. Irrespective, I have the below questions for you.<br/>
•	Are you suggesting that the death penalty be abolished completely for all crimes including rape, mass murder, other forms of "rarest of rare cases" etc? I did read your point that we don't have clarity on what a "rarest of rare case", will his /her crime be punished with death penalty and that one does not keep death penalty in mind whilst committing a crime etc…You can argue that a terrorist is prepared to die and that the death penalty is not a deterrent. I can buy this argument to some extent, but I don't agree that this applies to other cases of heinous crimes. If a strong law/response is created and applied swiftly (Once an accused is proven guilty beyond doubt), I dare say that it will have an impact. We really can't be looking at correlations or the lack of it as suggested by you, as there are other factors that come into play. It's a larger debate.<br/><br/>
•	Taking this further, let's assume that we abolish the death penalty for a case like the Mumbai terror attacks ( for arguments sake), what is the guarantee that we might not  see another terror attack or a hijack case wherein the terrorists or hijackers hold people to ransom, for the release of a dreaded criminal? I am not pointing to this particular case, but is this not a logical assumption? Has it not happened earlier? What plans will the government have in place to counter such moves? Do we go the American way of "No Negotiation with Terrorists"? Your logic would then perhaps again ask for us to show restraint, not go with a counter offensive and perhaps negotiate with them as we possibly don't want to kill them as it's against humanity and will not differentiate us from them?<br/><br/><br/>
•	Why would we want to spend Jail space and finances on keeping hard core criminals alive for years with the risk mentioned above? Who pays for all this?<br/><br/>
•	You mentioned that "Our existing criminal justice system leaves much room for errors and biases, especially because the system is created and implemented by humans. There is a possibility that the investigating agency is not able to collect sufficient and relevant evidence, the legal counsel is not competent enough to assess and defend his case, the judge is influenced by personal biases and media reports, and a lengthy criminal trial destroys the evidence. All such factors can never lead to an error-free assessment; it's a worrying basis to take a human life" <br/>
My understanding of the court is that no innocent will be hanged and that you are innocent until proven guilty? Also, if there are flaws in the system, should we not look at minimizing/eliminating them? I thought that's what educated humans do? Did we not learn lessons from air crashes and make flying a safe mode of travel? Do we not look at mistake proofing and striving for excellence in all spheres of life?<br/>
These are a few queries that I have come up with and I am hopeful to hear from you. Perhaps I have misunderstood your statements, but a clarification would be appreciated.<br/>
On a different note, your talk at Oxford recently was impressive and showed your preparation and oratorical skills again. You are right, hope we see such open , honest discussions at our parliament too where everyone lets the other express their views, without interrupting and continues to respect the other, in- spite of a difference in opinion!<br/><br/>
Conclusion<br/>
I also hopeful that the Supreme Court would have done her due diligence before pronouncing the verdict and we should respect the law of the land, instead of assuming that they were swayed by inflamed public opinion.<br/>
There have been other discussions and mention that Yakub surrendered and helped us with intel for which he was to be spared from the death penalty. If so, I am again hopeful and fairly confident that the Supreme Court would have looked into this before pronouncing her verdict. <br/>
There is also logical argument from many quarters that there are other cases that need to be dealt with with firmer resolve and I have confidence in the law of the land, that this will also happen<br/><br/>
Thank you all for your patience and my sincere apologies in advance, to anyone I might have hurt unintentionally.<br/><br/>
Disclaimer:<br/>
My query to Mr. Tharoor and my comments are not based on any political or religious affiliations, but more from a citizen to a leader that he follows. I respect all religions equally and am not making any statements on this particular case, as I am not well read on this topic.<br/>
These are my personal views with limited knowledge and not that of the organization that I work at.

                            22,149 (1980) murders and only 10 death penalties. Therefore, the murder toll increased to 35,045 (1990).<br/><br/>
Similarly, 35,045 murders (1990) and only 8 death penalties. That's why it increased further.<br/><br/>
Had All of them been hanged.... the toll would have been reduced.

                            Its pathetic that high and mighty in this company is only talking about death penalty, while the victims do not even have a feeble voice. I guess, before being utopian in thought, it would be nice if all these opinion makers come up with a concrete plan to address the issues faced by the victims of such terrorist acts, which are like waging war on the country. It is surprising non even ONE from the Op-ed writing elite thought it fit to make a personal commitment to work for victims. Their hollow noise about death penalty is severly one sided and therefore pathetic....

                            Mr. Tharoor,  what Yakub &amp; co did was waging war against India / Indian people. they did not attack police / soldiers but common people. with any standard in war also common people are not attacked. If still you want to defend your stance against this death penalty then certainly there is some deceptive thinking. And the same is not good for India as nation.<br/>
If you are debating death penalty in domestic crimes, the same is debatable. I am sorry to say that whatever regards I had for you has eroded after your this statement.

                            I thought you are intelligent but you are little short, as your Europe model living style and our Indian ground reality is completely different. Every Indian prison the convicted are enjoying prison life with the support of people like you, if we abolish death penalty then crime in India will increase 100%. We have to abolish death penalty once we reach same living standard of Europe &amp; America.

                            correct. there should not be a death penalty at all. No one in the world has moral right to kill another living thing.

                            I don't know why the government made such a great haste to hang Memon at the noose! Why should a man get punishment twice for a deed? He had spent behind the bars for more than a decade &amp; after that still _hang to death_? Ridiculous!! If anyone shows cruelty, does it mean you should have to do the same?? Then what's the difference between you &amp; him?? I'm really frustrated at the capital punishment? Has it stopped crime as said by Mr. Tharoor? Don't know. He may have been involved in a heinous deed but by hanging him, as again noted by Mr. Tharoor, aren't we involved too?? Really a travesty of justice...

                            You are missing one important yardstick... "Rarest or rare crime" is what attracts a capital punishment. Prove that 1993 bomb blast wasn't a rarest of rare crime and I'll join the pool applauding your thoughts.

                            India is not at the stage yet to remove death penalty completely. If that is the case then what about war on terror. What about public opinion and demands. At the end of the day we are in democracy and what matters is public demand and opinion. I am not saying that death penalty is the only weapon to fight this. But occasionally you do require this sort of punishment. E.g. Kasab was hanged. Surely no one would think that giving him death penalty was wrong decision. You can imagine what would public be thinking, had Kasab's petition for mercy been accepted!

                            Well, I'm not arguing against or for death penalty. Society will always be divided over the argument. But my problem is standard of this article. Personally I always look forward for Mr. Tharoor's column. The empirical argument with number of execution and number of murder is so poorly relates, it makes this argument ridiculous. Similarly we can get data over number of (dfrnt types) punishment and number of crimes committed. And extension of same argument will prove system of punishment futile and then in turn entire justice system in preventing crime. Mostly Mr. Tharoor used to be balanced, by providing comparable other data. But here, he don't need to look at the data of USA, China, Saudi Arabia on one side and Finland, Sweden etc. on the other side. Sorry to say that, but this looks like written by Ms. Vrinda Karat or Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyar, if not Shobha de or Ashutosh Rana.

                            Does capital punishment serve as a deterrence, is something that can be debated for eternity. If nothing else, capital punishment does achieve one thing - elimination of a person who does not deserve to exist in the society; without whom the society would be a significantly safer &amp; better place to live. Agree that this should apply only in the rarest of rare cases, but it should be executed wherever it applies.

                            Mr Tharoor, What should be the deterrant then? yes as a principle one can discuss merits of hanging? but what to do to people who indulge in mass killings?             what do you think about America then, they have dropped atom bombs and even now for state security keep bombing in others areas of world!!! then you should criticize them  too!!!                             And the timing of your article.. why did not congress abolished hanging when they were in Govt.???? your article may be politically motivated!!!

                            That punishment is not a deterrent for a crime is logically applicable to the capital penalty, then it should also be applicable to other forms of punishment including life imprisonment. As you have said, there is no guarantee of a convict being given the death penalty even if he has committed murder. Similarly, there is no guarantee of a convict being imprisoned for life even if he has committed a serious offence. All that lies in the strength of the prosecution, the quality of legal representation and judge's interpretation of the arguments; all of which are variables over which the state has little or no control, and this is true around the world. So, going by this logic, even life imprisonment is not a worthy punishment because it incarcerates a person for life without ever having served as a deterrent to him or anybody else. SO, why do we need harsh punishments at all? The purpose is to reform the individual, which is obviously hardly served in such cases! That again brings the question of which is the more cruel form of punishment, life imprisonment or death? That is a subjective question, which only a convict on death row can answer. The only reason a death penalty can be offered is when it looks inevitable; i.e. when there seems to be no reasonable hope of the individual being able to reform himself and resume a normal life in society, either because he seems to be an obsessive criminal or because the grave nature of his crime is such that the society is unlikely to accept him back. Exile is perhaps the only other option.
