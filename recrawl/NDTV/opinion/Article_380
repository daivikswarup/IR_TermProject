Headline::::Why I'm Running Against Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi



DateTime::::2015-01-29T02:13:00+05:30



(Kiran Walia has taught Political Science at Delhi University for 32 years and thereafter been an MLA and Minister in the Delhi Government for 15 years.)I am often been asked why I decided to contest from the New Delhi constituency after 15 years of nurturing my earlier constituency of Malviya Nagar. The same people who ask me this question also provide the likely answers: it was a party decision which I could not refuse; the seat is a more comfortable one because of former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit's base and deep roots (despite the loss in 2013); it offers a middle class electorate which has, since the last assembly elections, shifted base from the AAP; and so on and so forth. None of these reasons are correct. I chose to fight from the New Delhi seat because of an entirely different set of reasons. Reasons that have to do with the nature of Delhi politics since the last election in 2013.I have been in politics for the last 35 years, first as a Delhi University activist and later as a legislator and as a minister in the Delhi government. In both my avatars, I have first and foremost upheld the position of our statutory bodies and institutions as created under the provisions of the Indian constitution. When in doubt about actions or policies, the constitution has been my measure of right and wrong. The constitution guarantees certain protections under the law and to basic human rights. The oath to the Constitution taken by public servants and ministers binds them to upholding the law. And this is where Mr Kejriwal, a former civil servant, has gotten it so terribly wrong.Since the emergence of the anarchist politics of the AAP, I fear that these rights are increasingly being violated, threatened and eroded by Mr Kejriwal. The unwarranted attack on African women by none less than former Law Minister Somnath Bharti under the AAP dispensation is a shocking example of the blow to our institutional foundations. If the AAP had no regard for human rights of residents of this city, it had even less for the position of India across the civilized world where such an act would have been punishable under law. However noble his intent, Mr Kejriwal repeatedly exhorting citizens to indulge in bribe-taking as a solution to dealing with corrupt officials is astonishing in that it wipes out with one stroke the difference between a law-abiding citizen and a criminal. The citizens of Delhi need to decide if the boundaries between right and wrong should be so summarily collapsed, and if the party that does so is the right party for the future of Delhi.Secondly, I have served the citizens of Delhi for the last 15 years as a member of Delhi's Legislative Assembly and as a Minister. I have been witness to the astounding transformation of the city in these 15 years. The city is crying for strong leadership and the vision to develop it into a world-class capital. In January 2014, AAP had a chance to move ahead on this agenda. They had a great opportunity to prove themselves and deliver on the promises they had made. But their promises were absolutely hollow and clearly they put little thought behind their accusations about inflation, about bringing down the costs of bijli and paani in Delhi, and about having an egalitarian and sustainable policy of gains for all residents of the city. Their policy amounted to taking from Paul to give to Peter. It is all very well to shout from the rooftops about seductive schemes, but an entirely different story to implement those in government. Devoid of any planning whatsoever, the AAP government fell flat. The bizarre and amusing spectacle of the AAP whilst in power in Delhi convinced me that the future of Delhi, as India's capital and as its foremost city, is at stake. My decision to fight from the New Delhi constituency is based on the fear that a victory for Mr Kejriwal will only extend the irrational and unsound policies of his party.With every day that passes, I am convinced that we live in a country and in an age where one of the biggest protections we have comes not just from the freedom of expression, but also from the ideal of civility in public life which protects us from libelous statements and outright falsehoods. Not since the depraved days of McCarthyism in the US in the 1950s have we seen irresponsible politicians wave a sheaf of random papers and threaten to "expose" opposition colleagues as we have with Mr Kejriwal's expose politics. Does Delhi need this brand of crazy politics? Are we entering a phase where no one will take good decisions because of the fear of outrageous and unfounded accusations of corruption and malversation? Are all politicians, government officers, bureaucrats, media, judges and police corrupt, as Mr Kejriwal would have us believe? Do we want a "Mamata Banerjee model of governance" in India's capital city? The people of Delhi need good governance implemented through existing institutions and based on the rule of law, rather than an anarchist model of street protests by the government against itself!! A final and convincing argument for taking on the New Delhi seat has been a sense of foreboding given the hubris of the AAP. When a Law Minister of the AAP commands the judiciary to present themselves to the government, then one is forced to consider whether the credentials of the AAP authorize it to govern at all. When the leader of the AAP views himself as beyond the reach of the Election Commission of India, one is forced to consider the value he places on the election process, a central aspect of democratic functioning. When a minister of the AAP gets into brawl over the right to passage on a Delhi street, one has to consider what she thinks of the rights of ordinary citizens. Mr Kejriwal's professed commitment to women's safety is a sham - in his 49 long days as CM he did not introduce any measure or even provide budgetary support to the existing schemes. Craving funds, every benefit for the aam aadmi, be it EWS admissions, treatment in private hospitals, pensions or food security was waylaid by a 49-day government that was high on noise and agitation, but miserably poor on governance. The portents for democracy broadly, and for the democratic space of the residents of this city, do not look bright.I am convinced that much rides on my decision to stop Mr Kejriwal in his tracks - the idea of Delhi's future and the fabric of democracy as we have known and cherished.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Very good arguments but it appears people are swayed away by the emotions and logic has long disappeared. AAP will form the next government and let's hope they serve Delhi better...otherwise Delhites have only themselves to blame.

                            I know why she is fighting from New Delhi. She would have lost from Malviya Nagar and would lose from New Delhi. Losing from new Delhi would be a face saver , as no one would have won against Kejriwal in New Delhi.

                            Arwind Kejriwal might have been having his shortcomings ,but attributing to him "anarchist politics" does not match the ground situation. Mismanagement something else but "anarchy" is just blowing the reality  out of proportion.

                            Kiran Ji, I am a loyal supporter of BJP, yet I do have a rational to think and act accordingly. You have point the basic flaws of AAP, your views are in tandem with all the civil citizens of our nation, APP &amp; AK is a bunch of bananas, not eatable nor feedable to the monkeys,  they can be left to rot . In civility i thank your party to have given them a chance to form a gov , what passed is un tellable history, but even now your party is not profusely opposing AAP, and it seems congress is playing second fiddle, your parties spokesperson are more in convulsion , I sincerely hope you win even if nupur looses. Wishes.

                            Dear Delhi Voters, From Hyderabad I humbly request all of you to vote for Congress &amp; please do not entertain other parties. I am sure most of you would have witnessed Development in Delhi which Congress has done in 15 years. There also few mistakes committed in these 15 years which every congress leader realises. You also would have witnessed how corrupt MCD is under BJP for last 15 years. Many of us can understand that not only Delhi but most of Indian electorate were misled by Team Anna &amp; his India Against Corruption team (AK, Bedi etc) in last Delhi elections &amp; also Lok Sabha Elections. I would request all of you to go through the speeches (IN youtube/net etc) by Team Anna (AK &amp; Bedi) &amp; also speeches by BJP Leaders/Sangh Parivar during IAC movement/Delhi Elections/Lok Sabha Elections &amp; you would easily note complete inconsistency in AAP &amp; BJP Leaders and how avasarvadi they are in changing voters mind share by effective utilisation of media. The hollow promises made by AAP in 49 days &amp; BJP @ Center in last 10 months cannot be implemented as their is no budget allocated for implementation of any of these promises. (Only name given). Most importantly &amp; unfortnately, Nirbhaya rape in Delhi has been used by BJP &amp; AAP to reach their selfish political ambitions. Now, is there any change in Delhi for the last 10 months under BJP led Central Government Rule? No. There are more than 50 rapes committed (To common man notice) in Delhi in last 10 months and it has become bad to worse &amp; why AAP/BJP is not agitating against them now. Have they promised any effective legislation for Women's safety in last 10 months. No..they are only trying to implement Legislation brought in by UPA after Nirbhaya case. Not only this. if you go through all BJP led Central Govt schemes you would not that they do not have any innovative ideas/schemes of their owen for welfare of people. They are only implementing the UPA Schemes with different name. It shows how involved/effective UPA was in Government for 10 years and how inffective/detached was BJP in opposition for 10 years from people's welfare. We also know how BJP polarises voters before elections (Trilokpuri, Muzaffarnagar etc) &amp; generates interest through PR activity selling PM's foreign visits or Internation Dignitaries India visits for their petty political gains. CONGRESS IS THE ONLY PARTY WHICH WORKS FOR MIDDLE &amp; LOWER CLASS OF PEOPLE &amp; WHICH DOES NOT BELIEVE IN MEASURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF COUNTRY THROUGH GDP GROWTH BUT BY ROLLING OUR POLICIES/SCHEMES AND ALSO ALLOTTING BUDGET FOR MEETING BASIC NEEDS OF COMMON MAN LIKE RIGHT TO FOOD, RIGHT TO EDUCATION, RIGHT TO INFORMATION, RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT, SECURITY TO AGRICUTURAL LAND &amp; MANY MORE RIGHTS PROVIDED TO US BY UPA. HUMBLE REQUEST TO ALL DELHI VOTERS - PLEASE VOTE FOR CONGRESS FOR CONTINUES DEVELOPMENT OF DELHI.
                         </div>

                            Kejariwal govt performance is one of the worst in Delhi but hardly voters considering that. In India still it is premature to consider votes are casted based on the actual performance of the party and its members unless it is too bad to forget. So Cong is getting punished for its utterly bad performance mainly due to flood of corruption scams and high uncontrolled food prices. Now to revive, it has to remove the old baggages that are like liabilities and making the Cong movement slow due to their burden. Now the generation has changed and old pattern of politics has changed and no buyer. All you have to do is be fast and take decisions rapidly and make corrections quickly. No one has patience to wait for ages to see how effectively you can take decisions. So individual performers in Cong will have hard time to convince voters why the party's govt at the centre and state were linked to series of scams and why it failed to create employment could not provide security to women and could not control price rise, etc. Voters are not ready to care for that party which could not care for them after given chances for many years consecutively both in the state and in the centre.

                            This lady has so much belief that she will talk and Indians will just listen.. as we have been used too for past 60+ years.. <br/><br/>
have we not seen attack on women in delhi, in the last 15 years of Congress government? have we not seen  suffering of women due to a govt official or politician in the country before? Should we then equally shunt Congress out of politics ?<br/><br/><br/>
Generation has changed,days have gone, where we used to pay the bribe and keep moving. days have gone, where we feel shy of society and not challenge the corrupt. If getting bribe is not so much of an issue for Congress, why is taking bribe by the citizen a big issue? Is this not the money of the public? Let them book every one who asks for bribe and then come to common man to preach about good and bad. <br/><br/><br/>
Running into the past 15 years, Congress had the Delhi's government... and if they had done even 50% good job, they would be still elected by the people.<br/>
The fact that they have been thrown out tells the tale, of what they have done.<br/><br/>
Are all politician and officials corrupt? I guess this is for her to answer... Why would she have any question on herself ?<br/><br/>
If the political class had ensured that the few corrupt among them have been punished and exposed, then people would have faith in the rest.. if they are protecting the corrupt then, what do we call these people ? Honest ... like our MMS ?

                            the question is a no brainer...Kiran Walia is standing from Delhi to dilute the votes of Kiran Bedi...all said and done AAP is a Congress stooge...though they try their best to show that they are against each other....so their joint endeavour is to defeat the BJP either by simple majority or by a coalition.....so getting a namesake to stand would definitely take away some of the votes meant for Kiran Bedi....and that might make the crucial difference to the 'majority' standings...'absolute'   'simple'....'horse stable...' etc....

                            So you mean that the people of New Delhi constituency should vote you only so that Kejriwal loses. Then why didn't you join BJP which at least has a chance to form the government. Why will people vote for Congress as they have absolutely no chance of forming the government? In fact by contesting against Kejriwal, you are cutting the votes of BJP candidate who is anyway not very strong. It is clear that you are not fighting BJP, then why don't just join them and fight against Kejriwal genuinely by supporting the BJP candidate from New Delhi constituency.
