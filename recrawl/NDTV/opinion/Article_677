Headline::::For Sushma Swaraj, Karmic Points Above Duty



DateTime::::2015-06-25T21:16:00+05:30




                                The marvelous thing about conflict of interest in India is how blissfully our political class is completely unaware of it. We are all reared in a culture where a good and upstanding pillar of society is identified by his fulfillment of his duty to his family, clan and caste before anything or anyone else. In a classic exchange earlier this year a prominent politician, criticized for favouring his son in an appointment, retorted: "Of course I favoured my son! Then whose son should I favour? A stranger's?"
       
No wonder Sushma Swaraj thought nothing of intervening with a foreign government in favour of an absconding Indian citizen, wanted by the law enforcement agencies of our own country. In any other democracy, even if such a matter had come to her desk, she would have been expected to recuse herself from all involvement because her husband and daughter happened to be the legal representatives of the person concerned. I doubt the thought of recusal even occurred to her. Favours, after all, are done for one's friends; why step back from an opportunity to do one?
       
A conflict of interest exists when any official's fiduciary responsibility to the obligations of his or her official position clashes with a personal interest, e.g. a sense of duty towards a friend. The Sushma case fits so obviously within that definition that it could almost be a classic example for a case-study on conflict of interest. But of course, she doesn't see it that way, and - though she didn't even keep her Foreign Secretary informed of her intervention, clinching proof that she knew she was doing something improper - nor does her government. 
I suspect Sushmaji genuinely persuaded herself that she had done the right thing, one that would win her much merit in the karmic balance-sheet. It was, after all, she says, a "humanitarian" gesture. The fact that its beneficiary happened to be partying (and posting pictures of himself doing so) in half the most expensive resorts of Europe did not, in her eyes, diminish the purity of her motives. And the fact that her own daughter was the lawyer of an individual whose passport was revoked in March 2011 (and whose challenge was rejected by a single judge in the Delhi High Court in January 2013) seemed irrelevant to her when she intervened. Or perhaps all too relevant!
To add to the conflict of interest, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had issued a notice to the same individual for foreign exchange violations of up to Rs. 425 crores; a "light blue corner notice" had been circulated to all Indian ports and airports for his arrest upon arrival. Did the Foreign Minister perceive it to be in her interest to help a government department fulfil its mandate, or was it more in her interest to protect and enable her husband's friend and her daughter's client? Conflict of interest, anyone?
Or take Vasundhara Raje Scindia. It turns out the Chief Minister of Rajasthan (then the once and future holder of that designation) also supported the same individual's residency application to the British authorities on the "strict condition that my [i.e. Raje's] assistance will not become known to the Indian authorities"! In other words, I wish to help my friend, but please do not reveal (especially to the Government of India) that I have done so. After all, the friend in question (a very questionable individual) had transferred Rs. 11.63 crore to Raje's son's company by valuing ten-rupee shares at a thousand times their worth. Could that imply a conflict of interest that would explain the extraordinary "unattributable" support for his "leave to remain" beyond the reach of Indian law enforcement in the UK? Conflict of interest? Perish the thought!
The Home Minister of India, no less, made it clear that such mundane considerations as conflict of interest do not apply to the exalted panjandrums of the NDA. "Resignations? That's for the UPA government, not for us," he declared. "There will be no resignations over such issues in the NDA." Conflict of interest is something that happens to other people - those who have a conscience. Not to us, who have been divinely ordained to rule as we see fit.
I hope some intrepid soul will take the entire issue to the Supreme Court and seek a direction that spells out conflict of interest duties and obligations. These must be enforceable, unlike the existing code of conduct for ministers, which was strongly upheld by the UPA but cheerfully ignored by the current government. 
When I joined the Government in May 2009 I was startled to be told by the Cabinet Secretary that I must relinquish every one of my advisory board positions - every single one of them honorary - because of a possible conflict of interest. When I pointed out that these mostly related to human rights and humanitarian organizations and educational institutions, he explained that no cause, however worthy, could benefit from the patronage of a Government minister, because a conflict of interest could arise. I duly resigned from all these positions. I wonder whether the new Cabinet Secretary has found occasion to enlighten the current External Affairs Minister about her obligations under the existing code of conduct for ministers and public servants.
But the real problem, of course, is implicit in the Home Minister's defiant stand that NDA Ministers don't resign. It's part of an overall pattern we have seen from this Government. They have taken no steps to appoint a Lokpal or ensure that the institutions created by the Lokpal Bill start functioning. They kept the post of Chief Central Vigilance Commissioner vacant for several months before finally filling it with an appointee who has yet to find any grounds for action in the conduct of the BJP's ministers. It's not a pretty picture.
The only hope is that the media exposure of wrongdoing will prompt public interest litigation that in turn might give us a Supreme Court directive on conflict of interest. But how sad it is that our democracy needs the judiciary to do what any honest government ought to be able to do for itself. 
Unfortunately, ours is a government that proclaims its own virtue from the rooftops, but declines to spell out the standards it holds its own leaders to. Perhaps because it doesn't have any. The BJP's answer to charges of conflict of interest appears simple enough: self-interest will always prevail over the national interest. Then where's the conflict?Note: This piece has been edited to remove a statement that incorrectly said the assets of NDA ministers are not listed publicly.(Dr Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mr Tharoor why are you so surprised over attitude of BJP? Our home minister said because he knew that our current PM was protected when Gujrat was burning. Then CM of Gujarat did not resign and now he is holding post of PM. How do you expect him to ask Mrs Swaraj or Ms Raje to resign? Though as far as I understand Mr Modi (PM) , he can go to any extent to keep his position safe. Lalit Modi has been projected by BJP as victim rather than guilty.  Has anybody asked Lalit Modi why underworld is after his life? How much money he robbed from underworld? It seems to me that Lalit Modi has got several secrets of BJP buried in his closet and seriously i think he should be scared more from BJP than underworld. BJP is after his blood and therefore Lalit Modi does not want to come back.

                            In AP:<br/>
It is not conflict of interest when YSR govt ceded govt lands, mines, contracts to his son causing lakhs of crores to exchequer.<br/>
It is not conflict of interest when YSR govt doled out contracts(irrigation, housing for poor, jalayagnam) to their men for quid pro quo.<br/>
It is not a conflict of interest if son-in-law gets govt land for dirt cheap and make crores.....<br/>
But, it is definitely conflict of interest as it is ethically wrong for Sushma, Raje to have helped Modi though no money is involved.<br/><br/>
It is all ok that for 4 years UPA did not pursue his extradition.

                            The final stage of attainment of a yogi Samadhi state , wherein he will be in communion only with the god. India's PM appears to have reached that state. He appears to hear and see no evil particularly if they happen to be is cabinet colleagues or party colleagues. For a virtual bachelor, his party members  seem to be his parivar, whose welfare appears to be paramount to him.

They will cling on to their coveted posts till they are sacked or forced by the people who wrongfully elected them.

                            If every time an allegation was made a minister had to resign, there would be no ministry left. Did the UPA ministers resign, in spite of so many scams? Raja was sacked after the courts intervened. So also Dayanidhi Maran. While telling stories tell about Balu and his son. Instead of expending hot air, Tharoor may point out specifically where the conflict of interest arises. Just because he was advised to resign from some committees due to perceived future conflict of interest does not mean a cabinet minister has to do so without any proof of wrongdoing. Tharoor writes well, but should refrain from writing nonsense.

                            Here is the classic case of pot calling kettle black. Tharoor has no moral ground to write about morality and conflict of interest. He himself is entangled in his wife.s murder case and it is the same Lalit Modi when found something fishy of Tharoor's role in the murder, had his passport revoked by Chidambaram. If conflict of interest were to be the ground for resignation, the entire cabinet of UPA would have had to resign which never happened. Today they are preaching BJP. Unlike congress ministers cases where millions of public money was looted, in the present case, there is no financial corruption. Nobody need to resign as it is not a serious case that warrants resignation. Let the media and congress continue shouting as it is fun watching them.

                            Mr. Tharoor forgot about Quatrochhi who was the master of Mr. Tharoor's present masters. He was given a respectful exit from the country while the congress top brass was holding his hand. The accounts which were frozen were quietly de-freezed by the congi govt. so that Mr. Quatrochhi can enjoy7 a "dignified and peaceful" life after retirement. And Mr,. Tharoor talks about probity practised by the congi govt.

                            Whatever be ones views on the Leela or the Congress party's approach and probity in public life what is unexceptionable in Tharoor's opinion is questioning the lack of acting in a proper fiduciary manner by the CM of Rajasthan and the Foreign Minister of India. Hopefully the stage of revulsion against the political system, currently at the stage of the carpet bagger, will in and a cleansing will commence. Hoover did it in the USA. The question is who will take the lead in India.

                            Mr Tharoor- You were not in politics in 1984; and yet I request you to do some research on behalf of your party and come out with an honest appraisal  on Warren Anderson's great escape from India.Compared to WA people like Lalit Modi are insignificant.To give an idea to the readers, I would like to add that Congress never satisfactorily answered how and why Warren Anderson (CEO, Cynide India) the main accused in Bhopal Gas tragedy was flown out of India in a special plane in 1984. Rajiv Gandhi was PM of India and Arjun Singh was perhaps the CM of MP. It will also do good if Congress reveals how son of a Nehru Gandhi family sycophant, who was convicted for murder with a 30 year prison term in US got US Presidential pardon (Ronald Reagan) and released in exchange for WA. It was a clear case quid pro quo. What a shameless exchange- thousands of Indian lives vs one US person's life.
