Headline::::Why Kandhamal Should Haunt Each of Us



DateTime::::2015-09-04T16:32:00+05:30




                                It is seven years since the worst carnage against the Christian community took place in Kandhamal in Odisha. I, along with some others, was there to attend the annual observance, this time in Raikia, of the anniversary organized by the Kandhamal Committee for Peace and Justice in the memory of those killed, injured in 2008 and for those whose lives have been forever marked by the trauma and terror of the communal conflagration that lasted for several months. 
 
The toll was heavy, with 80-100 Christians reportedly murdered, thousands of homes burnt, churches and educational institutions vandalized, over 56,000 people forced to flee their homes to live in the squalor of relief camps. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had named the RSS, the VHP and the Bajrang Dal as being responsible. But the victim survivors still wait for justice.
 
Have a quick look at this fact-sheet meticulously collected and provided by advocate-activist Dibya Singh Pariccha of Kandhamal: the victim survivors made 3,000 complaints to the police of which the police filed only 825 FIRs and, further minimizing the extent of the crimes, filed chargesheets in just 605 cases. 
 
Of these cases, nearly half have been closed due to "lack of evidence". This is a euphemism for witness intimidation which has marked the entire criminal justice process in these cases. Witnesses were terrorized into keeping quiet. A record 11,000 of the rioters were given anticipatory bail. Those criminals who had killed, burnt, and threatened were roaming around freely. Who would dare to speak? There have been convictions in just 73 cases involving lesser offences.
 
According to reports by inquiry teams, the number of murders were between 80-100. Many of the bodies were burnt. The Government registered only 35 deaths of the community attacked. Of these 35 murder cases, only two have ended in conviction, with a life sentence given to 10 persons. However, courts have released each one of these murder convicts on bail. 
 
Today there is only one man in jail for the rape of a nun. Even in this horrific case, the other two accused in the case were given bail and are now absconding. Space here is inadequate to detail other aspects of the monumental injustices but are available for anyone who cares to know.
 
Among the crowds in Raikia, there are seven women standing to one side. These are the wives of the men, four Adivasi and three Dalits, all Christian, who have been convicted of the murder of Lakshamananda Saraswati. He was the leader of the often violent and hate-filled anti-conversion campaign against the Christian community in this part of Odisha. His murder was the pretext for the carnage. Pretext because the Maoists had already declared proudly that it was they who had killed Lakshmananda and four of his followers, including a woman. Yet the Hindutva forces targeted the Christian community after his murder, and unleashed unprecedented violence against them.
The women have large families to manage from between four to six children each, except for the youngest who has two children. They work as agricultural workers during the season for Rs. 100 a day or eke out a living through the collection of minor forest produce, earning on an average a small sum of Rs. 50 or 60 a day. I tell them that I have met their husbands in jail that morning. They smile for a second and shake my hand. Their words are translated for me: How much longer before we can see the face of justice? The women have a dignity in their desperation. Much like their husbands, the men I had met that morning. 
They had walked into the room, six of them. It was the jailor's office in the Phulbani District Central jail in Kandhamal district of Odisha. There was not much time to talk. Just an expression of solidarity from us. An appeal for help from them. A few words. A few tears, quickly suppressed. They said that even the "babas" had sent them messages in jail saying that they knew they were not guilty. They stood straight when they spoke. I looked at the tallest of them. I recalled what I had read in that atrocious judgement holding them guilty. The police-tutored witness had said in response to a question - "I saw a tall, black man" .. a tall black man, a description which would fit every third Indian man, but it was enough to lock him and the others up on equally flimsy grounds for seven years for a crime they have not committed.
 
I was asked why I had gone to meet men convicted of murder. Would it not give a wrong message of approval? The answer is simple: I went because they are innocent. This is a case where the law has taken a terribly wrong course. You need just to read the appalling judgement of the lower court to believe as I do that these men are innocent. 
 
Quite recently, (June 25, 2015) one of the police officers who was part of the investigating team had testified before the Naidu Commission, set up to inquire into the reasons for the riots, that documents that have been used by the prosecution to put forward the concocted theory of a conspiracy by Christians to murder Lakshmananda are false. This was a register supposedly from the Betticola church which had been given to the police by a BJP leader Ashok Sahu and quoted in the judgement as proof of the conspiracy. A forensic report now available shows that the signatures on the register are forged. Yet neither the State Government nor the police have prosecuted Sahu for cheating the court, leave alone recognizing that it knocks the bottom out of the case of conspiracy. The officer also informed the Commission that his investigations of the charge that the Christian organisations were funding a conspiracy were found to be false. 
 
The entire case of a conspiracy is itself a conspiracy to defame the community and arrest innocent people. The appeal is currently before the High Court.
But why the double standards? Why give bail to the killers and arsonists and deny bail to those you know to be innocent?
 
These questions haunt you when you visit Kandhamal. The Kandhamal seven and their families need your help, your solidarity, in whatever way you can. Here are their names: Durjadhan Majhi, Goranath Chalan Seth, Buddhuadeb Nayak, Vijay Kumar Sunsat, Bhaskar Majhi, Sanatan Majhi, Munda Bara Majhi, remember them every time you think of Indian democracy.

                            The right wing extremist groups are causing harm not only to the minorities but also defaming the majority. It is high time people start realizing that extremism has always resulted in tragedies in history and always will. People should stop supporting the extremist groups and disassociate with them. Everyone has the right to spread their religion and everyone has the right to choose their faith, whether it is conversion or reconversion or re-re-conversion. Violence should not come into picture here. But the right wing extremists hardly understand this and continue to spread hatred and violence. So it's for the people to choose whom they want to support.

                            Hindutva forces have long been the enemy of humanity in India. Before independence, they subjugated the poor through their caste system. After independence, they unleash atrocities on hapless minorities in cohorts with the police and a pliable judiciary.

                            The worst culprits for persecution of minorities in the world are the communist regimes the world over (China, Russia, PolPot, eastern Europe). Even in India, the violence perpetrated by left wing organizations (Maoists, naxalites) is far greater than the violence by right wing organizations. I request Brinda Karat to look inwards before pronouncing such judgments.

                            Why this lady has been given space to write such bizarre piece. She is blatantly justifying killing of Lakshamananda Saraswati. The violence for any reason is bad, but one cannot overlook the fact that maoists back christian missionaries and the other way round. This makes both anti-national.

                            Wow...incredible article.<br/><br/>
This is what the article does well..<br/>
1. Carefully choose a starting point for history like..let's start with killing of Christians shall we; of course the loads of money pumped by world vision to convert unsuspecting tribals is not worth a mention..<br/><br/>
2. Laksmananda was a leader of violent right group...hmm. Well, it's convenient because the adivasis will never be able to read your blog and call your bluff and say what a noble soul he was. Smart work..<br/><br/>
3. Hindu bashing. Well, this was expected anyway. Gives you the votes right...che..ching..<br/><br/>
Brindavan, I have one request..please don't wear that big bindi. As is, your ppl have confused the identity of a Hindu and made them feel embarrassed and guilty about their religion due to posts like this....<br/><br/>
When you cannot present a balanced view of both sides, we know which side you are on..<br/><br/>
So, please...don't insult the bindi...

                            Brinda should first practice what she preaches. The CPM governments in both West Bengal and Kerala were booted out for the violence unleashed by the cadre against both rivals and rebels of the party in those states. This provoked a deadly backlash where thousands of CPM cadre were killed in both states by their political opponents. Even now in Kannur district of Kerala CPM cadres are being killed by their rivals for their violent attacks against them. Trinamool Congress members killed many CPM members who had been killing them when the CPM was in power and against whom the state government and police took no action. Internationally, communist regimes in Russia, China, Vietnam, Cambodia and Cuba were responsible for the massacres of millions of citizens of those countries. And now this stupid woman talks saintly nonsense about the Kandhamal violence which was a minor local dispute. All legal disputes take a long time to settle in India, and the same is the case here. Even stupidity has a limit, and I am really surprised that such arrant nonsense is aired at all.

                            The communal carnage must be dealt severely but Ms Karat is conspicuously silent about the trigger that started it . you cannot be selective in such cases and succeed in fighting it.Murder of a Hindu saint on Janmastami in his Ashram , who ever may be the perpetrators also must be condemned in same space.

It has become trendy to blame RSS, Bajrang Dal for all the evils that happen in India and blame NRI Hindus for all the bad that happens abroad !!! The most communal and criminal communists who are responsible for murders of thousands in Kerala, WASTE Bengal and other parts of India and world wide.They come to power in name of Democracy and then become ruthless dictators !!!

Comment::::<div class="com_user_text">
                            Let me describe the true picture of Kandhamal violence, Ms. Brinda Karat.<br/><br/>
Kandhamal is a tribal major district present in the centre of Odisha. Christian missionaries have been converting the poor tribal people for the last 50 years or more. A majority of the converted people are from a harijan caste known as 'pana' who were the subordinates of the original tribal people known as 'Kandha' before independence. Generally the tribal people do not like to come out of the forest anywhere in the world. So before independence the 'Pana' people were acting as the mediators between the 'Kandhas' and the outside world and obviously were cleverer than the tribals.<br/><br/>
After independence the socio-economic conditions took a paradigm shift and Kandha people started mixing with outside people. Gradually the Kandha-Pana relation started to change and when the Kandhas gradually came to know that they are being cheated by panas their relation came through bad times. For the last 30 years it was worse and the two communities came face to face many times (1993 violence was a prominent one)for many reasons especially regarding forest resources.<br/><br/>
Now come to conversion activities. The missionaries play many fowl tricks to fool the uneducated people. They tell many bad things about the Hindu gods. For example, when somebody suffers from Malaria (which is the prime factor for deaths in Kandhamal till date) his family people will generally start doing some puja and take some herbal medicine. There the missionary people will go and give some malaria medicine and will tell that was Jesus's Prasad. So the poor fellow gets fooled and  converted to Christianity. Once converted they try to showcase themselves as better Christians. They start eating beef. The interesting fact is that the converted ‘panas' don't register these conversions officially because that will take away their reservation facility. So they go to church but are Hindu on record.<br/><br/>
Now tribals worship cow and these converted people kills them. Here comes the conflict between the Kandhas and converted Christians. So there was always a simmering tension between the two communities. Lakshmanananda Saraswati's killing only inflamed that suppressed anger to such greater magnitude.<br/><br/>
Kandhamal riot was a very unfortunate incident and teaches us a lot of lessons. People must stop being pseudo-secularist. If conversions are allowed it should be allowed for all (from Hindu to Other as well as other to Hindu) else it must be stopped for all. So called secularist must not shout when someone gets converted to Hinduism.
                         </div>

1. The first mistake, Swami Laxmanananda was attacked repeatedly &amp; finally killed. You are not talking about that.It was the first mistake by a group of people.<br/>
2. I agree, christians were attacked including my friends.<br/>
3. Do you know, some innocent people were framed &amp; jailed. They were non christians, including my friends. They fled the home like christians.They have not gone back agaon to their place.<br/><br/>
In spite of all these, still we as friends both christians &amp; Hindus sit together &amp; are having food together.<br/><br/>
Brinda Karat, talk the fact, appreciate the good things, be equal for both Hindu &amp; Christians.

                            Why we should ignore this article - 1. Because the so called communists in India are the most anti national element in India. A few instance we should remember from history - they were openly against freedom struggle of India, they called Netaji Tojo's dog, they called China's chairman their chairman after 1962 war and the list goes on and on. 2. They are also the most hypocritical party amongst all other hypocritical parties of India. In the name of fighting for the poor they ensure that the poor remains poor and the other also become poor - by destroying the industrial base of the country. 3. They are also the most communal though in our country they are termed "secular" - if appeasing the minorities for their votes at the cost of nation is secular then this country has no future. They let millions of illegal Bangladeshi muslims enter India over 30 years which destroyed the economy of WB as well changed the demography. WB is the biggest source of terrorist activities (support and logistics) now - far exceeding any other state.

The dastardly shooting of an 80 year old Swami; Swami Lakshmanananda Saraswati with assault rifles for the 'grave' sin of building schools and doing seva among the villagers. But, isn't this to be expected from Communists?

                            We don't need lectures by representatives of defunct ideologies like communism. It may be in karat's interest to keep kandhamal alive, but she will completely forget the role of missionaries. And for Hindu haters, unfortunately for you indian culture will always remain Hindu. No amount of spitting venom on Hindus is going to change that.<br/><br/>
The RSS And VHP are still strong in india as they are seen as the effective antidote to missionary fanaticism and Islamic fundamentalism. Whether the British fanned it or someone else, the fact remains that Congress cleverly played to vote bank politics and made Hindus feel inferior. Now Newton's third law is in force, that there is an opposite reaction from the Hindus.<br/><br/>
I am no BJP fan but The more I see such articles, the more I feel that BJP will come to power next time as well.

                            Brinda - point taken ... when will all the hooliganism of Communists over so many decades and the destruction of the livelihood of Bengalis haunt you ?

                            Brinda - was Swami Laxamanananda killed on Janmashtami day in front of his students and his body mutilated by the Hindus to give a pretext for the riots?<br/><br/>
Were the Hindu victims of murder and arson an invention of the Hindus to give a bad name to the oh-so-innocent christians?<br/><br/>
Shame on your biased and communal reporting of the riots!

                            Brinda Karat says, therefore, it must be so. The word of a leftist is more important than the word of the court of the law. Brinda says, so the murderers of Lakshmananda are innocent. Brinda, being the all knowing, all important leftist that she is, has only to pronounce something wrong or right and it automatically becomes so. So it has been, so it will be. Jai mate brinda.<br/><br/>
Of course, who gives a damn about the dead Swamy or the tribals. They are not christian and therefore not of any consequence. Brinda's tears are reserved solely for the non hindus, and her anguish for justice, for non hindus only. Mata brinda seems to partial to non hindus, it seems.<br/><br/>
The Irony is that this is a shameless display of self serving hypocrisy and politics, yet Brinda Mata cannot see it. It is not a bad thing, because well, nobody will mourn the death of Indian Left.<br/><br/>
Goodbye, Rajmata Brinda.

                            I am from Orissa and understand the tragedy much better.<br/>
The Religious leaders of all faiths and the politicking politicians on this issue had and have been responsible for this,<br/>
I am afraid the author has no moral authority on this.<br/>
She being the politician she is with her religious or not so religious views is part of the problem, precisely because mobilizing people and playing with emotions.

Your friends (Communist parties) around the world have committed heinous crimes against all kinds of religions!<br/><br/>
China on Budhists, North Korea on Christians..<br/><br/>
And we all know what you think of religion!

                            Actually speaking after living in WB I think the 35 years of CPM rule continues to haunt us - everything that we cherished - education, culture, industry were destroyed by these anti-national party.

                            Ms.Karat, which works are you living in? If you don't know by now that the Indian justice system is extremely selective, incompetent and that it crushes the weak and props up the strong, then there is no help for you. Even the nature of the commentators is such that injustice is not examined on its own merits. No, we must ask first, who is bringing it up, what is his or her religion, what party he or she belongs to, etc.

                            @Guest4321: How can you be so insensitive to the broader message being conveyed through this great work done by Ms.Brinda Karat. Ohh..probably because you were born in a well to do family, Had parents taking care of you in each &amp; every step of your life, Went to best of the Schools in town to get so called education, Never struggled in life to have three meals a day (Leave alone 1 meal a day), Lived in a colony or town where you were never under any fear of being ridiculed by somebody &amp; probably because you never felt the necessity of being concerned about somebody who is struggling every day to live. Put yourself in their shoes as probably a parent of one of those kids/as a wife or husband of one of those poor people &amp; just visualize (Don't live) &amp; than you would realize how horrible it is to live like them. EVEN IF YOU DON'T CARE IT DOES NOT MATTER BUT DO NOT TRY TO INFLUENCE PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS WITH YOUR LOUSY &amp; INSENSITIVE COMMENTS.
