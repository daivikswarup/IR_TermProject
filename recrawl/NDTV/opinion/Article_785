Headline::::Too Low? The News Peter, Indrani Mukerjea Sought



DateTime::::2015-09-01T13:28:00+05:30




                                Given the graph even the oomphiest of crime stories follows, chances are that the Sheena Bora-Indrani Mukerjea story is now in its fade-out phase. If you look at that ultimate, if sad, determinant of news value these days, it is already declining, if not disappearing, from the trending charts. Soon something else will take its place. We will suddenly remember again that there is firing on the LoC, the armed forces' veterans fight for OROP still continues and one "casualty" after another keeps reaching the hospital as fasting former soldiers collapse, and finally there will be the election campaign for Bihar. But fade as it might, this story will not disappear, maybe not even for decades, given how long legal processes take in our country.
 
The next stage will be the inevitable mega press conference some time soon by Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria, as he claims the police have put the story together. Then the case will be committed to court, trial, and who knows, shortly after the court verdict, there will another book saying what was wrong with it and how the judge "erred" following the trend successfully set now by Avirook Sen's Aarushi.
The points to debate now, therefore, are not so much in the domain of the crime in all its gory, greed, passion, shame, fame and fear-laden detail. These are points that concern us as a society, a democracy, the way our financial wizards function and the state of our news media.
 
Let's start backwards on these points, with the situation in our news media. We have all been complaining about trivialisation on our TV channels. Here too, Hindi and other Indian language channels are maligned more. In the coverage of the Sheena-Indrani episode, two TV "Breaking News" headlines have stood out and gone viral on social media as an example of the rot.
 
The first said "Indrani Mukerjea ne sandwich khaya" (Indrani Mukerjea ate a sandwich in police detention), and the other showed a morphed picture of a smiling Indrani behind bars with the "Breaking News" headline "pinjre mein pari" (the fairy in a cage). Both were used to highlight the terminal trivialisation of our news media. It surely made the tragedy of a family, however complex and mixed-up, look like a joke and the subject of family entertainment.
But I am not sure the Mukerjeas can complain too much about it. And this is why I say so.
 
Much before Indrani came into the picture, Peter Mukerjea had decided to launch the Star TV news channel in Hindi. This was in the wake of Star's break-up with its news content partner NDTV, which had now decided to go on its own. (Disclosure: I have had a professional relationship with NDTV for nearly 15 years now.) He appointed Ravina Raj Kohli as the Hindi news channel's CEO, and they both met me to ask if I would also be willing to do at least a show, if not more, with them.
 
They wanted to collect a "star-cast" of serious, senior Indian editors, all from the English world but to appear on their Hindi channel. On offer to me, to begin with, was an interview-based show  called "Shekhar ke Shikar". Sure enough, the other two English editors on their radar, M.J. Akbar and Vir Sanghvi, were offered shows called, predictably and respectively, "Akbar ka Durbar" and "Vir ke Tir".
But that sounds so trivial, I said, what is the point of having us boring old editors and making us do shows that sound like entertainment?
It is just branding, I was told, you have to trivialise to attract attention. Grow younger, Shekhar dear, I was advised. I was also told that headlines, brands, a little twist to bait the viewer here and there was not trivialisation, but necessary.
"Isi liye toh tera akhbar nahin bikta," Ravina chided me. "You start working with us, and we will also help you put some sex in it, phir dekh tu."
 
The fact is that is the kind of attitude they took to their channel, I was a victim collaterally - though while I did not agree to do that show (sometimes you take decent decisions), Star News lured away a whole bunch of very good young people from my staff. Soon enough, the channel collapsed, and they all were left in the lurch. Maybe India was not yet ready for that kind of trivialisation too.
But more importantly, the channel was ultimately bought by Aveek Sarkar, and is now called ABP News. It is extremely successful too.
 
In one of those ironies, that "pinjre mein pari" Breaking News headline ran last week on ABP News, which was Peter and his team's own baby to begin with.
 
The next is the state of the financial world and regulatory environment. Many of the key founders of the fund that made the largest investment in the Mukerjeas' venture, New Silk Route, landed in jail for stock markets fraud in America. These include Rajat Gupta and Rajaratnam. Anil Kumar got probation, and at least two others remained under the scanner. So before you say the Mukerjeas ripped off their investors, ask what were these financial whizkids doing?
 
Murdoch's Star then merrily played with Indian regulation and with restrictions on foreign ownership of news media, setting up dummy holding structures and benami intermediates. Any investigation into the financial aspect of the Indrani story has to begin there. You will have enough prominent Page-3 people under the scanner to bring the story back in the headlines.
 
And finally, what does it say for our society? That we enjoy watching muck on our TV, but then love to snigger at it as muck and make fun of journalists who bring it to us. And we take the idea of "honour killings" so much in our stride. Because it is something "poor, uncultured, villagers, ganwars" do to their children. But people like us? No, no. That is why, Aarushi's parents could never have killed their child, no matter what the court says. Only Haryana and Western UP Jats kill their daughters for "honour". And if Indrani did that, she probably did so because she was a glamorous, greedy, power-hungry, small-town girl with ambitions way beyond her station.
 
We need to understand that in that weakest of all moments, when a human being commits a horrible crime, every human being is the same: fearful, greedy, vulnerable, stupid, classless, casteless and guilty. There are no mitigating factors.(Shekhar Gupta hosts 'Walk the Talk' and 'Chalte Chalte' on NDTV.

                            Good points, Shekhar. But I find this is no different than what NDTV did with Lalitgate. Senior anchors were debating whether Raje signed the document and getting handwriting expert opinions, while Raje hadn't said a word at all. The amount of attention news channels gave it probably encouraged the Congress to halt Parliament - they thought there was meat there. So why has Lalitgate disappeared from the news? Because at the end of the day, there was no financial corruption. There is no one to prosecute. No money to follow. No court cases. Lalitgate should have been in the news, but not with the tamasha newswallahs created. It was a traffic ticket, not a criminal case.

                            Thank you for taking up this issue. Unfortunately Tabloid is taking over real Journalism in this country. The other day I switched over from these private news channels  to RSTV (Rajya Shabha TV) to save myself from Indrani saga. And I found quality of program quite nice there. A healthy discussion was there on the 50th anniversary of 1965 war and quite enriching to hear Mr. Kuldeep Nayyar. I really had a pleasant and peaceful evening. Time to ignore prime time of these private news channels.

                            Once a student prepares for an essay on a cow, but the exam asks for an essay on a tree. After thinking for a while, the student writes the essay prepared for: on the cow. And in last sentence connects it to the tree with a sentence that "normally cows are tethered to trees".<br/><br/>
Sekhar Gupta has nicely connected his autobiography to Indrani Mukerjea. It's well timed too, as the actual story is mostly being phased out.

Donald Trump was asked on a CNN recently that he is a misogynist and had used certain adjectives to respond to a woman who moderated one of the republican debates. To that he said that he didn't mean what he said because he has studied from Wharton and cannot possibly mean that, even though he said it on National TV..<br/><br/>
Just because you're from Wharton doesn't necessarily makes you classy....in his "weakest of moments" he turned out to be dumb, classless and fearful that the truth is about to be uncovered...<br/><br/>
Excellent piece!

                            Very good analysis of media functioning both in front of screen and behind the screen.  No news channel reports events as they happen but they add masala as per their own interest and interpret the events. Ultimately many people have lost faith in the news broadcast by many channels.

                            Funny part is that all the journalists (including Mr.Gupta whom I respect a lot for being a sane voice in these crazy times) always comment post facto i.e. why don't they share all these facts beforehand...Why once somebody has committed a crime do all the journo vultures sit around the corpse and comment " Yeh to tha hee aisa". Mr.Gupta hope you are read this comment.

                            the standard of Indian media is sub-standard like many other things. Sometimes it is immature and sometume it is hype. the media doesn't create developmental civerages on healthcare, education, roads , lives of rural India. It is for a bunch of creatures sitting around Delhi and enjoying on tax payers' money either directly or indirectly. Have you seen the quality of BBC, CNN or AL ZAZEERA? You can copy English language but can't copy the btain or content.

There are more than 15 movies made for Dawood and 2 on Aarushi or maybe more and this story is a free flowing script for the script hungry Bollywood. I can already visualize Bipasha playing the role of Indrani with Imran Hashmi as Rahul , Rajat kapoor as Peter and any hot chic playing Sheena..... Ram Gopal Verma must be camping at the murder site now and Mahesh bhatt glued to these news channels.

                            Guptaji... interesting article. But, just like any other mediaman, you have also not stopped to make the public and the society to look responsible for this new-low in the media world. Do you think anyone in the public would have been so interested, if the media had just made a small remark about this , as a news item and left it at that? Would the media have taken so much interest if Indrani was a housemaid and her husband Peter was a truck driver in a remote village? So, please accept ... IT IS THE MEDIA WHO STARTS IT... and then tries to pass things on as ... THE PUBLIC WANTS IT.. SO WE GIVE IT. <br/>
The , you mention about some Page 3 people who could be involved in the financial mess. Why dont you go to the police and take these names? Help the nation!<br/>
But, thanks for writing an article which clearly goes to show that media is not at all holier than thou. And, they necessarily need a regulator, just like any other face of this democracy. Raise your word FOR it, we will support you.

                            Shekharji your contents are fine nothing wrong but there is other side of the story which doesn't reflected in this article. This is unique case where all facets of human relations and social norms are seems have new dimensions which is unprecedented. First thing is Family background of Ms. Pari Bora alies Indrayani Mukharji itself fake name. Second Parents identity is dubious within area where they lived neighbours are also unable to reveal their social status. Thirds Number of marriages then reveals truth about children's are borne without marriage. Further migrations to metro cities like Kolkatta then Mumbai managing marriages with wealthiest people in town without disclosing identities and antecedents Kolkatta Husband don't know Sheena to whom they killed are daughter from her previous relationship. then UK borne CEO of Indians top Media Company surrender to honey trap become ignorant of her past and present and share massive wealth generated out of his tricks. Further husbands son falling in her daughter love manage to get engagements. Husband son has only interest in his agenda of marriage. Victim also has another agenda all characters have different agendas. These relationship challenges common-sense of people and brain.  <br/>
But finally one must ask simple question that what is educational qualification of Pari Bora alias Indrayani Mukharja which can generate such massive wealth?

                            Shekhar, you seem to be obsessed with Aarushi's case. Why dont you please read the judgement and quality of testimony given by prosecution witness and then comment on Talwars guilt. The judge in the verdicts defines maid bharti mandal as " "Bharti Mandal is totally illiterate and bucolic lady from a lower-strata of the society and hails from Malda District of West Bengal who came to Noida to perform menial jobs to sustain herself and family and therefore, if she has stated that she has given her statement on the basis of tutoring, her evidence cannot be discarded or rejected." So now who is playing the class card? isnt all people urban/rural same?<br/><br/>
The problem i find is that media people think that they are too intelligent, elite and just dump their analysis on common public. No we are not dumb. We may read your news papers, watch tv channels but we have a mind of our own, and scrutinize the details.<br/><br/>
Personally i had high opinion about your work. I had considered Shekhar Gupta to be a responsible, senior media person. But somehow your naive stands on Aarushi book makes me feel you are one among the crowd, no different from others. I hope that you atleast read the judgement and quality of prosecution witness before you comment on this case.

                            Yes Dear Shekhar Your are right ! Of course in the context of indian patrakarita ! Kaun kisko kya aur kyu parosh rha he ye hamesha parde ke piche he rehta h ! Roj TV par samajwadi vichoro ke tadke ke sath pesh karne wale anchors lakho me paid he kise malum chalta he... hum to sirf ekh ke h behak jate h.. mujhe baso pehle  dekha hua ek khane par programme yad aa rha h.. use hamare bade nami patrakar jo aap ke sath vi (sekhar) kam kiye h, chalate the .. ab  des bhar me ghumte ghumte wo pahuch gye gujrat ab kya tha unka DNA jor mara aur khane ko to bhul gye aur chalu ho sampradiykta par.. bada maja aya unhe sun kar .. basically shekhar hum sav hypocrate he by nature... ab pata nhi meri y tippani NDTV wale chapenge ya nhi pata nahi ... bhai mat chapna magar shekhar tak jarur pahucha dena .. wo jara hat ke patrakarita karte h so sayad wo samajhe unki patahko ki baat...

                            Shekhar - Why don't the govt. and news channels come under some regulation that say 60% of the news should only be to assess govt. functioning in each constituency and how development is taking place - we need transparency in govt. - like we have budgets vs actuals in corporate world - this indrani stuff is complete nonsense - let police handle crimes

                            Awesome post.... Describes the current scenario very well even though we all are really a part of it inspite of being mute spectators at times.

                            I totally agrees with shekhar jee, what all news channel is showing 24*7 from last one week...........some times it seems like they are mentally bankrupt......so called brilliant journalist wasting their brillinat minds to analysis nonsense and demeaning murder story...............<br/><br/>
Mr. Manoahar Parikh (defense minister) is very right to criticize the media as It was a pathetic not a single news channel had given importance to 50th year of indian army victory celebration held at delhi.......<br/><br/>
for god sake...wake up indian news channel......India had many other issues Reservation, agriculture,economy, land reform, orop, female education etc.........
