Headline::::St Stephen's and Its Principal Are Not Finished



DateTime::::2015-05-12T15:50:00+05:30




                                A few have been busy writing obituaries on St. Stephen's College. Ram Guha started it all with a catchy title, Murder in the Cathedral? Though attired only in the innerwear of a traditional Oracle, he predicted, back in 2007, the imminent demise of St. Stephen's and issued a demented call to organize a tearful burial. I saw the same Guha the other day on the NDTV programme anchored by Sonia Singh, my former student. He sounded angry: angry that St. Stephen's had the temerity to fly in the face of his Doomsday prophecy. Sheer impertinence, sure, on the part of the College not to have obliged. I was reminded of an episode that I heard, half a century ago, in my village. The doctor certified a patient to be dead. While being taken to the ghat for cremation, the 'deceased' stirred slightly, then coughed once or twice and produced further un-obliging signs of being alive. Those who were carrying him became indignant. "The doctor says you are dead; how dare you behave otherwise?"
Sorry, Ram. No matter how loud you rave and rant, St. Stephen's will not oblige you. It is not free to, for the love of the youth of this country.
Well, I am grateful that Swapan Dasgupta, whose son graduated from the College only recently, acknowledged that the College is "a cherished rarity". A million young men and women from around the country would agree with him, even if this leaves Ram Guha gnashing his teeth like in the seventh circle of Dante's Hell.
Let me put simple facts against Ram Guha's co(s)mic charges against the College.
1. The plural character of the College is in shambles. Truth to tell, the plural character of the College had attenuated by the time I became Principal. The student body looked, barring a few instances, almost homogenized. That was not a problem for Guha, because this homogenization favoured the social elite. (I don't expect him to appreciate that 'elitism' is de facto 'anti-plural'. Or, elitism is a homogenizing principle.) It was precisely to revive the plural culture of the College - to include the excluded - that I brought in reservations, not only for Christians, but also for the SCs and STs. It was for this offence that Ram Guha damned the College to hell. You have to be a Ram Guha to afford the right to bash up an institution for taking steps to preserve pluralism and also, in the same breath, to damn the institution for killing pluralism. But, mark this - he is not as self-contradictory as he appears, prima facie. He is for pluralism. But his pluralism must be accommodated strictly within the confines of social elitism. Sorry, Ram, that is not the vision of St. Stephen's College. It should never be.
2. "Christianisation" has ruined the College. Why should Christians, who are 2% of the population, Ram thunders, occupy upto 50% of the seats in St. Stephen's? The answer to this silly argument was given eight years ago by Kabir Bedi, a fellow Stephanian. Of course, Ram would not listen to him. He must be heard, but don't expect him to listen. Kabir said, quite rightly, that Ram's argument could make sense only if 2% of seats in all educational institutions are reserved for Christians, which will never be the case. To insist that admission of Christian applicants to a Christian institution should be limited only to 2% , proportionate to their demographic size, is a fallacy that only Ram Guha can flaunt in public without attracting ridicule.
3. St. Stephen's, Guha laments next, has become irrelevant. There are better institutions - Ramjas, LSR, SRCC, NLS. Here he loses his track completely. According to him, the National Law School is producing better "social scientists" and geniuses of humanities than St. Stephen's. Till I heard Guha, I thought NLS taught Law. I now stand corrected. Ram, please come and ask the current students of St. Stephen's as to how many of them would want to migrate to Ramjas, LSR and SRCC. Then repeat the exercise in the reverse. You will be lucky, if you are left smiling at the end of it.
4. Now, it gets almost bizarre with Guha. According to him, the only department in St. Stephen's College that is worth anything at all is the Department of Philosophy. Being a historian, Guha does not know that the cut-off for Philosophy is lower than that of all other departments, except Sanskrit. It is lower than that of the BA Programme. And that too, when we take only 10 students per year. This is the only course for which 10 students per seat are shortlisted for interviews; for fear that otherwise we may not get the required 10 of some merit! This, incidentally, is an old problem. Well, I feel embarrassed to have to embarrass Guha. But I need to tell him that this is the problem when you bury an institution prematurely and out of prejudice. You stop doing any research. You get completely out of touch with facts. And you pontificate, generating heat, not light.
 
5. Now a quick word about my excellent friend Mani Shankar Aiyar. He has a Mani-esque thesis: Principals don't matter. Students carry 90% of the burden of merit, teachers 4-8%. The remaining 2% - he does not mention this - is carried, I supposed, by karmacharis or Rohtas. Well, I have taught for over three decades. Mani does not seem to have the faintest idea of how unprepared students are at the entry level, given the school education they come from. All through my time as a teacher in St. Stephen's, I had to help my students build their foundations, brick by brick. Mani may have been a genius, but not many are. Mani is an instinctive myth-maker, an invigorating story-teller. He means no harm. But he loves to cook up and dish out. Here we have a typical Maniproprism (on the analogy of Malapropism). Given a chance, he will surely tell you that the PM is also irrelevant, the babus are 90% of the Government, and the MPs 4-8 per cent. Don't take him too seriously. If he offers a cup of chai, accept it and listen to him for as long as the chai lasts. The moment you suspect he sees a Maken in the chai cup, spring up and run for dear life!
6. Now, this one is not to be missed at all. This is Swapan at his very best. He knows Mani has gone quite over the top. But, in the typical Stephanian fashion, he doesn't goad Mani. Instead, he slips in a banana peel, so to speak. "Why should a student magazine interview the Principal?" he asks with smirking innocence. Mani bites the bait. He raises his right hand in ready approval. Swapan smirks, knowing that he has got Mani this time around. Why would the students want to interview the Principal? Well, the answer is that the Principal matters! Matters a great deal. By the way, Mani, "the interview" runs into some 2,000 words. All because the Principal doesn't matter, no?
7. Further contradictions follow. Swapan laments the decline of values all over the country. One of his fellow panelists snorts - "Discipline, be damned". If a student betrays the trust reposed in him, he should not be disciplined, but rewarded. What better can we do to make values thrive? It is well and truly said that India is being built in her class rooms.
8. One last thing. Why can't issues be sorted out, a panelist wonders, within the four walls of the College, as it used to be in the past? Well, well.... Those days are gone, my dear fella. Media 24x7, the Internet, social media.... the accoutrements of the brave new world... with an assortment of new-fangled stuff, from smart phones to road rage... where the right to question is cut adrift from the duty to be answerable... and the right to think is devoid of the duty to make sense.
At the end of the day, if anyone were to ask you, "Friend, where are you headed?", you could answer, like the German philosopher, "I wish I knew...."
Keep watching... St. Stephen's being buried alive again and again, while in robust health, by those who learned to dig, thanks to the College.(Valson Thampu is the Principal of St Stephen's College, University of Delhi.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            If you were to take the 'signalling' value of St. Stephen's away— the signal that a student is bright if he/she went to  St. Stephen's— there'd be very little left.<br/><br/>
Add to this the fact that college now not only has an intolerant Principal, but also a tacky one, who found it necessary to write an article about how important he is and, therefore, how it makes complete sense for students to interview him! Of course, he would respond by saying it's the institution of the Principal and not himself that he was talking about...<br/><br/>
At least as far as the Principal goes, Mani Shankar Aiyar, for once, seems to be right.

                            If a group of people who represent 2% of the population are given 50% of reservations in a college, the resulting mix of students is anything but  representative of the society outside. And to claim that this group represents the "bright" minds of India is a sick joke. It is time for the other university colleges and to BAN admission to Christians for one year and send them a message. I am disgusted with the condescending attitude of this guy. Time to break this nexus of religion/education and send all these missionaries to where they belong. If you want to stay in India respect the demography of the land. Education, healthcare, law and order should be same for all.

                            St Stephens is a christian mafia (white-mafia) college just like the Christian Medical College in Vellore is. There education may be ok but their politics will make Jesus hide his face with a cloth

                            College was a fantastic place to be in no matter that left leaning students like Swapan and Chandan Mitra turned hard right. Accepted the appointment as the President of the students union (society) the year of the emergency. We had teachers like R.K. Dasgupta to offset others like the current principal who will do whatever possible to harm the institution. Top quality teachers leave the college thanks to that same very Principal. Bash on VT. you are doing a fantastic job.

                            If i knew he was the principal and the college was what it is now, I would have never joined St. Stephen's Myself. Its sick to have a principal so full of only himself. If there is a doom to the college, it will only be you. The college which is always marred with such nonsense all the time leaves such a bad taste in the mouth for anyone. If you want to gloat about the college, gloat about its current victories if there are any, current faculty, if there are any left, not the past which you had no part in besides being an irrelevant  teacher for 10% of the college goers, be glad you had a great principal and great teachers around you when you were a teacher at St. stephen's.. Sadly neither the recent alumni nor the current students can gloat of that anymore. All they can do is be involved in controversies and your nonsense.

                            Dear Rev Thames St. Stephens is a great place no doubt. The one thing that jarred during my studies there though was the Christian quota. Meddle with meritocracy and the atmosphere of the college goes for a toss. Once the atmosphere which nurtured us is gone, the College will be gone. I support you in everything else but this is unacceptable and time shall tell the folly of your actions!

                            "Christianisation" has ruined the College - It has ruined many colleges. I went back to my college a few years back and the xtian professors were complaining that due to this reason (ie xtianisation) the quality of students/education have gone done like anything. Also, these guys try to communalize the media. Just check the reporters of certain leading news papers...you will know what I am talking about.<br/><br/>
@adhikarala - Science education minus the religious stuff is the best way to go. We can take some of good ideas from Vedic and Missionary education systems....but we don't want any religious stuff in the schools. that is the job of a parent.

                            Wow.. So 50% reservation is justified because there are other institutions who don't provide reservations. So does he imply that Christians despite being 2% of the population need reservations everywhere and can't survive without that. And hence he has taken it upon himself to make up the average... Hilarious

                            This is really funny; this prinicipal is one of the most infamous principals of St. Stephens who has dragged a reputed college into controversey by abusing his power of position to stifle freedom of speech. He now uses the same freedom of speech avenue to rave and rant about himself and the college under his supervision. Mr. Thampu, time to go back to the basics and introspect your actions; to sin and not repent is not acceptable. Atleast acknowledge your mistakes and make ammends.

                            I'm yet to meet an alumnus of any great institution who goes back after a generation or few and says the college / school has improved after s/he passed out (other than relating to technologies/facilities). It's always a 'those were the days' lament, which is quite understandable, since we tend to view sepia tinged photos with rose tinted glasses. Hence, while a lament is par for the course, the rant is unfair. Even as all these yester-year worthies opine from their own corners, no one can deny that the best of the best vie to get into the college even today and go on to do very well indeed once they pass out, thanks at least in part to what they gain within its campus. What's more, even subsequent generations of the critics are/were cut from the same cloth. Hence it would seem the institution is doing very well thank you. <br/><br/>
As for the need for a principal to issue a rejoinder, in the normal course I would agree that this should not be required. But here again, is it normal when a specific institution and individual is savagely pilloried even on the most silly of issues so frequently? There seems to be a column cm "reservation" in the two main dailies of Delhi for negative news on the college. As for silliness, the last one was about a circular asking students "not to feed stray dogs on campus and guide the blind students away from them since there had been instances of dog bites". And this made it to a newspaper as an instance of the college being investigated for cruelty to animals??? Surely it is bias when 'dog bites man' makes it to page 5! I am an avid and voracious consumer of news and in my view I see a definite pattern. I am certain there are people with strong media connections who are using their positions to attack the institution and the individual. Given this background, it seems putting out a counter-view directly is the only option and frankly, I would say it is one of the duties of any principal to defend the reputation of his institution in public. At least we get to hear the 'other' side and are better informed to form our own view.
