Headline::::Rahul Gandhi's Guerrilla Attacks on PM Modi



DateTime::::2015-07-19T13:53:00+05:30




                                Rahul Gandhi renewed his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government the other day in Jaipur, with a reference to corruption allegations against BJP functionaries and even an eye-popping analogy with the film Lagaan. A pattern seems to be appearing to the Congress Vice-President's political actions after his 56-day break earlier this year. He makes shorts bursts of interventions that are loud and aggressive and aimed at capturing media space. These are interrupted by long lulls, when the day-to-day assault is carried out by his party colleagues.
There is nothing right or wrong with this approach; it is simply the path Rahul and the Congress have chosen. Perhaps the party recognises that its would-be President doesn't quite have the stamina to sustain a long-drawn engagement and will only make what one Congress functionary called "guerrilla" appearances. What is remarkable is that Rahul's essential argument continues to be exactly what it was before May 16, 2014: he is the voice of the poor and the underprivileged, the peasant and the underdog; Modi is the representative of the rich. That neat binary has not been disturbed, even if it didn't quite work in the previous Lok Sabha election.
It is possible Rahul believes a Modi in power for five years - as opposed to a Modi who was an outsider to Delhi and the product of a compelling personal narrative built around his humble family origins - will be easier to paint as pro-rich. This can conceivably be attempted at the end of Modi's term. Whether it will work and what purpose it will serve at the beginning of Modi's second year - when, whatever the other misgivings about his government, the Prime Minister's personal integrity and honesty of purpose are broadly intact - is difficult to answer. It that sense, Rahul may be raising his pitch a bit too early.
Second, is this ultra-left positioning natural to the Congress - or should Rahul be nudged towards regaining the classic centrism of the Congress? Will regional parties - including the Aam Aadmi Party - not obviously out-left the Congress on this count?
There are different views in the party. For instance, there are those who facilitated the passage of the Insurance Bill in the previous session of Parliament and would like to move ahead with the GST constitutional amendment in the Monsoon Session, arguing it is pointless to hurt the economy. There are others, including it appears Rahul, who are arguing for a more strident line. It is likely they will prevail because the leader will finally decide for the party.
Though reduced to 44 seats in the Lok Sabha and having been turfed out of government in a series of states in the past 18-odd months, the Congress is currently punching above its weight. This is because it has 68 seats in the Rajya Sabha, only about a dozen short of the critical one-third mark needed to block a constitutional amendment in the 243-member Upper House. Gradually, starting March-April 2016, the Congress' numbers will drop but it will still have enough seats to play difficult in the Rajya Sabha should it want to.
However, Rahul's real problem is not so much in capturing media space or in Parliament, it is in getting his party ready for elections. The Congress is in the midst of a horrific phase and this is likely to continue in the coming year. It remains a marginal player in Bihar. In 2016, it could well slip to fourth place, behind even the BJP, in West Bengal and be wiped out in Tamil Nadu. It could also lose power in Assam. Uttar Pradesh in the summer of 2017 offers little hope, though Punjab, in the same period, gives the Congress a chance.
It is not until December 2017, when Gujarat sees its first non-Narendra Modi assembly election since 1998, that the Congress is in direct contest against the BJP in a major state. That is two-and-a-half years away. Meanwhile Rahul and the Congress need to sustain and prepare themselves. What is his plan? The now-you-see-me-now-you-don't activism, the photo-ops with street vendors one day and on a village charpoy the next, are all very well. Are they enough?(The author is senior fellow, Observer Research Foundation.

                            Rahul is not a capable leader to lead a party. He doesn't have any clarity in his thinking and surrounded by groups of sycophants. People of this Country who saw his pathetic interview with arnab during the last Lok sabha election knows it. It will be a shame if the congressmen makes him the party president.

                            Modi's image is not intact at all - it has been seriously dented by the scams and his inaction about them, very similar to Maun Mohan Singh, only worse because BJP leaders  never resign, they are more brazen. The question is whether Congress can gain from BJP's decline. It can't if it is led by a person as incompetent as Gandhi. If Congress was not a dynastic party, and it was led by leaders who show some level of competence like Sachin Pilot, Scindia, Chidambaram and Tharoor, then there will be hope. People are understanding how brazen Modi is about corruption. Would UPA have done what is happening in the HRD Ministry where the junior minister is on trial for forging marksheets?  And the senior minister is Irani!

                            I am afraid the writer has been too gracious and generous to Rahul, crediting him with a 'strategy, even assuming he has one'. Rahul can hardly be accused of being original in anything he has said and done so far in over ten years, and nothing demonstrates this more than his sudden fire and fury within and without Parliament, with cheap and childish jibes aimed at Modi personally, post his 58 days Holiday,Vipassana, Meditation or whatever. Add, the rush to join any street demonstration by as diverse crowds as the Delhi Safai Karmcharis, the OROP soldiers, the illegally squatting street and platform traders and of course, the farmers, besides other groups of whatever colour or kind. (These are by no means new problems but only a few among many on whom his mother's Government was sitting over for TEN years and longer). These so called 'strategy' oriented moves, including the 'short, loud and aggressive bursts followed by long pulls' are nothing but a totally unflattering imitation of the Keriwal school of politics: shoot and scoot, even uttering lies and then avoid or obfuscate answers. Rahul evidently saw that Kejri having fooled the people and the media successfully with such tactics for so long must be right (witness his 67 out of 70!). Rahul has therefore adopted this as 'his' brand too but, unlike Kejriwal, he could not cut any ice with anyone, except his own loyal Congress yes men, and has failed miserably.

                            Rahul remains an irresponsible leader. He lacks depth. Congress always wants a leader from the dynasty and Rahul was an automatic choice for them. But Rahul is not very capable. Also his brother-in-law is one of the most successful looter of the nation and that weakens his grand stands.

                            Hindus have destroyed India by bringing in a religious fanatic as PM. it is now up to the minorities to combine, vote en masse and remove this PM and replace him with secular leadership of Rahul Gandhi. Hindu fundamentalism is damaging every aspect of Indian society. If required the minorities must bring in militant activism by joining forces with naxalites and other such groups to control and bring down the hindu agenda of this government.

                            Rahul's lack of clarity on all issues is because he is not interested in politics, running this country or even in what happens in this country. Even after more then a decade of being in politics, Rahul can't spell out exactly what ails India, he still looks like a tourist exploring the place. That shows either Rahul's heart is not in what he is doing or that he is dumb or is in his own world. <br/><br/>
Till date, Rahul has not said what provisions of the land bill are anti-farmer &amp; I guess he doesn't know himself. His chamcha's said its anti-farmer and he repeats that line. Good for him that in India rhetoric works better then hard figures &amp; facts which allows Rahul to 'cry tiger' and run away. As they say, repeat a lie 10 times and people will start believing it. Rahul himself plus his puppy, the media, who have smartly never asked him specific &amp; tough questions, have ensured that many people believe land bill is anti-farmer. <br/><br/>
If Rahul is genuinely concerned or aware of what the problem with the NDA govt's land bill is then he will spell out how the act needs to be improved. In Jaipur few days back he repeated the line that Ashok Gehlot gave free medicines to citizens in Rajasthan which BJP hasn't. Despite the freebies his party scored a big zero in elections. Any other politician would rethink on their strategy but not Congress. they continue with this zamindar attitude where the Gandhi's are the owner's or kings who will give away free food, medicines, clothes to their subjects. <br/><br/>
The reason for Congress's downfall in May 2014 was that people didn't want to be treated like poor, illiterate fools who squat on the floor with their hands folded as someone from the Gandhi family speaks to them promising to give them freebies. Rahul has failed to see the aspirational Indian and he never will because it's not in Congress's DNA to treat citizens of this country as their equal's because of the many dynastiies in congress They keep thinking they are the ruler's and are born to rule.<br/><br/>
If Rahul was genuinely concerned about the land bill he would take an appointment with the PM, FM, agriculture &amp; industries minister and try to solve the problem. Instead he visits BJP ruled states (as in congress states wouldn't have land acquisition act applicable to them!), trashing the land bill and stalls parliament blocking every bill.

If bjp lose Bihar , that will mark final nail in coffin  of modi wave after Delhi disaster. It's extremely important for country  that modi and his chamcha are brought to ground. The only way to stop this brazenness is successive electoral defeats and strip them of majority.

                            @Saheb_and_chamchas : "Rahul has nothing to lose..". So very true. What can a loser lose? And, keep dreaming. It costs nothing.
