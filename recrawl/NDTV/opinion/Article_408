Headline::::Make No Mistake. This Is Modi's Defeat



DateTime::::2015-02-10T21:31:00+05:30



(Siddharth Varadarajan is a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Public Affairs and Critical Theory, Shiv Nadar University)
	Narendra Modi, as the saying goes, should have been careful about what he wished for. "Jo desh ka mood hai," he declared during the election campaign for the Delhi assembly, "wahi Dilli ka mood hai." Now that Delhi has given the Aam Aadmi Party 67 out of 70 seats and 54 per cent of the popular vote, the Prime Minister must be wondering what this means for the emerging mood elsewhere in the country.
	To understand the scale of the defeat that Modi - who was not just the face and voice of his party's campaign but its totem as well - has just led his party to, consider this simple statistic: the 3 seats the BJP managed to win under his leadership this time represent a massive 95 per cent drop from the 60 assembly segments he delivered in the 2014 general election, and a 78 per cent fall from what the party's local leadership managed on its own in December 2013. In that election, Rahul Gandhi, by contrast, had at least managed 20 per cent of the Congress party's 2009 Lok Sabha tally. His MPs would fit in a bus, people joked at the time. Modi's MLAs can get around Delhi in an auto-rickshaw.
	Had the BJP won, the party would have exulted in the potency of the Modi wave and the master strategizing of it president Amit Shah. But now that the Great Leader has failed to get even the meagre waters of the Yamuna to make way for his juggernaut, this defeat will be pinned not on his "56-inch chest", or even on Shah, but on the drooping shoulders of Kiran Bedi and the party's city leadership. Success in the BJP has not many but only one father; failure, on the other hand, can never be his fault.
	I have written elsewhere about the blunders the BJP committed in the run up to the Delhi election and the reasons behind the AAP's re-emergence. But the scale of AAP's victory -- and the BJP's defeat -- suggests some fundamental shifts in the political tectonics of Delhi, and perhaps even of India as a whole.
	Ironically, Modi's victory in 2014 was meant to represent that fundamental shift -- the arrival of a new "aspirational" India that wanted economic betterment and did not trust the "handout" politics of the past. When the voters of Delhi were exhorted to "move ahead with Modi", the BJP was trying once again to hold out the same promise of inclusive development that allowed it to increase its vote share in the capital from 33 to 46 per cent last year. The fact that the BJP's popular vote has fallen back to 33 per cent suggests the "aspirational" section of the electorate deserted it this time.
	Why did these voters leave the BJP and go over to the AAP? Because eight months of Modi rule at the Centre have made it clear that while the BJP makes vague announcements for the poor, it delivers concrete results for the corporate sector. Like the ordinance which makes it easier for the land of farmers and adivasis to be acquired and made over to industry. Like labour laws and environmental reform which make it easier for industry to violate existing standards. The citizens of Delhi may not have experienced what these changes mean, but they are clever enough to realise the development being pursued isn't quite inclusive.
	The aspirational voter also aspires to her vision of modernity, to a life in which the individual's right to live, dress, work, travel,  love and enjoy life as she likes is as important as economic progress. For young voters, the Sangh Parivar's cretinous attempts to dictate cultural and lifestyle choices are completely unacceptable; and while they are not moved by the traditional politics over "secularism", they are smart enough to see the dangers that the RSS's divisive sectarian agenda holds out for their city and country.
	Modi's complicity-by-silence with the book burners, film vandals and religious hate-mongers has not gone unnoticed among the swing voters he attracted just one year ago.
	I argued earlier that the BJP's '3 M strategy' - Modi, Money and Mud-slinging - failed to cut any ice with Delhi's voters. One day before votes were cast, the party played a fourth M card, majoritarianism, by trying to whip up hysteria over the unsolicited support declared by the Shahi Imam of the Jama Masjid for AAP. No less a leader than Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was deployed in a last-ditch attempt to inject religious polarization, but the strategy failed when Aam Aadmi leaders rejected the Imam's offer and accused the BJP of activating him in order to communalise the campaign.
	As we look beyond Delhi for the national implications of the BJP's spectacular defeat, two questions loom large: one for the BJP, the other for the opposition.
	First, will Modi and the BJP learn from the Delhi result and put an end to the divisive politics of the Sangh Parivar? And will the PM realise he cannot carry the electorate on announcements alone, that sooner rather later he must deliver on the promises he made of mass employment, growth, sanitation and infrastructure? A rational leadership would read the Delhi result as a small-sample expression of the emerging national mood and put in place a major course correction. But my sense is that Modi and Amit Shah are not likely to act rationally. Already we see attempts to ring-fence the "national government"and its policies. In the absence of any change, there is also the danger that the BJP's negative, sectarian impulses may actually sharpen.
	As for the opposition, the question on everyone's mind today is how easily can the AAP's act of stopping the Modi wave be replicated elsewhere. The short answer, of course, is "not very easily". Looking at the 2014 general election and all the major state elections we have seen so far -- Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, and Delhi -- this "wave" needs two conditions in order to prevail. First, a ruling party discredited by corruption, poor governance and anti-incumbency. And second, the lack of a strong, clear alternative to the BJP.
	In 2014, the UPA was discredited and there was no real 'national' alternative to the BJP. The same was true of Haryana, where the Hooda government was swept aside by the Modi wave. But the Modi factor showed its limits in Maharashtra because of the Shiv Sena, and in Jharkhand, where an alliance with the All-Jharkhand Students Union was needed to push the BJP over the finishing line. In Delhi, the AAP was unencumbered by negativity and was the obvious choice for anyone unhappy with the BJP. That is why the Modi machine was stopped in its track.
	Can these circumstances be replicated in Bihar? Perhaps, if Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal and Lalu Yadav's RJD stay united and strong, and remedy the poor governance record of the past year. But in West Bengal, it is the BJP that is looking to play the same 'third alternative' role to the Trinamool and the Left that the AAP played in Delhi, and there it is likely to meet a measure of success.
	The victory of AAP has galvanised non-BJP parties everywhere.  In Jammu and Kashmir, the Peoples Democratic Party may feel tempted to drive a harder bargain with the BJP now about a coalition government. However, in its most essential sense, what has defeated the BJP in Delhi is not some tactical alignment of political forces, but the emergence of New Politics. Only if this New Politics -- whether under the leadership of the AAP or of other kindred forces -- begins to take hold elsewhere, will Modi's national supremacy come under serious strain.

                            I have liked your analysis elsewhere , sir , but this one you got it wrong. There is a reason Kejriwal did not make this campaign against modi...but for something. This is just a case of people liked what Kejriwal promised , things that are local , and the credibility of some delivery happening in those 49 days ..wanted them to experiment. This has no implications for Bjp national wide. However , for the other parties struggling with defeats against modi time and again , there are lessons to be learnt. The only way to counter it is with a corruption free , credentials and people empowerment. not just plotting caste equations. The indian voter is more sensible than you give him credit for.

Modi did what it could, blame the local mla's, mp's and the Councillors, APP was able to convince that they can make a difference, we shall see what it dose, would you criticize their failure.<br/>

                            Vardarajan sir - BJP has more or less hold on to the 33% votes they got in Delhi last year (not LS election which was Modi wave). That is the limitation of the BJP only 50% of hindus votes to BJP. If the remaining 60% get split between others they will win else they wont. This just exposes the weakness of BJP nothing more nothing less. AAP did wonder by able to consolidate the muslim and the so called secular hindu vote.

                            Sir, Hon'ble Prime Minister is a quick learner. It took 13 years for him to face his first defeat. However, despite all opposition uniting against BJP, still were not able to shake the core voter base of Modi in Delhi (which was 33% in 2013). I am sure you must have managed the expectations of many people, but managing expectations of 125 crs people sometime do create annoyance. I assure you, you will not get this opportunity in Bihar Elections and personally would love to read your blog then. Wishing you and BJP the very best for the next tussle in Bihar.

They will have same fate of people of Andhra Pradesh who in 2004 have voted out TDP and voted in congress as they have promised free power to farmers and Chandra Babu was concentrating on Technology. But now after10 years their state is divided and no place for them People of Delhi made a wrong choice though rightly but they may suffer as a consequence.

                            Mr Varadarajan who has pathological hatred towards Modi, BJP and RSS will get opportunity to vent his frustration and come with funny and illogical articles. Such journalists who sit and debate in studios did not have any idea about the ground situation in Delhi. They were predicting a close fight between BJP and AAP, but the results tell a different story. It is better now to draw much conclusion from Delhi results as each state has a different dynamics.

                            yes it is a defeat for the BJP,Mr.Modi &amp; Ms.Bedi and other leaders of the BJP. I am sure they made mistakes some of them avoidable and the BJP leadership will learn from this but surely no reasonable person  expects the BJP to sweep every election in every state in India.<br/><br/>
The rest of the prose is only about a constipated Mr.Varadarajan taking a huge dump to vent his frustration after eight months of a series of sweeping battles won by the BJP. Clearly it had given him a lot of heartburn.

                            Pondicherry and Delhi have the same status as per the constitution of India. Both are union territory states where there is an elected assembly and a chief minister. Does any one know the name of the chief minister of pondicherry?? Unlikely. This is because such small union territory states are insignificant when compared to the country and bigger states. Always After Publicity party has managed to fool the people of Delhi yet again, but going by their celebrations, it looks like Mr Mufflerman is going to cough his way to the Parliament to take oath as the PM of the country. Would some one tell these jokers how insignificant they are and show them some perspective? And as for BJP going in an auto/nano, perhaps the MP's from AAP can use the same auto/nano to go to the Parliament after that...unless they have already reached there on their two-wheeler.

It doesn't suit any person with reasonable academic record and mature person and supposed to be "neutral" or apolitical commentator. I recommend you should read Mr. Harsh Pant's opinion before two days, in case you missed. He certainly was not praising BJP or Modi, but quite objective. Rest is your choice.

                            You are always off target in your analysis. Common citizen of India wants jobs. Better quality of life, govt should serve his needs rather than behaving like sarkar. modi won in 2014 because Congress was arrogant. AAP won because BJP had become complacent and arrogant. All this Ghar Wapsi are all media hyping some stupid activity by right wing fringe elements. All caste and communities want good quality of life. That's the bottom line. All other analysis are your imaginations. Infact you came up with strange statistic to prove effectiveness of Rahul Gandhi. You lost your. Redibility there itself as someone whose opinion is important. India is aspiring for success. That's why underdogs like Kejriwal and Modi are winning. Sorry for Ajay Maken.

                            This is not a Modi defeat at all. Remember your words and in the other election results you will praise the party. Yes it was the arrogance of the BJP which let it down. When Arvind Kejriwal and AAP were door to door campaigning in Delhi, BJP was busy with elections in Jharkhand, J&amp;K and Maharashtra. Arrogancy of BJP was here and when they realized they have been left behind, they pulled up their socks by which time it was very late. Even Arvind distanced away from a direct fight with PM and instead gave the slogan MODI for PM, ARVIND for CM. Well in a democracy this is the best thing which can happen. BJP should no not to take voter for granted. But people are getting over joyous. This is no alternative politics as being said. Even AAP has 22 members which have criminal cases against them. Arvind has won this massive victory just on the lines of Modi's 2014 victory. So the expectations would be massive. And seeing this results I can surely say one thing people of India have become very impatient.

I think today's results show that reasonable citizens of this country have just about had enough of the blind cult-of-personality and negativity that is the only USP of this bhakt brigade.

                            Folks and including the writer - I have strongest faith in Modiji irrespective of this Delhi results. Congress's decimation helped AAP win seats, that was very clear. BJP retained its vote share but could not eat up from Congress despite presenting a face like Kiran Bedi.

                            This is just a flash in the pan. Can AAP defeat BJP anywhere else in India? Yes the BJP committed mistakes like suddenly bringing in Kiran Bedi as CM candidate. There are some lessons. Firstly do not try to fool the voter - Delhi voters knew that Modi was not the BJP's CM candidate, so why vote for him? Secondly, voters are very shrewd and distinguish between Lok Sabha and state elections. Local issues dominate state elections. Third, Kiran Bedi had no political profile in Delhi and the voters did not know what she stood for. She was rightly seen for what she was - an opportunist. Projecting the right CM candidate is as important as projecting the right PM candidate. The BJP goofed up big time this time. Fourth, Obama's visit caused severe inconvenience to the aam admi of Delhi for no returns at all. Modi's personal vanity may have been satisfied, but at the cost of the BJP's electoral fortunes. Introspect Amit Shah, introspect.

                            Siddharth, the logic for BJPs defeat is simple.  BJPs vote share went down by just 1% compared to last elections.  What turned the tide was former congress votes, which fully went to AAP.  Now, people who earlier voted for Congress had an option to vote for either the BJP or AAP (as they knew that a vote for Congress would be a waste).  They decided to vote for AAP instead of BJP.  Why is this surprising?  They were after all Congress votes, which also meant that they were anti-BJP votes.  BJP would have never got these votes whatever they did, or whatever they didn't.  Simple.  Did BJP deserve this?  Probably, as the last victory led them to an arrogant belief that they were invincible.  Hopefully, BJP will now realize that the only way forward for them, if they want to survive and take India to greater heights, is to fall back on the idea that they were able to sell so successfully during last central elections.

                            A good analysis. BJP needs to change its strategy big-time. Failing to do so will cost them Bihar. A loss that will be harder to swallow than Delhi. I do not think current drama being played in Bihar by Nitish Kumar have not hurt Janata's chances yet. But if BJP wants to conquer the state, it needs to go back to good old days (Apr 2014) and revive developmental agenda.

                            One thing for sure Kejriwal or AAP did not *defeat* Modi. If Modi had not stooped down to name calling (chor, etc.), had not made whirlwind tours to campaign for party candidates, the result would have meant a simple rejection of BJP candidates by Delhi voters. Unfortunately, Modi's advisors  overestimated his greatness and invincibility and now he is slapped with embarrassment. That Modi's ideas and values are *rejected* by Delhi voters is not the same as Modi is defeated.

                            if you give a closer look at the election results of Delhi...BJP's vote share is almost similar to Dec'13...it's actually congress that has lost 15% of it's vote percentage in just over 1 year...and all of this went to AAP...which made sure this big victory for them....so actually it's time for congress to introspect much more than anybody....yes BJP also needs to check that why their vote % didn't increase....also I would say that in a healthy democracy one party should not completely dominate everywhere as BJP was doing since a while, as it makes them arrogant...so my point of view AAP should grow more...and become one of two biggest parties in India along with BJP...and they should both keep a check on each other's work....this would make sure that the government of states ruled by them are working hard and the country is moving in right direction...jai HIND!!!!

This will enable the people of the state to assess and evaluate the performance of the party in power denying them opportunity for blaming the number games in the assembly for slow progress in the decision makings in the state. Decisive mandate for BJP in LS election last year(7/7), decisive mandate for AAP in Assembly elections this time(almost 70/70). They have given both Modi and Kejriwal opportunities to perform. <br/>
Salute to the people of Delhi on the verdict. Kejriwal has definitely lost his freedom to lead dharnas in Delhi and play the victim. Time to perform.

                            This is a positive vote for Kejriwal and not a negative vote against Modi. Voters believe that Kejri will be able to end bribery and provide cheap electricity, free water and free WiFi. But the voters also fully understand that Modi is doing all that he can to deliver on mass employment, growth, sanitation and infrastructure. In all fairness, Modi should be given 5 years to deliver on what he promised. No doubt, Modi will be voted out in 2019 if he fails and so will Kejri in 2020 if he doesn't deliver.

                            I dont know why this shouldnt be called PM Modi's defeat.. because.. he was the man heading elections in Lok Sabha and won phenomenally. The way he had promised and speeched about himself and his vision, I think with the last 9 months in rule, his vote share should have increased. BJP still had 33% vote share that it originally had.. very well but when such a man was in power shouldn't the votes have increased. And why not count the 17% votes that had joined that 33% during Lok Sabha elections but then backed away this time.

                            What happened is there was a shift in voting, 15% Congress votes (including Muslim votes) + 8 % others ( BSP/JD/CPI/Independents) voted for AAP. Therefore AAP vote share surged from 29.7% to 54.3 %. It is a pure and simple a victory for Anti-BJP forces. BJP vote share dropped just 1 % from 33 to 32 % which is no big deal.

                            I think most our so called analysts in their desperation to link the Delhi elections to central govt and Modi has overlooked a more simpler and likely explanation.  This election is not about the voter showing anger at the ruling BJP govt rather it is about the voter being more attracted to style of functioning of the Aam admi party than it is with the more traditional approaches of the BJP. In other words its not about how the BJP has gone down(which it hasn't by much in terms of vote share) rather this is about how the AAP has gone up.  Competition is not just a race to the bottom.  AAP appears to be a better version of the BJP (minus modi), so obviously people voted for a better party,  not because they wanted to bring down the BJP. Aravind should try to continue on this path of positive politics, where competition is directed upwards. That's what we need more of in other states as well.  Let every party fight hard to impress the voter.

                            victory /success/ defeat failure are all part of a strong political career ..and mr.Narendra modi is a seasoned politician..He would definitely learn from his mistakes..and Mr Amit shah would  also open to suggestions after the delhi fiasco..and BJP definitely look seriously into the matters..So just dont simply write off BJP or Modi or Shah ....Ofcourse AAP has come out strong but defintely people are having high hopes on it and Road ahead is more tough for them compared to other parties.

                            What happened is there was a shift in voting, 15% Congress votes (including Muslim vote bank ) + 8 % others ( BSP/JD/CPI/Independents) voted for AAP. Therefore AAP vote share surged from 29.7% to 54.3 %. It is a pure and simple a victory for Anti-BJP forces. BJP vote share dropped just 1 % from 33 to 32 % which is no big deal.

                            Modiji ,<br/><br/>
Standard of Indian PM should never come down Your representing 1.2 billion indian<br/>
In delhi election campaign it showed clearly attacking a common man.<br/>
I think that played a big factor for defeat <br/><br/>
A tough challenge for all BJP representative to create a image back <br/><br/>
All BJP need to work harder &amp; honestly to gain the faith back<br/><br/>
Modiji we voted BJP only for you &amp; we expect a better standard every day

                            As a AAP follower, we should focus on country improvement rather than trashing on BJP losses. Does it really matter ? I guess our development should be prime focus now.

                            @sri:VHP is not an political party and if an MP, mla refuse to respect vandemataram or refuse to support family planning than that is a big issue. Also PK was not banned but given tax credit in some states but movies like Viswaroopam and Davince code were banned in many states. Davince code was not even banned in vatican. The VHP, BD did not kell any body and because they dont get any support from govt like the minority goups, they do small acts of breaking windows of movie theatres which is nothing compared to the riots (mumbia martyrs insult and abuse of women cops) and bloodshed ( chopping off the hands of a professor in kerala).

                            It is the defeat of the "drag" on Modi. Modi has suffered loss of image but emerged more powerful in the party as he can be stern with the loose cannons in the party. Shah should take the blame for making compromises on morals and principles by making the BJP "Congress-yukt" and "AAP-yukt". In spite of comments to this effect from day one that Lutyens Delhi is not Ahmedabad, he tried his tricks and cost Modi his image. Repeat these blunders and the good work expected of Modi will come to an abrupt halt. Only Sakshi and his ilk will be proved right (rocking Modi's boat). How does anybody think of allowing the likes of Adityanath, Sakshi, Jyoti, and the other lady ( 40 Pillay) to even address the voters in the national capital? AAP is allergic to colour saffron and has made a bold statement by selecting only green and white--secularism !!!

                            Like TDP in Andhra, TRS in Telangana, Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, TMC in West Bengal, BJD in Odisha, SP in UP, RJD in Bihar, JMM in Jharkhand, DMK/AIADMK in TN, SAD in Punjab, Communists or Muslim League in Kerala, AAP is just another REGIONAL party for Delhi State.Nothing more need to be read into it. If luck permits,it make take another 2 or 3 or 4 decades for AAP, on its own to form a Govt in some other state. Till then, comparing it with National Parties like BJP is preposterous.Let them govern Delhi properly first.

                            Sure....if after Jharkhand, Maharashtra,Madhya Pradesh, Chattishgarh, Rajasthan and Haryana; had Mr Vardarajan written a article "Make No Mistake. This Is Modi's Win", his stance would have been understandable.<br/><br/>
I am big AAP supporter and small donor, they have brought new class of politics to the front. I also undertand its just a Delhi, we are long way to replicate this on national scale. What the columnist like Mr Vardarajan need to understand is the proper mood of the Aam Adami like us, we would rather see Modi as PM than Rahul Dufus Gandhi, if god willing one day AAP grows in momentum nationwide we would rather like to see Kejriwal than Modi. <br/><br/>
For us the choices are clear, who is better than whom. Its just that when we read all these articles from so called intellectuals, we feel like all the credit goes to Modi, Nitish, Lalu or even Kejriwal we the real people are like herd of donkeys who dont act or react to the situation. We just play coy to master machination of our puppet masters.<br/><br/>
Yup this is AAP talk, where individual feels empowered.

                            Delhi was a unique case, this is the first and last for AAP. Somehow these anti-Modi baiters seem to care more about their hatred towards BJP than about the country's welfare.
