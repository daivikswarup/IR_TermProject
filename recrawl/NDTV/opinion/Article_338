Headline::::Captain Vikram Batra's Mother On Quitting AAP



DateTime::::2014-12-31T22:27:00+05:30



(Kamal Kant Batra, 69, contested the national election this year from Himachal Pradesh as a candidate of the Aam Aadmi Party. In 1999, her son, Captain Vikram Batra, was killed in the Kargil War. He was 24. "Yeh dil maange more," he had declared famously, appropriating the Pepsi tagline at the time to convey the courage of the Indian soldier.)As told to NDTV.comI decided to resign from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on December 30, after joining it 10 months earlier. I was deeply unsatisfied with the functioning and the organisational structure of AAP. It failed to appeal to me. The party has been a let-down at the state level here in Himachal, and even the national functioning of the party has not impressed me. I would not like to go into detail and criticise the party, but things are not 'proper'.I'd been thinking about resigning for a while. In fact, my husband, on my behalf, attended the state and national level meetings of the party just a few days ago but we'd been completely inactive in party matters for the last two months.When I joined the party, the Aam Aadmi Party had requested us to fight the elections, saying that we were reputed and well-known people, and they offered us a Lok Sabha ticket from Hamirpur. We'd thought the party would make a difference. I am happy that despite being new to the field of politics, we still stood third out of 10 candidates in the elections. But after the results, the organisational structure and the functioning of the party has gone downhill and left me disappointed.After I said I would quit, so far I have not received any calls from senior members of the party - Arvind Kejriwal and others. But we have received some calls from our region and they have appealed to us to reconsider as they say that this would be a setback for the party in the state. I have not sent a written resignation to anyone yet, but will soon send my resignation to Arvind Kejriwalji by email or by post.The first thing that always appealed to me about the Aam Aadmi Party was their stand against corruption. Second, they brought fresh faces to Indian politics: people from all backgrounds, rich and poor, across all levels. And the third thing that I like about this party is that they have highlighted the defects of the previous governments and parties.As I mentioned before, the things I didn't like about AAP are their working, poor functioning and organisational chaos. Also, there is a lot of 'big bossism'. No one from the party, neither Mr Kejriwal nor any member of the national leadership has contacted us after the elections.Right now there are no plans of joining any other party. Whether I want to continue in politics, only time will tell. But at present, I'm not in a mood to join any political party.My advice to Mr Kejriwal would be that he should run his party in a completely democratic way. Every man in an organization is important. Everyone should be given due weightage and due regard.And for Mr Modi,  I feel that he is trying his best. He seems to be on the right track. My advice - he should walk the talk on all his promises, only then can our country progress.Nationalism and patriotism are the two points that should always be kept in mind. He should definitely do more for the martyrs and their families, soldiers who put their life at stake for protecting our country.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Aunty, Happy New Year, I always recall your son and my Elder Brother Major Vikram Batra," Dil mange More" is what kept keeps me going . Many Indians might not remember it as a PepsiCo slogan, but more will connect with our beloved Brother and a great solider, I pay my greatest respect for your son. I was quite a bit shocked when you criticized Modi for invoking Major Name, now I am very happy that you have left APP, they are against what your son fought,

                            Ma'am, you should have stayed and helped the party grow in Himachal. Please remember that the party is made up of people who are not political, who are professionals in fields other than politics. AAP needs all the help and support, else the only hope we have of seeing a corruption mukt bharat will only remain a dream. Please don't quit now, we need the help of everyone.

What is she expecting - whenever someone thinking about quitting AAP then AK have to call and ask them to stay with them. Are they not joined hands for Noble cause... are they just expecting some respect and pride??? please do join in politics for service and do it with humble and if you expect something out of politics better stay away...<br/><br/>
 if you are inactive and sending husband for meetings why should someone (seniors) have to call you to stay in party...??? I don't understand. But I accept your point AAP have to fix some things - one major thing is adjustments for Indian politics... AAP can be adamant on everything... they have to consider reality (how can we stop corruption overnight???)

                            Madam, I have utmost respect for you, who is a mother of martyr,but I should add that you may not be fit for politics. AAP is a new party (I am not a member of AAP) and you would be considered the founding members of your party in your state, therefore you would be responsible for bringing in that organizational structure. Additionally, working for AAP is very much like working for a start-up, you need discipline and big bossism, also, I am not saying that you are wrong. BJP and Congress are established parties, and i am sure Vajpayeeji faced similar problems when he famously put the foundation for BJP.

                            I have utmost resqect for Captain Batra and his parents who have given their son for this country. However, here the reasons given by her to quit the party are not at all convincing. She talks about chaotic and disorganized functioning and also of big bossism. Thats contradictory. If their is big bossism then their won't be chaos. The chaos happens only when their functioning is democratic. She didn't get enough attention from top rung of the party. Is that reason enough to become upset?

                            AAP must not stand candidate above 65 yrs and physically and mentally inactive ppl. With age ppl loose their capacity. It should also avoid leaders who are only emotional rather pratical and ran away from adverse situations.

The core value of AAP is still the same - to fight against the corrupt system. Their USP is their honesty and that is definite need for the country.

                            As usual Media quick to report on anything remotely negative about AAP. Just proves that the party on right track. As for Captain Vikram Batra´s mother, she may be right. The party is still new and in chaos and that is the reason AAP is focussing in Delhi. And rightly so.

                            With due respect to  Batras, this is what happens when a small, resource less party bring in Prima Donnas like Batras, Captain Gopinath, Udaykumar types in to the fold. they think they are so important that the moment they sneez AK will come rushing down from Delhi! Or before taking ever breath he will ask their opinion! These people take themselves too seriously and are basically activists and at best reluctant politicians. I would say that party is now getting in to shape by shedding the unwanted baggage like Batras! Good riddance mam!

Madam you look confused! as much as Modi in the national limelight. You are made for each other.

                            Madam sends her resignation to party on 30th December and is on national media on 31st December complaining that she has not received a call from AK.  The biggest criticism I could find is 'organizational chaos', perceived 'big bossism', because Madam did not get response from Arvind the same day.

                            Leaving the party on the basis of un-organised is not correct. AAP is standing toll against the corrupt , high black money pressure and surviving with limited and honest resources. People are so callous and so ruthless and seem to be very happy with 196 criminals in Parliament. Now Indians should not regret all the atrocities, rapes corruption as they have chosen all criminals.. Thanks Indian for dealing so harshly AAP and appreciating the all corrupt parties like BJP and congress!!!!

Of course no disrespect to Vikram; but being a hero's mom doesn't make you a leader or a thinker apparently. How can you accuse a party of being driven by few, while expecting those few only to touch base with everyone? If you had it in you, you would try to establish the party in HP. Since you don't, so Kejriwal is the problem. It's sad how people want everything from Kejriwal without doing anything themselves.

                            AAP even put it about that this lady should have a free run.  They urged other candidates to withdraw as this lady was the mother of a martyr. I commend her for seeing through this bunch of jokers who deride anybody from any other party trying to practice honest politics.  In any case, look at the 'top honchos' of the party: Somnath Bharti is probably continuing to run his internet porn empire using proxies, Ashutosh is probably composing schoolboy essays that nobody will take seriously, Khetan is probably shouting at other 'panel' guests in one or the other TV studios, Kejriwal is probably busy seeking takers for chai with him costing Rs 20,000 or a selfie for Rs200.  Kejriwal is probably also trying to find space is jail where he is going to put 'mediawalas'!  I wonder what happened to the character Kumar Vishwas (more true to say Kumar Bukwas) who regarded himself as the world's greatest poet and promised to live in Amethi?  Is he still there? What happened to Shazia Ilmi? Does she still think Kejriwal is brilliant? What happened to Captain Gopinath? Still 'captaining' this bunch of losers?  Only one way forward for this collection of opportunistic chancers: OBLITERATION!!!!!

                            For new party how things can be so organised. At age of 70 its even too hard to cope up with such new party who all big bulls are against. AAP need people how can struggle and bring process and get thing organised not who are looking for all organised and piece of cake. M not criticising anyone who are leaving aap but m just telling the need of call in aap.

                            Still we hope the AAP will learn the lessons and come out stronger- to fulfill our dream of corruption free India - clean India.

                            Madam. Like the balance sheet is drawn only after the end of every financial year, so should be the promises made by Modi at the end of his tenure. Expecting everything within six months is being a bit too childish and immature. You very well know the damages done by the previous govt. Firstly, to correct that and move in the positive direction takes time. Give him some time and then start commenting.

                            Unfortunate! But you cant expect a two year old party to have a 'Proper' structure.  The question is what you did to see the change you wanted to see.<br/>
After LS elections I have seen new leadership emerge in the party..  The likes of Meera Sanyal &amp; Adarsh Shastri  are doing their best.

                            I think we should apply restraint while personally commenting on a "shaheeds" aged mother/parents. I think they were duped by the "banya".

                            Both sides have to address the issues. Old people especially after 60 should gracefully reject any heavy duty and stressful activities as their energy level and ego will not allow them to handle that level. Similarly AAP should take these issues seriously to address the organisation for better functioning. Most of the first timer who wanted quick name and fame entered AAP. They wanted quick reward and never calculated the difficult path of politics. However, it is good that they leave the party with little noise. I don't support AAP but I support emergence of new and fresh parties to challenge the old lethargic parties.

                            You could have stayed and built the organisational structure in your state or district. But instead you chose to quit! I am grateful that you atleast raised a son who did not understand the meaning of the word 'Quit'.

                            "Every man in an organization is important. Everyone should be given due weightage and due regard." Then why are you not respecting your region people who have approached you to stay and expecting a call from Arvind. You yourself are making him the boss and crying bossism. Its not AK's factory. Its your country. Why do you want AK's importance and attention. If you love your state, stay back and revive AAP in your region. Is Modi+Amit Shah+Rajnath combo not bossism, is Sonia, Mamta, Mulayam, Amma not bossism. Come on.. love your country don't cry on AK's shortcomings. Fix whatever is broken in AAP but please don't run away.

                            To expect AK to talk to a crore members and 450 leaders is asking for too much, Leaders have to be self made and not pampered by others.  How many issues has this lady raised in Uttarakhand, each of those 450 candidates have to build cadre and party in their own state.

                            One need to know what she did to make the party ( for which she fought the election) more relevant to the state of Himachal. or she was waiting for directions from Kejriwal. <br/>
AAP movement is for the People by the People for the responsive governance. Every individual need to do his/her part and should not wait for the directives.

                            Kejriwal is destroying the AAP party. The constitution of the party made on the strict philosophy must be the boss of the party and no single person should be the boss. It appears that this simple rule is violated by Kejriwal.
