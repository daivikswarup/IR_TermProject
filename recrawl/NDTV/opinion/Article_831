Headline::::The War Pakistan Lost and India Didn't Win



DateTime::::2015-09-14T19:34:00+05:30




                                Even halfway decent - and honest - military historians will tell you that the 1965 war was the last one that Pakistan had a chance of winning against India. It had better equipment, more advanced technologies, better and more focused NATO-standard training, a clearer doctrine and strategic objectives. It seems difficult to believe now, but even internally and politically, Pakistan then looked more cohesive than did India, which faced Naga insurgency, Dravida separatism and an unstable Kashmir.
Most importantly, the initiative was fully with Pakistan. It had chosen its timing, place and method of launching that war. Its purpose was to wrest the Kashmir Valley. Its leadership had concluded, quite correctly, that India's military modernisation was very well under way after the 1962 debacle against China. Another couple of years of expansion, re-equipment and consolidation would have made it decisively stronger militarily.
They were not wrong. Consider these technological and hardware advantages Pakistan had in 1965, giving it a clear military edge on the ground, in the air and over the seas:
Pakistan's American-made Patton was by far the best in the subcontinent. You could argue that India's British-made Centurion was its equal, but there were two problems. One, India had too few of these heavy tanks (about a half of Pakistan's Pattons). As a result, the Indian army had to allocate these very carefully. The rest of India's tanks were Second World War Shermans, and light French AMXs. In fact, India's defensive brigade which fought the main Pakistani thrust in Chhamb had only two squadrons of AMXs. Two, no Indian tank was night-capable whereas the Patton was. The only Indian superiority was in having a larger number of infantry divisions. But, as Lt General Harbaksh Singh notes in his "War Despatches", many of these were fresh, post-1962 raisings and not yet settled or fully battle-ready.
Pakistan had decidedly superior artillery and a much larger number of higher caliber US-made guns. These often tilted the balance when used in a massed profile, particularly in the open tank-infantry battles in the Sialkot sector, a fact documented well by Lt General Harbakhsh. In fact, he says that both Pakistani equipment and doctrine of artillery use were superior. More than 75 per cent of Indian casualties were caused by artillery. Pakistan also had a headstart in special/commando forces, as the Special Services Group (SSG) was already formed.
In the air, sidewinder missiles on F-86 Sabre as well as F-104 Starfighter gave Pakistan's Air Force a clear edge. IAF was still in the gun age. The first MiG-21 squadron was still coming up, and had only nine planes with pilots under conversion training. Further, F-104 was fully night-capable, as were some F-86s. India had no night-capable fighter/interceptors. This gave Pakistani bombers safer passage to Indian bases at night whereas Indian night bombers were unescorted and vulnerable to PAF defenders. With C-130 Hercules, Pakistan had a way superior transport fleet, also more capable of paratroop operations, which it tried.
On the naval front, India had a larger fleet. But Pakistan was already in the submarine age with the US-gifted Ghazi. So Pakistan was a clear dimension ahead. The Indian navy had inadequacies in sonar and submarine detection, so it wasn't entirely capable of fighting in that dimension. India's lone carrier INS Vikrant was then in dry dock, but even if it had been active, it would have had limited impact.
It was with all these factors in mind that Ayub and Bhutto finally embarked on this war. Their presumptions of decisive superiority were confirmed in their minds by the poor performance of the Indian defensive brigade in the Kutch sector earlier that year. Even the IAF had avoided combat there, and Pakistanis misread that as a disinclination to fight. Coming as it did soon after 1962, Pakistan decided - rightly on paper - that this was their moment.
Why did it not work out that way? There are some reasons on which reputed and fair chroniclers of both sides now agree. These include:
Arrogance on the part of Pakistani commanders. Lack of respect for the opposition and a foolhardy tendency to declare victory too soon. A prime example is how its brilliant armour thrust in Khem Karan, which had once seemed so threatening that General J.N Chaudhuri wanted to withdraw to a new defensive line behind Beas river, thus conceding most of Punjab (to be firmly dissuaded, fortunately, by Harbaksh), became, instead, in its biggest disaster. Destruction of its 1 Armoured Division here pretty much ended Pakistan's offensive capability in the plains in that war.
India's better doctrine and leadership of armour at fighting unit level. Better Indian performance in the mountains, particularly in battles at night. India gained territory across the hilly terrain in Kashmir, while losing a chunk in the plains in Chhamb.
Brilliant tactical dash on the part of Pakistan ruined by incompetent execution. Pakistan, for example, stunned India on September 6 with dusk raids on its forward airbases, particularly Pathankot, where 10 frontline aircraft were destroyed on the ground, but didn't know what to do thereafter. A few losses over Halwara and Adampur, and though it had an upper hand through that war, the PAF desisted from any further daytime raids over IAF bases.
No navy had the size to be able to weigh in on that war. But with the Indian navy definitely not battle-ready, the Pakistani navy wasted the opportunity with a symbolic though humiliating bombardment of Dwarka. It achieved no military purpose though.
Overall, Indian forces were very resolute and efficient in defensive battles as Khem Karan showed. This was totally contrary to Pakistani mythology that "Hindu" armies wouldn't be able to resist it, particularly after India's dismal record in 1962. Strategically, Pakistan miscalculated big-time, and stupidly, by believing any provocations in Kashmir would be met with a response confined there. And once India opened the Punjab front, it had to hurriedly fall back on defence.
All wars begin with miscalculation. The 1965 war was purely Pakistan's. It was their decision and initiative. It was based on a sound appreciation of relative military strengths that put the aggressor at advantage. Even politically and economically, India was going through multiple crises. But it failed for all the reasons discussed earlier. Only Pakistan had strategic objectives in this war and it failed to achieve any. That, to some extent, answers the question: who won this war and who lost? Since Pakistan failed to achieve any objectives, it definitely lost that war. But while it had the better of the land engagements, India did not win the war militarily. It was a strategic defeat for Pakistan but a military stalemate.(Shekhar Gupta hosts 'Walk the Talk' and 'Chalte Chalte' on NDTV.

                            Inspite of the fact that we suffered heavily in 1962, and as you mentioned that pakistan was having better military equipment, India undoubtedly had an upper hand at the time of cease fire.<br/>
All neutral analysts would tell you the fact that it was advantage india. We are a nation who likes to sympathise ourselves. Go back to history. Marathas were once in control of peshawar. Hemu was virtually invincible. Rajputs broke backbone of moguls. Sikhs were a force that gave nightmares to moguls,  but still you want us to believe in singing praises of moguls. Same pschology seems to be working behind this article.

                            Well it is difficult to believe for modern day people but there were miracles that happened in year 1965 &amp; 1971 war in favor of Indian army.. And details of that was described by Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh (ret.) , who died recently on April 11, 2015..  <br/>
One of miracle in his words is "Unknown to us in the dark, the Pakistanis had laid a very deep minefield across the route were following and on both banks of the Basantar River.  In the darkness of night, we would not have detected this minefield and a large number of our tanks either would have blown up on the mines or been destroyed by the enemy tanks covering those mines. The entire Regiment of tanks passed through the minefield that night without sustaining a single casualty"<br/>
 Pakis don't know that Allah was with India then and even now.  What would Pakis do if they lead the Indian subcontinent ? Make it burial ground on the name of Allah.. God knows that very well. Almighty wants to protect the earth for people to live happily but not leave it to the people of rigid faith and convert the earth to medieval times ..

Pakistan believed that Hindus did not have the "stomach to fight". We were weak, yes, in comparison to ourselves but how can we be ever weaker than Pakistanis!<br/><br/>
It is LBS's credit that we thwarted Pak in 1965 and to IG's credit that we defeated them decisively in 1971.

                            Equipments do not win wars. They help but they do not decide the outcome. It's the strategy, logistics and will power of the forces that win wars. Thankfully our military lacked none (with slight exception of logistics) in 1965.

                            I think you are wrong Shekhar. You yourself have accepted that Pakistan had the superior arms and machinery. Now you compare the losses of India and Pakistan. Pakistan's artillery and tanks being much superior (thanks to the policy followed by Nehru), they suffered much more losses (I think more than three times). So here India comes a clean winner.

                            we need to go back to the definition of win and a loss. Win is meeting your objective and loss is a failure to do so.  Pakistan was the aggressor and India was defender.  The objective for Pakistan was to free Kashmir and India was to defend it. By opening the Punjab sector,  they successfully defeated the first objective of Pakistan. The ball was in India court, they could have continued it but want very practical given the fact that we didn't have a clear objective of an aggressor,  it was only a defensive tactic.  We still ended up owning up their land,  which we foolishly have away.  We definitely have an upper hand and can be considered win based on points but for pakistan it was a silly plot and a heavy loss.

                            I have two comments. First, judgement which the author's has conveyed on '65 war i.e. 'The War Pakistan Lost and India Didn't Win'. Neither he has any experience of fighting wars, or any security expertise (even academic) or proved it by any research done  - to pass this judgement and place it in public domain to confuse them. Second, if author wants to make an attempt in deciding who won the war - then the basic fact needs to be understood. Wars are fought for political reasons and to achieve political aims. Indian Armed Forces have always won militarily but reciprocal political advantage has never been taken which includes '71 war. So in my opinion the media personalities can positively contribute to such security challenges by not writing such articles but by atleast winning the 'media war'. In current scenario media fraternity needs to win in J&amp;K and NE, which the author may like to address being his domain expertise .

                            Shekhar Gupta thinks the only way to stay relevant is to create some needless controversy or the other. Some time ago, in his fertile imagination, he had raked up a supposed mutiny in the Indian Army. There are far more instigating circumstances presently because of the BJP Government dilly dallying over OROP. The late Vinod Mehta had a very poor opinion of him as a journalist.

It was SHEER GRIT of LAL BAHADUR SHASTRI that we won the 65 war in spite of poor arms and equipments. and poor man was murdered by CONgressis as they want NEHRU Dynasty to carry on.

                            Good article but unfair typical SG deduction. India cannot be the looser as it did not wage the war Pakistan did, In any analysis the aggressor loses if their goals are not met. Pakistan did not meet the goal hence lost. India was the defender and despite all odds defended extremely bravely and well and even managed to secure large chunk of enemy territory. India met the goals a defender seeks and cannot be deduced as military defeat. Even with inferior military hardware spoiled the dream of the aggressor Pakistan. The title sounds poetic but well designed to show India unfairly in bad light as SG is well known for. India since 1965 victory has known Pak well &amp; played as per their weaknesses in the next two wars and also won.

                            Dear Mr. Gupta, You have rightly mentioned about a bit weak state of India in 1965, in initial years of post Nehru era, after China aggression, the draught also, Naga insurgency, Dravidian movement which thrown out Congress from TN in the name of caste. One more thing was the attitude of RSS-Jansangh who had started growing on Hindu agenda post independence, 1965 war gave them best opportunity for their propaganda. They opposed then PM Lal Bahadur Shahtri when he was in Tashkent on Indo-Pak meet post-war and on possibility of withdrawing Indian troops from occupied areas in Pakistan's territory. That actually put Mr. Shastri in great pressure before his return to India. Its unfortunate the same RSS-Jansangh mindset ruling this country today.

                            Pak wanted Kashmir, launched an offensive and failed. On the other hand, with better weaponry at hand as pointed in the article, they were forced to start defending their main cities in a short time. Indian forces were threatening to capture Lahore and Sialkot, having Pak on its knees. It is to India's credit that we decided not to push for it and accept the ceasefire. This should be considered a resolute military victory for India

                            Shekhar Gupta has a very perfect analysis of 1965 war. We had a worst Nehru time 1962 and than again a1965,surprisingly he had not touched the policy of than government and further during 1948 Kashmir occupation by Pakistan, it was a first defeat for India by not pushing back Pakistani invaders and rushed to UN instead of giving strong reply and capture that territory,Nehru was a coward PM and was talking  Panchshil and non alliance stupidity that resulted 1962 China attack. So Shekhar Gupta cover ups congress often for such biggest mistake and inactions of Nehru and his ancesotrs who were bunch of stupid and gave us all time headache of Kashmir.Nehru had all dynastic thoughts like our Mogul and British time rajput kingdoms,who always scared of uniting and fighting war instead talking peace and losing territories also quietly only worried for his dynesty.

                            Article writer is totally biased as what to expect from Indian writer self created stories though the world media is totally opposite from his self Victorial stories which are based on lies.

                            what a shame. even after 50 years India is struggling to justify it's loss with foolish reasons.<br/><br/>
When Khalistan will become independent from Indian soil, India will again try to justify for next 50 years, maybe the same kind of stupid reasons as mentioned here.<br/><br/>
I dare if this comment is posted. I know it will not. Nobody likes to see hia face in the mirror now a days.

                            For that matter none of the war India win really including 1971 Bangladesh Victory. It was a war won by military lost on negotiation table. I presume Indira was drunk while signing Shimla Accord

                            Everybody knows on the ground who has win and who has lost but by manipulating some sentence here and there we can fool ourselves but not world at large. However, real question is not who has win and who has loss but do we have any interest in becoming civilized society or not. We came out of caves and start living in cities but how far we are from to become civilized societies can be measured from our fascination of war. Our fascination of war brought us in a condition where people are doing robbery of onion and attacking poor to get food. Of course war can make us beggar and reduce the population as compare to poor sanitation and food ban so; we can propagate slave culture again. But why we are so much fascinated to make others slave and in bargain become ourselves, is the real question to answer prior to fascinating for any other war.

                            In my opinion we lost the war completely.War can never be won by technology or equipment.If this is the factor then why Vietnam beat USA(Superpower)? Wars are always won by tactics and passion.In 1965 we got lack of passion compare with Pakistan a small state that time defend Lahore from us.Why our 6 aircraft cant able to destroy the single aircraft of MM Alam or why we are unable to cut the route of sailkot with or 2 division??<br/>
.<br/>
open your mind guys we lost in sense of passion and we win in term of population.
