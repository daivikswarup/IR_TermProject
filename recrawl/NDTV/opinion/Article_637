Headline::::An IIT Teacher's View on the Madras Controversy



DateTime::::2015-05-31T15:32:00+05:30




                                Let's try and take the bull by the horns at the risk of being gored. Here, as far as one can gather, is the narrative so far.
A study circle of students at IIT Madras reads B.R. Ambedkar's classic 'The Annihilation of Caste' and distributes pamphlets that reportedly 'spread hatred' by condemning not just the caste system but all of Hinduism. An anonymous letter to this effect is sent to the HRD Ministry which forwards the complaint to the IIT authorities. IIT Madras then responds by stating that the students have broken an agreed-upon rule that forbids them to use the name of the institution to "garner support or publicize their activities". Finally, the political parties enter the ring like brave matadors - some defending freedom of speech on behalf of the students, and others condemning the apparently wholesale castigation of Hinduism by these same students.
Under these piquant circumstances, how do we interpret that basic 'right to freedom of expression', ironically guaranteed under a Constitution whose chief architect was B.R. Ambedkar himself? In order to address this conundrum, I would like to first turn to a story attributed to a very great champion of Hinduism indeed - Swami Vivekananda.
Vivekananda is said to have prayed fervently at a shrine to the goddess Bhavani in Srinagar. His devotion so pleased Bhavani that she appeared before him and Vivekananda at once agitatedly related to her the desecration of her temple by past 'invaders'. He would never have tolerated such an insult, he tells her; he would have laid down his life to protect her! To all of which the cool goddess replies: "But what if this were indeed the case? What is it to you? Do you protect me or do I protect you?"
Self-deprecating and humour-laden, the anecdote shows how Vivekananda's wise analysis of narrow human enmities still holds lessons for our increasingly cacophonous politics. Taking our cue from it, we might ask: Do our politicians protect the Constitution or does it protect them?
Surely, the latter as much as the former.
Extend this argument now to the students of the Ambedkar Periyar Study Circle. If the political right to protest is sacred, both inside and outside Parliament where so many 'unacceptable' statements have been made of late, then so is the individual right to dissent. And here, we must make a further key distinction, especially relevant to university environments, between the concepts of 'protest' and 'dissent'.
Dissent is not to be confused with protest. We protest about particular issues or events - say, price rise or a horrifying rape - but dissent is not necessarily issue-based. Unlike protest, we can't just 'stop dissenting' in the way we can cease to protest if and when we achieve our objectives. Dissent is not so much protest as the mental foundation of protest; it represents the idiom of anti-complacency and democratic self-voicing. That is why the idea of dissent is key to university environments.
To return to Vivekananda's Goddess here for a moment, we could see her as a potent metaphor for the concepts that a society holds dear - such as democracy or justice or the 'right to dissent'. As this goddess smartly argues, she does not belong by right to any of the sparring parties who appoint themselves her guardians. 'Enshrined' or 'protected' by greater guarantees, she belongs to the transcendent collective - to 'we, the people'.
It is here that the idea of 'the university', in its modern avatar, becomes relevant. In its earliest usage in English, back in 1300, the Shorter Oxford Dictionary informs us that a university indicated "the whole entire number, a community regarded collectively... the whole body of teachers engaged at a particular place, in giving and receiving instruction in the higher branches of learning".
The noun 'Institute', as in the IITs, derives on the other hand from the Latin verb for 'to establish' and has a relatively modern meaning. The first usage of this word was in 1795 in a post-revolutionary France inspired by the ideals of 'liberty, fraternity and equality'. An 'Institute' is supposed to have a more labour and skills-oriented approach to education and an emphasis on technical specializations. According to the Shorter Oxford again, it designates "a society or organization... to promote some literary, scientific, artistic or educational object".
What is noteworthy about both the pre-modern idea of the 'University' and the post-French Revolution notion of the 'Institute' is their collective orientation and their commitment to learning communes where teachers and students are equal partners in intellectual exploration.
A university is ideally a 'protected' place where ideas, however radical, can be fearlessly presented and debated. In this sense, dissent can be seen as an attitude of mind allied to the 'right' to be sceptical and to sharply question. As a teacher, the classroom is my 'sacred space'. My personal opinion is that no question can, in principle, be rejected in such a space. The query or hypothesis a student presents may be wildly off, yet it must be dealt with, as far as possible, through sustained reason and cooperative argument.
Our relentless examination systems and rickety infrastructure may, over the years, have worn down our capacity to enrich this basic idea of 'universal' questioning, but it must be recognized that the 'right' to dissent remains part of the very architecture of a university.
So even if we grant that the students at IIT Madras violated some rules and their privileges had to be 'temporarily withdrawn', a far more fundamental principle seems at stake. That principle has been already articulated by IIT Madras in no uncertain terms: "The Institute does not curtail freedom of expression". Indeed, as a respected site of education, it cannot and must not.
A colleague at IIT Madras makes three sensible points in this connection in an email to me. One, he was out of town when all the brouhaha happened but, truth to tell, he hadn't even heard of this study group until the recent newspaper reports. Two, this controversy somehow reminds him of the quite different 'kiss-of-love' campaign in November 2014 which spilled over into IIT Madras from other campuses with protests outside the campus gates, as in the present case, and then blew over. Three, his 'hunch' is that the incessant media attention these days simply escalates tensions. Overall, his perspective, as an observer at close quarters, is that dissent is such a 'generic' and integral part of campus-life that it would probably pass unnoticed if the media wasn't hyper-ventilating.
To my mind, however, the implications could be larger. Some of the most exciting academic debates in our country in the tumultuous 21st century are likely to come from the struggles of large marginalized aggregates. Unless we are prepared to take these forms of social dissent seriously in academia, the rule-bound, top-down routines to which we have become so used to are bound to be violently disrupted.
As Dalits, women, endangered language groups and others seek to insert their perspectives, texts and theories and into the accepted public discourses and academic canons, we will need to rapidly move outside our mental comfort zones. And this process of 'empowerment' is already well underway.
True, the IIT Madras flashpoint may soon be forgotten but its real significance is that it is yet another wake-up call. Universities and institutes are natural havens where our youth will meet to discuss the excitement, hopes and challenges of the future. If we value that common future, we must protect their freedom to read as they will, to learn, to think and to dissent.(Critical theorist and writer Rukmini Bhaya Nair is a professor at IIT Delhi.

                            Crooked logic or vitanda has no limits. But our intellectuals must understand the motives and motivation for foreigners to create unnecessary debates in India. Now there can be no debate about communism as it is dead and professing to be a Marxist or leftist does not add lustre to anybody's bio data anymore. In fact, one of the surest ways of spreading poverty is propagation of communism in this 21st C. Capitalism has nothing to talk about in the absence of communism. So America is not Devil anymore &amp; neither the USSR the paradise. Wars can't be fought anymore as they were spurred by religion, overtly or covertly. The terrorist barbarity has not affected the world to the same extent as the WW I &amp; II. So now it is charity, philanthropy, disease, drugs, human trafficking, climate, environment, social change and similar other attractive packaging for the foreign hands to take entry into countries like India. Attacking Hindus or what has come to be termed as Hinduism is great business for them because they don't fear reprisal. Had they been afraid as they are of Islam, they would have come to their senses. They have got so frightened by the joke of the decade called gharwapasi that I laugh at it regularly. What has been made of gharwapasi in translation? Re-conversion. So silly. It simply means returning back to your own home. How can somebody cry if someone returns to his home, village, country or roots? We have an age old adage in Subah ka bhoola sham ko ghar aa jaye to use bhoola nahi kahate. Should children running away from home return to their parents or servant to master or wife to husband? IIT campuses should not be allowed to be misused for nefarious activities of mischievous foreign activists under the garb of NGO/Forum/Seminar/conference/Award etc.

                            Freedom of speech gives us immense power but with that comes utmost responsibility. What we say and say not especially in the boundaries of a premier institute should not be misused to prove a point which is against the fabric of our democracy.

                            Good Article. I always wondered, God- the most powerful being ever, needs mere humans to protect him/her? Blasphemy, insult of religion, etc etc, do not the followers of such awesomely powerful beings think?? Does God really need you to protect him?? Lets say i do something against Muslim beliefs, what is the use of blasphemy laws and stuff? Surely your God if he exists, will deal with me when i die?? Similarly for Hindus, Christians etc etc..the list goes on.<br/>
I don't think these people even realise how petty and powerless they are showing their God and Religion to be, if mere Humans are needed to protect His/Her honour.

                            If IIT Madras really allowed DISSENT it should have shot back a letter to HRD ministry and questioned its authority in intervening in its internal matters. By banning the study circle at a wink of the ministry, IIT has proved that it's spineless. Such institutions can never really be places of path breaking research as they lack 'ability to question' in their DNA. ITIs are better than IITs like these

                            Usually these profs are known as Profs of "Hukka" in IITs. Hukka stands for Humanities courses. While I agree they are important for all round development usually these profs suffer from ignominy in an otherwise smart environment. And 99% of these are leftist idiots who couldn't find a job in Universities where Humanities courses are valued. Ask any IITian and they will agree to safely ignore her comments.<br/>
Yes youth's voice is important but young minds are still vulnerable. One cannot support blatant attack on Hinduism. Guess what would have happened if a group did that against Islam.

                            Congratulations Rukmini on turning a very simple matter into a complex argument requiring the distinguishing between the meanings of University and Institution, and requiring reference to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary of the year 1300 and the Latin origins of the word Institute in post revolutionary France of 1795.  Were you not able to somehow make references of this nature, you would be out of a job.  We shall eschew for now comments on the necessity of having the post you hold in the first place anyway.  That said, the characters who make up the Ambedkar-Periyar would be about as far as possible from making the distinction that Rukmini sets out.  They were out to make mischief by using the good name of IIT Madras in their ranting.  IIT Madras must, by necessity be totally neutral in such matters.  This group were at liberty to use their own website/domain, call it what you will.  They were not entitled to use these resources of IIT Madras.  Had it not been for the fuss kicked up by the opposition political parties, nobody would have heard of this group or its views.  It would not surprise me in the least if the anonymous complaint sent to the HDR Ministry was sent by one of the group.  The objective of the group, publicity, was achieved.  How else would this undistinguished group, who, following the brouhaha will remain undistinguished, have come into the public eye? When no less than the Aam Aadmi party which should confine itself to delivering the promised freebies to the Bihari slum dwellers of Delhi, combines with the thugs of the NSUI in Delhi and Professor Rukmini Nayar also in Delhi to support the Ambedkar Periyar group, it is payday for the 20 or so inconsequential students who make up the Madrassi group.

                            Almost 800 years if Islamic rule, 250 years of European rule, both tried to destroy Hindu dharma miserably failed. Now if any body whether it is Ambedkar Periyaar or Mullapperiyaar group could achieve that? Can anybody say there is no cast based discrimination in Christianity or Islam ? Will any upper cast Christian family arrange the marriage of their son or daughter to a lower cast convert? Study how communist leaders of Kerala arranges the marriages of their sons and daughters. One can point out one or two exceptional cases and that does not reflect the mindset of the entire community. While watching the TV debate I have noticed the expressions of hatred flashing on the faces of the so called caste group delegates. No need to protect any dharma, ultimately only truth will survive, what is the need of spreading hatred?

                            This is not about protecting God madam. This is about protecting our socio political identity as Hindus. If the ridicule and misinformation about our religion is not protested or rebutted then we as a group are at risk of being marginalized. The same thing happened to Jews in Europe. Today if an idiot says loudly and repeatedly a blatant lie for long enough then that lie becomes the dominant narrative. Its important to nip such malicious campaigns in the bud.

                            There would be anarchy if we allow all acts of blasphemy under the guise of freedom of speech.  If such acts are allowed then even desecration of holy places under the premise that god will protect himself would be sought to be acceptable.  Author himself confirms that the study circle spread hatred by condemning all of Hinduism.  It is not about god can protect himself or not.  It is about peaceful coexistence.  This act might lead another group to spread hatred about another religion under the guise of freedom of speech.  Every one knows what would be the consequence.  Please respect other religion like you would expect others to do so.  Everything cannot be covered under freedom of speech

                            Does the author think that the French universities are a good model for Indian educational institutes to emulate? Cambridge, Oxford, Max Planck, Harvard, etc., have proven records. The loosey-goosey post-modern approach that the author seems to be fond of, is a certain recipe for disaster. Indian universities are already bogged down by political interference. China, which used to lag behind India in education, is now on the world map. They adhere to a merit based system. It is ironic that a communist country has embraced a merit based education system while a liberal democracy is squandering away the opportunity to train and harness the huge pool of aspirational youth. History will not forgive the misguided thinkers of India who are masquerading as intellectuals.

                            The authoress has tried to distinguish an "University" from an "Institute" but, she has succeeded only in half a measure. A "University" in its protected environment in an ideal situation must allow all sorts of discussions to take place freely retaining what is original and good for Mankind and rejecting the bad. That is how original thinkers and philosophers are born. And such debates usually will cover all subjects ranging from the Arts to Zoology. And, in an 'University" ideas and thoughts which it had rejected earlier can always be revived and adopted again if times have changed. But, in an "Institute"  the teaching and learning is usually very specific to a subject/field. Example: a Medical Institute confines it self to the study and research in the field of medicine or in this case an Institute specifically meant for Engineering and Technology. Of Course, within this space, freedom to openly discuss and debate including dissent should be integral part of that Institute but  nothing beyond. The point I am trying to make is this: These students who joined IIT Madras presumably joined with a very specific objective of becoming engineers, technocrats etc. If they formed a "Study" group then presumably it was to discuss/debate/dissent on subjects of their choosing at the IIT. They had no business to have political discussions in their 'study' group and criticize on community or another. If they wanted to take part in political debates and discussions then they should quit IIT, take course in political science if they feel like it, and join a political party or start one and then use the 'freedom of expression' guaranteed under the Constitution to criticize anyone they wish to. But, get out of IIT course first.

                            I did not understand most of the mumbo jumbo of the good professor. Frankly, I was trying to distill her verbose commentary down to what is her basic position. Here is a simple question. If a Hindu student had criticized and used the same language for Islam, Christianity, or Dalits, how many of these professors would defend the student's right? None. This sheer hypocrisy and prejudice is what people find offensive and therefore these critical theorists(?) get no traction. The good professor has to learn some simple honesty first.

                            If the group says that they will destroy Hinduism or for that matter any other religion could lead to law and order problem. It is definitely not a freedom of speech issue. Some other group then says they will destroy another community and it escalates into a civil war. But banning the group by saying that they violated the rules, instead of that they should have been banned, booked and arrested for trying to create hatred between different sections of society.

                            God has created us to protect our tradition, culture, heritage! ur crooked vivekanda story picking up from basket can not make any sense as if we cant protect our dharma, why God shud come, will HE or SHE not ask us , what duty we have observed before asking help from HIM/ HER? remember, u can make example for other religion but hinduism does not depend on any story or any human or any great human preaching! its a concept which all shud protect because if we protect it, automatically our freedom of religion, freedom of speech also to be protected, so don't kill the base! its all about saving/ protecting the foundation on which u r standing, and u Ms, u r writing, enjoying freedom here because of hinduism!

                            The issue here is that the same group which vociferously demanding freedom of expression is not ready for my freedo of exression.I feel it is Ambedkar who is responsible for the modern day mess of India.If caste sysytem is continuing it is thanks to the reservation ploicy enforced by him which was supposed to be for 10 years has now become a sort of Rigt for these groups.Why should I suffer for some inustice ceated by our ancestors?If the reservation logic is applied than all that hindus have suffered during Muslim and English rules should be compensated for theitr sufferings.This double talk is the issue.Don't forget that these people are enjoying at my expense as their fees are subsidised by y paying taxes and that too witout they being meritorious students as they have been admitted by reservation policy for being bacwar.Same thig is true about Muslims and Christianity.Let me have the freedom to express myself by sayng thae same thing that if in the world some religion need to be detroyed it is these two.Look at the world and ISIS.Now don't lecture me that they are not muslims.These idiots are becoming murderer even at a cartoon.And I am damn sure there are those blind Ambedkar Bhakts who will spring into a foul language cooments and eassays after my comment.So freedom of expression has to be for all and not only for those mean minded group only.If you have so much self respect just come out of reservation couch.Can you do that? No I am sure.That proves your mental abilities.Even a beggar is better than that IIT-M group

                            Leave alone I I Ts. The one campus which can not deviate from studies has been disturbed by a nonsensical group of people. Their activities always create divisions and conflicts. Caste oriented differences can turn ugly.Let them have such studies outside the campuses. Political parties should not politicize educational institutions and spoil them. Government should not give in to this demand which has exterior motives.

                            The primary aim of students is to "study": not indulge in politics. Such students as belong to the Ambedkar- Periyar study circle will not be able to answer basic questions on the Constitution of which Ambedkar was the chief architect. They are more concerned with preserving their reserved status granted under the Constitution as a temporary measure but perpetuated by successive Governments for vote bank purposes, rather than studying. They know they can waste their time, score 50% marks and still get a reserved quota job. Isn't this as bad as the caste system?

                            Honestly a serious student at IIT is the last person to indulge in such activities. It also damages the reputation of IIT Madras as India's Stanford because freedom of speech claim is for low IQ purile irrelevant kind of activism and learned professional is needlessly giving intellectual spin.I am reminded of Kalidas famous shastrarth with his wife and Pandits(read media and committed intellectuals in today's context)<br/>
gave a learned interpretation<br/>
Hindu philosophy has great capacity for intellectual dissent so much so that 6 out of 10 systems are atheist<br/>
and charvak preached extreme materialism.<br/>
IIT should live up to its name.Its students should have hallmark of superintellect and ideas.For instance when Aadi Shankaracharya asked the house of Mandan Misr in Kaashi he was told that even parrot recites sloka from veda is the house<br/>
  These students who managed to enter the portals of IIT must be given another screening whether they have adequate mind power and minimum intellect to remain at IIT otherwise they should not be allowed to put the great institution in news for the wrong reasons!

                            It is good that such an incident has happened in the IIT. Tamil Nadu politics is floundering in the absence of good leaders. On the one hand, Jayalalithaa has managed to scrape back to power on the back of a dubious court decision. On the other hand, you have the corrupt and nepotical DMK who has no great ideas themselves, save making themselves and their kin rich. Besides the Brahminical fascist forces are raising their ugly head everywhere. Especially with the Brahminical forces ruling the country, though headed by a non Brahmin Prime Minister with a larger than life image, such debates are healthy for a democracy. Or else the fascist right wing forces will take the initiative away from the forward thinking groups. Especially when you consider that the Congress does not seem to have learnt their lesson from their debacle. They still want to cling to Rahul Gandhi and the rest of the Gandhi family to provide them with leadership and ideas.

These same politicians will become 'pussy cats' if it comes to criticising Islamic and Christian societies.Media has distorted the issue and blown out of proportions for improving their TRP ratings.

                            I went through the entire passage to find out where I can make some agreement with this author. Yes, "Universities and institutes are natural havens where our youth will meet to discuss the excitement, hopes and challenges of the future". - as long as their controversial or otherwise, discussion is restricted within their hostel mess or indoors of their rooms. Universities are primarily meant for education. IIT Madras used to be one of the finest institutions.

                            Very profound but what did she want to say. World over criticism of Govt and prominent people is the peoples birthright but by banning the bigger picture is that many people and organization will now see criticism as "dangerous" and refrain from voicing their opinions. More harm has been done by IIT BY THEIR BAN ORDER for general public than to students of the group who started it. We cannot progress to world leaders if we do not have the freedom and it is all rubbish to state that the pamphlet spread hatred. One can read hatred in Beef Ban also but that is incorrect analysis.

They are here to create differences and degrade the campuses.

                            This is just a sophisticated version of the articles written by our pseudo-seculars. You can never stop wondering how many of these pseudo-seculars love to preach Hindus/Hinduism about secularism, dissent, peace, equality and what not. The author is essentially doing the usual secularists job except for some loaded terms from academic social studies. She could not say any word about how such so called marginilized sections are deliberately made to feel margenalized, agitated through want is called "atrocity literature" and a very consicrated effort by the previous establishments whether it is the british raj, or the previous governments since indepence. Ramchandra Guha (though himself is a pseudo-secualrist) lamented/unwittingly revealed during a debate on NDTV about appointment of ICHR chairman that the previous "eminent historians" have acted with a leftist ideology and coerced discourse. All schemes and discourse so far in this country has been to divide the Hindu society further.

                            I wonder why this study group needed first of all in places like IIT.i thought students who come there are with big dreams of becoming intellectuals,technocrats, scientists. I can't imagine students indulging non-scientific activities . Why not name a study group in the name of Richard Feymann, or Albert Einstein or Chandrashekhar ?? Instead students use Ambedkar or zzz. How crazy it is. There itself I see a problem. If these study group does not adhere to the rules and regulations of the institute, straight away ban them. I would also like to know the academic performance of the members of these study groups. That data will be interesting to see.

                            I turned to this article thinking that I get to see a "unbiased view" of the situation but very disappointed. Really surprised for not seeing anyone coming to the support of the actual institution that caught in the centre of all this media hyped drama. Just to start with am not any BAKTH or PAPPU's gaurd or jaadu wale. Why no one is noticing that the IIT management only temporarily barred the group from using the Institutions resources, what is wrong in that. Did they ban the students from the Uni? If it not for the involvement of political parties and media hype this issue could have been solved with in the campus walls and no one would have noticed. NO ONE should loose their right to freedom of speech but the biggest mistake of the group may be putting the quotes from Dr.Ambedkar and also their views on the MODI gvt in the same paper. Again, the opinions expressed in this post are purely my personal opinion and if I am CEO of MNC this will have a lot of weight.

                            Progress is possible only when there is peace and harmony.  Anything that disturbs this peace and harmony should be considered as enemical to the country.  Freedom of speech or thinking should not be used as excuse for the distarbance.  What Ambedkar said at one time cannot be held against him for ever.  Most probably he would have changed his judgement now.  We talk of Vivekananda.  His life was one of evolution.  He expressed many ideas from the young age when he was wayward to the age when he matured and then started evolving.  What he said before meeting Shri Ramakrishna cannot be quoted to justify drunkuness.  Krishna in early childhood was impish but as he evolved, he became a diplomat, psychiatrist and finally the theories of Bhagwadgeetha.  Can we quote Krishna to justify theft!  Nobdoy lives in photo frame.

                            As someone who spent 41 years in IIT Kharagpur, 4+1 as a student, and 36 years as a faculty member (1956 to 1997), I am dismayed by this controversy. I do not want to get into a debate on Hinduism or the caste system as that should not be the focal point of my comments. Although the IITs have remained beyond the shadow of the political parties for all these decades, one must not jump to a conclusion that the IIT students were isolated from every thought process. <br/>
Please note that because the IIT system was not 'infected' by the 'professional politicians' IIT Kharagpur was the only Institute in West Bengal that continued its academic activities without any major disruption.<br/>
We had the Technology Students Gymkhana constituted by elected (no foothold was given to any political party) representative of the Student Body who were responsible for organizing Cultural, Literary, and Sports activities. The Bengali, English, and Hindi debating societies both at the Institute level as well as at the Hall of Residence level, were lively venues for intellectual expression.  Same was the case for the various Dramatic societies. <br/>
We had some informal groups of faculty and students from a particular State, but they organized cultural get-together where all others were invited and exposed to their rich culture and delicacies. In no case they stood for any narrow sectarian view.<br/>
The Institute did not, repeat DID NOT, have any "Group" representing a narrow sub-group of any hue. All debating fora were open to everyone -- students as well as the faculty and staff -- so no ground was given to any narrow group to propagate their views as those of the IIT student body. I feel that the initial mistake of IIT Madras was to recognize such groups -- may be the decision was influenced by the political ambiance in that State. I strongly feel that none of the IITs should give official recognition to any sectarian group of any hue -- left, right, or center. Pray leave these hallowed Institutes alone -- as it is the average student and faculty member has plenty on his plate. Please let them aim to excel in peace.

                            What the fringe "club" of IIT in the name of "Ambedkar &amp; Periyaar Club" is a clear violation of Freedom of Speech as they were FULLY DIRECTED against a particular Religion/Caste.  It is also a fact that while Dr. Ambedkar was definitely a UNIFYING force, on the contrary PERIYAAR was a DIVISIVE FORCE, and that is why he is never a National Leader.  Almost ALL Periyaar's notes were HATE SPEECH.  It is perverted design by the FRINGE CLUB to use the name of Dr. Ambedkar, while their clear intent was to propagate "HATE SPEECH" of PERIYAAR.  In fact PERIYAAR talked bad about GODS OF ALL RELIGION, but this FRINGE CLUB is against one PARTICULAR RELIGION/CASTE and they do not have the GUTS even to FULLY TALK WHAT PERIYAAR TALKED and that is their perverted cunningness.  It is  a fact that successive governments in State (Tamil Nadu) and centre have made their might  to quell any HATE SPEECH, but this group is hiding under the garb of 'FREEDOM OF SPEECH", which is a distortion.<br/><br/>
Will this FRINGE CLUB, by the same FREEDOM OF SPEECH accept to apply the same yardstick to those talks  of similar FRINGEs in SANGH PARIVAR who few times make HATE SPEECH?  Will any man with common sense and integrity with India accept the FREEDOM OF SPEECH formula to both the FRINGE IIT CLUB as equal to SANGH PARIVAR fringes?  <br/><br/>
The FRINGE CLUB IF ITT has abused the noble name of Dr. Ambedkar to revive the hate policies of PERIYAAR.  People should also remember that the JUSTICE PARTY (which later became Dravidian Party) requested the British Monarch to retain Chennai Presidency under their DIRECT RULE even if they give FREEDOM TO INDIA.  Will this Fringe Club of IIT accept this anti-national stance of PERIYAAR Group, by way of FREEDOM OF SPEECH?<br/><br/>
Do not divide societies CURRENT INDIAN SOCIETY that has matured and practice tolerance to the greatest extent.  Do not provoke any Religion/Caste.   Do not abuse the name of tall and noble leaders of INDIA, such as Dr. Ambdkar, remembering that the family that adapted and supported Dr. Ambdkar itself was a BRAHMIN family, and as a mark of respect he adapted the family name AMBEDKAR in his own name.  Such was his gratitude and that makes him the Noblest.  <br/><br/>
It is unfortunate that national parties such as CONGRESS, in the dream of attacking the current Government, has led itself into a web of contradictions.  All such political parties are certainly to face more embarrassing moments on FREEDOM OF SPEECH unless they desist such impulsive reactions.<br/><br/>
Short and sweet;  Dr. Ambdkar was a noble positive unifying leader while Periyaar was a divisive force, that Tamil Nadu has condemned and forgot, and walked out.  <br/><br/>
Jai Hind.  Equality for all Indian.  Condemn the convenient application of FREEDOM OF SPEECH.....Societies should come together to expose the heinous design of these FRINGE CLUBS

We object because these qualify as hatred and against someone else believe.

Ambedkar never took up issues of muslims, nor is his book related to islam, neither the IITM study group has anything to do with islam and muslims.

Getting their ward attention diverted from Studies is no any parent would like to happen; especially the group is trying to influence others by distributing pamphlets etc. This is not acceptable; Any such discussions about politics and religion should be out of Campus.

                            There are only 3 issues involved:<br/><br/>
1. Did the Ambedkar-Periyar Group misrepresent facts to give the impression that they represent IIT Madras in some form? It appears so.<br/><br/>
2. Did they hurt the sentiments of a section of society to a point where there was the risk of law and order problems? I'm not sure, but surely they took the chance.<br/><br/>
3. Do they have a right to express their views, even if it is opposed to the Govt or the University? Surely, Yes.<br/><br/>
An important point worth pondering is, how could IIT have handled it? IIT could have given a notice to the Group, and said they would lose their privileges if they don't give a convincing reply. By engaging them in writing, either they could have get them to mellow down, or get them to commit themselves to a point where legal action would have clearly been in IIT's favour.

                            Humanities as subjects must be removed from IIT's....they can be taken to a seperate campus under the great old Nalanda University....this Madras IIT episode proves that the establishment of the humanities departments were with an aim to penetrate IIT s and foment trouble at some point....dont ask why ????

                            Brilliant article. Only very few self-styled 'guardians' of faith (as if they protect faith and not vice-versa) take exception to ideologies which are against theirs. Having said that the notion of oppose but not hate, agitate but not-violently, condemn but with gentleness, etc,. are virtues which are to be up-held by stalwarts out of IITs. The institution could have resolved this amicably by requesting the group to tone down their language. As simple as it is.

                            Simply reply to professor, do not encourage bigotry,nor a closed mind, under the disguise of Freedom. Freedom of Speech comes with responsibility. This issue that warranted a long article can be explained in a simple manner. <br/><br/>
No one has the right to seek destruction of any belief system. Second, if you are part of an institution that is using taxpayer money, and is regulated by rules, you do not exploit them just because you are a Hindu Dalit or whatever.<br/><br/>
I dont blame the students as much I blame the faculty that is advising kids to be rebels and challenge the norms of society. Yes, to protest and to be argumentative is one's right, but it has to be within the law. It was rightly asked, what would have been the response if Islam's practice of killing apostate was asked to be destroyed, then the article i read would have been different.<br/><br/>
Now as far as HRD is concerned, clearly the act of misguided students influenced by leftist+Communist+Anarchist brigade of professors is to blame.<br/><br/>
The pamphlet that was circulated clearly asked for destruction of Hindu culture/belief system of as Roman church refers to it as religion. Who in their right mind will speak on behalf of this or even try to protect it?HRD received a complaint, they forwarded to IIT and IIT looked into their rule book and took action. The rest can best be described as howling of red wolves.<br/><br/>
Teach and educate students, dont make them anarchists. Its our taxpyer money and they are our children

                            100 marks for this lengthy write up but far from logical. Its better for the future of students to concentrate on studies and not especially on religion and politics. Their time in IIT will be over before they realize they don't have enough time to concentrate on their core studies. <br/><br/>
Moreover our people are very emotional and politicians are very crooked to take advantage of every small issue. We can allow universities modelling around your thoughts when as a country we become more developed both emotionally and morally. <br/><br/>

                            Ramakrishna, the guru of your Swami Vivekananda said "if you work under anybody for more than 12 years, you become slave to them" (his teachings). Seems you have become slave to dynasty indirectly by working under the government ran for more than decades indirectly by the dynasty. <br/>
While "freedom of expression" is undeniable, no group has right to use public resources to preach their doctorine. <br/>
If these so called rationalist are real great Aristotle/Plato/Einstein/Newtons of India, they could have created true economic theories with validations to challenge so called Modi Model.That could have won admiration.For these south Indian groups, it is easy to beat Dead snake of Hinduism rather than think ingenious ideas to prove their point. <br/>
From the way anti-Hindu slogan is raised, one can't discount indirect hands of dynasty as well.

Students with a passion for science, research &amp; engg  doing such things?? if there is dissent, then these are intelligent students, they are supposed to debate &amp; discuss with the concerned authorities. If intellectuals start behaving in this manner, what is the future for this country ? writing ill about Hinduism is not going to help their development in anyway....if possible try and understand Hinduism first....

                            I pay my taxes to the govt which funds IIT students. I have a right to expect that IIT distinguishes itself in academic and scientific/ engg research. I do not expect students to use their time in campus working on other things.. Sure, they have a right to their opinion and voice it but let them not use the IIT as a platform for it. Whether any group is pro or anti government is besides the point. We have sent them to learn and contribute.. As it is almost every one of them studies on our money and goes abroad thereby leaving our nation impoverished. Let them do what they are sent for. If they graduate and once they earn their own money let them come out and voice all these opinions in a different forum, we will then hear them.. Their is another sinister agenda too. Being a part of groups ensure that faculty will find it difficult to fail you/ give you low grades.

                            If a student cannot ask a question or share his view within a educational compound, where else would he/she go ? If he/she wants to challenge any norm -be it religion or god himself or democracy or constitution... They should be allowed to do so.  The teachers, other students should be able to swing the views of these people by debates and discussions. <br/><br/>
1. IITM management should have responded to HRD saying, the institution encourages debates and different view points. including those that are rare and completely off the track. <br/>
2. They should have replied saying the institution has rules, if and when crossed by a student or others in sharing their views will be dealt with.<br/>
3. IITM management should have then called the people/groups who have shared their view and reviewed the details. Then decided, what should have been done.<br/><br/>
Just to please the HRD, taking an action under a rule not relevant to the current issue, is clearly an appeasement by IITM management.

                            This verbose article by Rukmini B. Nair states a lot but conveys little. I would like to raise some points on this whole episode.<br/>
1)	When a student enters a University or Institute for further studies, does he/she not agree to play by certain agreed rules and regulations of the said educational "body"?  If these rules are violated by the students, then does this violation constitute "freedom of expression" and is not the "body" within its right to ban such violation? In this instance, the IIT Madras has apparently taken exception not because of the contents of the pamphlets but only temporarily banned the said group for violation of the agreed rules, that such groups do not use the name of the Institute for their activities, anonymous letters or not. In what way is the IIT wrong on this?<br/><br/>
2)	If the pamphlets contain material that is condemning a particular religion in general (in this case "Hinduism"} and hurting the sentiments of its followers, in addition to and not limited to censoring certain decadent social practices associated with it (in this case casteism), then is this  not "spreading hatred" against the religion and is spreading such hatred permitted in the Constitution? Would not the so called secularists make a hue and cry had this condemnation been on Islam and Christianity in general?<br/>
It is one thing to discuss, argue, agree or dissent etc. in Universities but it is another thing to vilify and spread hatred.

Don't politicize an educational institute and distract the students from their main reason of getting enrolled in this great institution!
