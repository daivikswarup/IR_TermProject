Headline::::Mamata, Touching Investors' Feet is Not the Answer 



DateTime::::2015-01-10T17:58:00+05:30



(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)From holding hands with so-called Maoists to disrupting industrial projects to touching the feet of industrialists to invest in Bengal, Mamata Banerjee has reached new heights in the politics of double speak.  At the recent industrialists' meet in Bengal, in the face of scepticism, she actually apologized for the past but then realizing the political consequences of such regret, the Chief Minister changed tack, as is her wont and blamed the previous Left Government for the problems regarding industry. She has much to apologise for. Between 2004-2005 and 2011-2012, West Bengal under the Left regime led the country in the creation of new jobs in manufacturing. According to NSSO Statewise data, in all, 51.3 lakh manufacturing jobs were created in India during that period of which Bengal created 27.4 lakh manufacturing jobs placing the State first, as against Gujarat which was in second place with 9.5 lakh jobs. But the job creation situation has now been reversed to job loss which is why there are not many who would take her words seriously.  In the last three years, around 90 industrial units have shut down in Bengal including jute mills, tea gardens, engineering units and even IT companies, making over one lakh workers jobless. Among the units shut down are Shalimar Paints, Jessop, the well-known firm which had built the second Hooghly bridge under the Left Government, Birla's Hindustan Motors. Dunlop closed down in 2012 and Nokia-Siemens closed down its Kolkata unit. Production in the Haldia Chemical plant was seriously affected last year with a cascading impact on auxiliary units. In fact industrial belts in Bengal whether in the Asansol-Durgapur belt, the Barrackpore area, or in and around Haldia have become a virtual no man's land for industry.  The reasons are not hard to find. Why should industry invest in a State where extortion and blackmail are constant toxic pollutants and where the police, functioning directly under the Chief Minister, are rewarded for saving ruling party criminals involved in such cases?  In 2013, there were numerous incidents of clashes between TMC-run syndicates competing in extortionist practices. The TMC MLA in Durgapur wrote to the police against threats being received by small-scale industrialists in the Durgapur industrial area by TMC trade union leaders led by its Vice President. In the same month of July, a well-known steel manufacturer in the Asansol belt complained to the police of TMC leaders demanding a commission. Last year, the MLA of Singur made headlines with his statement that "Mamata Banerjee is claiming that her party won't be involved in extortion. But party workers are extorting money before my very eyes."  The context is the violence unleashed by the TMC under the patronage of its top leaders on its political opponents using the services of goondas. If the Chief Minister openly defends an MP who threatens to get women of the CPI(M) raped by his goondas, the message sent out is pretty unambiguous-anything goes so long as TMC hegemony is established. But once the genie of criminalisation of politics is unleashed, it does not end there, and the license to violence against political opponents is also used as a license for self-aggrandizement through corruption and extortion. Industry is an easily identifiable target by the syndicates run by the ruling regime. This is hardly a conducive environment for investment. Secondly, the Chief Minister's double standards as far as making land available to industry is concerned was reflected in her plea to industry to buy the land themselves which will be "facilitated" by the Government. She says her Government cannot do it directly due to "political compulsions." Everyone knows her political compulsions are of her own making. This is an open invitation to land dealers and middlemen under TMC patronage to get land from peasants. If there is extortion in industrial areas, one can imagine what will happen in rural areas where TMC gangs, in the name of "facilitation", will ride roughshod over the right of farmers  to consent to sell or not sell their land. In fact, in Singur over 90 per cent of farmers had given their consent to sell their land for the Nano plant. But Mamata's "political compulsions" helped Gujarat to get the car plant and the Singur farmers to suffer. Another critical aspect is that of industrial relations. Bengal's Finance Minister boasted that  the state had seen the lowest number of man days lost in industrial actions. In fact, the refusal of Government to intervene in cases of injustice to workers led to industrial unrest in the two major industries of tea and jute. Strong unity among trade unions regardless of political affiliations culminated in successful industrial actions. The Mamata Government has displayed aggressive hostility to genuine trade union movements. She has openly threatened workers with stringent punishment if they go on legally-sanctioned actions. Instead, she has backed her own party men in their violent assaults on workers in trade unions opposed to her Government. On such a basis of contempt and hostility for workers' rights, industrial development can never be sustained.  The Government and ruling party leaders are in the eye of the Saradha storm with the investigations by the Enforcement Directorate as well as the court-ordered CBI investigation closing in on one top leader of the TMC after another. In the light of statements made by jailed TMC leaders, the demand for the interrogation of the Chief Minister has gained momentum. Bengal is abuzz with the speculation of where the buck will stop. Investor summits for Bengal have seen many venues under the TMC shift from Kolkata to Mumbai to Singapore and back to Kolkata. But it will need much more than a change of venue and the touching of corporate feet to bring jobs back to Bengal.

                            Really heart breaking and shameless for the governments.<br/>
What the hell they are doing for the people, they do beg for the votes, and <br/>
even fall on the begger's feets for votes.<br/>
Once they get the power, they behave like great giants.<br/>
Telangana govt must address this. This is really a terrible situation.<br/>
Really the both TDP and TRS govts are giving more time  to scolding each other but none of them are doing work for the farmers. being given many promises of loan waiver, support to the farmers.<br/>
Even Kavitha gets time to question the sovereignity of the country but, what she will till about this kind of incidents.

                            The divide between the have and the have nots is widening uncontrollably. There are some people living in million dollar mansions and some living inside pipes or under bridges. It is sad  considering we all pass this way only once. This quote rings so true: I grumbled because I had aching feet, until I saw a man with no legs. If only there was no income inequality, everyone could enjoy the spoils of this earth equally and not just a select few.

                            Thanks NDTV for posting this article . I read many people have sent money for this family , and some people want to help her for long term as well. That's really kind. I feel NDTV should provide details for other farmer's family as well who are in so much need . So we can help as much as possible . If one person takes responsibility to send at least 1000 rs per month to one of the family , it would be very helpful for them. We eat MC Donald's burger , drink star bucks coffees ..we are definitely capable to help people who are in need .<br/>
My request is to NDTV to provide details for other farmers as well who in trouble .

                            Thank you, NDTV, for sharing their story and info on how readers can help. Is there any way this could be an on going section? You reporters must come across so many such stories. There are lots of readers who want to help and plenty of people who need help - in fact, you mention here that there were 30 suicides in June in this region alone. It would be a noble cause to pursue for your organization.

Telangana people had a option in 2014 elections to elect the best party which is LOKSATTA but still people can not recognize it and they elect only the parties which divide people by cast, poor, rich, religion and region...I have transferred 10,000 rupees but still I am not feeling happy because there are 30 more families having same story..India will not change until we change...

                            This is painful... not for the person who died but the survivors. Hence it is a dastardly, coward act! Suicide can never be an option. I am sorry but that is easy way out. Is the poor surviving girl better or worse after the death? Of course that doesnt take away the blame from the authorities but thats a pathetic reality everywhere in India (the political class as it is.<br/>
Still with due respect, suicide is NO OPTION.

May be we are a nation of selfish people who care little for the poor and the needy. Europe and US have a huge network of private and church-based charities helping people in distress. Rather than blaming the Government of cursing once fate, we should involve more in organised charity works to help millions of Swapnas. May God help her to achieve her goal in life.

But in our country, it is like what Rajni Kanth says in "sivaji", "RICH BECOMES RICH AND POOR BECOMES POOR". With new techniques like drip irrigation as well as river interlinking, we could have fed our poor more better. And because of the population burst, illegal migrants, improper APL/BPL division,  corruption, short sighted politicians, every penny is shared by 100+ crore people.

State Govt: solving water problems to a state is not an easy task as water board is with Central water sharing. It will take 2-3 years to have enough water for the region<br/><br/>

                            Thanks Uma Sudhir. Feel really sad for the family but there are many such stories.. Be sure that Politics will not help much since our leaders/bureaucrats will not change overnight since it did not happen in last 6 decades. Only thing we as responsible citizens (who can afford to little bit at least)is to contribute whatever little we could. See the beauty, Uma did her duty as a responsible journalist and many and many from around the globe are responding in kind. This will only save the country. May god bless their family. May the local government also come to aid the farmers to add strength. I trfd some and will continue to do.

                            The story brought tears to my eyes. Here I am in a cosy air conditioned room typing away whilst there exists a family for whom the utter basics of life seems a luxury. What a shame that this also happens to be the family of a man who attempted to feed the world as an occupation!<br/>
I have done what I consider a moral duty by making a NEFT donation, but I also request NDTV to, in future, give us some other means of reaching out to the family so we can work out a longer term solution.<br/>
If we ditch the politicians and help each other out, India will really be shining some day!

                            After putting this like a news item, you are putting a disclaimer saying that you have not verified anything. Now how the hell do you expect individual people to verify while you with all your resources are not able to do the same? This disclaimer will only put off people who want to donate to genuine causes but do not have the resources to do the verification of the same

Please bring out such stories so that people who want to help can actually help. Remember, media was born initially to serve the people. Somewhere down the line it has become a business. I am not against media trying to get profit/money, but please do not forget the humanity element.

                            Farmer suicides are seem to be going to be a common event these days. Now govt salaries are increasing at ''double in 5 years''. Naturally wages and charges and production expenses also will increase proportionally. Govt can find money in treasuries or else can mint money. But poor farmers can not make money that easy. So farmers are compelled to take loans from banks or other sources and if the crop fails due to some national calamities like flood, drought, cyclones etc..then his future will be doomed. Govt should arrange to give full compensation in such cases. This will be more democratic than the present practice of giving DA rises to govt employees only at 7% to 10% every 6 months, in the name of compensation for price rise which is actually due to the DA rise&amp; resulting wage rise.

                            This is where we let down farmers. Farmers in turn should not invest in huge scale in cultivating cash crops, rather should focus on crop rotation, and go for more short term veggies, and others. If banks/insurance companies can form a consortium for group of farmers in a area, there will be technical advise and guidance to all the farmers, and in case of any eventually like crop failure or monsoon havoc the loss would be minimal. We should go for group farming with, ideal farm land possessing all the links like cattle, coconut or palm on the boundaries, poultry, piggery, gobar gas plant, etc. Dependent on one source breaks the hope of a farmer

                            This is indeed a story of struggle and one must hand it out this gritty girl for persevering. Unfortunately this is the story of millions of farmers and their families in this country. The average farmer owns small holdings and is dependant on the rain gods for a good crop. Then he is at the mercy of commission agents who would have lent him money. And thus the vicious circle continues. He cannot depend on water from government irrigation projects because these projects are constructed and located at the whims and fancies of the political class. The government only pays lip service to the plight of farmers, his tragedy continues.
