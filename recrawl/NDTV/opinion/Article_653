Headline::::Amit Shah Needs to Unlearn a Few Tricks Before Bihar Elections



DateTime::::2015-06-13T15:47:00+05:30




                                Ever since Arvind Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party assumed power in Delhi, the city is being stifled by a battle of vindictiveness and arrogance. The BJP, which leads the central government, seems to have taken its defeat in the assembly election a little too personally. So, on a daily basis, there is a headline on a new battle between the Central and Delhi governments over authority and control.
The latest was the arrest of Delhi Law Minister Jitender Singh Tomar for allegedly forging and providing fake degrees. The charges against Tomar are serious. Serious enough for Arvind Kejriwal to not just ask him to resign as minister but also take disciplinary action against him. However, the manner in which Tomar was arrested, with even the Delhi Commissioner of Police caught unawares, smells of vindictiveness.
In the second week of May, the Bar Council of Delhi had filed a complaint against Tomar, asking the Delhi Police to look into the authenticity of the certificates submitted by him. The council had given Tomar a "last opportunity" to submit original graduation certificates and law degree by May 27. Tomar's advocate had sought time till July to file the certificates, but the council declined his request.
On May 27, Arvind Kejriwal made scathing allegations against the Centre, stating that Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung had been conferred with special powers by the Central government to allow for a dictatorship in Delhi. Days later, in an unprecedented move, Tomar was arrested by the Delhi Police with most in the Ministry of Home Affairs and establishment caught unawares.
None of us can be in a position to condemn any legal action against Tomar should the case against him be proved, but unfortunately for the BJP, there are too many episodes of power tussle between the L-G, supported by the BJP, and Arvind Kejriwal, to suggest that the arrest was made in the spirit of justice. And this arrogance is slowly and steadily making the BJP take disastrous decisions which could well see it being routed in the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar and West Bengal.
The BJP's political miscalculations began with BJP president Amit Shah appointing former top cop Kiran Bedi as the party's chief ministerial candidate in Delhi. The most important criterion for her selection was her rivalry with Kejriwal and several deserving candidates from the BJP were ignored, including Harsh Vardhan, who had, in the previous Delhi election, improved the tally of the party substantially.
Here again, Shah, whose politics of manipulation and vindictiveness in Gujarat is legendary, chose shrewd games over capability.
He has attempted games with Mamata Banerjee and her ministers in West Bengal too.
In December last year, the Trinamool Congress had alleged that the BJP and Amit Shah were being vindictive against her ministers. The party alleged that Shah - who had promised to drown Mamata Banerjee and her party in the Gangasagar in the assembly election - was the mastermind behind the arrest of her ministers in the Saradha scam. The Trinamool also alleged that Shah was behind the allegations of Mamata Banerjee's involvement in the scam.
However, just a month ago, Prime Minister Narenda Modi shared the stage with Mamata, heaping praise on her and her government, suggesting a turnaround in attitude.
Playing games could well backfire for the BJP in the forthcoming Bihar elections. It is a known fact that former Bihar Chief Minister Jitin Ram Manjhi's rebellion against his then party, the Janata Dal (United) and the subsequent floor test he had to face was a result of the political manoeuvering orchestrated by Amit Shah and Ram Vilas Paswan. According to insiders, Shah and Modi have made Bihar a prestige battle, given Nitish Kumar's open criticism of Modi before the Lok Sabha election last year.
Amit Shah, who has been huddled in Patna with senior party functionaries, must have realised by now that it was the politics of antagonism which led to a consensus between sworn enemies Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad in Bihar.
That Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was able to placate the two warring leaders was a result of an anti-Modi card thrown at the two, suggesting that should they not unite, the BJP could use its power at the Centre to rake up old cases against them.
Manoeuvering is not new to politics. It's an art used by every political party to assume power. But Amit Shah, for whom Bihar will be a test to retain his post as BJP president, must realise that he has moved on from Gujarat. That he is now the president of a national party. And that, a position like his demands more gravitas than vengeful political arrests like Jitender Tomar's and the constant shadow-boxing through the L-G with Kejriwal suggest.
While the case against Tomar is grave and demands arrest and investigation, the manner of his arrest has given AAP another chance at claiming martyrdom at the hands of political parties, mostly the BJP, which has been very amateurish in accepting its defeat in the state.
Amit Shah needs to realise that Bihar will require political deftness and not grudge-bearing, revengeful games with his opponents, who have burnt their fingers in the past with similar games and are in a much more superior position to get an upper hand in the state.
Perhaps, it is time for Amit bhai to unlearn a few tricks.(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer.

                            Fail to understand writer's logic. She want to criticize Modi for everything, even if the arrest is legal and constitutional. Her problem is with "manner of arrest". Tell me are there any standards to arrest a person who has commited crime. The writer has hatred for Modi Govt, which is reflecting in her article.

Should we call such writing an expression of frustration of "Internet Psuedo seculars" on Modi's victory secured through a positive campaign centered on development. Such drivel is not worth the bytes that are spent on creating it.

Meanwhile, how is your thesis on the "attacks on the churches by the right wing" going? And please don't forget to discuss the seriousness of the issue with Sagarika Ghose. If possible carry a Louis Vuitton shawl for her. She would be incredibly happy. She has been asking for that from Rajdeep Sar"dard"esai for long but he has not yet obliged.

                            In Delhi, AK is more to blame if we look at the kind of issues he picked up. He is no stranger to controversies. In Delhi multiple things went wrong starting from deferring elections. Delhi being Delhi, I suppose Amit Shah did not have free hand. Nitish Kumar joined back with Lalu due to cold math on one hand and his discomfort of being CM when Modi is PM. Mamata Banerji had no such issues. Nitish Kumar has emerged weaker and any success he may get will be at the mercy of Lalu.

                            Well written article Rana. I think your article also exposes how major political parties are using the constitutional authority to dismantle federalism and encourage hatred from the state governments. Competition is good and has to be displayed by the central govt as well. It should let the delhi govt do its job and sack the LG for disturbing peace in the city. They should compete in performance with the delhi govt and show similar examples of reducing corruption, bringing corrupt leaders from their own party to task and be a role model. Well this will show up definitely in the Bihar and WB elections which will expose on whose side the real people are. They are not fools and watching everything VERY VERY CLOSELY for a thumping decision .........

Perhaps she should realise that in the case of Delhi, it is the stupidity of the amateur AAP that has caused chaos, not any action of the BJP!

                            Politics is the art of the possible. And I do not think that either Shah or Modi need lessons from a BJP baiter like Ayyub. Kejriwal does not realise that Delhi is the national capital, and the Central Government will always keep a tight grip over it. With Parliament, Supreme Court, foreign embassies, Rastrapathi Bhavan etc. all located there, it will never allow any local government to take over the control of the city. Especially not a dharna specialist like Kejriwal. Kejriwal would be better advised to fulfill his mandate by improving services to the people of Delhi rather than tilting at windmills. He needs to grow up. Fighting corruption cannot be an end by itself. Delhiites also need to carry on with their daily lives.

BJP yet again shows it's only interested in votes, however bad its candidate. They are interested in Manjhi and dalit votes, not the poor dalits. This time, that  Amit Shah will tumble and roll on his round belly. BTW, he's a nobody in Gujrat, an unpopular upstart.

                            Since the unfortunate Gujarat riots entire national &amp; international media and all so called secular parties have only criticized and said negative things about Modi. No one left any stone unturned in projecting him as the demon. But the people of India called everyone's bluff, reposed their faith in him and elected him to lead the country. It seems that the people who had been critical, have nowhere to hide and don't know what to do next. Moreover Modi has not made any critical or grave mistake in his policies or conduct. So the only way he can be attacked is by linking any issue how so ever remote, to him, whether it makes any sense or not. <br/><br/>
Further I would request the respected columnist to kindly explain "What is the correct manner of arrest for someone who has forged his educational documents?"

Only one thing that will decide Bihar is caste, caste and caste only. After all people get what they chose, as we see in in Delhi, a nautanki came promising Sheela  ji in jail, clean politics, and so on, and seems they have more than 3 people with fake degrees itself proves that how people are easily fooled in the country. I am not a fan of ex CM also but the fact is there is nothing about it and she walks free. People have right to experience what they chose for 5 years in India, and they are doing it, with the new name tag of #Garbage the city Delhi, earlier it was to be a heritage city, which is clean.

We all know AAP govt can't find all the money they need to implement what they have committed. Similarly, Jiten Manjhi will be a strategic mistake in Bihar. BJP need to focus on ground work similar to what they did during loksabha elections. That will get them what they need.

                            You must really have an unbelievably low IQ-level to write such a weird article......Your hatred for BJP smells in every letter of the article, but you of course are an "UNBIASED" Journalist of an "UNBIASED" news channel

                            The article is ostensibly about Bihar politics and there is nothing tangible about Bihar in the article. The author would do well to actually leave the confines of delhi and do some meaningful reporting. Having a sensational tag line with poor content is not what one expects of you.

                            Please keep your garbage advice to yourself. We all saw CONgress getting decimated in one election after another. You were from same gang who were saying Modi can never become PM of India and Amit Shah being incharge of UP was a disaster.

                            What is preposterous abt this article, She blames BJP for antagonizing Lalu and Nitish and thereby aiding in those two joining forces, come on You can write betetr than that. Nitish dumps lalu and forges an allianc e with BJP and contibuous despite 2002 and when it comes to BJP deciding Namo for PM dumps the alliance and when he realizes that singularly he cant win Bihar decides to join his betenoire lalu and BJP is to be blamed for all of this..

                            Politics in India is always full of surprises. Bihar would also be no exception. However, I don't understand what makes people write about Tomars arrest in terms of BJP vs AAP. come on the guy has committed a crime and his arrest should                         have been made. Not because he was a minister in an opposition ruled entity.Moreover the issues in Delhi are solely the result of some serious and deeply muddleheaded thinking of the government in Delhi. By the tenor of the article above Law should selectively be applied to garner political brownie                   points.

                            These BJP / MODI Bhakts are so blind that they miss the whole point. She is not in favour of some political party. All she saying that Amit Shah who is a President of such big party, whom people nationwide has given mandate for good governance, should lift his standards the way his party has done. Display of good work ethics. Everyone knows what's happening in Delhi, wait till Supreme Court verdict comes.

                            Ranaji, Great article. Congratulations. how free have muslim women become in India. Had you been living in Iran, you would have been given 50 lashes for not covering the head. Afghans wouldn't have let you out of the house because of the purdah system. Pak has Hudood ordinance to send likes  to jail. ISIS is waiting with scalpel for Female Khatna. God bless India, even muslim women have become journos and nagging at best.

                            The ticking of the wall clock, wrote a seer, tells the hearer that "life's one moment has passed"!So time keeps changing and so also the people of a state in India!Bihar is said to be the lowest ranked (29th) in terms of"Literacy Rate in India! As per 2011 census Bihar's Literacy Rate is "63.4% only"!But during the last decade it has improved by a margin of 16% from 47%!Now majority of Bihar is having good knowledge about their own state as well as of even the remotest one since many of them are well disbursed!Since many are world-wise they don't go by slogans but want to see ground realities!Hence, BJP's slogan of Development has become too much repeated for the last 20 months! Nearly 34% of the population,it is estimated,consume beef!How they could be attracted by the promise of beef ban?Battle of Buxar was fought in Bengal with three unwilling Muslim Kingsand the formidable army of East India Company!But the vote battle of Bihar is between the"Mahagathbandhan" of locals and BJP and two/three local leaders!Further the Delhi defeatof BJP hasput itin poor light!
