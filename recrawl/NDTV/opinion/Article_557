Headline::::Modi's Expensive Penchant for Made-In-Videsh



DateTime::::2015-05-12T02:44:00+05:30




                                Modi bought himself the most expensive ticket ever sold for a cruise on the river Seine - a cool 5,000 million dollars to buy 36 Rafale aircraft in 'fly-away' condition to get the President, Prime Minister, and Defence Minister of France, plus the Mayor of Paris, to beam at the cameras as he chugged up the river. No wonder they were beaming. They had just sold a lemon to the Prime Minister of the country that has emerged as the world's largest buyer of imported arms.
 
Of course, we need fighter aircraft. The Indian Air Force estimates that we need 42-44 squadrons to fight a two-front war, but have only 34-35 squadrons operational at the moment, with every danger of the number of squadrons diminishing to 25 by the end of this decade. Particularly in mid-range, the shortage is acute. So what the defence procurement-wallahs call a 'Request for Proposal', which the more illiterate of us call a 'tender', was put out some years ago for Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA). Six bids were received. The UPA government determined that the French Rafale was the best because the French supplying company, Dassault, offered to supply 18 Rafale aircraft in 'fly-away' condition and then transfer the technology for us to 'Make in India' the remaining 126. Dassault baulked, however, at the suggestion that they should stand guarantee for the quality of Rafale aircraft made by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL). Meanwhile, prices shot up to make the whole deal worth 20 to 30 thousand million dollars, up from the earlier estimate of about $12 billion, and, therefore, on reflection, not perhaps the cheapest of the bids.
 
In comes Modi and upsets the apple cart. Without even informing his Defence Minister (whom he had neglected to have accompany him to Paris) and without consulting the Cabinet Committee on Security, Modi, of his own sweet will, terminates years of negotiations aimed at 'Make in India' to signal that he prefers fighter aircraft which are 'Make in Videsh'. No negotiations are held - that is left to a future date - but to get himself surrounded by a beaming French political elite, he saves a foreign company, Dassault, that is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, by unilaterally and without consulting his experts or political colleagues placing an order for $5 billion worth of aircraft.
 
The number of aircraft being imported from France under this sweetheart deal will form approximately two squadrons, which still leaves us hugely short of the eight to ten additional squadrons that our air force chaps believe we need. Worse, our brave lads in the sky have to deal with the complication of an eighth type of aircraft to our already hugely diverse and therefore unwieldy fleet. Our security has not been enhanced one whit. 'Make in India' has been sacrificed. And the decision has been taken without due consultation. The deal makes no sense.
 
It also completely contradicts the approach to defence self-reliance outlined in Modi's own address at the Aero India Show in February, just two months before he took off for France. Then, he had said, "A nation with a strong defence industry will not only be more secure, it will reap rich economic benefits. It can boost investment, expand manufacturing, support enterprise, raise the technology level and increase economic growth in the country". That is precisely why our defence experts were negotiating a deal with Dassault under which a few sample aircraft would have been manufactured in France and the rest made in India. Modi sabotaged that effort in Paris. Why? What induced him to abandon the slogan of a lifetime - Make in India - just to curry favour with his Parisian hosts? Is India's defence a bargaining chip to be pulled out of Modi's pocket like a conjuring trick?
 
And what of the defence offsets that were being negotiated with Dassault? And that too after having declared at the air show that "I want our offsets policy...to acquire state-of-the art technology and skills in core areas of priority". Why were the defence offsets cast aside in so cavalier a manner when the Prime Minister bought, of his own volition and own sweet will, two entire squadrons of Rafales without getting any defence offsets - that is 'Make in India' - in return?
 
Where is the investment boost? The manufacturing expansion? The support to enterprise? And raising the technology level? Modi said at the air show, "Even a 20 to 25 per cent reduction in imports could directly create an additional 100,000 to 120,000 highly skilled jobs in India". Is even one job going to be created in India by buying $5 billion worth of aircraft from France? Modi added, "There would be a clear preference for equipment manufactured in India". Oh, yeah? Is even one Rafale screw going to be manufactured in India? Modi also said, "From sellers, foreign firms must turn into strategic partners". How does giving up on the French firm's promise to 'Make in India' turn Dassault into a "strategic partner"?
 
And if it is a straightforward trade deal, on what basis has Modi decided that he could not get an equal or even larger number of similar or superior aircraft from other manufacturers at a much lower price? After all, apart from Egypt, no one else has bought a single Rafale. Brazil cancelled its order. It is alleged, with considerable confidence, that Rafale is not a fuel-efficient aircraft and its estimated lifetime costs make it an economic disaster: "the hidden costs of the Rafale project could bankrupt future defence budgets" is one such dire prediction. Did Modi evaluate this before his spontaneous combustion in Paris? Does he possess the professional competence to make such an evaluation on his own?
 
Specifically, did not Modi recall the problems we have been having with France over the Scorpene submarine deal? As Admiral Arun Prakash (Retd), who was involved with the French Scorpene, has remarked in an article published in the aftermath of Modi's Rafale deal, "Obviously, there is need for caution when dealing with French firms." Did Modi exercise the required abundant caution? Is this the way to run Defence?(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mani finds more problems with Modi in one year than Congress has found solutions for the country in 60 years. Had the energy of his party been really invested to govern the country well we would have already been using our own aircraft and not buying from France! The shame is on your folks, Mr Aiyar!

I believe you are forgetting the fact that UPA Govt was the one who chose Raffale jets, So are you trying to say "with considerable confidence" that this was a dumb deal from beginning??

                            Mr Mani, The tender was floated in 2007. And you were in power until 2014. Why negotiations took so long and things did not move forward for 7 years? Give the nature of bureaucracy in India, decision would have taken another few years. Then the costs would have increased further and Indian Air Force would have remained comprised on their preparedness.

                            When Congress was in power, you delayed and delayed the decision, making us vulnerable. Also, don't forget that the reason you are not in power is the numerous scams, which cost a lot more than any Rafaele deal. Thirdly, I'd trust an RSS guy to protect the nation's interests far more than any Congressman - who only asks one question: what's in it for me?

                            You say IAF urgently needs planes. You  say UPA judged Rafale as the best for IAF. Now in the next paragraph you contradict yourself that Rafale is worst plane? Isn't the country the priority? If the IAF needs squadrons of flights urgently I think the smart thing to do is place an urgent ready to fly order. Isn't it great to help a company at a brink of bankruptcy? It becomes easy to negotiate later Mr. Iyer it's a business thing you won't get it. Check your douce Saudi Arabia placed a huge order for Rafale after India

The aircraft which was engineering marvel when UPA was purchasing it became lemon when Modi touched it! Our air force is short of fighter jets, but modi shouldn't buy fly ready fighters! Even garbage is better than his articles.

                            France has been an ardent friend to India, they have shown solidarity towards Indian interests every time, even more than Russia.<br/>
France came to India's rescue, continuing its support to India, toning down the language of UN and helping India launch its satellites from French Guinea. <br/>
During the Kargil war, France made sure that its supplies to IAF were continuous and pertinent. <br/>
India's only dedicated millitary satellite, GSAT 7 was launched from Ariane-5.<br/>
France was the first western country to dehyphenate it's relations with Pakistan with India.<br/>
Agreed to manufacture remaining Rafael fighters in India, even though it was agreed, in 2012 that France will manufacture all of them(118) and hand it over to India, but owing to lethargic decision making by Indian government of that time, the agreement was not implemented. <br/>
This in, 2014, raised the tender cost by about 40%, which was not cost effective for India, hence India was reluctant to continue with the agreement in its original form.<br/>
But France had already manufactured 18 of Rafaele fighters.<br/>
This would have lead to a lose-lose situation for both countries in monetary terms. <br/>
Not only this, this indecision would have lead to collusion and following unprecedented loss in credibility of India, in its relation with an old friend. <br/><br/>
But India and France have now agreed that India will buy 36 Rafaele fighters. The cost of India's previous government's indecision should be borne by India itself and not lose one of its most trusted friends, by betraying on a petty agreement.

This was a well thought and calculated move my Modi which will have immediate and long term benefits for the "Make in India" campaign.

                            It is a blog in which content of one para contradicts the other.If IAF is in a mess and needs fighter aircraft urgently, who is responsible for that. Ten years rule of UPA  or 1 year of governance of Modi? But MSA finds fault with  Modi without blaming UPA for its indecision. Patently biased views may suit a politician, but not an analyst. The readers of your blogs are not fools to believe all the nonsense you are writing. It will do a world of good if you ever care to read the comments section of your blogs.John F Kennedy said, "The problems of this world cannot possibly be solved by sceptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need men who can dream of things that never were." Reshaping India after years of corruption and misrule isn't a task for the weak and indecisive leaders.Bold decisions and faster actions is the need of the hour.NaMo is the one who is capable to do that.

Will this fellow answer why such coffins have been thrust on young pilots and what action was taken after countless deaths? to add to that all the MIG's have crashed flying sorties in peace time.

                            This guy keeps giving a new definition to the word colossal idiot. 7 yrs they sat on a deal without making in India, and now they want to know why the other person has not done it. If HAL was so good at making the Rafale why did they want France to take guarantee for the planes. The Rafale is an excellent fighter and at the current price got by the govt way cheaper than the eurofighter. Even defense minister did not have any problems with the acquisition nor the air force, then I wonder why Mani is so peeved. Is it cos the congress lost out on their usual cut?

                            Mani the moron at his Modi bashing best.  Ask any Indian who would have negotiated a better deal, Mani's hero Pappu or PM Modi and the answer will be one Mani the moron will not be able to digest.  When it comes to the defence of India, cost is but one factor.  Expediency is more significant.  Modi is capable of long term thought and he, together with his team have India's interests at heart not personal interests.  Mani the moron has already forgotten Borfors (beneficiary: Rajiv Gandhi) and Augusta (beneficiary: the family a.k.a. Sonia Gandhi).  We do not need lessons in propriety from an apologist for the family that has kept India in the 1900s when it comes to defence preparedness.  Mani the moron should accept, whether he likes it or not, there is a new sheriff in India; aab ki bar, Modi Sarkar!

                            Administrative decisions on defense purchases are the prerogative of the PM. Rajiv Gandhi did the same when he bought the Bofors gun. The difference is that nobody accused Modi of corruption! You know the rest of the story. There will be no Win Chadda, Quattrochi etc. where Modi goes. Aiyer should bend his historical skills to trace the money lost in the 2G scam, coal scam, Vadra land deals etc. on which he is so conspicuously silent. Would Aiyer dare to comment on the Vadra land deals and hope to remain in the Congress? Aha! Remember no corrupt deals have rocked the NDA government till date. Can Aiyer dare to say that about the UPA headed by the Congress - it was a scam a day! Get lost Aiyer. And stop your putrid commentaries. They stink.

Your Supreme leader Rajiv Gandhi's negotiated and signed the deal with BOFORS AG for suppy of field guns. What technology did BOFORS transfered to India? Are we able to manufacture them in India. The only thing BOFORS transferred is millions of dollars as kickbacks in to Swiss bank accounts of middlemen and their masters. Everyone knows who are they.

                            It is a lame excuse that HAL would not maintain the quality of the Aircraft. HAL has the know how, equipment, technical expertise to make classic aircrafts. It can always achieve any standard. Only the Political will of the Governments has been lacking. Fanciful of buying imported things, the policy makers every time forget that famous &amp; dreaded fighter jets " GNATs " were also made by HAL. That happened in the early stage of HAL, which by now has acquired much more experience. <br/>
Nation's air defence will become safe and self sufficient if HAL is asked to make.

I am no Modi supporter, and would agree with your reasoning to an extent. <br/><br/>
But the larger question is what was the Congress led government doing for past 10 years, that led to, in your own words "..every danger of the number of squadrons diminishing to 25 by the end of this decade."<br/><br/>
This specific decision by Modi Govt - though not perfect - is still better than the inaction we have seen in UPA regime. <br/><br/>

Modi is trying his best to create a relationship with other countries.

So at some point of time a decision has to be taken.It can not linger indefinitely.As alleged whether it is done to please the French  president or somebody else is not the point.It can not be denied that during the congress period Mr.Clean(Antony) made a mess of defence purchase.Well, some decisions may go wrong but decisions has to be taken.

                            Mani is absolutely right. This is a make-in-France deal, that adds nothing to India. 36 aircraft to be delivered over next 36 months at one a month, and no indigenization. How on earth will we buy the balance , 100 aircraft required? Fact is that the deal was good in 2007, but with the French upping the rates and deal price, it was not beneficial in 2014. That is why UPA never bought the aircraft. and out of the blue, Modi, all by himself( with no support from Defence minister, Foreign minister or Finance minister), signs the deal in a flamboyant extravagant flourish, and asks Anil Ambani to ink the service agreements with Dassault. Modi is selling out and outsourcing our defence to external forces.

                            All responses just shooting the messenger, and not dealing with the points raised. Obviously sponsored replies under pseudo-names.

                            Aiyar Mian is here to once again regale us with his "Misal e Hind". Wah wah! <br/><br/>
You are a beacon of truth Aiyar Mian, I am sure thousands of delusional middle class people will swallow your sudden concern for the defense of India and the intricacies of defense procurement. <br/><br/>
After all - wasn't it your great UPA governmence that saw 10 years of MMRCA circus without any result while your ilk were strutting about North Block and South Block of Parliament House ?<br/><br/>
Please edify us with your "gyaan" somemore!

                            Mr Iyer, Modi can only borrow ideas from previous govts which by now have become outdated. He does not have a mind of his own. He thinks and acts like a rustic Gujarati.

                            Regretful that Sonia's snobbish slave has not learnt his lesson even when he has been miserably routed in his own constituency and his party will soon join the dinosaur in extinction. Mr Mani Shankar Aiyar, Modi's Rafale buy is very well thought of, though kickbacks and commissions are glaringly missing unlike UPA regime. So please keep your dirty mouth shut, don't worry about screws of Rafale, just come to terms with the fact that you and your corrupt Italian leader are totally screwed.
