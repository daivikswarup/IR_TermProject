Headline::::My Brother, Ranbir, and My Father, Rishi



DateTime::::2015-07-16T00:58:00+05:30




                                Papa used to play such fun games with my brother Ranbir and me! He had a sort of Koffee with Karan-type buzzer round where he'd ask 20 questions, and whoever replied first would be the winner. Ranbir and I now call this "Dinner with Daddy" - like Koffee with Karan!
And despite his busy schedule, he'd see to it that every Sunday, he would take the family out for a meal - lunch or dinner. No matter how tired or exhausted he'd be from shooting, he'd never forget. Love you, papa.
It's very tough for me to answer who is a better actor - Rishi or Ranbir Kapoor. My dad is the hero, my bro is super brilliant for sure. It's very tough to choose! In the end, I'd say it's all in the family so it's win-win for us. Lol.
I watch every movie of theirs, hit or not. I am definitely biased towards their work and the films they do but yes, they both are always open to (constructive!) criticism and though I don't think I have ever seen a movie in which they have not been good.
Papa's best on-screen pairing was with my mother - and then Sridevi. My dad introduced so many actresses back in the day, and I think being a romantic hero, he looked good with all of them. Similarly, Ranbir looks good with all the actresses he has worked with so far and obviously he has a long stay in the industry, so let's wait and watch who works best with him.
Ranbir is more like my mother, and I am like my dad. But work-wise, they are both so disciplined, professional and passionate about their work - and FOOD! For me, it's just a treat to watch them in front of the camera.
Both Papa and Ranbir are equally possessive - they won't share my mother, and they won't share food. Kapoors love their food - good, wholesome Indian food. And Chinese. At a family get-together, Papa and Ranbir's conversation begins and ends with food.
Ranbir never needed any advice on girlfriends - he was, is, and always will be a charmer :) I was studying in London then but I do remember one thing - he used to go into my room and take whatever I had in my little treasure box and give it to his girlfriend, and that used to irritate me so much. When the girls came home, I'd be like, "Hmmm, now I know where my stuff went."
He was annoyingly naughty. I remember we used to watch a lot of WWF and then imitate it and wrestle with each other. My mother was fed up and warned Ranbir not to fight with me, but to be honest, I used to instigate him a lot.
My dad totally adores my mom - his world, universe, everything is my mother. It's the cutest and the sweetest because even today, he is so in love with her (touchwood!).
My dad is as honest on Twitter as he is in real life - he is a very straightforward and that's what's amazing because in today's times, we need more people like him who are not afraid to speak their mind and are totally frank about certain issues, so kudos to him.
Both Ranbir and Papa are really busy. Ranbir is a total New Yorker. He has studied there, so I am guessing he likes breaks there. My dad loves going to new places - and he loves a good cruise.(Riddhima Kapoor Sahni is a designer and homemaker.
