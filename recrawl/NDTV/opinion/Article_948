Headline::::NYT Cartoon on India is Jumbo Mistake



DateTime::::2015-12-08T16:57:00+05:30




                                An elephant on the rail tracks...if this was an Indian story, it would be about how the elephant was knocked down and died or was badly injured...but since I am talking about a New York Times cartoon, the elephant, which looks bigger than the train, has stopped the "climate train" in its tracks.
Â 

For weeks prior to the climate summit in Paris and most certainly since the summit began, the Western media has been busy portraying India as a problem. The BBC did an article on how coal and coal production, if not regulated, will derail any climate change gains. NYT ran a big article on how PM Modi could make or break Obama's climate legacy. The United States has been portraying itself as the country that created this summit and has taken credit for bringing together all nations for the discussion.
There are so many problems with that position that it is hard to begin to explain. Let's first look at historic responsibilities. Since industrial times, the United States is responsible for 28% of the carbon that is in the atmosphere right now, according to this report. This enabled them to really grow as an economy, to become one of the most powerful countries in the world. India has been responsible for less than 3% of that historic carbon and rightly feels that common but differentiated principles must apply when it comes to dealing with emission cuts for climate change. It seems only fair that the country that has the biggest historic carbon footprint pays more.
Secondly, even today the United States consumes 19 times more electricity that India, produces nine times more of its power from coal than India; the US per capita consumption of coal is 12 times more than India's.
Thirdly, the United States has always been the actual blocker at climate summit, by not even ratifying the Kyoto Protocol which was introduced in COP 3 in 1997. The Kyoto Protocol failed largely because the United States backed out. All the way back in 1997 they objected to the common but differentiated principles when it came to paying for climate change. At the time, India and China had insisted that developed nations do more. Since then, China has emerged as the world's largest emitter, India is the 4th largest. But even here the numbers speak for themselves. While India is fourth on the list, it is only at 6%. China is at 26% and the United States is at 14.4%. India also has 300 million people who live with no electricity.
That India has asked the developed world to quit the carbon space to allow developing nations to grow is entirely fair in the light of these facts. The developed world has also reneged on promises made at previous climate summits to pay a 100 billion dollars annually upto 2020 into a green climate fund for developing nations to help them adapt and to put in place systems for technological transfers to help them switch to renewables at a cheaper rate. The money, many of the developing nations, say should not be seen as aid, but as reparation for historical damages from the carbon already in the atmosphere that has caused the world to warm by 1 degree.
Even in the intended nationally determined contributions, or the commitments made by different countries to the summit, the United States has shown no ambitious steps.
They have said they will cut emission to 28% pre-2005 levels by 2030, while India has committed to 35%. The US talks about being on track to get to carbon neutrality by 2080, but their lateral move over the years from coal has been to natural gas and not renewables in any big way. India has committed to switching to 40% renewables by 2030. Even if it is ambitious, at least we are making strides.
The United States government cannot even agree internally on climate change. While Obama is keen to seal a deal in Paris, as he sees it as a legacy of his office, the opposition or the GOP has consistently denied climate change, with Donald Trump, the leading Republican candidate for President, openly denying climate change on FOX Television.
In India, the entire government agrees that climate change is one of the biggest threats we have. While the United States is 8 times the size of India, they have in their race to develop, lost most of their bio diversity. India is one of the 17 mega-diverse countries in the world.
There is no doubt that India needs to do as much as it can, if not for the world, just for its own people. 13 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in India. Our cities are reeling with bad environment and urban decisions. We have seen extreme weather events affect millions of people across the country. Things are only going to get worse. However, to have the United States pointing fingers is the height of hypocrisy.
The world has gathered to try and ensure a deal that will keep global temperatures from rising above 2 degrees celsius. We have a very short window to make a difference but no deal that is worth anything will be possible if countries do not pull the train according to their weight. So if we are elephants, the United States is a T-Rex.
As a citizen of this world, it worries me that this petty political wrangling could stop us from an opportunity to really make a difference.(Swati Thiyagarajan is an Environment Editor with NDTV)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            I see something entirely different in the cartoon. I see the Indian elephant (representing nature) heroically and with little regard to it's own well being, bringing the evil, polluting locomotive (that is paying lip service to the cause with a sign on the front) to a grinding halt, and thus saving the day! Hooray! :)

                            Very sensible argument finally. When one looks at absolute numbers India may be one of the most polluting country, but when looked from 'Per capita' point of view, it might be one of the least polluter. While West wants to portray former view, reality is in later (per capita) view. We need to do lot more, no doubt. However at this stage of development any drastic or radical steps is impossible for India, at least without harming herself. And with enormous population, it will be most dangerous to poor people.

                            Somehow I feel India will benefit out of this in the long term. US blocked cryogenic technology to India so India developed it's own. US blocked Indian efforts for Nuclear inclusion, now the situation has changed on that front too. While a good climate deal is in India's interest, I am sure this ganging up of the developed world against India will push it even in this dimension and will make word take notice of it in not too far in future.

Please don't make comparisons with USA only. There are many other developed countries(Ex: European ones) who use clean energy and promote their use(tax subsidy etc.).<br/><br/>
If you just let Adani group and Coal India to do cheap coal mining's and use that energy for development, I am not sure our future generation would be very happy about that.<br/><br/>
Please note that Delhi is currently the world's most polluted city(this report we happily rejected).

                            The issue is not whether India is blocking, but whether the blocking is justified. India thinks so. The current mess was created by the developed countries whose extravagant standard of living polluted the entire world. They have to clean the mess and pay more for that. The USA does not want to lower its living standards, but wants countries like India to lower carbon emissions which will directly impact its development. This is a no brainer. So yes, India is entitled to block the conference till a more equitable formula is found. With the US and Europe footing the bill. The USA uses its veto power freely in the UN security council where its interests are concerned. Now welcome to the other side and lump it.

                            Well, i think differently. This is not the time to play blame game. The entire world is responsible for global warming in some way or the other. If we sit back, do nothing, and keep saying that US did this and UK did that, it will be too late! <br/><br/>
Let's face it that our country is heavily populated and the pollution levels are quite high as compared to the rest of the world....and with our corrupt political system, it makes it even more worse! There's no check on the trees getting cut, mountains getting eroded and plundered for natural resources leading to land slides and floods...the list can go on!        <br/><br/>
I am even skeptical of government's move about having odd and even cars on the roads starting from next year. Delhi is so populated that it will be hard to monitor the odd and even number plates....and what will happen if the wrongdoers are caught? They need to have severe punishment for such people, else people will keep breaking the law. Indians will figure out ways to bypass this rule. I can already see the 'jugaad' that some Indians might do - get false number plates made, bribe the traffic police, etc.

                            This per capita argument is the most specious one I have ever heard. The planet and its atmosphere does not care whether greenhouse gases are emitted by a nation of 10 million, 100 million, or 1 billion. It is the absolute volume that matters. We take refuge in our large population because it is convenient as a denominator. <br/>
Yes, the US is culpable for its huge contribution to climate change, but at least sane minds there realize the irrevocable damage being wrought on nature. There are a few insane people there who deny this, for sure. But that is different from a whole nation wanting to burrow its head under the sand like ostriches, like we are, at this moment.

                            @Gurpreet Singh Arora: Thanks for bringing out the point that it will be the ultimate consumer who will be responsible for increased carbon emission in developing nations. Like U.S. by consuming a large portion of things produced in China has made China become one of the worst polluters. If US and other developed nations want emission to be reduced by developing nations by their reducing consumption (which will create intolerable problems to their people's development and set them back by decades), they should also be willing to move down perceptibly in their luxurious way of life consuming all they can.

                            It's always the same old. Posturing against the US, beating our chests like apes, makes us feel better about ourselves. David against Goliath. <br/><br/>
Why do we forget that we can't even breathe in Delhi ? I work in California and we are in our way to achieve our emissions targets for 2020 and we are thinking 2030 now. We are on target to achieve 33% of energy from renewables in 2020 and we are planning for 50% in 2050. <br/><br/>
I don't understand the mistrust against renewables. As if being told to go easy on coal, is a blatant injustice. Solar prices have dropped dramatically over the years and storage technology is following. It's time to embrace clean energy instead of asserting out right to pollute.

                            The author is using the oft repeated argument that the US has become rich at the cost of causing climate change as justification for the intransigence of India and other developing countries. It is not long since scientists have reached consensus that burning fossil fuel is directly responsible for global warming and blaming the US for what it did before that is futile. It is as silly as arguing that one should continue to smoke cigarettes today because lots of Americans used to smoke heavily in the past! Duh!!<br/>
Also, it is quite evident that India is trying to exploit the Paris summit to get a financial bonanza to solve its much neglected power generation needs. What is the point of the entire Indian government being convinced that Climate Change is a major issue if you cannot lead on this issue and instead prove to be an obstacle to the global initiative.

                            Both sides fighting. I dont see this insulting each other is gonna help either. To be frank its not that big of deal to solve this problem. Developed countries can pay the difference between renewable power and coal power to developing world minus china until the actual grid parity is achieved. Special funds can be allocated to RnD with the sole focus to bring down the cost and increase efficiency.<br/>
1) India has problem of its own which only they can solve. For instance india needs to implement its environmental laws seriously. Penalize and industry which violate them. Dont forget BHOPAL.<br/>
2) India has to stop giving subsidy for Kerosene and instead give people solar alternative.<br/>
3) India needs to forcefully put an end to the use of cowdung and burning of agricultural waste.<br/>
4) Burning of solid waste in cities and towns should be made a criminal act.<br/>
5) Water and solide waste treatment capacity of indian cities is almost negligible as compared to the cities.<br/>
6) India needs to seriously support 300 smart city project. Go above politics. The cities of the size of 100000 should be expanded to million and efforts should be made to reduce population in major metropolitan cities like Delhi and mumbai by providing opportunities in these newly expanded cities.<br/>
7) India also needs to promote clean public transport especially BRTS which uses electric buses. TATA and ALL now produce electric buses.<br/><br/>
People talk about pollution in delhi and mumbai. The biggest problem is too many people. Delhi NCR has 47 million people which is more than population of Kenya, Spain, Argentina, even Canada.<br/>
These people will migrate back to Bihar, UP, Jharkhand, UP if u convert 10 cities of the size of 100k to 1 million population city, in these states.

                            The cartoon is by Heng Kim Song based out of Singapore - the same idiot drew the ugly cartoon about India's Mars Mission, for which NYT apologized later. Seems Mr.Song has issues with India/Indians owing to the high numbers of Indian expats there. Shows his bias more than any truth being portrayed in his cartoons.

                            I see this as a golden opportunity for India to realise its potential to come up with indigenous green technology. Manufacturing comes with its 'carbon' price which has been demonstrated as recently in China and as we all see, in the big cities in India. Do we have to have the 1960's tempo's, old auto rickshaws and old Tata trucks plying on our roads spewing SPM's across the length and breath of our country? It has never been beyond the Indian brain to be scientific and Indians have been some of the leading brains in global research in overseas laboratories which have an existing 'system' of excellence in research. What we need is a concerted national push to establish excellent research facilities in India which will enable new 'patented' green solutions to this problem. I am sure that the best Indian brains will return to India if we are able to establish a system where excellence in green research will flourish. We must denounce the tempo jugaad just because it works and come up with a systematic solution to look into a greener future.

                            First of all, at least for our own good, we need to curb the Population explosion in our country. Our arguments about '300 million without electricity' does not make sense if our population keeps on raising at this rate. Secondly, if we are not going to get any help from Developed nations, no need to waste time at the summit, better come out of it and focus on our nation alone and let the Developed nations do whatever they want. We are independent as a nation and for our own good, we need to focus on population control, green energy etc.

                            There is another part of the picture which has been missing in NDTV debates. In the last 1.5 decades, US has moved to a greater gas economy driven by the shale gas drilling developments. It is now targetting India on coal because US has less need for coal today.

The Governments of conspicuously consuming nations have a vested interest in perpetuating themselves. ergo, the status quo. The developing Nations have no choice but to make up for lost time in meeting the aspirations of their people deprived of the good life for centuries.

                            The US is three times bigger in area than India and has a third if of the population. They have more forest area as well. The low low per capita consumption of India does not hold water. Yes India needs to forge ahead and the best approach is to ask for help and it will come.

                            These are quite simple calculations one could make. It doesn't matter whether the US is less energy efficient on capita basis or per gross domestic product (GDP) basis, or what China is doing today and the US + Europeans have done in the past. What India need is to develop (innovate) their own ideas on what's good for the country. For example, can Delhi bear the load of air pollution from the cars on the road, will the odd-even cars on the road is a good enough policy? The citizens of India need to put some unbiased (from the regional politics and industries) assessments various scenarios for urban and non-urban development plans. Of course the policy for different cities will be different depending on their location, regional weather and climate, and available resources. Otherwise we will keep wondering whether someone took us for a ride!

                            When is this 'later'?  I remember reading about the impacts of pollution at least 30 years back.  It is easy to advice others once you've done what you want.  Us still doesn't have considerable public transportation system in many places and people are always using Cars and high cc bikes for commute.

                            I do not know from where the hell this lady gets her statistics. The size of the USA in sq.miles is 3,794,083 while India is sq.miles 1,269,210. Definitely she does not know her arithmetic when she claims that US is 8 times the size of India. As for the other things,The antagonism of the Press notwithstanding, President Obama was smart enough to appreciate India's thrust at the Paris Summit and we are on a good wicket there. No point in crying on the West's present carbon emission  which is really a fallout of the Industrial Revolution which started there over 100 years ago. No apologies intended.
