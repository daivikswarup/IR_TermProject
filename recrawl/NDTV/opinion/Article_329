Headline::::The Assaults on Arvind Kejriwal 



DateTime::::2014-12-28T15:26:00+05:30



(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)The game has begun. It is such a 'beautiful' coincidence that the day the news of BJP's only campaigner, Narendra Modi, holding a 'Mega Rally' in the Ram Lila Grounds became public (scheduled for 10th January 2015) and the day when Delhi was inundated with huge BJP hoardings, was the day eggs were thrown at Arvind Kejriwal at a public rally; the next day stones were thrown at him in another.I know it's not a coincidence. I won't call it desperation nor will I call it frustration; neither will I say that the BJP is indulging in such shameful acts because they are worried about losing. It's clear that Delhi will be Prime Minister Narendra Modi's real test of popularity. It was easy for Modi to trounce and vanquish his opponents in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand and also partly in J&K as people of these states did not have much of a choice. They had to choose the best among discredited parties. In Delhi, on the other hand, the BJP has to fight with a political force which has a very high level of credibility and has earned tremendous goodwill with the masses. Nobody is buying the radio spots the BJP is trying to sell to the people of Delhi claiming that Arvind Kejriwal is not trustworthy, that he can't run the government and will again leave them mid-way.  So the obvious question is why is the BJP doing all this? The answer is easy. It's an attempt to scare AAP volunteers and people who are collecting in big numbers in Arvind's jan sabhas. The popularity of a leader is measured by the number of the people who assemble at such public rallies. The idea is that the possibility of violence or stone pelting will discourage people from going to Arvind's rallies and if that happens, then the BJP's propaganda machinery will churn out theories to prove that Kejriwal is no longer a force in the capital.The very same trick was tried during the parliament elections. Ink was thrown on Arvind and AAP leaders a number of times; Arvind was slapped and hit on his face. Every time the person was caught but the police was not interested in investigating the matter to find out who were the real perpetrators. AAP made official complaints too, but in vain. When the battle shifted from Delhi to Varanasi from where Modi decided to contest elections and Arvind decided to challenge him, the same story was repeated in a more hateful manner.I still haven't forgotten how Arvind and his entourage were hounded in every nook and corner of the holy city. Arvind had reached Varanasi and after a long hectic day when he decided to visit Sanjay ki Addi, a local paan shop, which is very popular with paan lovers, he was welcomed by Modi supporters with filthy slogans; broken bottles were hurled at them. The drama was enacted for a full 45 minutes. Luckily, no one got hurt. It was a warning for him to not be too courageous. The very talented AAP volunteers Nandan Mishra and Ankit Lal though were not so lucky. They were beaten at the famous Assi ghat in Varanasi. Their only crime was to dare to campaign in the BJP's stronghold. Nandan's nose was broken. Another day, at the same Assi Ghat, Somnath Bharti, the Law Minister in the AAP government, was brutally attacked during a TV show. There is yet another scary incident which is still etched in my mind. I got a call around 10.30 in the night that an AAP volunteer had been badly beaten. His hand was broken. He happened to be a Muslim. I was dreading it turning into a nasty Hindu-Muslim clash. I immediately rushed to the spot, requested a Muslim friend to calm his friends, who were very agitated. I had to talk tough to a senior police officer and submit a memorandum to the young district magistrate to requesting attention and focus on law and order in the city. If they thought that such incidents would dampen the spirit of AAP volunteers, then they were mistaken. It rather gave the young fellows a good taste of Indian politics and made them more determined to change the rotten system. One day India will be a democracy where violence will be abhorred; it will not have any space for hooligans but till then, one has to fight tooth and nail.Such fights will make our resolve stronger; as Gandhiji used to say, non-violence is a virtue of the brave. I want to say that our volunteers know fully well that only cowards resort to violence to intimidate peace-loving people. We will take these attacks into our stride as we believe in non-violence. Till then it's a 'good' game of politics; my dear friends. Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            There was even a News 24 sting expose, that showed how the rickshaw driver slaps n other attacks were planned by local BJP members. Even, the guy who threw stone yesterday was the son of a BJP minister, but no TV media showing the same. Media credibility has hit an all time low.

                            Agree with Ashutosh on this- it was a stone-n thankfully it landed before the stage-thankfully no one was hurt<br/><br/>
As I'm writing this comment much later than this article was published probably can also confirm that the kid who did was BJP's Dinesh Goel's son- Saurabh Goel...<br/>
Not gonna discuss this any further as BJP to me is a criminal party any way...With leaders like Amit Shah-they are never gonna win Peacekeeping awards are they...Enough said..<br/><br/>
Having different political ideologies is not wrong-in fact it is to be encouraged in a democracy as all sides of a story must come forward- but there is no place for violence..<br/>
All this time Arvind Kejriwal has done work..only time he gets attacked is when elections are going to be announced?And that too by a BJP politicians son- hatred has no place -I hope BJP understands this

                            Baby Ashutosh, Modi has already been tested in Gujarat (3 times), in Rajasthan/MP/Chattisgarh/Delhi in Dec 2013, then in the most important Lok Sabha elections, then in Maharashtra and Haryana, Jharkhand and JK. So it is your own test of relevance, and from the way your desperation is showing, you are one under test for any leftowver credibility if at all the jhuggi dwellers and auto fellows give you. You have lost Mumbai (only 90 lacs), Bangalore, Delhi, Dubai and NYC - all were poopshows.

                            AAP is going after drama instead of coming up with a substantially different model of governance. They do not have new ideas. They just swing among anti-corruption, populism and vote bank politics. I think they should start with Municipal parties which have far greater impact on day to day lives of people and generally inefficient and corrupt and build the party ground up.

He said Rupee is falling, what did he do about it? It got even worse. He said the low intensity bomb blasts are congress master plans, has it stopped? NO.

                            Ashutosh be realistic. I am staying in Eastern part of Delhi most densely populated. I have not seen on ground any AAP upsurge as you said. Why unnecessary building a wrong impression. Be realistic otherwise your strategies will go wrong. Can you on a individual capacity hold a Sabha.

The route of the AAP is certain. It is the result of arrogance, immaturity, jealousy of AAP leaders. BJP will get not less than 55 seats AAP will get 5 seats

                            Mr. Ashutosh, I used to see AAP as a positive change in politics but soon after Delhi election your team lost the track. Now, you guys are mostly involved in negativism. Are you unable to see shrinking popularity base? Hardly there is any remaining differences between your party and others. Transparency and democracy within your party is missing and it seems only being controlled by whims &amp; fancies of Mr. Kejriwal. Most, including me, who donated funds to your party last year is regretting now. Just to make you realize the amount of damages your party has done I would suggest you to read "Baba Bharti aur Daku Khadag Singh" story. Good luck!!

                            No need to throw eggs, ink,stones or AK. He already has egg on his face, blackened heart and stones in his head. It is about time he learns that blaming BJP for everything is not the solution. He should behave like a seasoned politician now and not repeat his acts of back-stabbing people who are much more respectful than him like Annaji, Modiji and others.

We should hire all AAP members in CID/CBI/NIA because they know the culprits even before any crime could be committed. Salute!!!

                            In his first paragraph, he says BJP is not doing it and later without giving any reasoning he asks why BJP doing this? BJP has been fighting election against lot of other regional forces (yes, AAP is no more than a regional party. Loksabha elections have established the fact.) however, never stopped this low. Why would they give an opportunity to AAP now? This is a pathetic idea and doing of AAP in attempt to create a sympathy among voters cause they know that it's the only way to have any chance in upcoming elections.
