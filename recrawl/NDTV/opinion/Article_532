Headline::::In Mamata Vs Amit Shah, She Takes This Round, Easily



DateTime::::2015-04-29T18:23:00+05:30




                                "Ebar didi gele, dada aashbe (Didi will be thrown out, Shah will reign)" shouted BJP party workers as Amit Shah held rallies in Kolkata in December last year. Shah, fresh from the success of the Lok Sabha elections followed by the BJP's victory in Maharashtra, had claimed that Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of West Bengal would be routed soon. Yesterday, Ms Banerjee's Trinamool Congress swept to victory in  the Kolkata Municipal Corporation polls, bagging as many as 114 of the 144 wards of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.
This election for local bodies was seen as the semi-final to next year's state election - and the Trinamool won by a huge margin, a victory which allowed party MP Derek O'Brien to take a dig at the BJP tweeting, "#BengalVerdict 92 municipalities counting on.Trinamool sweeping. BJP finishing 4th with zero...gas balloon gone phuuuush"The CPI, which recently elevated Sitaram Yechury to chief, fared no better, securing only 18.7 per cent of the voteshare as compared to the Trinamool's 50.7 per cent. The Congress managed the third position while the BJP faced one of its worst embarrassments in recent times, reaching the bottom of the list - it didn't win a single municipality.
If the corporation polls are an indicator, Amit Shah has many lessons to learn, the most important being to avoid playing the communal card when the opposition is Mamata Banerjee.
It must be remembered that Mamata Banerjee and her party spokespersons had claimed last year that Amit Shah was using the Burdwan blasts and identity politics to embolden communal politics in the state. While Mamata Banerjee herself cannot be absolved of all charges of goondaraj in West Bengal, her allegations did have grains of truth in them. In off-record conversations, many in the dispensation acknowledged that Modi wanted Sheikh Haseena, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, to accept a dossier from Indian intelligence agencies that stated that Mamata had been sheltering terror accused from Bangladesh. The dossier allegedly presented to Sheikh Haseena when she met the PM last year was gracefully rejected as the two women are known to be more than amicable political friends. For many days after, there were accusations by the BJP, including Amit Shah, that Mamata Banerjee was responsible for protecting the Burdwan accused. At a rally in January this year, Amit Shah stated  "About a year ago, a blast in Kolkata was hushed up by the state government. If there was a proper investigation, the explosion in Burdwan's Khagragarh would not have taken place. But the state government was more concerned about its vote bank (referring to a sizeable Muslim population in the state). Bengal is a border state and infiltration from Bangladesh is a problem. But here is a government which gives priority to vote bank politics over the national security. They are allowing infiltration from Bangladesh," claimed Shah.
After yesterday's results, Shah may have to confront the accusation that political hyperbole has embarrassed his party which had used 'development' as its calling card so successfully and should have perhaps stuck to that while appealing to West Bengal, which is still reeling behind in numbers where development is concerned.
While humility is not a virtue that has yet been attributed to the West Bengal Chief Minister, it may be noteworthy both for the Left and the BJP to realize that West Bengal wants more than clarion bandh calls. Both the CPI(M) and the BJP have called for a bandh on Thursday in the state to protest against what they describe as the "autocracy" of the Trinamool Congress.
While local body elections in any part of the country are not influenced by the political scenario at the national level, they are suggestive of the mood on the ground, and which way the wind is likely to blow. In the 2010 corporation elections in West Bengal, held just before the assembly elections, the Trinamool made big gains - and then went on to sweep the state.
While a significant part of the Left-leaning votebank now claims its allegiance to the cotton saree-clad "didi" as she is fondly known, the BJP must know that politics in West Bengal is hugely influenced by cadres, muscle power and political maneuvering. After its big defeat at the hands of AAP in Delhi, Bengal has exposed claims of the much-referred-to "Modi wave."  As for Mamata, despite the embarrassing and significant taint of the Ponzi Saradha scheme that has blotted her party, voters, goodwill apparently remains intact among voters - for now.  And her famous declaration - "Who is Amit Shah? I don't know him" - may not appear after all to be unsubstantiated political swagger.

While others like Rana Ayub, Siddarth Vardarajan, Siddarth Bhatia, Vinod Sharma, Aarti Jerath, Neerja Chowdhury, Seema Mustafa, Shoma Chowdhury,Saba Naqvi, Sankarshan Thakur, Kumar Ketkar,Karan Thapar, Aakar Patel....... are Anti BJP

                            I used to read your articles, when you wrote about other states. But know I know, being a Bengali, how hollow and ill researched your articles are. TMC as a party is twice as communal as Left parties are, who are in turn twice as communal as BJP in my opinion. TMC have played the communal(muslim only)card openly and unabashedly in a way which hurts citizens of WB. You need to stay in Bengal and have an open mind to realize this. BJP started communal politics partly to counter other parties which were already playing the muslim card , only to secure their vote bank.

Who in the dispensation? When?  Such unsubstantiated assertions tear the credibility of this article to shreds! Why not quote off the record conversations that confirm the systematic change of the demographic profile of West Bengal and Assam by Bangladeshis? <br/>
Of course this time around Amit Shah has made an ass of himself,just as the BJP leadership did when they backed a rank opportunist like Kiran Bedi. While the gloating by BJP baiters is perfectly legitimate under the circumstances,the fact remains that there is nothing objective in the kind of trash the author has dished out in the name of journalism.

                            Your blog is full of misinformation and one sided perception with just little facts and kind of bleeding hatred to Amit Shah and the PM. Obviously you have the reason for that. Now coming back to your article, the vote share stats that you put up here is incorrect barring the TMC vote share. CPIM secured 25.50% while BJP secured 15% and Congress 6%. So how come BJP is 4th? Yes, in terms of seat since it has won the wards mostly from the Kolkata municipality area but not a single seat outside Kolkata. The BJP candidate in Kolkata South defeated heavyweight candidate Tanima Chatterjee (sister of Subrata's Mukherjee the cabinet minister and Ex Mayor). The reason for BJP's poor show is to do with the state leadership. There is no face of a leader in WB BJP. People are unable to connect or rather accept Mr.Rahul Sinha. At any day he can't be the face of WB as the CM. This apart the muslim vote is again coming back to the communists. People here is disillusioned. They do not like the communists to come back again and neither they are able to find a role model in BJP that they can bank on. Hence I think they are falling back to the logic of "a known devil (TMC) is better than an unknown angel". Additionally you also have to consider the state sponsored violence and rigging that has been staged. In many wards TMC secured 80-90 votes which is highly impossible.

                            Rana is an expert in post facto analysis.  Sadly for her though, nobody takes her seriously.  Bengal is soon going to be without any sort of industry.  Its population will not be sustained by subsistence agriculture and India will be overwhelmed by Bengalis fleeing to find pastures new.  Didi's whole edifice will collapse.  People with a greater knowledge of History than Rana will know that millions of Bengalis were wiped out during the 1943 famine.  That will be repeated soon.  Didi and her supporters will not find any sympathy outside Bengal as she and her henchmen, including the dreadful O'Brien, have been contemptuous of the national interest.  Good luck to the people of Bengal, they will need it.

                            It has got nothing to with Amit Shah in Bengal. Everybody knows how the election was held in Bengal if you have muscle power and gundas with you. Even the election commissioner is helpless in that state's lawlessness. It's such a shame, a question to this lady who posted this as her personal opinion: will you support use of muscle power, vote booth capturing, use of illegal immigrants in proxy votes, hijacking police force, murdering and all anti democratic process to win an election? If no, then why you are glorifying this election result and humiliating Amit Shah!! What he said in the election campaign is actually truth, everybody knows it in Bengal, but hardly anybody could vote there. In the readers' opinion you are never an investigative journalist, you don't have any such skills at all. You are just an ordinary contributor like any tom, dick and Harry in India's journalist world who just survive on yellow journalism, lies and disguised secularism.

The state is reaching pinnacle of lawlessness and pouring in Bangladeshi refugees with Didi making them legal to gain vote bank. A free and fair election happens in Kolkata today; I am sure Didi will lose..not sure who will win.

                            Here is fact in WB politics. Missed call party BJP has 40 lacs members but got only 8 lacs vote. There was a clash in BJP office for ticket. 2 of the BJP district president claimed in public that bjp state president sold ticket for 10 lacs each. They have not in touch with ppl of WB. Only showing their face in TV. In WB BJP has no space  and they are not alternative to TMC. I don't see TMC will replace by anyone even if UN force coming in WB. Mamata did some good thing also some bad. But that's not enough to root her out. BJP should replace siddarth Singh who has only loud mouth not a vote catcher. Amit shah should plan for 2021 if BJP exist by that time. Else left is only alternative. That's the ground reality in WB

That is her entitlement, though it makes her views and reviews suspect. She is right. The TMC has won the civic polls. But will it win the assembly polls? If Ayyub can predict that in advance, hats off to her. Anyone can be wise after the event. And also take the chance to rub in some salt. Will not work. My bet is on the BJP winning the next assembly polls. And the TMC will find itself where the CPM is today. Then let us see what Ayyub and her ilk have to say.

                            Another addendum to my earlier post where I doubted the investigative skills of Rana Ayub and her truthfulness. She glorified the win of the ruling party in Bengal and ridiculed BJP. I will cite a sample result  from ward 38 booth 21 in Calcutta: Ruling party won by 900 votes, CPM got 9, BJP 7, Congress 2, in another case ruling party won by 14000 votes, BJP 9, Congress 4, Left 8. This is the example of your  'investigative journalism' where you have targeted to humiliate Amit Shah and BJP.
