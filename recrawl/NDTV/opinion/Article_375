Headline::::With Today's Speech, Obama Strikes Gold



DateTime::::2015-01-27T16:31:00+05:30



(Ashok Malik is a columnist and writer living in Delhi)Few world leaders are such gripping communicators and have as advanced a masterly ability to exploit every possible media and public moment as Barack Obama and Narendra Modi. The two men are different in many ways. Obama is a studious, professorial sort. If he hadn't been in politics, he may still have been in a university, teaching Law. Modi is much more demonstrative, the 24/7 politician who was educated as he went along, a case study in experiential learning.Yet, the two have much in common as well. Both perceive themselves as removed from traditional elites and power establishments in their capital cities. Both won elections (Obama in 2008, Modi six years later) positioning themselves as outsiders who would fix a rotten, incestuous capital city and rescue a broken economy. Modi used his underprivileged background to devastating impact during the campaign and his biography as a tea vendor's son became a badge of honour. On January 27, at his Town Hall address in New Delhi, Obama not only referred to Modi's childhood but spoke of his (Obama's) grandfather having worked as an ordinary army cook, and of racial prejudice that people of his colour sometimes still face in America. Yet, like Modi, there was no victimhood or defensiveness to such references. Rather, Obama sought to talk up his audience, painting a happy picture of a "defining partnership" in the 21st century between two democracies committed to "fundamental freedoms". In his crisp and yet expansive address, he brought in a variety of subjects - climate change, terrorism, diversity, social discrimination, religious liberties, economic hope, jobs and aspirations, defence and security challenges. Each of the names he mentioned - Swami Vivekananda, "who brought Hinduism and yoga" to America, Mahatma Gandhi, who inspired Martin Luther King Jr, Mary Kom, Shah Rukh Khan, Kailash Satyarthi, Milkha Singh, Mary Kom - was telling of the diversity and richness that makes India so special. In a sense, Obama was seeking to convey that it was this multiplicity of India that made it a democratic miracle. To constitute this unexceptionable comment, this cautionary homily to a nation and a society that has by and large retained its equanimity in a region torn apart by religious and sectarian violence, as a rebuke to Narendra Modi and his government is ridiculous. Visiting presidents are not as unsubtle, undiplomatic and as abusive of hospitality as professional BJP baiters who use every platform and every television studio to chant their favoured propaganda.As a performer, Obama was mesmerising. Whatever one may say about his years in the White House, he is one of the seriously gifted political communicators of our time.On Tuesday morning, Obama freed himself from the shackles of protocol and came into his own. He was what he was first noticed for - talking to ordinary people as if he were addressing each one in the crowd individually. Over the past two days, he had played second fiddle to Modi right from the airport, where his dark suit was outshone by Modi's telegenic orange shawl. Perhaps this was to be expected. Obama was the guest, and Modi was the host and star batting on his home turf. It was his first Republic Day as Prime Minister; Obama was only the chief guest. Nothing could rain on Modi's parade, not even rain itself.Obama is a quiet, reserved man. He came in as a transactional president, without too much of a grand strategy. Even so, he has made a huge effort with both his visits to India. In 2010, he came to a country that he thought was destined for great things and for a longer economic boom. He reached out to India, promised to help it become a member of everything from the United Nations Security Council to the Nuclear Suppliers' Group. Of course, he was betting on an Indian economic growth that would also benefit American companies and job creation.India let him and itself down. It used the very moment to reverse its economic course. Financial year 2010-11 ended an eight-year run that saw an average of 8.3 per cent GDP growth per year. In 2010, Obama was enthusiastic, but Manmohan Singh, the Indian Prime Minister, was tiring and ageing, his political capital having run out.This visit has been a contrast. Obama is ending a two-term presidency and looking to a post-presidency that is never easy to define or adjust to. He is tired and as he told his Sir Fort Auditorium audience on January 27, has more grey hair than when he started. In New Delhi, he renewed some of his pledges of 2010, in the last-chance optimism that India finally has a leader, a government and a popular mandate to deliver on the bets the America of the early 2000s made. On the other hand, Modi was clearly the more energetic interlocutor in the past three days. He is at the beginning of his term and hoping to lay the foundations of his legacy.That is why this meeting of two quality communicators - one the most left-wing of recent US Presidents, the other the most right-wing of Indian Prime Ministers - was so compelling. It wasn't quite what Kipling had in mind, but made for a unique Ballad of East and West.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the

                            Ashok Malik is a Modi supporter. So lets take this with a pinch of salt. The visit was not a very charming PR exercise. Modi sounded, cheap and arrogantly showing off in calling President by his fist name. This familiarity is shows a shocking breach of protocol and diplomacy. Also, all the coverage of "chai-pe-charcha" was a cheap publicity stunt. This afterall a very serious engagement, not a flippant weekend tourist trap.

                            Obama said that to Muslims and Christians to be tolerant towards Hindus and not make fun of Hindu religion.<br/><br/>
India still gives every religion to practice the way they want. He didn't say there should be freedom to convert poor Hindus by Inducements.

                            Good speech from President Obama! After this historic speech, Obama is going straight to USA's best friend, Saudi Arabia where none of the thing that Obama spoke in India is practiced. no religious freedom, no women's right, no freedom of speech! hypocrisy at its best President Obama!

                            It is good the two democracies who should be natural allies are coming together even though there are the cynics warning India about getting too close to America. However, our nation's interests are paramount and as long as we are able to maintain our independence technology and private capital will flow from the US to the largest market both of which are just complimentary. Political parties in India should rise above petty interests and focus on development and nation building to create jobs for its burgeoning youthful population. Ashok Mallik is spot on by saying that Modi did steal the thunder in the first two days while Obama did come back on his own oratorical elements  at the Siri Fort.

                            President Obama has every praise for the development of this country including india's reach to Mars and moon.He has special mention for upliftment of the poor to have largest middle class.He has special appreciation for their technical know how and general knowledge.Time and again he endorsed our social harmony in this versatile and multi religion multi lingual society.He described ours a greatest democracy and their best partner for development.<br/><br/>
But all of us in India time and again made to understand that India has not progressed during last 66 years.Who is spreading this misnomer?Are they really patriotic Indians?<br/>

                            The so called journalist/writer is a great samcha of BJP and what else he can write except appreciating Modi. The visit was a total waste and nothing is going happen in near future and nothing miracle. Total wastage of public money by Indian Government. According to me, Supreme Court should ban this Republic Parade celebrations because so much money is wasted in this.

                            Quoted from New York Times; <br/><br/>
"Mr. Obama's speech was aimed partly at his newfound friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been criticized for not doing more to protect political dissent, guard against sectarian discrimination and tackle human trafficking. In effect, Mr. Obama was saying that their developing partnership did not mean Mr. Modi would get a free pass."<br/><br/>

                            Obama - reference of Madison square and hinting that he might wear Modi Kurta - Clearly admonish PM that - Where people have no clothes to wear. Majority could not get three full meals a day. Where people sleep on footpath. The PM wearing Designers suits and doing fashion parade. The Nation need a serious business nor PR stunts. Obama in his last speech gave a full punch what congress couldn't. He said, diversity and plurality is India's strength. He also say no Ghar Vapsi - Stop all these madness. He also said what India is today. All is achieved in last 66 years. India is nuclear power, reached to space and moving to Mars. He referred this all achievement has been done in the period of Congress. Where 100 of nations failed so long. He also said India need Gandh's wisdom not Nathuram Godse - Panchratna. He showed PM-Modi a mirror and taught him the lessons of wisdom. If Ashok Malik and Media do the Chamchagiri - He will remain in Fools paradise.

                            I don't know why Indians are bending backward over OBAMA visit. it's like they have never met US President. I live in America, When PM of India goes to America, they treat him nicely and stuff but don't fall on his feet like Indians have been doing. <br/><br/>
Modi doesn't have respect for people who he begs votes, during elections he becomes chaiwala, poor etc and after elections look at the amount of public money they are spending be it his inauguration or this republic day, all to build his own image.

                            This is the type of analysis that is required. Bang on. No favouritism to any party Cong or BJP, but at the same time objective analysis of why the West now looks at India (with definite mandate i.e. clear majority Govt, which makes it easier to push through whatever is required, unlike the UPA which could not do possibly because of mere lack of majority and not necessarily because of lack of intent). Such analysis is the need of the hour and we need not have to analyse for mere T R Ps any issue out of context and attributing motives (right or wrong).

                            Dear POTUS, we thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to visit us and appreciate all what we are doing under Mr. Modi. We also are aware of the compulsions that you face from the evangelists back home. So your parting shot on our religious tolerance was expected and we will take it in its stride as we the majority in India is TOLERENT.<br/><br/>
Now please turn to your backyard - where is your tolerance is elevating anyone other than a Christian to the highest post of president?!!!. People actually convert to Christianity for contesting your elections!!!.Your countries gender equality has not seen a women president till now. By a similar yard stich how many of the blacks could reach the office you now adore. <br/><br/>
Where in the world you can see the majority in a country is ridiculed so much by minorities while they enjoy special privileges - constitutional and otherwise. <br/><br/>
Dear POTUS, we appreciate your efforts and shall continue to be tolerant as we have been always. It is ironical that from this great country and after this town hall speech you are heading to a country where if you utter even a quarter of what you said about religion, you may risk going back to your country!!!!<br/><br/>
We are now used to this type of barbs. There were times when we got excited or rebellious about it but now we take it in its stride as we know it is not out of your heart but out of your love for holding on to the position - Jai Hind -- Vande Mataram.
