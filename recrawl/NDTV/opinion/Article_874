Headline::::What Sena vs Sudheendra Kulkarni is Really About



DateTime::::2015-10-12T19:44:00+05:30




                                The motivations for the Shiv Sena's return to hooliganism in Mumbai lie in simple power politics. But they have erred really badly in choosing to target my dear friend Sudheendra Kulkarni and blackening his face for daring to host the reading and release of Neither A Hawk Nor A Dove, the political and diplomatic memoir of former Pakistan Foreign Minister Khurshid Kasuri. Kulkarni is an activist, scholar and writer of repute. He is also a Marathi Manoos, and even went to IIT in Powai. He is used to being targeted by the left and right. He has a thick skin and a genuine spine. Remember the time he spent in Tihar when the UPA targeted him for his role in what came to be known as the "cash for votes" scandal.
 
This was when he got a news channel (CNN-IBN) to partner him in a sort of manipulated sting to trap the Congress and its backers trying to buy up opposition MPs on the eve of the 2008 vote on the nuclear deal. The channel got away, but Kulkarni was arrested and held in jail as an undertrial. In my writing and talks on the state of the media, I have often enough marked it out as a rare case of the "source" of a story going to jail, disowned by the journalists he was helping. I also must acknowledge that Rajdeep Sardesai, editor of the channel then, has had the professional courage to accept this in public, including in his book on the 2014 elections. Even as an activist in the BJP, and as a close and trusted aide of Vajpayee and Advani, Kulkarni has held independent views at variance with the conservative stream of the BJP. I also must make the disclosure that he wrote a column for the Sunday opinion page of The Indian Express when I edited it. I felt honoured too when he chose me to be among speakers at the launch of his book Music of the Spinning Wheel: Mahatma Gandhi's Manifesto for the Internet Age at New Delhi's Gandhi Smriti in September 2012.
 
He is a diehard Gandhian, even if I, and many other contemporaries, would find his views outdated and disagree. If the Shiv Sena's idea was to intimidate, they chose absolutely the wrong person. In fact, Kulkarni turned the tables on them by appearing at Kasuri's press conference still smeared in the black paint, and reminded the entire country that Sena boys had thrown black ink on him while he was dressed in clothes representing the Tricolour. This was indeed a very sophisticated putdown, but it also brought back to me a college-time memory of when Chaudhary Bansi Lal, then chief minister of Haryana, was greeted by his electricity board union protestors waving black flags. "You people think black flags will scare me?" he asked. "When I was born, my mother was wearing a 12-yard black ghaghra. If that didn't scare me then, how will a few strips of black (kaali jhandi) scare me now?" But that was earthy Haryana, this is genteel Maharashtra.
 
What isn't genteel, on the other hand, is the politics of Maharashtra and the way the Shiv Sena sees its place in it. The party has declined consistently in the past 15 years. It isn't due to one reason, like Balasaheb's health and age, Uddhav's inability to fill his shoes, rise of his cousin Raj as a better headline-hunter or the arrival of the BJP. It is obviously a combination of all of these, but the biggest political factor is a strategic blunder made by Balasaheb Thackeray, which no Sena leader or ideologue can publicly admit.
 
The Sena was always set up as a local force with a local and later ethnic/linguistic agenda. The Congress helped along its rise early on (there is a little bit of this in Anurag Kashyap's Bombay Velvet set in that era). Local Congress stalwarts, in cahoots with mill-owners and builders, used the Sena to destroy both left-socialist and then mafia (Datta Samant) run unions. Balasaheb then latched on to Marathi language and "Manoos", as the sons of the soil were called. It was only around the Babri destruction months in 1992 that the Sena emerged as a truly Hindu communal force not only to rival the RSS, but to sideline it. It hasn't grown out of it.
 
It worked for some time, particularly as it made common cause with the BJP and gained power in Maharashtra and, more importantly, in the city's super-rich Municipal Corporation which became the party's ATM for patronage and resources. But it continued on with "Hindutva-vad" rather than return to its own "Maharashtra-vad". This was a fatal error. Because as Narendra Modi rose, no Hindutva supporter needed any other force to back. The Hindu agenda was lost to Modi's BJP which became the much larger partner in the coalition, thereby completely reversing the state political equation.  
 
The Sena is now a junior partner, and had to grovel its way back in the coalition after having left it. It detests the BJP and its chief minister, particularly as they have stopped the old revenue stream for political mafias and parties (sometimes synonymous) in Mumbai. But it can't break away for fear of losing control over the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as well. It wants its lost power and glory back. It also wants to get back its headlines and its dadagiri over the city which it once owned. It believes it can only do so by undermining its own senior ally, the BJP, and its chief minister, who it sees as an outsider and a usurper. Kulkarni, Ghulam Ali, Kasuri are just collateral victims of this desperation.(Shekhar Gupta hosts 'Walk the Talk' and 'Chalte Chalte' on NDTV.

                            I am totally against against Shiv Sena for what they did. However, I am also against Kulkarni for what he has been doing. Is he some kind of diplomat or what who is trying to run a parallel government? First meeting with a terrorist and now trying to endorse the views of a Pakistani official and that in India. Kulkanri should stop mocking Indians, he isn't above the country.

                            Write and talk as much as you can. Same applies to any citizen of India but check the hard core reality of India as well. Nothing and no one has ever could change anything by standing up against political establishment in India from the time of 1947. We could and we would vent our frustration at our own peril but thats about it. By tomorrow no one would remember this unless some other political party feeds medi to keep this alive or till the favourable settlment.

                            I really feel pity,at the wisdom of so called scholars of India,by supporting this what are they trying to prove?that look though Pakistan is a rogue nation,they are responsible for killing our citizens by spreading terror activities,but look we are born with golden heart! Have you ever gone through the pain who lost their beloved ones? This very former foreign minister has always opposed India at UN &amp; have always supported it's illegal occupation of POK. when ever Pakistan violates cease fire &amp; starts shelling on our troops,these intellectuals,are often seen on NEWS channels, giving their expert views,against Pakistan &amp; when their artists cross over to earn money,they are often seen standing in their support,is it  not double standards on their part? Now they are supporting their ex foreign minister,it is shameful on the part of the former minister,that now he wants to sell his book to India citizens to earn money,where as when he was in the office he supported all the terror activities carried out by Pakistan to kill Indian citizens! but what is even more painful is our scholars are supporting him!

                            Where Shivsena and handful of Hindi organizations get it wrong is VIOLENCE. That doesn't mean the stand on whether beef or on Pakistan is entirely wrong. Nationalistic people should be FIRM and RESOLUTE but non-violent. I think BJP is doing just that, it just that it is not communicated well and some outfits are giving it a wrong name by taking laws in their had which can never be allowed. After all we have had proxy wars, Parliament attack, 26/11...How can you forget all of this? You don't have to cow down just because...

                            Very good analysis. But the true fact is that the Sena never had a positive agenda or a proper ideology. Hooliganism, targeting Biharis, jobs for locals are all short term emotive issues. It is therefore bound to collapse in the long run. As India including Maharashtra becomes richer and better educated, all these local emotive issues will lose traction and the Shiv Sena will stand exposed for what it is. A bunch of illiterate rowdies. They won some MLA seats because of the BJP. Once they leave the alliance their fate will be the same as Raj Thakeray's MNS. Seats in single digits only.

                            Very biased article, Shekhar.<br/><br/>
First of all, it is Sudheendra claiming SS attacked him and national media is fueling this theory, is there any official word from Sena or police confirming it? Your dear friend Suudhy is very much capable of plotting such act.<br/><br/>
Second, abt your claim that SS is on decline, I guess last assembly election SS had impressive performance of their own (offcourse BJP won max seats,  thankx to Modi wave, money power and Center cabinate canvassing at village level).,Mumbai, Thane and Aurangabad municipal corporations are still with SS. 19 MPS are representing SS in Loksabha, it is 3rd/4th largest party in the loksabha. SS is one of the oldest undivided political outfit started in 1966,  how many current political parties were formed before 1966 (except Congress and CPI)?  SS doesn't have Chamcchas in mainstream media, doesn't mean it is party without base and acceptance from the masses, people have been electing and SS has been around for about five decades now. <br/><br/>
To get your fact correct, numerically SS is where is was always been even during Balasaheb regime as SS chief. So your decline  and revival effort theory to glorify your dear friend Suudhy don't go well.<br/><br/>
Irrespective of political gain/loss or negative media coverage SS always stood for what it perceived right. There can be endless debate on what's right or wrong and that is where likes of you and Suudhy do single minded chamkogiri on national media.<br/><br/>
Expecting unbiased analysis from person of your stature.

                            It is fanaticism of right wing fundamentalist forces. If gone unchecked this country would soon be ruined. It is time for people to decide if they want India as a secular state.

                            The whole episode was nothing but a publicity stunt. Shiv Sena by the only well known tactic it has been applying, has erred in helping to provide free publicity to a person who can not deny his part in the terrorist activities sponsored in India, particularly in Mumbai. Kulkarni is a veteran to utilise any small opportunity to his advantage and perhaps won thousands of admirers in Pakistan if not in India. Unfortunately, Our country has hundreds of such lip service activists claiming them to be intellectuals. Ultimately, the country has been put to shame by these self- proclaimed Patriots and intellectuals. Media, in it's anxiety to earn TRP ratings, made Kasuri almost a Mahatma spinning charka. What a pity?

                            Political  parties (owned by families ) that  have remained   in power  ,when  going  to  Textinction  behave  in  this  frustrated  way. Thus  they expedite  their own  downfall. Hop India  will get  rid  of  this  type  of  political  parties

                            Surprised to hear sooooo many things good about Kulkarni. Generally it is said, he makes every one a sucker for his gains, starting with RSS, BJP and to-day it has ended with Sena and probably may land on Kasuri. But Mr. Gupta's assessment must be correct, other wise Congress lead UPA, would NOT have sent him as one of the "interlocutor" to Kashmir !!

                            The Shiv Sainiks have been a nuisance from the very beginning and the continue to be so. While Shekhar'a article make eminent sense to any rational neutral person it is doubtful that it will make any difference to the Sainiks.

                            However politely you may put it,Shekar Guptaji, you must admit that it was the Congress who first made  the cartoonist Balasaheb Thackerey into a cricature of himself as the SAVIOUR of Maratha Manoos for their own ends. It had its innings and now we see the sad spectacle of a son, sick both in body and mind running the unruly mobsters and 'running with them' for his own survival. This body calling itself as the saviour of the Marathas needs to be disciplined simply because he is spoiling  the fair name of both his city and the whole country.

                            If Mr. Kasuri has condemned 26/11 Mumbai attacks and Pakistan sponsored terrorism before entering India he will not have received protest. But unfortunately he has never condemned terrorism

                            One thing for sure. Even though the hard liners are getting the desired media space to put them or keep them in the limelight, the peace loving and rational minded majority of this country disagrees with the pitch of hatred and aggression. There are serious social and economic problem which media and eminent journalist should focus on. Any word of condemnation will only embolden the likes of people who does all these non sense, Hence the bitter medicine is to ignore them except for reporting the facts. By taking such acts to discussion forums could do just the opposite effect than that desired by well intended writers

                            Yet another masterpiece by Shekhar Gupta. Whatever was done to Sudheendra Kulkarni,whom I do not even know, has in fact bounced back on the face of the So Called Honorable people where the Black taint is going to stick around on their faces far longer than what it did to Mr. Kulkarni,s face as he was all clean at the time of the launch of the Book,looking even more brighter with a glow. So how did it help theirs cause,Book Launch got more attention, Mr Kasauri will see more books,there was very vehement condemnation from all quarters.,on the contrary.<br/>
Any Party,any organization or any Group once it deviates from their moral ideals ,the Public support also  goes for a downward spiral. Shiv Sena used to much condemn  the Dynastic Rule and has now become the victim of its own lofty ideals  which are noticed by all even if there is no loud voice within the organization. Agenda too has backtracked to mob style methods and such of tactics are being abhorred by all sections of the Socialist ety.<br/>
It will be courageous of the higher echelons of the Party to do enough soul searching after this evil conduct So as to do a course correction<br/>
 Otherwise there will be less of sympathy of the masses and more of  hatered.<br/>
Let us hope the Shiv Sainiks will rise to the occasion to remain a force to reckon with but for the good of the Society only.

                            I read shekhar gupta. But can u say how the shivsena formation took place. It was only for throwing out all the South Indians from Mumbai through goondaism and they have formed shivsena. And this party want to become an All India party by putting many cañdidates in Bihar. BJP should have joined hands with NCP that would have been better.

What is this dubious bad-sanghi, good-sanghi drama? BJP is AS MUCH to be blamed for this. Shame on you Sehkar for being so pro-RSS.
