Headline::::Why BJP Has Wasted Its Big Bengal Opportunity



DateTime::::2016-01-18T15:07:00+05:30




                                There's been a lot of news around the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal recently. New appointments. Big rath yatras. Mega-rallies planned with central leaders. Pressers, protests and backroom maneuvers. Such news tends to feed the hype of an upcoming saffron surge in the state, ahead of state elections.
But figures seldom lie. The party logged its best ever performance in West Bengal in the 2014 national elections, with 16.8% of the vote share, but was wiped out in the state's civic polls in 2015 with not a single civic body won (out of 95 that polled in April and October) and only 7 of 144 wards in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (in the 2014 national elections, it led in over 25 ward segments).
 
Here's why things may not get much better. The West Bengal BJP seems to have one game plan: communal polarization. The party hopes to set itself up as a counterpoint to Trinamool Congress Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's "Muslim appeasement". Banerjee's government has, among other things, given doles to imams, stipends to muezzins, bicycles to Muslim students, prevented the telecast of a TV serial written by Taslima Nasreen, and announced that the Aliah University in Kolkata would be renamed the 'Aliah Madrasah University' (following a protest this wasn't implemented). The BJP, in turn, has been screaming itself hoarse about illegal immigration, Muslim terror and the Trinamool's "appeasement politics" for over a year.
 
More recently, in what is being seen by party members as an all out Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) takeover, it appointed RSS man Dilip Ghosh - who was brought into the West Bengal BJP little over a year ago from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands - as state president. Insiders say Ghosh was not even on the list of prospective candidates, which was made up only of names like Subhash Sarkar and Chandan Mitra - old party members - till the last minute. His appointment has been followed not just by new youth and women's wing heads, but also a complete restructuring of the district committees, something Ghosh is overseeing himself. Simultaneously, there are reports of new RSS shakhas springing up in the state.
 
Just in time. 2016 began with the Kaliachowk riots in Malda, where a Muslim protest turned shockingly violent, leading to widespread vandalisation and many injuries. "It was the BSF versus the people," said Chief Minister Banerjee, blatantly trying to gloss over the event. "There is no such communal incident or tension." Now, with BJP state-in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya making statements like, "West Bengal will become another mini-Bangladesh," and "The minority community is somewhere linked to all these (antisocial) incidents", polarization from both sides is set to escalate further.
 
This may not work, at least not in time for the 2016 assembly polls, for various reasons.
 
First, history. The partition of Bengal may have created fault lines in the state along religious lines, but there was a conscious effort on the part of various artists, intellectuals and politicians, at various points in history (Reunification in 1911, the United Bengal Plan at the time of independence), to ensure these fault lines don't deepen. After the Left (CPI and CPM) took over West Bengal, they created new, often violent divides along political lines (dividing Congress and Left supporters and cadres), but religious communalization took a backseat.
 
Second, culture. There are fewer cultural differences between Hindus and Muslims in West Bengal than in many other parts of India (most Bengali Hindus, for instance, are non-vegetarian). Even geographically, the divisions between Hindu and Muslim villages and areas in West Bengal are hardly as distinct (with exceptions) as in some other parts of the country (in the Hindi belt, for instance).
 
And thirdly, let's return to the figures. Reportedly, over 30% of West Bengal's population is Muslim (27.1 as per the 2011 census). Muslims make up a sizeable number in most districts, the majority in a few. Contrast this with Gujarat, where the BJP ran a successful polarizing campaign in 2002. According to the 2001 census, Muslims comprised only 9.1% of the state. So the "Gujarat model" for communal polarization, that was implemented by the RSS and BJP in other states as well, may not be as easily importable here.
 
Why doesn't the BJP have a Plan B for West Bengal? The party has hardly any cadres in the state. A vast section of crowds you may have seen at recent BJP rallies are often bussed in from neighbouring states like Jharkhand. But for state elections in West Bengal which, for a few decades now, have been marked by more instances of violence and booth capturing than many other Indian states, you need enough workers to guard every polling station (2011 had 70,125). The TMC has assured cadre for this throughout the state, because of a system of hefty doles to sports clubs (for instance, early last year Banerjee announced Rs. 150 crores for 7,000 clubs) and tacit support to local syndicates who run illegal businesses or extortion rackets. The clubhouses, like the Shiv Sena affiliated mitra mandals in Maharashtra, serve as nodal points for party workers to collect and organise themselves (they are mostly located close to booths, often they become polling stations themselves). The Left too, has its old cadre network through which it hopes to mobilize remaining supporters. The BJP hasn't so far built any structure of the kind.
 
Also, it has failed to conduct any lasting mediatized anti-establishment campaign like Banerjee had done with issues such as Nandigram, Singur and Rizwanur. This despite there being many opportunities, such as the Saradha Scam and rampant law and order problems in the state.
The key reason for its failure to build and oppose has been faulty leadership. Rahul Sinha, President till December last year, was unable to control infighting within the party. Siddharth Nath Singh, the BJP's prabhari (state-in-charge) became the party's most visible face in media and on the street. Prabharis are meant to work behind the scenes, bring fresh ideas to state units and, objectively resolve disputes between factions. This is why they are often not from the state they are placed in charge of. But Singh taking centre stage created a whole new faction within the party as well as resentment among party workers and voters- they didn't want to be dictated to by an outsider.
 
To fill the leadership void, the party has brought in celebrities in key positions as candidates and officials. Rupa Ganguly, film actor, Women's Wing Head. Babul Supriyo, playback singer, Lok Sabha MP. Sharbari Mukherjee, TV actor, candidate for Kolkata Municipal Corporation. The Trinamool did this too to ornament their party structure. But ornamentation isn't a substitute for substantive political leadership.
 
The Modi Wave of 2014 gave West Bengal BJP a big impetus. But instead of using that momentum to quickly put down roots and grow a presence, the BJP seems to have expended its energies in RSS-izing the state instead. The sangh and the party go together, but the leaders of both have to decide which one to place first. Its choice so far is clear. It may be looking at a long-term game but, for 2016, the BJP has squandered a great opportunity.

                            BJP has 3 simple mantras<br/>
1. If u cannot convince them, communalize them<br/>
2. If u are not with us, u r against us(and of course anti national)<br/>
3. Any barbaric act committed by any party member or affiliate party member that is made public should be countered with "congress has done, so we can do it"

                            It has become really fancy to blame BJP for everything. Why are there no accusations on BJP where there are no elections? Why are there no resignations. This site is really becoming extremely anti-BJP site

                            Basically BJP was/will be, a one election wonder of 2014.The cocktail of modi rhetoric along with the CAG uproar of "corruption" and Anna hazare/Ramdev pitching in, caused a tsunami against the Congress. However It did not make for a pro BJP/RSS/Hindutva wave. As time passes, and the anti congress, Tsunami recedes, the country's politics is back to normal. Delhi and Bihar results are the new normal, and so BJP will recede back to being a non entity in the assembly elections. Modi's bluff of some silly "gujarat model" has been busted. People cant get fooled again on a "development agenda", with so much of poor performance of Modi govt.

                            A beautiful political insight given by Rishi Ji in the present day West Bengal. Apparently the BJP is going to meet the same fate as Bihar. There too Amit Shah committed the blunder of reigning in outsiders for the elections which he appears to repeat in Bengal as well with ominous consequences.

                            Where ever BJP wants to make inroads, communal polarization is its first strategy. It is time tested and has given great results to the party right from the days of Advani's rath yatras. 2014 Modi elections were different in that sense. They followed a 'development' strategy for the marginal swing voters who sit on the fence and tapped into the disillusionment of Congress's non-governance ... but they also followed their traditional communal strategy in UP and made it very subtle to pander to their core extremist base. This two-pronged strategy: obvious development and subtle communal strategy gave them good results. If they want success, they should stick to this new strategy rather than the old one.

                            Well written. BJP needs to show what alternative it has to offer and how better is that in compared to Red, White and Green parties. Communal Polarization in W.B. will not work in favour of majority.

                            Civic poll was all a staged affair. You have to be in Bengal to know the truth. In our ward, in just 15 minutes 86% voting was done. But just wait and watch for Assembly elections, with huge troops deployed, manufacturing wins is not going to be possible. Urge CVC to deploy huge troops to Bengal for elections. From a concerned citizen of Kolkata (Budge Budge area).

                            NDTV is now has become mouth piece of AAP party, even a small sneeze by kejriwal comes in headline in NDTV. This channel was mum on MALDA violence and  was asking to maintain peace and that news didn't appeared on front. But now since last day this DALIT suicide is on their front news since yesterday and it is keep fueling this debate. I know it will continue for another week and Raul Gandhi will visit today or tomorrow and give it useless lecture

                            See, BJP does not need West Bengal. West Bengal may need BJP, me not sure. West Bengal have seen Left rule and now seeing TMC rule. It is their choice. WB did not give much seat in general election to BJP. Certainly, you get what you deserve by your decision making. BJP are minnows in WB, Assam and Kerala. So, where does the question of BJP coming to majority come ? Are you not seeing what is happening in Bihar on daily basis?? So, choice is yours, not BJPs..

                            BJP is primarily communal, fascist. They grow by strengthening communal hatred feelings, where they have grown it's sane. Wether in UP, Gujrat, only on hatred with minorities and Nehru-Gandhi family. Down with BJP, they represent CIA, British- Jinnah two nations theory. People of WB and Assam, stay away from BJP.

                            People poorly understand the Gujarat model and hence they get beaten at their arithmetic and predictions again and again. After 2002, Gujarat has seen many elections - 2007 state elections, 2009 general elections, 2012 state elections, 2014 general election. In each of this elections, BJP has won and there has been no communal agenda. It has won because it performed. Now under the corrupt brokership of CM Anandiben Patel, Gujarat is losing BJP slowly and gradually. The current CM is super corrupt with her daughter and son-in-law personally brokering deals and taking corruption money. So much so that even peons have started asking money, openly claiming, if CM takes, why should he. In the next elections, if BJP loses Gujarat, it shall be because Modi allowed his personal chemistry precedence over merit.

                            like most ppl in bengal who can write in english.. u too seem to be oblivious or are at least pretending to be oblivious to the scheme for the girl child(kanyashri), increased support to small &amp; medium scale farmers, improved heath facilities, increased education facilities, proper usage of funds, providing medicines at fair price to the impoverished, peace in jangalmahal &amp; darjeeling, a clean Kolkata, and above all, convincing a state full of lazy idiots who never worked fr 34 yrs to cm to ofc on saturdays.. .. all of these contribute to the sustenance of tmc in the state.. even though nobody is perfect.. nd thr r several loopholes in the current party as well.

                            so when commies and Mamta, appease and polarize musleems , it is ok and no problem.  Even if that appeasment is creating national security problems and changing the demography in border districts, sickulars and liberals have no problem but when BJP protests the appeasment and raises the  security issues, they are  communalising and doing polarization. So musleems can be appeased and nation can go to dogs but when some body opposes it and tries to unite majority against the danger, these sickulars  start shouting. India is full of traitors...
