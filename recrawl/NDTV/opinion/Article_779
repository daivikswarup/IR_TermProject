Headline::::With Pakistan, Modi's Big Own-Goal



DateTime::::2015-08-25T16:50:00+05:30




                                The last few days have revealed the utter immaturity of foreign policy under Narendra Modi. Foreign policy is not about clocking up frequent flyer miles. It is about having goals; a strategy to attain these goals; and tactical flexibility to meet unforeseen contingencies as and when these arise so that overarching goals are not lost sight of in temporary maneuvering. And the first principle of all diplomacy is PREPARATION, so that summit meetings do not flounder on account of the ground not having been adequately prepared. On every one of these counts, Ufa, and everything that followed, has been a diplomatic disaster without precedent.
Was the intention of the Ufa meeting to resume the India-Pakistan dialogue - or to sabotage it? If the former, nothing has been achieved - and much has been lost. If the latter, why did Modi (and Nawaz Sharif) succumb to the combined pressure of the Russians and the Chinese to either talk or remain on the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization? What is clear is that by buckling at the knees when the Russians and the Chinese warned the Indians and the Pakistanis at Ufa that they must either shape up or ship out, both sides went into the summit without either being properly prepared. Not even the elementary courtesy of Modi going forward to meet Nawaz Sharif had been chalked out.
They awkwardly talked of this and that but not of what had necessarily to be foremost on their respective minds - Kashmir, as far as Nawaz Sharif was concerned, and the Hurriyat as far as Modi was concerned since it was Modi who had made the Hurriyat the stumbling block last August by breaking off the scheduled Foreign Secretaries' talks because the Pakistanis routinely arranged to meet the Hurriyat as they have been doing for a decade and a half - without, it might be added, doing any good to themselves or any harm to India. It was a whimsically thought-out, last-minute red line that completely emasculated the meretricious invitation extended to Sharif to attend Modi's swearing-in. Thus was the swearing-in quickly converted into a swearing-at.
Why, after all, baulk at the Pakistanis talking to the Hurriyat? The Hurriyat is an ill-assorted collection of mutually warring factions who need security principally to protect themselves from assassination by one another. They do not present a united front. They do not represent the bulk of Kashmiri public opinion. They do not have the gumption to fight elections - and when they do, through surrogates, it is not the Hurriyat stand-ins but the mainstream parties that win Kashmiri votes. The Hurriyat are little more than a nuisance that should, can and have been contained. By rendering the India-Pakistan dialogue hostage to the Hurriyat, Modi has raised the Hurriyat to the status of arbiter of the sub-continent's destiny. What a silly own-goal to score.
And the irony is that it was none other than Lal Krishna Advani, as Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, who first gave the Hurriyat its over-estimated standing in J&K. It was he who opened a dialogue with them. A sensible move that was later resumed by the UPA government, especially when the Interlocutors Team attempted to interact with them. It is, thus, we who have recognized the Hurriyat's locus standi. And we did so after Pakistan initially sought to portray them as the spokesparty of Kashmiri opinion.
Of course, the Hurriyat does represent a section of Kashmiri opinion - or rather, more accurately, a bundle of contradictory opinions. And, therefore, since Kashmir is an "atoot ang" of India, it is meet and proper that India should seek to engage with them. But if Pakistan talks to them - as it has been fruitlessly doing for 15 years - and misleads itself into thinking they represent majority opinion in the Valley, how does that make them a "third party" to the India-Pakistan dialogue as Modi's External Affairs Minister has been claiming?
In any case, if Modi remains mired in the belief that the Hurriyat issue is more important than putting India-Pakistan relations back on track, why did he not ascertain categorically from Nawaz Sharif in Ufa whether Nawaz had abandoned the Hurriyat track? Why seek dialogue at any level before first sorting out the tangled issue of Pakistani interaction with the Hurriyat? Had Nawaz remained as intractable on talking to the Hurriyat as Modi is on Pakistan not talking to the Hurriyat, was it not totally counter-productive to set up a dialogue process without sorting out the basis on which the dialogue would move forward? Should this not have been quietly resolved at Foreign Secretary level when Dr. S. Jaishankar went to Islamabad? Especially as poor Sujata Singh had been unceremoniously sacked just to make way for Modi's favourite IFS officer as her replacement?
Clearly, for Modi, the Hurriyat is more a red herring than a red line. He does not want to engage with Pakistan because his RSS background and his RSS masters detest Pakistan. Until that changes (and it won't), one can kiss goodbye to any significant improvement in relations with our most important neighbor. We are on the edge of nuclear annihilation because the Prime Minister, in pursuit of Hindutva, wants 'Hindudom' (Savarkar's own translation of the word he had coined).
The longer term damage to India-Pakistan relations is that where for the first 50 years of Independence, it was the Pakistanis who were a one-issue country, insisting that unless and until Kashmir were resolved there was no point in moving on any other matter, it is now we who have become the one-issue country. Perhaps the biggest breakthrough in India-Pakistan relations was in 1997 when, under Inder Gujral as Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Salman Haider as the principal negotiator, there was the fundamental breakthrough at Murree that there would be a "composite dialogue" in which all issues would be tackled across the board, including terrorism and Kashmir (which, since Shimla 1972, we had agreed to talk about bilaterally). Unfortunately, the "composite dialogue" process had lurched forward on a stop-go basis for the last 18 years in the course of which Modi has apparently forgotten that it was we who had wanted to talk about everything and now it is we who want to talk of nothing but "terrorism".
That might be a worthwhile objective if it were feasible. Whether or not it was feasible should have been tested in advance instead of being slipped in through sleight of hand at the last moment. We claim the Ufa statement said the NSAs' talks would be about "all issues related to terrorism", and stress the last word. The Pakistanis, for their, part, stress the first two words "all issues" - and argue that to discuss terrorism without reference to Kashmir is to miss the bus altogether. Indeed, it is we in India who have long stressed that terrorism in Kashmir is the major issue. What terrible drafting that the two sides can literally pick two ends of the same sentence to argue past each other! That is what happens when there is not adequate PREPARATION.
Modi's foreign policy has brought his own personality centre-stage to the neglect of institutions, making all important decisions HIS decisions and all important moves HIS moves. The Foreign Office has been sidelined. Professionalism has been cast to the winds. The External Affairs Minister has been rendered a decorative irrelevancy. And in place of a team of advisers, a policeman has been dragged in as Man Friday. Is this how foreign policy should be run? By contracting it out to the Indian Police Service?(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

If Nehru let Sardar Patel to resolve Kashmir issue in 1947 then this wouldn't have Ben boiling. Modi has just given a chance to bring these nuke terrorist on table but they miserably failed or ran away fearing Modi and A Davol. Please read your party's history and say something. This issue was created by your party leader.

                            The usual gibberish from Aiyer. If Congress could not figure out how to handle a failed state like Pakistan in 60 years, how do you expect Modi to do it in one year? All issues relating to Pakistan are directly traceable to Congress failures. Starting from Partition itself, which was the result of Congress obduracy in not giving sufficient berths to the Muslim League. Kashmir became a problem because of Nehru's foolishness in referring it to the UN for a referendum. The only intelligent thing ever done was freeing Bangladesh from Pakistan. Since you pretend to be a student of history, you should know these basic facts before shooting off inanities. All the advice that Aiyer now gives Modi should have been given to the Congress leadership instead. But what to do, just like the BJP, the Congress always ignored Aiyer and his nonsensical ideas. Get real. Just sycophancy will not get you anywhere. You need to have stuff where it counts. Between your ears.

Can you not have the political maturity to not crucify everything he does? You can certainly have a different philosophy but to trash everything just because it came from NaMo's mouth is immature and childish.

Ket PM show  PAK its deserving place ie a terrorist Nation without any democatic Governance.<br/>
Mr. Iyer quietly forgooten his good-ups while he was a IFS offficer ie just by pushing notes and files and undertaken foreign tours to buy his toiletries.

At this age and with lot of vocabulary I expect you to put it for good use.

Accept it and please spare NDA govt with ur wild thoughts suggestions and accusations for few years and then comment. You got enough years to solve the problem it didn't go anywhere now give ur opposition fare chance with the policy they are adopting. Don't worry in worst case we will be back to square one but again we will know at least a different policy didn't work. Stop being hypocritical and behave and show some intelligence here.

                            Once again  much for the discomfort  of ruling alliance Mani Shankar Aiyar has revealed the below ordinary doing of Modi &amp; co..Congratulations for superb write up.Only wise, intelligent and nationalist people can appreciate.<br/>
    Quickfix solution was desired but required home work was missing. Modi's autocratic style of functioning is to blame. Impasse is inevitable. Pakistan's N.S.A. statement that Pakistan is nuclear power and knows how to defend itself, is a indication of Pakistan's future course of action.<br/>
Much for the joy of Pakistan, India has minimized option for reconciliation. Pakistan's atom bomb is more a deterrent to India than India's to Pakistan is a perception which Pakistan wants to persist with.Pakistan's this ploy to escalate tension to the extent that international community intervene is next step of this Modi driven debacle of diplomacy. Modi should avoid handle foreign policy autocratically and take expert opinion in these highly super specialised subjects. Modi's this approach to achieve single handedly without consulting foreign office and foreign minister has made this debacle possible. Now, when Modi has snatched diplomatic defeat from jaws of victory, he should learn lesson and improve to become inclusive and Democratic.

                            Here is the Oxbridge Fraternities loose mouthed "Pseudo Intellectual".<br/><br/>
The Foreign Policy vis-a-vis Kashmir is a debacle of Congress days.  Why did they let the Pakis meet Hurriyat in the past...They were used to our attitude.  This was the first time Kashmir was not discussed at international level.  Else, every-time India Pakistan talk-They have Kashmir on agenda...but this time we took an aggressive stand (albeit delayed) but was worth it.<br/><br/>
Whats happening in FATA; west of Pakistan and Af-Pak relations; could Congress turn the tide if they were in power.  They could not as they would be busy looting our country.  And look how the government turned the crisis again into opportunity by getting Afghan President "change sides" and be with India.  <br/><br/>
The "best agreements" have happened when Congress was in power-Shimla Agreement; The Composite Dialogue and so on.  But the situation did not change on ground...Pakistan had declared a war against India through means of Jihad and none of the agreements have done any benefit.  <br/><br/>
So before running his mouth the "Pseudo Intellectual" should look at the legacy that has been inherited-thanks to his party and thanks to his generation.

                            Kashmir problem is the gift of Nehru to India... All other states Including Nizam joined INdian union thanks to Sardar Patel.. Nehru retained Kashmir to resolve himself and look what a mess he created. in the last 65 yrs despite licking pak (a policy which paki are used to) no solution was found and trillions of dollars (not rupees) have been spent over the years.. the money could have been used for development in both pak and India.. but there are vested interests which are represented by Mani and his communist and congressi click.. so when Modi is taking a different stand they feel their interest is threatened so they will put all rubbish on Modi whenever they can by twisting facts...

What could we achieve by following the policy which Mr. Mani is enamoured of; 3 wars, and still he is criticizing if something new is tried out. he should not forget there is difference in the thoughts and thinking of congress and BJP as far as the Pakistan is concerned.Just Wait and watch what Modi will do to these parasite Hurriat leaders fed by congress and the people like Mani.

This is a huge shift. Any Govt would have atleast accepted composite talks which includes Kashmir. So the present Govt not only traveled from Negative territory of CON  to ZERO(status quo), they tilted the table and traveled in the positive territory and this moron thinks they don't know how to run the foreign policy?

                            I pity the BJP which has created this bunch of ideots who can hardly even read an artice much less appreciate and analyze. Things are judged by the result achieved. What has India achieved from this whole exercise - nothing. There is no doubt the draft statement though vague was still loaded in favor of India. We should have been diplomatically clever enough to let Pakistan scuttle the talks but should have seen them happen. We failed. It is the arrogance, lack of any diplomatic skill and the habit of self-promotion, back patting and crowing his achievement that Modi and his main adviser Doval spoiled the chances. Sushma is being treated as a door mat. She is the only one with huge political experience and yet she is being side lined. A mediocre level police office is now running the foreign policy while the Foregn Office is being relegated in the back ground. Modi has neither any qualification or aptitude for Foreign policy and yet to claim a credit for himself he is making relations with neighbor impossible to sustain.
