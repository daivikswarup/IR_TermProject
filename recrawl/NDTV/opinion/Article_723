Headline::::AAP Won Delhi. You Didn't, LG Jung



DateTime::::2015-07-24T14:29:00+05:30




                                Till recently, I had not met Najeeb Jung, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi. I was pleasantly surprised to see a different person from what I had expected - a man who loves his coffee strong, and enjoys welcoming his guests with a similar brew. He has a lovely cat that likes to sleep on the table where you are seated in his office. He is an extremely polite person, and his English, laced with Urdu, is impeccable. He comes across as a supremely well-mannered man, but the very next day, when I read the newspaper or switch on the TV, I see an entirely different person. When I hear that he has written a letter to the Delhi Chief Minister claiming that he, and only he is the government of Delhi, then I am reminded of his coffee with the cat. 
During our meeting, he gifted me his collection of articles and greatly appreciated my recent book on the 2014 elections. I have also been told that he had earlier taught at Oxford University. So I have no reason to believe that he is naive about constitutional definitions and their broader understanding. So as tough as it is to believe that he wrote a letter declaring the appointment of the Chairperson of the Delhi Commission of Women null and void, while at the same time saying his office amounts to the government of Delhi, the letter is a fact.
As a student of history and politics who has recently finished reading the biographies of Mao Tse Tung and Hitler, this statement does not look bizarre to me. There comes a time in history when leaders appear to hallucinate on their power, and this confusion between dream and reality appears both tragic and farcical. Can you believe that when there is democracy in India, when an election has just concluded in Delhi, when AAP has won 67 seats out of 70, the same context produces a constitutional functionary who says "ONLY I AM THE GOVERNMENT"?
But this is true. And it raises certain fundamental questions. The bigger one is whether India is turning into a constitutional dictatorship where a duly-elected government is not allowed to function and choose its own officers. Everybody knows Arvind Kejriwal is the democratically elected Chief Minister of Delhi, and Najeeb Jung is an appointed functionary who holds a little more than a ceremonial post. In a functioning democracy, in a people's democracy, it's always the elected leader who has earned the power to rule on behalf of the people, and if such a leader flounders, then he or she has to ultimately face the people and be booted out. It's called elections. An appointed functionary, on the other hand, is accountable to the person who appoints him, not to the people, and such a person can't be allowed to say that I AM THE GOVERNMENT. This is not democratic and this is not good for the Indian people. Mao and Hitler used to say they equaled government and we know how that turned out. We will not allow that in Delhi.
Mrs Indira Gandhi used to believe that she was the government and her cronies used to say, "India is Indira, and Indira is India". She, in her deluded state, imposed the Emergency, but finally, she also had to take a democratic route to seek legitimacy for her act, and the people of India punished her and rejected the Congress, which, till then, seemed incapable of losing an election. Indira Gandhi lost her own election in Rae Bareilly. This is the beauty of the democracy; it does not let anyone feel that he or she is bigger than the people. Unfortunately, Najeeb Jung is not an elected representative and does not have to contest elections, so he can continue in his seat as long as the central government desires. 
Which is why he is not his own master. He is being controlled by those who have no faith in democracy. For such people, democracy is a facilitator, a tool which is used by them and their ideologies to function, flourish and reach the top; and once they reach the pinnacle, they destroy democracy. The question is should it be allowed to happen? Today I want to remind Mr. Jung about the great 'revolutionary' Bukharin and his letter to Stalin before he died: "I was at your place, and you said to me: do you know why I consider you my friend? After all, you are not capable of intrigues, are you? And I said: no I am not." This letter was written by Bukharin when he was arrested by Stalin and death was looming upon him.
Niall Ferguson writes, "Bukharin had pleaded to be allowed to go to exile in the United States, or to be sent to a labour camp in Siberia, or at least to be allowed to drink poison rather than be shot." And you know what Stalin did to his 'friend' - he got Bukharin to be shot by a firing squad on March 14, 1938. And you know why this happened? Because when Stalin was killing other members of his politbureau and cabinet, Bukharin was on his side.

                            The bureaucracy, police, military, judicial systems and the president aren't elected either. Does this mean they are dictatorially grabbing the power?? You very well knew the constitution before running for elections. Why cry and complain now?

                            Mr Ashutosh,<br/>
Narendra Modi gvernment whom you consider dictatorial is in centre and the past affiliation of president of India is congress party. <br/>
Have you ever heard that without getting signed by president any notification has been notified (such notification which needs president consent)?<br/>
Or you think BJP government should not consult president on any matter because president has not been directly elected by people of the country?<br/>
One more point there are three MLAs in Delhi from BJP, it means the people of those three constituencies did not elect your party. Should not there AAP avoid governing?<br/>
Mr. Anarchist, you are talking about constitution, in which constitution you have read that file should not be sent to LG for his consent only because Kejriwal is elected government.<br/><br/>
The policy what you talk about is against the basic structure of Constitution, you are not following the precedent and procedure.<br/><br/>
When you were on road and Sheila Dixit was chief minister, you used to tell that this is only Excuse that Delhi police is not in her hand, chief minister can work even police is not in her hand. Now you are giving same excuse.<br/>
Please stop doing these blame game, come in the society of Delhi, you will find that people are facing huge electricity cut.<br/>
DO not try to fool the people do some work please.

                            Mr Ashutosh, is totally wrong in his assessment of the situation. This impasse is wanton creation of Mr Arvind Kejriwal, who has scant respect for rule of law. In Indian democracy, it is only constitution which is supreme. The delhi governments both of BJP with centre under Congress Party &amp; Congress with NDA have ruled from 1993 till 2014 with certain constraints but with restraint of conduct &amp; behaviouralso.<br/><br/>
Mr Kejriwal on the other hand has started his works as if he is the only truly elected representative and since he has been elected with thumping majority , he will throw all the rules, conventions to wind and only his whims and fancy will prevail, since people have voted him with huge majority.  in any case of Huge majority or two thirds majority or simple majority , Conventions, rules and constitution only will prevail. Huge majority does not mean licence to call names , accuse any body with whom your approach is not in agreement of being dictator or corrupt. <br/><br/>
Huge majority unfortunately has gone into kejriwal's head and resultant behaviour. This is a dangerous cocktail and my appeal to Mr Asutosh &amp; others in AAP is to exercise caution in public behaviour and allwing your performance to speak  in place of vulgar advertisement at public cost.

                            Ashutosh, did you win an election? Or has any SC/HC or any judge win an election, or CVC/ECE etc wins an election. Forget it, has your swati (AAP appointed DCW chief) win an election. Dear ashutosh these are constitutional post and need to be respected/at least adhered to unless changed by constitution it-self.

                            Mr. Ashutosh, why to blame LG only. Kejriwal is always ready to lock his horns knowing very well that every matter can be done with the consent of LG. But he always confront with LG. He himself has said that he is anarchist. He is fulfilling his ambition by putting Delhi on edge and taking cover of the people like you. You too were a very good ANCHOR on TV but now what you are? Think yourself.

                            Winning Delhi did not confer on Kejriwal the mantle of dictatorship which he has assumed. If there is a Constitutional authority with some powers vested in him overseeing the Delhi Government, you either simply follow the rules regarding those powers or, if you disagree, challenge them in court. You cannot assume powers that do not exist merely because you have been voted by the people. This is like so many politicians justifying corruption and other crimes winning an election and claiming that the 'Janta' has given them a clean chit.

LG is a constitutional position. The LG is nominated by the Cabinet and PRESIDENT.<br/>
The Cabinet and president is elected by the WHOLE NATION. Whatever the PM, LG, President is doing is within the frame of the Indian constitution. If you disagree, raise a PIL / apeeal in the court. Btw, you already met the President.<br/><br/>
Delhi win has gone into the head of AAP. <br/><br/>

BJP's % vote share was 32 yet it got 3 seats only!What is needed from leaders of AAP is a realistic appreciation of ground realities only!Their flights due to their "thematic appercetions"would end in forced landing only!

                            Everybody is like Mr.Jung different personalities in person and different in profession. I hope Mr. Kejriwal is also the same else his family and friends must be having tough time with him because of his agitating attitude or may he is different that can be seen in his resume of being shunted or left every task he has taken in life be it with TATAs or IRS or IAC or Anna or Delhi 49days CM. Same applies to Ashutosh also ealier his signature said that he challenged Kapil Sibal and Dr.Harshvardhan (Now removed) instead of lost by big margin at Chandni Chowk to Dr. Harshvardhan. Now coming to other parts of his article again going back to his boss style He belives in use n throw like he had thrown Anna,SB,PB,YY (Sale'Kamine) for his personal gains he had even used the name of PM to get votes in Delhi election "Modi for India and Kejriwal for Delhi" advertisement on AAP website. AAP got a speciality of hitting under the belt to cover up it's own incapabilities.

                            Nobody's siding with Jung. But remember, I voted for the ideals and principles AAP stood for Mr. Gupta. We didn't vote for a crying, scheming cretins like you.

AAP is misguiding the people and so is you. AAP is good party but seems to worse than all politician we have ever seen. <br/><br/>
67 seats made AAP too proud and hence the cup is flowing with nonsense ...like idiots, thulla...insulting words. <br/><br/>
Now it is well known ...AAP power hungry than all the political parties in India,....shame on you<br/><br/>

                            AAP a party of megalomaniacs. Started by an individual high on drama, zero on delivery. Publicity getting is his game. Since the start of his career, Kejriwal, almost certainly runs from everything. From Mother Teresa, then to TATA Steel, did not get through in IAS, then IRS (WHERE HE STOPPED ALL HIS POSTINGS THROUGH INFLUENCE), then abandoned Anna Hazare, abandoned Delhi first time so he could become PM, now in Delhi as CM - but name only. His real objective is anarchy throughout India.

                            Ashutosh!As per Indian Constitution,in 29 states the elected leader of the majority party becomes CM and the Governor is appointed by the President of the Republic!In the Five out of 7 UNION TERRITORIES -there is NO legislative Assembly or CM !They are ruled by Administrators appointed by President.In Puducherry thereis an Assembly with 30 MLAs and one CM,but the UT is ruled by a Lt.Governor appointed by the President! Delhi being the National Capital with "peculiarities of its own';it is styled as "National Capital Territory"(Mind you NOT a STATE)!It has 70 MLAS and one CM.Lt. Governor appointed by President!He is virtually the ruler of NCT-Delhi on behalf of the President!In most of the national capitals all over the globe,the Lord Mayor is made to govern the territory!So CM of "NCT-Delhi" is equal to CM of Puducherry and not CM of a state like Punjab or UP!A person impelled by "the quest of greatness" should apply maximum restraint or else he will never attain it!

                            The winning of 67 out of 70 seats in "National Capital Territory- Delhi Assembly Election in 2015" has led AAP leaders to ride on "the ninth cloud rather" than face ominous facts!Their percentage of Vote share was 54% only, yet they got 96% of the seats!On the other hand,BJP got 32% Vote share,yet could get only 3 seats or 4% of seats only!Sagacity demands to make a proper "appreciation" of the ground realities &amp; not indulge in fancy flight based on"thematic apperception"!<br/>
Delhi is a "Union Territory" and not a full-fledged State like Haryana or UP!The Lt. Governor appointed by the President of the Republic is virtually the ruler of Delhi on behalf of the President!Further,due to the fact that the Parliament, Secretariat of Central Govt. embassies and others are located in the UT it is named "National Capital Territory"! By no stretch of imagination it couldbe equated with a "State"in India!The massive mandate given to AAP by Delhi electorate was to work under the letter and spirit of the Constitution only!<br/>
If AAP leader presumes that he could fight against the Central Govt. and have his own way, he would be frustrated and people of Delhi would suffer!

Seriously, why don't you explain AAP's statements, Kejriwal's and his candidate maliwal's lies about LG and Jung calling her up to stop her from coming to office? Why not explain Intents of AAP on purposely disrespecting defined process and constitution? Jung is doing what anybody else would have done. Why AAP firstly intentionally not followed protocols and then attacked gentleman at personal level? Why, what was the hidden agenda?<br/><br/>
Now to the core, why not explain selection criteria, process and suitability of Maliwal? Did any favor happened to the wife of Kejriwal's advisor? Was process not followed with a reason?<br/><br/>
Didn't you defend Tomar and kejriwal strongly inspite of Highcourt position, notice to bar council and denials from universities. How credible are your opinion as Reporter and as Minister? Any reasons for strong defence based on lies inspite of knowing truth?

How about explaining Kejriwal's, AAP's and its candidate's lies about LG calling her and stopping her from attending office? How about explaining suitability and selection process for Maliwal? Was qualification that she was a kin? How about explaining why knowingly and intently a disrespect was accorded to a authority constitutionally defined?<br/>
Didn't AAP, Kejriwal and especially you strongly defended Tomar knowingly high court and university positions as well as order? Why kejriwal lied about Tomar that he was not fully informed? I thought all people knew. <br/>
Now you in particular? When are you coming back on TV and going to explain lack of credibility in your reports and in particular reasons why you support lies?

If AK or his sidekick Ashu has a problem with the constitution let him go to HC or SC.......and ask. He has already been snubbed regarding ACB chief. Problem is with 40 lac odd votes that he got AK and sidekicks have started thiking that they have won the whole world and feeling that its time to even advise Pres Obama on nuclear deal etc...such is ego of power. He is like a young hero who had his first film a hit, started misbehaving with all directors, producers, seniors, juniors and was shunned for ever. AK will soon be shunned by all

Please give the entire electorate of Delhi a break and get down to some concrete work with tangible results - better public hospital facilities,clean drinking water in schools &amp; clean toilets,monitor attendance of school faculty,take steps to reduce air pollution..<br/>
Let me add here the 54.3% people who voted for you - majority were those who do not want to pay civic amenity bills or property tax AND pavement - "patri" [cart] street food stalls,shop keepers who each working day encroach upon over 50% of roads,slowing vehicle traffic to a snails pace and adding to air pollution and who were thus afraid of Kiran Bedi.Face this fact you sorry lot ...

                            Typical bhakt response is a tyrannical "you new about this before contesting. Why complain now". <br/>
The point is that the people of Delhi new that the Central govt had control of police &amp; land matters while Delhi govt had control over other departments including services i.e. (transfer &amp; postings) but with a recent notification, the Central govt has taken control of transfer &amp; postings thus undermining a democratically elected govt. This is something nobody was aware of or expected, least of all - the AAP govt. <br/><br/>
The notification is tantamount to usurping power through the back door by a defeated adversary. It is a subversion of the democratic political will of the people. The retrograde notification has taken Delhi back to the early 20th century British Raj as envisaged by the Government of India Act, 1919 when elected Indian representatives had power over sanitation &amp; education only while all other important portfolios were controlled by civil servants appointed by the British.

                            The comments below are most pathetic. Police, military and the bureaucracy are controlled by the elected governments. Judiciary doesn't run the country. What AAP is 'crying and complaining' about is the highhandedness of the Lt Governor, at the behest of Modi sarkar, and not allowing the duly elected government in Delhi to function with full authority. The APP victory in Delhi has jolted the Modi sarkar and now they are trying to take revenge against the people of Delhi. People of India must speak with one voice against dictatorial tendencies.

This is a democracy not a dictatorship.   English left and made LG Jung in charge! this is how he feels.

                            True said, it is democracy, if the people of Delhi has chosen Kejriwal as Government then LG is not eligible to govern as he has not appoint by people he was appointed by UPA (then government in Centre ). If Modi ji (BJP) and Congress enjoying this (spat between Kejri &amp; LG) then I think it will give more popularity and power to AAP. BJP &amp; Congress is not doing anything except Backbiting and wasting the peoples money and government time.

                            Ashutosh is right. It is AAP who won Delhi Municipality (with a pseudo name State). They should play that role of offering better municipal services for Delhi and let LG discharge his constituitonal  responsibilities of personnel as well as policing. No point trying to reach out for responsibilities that does not belong to AAP government in Delhi.

                            AAP may have won Delhi, but unfortunately for Dilli wallas, it was a hollow victory. For since your victory all Dilli has experienced in chaos, no bijli, no paani, no security, no security cameras, no free wi-fi, no new schools, no new colleges. Dilli has experienced a lot of verbal garbage from AAP and ZERO action.

                            What a Joke! AAP (including yourself Ashutosh) have fooled the people of this country by your cheap antics. Do you think the people of this country are stupid? Or are you or AAP taking them for granted? <br/><br/>
You should feel terribly sorry for yourself for making such ridiculous comments. <br/><br/>
You (including AAP) have ruined Delhi and will continue to do so, until you people are either kicked out of power or taught a be-fitting lesson by the people of this country.<br/><br/>
Your AAP, including you have a made a complete MOCKERY of the people of Delhi. <br/><br/>
You never deserved to be elected to power. But since the people of Delhi have made this TERRIBLE mistake, they have to suffer the consequences also. Grow up and bring more mature conversations to the table, AAP is the most INCOMPETENT set of fools, with a Joker as its head of the party.

                            Honestly NDTV needs to stop Ashutosh's articles going forward, this is very biased, he gives the impression that everything Kejeriwal and AAP does is good. That's absurd to me.

                            Delhi did not vote for you for fighting everyone else, spending Rs 512 crores on your Khokhli publicity, not paying salaries to it's staff etc etc., and doing nothing good for the city state.<br/>
You have made a mockery of the entire political system of the country. Aal election honge to public Joota bhi nahi maregi.

                            India is a constitutional democracy and it does not run like a Mohalla Sabha, where elected representatives have no check on them. The constitutional head of Delhi is LT Governor.The fact remains.

                            People of Delhi have elected you as their servant, and not a ruler. Please behave like a servant and follow the instructions of people of Delhi. Stop dictating.
