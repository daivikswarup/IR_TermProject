Headline::::In Year One, Modi Has Repositioned India



DateTime::::2015-05-15T23:56:00+05:30




                                In Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, the Red Queen remarked, "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to stay in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that". This has relevance in evaluating Modi's first anniversary. It was true in relation to meeting the ever-rising curve of expectations both during his electoral campaign, but more so for his first year in office. As we enter the week of Modi's first anniversary, the question in everybody's mind is whether expectations have been met, and what would be an acceptable methodology to evaluate the government's first year's performance.
Modi, for one, has never believed that the future can ever be a hostage of the past. Nonetheless, the quagmire of legacy issues circumscribe flexibility. The dominant legacy issue relates to the pervasive culture and mindset of entitlements instead of outcomes. This entitlement culture characterised the 10 years of UPA-I and UPA-II like the right to compulsory education, the right to food security and guaranteed employment. There was little focus on outcomes, inadequacy of preparedness or implementational infirmities. Illustratively, the right to compulsory education guarantees access, but has poor outcomes. Latest surveys like the ASER (Annual Status of Education Report 2014) suggest sharp declining outcomes where a class 5 student cannot meet basic requirements expected from even a class 2 student.
Additionally, the entitlement mindset resulted in unsustainable fiscal profligacy which weakened our macro fundamentals. This, coupled with governance paralysis, repetitive scams, crippled by a duality of power centres increasingly emasculated the Prime Minister's Office.
Then, weak macro fundamentals slowed growth rates down to sub 5%, (under the old methodology), an unsustainable Current Account Deficit, rising inflation and reticent investor sentiment.
In sharp contrast, a year down the line, significant upturns are obvious. A reassertion of the governance rubric, decisive political leadership, an empowered bureaucracy, the breaking of silos between agencies and government.
Look at the restoration of macro fundamentals: even under the erstwhile methodology, GDP has accelerated from sub 5% to 5.7%, while under the new system, growth this year is expected to be between 8-8.5%. Current Account Deficit is down to a modest 1.6%, with subdued inflationary pressures and WPI inflation figures in the negative, and greater preparedness to meet exogenous uncertainties.
Multiple measures have been taken to improve the competitiveness of the Indian economy by reducing the onerousness of labour law compliance, encouraging state governments in initiatives to modernise labour regulations, faster environment clearances, and minimizing the impact of the earlier Land Acquisition Act (although this is still work in progress).
The Medium Term fiscal outlook remains healthy with rationalisation of subsidies over petroleum products, additionality of resources through auctioning coal and spectrum, and improving the efficiency of infrastructure through large public outlays, particularly in highways, roads and power. Barriers to foreign investment have been substantially diluted with opening the sectors of insurance, pension, defence and railways for private investment, both domestic and foreign.
Social inclusion, which benefits the underprivileged and the agricultural sector has received focused attention. Insurance schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, and the pension scheme Atal Pension Yojana create the framework for an acceptable system targeting the underprivileged.
Jan Dhan and Digital India and Aadhaar will enable a faster pace of financial inclusion while improving the reach of Anti-Poverty programmes. The Swachh Bharat campaign will motivate improved environment, hygiene and mind-set changes.
Skill India coupled with Digital India enhances competitive manufacturing. However, its success is contingent on fulfilling regulatory changes in labour law applications, land acquisition, more reliable infrastructure and ease of doing business.
There are three other issues which deserve some comment:
First, the broad issue of centre-state relations: the acceptance of the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission enhances devolution to States from 32 to 42 percent. This is a decisive move. It devolves not only higher resources, but meets the persistent demands of the States in seeking greater flexibility in the deployment of resources. Some states have been critical that the resources in respect of Centrally Sponsored Schemes and many other schemes funded through central outlays have diminished. This was inevitable. Higher devolution to states shrunk the envelope of the central government. After all, you cannot have the cake and eat it too. The critics also commit the error of comparing BE (Budget Estimates) of 2013-14 with the BE of this year. This is flawed. One must compare RE (Revised Estimates) with BE.
Second, has Modi concentrated excessively on foreign policy? Has the domestic constituency been neglected? In an increasingly interdependent world, and in a milieu where India had fallen off the global investor radar, special efforts were needed. Modi's extraordinary leadership in forging new compacts and partnership with not only the more developed countries, but many other countries, has been an extraordinary story of repositioning India. No other Prime Minister had realized, much less harnessed, the growing political clout and power of a resurgent Diaspora.
Third, has Modi's style of governance sought to micromanage? Is there an excessive concentration of decision-making in the Prime Minister's Office? Have the role of line ministries been sidelined? Having worked with Prime Minister Vajpayee as his secretary, I must confess that the PMO reflects the style of the Prime Minister. It is ironic that for the last 10 years, a non-existent PMO was the common refrain. There is now talk of an over-zealous PMO. Modi is deeply conscious that the people of India have invested their trust and confidence in his leadership. Equally, in his ability to implement and deliver. The functioning of the PMO reflects this consciousness.
There is a huge unfinished agenda:
- Ensuring faster implementation on the ground, freeing of stranded assets, ensuring optimum outcomes from large borrowings with sovereign guarantees particularly for roads and railways, and coherent coordination among ministries and with States.
- Adherence to the revised path of fiscal consolidation may entail difficult decisions on recalibrating subsidies, particularly if exogenous variables deteriorate or oil prices rise sharply.
- Managing inter-institutional cooperation between regulatory entities like RBI and the Finance Ministry needs candour and imagination. The RBI Governor would be the first to concede that the central bank needs major reforms, and monetary policy must sub-serve the larger objective of growth.
- Closely monitoring the implementation of several budgetary commitments, particularly legislative changes like a Bankruptcy Code, Alternate Dispute Redressal mechanism, several other financial sector legislations or making the tax regime genuinely non-adversarial. Moving towards competitive tax rates and more importantly, a framework which benchmarks practices with other Asian countries and best international practice deserves priority.
- Finally, recognizing the absence of the government's majority in the Rajya Sabha, and forging alliances and partnerships need negotiating acumen to secure key reform legislations.
Fortunately, both the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister need no advice and lessons to achieve this elusive but realisable objective.
There is overwhelming consensus that the Modi regime has run fast and faster, but may have to do so twice as fast to make a decisive and more visible difference in our life quality. Known to be an outperformer, he is India's best bet to meet the rising expectation curve of our young population. That is why Modi matters. And matters a great deal.(NK Singh is a member of the BJP, former MP (Rajya Sabha), has held key bureaucratic assignments and has been a member of the Planning Commission.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Whatever one may say, Modi has tried hard. There is no doubting his desire to help India rise up. One person alone cannot do it and instead of playing a blame game, let us all get involved and do what we can for India. At the very least let us join the clean India campaign.

                            Very well written note. I am an NRI and have closely followed what Modi's Government has done over the year. The reality is that the world has started to look at India "differently" (in a positive way). And that makes me a very proud Indian. It is for Indians in India to start acknowledging  the strength of this Government and stand by them rather than simply pulling it down.

We have seen 60 years of congress corrupt incompetent governments. BJP has only had 6 years in total between AB Vajpee and Modi so who takes the majority of the blame for country's poverty, poor infrastructure and agrarian distress?

                            Modi administration looks more evolutionary than revolutionary. To some extent it is understandable - we are large country, federalism is ingrained in our system, government doesn't have majority in RS etc etc. <br/><br/>
However there are two other issues - <br/><br/>
1. A lack of vision for inclusiveness in growth, and <br/>
2. Chasing of shiny objects over more thorny issues<br/><br/>
To cite an example, the bullet train priority is so misplaced and shows a lack of understanding of common mans problems traveling in sleeper class or 2nd class or suburban trains. <br/><br/>
Ultimately this government will be judged based on 3 tall goals they have set.<br/><br/>
 1. Electricity in all villages by 2019<br/>
 2. Toilets in all homes by 2020 (?)<br/>
 3. Housing for all by 2022 (?)<br/><br/>
If he delivers even 80% of those goals, he would have changed the country for good. Right now it doesn't look like any of these are going to be achieved. Let's wait and see.

                            Lol. Modi Bhakts are having a field day praising an article written about a party by the same party. Oh the irony! For the informed, let me enlighten you on the background of the author:<br/><br/>
In 2010, BJP's Arun Shourie claimed that one of the conversations in the Nira Radia tapes could involve NK Singh. He alleged that the order of the speakers in the Rajya Sabha was changed to give an edge on retroactive tax rebates to Reliance Industries. Singh said his conversation was a "social informal chat" in the wider interest of India's energy which had no bearing on a policy issue.<br/><br/>
Yeah sure, we believe you that you didn't talk anything about policy especially when you have been involved in so many policy making positions:<br/><br/>
Member, State Secretariat, Finance Department (1968–69)<br/>
Under Secretary, Ministry of Commerce (1969–73)<br/>
Special Assistant to Commerce Minister (1973–77)<br/>
Represented India at GATT, UNACTD, UN and the Common Wealth Secretariat.<br/>
Chairman, Bihar State Electricity Board<br/>
Special Assistant to the current President Pranab Mukherjee, then former Minister of Commerce, Steel and Mines (1980–81)<br/>
First Minister, Economic and Commercial, Indian Embassy, Japan (1981–85)<br/>
Additional Finance Commissioner, Principal Secretary Industries and Industrial Development Commissioner, Bihar (1986–90)<br/>
Joint Secretary Police (Ministry of Home Affairs) (1990–91)<br/>
Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (Ministry of Finance) (1991–93)<br/>
First Chairman UNGEF (United Nations Global Environment Facility) (1993–94)<br/>
Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (1993–95)<br/>
Secretary, Department of Expenditure (1995–96)<br/>
Revenue Secretary (1996–98)<br/>
Secretary to former PM AB Vajpayee (1998-2001)<br/>
Member Planning Commission (2001–14)<br/>
Deputy Chairman, Bihar State Planning Board (2006–08)<br/>
Member of Parliament to the Rajya Sabha (2008–14)<br/><br/>
Your article is devoid of any facts and like Modi is based on giving false hope and feel good factor. While everyone should stand up on their own feet, Your capitalist arrogance shows when you say that the people feel entitled. Let me remind you again that the job of a government is to take care of its people rather than give away freebies like land, natural resources, tax cuts to corporates. What is even more hillarious is that you are claiming that schemes like PM suraksha bima is Modi's invention when they are nothing but renamed UPA schemes and your claim that Modi introduced social inclusion is a good joke. Your outright rejection of the top economists claim that the New GDP formula is mysterious is immature especially when stating the solution as a one pointer. All the other economists are not fools. Oh but there are enough fools here who'll keep clapping at your article because at the end of the day they do not think for themselves hence they are rightly called Bhakts!

                            The point elucidated by Mr Singh are in fact reflective of what most people who are aware of happenings. What people forget is that Modi has not only to retrograde what the UPA2 did but also change mindset. Bringing in control, change of mindset and accountability is the biggest challenge. His outlook is most positive and accompanied by a 'Never Give Up' attitude, he is bound to succeed. Let's not forget, it's a nation of 1.2 billion and changes will take their time to be visible. Political affinities apart, he is the hope we Indian's have and let's give him a chance to prove his worth.

Left visa issues with US, past issues with china and working to bring in development, through investment. Whats wrong if Modi-Jaitley-shah trio calling the shot. They have shared more with the states, tried to take states on board, worked with a CM like Mamta to get boundary arrangement. I give full marks to Modi Govt.

All these trips will get press coverage and wow factor, but for ground reality to change - modi needs guts to serve people who are illiterate and are too busy to have their day to day needs met to sing praises for him. <br/><br/>
It will be a thankless job for those serving poor people who do not have access to Twitter, media and Internet. So we can for now live with illusion of progress and wait for four years and open our eyes and see if India has really changed.

                            In early Y2001-02, the post Kargil NDA government was at its low, SP was also riding an anti incumbency in UP,  Narendra Modi was new to Gujarat CM, not very popular then and their main rival Congress won Vadodara assembly  by-elections defeating BJP convincingly. All was not well for Vajpayee led NDA, SP in UP and BJP in Gujarat and then suddenly happened Godhra-2002. After this both BJP and SP returns back to their high in their respective states defeating Congress out of polarization by end of Y2002 and Modi who did development in Gujarat but orchestrated with hero of development for continuous three terms, SP and family ruling still enjoying power in UP though UP has become powerless  and BJP won general election of 2014. <br/>
Whenever people shed their religious &amp; caste boundaries and return back to Congress, then communal/castist politicians join hands to defeat congress.  Communal forces hates congress because they cannot see or digest why communities are growing (or has grown )with Congress. They want to snatch the good things which Congress has done for all the masses in the country.<br/>
But time always teaches great lessons. The arrival of AAP &amp; Arvind Kejrewal has demonstrated that Modi's BJP can be defeated during its peak and prime time. An IIT graduate/IAS from humble simple middle class family from Ghaziabad can defeat Modi's RSSBJP, winning 55% popular votes, which includes votes from all. This is the best thing happened in last one year, the arrival of Arvind Kejrewal and Resurrection of Congress at national level.

When confronted with these questions, BJP members claim they have done lot of things, they refuse to accept that more has to be done to meet their election promises. We don't say things will change in one year, but at least BJP ministers should stop false propaganda, else what is the difference between other govt and BJP?

                            To the writer..... How much did you lick Feku Modis boot? People of India are not fools. We know how bluffed the India people and still bluffing. In his tour to China how much did he achieved? Be honest. My answer will be nil full zero. We are reading that he made 22 billion dollars contract but it is all lie and nothing else. So long we will this guy the more the crap we will get.

                            Modi made sure congress and gandhi's  are done with. By next general election most so called congress leaders will be representing BJP. Under Modi leadership India has established herself as nation to be looked upto by rest of the world. Indians should be proud.

                            Can we actually/safely say that we have delivered something to the people of India? We certainly have delivered speeches which are famousized by corporate sponsored media. How can the rest of the world trust us when the UN tells them that this is a country where millions of farmers commit suicides. How can we make an impact in the world if we cannot help those who want to make their living by providing food on other people's table but cant feed their own ? What should we prioritize as a nation ?

                            For me, it is plain and simple (unlike the ultra complicated and difficult to understand write up from NK Singh):<br/>
I was never interested in Indian politics and Modi's dynamism and hard work has inspired me to be interested in my country again. It was high time that someone smart and confident started networking with leaders of other country, he did that. His straightforwardness has made the world take notice of India again, investments will come. He is being ambitious for us, the sky is the limit. Wake up and do your bit.<br/><br/>
Say what you want, this is politics and negative people will only be critical. God bless them.

                            Positioning India is one thing and change on the ground is another. Common man continues to struggle with the situation of indifference. Common man is never considered in the equation. One can only hope that with every five year term the govt is elected, common man shall be benefited. Budget after budget, we have disappointment, no matter what this article says, it just says and talks about feel good factor.

                            Can we actually/safely say that we have delivered something to the people of India? We certainly have delivered stellar speeches which are all over the media. But... How can the rest of the world trust us when the UN tells them that this is a country where millions of farmers commit suicides and yet has alarmingly high number of dollar billionaires in top 100. How can we make an impact in the world if we cannot help a farmer who want to make his living by providing food on other people's table but cant feed their own ? What should we prioritize as a nation ?

                            सबुरी और श्रध्दा जरूरी है. Everybody knows it is not going to be a miracle except for the impatient critics. After long time this country has found a honest and sincere PM who cares for the country. The foundation is being laid now and the visible gains will show up in next 10-20 years.

                            Hey Guys... I believe everyone would agree that in last 1 year the GOI was successful in checking corruption at high levels and was able to keep it at bay. For this, congress is saying that it's just one year in office and let us wait, in the next 4 years this Govt will falter and will be drenched under the rain of corruption (as they were in their own previous UPA regimes). However, in case of reforms or progressive initiatives of the govt. in last one year the same Congress is crying for immediate results. Four years is too long for them to wait. Congress is getting anxious and is yearning for something wrong to happen. CONGRESS, PLEASE STOP WHINING!!<br/><br/><br/>
I also see many people feeling upset and angry for not receiving Rs. 15 Lacs in their personal account as allegedly promised by PM during pre-poll rally while speaking on Black Money stashed overseas. GUYS PLEASE.. TAKE A BREAK! DID YOU REALLY EXPECT THAT UPON RETREIVAL OF BLACK MONEY YOU GUYS WILL BE REWARD WITH 15 LACS (i.e. YOUR HARD EARNED SHARE OF THE TOTAL BLACK MONEY) INTO YOUR SAVINGS ACCOUNT?? DID YOU VOTE FOR THIS GOVT EXPECTING 15 LACS?? I hope you guys are not really that dumb. On a lighter note, I'm very much interested in knowing what would be the most convenient mode for you guys for the effecting the transfer of 15 lacs to you personal account when the amount is retrieved from foreign banks. Would you prefer cash or check or NEFT, RTGS, etc????? LOL ;-)

                            This is nothing but an opinion,propaganda piece by a BJP mouthpiece. Take it for what it is. But it sure seems to have excited the saffron flock into believing every little move Modi makes is contributing exponentially and directly to the great ness of India. Unfortunately a lot of desperately hopeful Indians are looking to this man to lead them to the promised land so they hungrily devour every morsel of hype thrown at them. Well fortunately you cannot fool All of the people All of the time. In 4 years the results will be there for all to see and I will be hoping this man and his cohorts will be kicked out of office without causing irreparable harm to the fabric of India.Jai Hind!
