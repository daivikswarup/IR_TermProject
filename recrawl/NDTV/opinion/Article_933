Headline::::Aamir Goes From Hero No. 1 to Villain No. 1



DateTime::::2015-11-25T04:32:00+05:30




                                Trust the French to come up with a saucy saying like "Cherchez La Femme". Since it defies a literal translation - "Search the woman" - let's just say it states little but covers everything!
When Aamir Khan put both sneakers into his mouth at the Ramnath Goenka Awards' night, he established a few things about himself and his marriage: now it's official - Kiran's the boss! Unfortunately, with this particular incident, she has also become the fall guy or fall gal. Imagine! Kiran was converted into an instant vamp in a poorly-scripted (so, not her husband's, and not her own) Bollywood film. All because of a private miya-bibi conversation that was made public by the hubby. Perhaps it was a slip of the tongue. An inadvertent remark. Which in itself is pretty unusual for Aamir. Here's one "thinking actor" who rarely utters a word that has not been pre-decided. He possesses one of the most intelligent minds in Bollywood - about that there is no dispute. Compared to the other two far more volatile Khans (Shah Rukh and Salman), Aamir is the cool customer. On an average, he makes one film a year but hey! with that single mega box office hit under his belt, he leaves the movie industry gasping, "How does Aamir do it, yaar?"
The answer is simple: Aamir is bloody smart. He takes risks. He calls the shots. He changes the game. He raises the bar. His positioning in the CSR space has been consistently positive. Critics call him calculating, I think he is brilliant. Public's perception says Aamir stands for something! This is what his ardent admirers always remind doubters. What that "something" is, doesn't matter, doesn't demand definition. He's the actor with a hyper-active conscience. He cares for the poor. He reaches out to the masses. He is selective about the products he endorses. He cries with and for India's downtrodden masses during his hugely-profitable reality shows. True. True. True.
Then comes this bombshell.
Aamir gets massacred for making a provocative comment. But wait a minute. Was it his comment? Nope. It was his wife's. Did he say he agreed with her? Not that we know. Did he endorse his wife's emotional outburst? Privately, maybe. See? Aamir's smart. He merely quoted his wife... he said Kiran was scared for the safety of "her son". Kiran. We don't know whether Aamir was equally scared. Aamir revealed it was Kiran who thought of moving to another country. Kiran. Not him. Kiran was frightened each time she read the headlines in the morning. Kiran was "alarmed". Not him. Aamir is a good husband. Kiran and he share an equal and mutually respectful relationship. That much is pretty obvious. But hello! it was Kiran who made the faux-pas. Not him. But now Aamir is stuck!
I think, for the first time in his life, he tripped up in a public space, which he normally owns. It was a monumental slip up. That's it. A snatch of bedroom conversation which got out inadvertently, that too, in a packed ball room - and then all hell broke loose.
The thing is, we don't make allowances for our celebrities. We are unforgiving and judgmental. One wrong move, one wrong statement and bas! Khel khatam.
The question to ask is whether Kiran really meant what she was quoted as having said. Does she still feel the same? Will both of them feel pushed into a corner, forced to retract, pressurised to apologize? I hope not. This is really so unfortunate. Aamir must be kicking himself. But to taunt him about his "Hindu wife" and keep repeating that nauseating argument about a Muslim superstar in a Hindu country reduces our secular democratic credentials to a particularly indigestible joke. I have been reading the trolls and cringing at the pathetically low level of criticism. Venomous remarks say more about the persons spewing venom than about their target.
Is it okay to tell ordinary citizens who are critical of certain government policies to "Go to Pakistan" and leave the country... but not okay for a star to say his wife was deeply concerned about the future of their son... and therefore thought of leaving India?
All it needs is one - just one - unguarded remark in public for a high-profile person's image to come crashing down. People are baying for Aamir's blood right now. On one level, he's lucky! Had a new movie release of his been round the corner, chances are protestors would have pelted theatres and asked viewers to boycott the film. These sort of "protests" are not hard to orchestrate. It's even more shameful when senior film industry colleagues, emboldened by their personal political connections, nastily slam one of their own...that too, as  publicly.
Every citizen has the right to express "alarm". Or feel "despondent". Just wondering whether the reactions to Aamir Khan's candid confessions would have been less vicious had his name been Arun Khanna.
From Hero No.1 to Villain No.1. Overnight.
But trust our Prime Minister Narendra Modi to grab even this opportunity and turn it around. I like it! Aamir Khan and Narendra Modi as roadies. Superhit!! What an idea, Sir-ji!(Shobhaa De is an established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator, who is considered an authority on popular culture.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Try blurting out your comments in Saudi , China North Korea etc , you will understand what intolerance is. Try abusing King or their PM , you will understand what intolerance is. In Saudi you will be stoned to death and in North Korea you will be shredded to pieces by a missile. No I am not exaggerating , North Korean dictator just shredded his military chief with a misile because he fell asleep while watching parade.

                            Dear Shobha, it is not about what Kiran said. If you see complete conversation of Amir, he was endorsing the intolerance brigade which is ridiculous. Why he did not share about any actual incident happened to him which led to him think like that. I am sure he wouldn't find any. He just saying on the perception of very few people. India has given him love always and I am personally find of him always. This will change now.

                            This is pretty much was expected from you, not clear in what you want imply, let's look at from an unbiased view; A) assuming there is present and grave danger to the citizens due to intolerance, then why the so called pseudo-secular outfits, instead propagating peace and harmony they are simply hyping a non-issue based on one or two incidents compared to incidents that had happened during the past regime. B) agreed any killing or hate speech are condemnable, however, these incidents should not be politicized, which is what is exactly happening and to great degree media is also equally responsible for hyping and sensationalizing the issues. C) Modi has been emphasizing on sabh ka sath and sabh ka Vikas and he had been focusing on the development agenda, however, media and the pseudo-secular parties are simply harping on a manufactured intolerance agenda. D) also please take note, it's just not Amir getting bashed it's also the so called BJP fringe elements who have made statements have been criticized and crucified in social media, So I don't thinks it's one sided, the general aam Janatha has been fair in its opinion and bashing, irrespective of who has made or provided irresponsible statements. E) finally, as a very diverse country there will views and opinions which support or opposes both majority and minority community, it does not mean intolerance, so if a leader of the majority community voices his or her views in favor of the majority community, the responsible minority community should come in open and pacify, instead of playing the victim card and same goes to the majority community to come in open and pacify the minorities. Take not appeasement will not work.. It will only create more divide. Hope this message reaches the masses..

                            Its not about if he should go or not... But that if some one is disrespectful enough to his / her homeland to say that we should leave as we have the means and have earned more than enough from here then they should actually leave without doing the drama... there are many sons / daughters of this country sitting in Mumbai trying to get a chance to work in Bollywood industry... if some one will go they will also get a chance to work.....<br/><br/>
I used to watch every movie of him but not at the cost of this... These guys should understand that for every thing they can not blame and do blah blah...<br/><br/>
His movie PK I watched and laughed all the way... but same time as Hindu I know what they have shown and which other religion did they targeted in that movie as much as Hinduism? Please don't say that others don't have any things which you will like to be removed or mentioned when talking about those. Also don't lecture me that should be proud that Hinduism is generous enough to laugh on that movie and take it as entertainment as it has already been proved by the success of PK. And I am proud that Hinduism is generous enough to take anything like PK. That's why I watched that movie laughing and taking it as entertainment...<br/><br/>
For example can Aamir and you tell me why "The Da Vinci Code" was banned in India? And why none cried like this saying that its intolerant. <br/><br/>
They dare not speak any thing in that movie about other religions bcoz in India, secular means if you want to criticize religion then take example of Hinduism all others are like sacred cows so don't utter a word....

You are a literary genius. You have twisted and turned the words to such an effect that will after all prove that Aamir is innocent. We believe that the words were not his and belonged solely to his wife. He is too naive and an imbecile to have uttered the particular sentence only to make a point and that point is Modi is not acceptable as PM.  This is very well truly indicated in the last para of your article.and <br/><br/>
Guys change your mind set. No one in India is running around for the blood of guys of any religion. Let the party rule and you write your books and only books mind you.

Any society will face churning when policies change and that is true when transformation for development takes place.   We can understand if the so called intolerant happenings happened under BJP governments.  All of them under so called sickular folks.  What prevented them from taking action and expose BJP if the so believe.  <br/><br/>
We tend to doubt the whole thing is being orchestrated to bring down Modi govt. and to prove them to be correct.<br/><br/>

                            Quite often Shobha de writes a decent article...unfortunately this is not one of them...incredible that one can get paid for this...but the important point or rather question to Shobha De is that are you actually saying that it is okay for him (or his wife ) to make such a statement? At the same time you also want to slam people for criticising the comment? Don't you think the statement is wrong on so many levels... Do you think that we are in Afghanistan or Syria ? How has Kiran rao and Amit Kian's life changed that they feel scared? These kind of irresponsible statements not only spoil the country's image but lead to fear mongering... Don't you think it is wrong?

                            So what' S wrong with what he said? Ministers, chief ministers and rabble rousing MPs of the ruling party can keep issuing horrendous statements that people either adhere to their views or " go to Pakistan". Amit Shah says Pakistan will celebrate if BJP loses Bihar, essentially saying if you don't vote BJP, you are supporter of Pakistan. It is not the hooligans and occasional incidents that scare thinking people. It is the atmosphere of official support and encouragement from ministers and office bearers of ruling party that are creating the insecurity feeling. They don't apologise. They call you anti national and worse. The trolls have no sense of decency or proportion. India' S image is hurt? Yeah it sure is. Not by Aamir' S statement. Look up yourselves in the mirror BJP Bhakts and see the hatred on your faces and thoughts. That' S what is hurting India' S and Hinduism' S image.

                            Imagine our PM going out in public and talking how intolerant the opposition is and may be make few derogatory comments on you. Everyone will notice.. Each news channel will flash it.. Why? Because PM is looked up to by many... Same thing happened with AK... By expressing himself in a wrong manner. He could have said they are concerned but they are hopeful things will improve.. And I think things are improving. Even if AK did not say this because of his political belief, he has certainly gained support from political parties who are trying very hard to bring down a govt. which is doing so many good things and trying to bring India back on the world map.

                            Aamir Khan is a celebrity. They know the amount of value addition due to their presence (and that's why they charge millions of rupees to show up at any event. Isn't it?). Thus, It is safe to assume that his words carry a thousand time more weight (or effect) than those of us "ordinary Indians". Now, in the light of the above fact, I truly doubt whether it was a candid confession or a well-placed and well-disguised statement (and as you said above that he is damn smart and a very calculated risk taker). I think that with such "statement", Aamir has insulted all of his fans and the rest of the Indians who in their little capacity use every opportunity to ease the tension and safeguard the inclusive nature of the country.<br/>
No, It wouldn't have mattered if the name of the "celebrity" issuing the sentiment was "Arun Khanna". My response to him would have remained the same. If he feels like leaving the country, Please do so immediately. I am an Indian and I know that I have to defend my country from all sorts of elements, all the time. And I will continue to do so till my last breath.

                            Shobha, for some reason, I'd never read any of articles, but the headline here peaked my interest and I gave it a read. Honestly, it's the stupidest argument I've ever heard. If someone says something like, .."I am alarmed at the number of incidents..my wife is scared, even asked me to consider leaving the country etc." it means only one thing. You cannot say "ohh...he merely quoted his wife".He wasn't criticizing her for her statement. He clearly used her statement to further strengthen his earlier statement that he's alarmed at the number of incidents.<br/>
Don't misuse the fact that NDTV lets you publish your 'whatever' articles to talk nonsense.

                            When actors are role models in a country so bereft of role models and who better than Amir Khan, each one of his public statements HAS to be nuanced and measured for repercussions. If this had been a bedroom conversation and there was no obvious endorsement, this statement should never have come out in a public forum. Please spare the PM - do you think he (or even if it was a Congress PM) would have time to pay attention? And also check who was responsible for pushing up this statement in the social media. Our own Pappu?

New buzz is about Intolerance. What is Amir trying to tell? Non Hindu's in India living death fear every day?  His statement just made RSS, Sena to beat the chest and proved their point of non-hindu's commitment. Social issue should be healed not be salted..

This is what happens when a writer used to writing soft porn and celebrity linkups in a Page3 kind of magazine tries to debate the pros &amp; cons of Aamir's foot in the mouth situation. Aamir may be brilliant but all of us were not born yesterday. He is trying to fan the under currents of disenchantment by pseudo-seculars and make it a governance problem. Was Aamir sleeping all these years when we had religious intolerance and mass pogrom by Congress and the terrorists from Pak creating havoc in India ?

                            Shobhaji, you are also smart. I will say something against you quoting that it was my friend who said it. But I will do this in a big forum for the attention of entire world. And I will know the impact. Is this called smartness? <br/><br/>
This is irresponsible act by a celebrity who is worshipped by millions. He has the responsibility to speak with impact in mind. I remember Tamil Superstart Rajanikant stopped smoking on screen as he knows his fans are mad to follow whatever he does. That's called responsibility. We see Amitabh making very careful statements when it comes to public. We see Sachin Tendulkar who clearly made a statement that he is Indian first and than Mumbaikar even though he knew Sivasena doesn't like it when they were trying to divide in the name of Marathi and others. We see respected Kalam sir, asking the Media to contribute more and more positive head lines for the benefit of creating positive culture. There are top influential priests who showed the solidarity by isolating themselves from the anti-nationals in the name of caste and religions. These are the people who carefully behave as a responsible icons.<br/><br/>
I know there are many responsible leaders who used to address the country to stay calm and live together even in real crisis. Where as we see loads of people who are making ridiculous comments when there was not that significant crisis but still blowing up. <br/><br/>
The need of the hour is to see how these powerful people can contribute to make the things improve if there is a need. Not creating a divide among the people with crazy thoughts like not seeing the movies or perhaps not making the movies, asking to go to Pakistan etc which are equally bad.

Poor Rahul had to plod along all these several months with only the 'suit boot ki sarkar' jibe that his aides could offer him. Now he has this 'intolerance'. This will keep the home fires burning for some more time to come until his aides can think of something else equally inane for Rahul.

                            India is intolerant and Mr Aamir Khan stating openly that his wife even expressed a desire to flee the country shouldn't be criticized as it doesn't mean that he is criticizing the BJP or he was being political or taking any sides. He sounds concerned about the social welfare. He is probably more aware and closer to the reality than many of them shaming him and posting negative comments about him. Here are the reasons why India to me personally has been intolerant and all of this are current in 2015 (I have left the country some 10 years ago):<br/><br/>
1) We still have a huge issue of child labor.<br/>
2) We still have issues such as dowry. I would suggest all who are all anti and are opposing him to just try and be a girl in India. If you are a girl, just explain to yourself honestly about how safe you feel to travel after hours or about the women rights itself. <br/>
3) We still have people who are taking sides on the religion without thinking that we are all one.  I know many of them who have sacrificed their relationships because of the religion factor (regardless of Hindu, Muslim or Christian Etc... ). Marry someone outside of religion and caste and show me that you are tolerant. <br/><br/>
These are only few aspects. When he made PK, I felt that all my feelings were aptly presented on the screen. Only thing is that I am not an alien. Given all that I see in the country today sometimes I am discouraged to have any amount of hope.<br/><br/>
Of course, we are slightly better than other regressive countries but we are not really close to being even an average country when it comes to being progressive.

Why Amir and Shahrukh acting action films if they need tolerant persons around them. They should preach ahimsa through their films. We INDIAN know what to accept and what not to. Amir and Shahrukh didn't made INDIA we learned from icons of world , Gandiji, Vallabhbhai Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash chandra bose, Ambedkar, E V Periyar, Anna and not from those who sell these greats and not from those who take advantage from these greats.

Like some south indians say North indians are rough and not polished like them. The thought is true for them but I disagree.<br/><br/>
Living with difference of opinion is true tolerance.<br/><br/>
I do not see tolerance or unbiased atitude of media:  I am not with goons placing someone down in name of religion, however Why the media were quite on 1984 on mass migration of hindus from J&amp;K and Assam. Is is because we are Hindus we have to take the shot and not speak. If we speak we are intolerant.<br/><br/><br/>

                            Its a free country, if Aamir want to get out of the country he is free to do so. No one is begging him to stay. Neither his presence if of any value nor would his absence be felt. Its not a movie where there are many retakes, if aamir thing he is a hero in real life and get away with his film persona, let him walk the talk... I dont really care if he stays or leaves, there are more important problems for this country than a 2 bit sleazy filmstar who is nothing but a attention seekrt

He starts off by saying - "To complete my answer that there is a sense of fear more than there was earlier. I do feel there is a sense of insecurity"...<br/>
And ends with - "You feel depressed, you feel low.. why is it happening? This feeling exists in me too."<br/><br/>
He didn't 'merely quoted his wife'...he shared that sentiment.<br/>

                            Everybody has the right to express their feelings. Hats off to Amir for speaking his heart out!!! Let other actors and leading personalities likewise speak their heart out. <br/><br/>
It is true that minorities do have the sense of insecurity under BJP's rule. The BJP has cleverly recruited social media goons who come out in support of the BJP - RSS, no matter whatever the government does.<br/><br/>
You cannot force feed the BJP - RSS kind of patriotism into the hearts of people.

LOL aamir ji koi aur joke maar lette .... we on streets don't feel what hell u feel inside high security. Be a normal Indian than just show off

                            Like my brother left for US during congress rule: he d8d not see opportunities,  he felt insecure with the law and order situation.<br/><br/>
Wonder if he had made a hue and cry. The media would have killed him.<br/><br/>
Media is filled with biased individuals. <br/><br/>
Why no media raised hu ha at 1984, mass migration of hindus, no responsibility of governance  and law towards commoners  and many more.<br/><br/>
Is it because pseudo Gandhi family  practice Islam or were you paid bribe.

                            India is most tolerant country in world. As muslims grabbed this country for last 1000 years, England used this country for 200 years. and even muslims has devided indian into 3 parts. if india was not tolerant country these muslims and English men would not have ruled the country.<br/><br/>
even after all this we are working for muslims is this is not tolerance. Even muslims and so called secularists are abusing indians as intolerant. you can see around the world, most peaceful country is only india. Amir and Sahrukh are hardline muslims and internally they are always against hindu values.

                            Someone said yesterday aamir used glycerin to cry on tv, his children are strictly muslim. My child is strictly hindu coz he is born in hindu family. What is strictness in this.modi is a great leader maybe but all have flaws. Illiterate people are using bjp power to pressurize muslims and establish gundaraaj in the name of peaceful religion

                            Basically nobody is bothered whether he stays or leave the country. At this juncture where beef politics are settling down..  <br/>
what is the reason for him to reveal such sensitive irresponsible statement, don't he know how India would react?<br/>
in your own words "Aamir is bloody smart. He takes risks. He calls the shots. He changes the game. He raises the bar. His positioning in the CSR space has been consistently positive" <br/><br/>
did his calculations gone wrong?

                            I do not know why you have this special soft corner for Aamir Khan. Had it been SRK or Salman, I know what you'd've written. When SRK was hounded at Wankede stadium by a cheap guard for his 15 mins fame, you supported the guard &amp; not SRK. Was it the surname ? I do not think you were with Salman as well when the case came up ? You didn't remember the surname at that time ? Amazing. Don't force your own personal prejudices upon us &amp; judge us on that meter showing yourself as a very secular Indian than all other Indians. C'mon, you know as well as I do that that is first rate bunkum. This is a country where Hindus like me were persistently taunted &amp; abused for sympathising with Salman Khan. Excuse me. Singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya was torn to pieces by the hindu brigade at that time. We didn't think of surnames at that time !<br/>
Aamir deserves the flak that he is drawing today &amp; much more. Shame on this hero for not having the guts to own his statement on the tolerance of this country which gave him everything from fame, money, security etc. If we were 'intolerant' as he says we are he wouldn't have risen to this level. And that is a fact. We will not die without watching AK. There are others &amp; definitely better ones. Shame on this so called hero to use Kirron as a shield for this misadventure. Slip of the tongue ? C'mon, AK ? This was a calculated publicity stunt (who else would know that better than you ?) to attract attention of TV channels to air this story day &amp; night. Thanks to Burkha, you etc, he achieved what he wanted. Tomorrow all the Indians will rush to the theatre to watch his films like PK to earn him Rs 500 cr which he loves though he doesn't like this country. First class treacherer. You can pat your back for backing such a person &amp; for becoming suddenly "secular" unlike other hindus.

                            why were you shouting from the roof tops baying for the blood of certain remarks from your enemy camp - look anyone in a credible standing should be socially responsible in thoughts words and deeds. Where was this "hero" when 500K original Kashmiris were ethnically cleansed by his co-religionists - political and communal hypocrite, this "hero" and his supporters. Frankly he is a zero. This is my opinion and freedom of expression!

                            Is it okay to tell ordinary citizens who are critical of certain government policies to "Go to Pakistan" and leave the country... but not okay for a star to say his wife was deeply concerned about the future of their son... and therefore thought of leaving India?- This sums up the intolerance in the thought of some of us.

                            So Aamir goes to a high profile function and shares a candid bedroom talk that he had with his wife, for nothing? Is that what you want to say? Was it all to kill time? What was he implying?<br/><br/>
Aamir is the brand ambassador of Indian tourism and a beloved personality of millions across the world. His words can create friendship or create riots. Even the slightest suggestion that it is okay to run away when the country is in trouble, will send wrong message to the citizens. We need him and people like him to boost moral of public and encourage them to take the country's problems head on.

                            India will be the most beautiful country to live in.... Just Remember Mr. and Mrs. Khan - you are because we are.... <br/><br/>
had u not been in India .... u would never have been Mr. Perfect. I dont say you lost the right to speech but some speeches may hurt others.If you really hate this country because of the insecurity where exactly will you go and live - US,UK,France - all have their share of crimes in one or other way(I hope u even get foreign news on your TV). <br/><br/>
Rest if you want to go ..please go ..... dont make a drama of your departure...its not a movie in progress...people have looked towards you as role models - so at least don't break their hearts. They have devoted some part of their lives appreciating you,worshiping u-so its ok if one god goes.U will be replaced but trust me u will miss all this when u will be gone<br/><br/>
You and Kiran were brought up as kids in the very own country which u plan to leave. Leave but leave the dignity of people. It might be a bed time talk between you and your wife - that doesn't give you the liberty to speak anything in Public. You are the face of the Public - please don't embarrass us in front of the world where ur inconsiderate statement will bring the entire image of the nation down. We already have enough problems around - please dont increase them.
