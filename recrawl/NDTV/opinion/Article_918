Headline::::The Islamic State Wants You to Hate Muslims



DateTime::::2015-11-18T13:27:00+05:30




                                After the terror attacks Friday night in Paris, it did not take long for anti-Muslim forces to lash out around the world.
A mosque in Canada was deliberately set on fire Saturday, Ontario police say. In Oregon, anti-Muslim protesters held a rally outside the Portland Rizwan Mosque, one of them with a shirt that said "Proud to be an infidel. Islam is a LIE." In Florida, the Islamic Center of St. Petersburg received a bomb threat over voicemail: "We are tired of your [expletive] and I [expletive] personally have a militia that is going to come down to your Islamic Society of Pinellas County and firebomb you and shoot whoever is there in the head," the caller said, according to News 13.
And in France, while politicians stressed national unity, local news outlets reported several incidents of mosques, kebab restaurants and halal butcher shops being vandalized with hate messages. A tribute in Lille for the victims of the attacks was disrupted by demonstrators carrying a banner that read: "Expel the Islamists."
This is what ISIS, the Islamic State, wants.
"This is precisely what ISIS was aiming for -- to provoke communities to commit actions against Muslims," said Arie Kruglanski, a professor of psychology at the University of Maryland who studies how people become terrorists. "Then ISIS will be able to say, 'I told you so. These are your enemies, and the enemies of Islam.' "
The moments following a terrorist attack are often filled with acts of reprisal. In the six months following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January, anti-Muslim violence and mosque vandalism more than quadrupled compared to the same period in 2014, according to the Collective Against Islamophobia in France, a watchdog group.
Extremist groups feed off of alienation, some counterterrorism experts say, and Islamist militants deliberately aim to make Muslims in the West feel isolated and turn against their own communities.
According to this line of thinking, acts of terrorism widen the cultural divide by provoking hate crimes against Muslims in the West. This strategy gained traction in the early 2000s after al-Qaida was sent into hiding by Western military action. Abu Musab al-Suri, an influential jihadi thinker whom the Wall Street Journal called "the new mastermind of jihad," argued for a distributed network of terrorist cells recruited from the Islamic diaspora, carrying out terrorist strikes in their own communities. These attacks, and the backlash they generated, would inspire other to radicalize.
"What the Islamic State wants to do is to start a civil war," said political scientist Gilles Kepel Saturday in an interview with French newspaper Le Monde. Kepel, a professor at Sciences Po and an ISIS expert, has extensively studied the ideology and strategies of modern-day jihadis.
Al-Suri, Kepel said, had a vision: "a proliferation of blind attacks that will provoke lynchings of Muslims, attacks on mosques, harassment of women in veils, and create hotspots of war that will put fire and sword to Europe, seen as the soft underbelly of the West."
The attacks on Paris this weekend seemed to follow Al-Suri's script. Four of the terrorists have been identified as French or Belgian nationals who were recruited in the West. And if these early incidents are any indication, anti-Muslim sentiment will again surge in Europe, further distancing Muslim communities.
A study published last year in The Economic Journal found that the spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes after 9/11 led to a decline in assimilation rates in American Muslim communities. In places where hate crimes increased the most, Muslim immigrants in subsequent years spoke English less fluently, were less likely to marry non-Muslims, and women were less likely to be working.
These trends occurred independently of pre-existing patterns of immigration. As the authors write, the results "suggest that terror groups may try to provoke a backlash against their own ethnic or religious group in the targeted country, in order to halt the assimilation of Muslim adherents into Western society."
The problem of alienation is particularly acute in Europe, where there are large populations of Muslim immigrants concentrated in ethnic enclaves, who suffer discrimination and lack economic opportunity. "A territorial, social, ethnic apartheid has spread across our country," is how French Prime Minister Manuel Valls described the situation in January after the Charlie Hebdo attacks. For some youth living in France, the situation can quickly become a recipe for radicalization.
Kruglanski's research investigates why people join groups like ISIS. He argues that recruits are propelled by a need for respect and self-esteem. "It's the desire to matter, to be noticed, to become a historic figure," he says. "It's the most powerful motivation we have." Kruglanski calls it the "quest for personal significance."(Jeff Guo is a reporter covering economics, domestic policy, and everything empirical. He's from Maryland, but outside the Beltway.)

                            No hate. No flowers either. Just start buying electric cars. In 20 years Middle East will be as peaceful as South-East Asia.

                            Maybe yes. BUT WHAT ARE GOOD MUSLIMS DOING TO COUNTER THIS - TO TELL US THAT THEIR RELIGION DOES NOT PREACH JIHAD, FATWAS, VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM? WHAT ARE THEY DOING TO HELP US BELIEVE IN THEM AND IN ISLAM?

                            All good points. But Mr. Guo should also acknowledge that IS has heavily recruited European Muslim youth majority of them living peaceful and relatively wealthy suburban lives. So the disaffected and discriminated ghettoized Muslim youth theory has been squarely debunked. What's happening in western world right now (reprisal on mosques and muslims) is very natural human instinct when feeling vulnerable. Mosques in Europe and US still preach hate and are a breeding ground for terror requirements as per most intelligence agencies. The onus is on Muslims to get rid of the bad apples from among them as the rest of the world had been waiting patiently for a very very long time.

                            Enough of your pseudo intellectual analysis about everything regarding islam. Its islamophobhia when muslims fear backlash and its islamophobia if non muslims fear muslims as well? They are always the victims aren't they? Yes isis might want me to hate muslims but i am not here to do what isis wants i have something called common sense. Well isis also wants us to admit more syrians into the US and the Western world and thats being done without fail, why don't you write on that?

                            The problem with liberal writers is that they do not want to call out the real problem, in this case the radicals in Islam. Instead they indulge in niceties of how we need to tackle the aftermath of a ruthless terrorist incident. Of course every religion has its share of radicals. But here the issue is, going by author's line of thinking, radicals are doing things which are able to influence even the moderates in their faith. If that is the power of radicals in this faith then why not deal with it head on? Instead why advocate being nice fellas

                            The religion is the 'problem'. I am sick &amp; tired of listening to the lame excuse that - "oh no - my religion always teaches peace &amp; harmony ... this has nothing to do with my religion..." In that case, I would ask them to put themselves in front of the mirror and ask the question -- "if my religion is sooo0000 great, then why the children from my family or those from other families of 'believers' simply get intoxicated to kill the so-called 'non-believers' !!!!"<br/>
It is time to differentiate between the human being and the religious fundamentalists turned terrorists and their supporters / sympathizers. The human being must have the right to eliminate all of such elements, the way we have the right to kill bad bacteria / infections in our body by using medications.<br/>
If these feelings of mine make me an intolerant person, then I am happy to be that.

                            Jeff Guo, Arie Kruglanski, Gilles Kepel - this is exactly the problem with the WEST. All non-muslims being MIDDLE EAST, ISLAM and ISIS Experts. Defying basic logic. Just making a living in the talk and write circuit. What ISIS is saying or any of their other movements are saying is 'leave us alone' - they are convinced the world is out to get their regional oil using human rights, democracy and such as just a facade. They know for sure the west always props up a villain and then comes back another day to bomb him off. Is this installing democracy or just broad daylight theft gone wrong? Plus look at Iraq for instance. If only Saddam was the mad man and others were all peace loving democratic doves, why are they what they are today. Look at Libya - the same situation. So all over the region, the both sides deserve each other. Surprising the so called Middle East, Islam and ISIS experts do not even seem to have an inkling of this. Even if they have, they will not be open about it because it "may" lead to a permanent solution and their livelihood after that will be in doldrums.  In that sense, the rest of the world also deserves what is happening. West starts it, West ferments it and West needs to pay for it. No two ways.

                            How many of my countrymen irrespective of your religion is with me to support Indian Ground force to be stationed at Syria to fight ISIS along with France, Germany, Spain and Russia. <br/><br/>
If any one can, it's Indian ground force will silence all the terror outfits in the world, like they did in Afghanistan. It took decades for Russia and then USA to screw up Afghanistan situation. And it took only few months for India to bring back the peace to the country.<br/><br/>
But I have a condition, once Indian ground force will bring the silence in Syria, they will be given a chance to step on the Pakistan soil to take few days rest and breathe some kashmiri air.

                            What the world must realize is that 1.5 billion Muslims will simply not vanish some day! ISIL is fomenting trouble around the world because the more alienated Muslims become, the easier it is to recruit them to their evil cause.'We hate Muslims' is the battle cry in many countries in the west and therefore the largest recruits are from Europe. Is it strange that Asian Muslims from India, Bangladesh,Malaysia,Indonesia etc are less attracted to ISIL? The Arab Muslims have a legitimate grievance because of dumb things the SS/Britain did in Iraq,Libya etc. It is time to act in a manner that we don't play into ISIL's hands!
