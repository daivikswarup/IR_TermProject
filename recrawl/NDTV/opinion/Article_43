Headline::::Pak Media Virtually Blacks Out David Headley's Revelations



DateTime::::2016-02-10T14:02:00+05:30




                                David Coleman Headley, a Pakistan-born American national who helped plot the deadly Mumbai terror attack in 2008, has testified that that he visited India seven times before the attacks to scout potential targets for his handlers in Pakistan. During the deposition, Headley repeated the statements he had made earlier in 2011 while testifying in a US court - he said that Pakistan's main spy agency, the ISI, was involved in planning and executing the attacks which lasted for three days and left 166 people dead.
The news of David Headley's deposition met with a rather cold response in Pakistani newspapers and electronic media. While a couple of Urdu and English newspapers carried the news, almost all the leading television channels in Pakistan gave no or very little coverage to Headley's testimony in which he more or less repeated what he had already told a US court.
There could be a couple of reasons behind the snubbing of Headley's deposition by Pakistani media at large. One is that David Headley, formerly known as Syed Daood Gilani, was never given any significant coverage in Pakistani media even when he was being tried in a US court where he first stated that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Agency provided financial, military and moral support to terrorist organisations such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and Hizbul Mujahideen. Pakistan, remember, has always insisted that the ISI has no links toÂ Lashkar-e-Taiba and has categorically denied a connection of "state actors" to the Mumbai attacks.
The other reason which might have kept Headley's deposition out of the headlines in Pakistan is that it contained nothing new apart from the revelations made by Mr Headley during Monday's hearing that that two failed attempts to carry out terror attacks in Mumbai were made in September and October 2008. Last but not the least, any statement directly accusing Pakistan's powerful intelligence agency ISI of planning and executing a terror attack would be deemed as anti-Pakistan material among Pakistani media and ultimately won't see the light of day in Pakistan.
The only notable reaction came from the then interior minister of Pakistan, Rehman Malik. Talking to reporters in Islamabad, he claimed that David Headley was an agent hired by Indian intelligence agency RAW and that India itself was involved in the 26/11 attacks. While these claims would sound outrageously absurd to many readers on both sides of the border, Mr Malik could not care less about that.
While declaring David Headley a RAW agent, Rehman Malik, who now chairs a committee on interior and narcotics control in Pakistan's Senate (the upper house of parliament), also questioned India's intelligence failure, pointing out that the terrorist entered India repeatedly without any problems and spent two years photographing and filming potential targets.
India has long sought Mr Headley's deposition in a bid to establish a direct connection between the Pakistani authorities and the deadly attacks in Mumbai. It has alleged this clearly and submitted evidence, but the Headley statements will help generate pressure on the Pakistani government to take action against those who masterminded the Mumbai attacks. Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, one of the main accused in 26/11 and a commander with the outlawed militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, was freed from jail last year. Lashkar founder Hafiz Saeed, who moves freely throughout the country, recently praised the Pathankot air base attack and warned of others like it while addressing a public rally in Muzaffarabad.
David Headley's deposition has come at a time when Pakistan has just given a clean chit to Masood Azhar, chief of the outlawed militant group Jaish-e-Muhammad, in the Pathankot attack. According to media reports in Pakistan, the investigators termed evidence provided by India insufficient and claimed that some lower-rung members of the Jaish could be behind the terror attack on the Indian airbase last month. Earlier, Pakistan had told Delhi that cell phone numbers submitted as evidence by Indian
authorities had no record in the country.
What all this adds up to is the return of India-Pak relations to razor's edge.(Ali Salman Alvi is a freelance columnist and a political activist.

                            Ever since Pakistan become nuclear power, ally of America in war against terror and growing patronage of China, this nation has become excessively brazen in it's outrageous anti-India practices. Come what proof they deny it whemently and it has started blaming India for self destruction. Given the tendency of Pakistan chances are they will invent some fictitious charechtor as a approver for terror crimes  hinting a handler in India and RAW as a source  for violence to undermine their misdeed . At that occasion, Pakistani Medea will put their act together to highlight this news  manufactured artificially. America failed to reform Pakistan , how we can bring out something positive from them as they are devoid of any positivity  and they are worst for even their own citizens.

                            Look out at our media . Press or electronic are happy undermining our own system by publishing all sensitive details publicly which help terrorist activity. Even any positive steps by Govt is criticized by the media to scuttle growth.

                            Pakistan is a failed state. Its elected government does not run the country, its army does. It has been repeatedly named as a supporter of terrorism by every democratic country in the world. Its government, army and the judiciary are all complicit in supporting terrorist activities. Since it does not have a free press, now the media is also actively trying to hide the truth about its status as a pariah country which follows medieval islamic laws and has repeatedly been called one of the most dangerous countries. It has itself suffered more than 25 major terror attacks in the last 2 years alone, notably the killing of schoolchildren, but still sees nothing wrong in supporting islamic jehadists. So what is surprising about its cowardly media not acknowledging the truth about David Headley's revelations?

                            Thanks Mr. Ali Salman for keeping an eye on other side. I appreciate that you are very much objective in your write-up and stay clear of giving 'expert' comment. Most of the time, we see 95% opinion (weird that too) and 5% facts / news, in media. But your column till now remains exception. Pls. keep it up.

                            While I disagree with Rehman Malik's 26/11 being RAW or Indian sponsor. I do agree questioned India's intelligence failure, pointing out that the terrorist entered India repeatedly without any problems and spent two years photographing and filming potential targets.<br/>
I am afraid indian intelligence agencies operates like typical Indian offices with babu's work from 10-5, and spent 1 hour on lunch and break after every hour for tea/pan, and spit on office wall..

                            Kejriwal should see to other important issues and not on odd-even. He thinks this is the easy way to gain some coverage news as in all other issues he can do nothing.

                            Kejriwal claims 81% vote in favour of odd-even. This is utter rubbish. WHo are the voters? Bikers? Yes, because they get more space. The IIT gave reports that cars not the ones for pollution. He can spend the money he puts for odd-even to pay MCD workers. Why did he and his govt not continue the odd-even after Jan 15?
