Headline::::With 'Suit-Boot ki Sarkar', Rahul Gandhi Shows He's Back



DateTime::::2015-04-28T16:48:00+05:30




                                It's perhaps one of the greater ironies of Rahul Gandhi's spectacularly effective return from sabbatical that his almost casual aside during his Lok Sabha speech on the agrarian crisis, dismissing the Modi government as a "suit-boot ki Sarkar", has struck home - and stuck home as well. Ironical, because in the election campaign just a year ago, the BJP had managed to caricature the Congress Party as somehow out of touch with the needs and aspirations of a new India, while portraying itself as the truly authentic voice of a nation on the march. Eleven months is a long time in politics, and the boot, quite literally, is now on the other foot.
Of course, the Modi government invited this opprobrium upon itself through its conduct in office. From statements to photo-ops -- from the ubiquitous pictures of the Prime Minister accompanied by prosperous fat-cats on increasingly obscure junkets to the now notorious pin-striped suit with the PM's name embossed on every stripe - the Modi Sarkar advertised its distance from the people in whose name it claimed to rule.
The transformation of Mr Modi himself epitomized this change. To move from the assiduously-cultivated image of the chai-wallah with the ascetic lifestyle who had sacrificed the comforts of home and a doting wife to serve the RSS and the nation, to the omnipresent celebrity figure changing from one gaudily expensive outfit to another while hobnobbing with other celebrities, was a long way to travel in a very short while. The PM's evident relish at being on first-name terms with "Barack", having the Chinese President celebrating his birthday at his hometown and being one of four Twitterers followed by the Japanese PM may have been good diplomacy, but it was poor politics.
Indian voters had been sold a down-to-earth solver of their practical problems. They woke up and realized they had bought a fashionista with lavish tastes and a lifestyle far removed from their own concerns.
Disillusionment with the Modi Sarkar has been rampant. I cannot recount the number of Delhi voters, from all social classes and a variety of backgrounds, who told me their vote was to punish the PM's, and by extension the BJP's, "arrogance". The sweeping victory of the Aam Aadmi Party had less to do with great faith in their extravagant campaign promises than in the widely-professed desire to teach the Modi Sarkar a lesson.
That lesson has probably been learned, if the prompt auctioning of the offending suit (and the modesty, even drabness, of Mr Modi's subsequent attire since) was any indication. But it may have been too late: certainly what went before made the Government much more vulnerable to the suit-boot barb that Rahul Gandhi so casually, and so unerringly, skewered the Sarkar with.
The Indian voter does not like being taken granted. The Indian voter does not like being patronized. And the Indian voter does not like rulers flaunting their difference from the aam aadmi in the in-your-face manner of the pinstriped suit and all the trappings that preceded it.
What Rahul Gandhi has effectively done with one throwaway phrase is to construct a narrative of an elitist, overdressed regime ignoring rural realities, favouring foreign summits over domestic distress, and cozying up to capitalists instead of attending to the country's debt-ridden farmers. This may be a gross simplification, but as the BJP knows all too well, such simplifications are what political perceptions are made of. The Modi wave was built on caricaturing the Congress as a "scam Sarkar". It now has to live down its own image of a "suit-boot Sarkar".
But beyond the political phraseology and the sound-bite moment, the entire episode is reflective of one of the great strengths of Indian democracy - its capacity to bring its rulers down to earth with a bang. In the old days you had to wait till the next election to achieve that result. In the Information Era, the pendulum swings much faster.
I have not always been a fan of the 24/7 television era in our politics, which in many ways has been guilty of dumbing down the discourse and elevating TRPs above reasoned argument. But there's nothing like TV to convey the visual images that make political perceptions so potent - the pinstriped suit, the suicidal farmer, the arrogance of the well-heeled. "Suit-boot ki Sarkar" sticks because the truth it tells is reinforced by a hundred images from the last eleven months of all-Modi-all-the-time TV coverage.
When Rahul Gandhi embarks on his padayatra visiting suffering farmers in a lean monsoon, while the PM flaunts his designer suits in one exotic foreign locale after another, "suit-boot ki Sarkar" will not just haunt this government, it will oblige it to pay attention to the problems it had preferred to ignore, and the people it had taken for granted. If it doesn't do that, the perception battle will be irretrievably lost. And so will the next election.
One phrase can do that. And by using it to such telling effect, Rahul Gandhi has not just announced that he is back. He is making us all wonder if he had ever gone away.(Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Ah, this joker is back.  Someone like Shashi, who lived in the 5 Star luxury for the good period of his tenure as Minister and refused to vacate despite multiple reminders, and criticized his own Govt. for having to travel by "cattle class", he has no right to talk about Suit-boot ki sarkar. Has Rahul Gandhi done a huge favour to the nation by his presence in Parliament and made 2 speeches.  People of India are not going to be fooled by such cheap gimmicks, may be the die-hard sycophants of Nehru-Gandhis.

Even if RaGa is good at heart, it doesnt help the country. He isnt made for politics of the sort that happens in India. And atleast guys like Shashi shouldnt pretend by writing such opinions.

                            We have seen what good politics from congress over 60 years which took this country to bankruptcy. But for congress and myopic views of its PMs and high commands our kids at least would have led decent life if not prosperous. RG is a joke - only rhetoric and no substance. He has so far not offered single logical view on how he wants to develop this country, provide employment to youths and bring peace. What he is saying is if any middle class and rich left in this country, rob them and dole it out so that every one can become very poor in coming next 60 years.  Congress model of development is simple, loot and loot more. that is what congress is and it will remain same since leadership in this party is a privilege to few. I am shocked after 60 years it still don't have single other person who can take party to next level. Writers such as you are Nero's Guest singing always what king wants to listen. Keep on compromising on your 'intellectual integrity' keep on praising king since he will decide to distribute tickets. Sure you will be compensated well for this slavery

Point taken by you and your Rahul Baba.. The PM should probably be going in a Dhoti(a torn one probably?) next time he goes and presents 'Make in India' on international soil!!<br/>
You had 50+ years, Congress couldn't do anything worthwhile, atleast act as a  responsible opposition and raise topics which would make a difference to the country. Thank You!!

Nehru suit used to be sent to London for claening, but again he was a rich man and should not be questioned, but a poor man should always answer how he got his dress.

                            I thought that only Mani Shankar Aiyer could write rubbish like this. Welcome to the club dear Shashi Tharoor. You think that with one phrase Rahul Baba can reclaim lost ground? Or the Indian public will get fooled? Think again. The Congress got votes all these years because there was no viable alternative. Never again. Its fate will be the same as of the Left, the Janatha group or all the regional parties. Your time is up. In 60 years the Congress left India as poor as at Independence. Only there were more poor people than before. Even worse it left India without hope of a better future. If you think Indians will ever trust their fate to the Congress, and especially with the Gandhi family, think again. Rahul Baba is back - from where? Or from what? Or why? Answer those questions honestly, and you will know why the Congress has no hope. Ever.

                            Mr. Tharoor... sycophancy from others was okay. But you? Even you? Sad. Very sad. As much as you are not the 'grassroots' politician which the Indian public always support, you are an achiever at your own level. Why stoop down to appreciating someone who is nothing compared to you? And for one or two speeches? Not that I am a big fan of the ruling party - a party with which I am equally disillusioned, but then, RG has not done any great service to this country either. What farmers is he talking about? Congress have governed (RULED) this country for over 60 years. What did they do during those 60 years? Just screaming off a written speech is no big deal. My 17 year old son does it very well. Not to take away any credit from him, but don't be a "sycophant" like others. Please...

                            Rahul Gandhi if he had the chance to reflect during his absence would have understood that his growth or stature as a thinking leader has been stifled by the opposition but by sycophants in his own part.  Look at the way the Iyers and Tharoor's reaction. If uttering a punch line is any indication of maturity or blossoming of a leader then Rajnikanth should be the only leader in India.  Rahul Gandhi is trying to develop both as a person and as a leader.  So please let him evolve. Don't stop it with such utterances and make him feel good and lull him into believing what he is not.

                            Frankly, it is beyond my understanding that why few fools think that being "Pro-industrial" is being "Anti-poor". Only because of this poor appeasement politics, Congress has thrown India to a sink hole where it is very difficult for any government to get it back on track. Time has come for India to accelerate Industrial growth at the same time giving advance techniques to Framing industry. But poor appeasement parties such as congress will never understand this as they only know to do "Subsidy politics" rather than empowerment.<br/><br/>
Moreover, Mr. Rahul Gandhi has proved his credentials and political grasp many times infront of nation. We all know the stature of his understanding on current condition of country.  He not only lacks experience but also leadership skills which we need in a leader. <br/>
I believe rather than using unneccessary phrases, Congress should focus on some constructive debates on policies of government and give their contribution to nation building. (However, we know Rahul Gandhi and his capabilities!! )

Suit Boot ki Sarkar is better than the Loot Loot ki sarkar that you and your ilk have perpetrated on this country for the past 10 years.<br/><br/>
Secondly don't even think Rahul Gandhi is back and the Congress is back. As long as you continue to back this guy who took a sabbatical like Jonathan trott, we can be rest assured that the Congress will never come back to power

                            I pity Dr Tharoor's efforts to come to good terms with his bosses. Frankly, just because his master Rahul used the word suit-boot-ki-sarkar, does Dr Tharoor think that he could please his masters by such lavish praise of Rahul for the phrase?

                            Dear Me Tharoor, thee are many Indians who would like for the well educate and well spoken intellectual ministers of the congress to stand up and take this government on. Please show the country how much the GDP grew by. How we have 7 world class airports and a much better. Capital city and the many good things that happened. Stand up at international forums like Davos in large numbers and tell the world your story please. We are fed up with these lies and half truths.

                            Shashi thinks only Congress dynasty should wear Suit and Boot as they are the right inheritors of British Crown. What he doesn't comprehend is that hundreds of millions of neo-middle class who were previously in lower classes are now looking up to Suit and Boot as aspiration. When they see a former tea seller rubbing shoulders with the Western elite, their own self-confidence shoots up. Remember the message Ambedkar tried to convey to Dalits why he wore suit-boot. When Rahul derides this, only the already super-rich media moguls think he is connecting to common man. The actual neo-middle classes on the ground see it instead as povertarian and condescending to them and their hero, Modi. Remember, Modi wears suit-boot as a very good political statement, not easily understood by foolish Rahul and his 40 thieves!

It really does not stick as poor unemployed wear soot boot to get them job-that army of tied suited booted MBAs trying to get a clerical job in Banks.The rich like you and Rahul wear designer kurtas and cool casual wear.Your cattle class remark is still not forgotten<br/>
In fact you under estimate people's ability to see through you.No amount of your writing skills and facility with English will changes the perception of common people that you Rahul Scindia Digvijay singh are the super rich and congress as party of rich and neo rich<br/>
I feel sorry for you and rahul that both have to play act a part you heart or soul is not in it.By rationalizing Rahuls outburst and trying to give an intellectual fig leaf you are doing injustice to your own talented. I can imagine Rahul has compulsion to live down dynastic role but their is no reason for you to adopt Laloo like political role models

The congress party will talk to us about "lavish tastes" and "disconnect from people's concerns". All this apparent arrogance (or amnesia of their past), because Rahul Ghandhi their pampered and entitled prince/man-child found the gutts to squeak in Parliament after 10 long years of ineptitude?? Man!! If the congress thinks their past sins are going to be so easily forgotten, they are so wrong. If you want to get back your credibility, start ridding your party of the Gandhi coutourie and start apologizing for all the scams and failed economic policies.

                            When will Politicians tell the true story to the people they claim to represent. <br/>
Some actually considered themselves to be privileged  since they belonged to the jhoot aur rloot ki sarcar !!<br/>
Please move on from the angrez  concept or "politics" to the Indian concept of "Raj neeti"

                            The 3 famous Padayatras of independent India are:- The Young Turk Chandra Shekhar as president of Janata Dal undertook a marathon walk (known as Bharat Yatra) from Kanyakumari in South India to Raj Ghat in New Delhi covering a total distance of 4260 kilometers from January 6, 1983 to June 25, 1983. The main aim was to highlight the problems of the rural areas and eliminate the social inequalities and disparities prevalent. Dr. Y S Rajashekar Reddy walked under the blistering sun across the Andhra state and brought the Congress government back into power in 2004. He walked 1475 kilometers covering 640 villages for 68 days in the scorching hot sun and reached closer to the hearts of people and understanding the needs of the lesser privileged. But after getting power the biggest scams of independent India like Jalayagnam had its origin during his tenure. Treading the Gandhian Path, environmentalist Sunderlal Bahuguna marched from Kashmir to Kohima in 1982-83. The first to join the padayatra was 72 year old Gandhian activist, Sri Ratanchand Dehloo. The 4870 km trans Himalayan march was completed in 300 days. The Yatra carried the message of the vital importance of forests for our survival
