Headline::::Kejriwal's Ad is About the Cult of Personality. So What?



DateTime::::2015-06-23T15:49:00+05:30




                                I am really thankful to all who are spending their valuable time to criticise the AAP ad that's playing out on television. When the advertisement was designed, it was intended to target a particular audience;  we were not sure if it would reach them, but our friends in the opposition and others who used to work with us have made our task easier - they helped create a new curiosity around the advertisement with their vehement criticism. I am really thankful to Prashant Bhushan, the BJP and the Congress for making this a mega-hit.
I know they are all intelligent people and have been working in their fields  for a very long time but what I did not know is that they all have such a poor understanding of Indian culture and tradition. They say this advertisement is regressive in nature as it depicts women in a certain way;  they also criticise it because in their opinion this advertisement violates the Supreme Court order that bans politicians from being glorified in ads; they are also opposed to the advertisement because they say it promotes the personality cult of Kejriwal and not our party.
This ad does not violate the Supreme Court order because that verdict  clearly says that no picture of the LEADER can be used in any advertisement paid for by the government and the only exceptions are the PM, the President and the Chief Justice of India. No doubt this advertisement belongs to the Delhi Government, and talks about Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister,  but it uses no picture of Arvind. So where is the violation? If people are allergic to the name of Arvind Kejriwal, or they want to keep themselves relevant by criticising Arvind, then AAP can't help. If they want to feel haunted, then I can only extend my sympathies.
There are individuals who genuinely believe that the personality cult should not be promoted as it erodes the process of democracy . I don't want to quarrel with them but just gently want to make them realise that they are talking about largely a western concept which is quite alien to Indian thought. It's basically a borrowed idea which derives its sustenance majorly from  Left-oriented thinking. This idea is dead since the demise of the Berlin Wall, but a  few of us still want to live in that utopian world. Even the Left has not fully adhered to this concept of not individuals, but historical forces propelling the world.
In fact, pardon my saying so, but the worst kind of personality cult promotion was invented by Leftist societies with the design to establish that the leader can do no wrong. Marx was an idea and he was made God by turning it into an 'ism'. A rational theory was converted into a non-negotiable virtually religious belief and it was called as MARXISM. In the same way Lenin, Stalin and Mao became a cult and within the communist parties, nobody was allowed to criticise them. And it became so bad that anyone who differed with them was not allowed to live.
India as an idea itself is personality-driven. 'Avatar' is well ingrained in our culture and tradition. In fact, it is part of our great civilisation. If other religions have only  one God, Hindus have as many Gods as we can think. Every conceivable thing has been worshipped in Hindu tradition. 'Dashavatar', that is Lord Vishnu ,has descended on earth in ten incarnations to save the world.
Since the 12th century onwards, the Bhakti Marg is embedded in our larger collective conscience which is quite opposite to the Gyan Marg, and preaches that for the larger good, surrender yourself to God as only he knows what is good for the individual in particular and humanity in general.
So it's not surprising that after every brief interval, India witnesses few individuals who attain a superior status in society. M K Gandhi was a mere mortal like us but he was revered so much by other mere mortals that he became a Mahatma, who was called Bapu and also "Father of the Nation". He was so respected that though he was not a member of the Congress party,  no decision was possible without his permission. Now it's inconceivable to think if India could have attained  freedom without him ! I am afraid if he had been alive now, he would have been condemned by the above-mentioned individuals and parties. By their logic we should not have been using Gandhi's portraits in our government offices and in our homes.
Can we imagine modern India without larger-than-life size images of Jawahar Lal Nehru and Vallabh Bhai Patel? They were giants in their own right and there was a personality cult around them even in their life time. Nehru was the glue which kept India united and afloat in the most turbulent phase in our history. They are lucky that they don't have to live in our times, otherwise they would have been derided no end.
When students of Bihar went to request JP to assume the leadership of the anti- Indira Gandhi movement, he told them that he would be the dictator of the movement and his word would be final. In today's world, JP would have been cut into thousands of pieces for saying so.
Even the  RSS and BJP which promote collective leadership have  resorted to the Avatar of Ram, though erroneously, to gain political success in early and mid 90s. And the biggest example is the 2014 parliamentary elections which was portrayed and biled as the victory of one man named Narendra Modi. The  BJP could not have reached 282 seats  without Modi. And in 2015 Delhi elections, the same can be said of Arvind Kejriwal.
My only submission is that India is a spiritual civilisation. People love their  heroes when they see a moral force behind them. Avatar is not a material Idea but an ethical boundary. And as long as they are seen as treading the path of Truth, they are worshiped and the minute they digress from the moral high road, they are thrown into the dust bin of history. VP Singh is the greatest example of this.
So in the end may I request to all these ladies and gentlemen to read a bit of Indian history and culture and then react. And if the reaction is purely political, then I have nothing to offer.
PS - There is nothing wrong in the depiction of the woman in the advertisement. She is shown to be a politically-enlightened person who consciously chooses her leader ! What's wrong in that?

                            AAP is the only party in the world which comprises of all righteous, honest, educated ( not with fake degrees), and non corrupt people. Those who oppose AAP or its style of functioning are useless, corrupt, nonsensical people. Enough of this AAP and its daily soap opera. We are feeling sick about it now.

                            This article depicts clearly what has gone wrong with the AAP. A party found by intellectuals like Prasanth BhusHan has been taken over by morons like Ashutosh.<br/>
His regular appearance in TV channels has exposed his lack of an iota of intellectual thinking and to give more evidence of him being a retarded person, he comes up with these thrash blogs.<br/>
With people like Ashutosh around Kejriwal will not need any enemies !

In your add everywhere ARVIND &amp; no message or scheme? Which Supreme courts permits such public expenditure ? Until now high court slammed parties like congress &amp; Shivsena in the past for their expenditure on the birthday advertisement spending! They at least withdrawn &amp; were apologetic ! Arvinds party is hight of arrogance !

                            Ashutosh seems to be equating Arvind Kejriwal to be some kind of an Avatar. Very sorry to say, this kind of display of arrogance without any achievement just makes Arvind and esp AAP look very cheap. Saw an interview of Sadguru where he said anybody can become a national leader these by just blocking roads for 2-3 days. But to run a state let alone a nation is a huge task. Till now Aravind and AAP have just displayed their ability to stop and block things. Waiting to see them run the state for a change...

                            "So, what.."<br/><br/>
One can't expect other than this from typical AAPTard. But before saying this, have thought..<br/><br/>
1. AK and AAP were criticizing BJP specially Narendra Modi for government money spending on their brand image.Not once but more than 100 times, AAP used to criticize Modi for this when AAP was not in power. NOW AK IS DOING SAME....So tell us, how either you or your politics are different than other political parties..!<br/><br/>
2. Yes, when you explain SC order regarding state advertisement, THE CORE MESSAGE OF   THAT ORDER WAS THAT POLITICIAN SPECIALLY RULING PARTY SHOULD NOT MISUSE OF PUBLIC MONEY FOR INDIVIDUAL BRAND IMAGE CREATION.  So you are violating SC order ethically.<br/><br/>
3. Think if 29 chief ministers would ask their state to give such advertisement (which can market their name or create branding of their name) on national level channels? How much public money would wasted on this? Have you ever thought on this?<br/><br/>
If you want to branding yourself, do it by good public oriented work. Being at Delhi, AAP &amp; AK are getting much media attention (which hardly other state CM can get) . Even slightly good work would be highlighted by media and it would be better for you also instead of such adv which ultimately annoyed people.

APP thinks that election victory has given it licence to self glorification and propoganda. Arvind will go any length to achieve success. Truth is of least interest to him.

In the end all I understood was that he was defending the advertisement, but I couldn't understand how he could morally justify a sexist advertisement. AAP needs to fire their creative team, and most importantly - stop AK worship. With passing of time AAP will want to participate in elections from other states as well. But if no other leader is given space, how will people from any other state ever choose AAP. A political party is never just one man army. It may work once, but will definately collapse with time.

                            Kejriwal's only goal in life is to become PM.. He is viewing politics as a career option.. He is using his blind supporters (relatively much tiny support base than say AIADMK) - to enrich and establish himself..<br/><br/>
I don;t like to equate the head of this country with an empowered Mayor, But Kejriwal seems to have mastered the art of cheap and indecent publicity... I had to do this to clear certain clouds. Modi worked for India for 17 years. Then he became CM and was reelected 3 terms due to his proven track record of development. Gujarat today is a role model state.. And he went on to become the PM.. He has a cult-like following.. It is because of his efficiency and his sincerity and his firm adherence to Ideology...<br/><br/>
On the other hand, Kejriwal seems to have misread this. He is now trying to establish himself as a cult personality and the way he chose is to run TV ads and unleash his social media team (a small team with a 1000 fake IDs each) to do that job... Shame !

You are blaming always BJP and CCongress party, but in some sense you people have made the AAP worst ever party.<br/>
Now let me tell me how:<br/>
They did many wrongs, even u are in the governement from last 100 days, still u did a lots of wrong things, they tried to hide their wrong and even u did the same But they did not go to the level that they produce fake RTI.<br/>
What about u, do u have any shame MR. u, ur leader and all senior leaders were defending fake degree holder Mr. Tomar using fake RTI.<br/>
OMG what a shame!<br/>
Now I have a lots of doubt, all ur politics were dependent on RTI, u were producing all the documents in terms of RTI.<br/>
ALL ur RTIs are fake or some of them can be believed Mr. Liar?

                            The advertisment is a shocking attempt at self-aggrandisement and I am amazed that Kejriwal should have approved it. The focus should have been on Anti-corruption rather than one person. <br/>
This is a clear indication of how far AAP has strayed from the principles of the grass roots movement it started out from. It's true that Mahatma Gandhi, J Nehru, Vallabhai Patel and so many others were towering figures of their time, and we need more of them. But ask yourself, would any of these individuals ever approve such an advertisement to be made of themselves, and that to from Taxpayer money? <br/>
With the recent developments of hunting out key senior members, the childish feuds with the Centre, and now this Advertisement, I regret to say it appears that AAP is now moving on the wrong track. AAP - Get back to humility, Get back to principles!!

Despite several allegations he never initiated inquiry against tainted in AAP just like BJP &amp; Congis..Nowadays he is the biggest feku considering pre poll declarations &amp; post poll reality. I am from Varanasi &amp; he is such a bigot, lier as during LS elections on Varanasi he made several promises but after elections he never came back. Now he is also wasting hard earned money of tax payers like other parties, he can be compared to any other corrupt, selfish, dictator person... Not only Gandhi.

AAP thinks that their victory has given them licence for self glorification and propoganda( in the name of image building). Arvind and aushutosh have no interest in truth or public good. Only in one instance Arvind spoke the truth. His only goal is personal success at whatever cost. He can get many Ashutoshs to justify his whims.<br/>
Arvind and Ashutosh are no better than Mann in their understanding of Indian society. I am just curious, what prompted Ashutosh to attack communist movement and ideas?

If this is how Delhi gets ruled, Delhi ke "Bure Din" aa chuke hain :-)  The advertisement was really entertaining, I laughed openly after watching it, and I laugh everytime I see it. The "jokers" like Ashutosh who can cry on public TV after killing a peasant can do nothing but defend his boss.  AK has such a strong hold on party that everyone has to lick his ass to be there! If someone tries to go against the flow, they are shown the fate of YY and PB.  Good going Guys ... Dilli ki to lag gayi yaar !!

                            Dear Ashutosh,<br/><br/>
You are most welcome for our review of your advertisement. It's our job to keep an eye on politicians like you &amp; so we do.<br/><br/>
You call us intelligent but forgive us for not returning the compliment, since this your reply can be categorized as anything but intelligent. But no harm done! Anyone hardly expects such from you.<br/><br/>
Yes, the ad is regressive &amp; you may be walking on a fine line with "Jai Jai Arvind Kejriwal" minus his photo. But you know what I am not against the advertisement.<br/><br/>
What I am against are detailed in following points:<br/><br/>
1. This ad can be developed by AAP using its own money. Why are you using the public money from government for this purpose? The Delhi government hardly features in this ad (not surprising since well nothing to write home about so far).<br/><br/>
2. If you (AAP) also get into the mode of Person-worship (as us NAMO-bhakts do), then where is the new enlightened politics that you were screaming about? Were you not supposed to be different? Or was that only for your friends at TV studios?<br/><br/>
3. Please don't offer us sympathy for being haunted. That's like a poltergeist offering sympathy to a scared family!<br/><br/>
4. Your inclusion of Avatars, Lord Vishnu, MK Gandhi, Nehru &amp; Patel is mind blowing. But I do find it EXTREMELY communal. When you can invoke Lord Vishnu and Dashavatar for comparison to Lord Arvind, why not Prophet? Or Jesus? This blatant communal statement of yours, displays hatred for minorities. Why should minorities of this country cast their votes to someone who is an avatar of Lord Vishnu?<br/><br/>
5. This ad of your would have made perfect sense as a personality driven advertisement had you released such an ad for elections. That's the time to gloat about your achievements (if any). But even then with AAP money not Delhi Govt.<br/><br/>
P.S. - Whether there is something wrong with depiction of women or not, can better be answered by Women leaders in AAP Cabinet. Oh wait! <br/><br/>
We are sorry that you fooled us for so long by posing as an intellectual, secular, modern journalist who has just decided to venture in politics. But you have also been one of the people who have exposed how deeply the rot runs. <br/><br/>
Sorry Ashutosh. We are sorry that you are/ were part of our Media.

                            This is such weak defence of setting such a terrible precedent in Indian political culture. Selectively taking concepts from "Indian ideology and culture" and using those to justify an advertisement in bad taste makes you sound like one of the BJP spokespersons.<br/><br/>
But most importantly, only a short postscript about the depiction of a household slavery of a wife, well done!

                            Ashutosh is right. They are making issue of a small ad. while doing nothing about Sushma Swaraj, Vasundhara, Dushyant, Tawde, Irani, Ghadkari who are accused of wrong doings and PM is completely silent on that since a week now.

                            Swaraj = (at least one person's) own rule!<br/>
Arvind wanted Swaraj, he got it.

                            "it was intended to target a particular audience;  we were not sure if it would reach them, but our friends in the opposition and others who used to work with us have made our task easier", -- Ha ha ha ha , thats the approach of a govt., seriously you are pathetic.<br/><br/><br/>
 "I did not know is that they all have such a poor understanding of Indian culture and tradition." -- oh (poor) boy (in fact man, no more boy) - we have been born &amp; brought up in India, so please dont have wrong assumption that people dont have understanding of Indian culture.. if Raja Ram Mohan Roy had thought the way AAP is thinking now a days "understanding Indian culture" sati practice had continued for long time. We are blessed that Raja Ram Mohan Roy had understanding of Indian culture but was not regressive thinker.. so dont mix the two aspects of understanding Indian culture &amp;  regressive thinking.<br/><br/>
 "they are also opposed to the advertisement because they say it promotes the personality cult of Kejriwal and not our party." -- ha ha ha ha  good job to squeeze in this point in the end of other issue... I wonder why didnt you had detailed views on this.. well about your point, your title describe your thinking - "so what"; I think logical conversation on this would be like banging head with a wall because your thinking is "so what".<br/><br/>
and further you dont have logical argument so you spent your time to find loopholes in court verdicts and history... I clearly understand why hijackers of AAP party had allergy to YY &amp; BH ...

                            Yes Ashutosh, It all starts like we are different from everyone. Then tell everyone we are very honest. When the reality bites then shout everyone is targeting us. I have some hardcore AAP friends. Even they do not have a clue about the work done by Delhi government. There is no vision in changing the policy. They all tell me central government is not allowing Delhi government to function. It is very hard to swallow this statement. <br/>
Central government has lot more power over Delhi than other states. But state government has enough power to change policy to make life easier for the citizens. If the goal is to make drastic changes and chaos then AAP does not have the power for it. If you do not know then power of AAP government is in legislation. You can define the procedures and change policy to make it simple. Make it non ambiguous so there is no scope for misuse. Sisodia talked lot about education. He is only talking about making the life difficult for schools and in turn parents. He should start with government schools (under his department) and make them world class. How to measure he is succeeded? When the ministers of Delhi government send their kids to government schools.
