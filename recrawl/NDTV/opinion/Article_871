Headline::::400% Pay Hike For MLAs is Essential



DateTime::::2015-10-08T19:17:00+05:30




                                The salaries of MLAs and MPs have always been a contentious issue, seen by the public with a lot of cynicism. It has been seen as another proof for politicians' lust for money. If I say that politicians are the most hated characters in our society, I should not be blamed for hyperbole; with the exception of a few, they are a reviled lot. In the people's eye, they are synonymous with anything and everything which is wrong with our society. Before I jumped into politics, I used to not like politics and politicians, though I had and still have very good relations with some of them and I am proud of my association with them. And one of the basic reasons for the unprecedented support for AAP has been our un-politician-like image and persona. And that is why the BJP/Congress and other traditional political parties are trying to prove that AAP is like them. They know if they could do that, AAP will lose its USP and we will be seen like any other political party.
The debate about the proposal to hike the salaries of MLAs in Delhi has to be contextualised in this framework and we need to understand the nuance of new politics and the conspiracy of the old. Let's first ask the question "Do MLAs need a salary hike?" My answer is simple - they do but with a BUT!  The MLAs of old politics don't need any salary if I may put it simply. We are in an era when corruption is rampant and it is proved by the recent statement of ex-Home Secretary and BJP MP Mr R K Singh saying that assembly tickets in Bihar are sold to criminals by BJP leaders. MLA and MP tickets are auctioned and the highest bidder gets the reward in a particular constituency. The price tag is mind boggling. There is no limit. It can be Rs. 20 to 30 crores. After "buying tickets," these leaders spend another few crores to win elections either by hook or by crook. Every dirty trick in the book is used. Money is spent like water. When such candidates become MLAs, they would undoubtedly like to recover their investment and earn more for the next elections. Do you think such MLAs would be happy with the meager amount which they get as a salary? Not a chance; they are not there to do social service. Politics in India is the most lucrative business.
After winning the elections, many AAP MLAs told me that bureaucrats and officials had come to their homes soon after the elections results and asked "Sir, the previous MLA would ask us for this amount... what should we do for you?" According to them, Rs. 12 to 14 lakhs per month is the amount which an MLA used to get earlier from the local bureaucracy and contractors. They were told that the MLA received this money without asking. It is called Nazraana (a present given to a guest or stranger). And if an MLA is greedy or enterprising, then only the sky is the limit. There are many MLAs who rode a scooter before getting elected, and now they have a BMW or Mercedes and live in palatial bungalows. Do you think they could buy these luxuries from their salaries?
AAP MLAs have been warned that if they are found indulging in any such corrupt practice, the party itself will take them to Tihar Jail. More than half of AAP's MLAs belong to the lower middle class. Many of them had good businesses or jobs before jumping into the India Against Corruption movement but over a period of time, their businesses collapsed and jobs were lost. Now they are dependent on the salary they get as lawmakers or financial support from their friends and well wishers. It is impossible to sustain families with a salary of Rs. 12,000. It is true that they get other allowances to run their offices which are around Rs. 70,000 net but that amount does not go to the MLA, it is real-time expenditure.
Delhi is one of the costliest cities in India. Even a normal office on rent that an MLA needs costs Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 40,000 a month. If one adds other expenses like office boys, computer operator, clerk, driver and petrol to move around a constituency, this goes beyond Rs. 1,50,000. Then there are the innumerable constituents who visit the MLA every day and they all expect to be served a cup of tea or a glass of water and sometimes meals as well. An MLA is also expected to visit every marriage or birthday party held in the constituency and there also he/she is expected to bring some gift or pay some token money - the smallest of which is an envelope with Rs. 1,001. If he/she is not doing that as has been practiced by BJP/Congress MLAs, then it does not auger well in the constituency. Many of AAP's MLAs are already bankrupt or on the verge of being so.
I can understand that this is not an issue for those MLAs who have millions of rupees stashed away. There are many in our party too. It is also not an issue for those MLAs who are getting a cut in every financial deal happening in their constituency. It is important for those who are honest, and AAP MLAs are honest. Though I am also not denying that there are honest MLAs in other parties, their number is miniscule.
A salary hike is important for honest politics and clean politics. A salary hike is important for an honest MLA if we want him to live with dignity and self-respect. A salary hike is important if we don't want an honest MLA from any party to have to make compromises due to financial constraints. So it's my humble request that this salary hike recommendation should not be seen from the old prism where it was linked with greed. This should be seen as part of the revolution. It's for clean politics. It's part of the new beginning. Debate is good, but belittling the move will support those whom all of us want to uproot.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

Besides 27 members from 67 of your MLAs are crorepathis. In that case how is this justified. AAP is indulging in utterly shameful acts even parties like SP and RJD wouldn't do.

                            For MLA's 400% pay hike is essential. What about normal people of Delhi are they not suffering. If pay is to be increased it should be increased for everyone in state. How you justify MLA's need pay hike but other state services employee don't need pay hike.

                            First AAP said "Sab neta Chor hain", then said "Sab Corporates <br/>
Chor hain, followed by "Sab Media Chor hain". Now if you don't vote for them "Sab Janta Chor hain". Now they are justifying the 400% Pay Hike For AAP's MLAs (as their are only 2 BJP MLA other than them) of their own Party. <br/><br/>
It's height of justification on anything done by AAP is only correct by justifying a hike of 400% percentage that too by public money. Never heard of such increment anywhere in the world specially by a public service organisation or government.

                            The salary of lawmakers in developed countries is 2-4 time of their GDP/capita income. They do not get all the allowances as our lawmakers get. Delhi GDP/capita is INR 220000 and current salary of a lawmaker in delhi is roughly 900000 (including allowances) which 4-5 times of GDP per capita. Now they want to make it 400% hike which will make their income 20-25 times of GDP per capita and this moron is still justifying it. Shameless AAP, why they call themselves aam aadmi?

                            So, his basic point is that all politicians are corrupt and hence don't need salaries, but AAP MLAs are honest and so need a hefty pay check. According to this logic, they will protest to decrease pay scales when in opposition, but will hike salaries when in power. Wah! What a logic! Spellbound

                            Two of the honest MLA already in Jail for previous crimes - rest need 4000 % increase to keep them honest I guess. Kejariwal should get an extra allowance for allowing Dengue team into his house. He should also get an increment for successfully stopping Farmers suicide in Delhi after just one death in Rally. I think first increasing publicity budget 500% and then doing all the wrong things they always wanted to do is a pretty good strategy - Bravo !!

MCD low level workers not getting their meager salaries of 15-20 thousand ruppes a month coz ur fraudster master wont release funds he got from center for MCD...<br/>
this is not shameless but way beyond being shameless...

                            You start a movement you do sacrifices. If you find it hard to run your house with the pay and the perks you are receiving as an MLA, please quit politics. You make me wonder, had Bhagat Singh and other freedom fighters put conditions like economic welfare of their families, would we be independent today? If you can't sustain simply get yourself out of the movement

Then why don't you stop it. Isnt this similar to distributing money and liquor before elections. Makes no sense. And rest of reasons are same you couned 12000 but i am pretty sure all other expenses are already paid and i am pretty sure that includes petrol as well. Atleast you admit that while working for India against corruption lots of people used their own money and have nothing left, but that makes you like everyone you are trying to reap benefits of your investment.

Why blame him? Question instead why the Indian electorate hasn't matured and wisened up a little after almost seven long decades. Why are we blaming men like Ashutosh? We created him and his ilk....

Your all articles are so phrased that I can tell without knowing the name of author that it is written by Ashutosh.  Aur haan meri salary 6th Pay Commission mein badhi thi agar ab nahi badi to corruption will spread.  Aam Aadmi Party - 400% salary hike - Honest MLA - financial constraints - Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaha.  Ashutosh ji you know any person who don't have financial constraints, ab kitne bahane banaoge yaar, common on, you idiots are missing a golden opportunity.  Don't do this, do some favour to people of Delhi and not to yourselves.  Sharm to nahi aa rahi hogi itni dengue deaths ke baad bhi salary badhane ki baat kar rahe ho.

                            True to type, Ashutosh talks of MLAs as though they were businessmen running an enterprise. There is no justification for this type of hike. Especially from a party like the AAP with its holy image of practicing a new type of corruption free politics. Either practice what you preach or admit that you are no better than all the other money grubbing politicians whom you love to sneer at. Your salaries and allowances are more than sufficient for you to discharge your functions as MLAs. To paraphrase Gandhiji, there is more than enough to satisfy every man's need, but not enough to satisfy even one man's greed. The AAP MLAs have become one greedy bunch hankering after the loaves of office. The AAP will never get voted to power again either in Delhi or elsewhere. They are hypocrites and no different from other corrupt politicians with morons like Ashutosh to justify their greed. And one more thing, what will the public get in return after this enormous hike? Please elaborate.

                            Projecting an image of 'so called honest' politicians can never be a logic or justification for any salary rise.<br/><br/>
There are many in Delhi and in the country who have to take care of family and other responsibilities for which they require money.<br/><br/>
By he way, if someone can work on below details:<br/><br/>
1) Average income of people in Delhi<br/>
2) Minimum Wages prescribed by Delhi Govt. (Labour Department)<br/><br/>
These details will make it clear whether they mean a party of Aam Aadmi or it is adopted to catch sympathy of people.<br/><br/>
Lasty, any attempt to justify the proposed rise is just going to fall flat on face.

                            Why 400% increase only for MLA's ? If Asutosh's (il)logic is considered then who else in India does not require 400% increase ? All Govt staff, Public and Private sector staff also need 400% increase. IN fact the politicians are among the richest in India, having slashed black money in benami names in India and abroad, which is an open secret. Why BJP even after toll poll promises failed to bring in the so-called 4lakk crores (as per BJP's and their Ramdev's claims) not being brought back. And these (Poor ?) politicians want 400% increase. AAP is not going to be any exception. If they are given increase as per Asutosh's arguments, then why not BJP and other parties' ruled states also ? Just because they have the brute majoriuty to pass any bill approving huge increases in their salary, the public who voted for AAP will have to rise and fight against this daylight robbery of public money.

                            Mere salary hike will not catch hold of the corruption, other than politics there are other functions like police and judiciary which are corrupt and have expenses like such, and opportunity for easy money too. So according to your logic, their salary should also be increased by the same rate…..… what a common man will do?, how he will be non-corrupt?, from where he should increase his salary?……… It is also to be noted that salary hike can easily be done like you people are doing, but it cannot be cut / decreased, It should also be kept in mind.<br/>
I think you people should ponder more for the same.

What this shows: many of the criticisms or opinions made by this party and their leaders, in previous years, were without any research on facts and at times were not even based on truth. One such example-- what came as a twitter from its leader in the past about the same subject.<br/><br/>
I think this party and leaders need to grow-up and try re-building trust of nation.
