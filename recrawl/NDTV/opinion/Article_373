Headline::::Congress, Please Accept POTUS Visit Is a Success



DateTime::::2015-01-26T23:08:00+05:30




                                (Nalin S Kohli is spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Director of the party's Public Policy Research Centre. He is also a lawyer and has extensive experience in media and education.)First impressions are said to be lasting impressions. If the warmth of the bear hug between President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Modi on arrival in Delhi was indicative of a promising visit ahead, expectations are being met. The visit was considered historic even before it had begun. The President of the United States had, after all, accepted an invitation to be chief guest at India's Republic Day Parade, going where no serving President had gone before. Even the rain during the parade was not a dampener on the enthusiasm of all those who braved the weather to be a part of this historic occasion. A day earlier, both leaders had a one-on-one discussion during a walk followed by 'Chai Pe Charcha' in the gardens of the resplendent Hyderabad House. Not only was the ice broken, but there was also ample evidence of a warming personal relationship between the two leaders. Beyond formal engagements, both appeared relaxed and engaged in friendly conversation. This bodes well for the strengthening of the Indo-US relationship. However, beyond atmospherics, the sum and substance of the visit would expectedly be judged on specifics achieved, as well as on the roadmap ahead. From every perspective, the visit is substantive and successful. The setting aside of seemingly irreconcilable differences on the Civil Nuclear deal, beyond doubt is a significant breakthrough in Indo-US ties. The fact that even six years after the deal was signed, no actual progress had been achieved, was an indication about the existence of deep differences. Those have been overcome. It is believed that both leaders personally enabled the breakthrough during their interaction at Hyderabad House. President Obama waived intrusive checks  above and beyond those  exercised by the International Atomic Energy Agency, something India considered sensitive in terms of sovereignty. Prime Minister Modi ensured that India's liability law was not compromised. With this, the field is now set for operationalising the civil nuclear agreement. The establishing of a direct hotline between President Obama and Prime Minister Modi is another major development. It is testimony to the transformation of the relationship and also confirms the import each attaches towards enhancing this relationship further. The business community, also expecting greater economic engagement between India and US, is experiencing a major impetus. Both leaders have set aside time and opportunity for interacting with business leaders from both countries. The platform is set. It is now up to individual organizations on either side to make use of mutually beneficial opportunities that exist. The indications are certainly favourable and hold promise for stupendous growth. Some experts estimate that bilateral trade between India and the United States could grow manifold and touch as much as US $ 500 billion by 2020. Despite all this and the thumbs up by experts and analysts alike, a few perpetual naysayers insist on claiming how little has been achieved! Not surprisingly, this includes Congress party spokespersons or sympathizers. They rightfully claim credit for the signing of the civil nuclear agreement by Dr Manmohan Singh. However, the fact that nothing moved on the ground for six years thereafter cannot be obliterated. In raising the pitch on who signed the agreement, they inadvertently point to and only accentuate the fact that it took different administrations in both countries to bridge the gaps that would ensure its actual implementation. Some in the opposition have also gone out of their way in deprecating the Obama administration as a "lame-duck" presidency. The President of the United States is hardly "lame-duck". In fact, this powerful institution is anything but that. Perhaps the only "lame-duck" stance seen in recent times was under the erstwhile Congress UPA dispensation, in their inability to implement and actualize several initiatives. Through this visit, both President Obama and Prime Minister Modi have eliminated inertia that had crept into the relationship between the US and India. Both have committed themselves towards a path of structured and strengthened engagement. The refreshing informality and personal chemistry between the two leaders has set the stage, graciously, for a more synchronized strategy.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal

                            First, explain why you opposed the nuclear deal six years back? Because you were in opposition and your only job was to oppose? And the drama of trust vote after that? Mr. Nalin, all your economic decision for last eight months(GST, insurance bill etc etc) were the one you opposed while in opposition. So, right now you are only undoing what you did not allow previous govt to do. You have equal share in the condition of the country today, so do not blame only he previous govt.

                            What has happened today is not BJP Vs Obama but India Vs Obama. What is the honour or glory to be taken for Modi or BJP. It is nonsense. Several US presidents and others  have visited India in the past. It is too bad to politicise everything. For me what has been done is as a PM and for India. Let BJP not take any glory. The wages for Pride is Fall. Remember Snake and Ladder. 1999 may be repeated also. I believe in History.

Is that not an insult to the common citizens of India? BJP is the biggest hypocrite political party India has ever seen. BJP is implementing all the policies and initiatives of UPA government which they criticized not long ago and now claiming credit for it.

                            Why is BJP so insure and have such inferiority complex trying get validation from Congress regarding R-Day celebrations. Probably because they can't compete intellectually before the camera during TV debates. Both Obama here in US is a lame duck president and FEKU in India good for nothing PM his speicality grand promise&amp; speeches. Your article epitomizes insecurity within.

                            Have some confidence man. Why do you need validation and approval from Congress for everything. They are doing their job (just as you did it for the last 10 years stalling everything that you are rushing to take credit for now). You do yours. If you think just because some announcements were made regarding the civil nuclear liability the nuclear power age has begun in India then that's ok. You and your friend Jaitley seem like bad case of Congress obsession now. Get over it.

                            Your Gov made the Republic Day about Obama and Modi, while all other Republic days were about our country India. Also other than agreeing to remove the liability clause from our law, which you were involved in adding while in opposition, nothing tangible has been gained by India. Yes it was a success personally for Mr.Modi, as it contributed to his never ending PR campaign, but the visit hasn't produced anything beneficial for our country.

The time to celebrate and accept the success of the deals will be when there are nuclear reactors from US companies in India in the next 5 years..or atleast if some have started, else this will be just another signing which means nothing.

                            Modi has definately thrown dynamism into whole thing, no doubt. Couple of things, he still behaves like a Gujarati PM at every opportunity he gets, too much into lecturing and extravaganza at Indian taxpayers, poors money. Under him I believe Ambanis and Adanis are growing to grow exponentially and they in turn will fuel his PR and help him get reelected. I'm happy about sikular/communal BS has vanished after Modi. I would be happy with some other person from BJP like shivrag chovan etc who will do the hardwork behind the scene and not too much dancing with the stars.

                            How can you say that the Civil Nuclear Deal with the USA (called the 123 agreement) done by Dr. Manmohan Singh govt did not make any progress? The deal ensured IAEA approval and NSG waiver. We were able to complete kudankulam project and sign for additional reactors. We were able to secure uranium supply from a list of countries from Australia (one of the biggest opposer to India's nuclear test) to Kazakhstan( one of the top exporter of uranium). The push from USA because of the 123 deal ensured we got the IAEA approval and NSG waiver. The so called friend of USA ( of course pakistan) asked for similar agreement, which the USA did not even listen to seriously.

                            "The visit was considered historic even before it had begun". It was made historic my dear bhakt. So many presidents visted India before and since he visited on Republic Day it was made historic. Looks like tomorrow if some other country president visits India on Modi's birthday you will make that historic telling that "No other leader visited India on a PM's birthday". And what can we expect more from a paid BJP writere, show the flaws and mistakes of BJP till date.

                            Why is Nalin Kohl asking congress to accept the success of the visit? Let them not believe in this visit, nobody cares. People have voted them out and reduced them to 44 seats. That should tell the BJP that the country doesn't care for the Congress. Like a spoilt child, congress will throw their feet in the air crying over anything and everything and insisting the new govt has done nothing. <br/><br/>
As for lame duck President of the US. Only idiots like Mani Shankar Aiyar can think like that. US is not India where if a new government comes to power they undo everything done by the earlier government simply because they think they were voted into power to undo things of the past government. US policy whether its economic or foreign is rarely radically changed by change in government and thats how it should be. A country is run on policies not on whims &amp; fancies of politicians like it happens in India.

                            I would not call Obama a lame duck president. However he does have two Houses controlled by the GOP and less than 2 years of presidency left. The beginning has been made, but it remains to be seen how this bilateral relationship will progress beyond 2016. The new US president may not share the same views or have the same agenda as this one. I would prefer to keep the current euphoria at bay and watch for real change that benefits the public of both countries.

                            The bar can not be so low. A bilateral visit must yield constructive results that are transparently announced. Where is the transparency. Will it be like the swachh Bharat campaign. The Yamuna will die but modiji will play tag. When will anything happen

                            India has been accepted to be member of UNSC by most of the nations. However it is not materializing. This is not the first time that US president has given his consent.

                            Why u r so obsessed about America. <br/>
Question is What u have done in your home in last few months..<br/>
If your govt has done really better than why there are so many questions about performance of your govt...<br/>
Now in India nobody cares what Congress is doing but ya we do care what govt is doing ..so get back to work .. enough party already

                            Let me sum up my understanding and 2 cents on the progress that has been made so far - Namo and Obama have gone 1 step ahead and have signed the nuclear deal which was on hold for 6 long years most of which was during the earlier UPA regime and there has not been MUCH change in the agreement since 2008...so the govt of the day has accepted the bill almost As-Is due to their standing majority in the lower house of the Parliament they may not face stiff opposition for this decision of theirs. They may have gone 1 step ahead in prevailing over the US govt to soften their stand but have they gone 2 steps ahead in not being able to force the liability in case of hazard on the supplier - simply because crude prices have plunged in the past 1 year making nuclear energy expensive and avoidable hence the impact, criticality and priority of the success has been diminished in magnitude. One needs to congratulate both the UPA and the NDA for devising, drafting and now getting this deal signed as both made significant contributions which is indispensable - hence barring ground realities whether the increased nuclear energy going to actually benefit the country or not the success trumpet for the symbolism of the agreement should not be pointed towards only the ruling party !!

                            Sir,Can you hope to see congress accepting BJP's success? They will either play blind or try to find some (though very minute one) mistakes and bring it to a national level- Congress is known for that!

                            Haha…Nalin …sure it was a great success….with Modi calling him Barrack and they talking about who slept less. And for your information it was a Nucleat Deal…it was making way for a Nuclear Deal by reducing one hurdle of saying no checks needed which they agreed to. Of course, that is only the official line…they are not so stupid to let it pass…they'll check anyway (remember the bugging they did 'nunofficially'?).<br/>
Next, you seem to speak too fast desparate to claim credit…when Obama in the last two statements clearly said…business environment is not friendly enough and keep your religious rats at bay if you want something to happen. Quite a success in exposing your government's shortcomings, isn't it?? All that song and dance by Modi and your band of jokers stood exposed as just hot air and no substance yet and in less than 3 days whereas you couldn't wait to write your 'success story' for even 24 hours.

                            Mr. Nalin, visit of POTUS will be a success when we Indians also get American visa on arrival like your boss is giving everybody.  You say as such no US president visited India before.

                            the fanfare and the coverage given by our media on obama visit is nowhere seen in the US media.modi has bowed in front of obama and his body language was not coming off like a PM let alone a leader. his subservience is unbecoming of a PM, espesially when he said that there is a chemistry between him and Obama. Obama retorted though diplomatically that it is bcoz of the values reflected by the people of both countries. only bhakhts as usual can rejoice.

                            POTUS visit is a success .... but for who? ... They literally took the nation by the neck with having us spend so much money on the security, took control of the ATC towers, got the deal done " who knows what all disastrous conditions the Govt has agreed to" ...... the one hour eloquence by Sushma swaraj opposing FDI is still fresh in people's minds and completely contradicts what BJP is now doing ...... God Save this country .... it has been just handed over to a bunch of non trust worthy elements .........

                            Glad Obama is a Muslim from America... else he would have been forced to conversion.... Congress should agree that POTUS visit was a success since he has expressed clearly what Congress had in mind on religious tolerance...
