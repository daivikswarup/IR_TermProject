Headline::::Rajnath Singh Stopped a Documentary. But Not This Heinous Act



DateTime::::2015-03-09T13:02:00+05:30



(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer. She is working on a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi which will be published later this year.)
	In the last one week, India has seen a ban on a documentary called 'India's Daughter'. The government says this is needed to project an appropriately evolving image of India.
	At a time when a maze of social and political issues combined with an atmosphere of cynicism surround a government that seems to have done little to distance itself from the lunacy of fringe elements, comes an evil that seeks the immediate attention of the Home Minister and the government of the day - a film that has apparently shown Indian attitudes that must not be exposed.
	Prime Minister Modi during his tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat  had highlighted his work for the girl child as one of its major achievements. Ironically, according to a newspaper report today, there has been a 500 per cent increase in rapes of Dalit women in Gujarat.
	Similarly, the Madhya Pradesh government led by Shivraj Singh Chouhan has projects lined up for the girl child which are made public in every interview and played up before elections. In its manifesto for the 2014 general elections and in television ad campaigns, the BJP had expressed its disgust over the fact that every parent in India with a working girl or a school-going girl shares the concern over whether she will return safely home each day.
	The advert was pegged around one of the most highlighted and brutal rape cases in India, that of Nirbhaya, who was raped and murdered by a bunch of men in a Delhi bus while she was returning home with a friend in December 2012. The case shook the conscience of a nation with the grotesque act and the rapists' hatred for a resilient woman (expressed in the documentary we cannot be allowed to watch).
	For Nirbhaya's family, subjected to constant media glare and amid their own grief and pain for the daughter killed in such an inhuman manner, the approval for the film to be telecast speaks volumes of their progressive mindset.
	Many like me may have issues with what we see as a shoddy attempt by the documentarian in putting together incoherent pieces which do not seem to do much justice to the plight of Nirbhaya or many other women like her in India or across the globe. But for the central government to call it an attack on India's international image and a political conspiracy smells of a hypocrisy which the government might not wish to concede.
	Within days of ordering an absolute ban on the telecast of the film and asking for it to be removed online, the Home Minister of India, Rajnath Singh, remained a mute spectator when a mob of armed civilians attacked a man accused of rape in a jail in Dimapur, Nagaland. The victim, Syed Sarif Uddin Khan, a small-time used car dealer, was lynched by a mob, his blood-ridden body was put on display as crowds took selfies and pictures.
	It was alleged that Khan had raped a tribal girl from a nearby village and that he was a Bangladeshi immigrant (an accusation faced by most of the Muslim population residing in the North East). According to a newspaper report, jail authorities let the protesters inspect the crowded cells so that they could identify the accused and unleash their savagery.
	While Rajnath Singh sought an explanation from British filmmaker Leslee Udwin about her access to the accused in Tihar Jail, his officials shocked democracy by allowing mob mis-justice towards a man in Dimapur, charges against whom are proving to be flimsy.
	Not just has the Chief Minister of Assam Tarun Gogoi stated that there seems to have been no rape, it is now established that Khan was an Indian national. Not just an Indian national, the Home Minister would want to know that his family served the Indian Army in various capacities.
	His eldest brother died while fighting the Kargil war, whereas his two brothers Syed Jamal Uddin Khan, and Syed Kamal Khan are now with the Assam regiment. Their father, Syed Hussain Khan, served and retired from the Military Engineering Service (MES).
	The Superintendent of Police of the area, Bibekananda Das, has stated that he would not rule out the involvement of Naga militant outfits as the cops have recovered an AK-47 rifle magazine, 30 rounds of live ammunition and empty cartridges from the spot. Some allege that the attack was a premeditated and planned affair to stoke ethnic tension in the state. While speaking to NDTV, the victim's brother Jamal Khan said, "Is the Nagaland government running a jungle raj? The girl who filed the rape complaint was my brother's wife's cousin. Nagaland police have said that medical reports say she was not raped."
	So while a BBC documentary allegedly put India at risk, the brazen killing of the member of a family of armymen who protect the country day and night adorned India's hall of fame. While the government was quick to ban and remove every trace of the film, photographs of the naked corpse of Syed Sarif Uddin Khan with the crowd is still doing the rounds. While a curfew was put in place much later, Nagaland state police officials issued no statement stating that the accused was not a Bangladeshi national, a rumour that surged across the country.
	The alacrity with which the Information and Broadcasting ministry issued a statement on Indian culture while asking for a ban on the film was nowhere on display in Dimapur. It took a day for the information to go down in the public domain that an Indian civilian, not a Bangladeshi, was subjected to savagery rarely seen before.
	It took two days for the state Home Department to cast doubts on the allegations of rape and it is yet to be ascertained how  a mob of hundreds came together to plan and execute a murder with such precision.
	Whether the victim was rightly accused or not, will the government not want to tell its people if he deserved to die in this manner? And if he was innocent, as is now being disclosed, why were his family and he subjected to slander and a fatal assault?
	Yes, the Indian Parliament last week was shocked and hurt with the film as suggested by the Home Minister on the floor of the House. But Mr Minister, where is the hurt and shock at Dimapur? Is there pride in the public lynching of a man who could well be an innocent son of India?Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Worrying about one could be possible innocent son of India, Madam. Thousands of innocent Kashimiri Pandits were thrown out of their home land by fanatics goons some 25 years back in Kashimir Valley. Have you taken pains to feel their agony ! Pains and sufferings should not be on selective basis and people like you, who have been indulging in it is called shallow and bias journalism.

                            Do not make promises! A big take away for political parties based on result of 2014. Do not make promises but manage to sit in power, no one, especially no journalist will question you. Whether it is rape, killing of jawans, corruption, price rise, terror attacks and so on. Even after decades of such rule you will be awarded "cleanest" man by everyone including Media. But beware! you promise and you are accountable just everything that happens under the skies!

                            Irrespective of whether he was accused or not, a man getting killed by a mob, is highly deplorable, to say the least. But why even that is blamed on a Central Home Minister? No questions to the state government? And why is Tarun Gogoi's statement so important when he is CM of Aasam &amp; not of Nagaland ?

                            how did you reach to a conclusion that man did not rape the girl in the case of Dimapur ?? Agreed that the mob was wrong, but that is mob metality, when it picks up nothing can be done....if the polic had taken action on the mob, then also media would have reported that police is protecting the rapist !! At the same time, how are you finding the realse of movie on nirbaya right ? when they have not even taken permission from her parents..... decide either you are with the victim or with the rappist..<br/>
Surly you seem to be against the BJP govt.....reasons are known....you are not concerned about the victim or the care of that man who was killed by the mob

                            Any which way to bad mouth the BJP. Law and order is a state subject and the Nagaland govt is responsible for the lynching. Besides a detailed statement can only be issued after the facts of the incident had emerged. That Bangladeshis are not liked in the North East (remember Nagaland is a Christian majority state) speaks of the level of infiltration that has taken place in that region in the process altering the demographics. However, whatever the citizenship or the religion of the individual the lynching is abhorrent. As far as the documentary is concerned it should not be banned but the maker of the documentary has not covered herself with glory - what was supposed to a docu on rapists turned out to be one on Nirbhaya only - DOUBLE STANDARDS.

                            Big joke party is already shaming our country. Modi guy speaks about shaheed jawaans during election campaign but since he has become PM he reduced subsidy to be paid to their families. Government banned documentary in India to save its image abroad, what a joke. The judiciary in India is failing since new government interfered to set free all Gujarat riots accused.

                            Justice must be made and the guilty ones like Mukesh must be given the highest punishment as per law but at the same time the innocent sons of India must be considered. At this moment this documentary is causing a huge embarrassment to the innocent sons of India. Now because of such documentaries, already our culture is called as Rape Culture??? By what standards and yardsticks a society is deemed to have a rape culture?? Yes it is an epidemic and major severe epidemic that must be addressed with iron fist and thumped down. But it is certainly not a culture, the Indian expats are working hard to build a positive image of India in this world but tags such as 'Rape Culture' to our society are not helpful and neither they are true. Already a story is published on HuffPost India and validated that shows how one Indian male student was denied admission to an university class in Germany. Just as every Muslim is not a terrorist, every son of India is not a rapist. And Rana, you are blatantly hypocrite...you are okay to support the Muslim Rapist Son of India but not support a ban that is making life impossible for innocent Sons of India

                            India's daughter-real reflection of what society thinks: Udwin:   While on India's Daughter, the film's producer Leslee Udwin has said the banned documentary is "a real reflection" of what society thinks.<br/><br/>
"It's a real reflection of what society thinks. And, you know, in a sense, there's nothing surprising about those comments. This is a society that treats girls as unequal from the day they are born. It treats them as unwelcome when they are born," Udwin said in an interview to the PBS news channel.<br/><br/>
"Sweets are distributed in celebration at the birth of a boy only, and a girl is a disappointment. And from that moment in her life onward, she continues to be discriminated against. Her value is far, far less than that of a boy. Of course, you will end up with a society in which men think they can do what they like with women because they have no worth," she said. <br/><br/>
Wow. the entire Indian society is now biased against women according to Ms Udwin. Brilliant of NDTV and other TV channels that hate the current ruling dispensation to provide a platform which allows a foreigner to come here and stereotype us. <br/><br/>
Thank you BJP haters for making sure that all over the world, people think Indians are rapists first.<br/><br/>
This coming from England which killed of millions of Indians of all religious faiths in Bengal in 1940s (just 75 years ago) simply because they thought Indians were not equal. Even funnier is the fact, that women had no rights till 1928 even to vote.<br/><br/>
We Indians are also extremely dumb to value white skin and allow them to treat us like sheep.

The naga mob that lynched the alleged rapist is predominantly christian, which claims itself to be apostles of peace, love and forgiving.

Most hindus can see both sides of the coin some will be for on an issue some against, but when it comes to muslims- uneducated muslims are brute fanatics, and educated muslims like this writer are refined fanatics.

                            BJP baiting (read Hindu baiting) is the favorite pastime of this lady. She should explain how Rajnath Singh is responsible either personally or as Union Home Minister for the lynching. She should go back to school and learn that law and order is a state subject.

                            "It took a day for the information to go down in the public domain that an Indian civilian, not a Bangladeshi, was subjected to savagery rarely seen before." It is not the first time, it happened in 1984 when the homes of sikhs were marked and then attacked by the so noble people of India. A lady named Gurdeep Kaur was gang raped by group of young men who were merely her son's age.It will not stop until the guilty are punished. But the noble people of India rewards them with biggest mandate ever, be it Delhi or Gujrat.

Thanks for throwing light on lynched victims Army Background. Please keep the same respect for Army Men at times falsely accused of rape in Kashmir. Dont cry the minority card then.

                            No doubt the mob lynching should be thoroughly investigated and the culprits apprehended. However even if the alleged rapist is found to be from family with army background or an Indian national should not have any bearing on the criminal case against him..you maybe the son of India but If you do the crime you do the time...stick to facts Ms Journalist instead of stoking passions.thank you

                            The reason for ban is:<br/>
1) It has shown the identity of the victim<br/>
2) Derogatory remark by rapist proudly saying he has done right thing. This will encourage all boarder line people looking for rape. -:(<br/>
3) Objectionable remark by defence lawyer suggesting girls not to come out after evening. <br/>
Shame on those people who are supporting this documentary. You do not have mother and sister in your house.

                            Rana ayyub says she has an issue with the documentary as it dint do justice to the victim. Then rest of the page is used for 1) Blaming BJP , Modi, Rajnath etc all for some recent crimes 2) Repeat the cleched "majority is predators &amp; particular minority is all victims " statement in various forms.<br/>
Pity she still introduce herself as the writer of one unpublished book on PM. S

                            BBC should do a documentary on Indian corrupt money in the foreign accounts and then I would believe that they are honestly looking out for India's interest.  But this will never happen and you need to guess the reasons...

                            I am not affiliated with any party or groups but seeing Rana on TV I can see that she would have not too much kind things for the current government and any affiliates.  I am looking for impartial people's options.
