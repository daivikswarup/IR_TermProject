Headline::::Mani-Talk: Modi Kissed Parliament, But Disrespects it



DateTime::::2014-12-22T14:49:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Most bullies are cowards. What else could be the explanation for Modi refusing to come before the Rajya Sabha for five full days? He is after all a renowned orator. He also claims to be in full command of his ranks. Why then allow five days of legislative business in which his government has a vested interest to be indefinitely postponed only because he shies away from being held responsible by the House for the lapses of his legislators and ministers? He is, after all, not just the Prime Minister. He is also a Member of Parliament. And it is his first business to be available in the House when Parliamentary business demands his presence. Even the meanest and smallest of us have to heed a three-line whip. What could be more important for nurturing our democracy than a Prime Minister who believes it is his duty to sit in the House, listen to the debate and then defend himself as best as he can?My mind flies back more than half a century to my first visit to the Lok Sabha. The year was 1960. The month, I seem to remember, was February. A friend far better connected than I, as a small-town hick could hope to be, had secured passes for himself and a few friends to attend a debate in Parliament. The debate was on the most exciting event of the time - the dismissal by the Union government under Jawaharlal Nehru of the first-ever elected Communist government in history, the government of Chief Minister EMS Namboodiripad in Kerala. The State government had nationalized all schooling in the state. Since many of the educational institutions were run by Christians, including the 2,000-year-old Syrian Christian community, there was outrage at this abrupt end to private education which had propelled Kerala to the first position in school and college education in the country. People had taken to the streets in large numbers, and Indira Gandhi, as President of the Congress, had seized the opportunity to lead the protestors. As public order broke down, Nehru's government resorted to President's rule. The motion before the House was to debate the merits of the action taken. The Nehru government was clearly on the back-foot.The bus we took from college deposited us at the Parliament House bus-stand, which was then sited at the very spot where Mahatma Gandhi's statue is now seated. We took our place in the Visitors' Gallery and then listened spell-bound to Comrade SA Dange flailing Nehru and the Congress for the error of their ways. He was listened to in pin-drop silence, Nehru in deep thought just in front of him and the Treasury benches in disciplined decorum, writhing in their seats but not interrupting or erupting into slogans. Dange ended his speech in words that reverberate in my memory 50 years and more later. Comparing Nehru to Yudhishthira, whose chariot always rode above the ground for he never told a lie, Dange recalled that when Yudhishthira was persuaded to tell the white lie that Ashwatthama was dead - misleading Dronacharya to believe his son had died when in fact it was the elephant, Ashwatthama, that had been killed - Yudhishthira's chariot fell to the ground. So, said Dange, had Nehru's chariot fallen to the ground with this one action of his. Nehru then rose to reply. I remember nothing of his rebuttal. What remains in memory is of the doughty warrior fully observing Parliamentary protocol and democratic proprieties by giving the others every chance to have their say, and taking their barbs on his chest, before rising to defend his actions. That is what we have been expecting of Modi. But he has shown himself to be indifferent to democratic practice and contemptuous of Parliament - or merely just frightened of public reprimand  - to come to the House and bear like a man "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune". Instead, he has simpered - rushing off to Kashmir to campaign when he should have been facing the House. A sign, perhaps, of how nervous he is that the J&K elections will signal the end of the Modi wave.I recall too finding, in the middle of the Kargil war, on the back page of The Hindustan Times of 26 October 1962, a small news item informing readers that the leader of the Jan Sangh in the Rajya Sabha, one Atal Behari Vajpayee, then all of 36 years of age, had called on the Prime Minister, then 72, twice Vajpayee's age, to demand that although the Lok Sabha was in recess, the Rajya Sabha be called immediately to discuss the then ongoing war on the India-China border. Unlike Vajpayee 1999, who refused a similar request, Nehru agreed with alacrity. The Rajya Sabha was summoned on 8 November 1962 and young Vajpayee launched into a vitriolic attack on the Prime Minister that the Prime Minister of the day bore with his usual dignity and then responded to with Parliamentary punctiliousness. If that 'Gentle Colossus', as Hiren Mukherjee described him, had not thus nurtured democratic institutions, India today, like all 150 countries that have come to liberation since our Independence, might also be floundering like neighbouring Pakistan. Modi does not seem to realize how fragile is the plant of Parliamentary democracy. Perhaps he does not even want to tend the plant so that he can always and all times have his own way, just like all the authoritarians who disfigure the pages of history. However that may be, the fact is that the Prime Minister has refused to heed the majority call in the Upper House that he come to Parliament to listen to what his fellow-Parliamentarians have to say about the conduct of his Partymen, his backbenchers and his Ministers. He considers his Home Minister as his inferior in everything but responding to Parliament!Nehru, on the other hand, had never flinched from his democratic duty. Whether it was the jeep scandal in the early years of Parliament or the Mundhra scandal that rocked the House in 1957-58 at his own son-in-law's instance, there would be Nehru sitting at his appointed place in the House, ever willing to listen with quiet dignity to whatever was hurled at him and to respond in measured tones to whatever had been alleged. More - to take action. For he had suspended in 1952 the first Congress MP charged with manipulating the stock market and then had removed his much-favoured Finance Minster, TTK, for the sins of Mundhra. He even allowed Lal Bahadur Shastri to follow his conscience when, as Railway Minister, Shastri resigned over a rail accident at Ariyalur in distant Tamil Nadu.Modi prefers to cling to his discredited colleagues. A man accused of rape continues to adorn his Council of Ministers. The intemperate Giriraj Singh, who wants all those who do not vote for Modi to be hounded out to Pakistan, is rewarded with a Ministerial assignment. A lady who does not deserve the name of lady because of her preference for filthy language remains on her perch. A back-bencher, swathed in a sadhu's robes, who appears to have more of the Devil than God on his tongue, is allowed, indeed encouraged, to get on with nonsense directed against another religious community.This is what the country has got from voting in a die-hard RSS pracharak as Prime Minister. His extremist cohorts receive the Prime Minister's protection because they speak the Prime Minister's thoughts. We have never had a more dangerous threat to our national unity than this authoritarian who little respects the sanctum sanctorum of our democracy despite having hypocritically kissed its doorstep when first stepping into its sacred precincts.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mr Mani, you need help, we understand your state of mind is not good.You cannot see Congress beyond the "Nehru &amp; his family". Did India take freedom from the British to be slaves of the Nehru family ? If you wish to be their slaves, so be it. Sorry rest of India today, does not believe so. We have choosen Modi and you better respect that. If Modi does not deliver, he will also face the music.<br/>
Regarding Conversion, if you are against it, then support the govt for a strong Anti Coversion Bill. All conversions must be legally registered. It is difficult to achieve that in India (since all vehicles are registered today) hope fully the conversion nos will be far less than that.<br/>
Please do not waste tax payers money in the Parliment by stalling debates &amp; discussions. Else next time, congress might be reduced to single digit in Parliment. We do not want Congress or their men to fight for so called secularism. We want progress. Please get it clear in your head, which is loaded with crap

                            The last thing India needs is a lesson in democracy from Moron Shankar Aiyer.  Readers with short memories need reminding that this is the moron who decreed that the Prime Ministership of the country was Rahul's and Priyanka's 'for the asking'.  No need for them to go through the democratic process of actually winning an election.  Modi does not need lessons in Parliamentary proprietary from this moron.  To put matters in perspective, moron's credentials are nothing to write home about.  He was a babu who fled babudom to become a full-time arse kisser to the non-entity Rajiv Gandhi.  Indeed readers will be aware that moron has written a 4 volume tome titled 'Memories of Rajiv'.  Anybody else would have needed just two words to sum up Rajiv's achievements in life; 'bugger all'.  As far as his gushing characterisation of Nehru is concerned, it is the same Nehru who through the nepotism exercised by Gandhi became PM over the head of Patel; not much democracy there!  It was when Nehru was PM that millions of Hindus and Muslims were slaughtered in the partition of our nation.  And what was the democratic, wise, Nehru up to?  Was he drafting his resignation and preparing to broadcast an apology to the nation?  Of course not!  He was at that very time fornicating with Edwina Mountbatten!  Nehru's dreadful incompetence, indeed criminal negligence is even today being covered up.  I am of course referring to the deaths of thousands of Indian soldiers who laid down their lives in the ill fated war with China initiated by moron's hero Nehru. As far as various people who are in Modi's government or party is concerned, does Modi really want to take lessons from a character who was part of a Government that has Shibbu Soren (accused of murder), Lalu (convicted and jailed for fraud), Raja (Mr 2 G himself)? Does Modi really want to take lessons from a character who kisses the backside of an Italian waitress with close links to Mafiosi like Quatrocchi?  Of one thing the nation can be sure; Modi will not take a blind bit of notice of what moron says, does or thinks.  Modi has the democratic mandate of the nation.  Moron does not.  Modi has the love of the nation. Moron does not.  Modi is not a coward; moron is.  Modi is a household name in the country.  Moron is a household name in his own mind.

                            Why just compare to Nehru? What happened to other Congress Prime Minister? Talking about democratic values? What happened under Indira Gandhi's rule? Modi at least is not clipping democracy's wings.

Now you are just criticisng each and every action of Modi, because of your differences with BJP, especially with Modi you are not able ro digest about Modi being the PM of India.

                            First, Agra Conversion is too small an issue to keep all other House business aside. Second, it comes under purview of state Home departments &amp; not center. Third, SP supremo Mulayam Sing Yadav on behalf of Opposition in LS called it a non-issue. Fourth, Central Home minister's reply is enough. PM needs to reply on very critical issues. Remember MMS saying "Hazaron Jawaabon se acchh hai meri Khaamoshi.... even in face of Massive scams like 2G, Coal, CWG !! <br/>
Mani is being prudish about Damage to Democracy. He has conveniently erased from his memory the black period of Emergency. Also the Shouting Brigade of Rajiv Gandhi which used to hoot out the opponents when he had 425+ MPs in LS.

                            Rajyasabha is nothing but house for politicians who doesn't have any people support and can't win election on there own. Also its ATM for political parties, to sell RS ticket to businessmen and makes money.<br/><br/>
Real objective of Rajasabha was to nominate highly intelligent and professional persona who normally don't like to fight election. And thus take advantage of there services / knowledge just like USA President has power to nominate / select his own team even from outside politicians and not necessary to win Senate election. <br/><br/>
Now Rajyasabha is becoming khichdi and mostly useless politicians who even doesn't have 1% of support from populations can become MP by RS.

                            Problem in India is, Majority Community according to the secular "Oxbridge" morons should always be at the receiving end and should be taken for granted and should not be allowed for any kind of course correction. <br/>
When Conversions happen from Hinduism to other Religions, no hue and cry and "secularism is at risk" clamour arises. But few re-conversions, and expansion of the Hindu identity brings all the News channels, Editors, journalisms to a first page news, as if whole country is in disarray and everything will fall apart. When Paletinians are killed in Israeli onslaught, almost every political party held rallies, meetings, street corners condemning Israel and garnering votes from a particular community. But when ISIS kills 10 times more children, men and recently 150 women, including pregnant ones, no party would risk any protests, fearing the vote bank might be disillusioned and News channel keep opn harbouring these hypocrites.

                            GREAT ARTICLE...THANK YOU MR. MANI. It MADE ME REMEMBER THE MAGICAL DAYS OF OUR INDEPENDENCE. I was 15 yrs old.It was a great privilege to have heard Nehru.All those stalwarts of Congress were truly great men.They had sacrificed their lives for the sake of the country...Gained independence from the foreign yoke without shedding blood.Gandhi,Nehru, Patel, Ambedker and many more. etc.It was the first time a democratic Govt by our own leaders was put in place .Before the British...only kings ruled and there were so many kingdoms.The British united and called the nation INDIA AS WE KNOW NOW.all were made equal and we had the privilege of growing up where there was peace and harmony between the various communities.The CONGRESS GOVT HAD ACHIEVED GREAT AND TREMENDOUS THINGS...SURELY THEY MADE MISTAKES.but THE REFORMATIONS THEY BROUGHT INTO SOCIETY WAS COMMENDABLE.i HAVE SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES HOW THE DALITS WERE TREATED WORSE THAN ANIMALS..Untouchability AND THE CASTE SYSTEM .BJP TALK OF HINDUTVA...IF BJP GO THE WAY THEY ARE GOING India WILL BECOME LIKE PAKISTAN...I TREMBLE FOR MY GREAT COUNTRY...WHERE EVER MODI CAMPAIGNS HE INCITES THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE NEHRU FAMILY...ITS PATHETIC...HE SAYS TAKE REVENGE ON THE GANDHIS..punish them.FATHER/SON DYNASTIES IN KASHMIR..IS HE TRYING TO BRING IN A FRENCH TYPE OF REVOLUTION?.IN HIS CAMPAIGNS hE CAN EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE ALL THE GOOD HE IS GOING TO DO...AND NOT BELITTLE OTHERS..hE IS ALWAYS INSULTING...YET HE DOESNOT HAVE THE COURAGE TO FACE PARLIAMENT..HE IS TOO ARROGANT TO APOLOGISE..PROTECTS HIS ERRING LYING AND HATE-SPEWING  COLLEAGUES..WHAT HAVE THE POOR CHRISTIANS DONE...THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PEACEFUL LAW-ABIDING COMMUNITY..THEY HAVE DONE ONLY GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY.WHY ALL THIS DRAMA OF CONVERSIONS..RECONVERSIONS...THE WHOLE WORLD MUST BE LAUGHING AT US..WE SHOULD LEARN FROM HISTORY..LET NOT OUR COUNTRY BECOME LIKE HITLERS GERMANY..THE WAR,THE HOLOECAST THE DEFEAT ,THE COUNTRY... NOT SPLIT INTO TWO BUT MAY BE INTO TWO DOZENS.MAY HEAVEN HELP OUR COUNTRY AND SAVE US FROM THESE FANATICS...THEY SEEM TO BE AS FANATICAL AS THE TERRORISTS.TO See them destroying the secular fabric of our country IS HEARTBREAKING.WHAT IS SADDER IS THAT EDUCATED PEOPLE LIKE JAITLEY ARE SILENT TO WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY.WHAT IS THE MEANING OF MODI ADDRESSING THE STUDENTS ON TEACHERS dAY ...THAT DAY WAS TO HONOUR TEACHERS NOT STUDENTS NOR MODI..THEN THIS GOOD GOVERNANCE DAY ON CHRISTMAS DAY...WHAT A MEAN ,PETTY THING TO DO..THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD CELEBRATE GOOD GOVERNANCE DAY IN THE PARLIAMENT BECAUSE THEY ONLY NEED TO LEARN IT FIRST AND GIVE THE PEOPLE GOOD GOVERNANCE.

                            Mr. Aiyyar, What about Indira Gandhi the daughter of Nehru? You have eulogized Nehru so much for building the democratic institutions. What about the democratic credentials of Nehru's dear daughter and his successor? Indira manipulated and destroyed every democratic norm, practice and institutions, which ultimately culminated in the emergency she imposed on this country. She started the "chamcha" culture in Indian politics and installed her sycophants as chief ministers of states. Not to mention the no. of times she removed elected state governments. Why not mention about her democratic practices when you impose your love of the Gandhis on our nation.

                            The article is a good read on the history dignified political debates in parliament, which form the very backbone of any democracy. However, pointing just one individual for not respecting the sanctity of parliament, as the situation prevailing in parliament these days, is neither fair nor correct. The examples given in decorum are of an era when legistative bodies were respectful places which had some really deserving political stalwarts from all kind of political parties. Nehru was a true statesmen in every sense. But today, each party can claim to be at top spot for disrespecting parliament. Parliament debates are slugfest of voracious vocal cords (and on special occasions of muscles and money). In such a scenario, you cant hold one individual responsible for defiling sanctity of parliament. All parties are equally responsible. As a senior political figure, one would expect leaders to have balanced opinions, which this article is lacking.

                            Dear Mr. Aiyar,<br/><br/>
Since you have been talking about respecting the 'sanctum sanctorum of our democracy', will you please answer the following questions?<br/><br/>
1. Starting with the debate that you witnessed, do I understand that in your book its perfectly acceptable for a Prime Minister to dismiss a legitimately elected state government for political gain, as long as he participates in a debate over the topic?<br/><br/>
2. Talking of Modi holding on to discredited colleagues, would you please explain how people like Sajjan Kumar/ Jagdish Tytler, who were actively involved in inciting pogroms continued receiving election tickets from your own party? I suppose such blatant communalism did not threaten our national unity, as far as you're concerned.<br/><br/>
3. How was the 'fragile plant' of parliamentary democracy by imposing a state of national emergency, which resulted in suspension of all human rights for nearly 2 years? I suppose gagging all dissent, forcibly sterilising people, etc was the Congress way of nurturing that fragile plant.<br/><br/>
4. It was your hero Rajiv Gandhi's foolish pandering to extremist elements among both communities in the late 80s that poisoned the communal atmosphere. Why then do you lose no opportunity to sing praises of Mr. Gandhi and equally, condemn Mr. Modi?<br/><br/>
How do I interpret your comments? Selective memory or blatant hypocrisy?

                            I hate Mani Shankar Aiyar, but I love the way he writes. I am going to copy his phrases and use them to propagate Thoughts of Hindutva.

                            Can anyone kindly enlighten me why a Congress member, who had been minister in various Congress govts, ne NOMINATED to Rajya Sabha? He is not under Congress quota of any state. He is one out of 12 nominated memebrs who supposedly excel in social and literary fields.

                            Modi kissed the parliament that was he show business but he has proved that he and his partymen does not believed in Indian constitution based on Secularism. He has proved that may be he is good Hindu but he is not a good Indian.

                            For once I am beginning to agree with Mr. Aiyar. The events which have started unfolding and the latest ploy of the NDA in asking for an all party consensus for a canny law against forcible conversions has started turning people like me, who voted for Modi's governance agenda, against his party and the ideology which he seems to be espousing in a very implicit way. Modi seems to be revealing in quiescent ways the true colours of his development. Radical conversion melas all over from UP to Gujarat. Ministers openly talking about Godse. A BJP subsidiary organisation asking for Godse's statues to be erected all over the country. Ministers seething communal invectives. The HRD minister tweaking the curriculum to suit the Hindu ideology demands. The external affairs minister wanting Gita as the national book!The PM absent from parliament. His second in command shading all the right wing elements by refusing to comment! Was congress communal in its approach. The answer to that is hell yes!!! But this is the road towards chaos and direct confrontation! Does he want all other ethnicities to vanish??? Is this how we're achieving development? Sabka Saath?? Forgotten!!!!! No difference between these idiots and those mullahs in Pakistan ! We're on the road to saffronization and let there be no doubt left in that! Misled......yet again!!! This time lied to brazenly!!!!! What a shame!!!
