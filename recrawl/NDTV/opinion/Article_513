Headline::::Where Rahul Gandhi Travels is Immaterial; Judge His Performance as an Opposition Leader



DateTime::::2015-04-18T23:15:00+05:30



(Pawan Khera is a political analyst with the Congress party.)
On the eve of the Mazdoor Kisan Khet rally, called to protest against the proposed dilution of the Land Acquisition Act, Rahul Gandhi met representatives of farmers' groups from Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.
His first public appearance since he returned from his much talked about sabbatical, this can also be called his expression of intent on the kind of issues he would like the Congress to put its weight behind.
The narrative around him and his sabbatical dominated media space for long. The Congress party had issued a statement announcing approval of his leave of absence. It is said that the best way to keep a secret in Delhi is to go public with it. In the case of Rahul Gandhi however, the level of curiosity crossed all intelligent limits with a hyper-speculative media hounding the party's spokespersons demanding to know where he was and what was he doing. As if this detail was even relevant.
The flippant narrative reflects the kind of issues that interest our newsrooms and television studios.
The government at the Centre changed in May 2014. India is now going through a regime change. This change reflects itself in the manner in which the state and its sponsored non-state actors interfere in what we eat, what we watch in multiplexes, what we read in text books, how we dress up, who we marry and how many children should we as Hindus, Muslims and Christians give birth to. The nation has every reason to be anxious about the future of, and impatient with the current status of the leading opposition party - the Indian National Congress. The party itself is going through a generational transition at several levels - having witnessed its worst ever performance in the electoral history of India. These are not normal times. Times like these throw more questions than answers.
Those who are labeling demands for Sonia Gandhi to continue as Congress President as a "mutiny" against Rahul Gandhi are victims of the Narendra Modi kindergarten of thought - where there can only be one leader at the top.
It is surprising that even an innocent expression of confidence in Sonia Gandhi is twisted as a no confidence motion against Rahul Gandhi. Praise for Sonia Gandhi does not at all mean criticism for Rahul Gandhi - one has worked hard to earn the praise while the other is yet to be in a position where he can prove his mettle.
There certainly are different voices in the party representing different age groups, experiences and visions. Different voices do not reflect differences; they only reflect good health of an organization. Just because no one dares to voice a different opinion other than the Prime Minister's, does not mean Narendra Modi has an all-round acceptance.
The moment a political party forms the government, the responsibility of upholding democratic imperatives gets transferred to the opposition. Rahul Gandhi is not only the voice of those who did not vote for this government but also of those who did not vote for the Congress. Just as, once elected, the Prime Minister is the Prime Minister of every single Indian, so is true for the leaders of the main opposition party. His task is cut out neat and clear - to ensure the voices of all those he represents reach the government and his own voice reaches those he hopes to represent.
Over the past couple of years, in the run-up to the elections we witnessed a very obvious display of ambition wrapped in ostentatious packaging and articulated in brassy rhetoric. The vast aspirational population of the country was treated as a consumer and politics reduced to a transaction. The country is now realizing that those who had claimed to have all the answers do not even know the right questions. Rahul Gandhi has been honest about not knowing the answers. He asks the right questions though.
We live in a land of wide disparities and mind-boggling contradictions. India cannot survive if its rulers operate in the either-or spectrum - either industry or agriculture; either rich or poor; either environment or development; either state or civil society; either Hindus or minorities; either me or us. The Congress Party under Rahul Gandhi needs to put the moral compass of our politics back to normal.
The present government headed by Mr Narendra Modi has been liberal in handing out issues to the opposition inside and outside of Parliament. Dilution of the Land Acquisition Act, weakening of the RTI, subverting PIL activism, infringement of citizens' right to pursue different lifestyles, polarization, both communal and economic, are factors that have the potential to damage the core of India's self-image. The performance of both, the government and the opposition constantly gets scrutinized by the voter.
While the UPA was in power, as one of the important leaders of the Congress Party, Rahul Gandhi made interesting interventions which had far reaching consequences on rural wages, tribal rights, debarring those convicted from contesting elections, and a judicious land acquisition law.
When will Rahul Gandhi become the Congress President is an irrelevant debate. He has a historical role to play in shaping the future of the Congress Party and India. Rahul Gandhi needs to be judged by his performance as one of the most important leaders of the opposition, not by what he wears, where he travels, how he meditates and what he eats. A leader is judged by the position he or she takes on critical issues and not by the position he or she occupies. Rahul Gandhi should be judged on the basis of his position on the issues thrown up by the government of the day.
With his personalized pinstriped suit, fake LV shawl and ramp walk diplomacy, though he makes it difficult for us, the country is also waiting to judge Mr Narendra Modi with the same yardstick.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mr. Khera, perhaps Rahul Gandhi's best bet is that we judge him by his travels. If we judge him by his performance he's toast.

                            First of all lets get one thing clear which is he is NOT the Opposition leader. Secondly even if he is the leader of a virtually non existent Congress party, he needs to be present in the country to perform as an opposition and not go away on ridiculously long holidays that too during the most important budget session of parliament. Though slaves will always speak up for their shehzada.

                            Yes Rahul Gandhi has "a historical role to play". He will single handedly bring down Congress (with background support from the likes of Mani Shankar Iyer, Digvijay Singh, etc). <br/><br/>
It is funny that you mention that "Rahul Gandhi is not only the voice of those who did not vote for this government but also of those who did not vote for the Congress", but also he should be "judged on the basis of his position on the issues". Hello sir, Mr Gandhi is barely present in the parliament. When he does attend, he is caught sleeping. Last year, he asked only 1 question. Not only has he failed as a leader. He has even failed as a parliamentarian.

The hard fact is you have made yourselves irrelevant and if continue sticking to the same old leaders you make us feel very much disenfranchised because you take away an alternative in the political space to the current government.

                            Little Khera has mixed up being a political analyst with being a sycophant.  It IS important to know where a potential Prime Minsiter is at any point in time.  When severe weather hit farmers, Ra Ga was in Thailand doing a bit of Chintan!  If he is PM and Pakistan launches an attack, will he bugger off to Thailand to do more chnitan?  Khera alludes to his performance as an opposition leader.  Really?  What performance?  What is his attendance record?  How many times has he spoken?  How many questions has he asked?  Is Khera referring to the famous episode when RaGa went to sleep in Parliament or is he referring to the time when the little fellow went into the well of the house?  Khera, you must do better than just fart out a few words; respect the NDTV readers and give a better analysis!

                            These are not normal times? For whom? The Congress party, yes. It is looking down the barrel. For the rest of India, the times could not be better, or more normal. To call the Congress the opposition is a joke. With 44 seats, it is just a bit better than the ADMK or the TMC. Neither of these 3 parties represent any sort of "democratic imperative". They are all run autocratically by their respective leaders. Narendra Modi is the visible face of the BJP and of the Central Government, but there are many others playing equally important roles. The country requires a strong leader. Why was the Congress booted out? Answer that honestly and you will understand why it is highly unlikely that it will ever return to power. If Congress leaders are honest, they are incompetent. The more competent ones were corrupt. No wonder it collapsed. Also, any public leader anywhere in the world can expect scrutiny of his or her actions, public or private. Why all this secrecy about Rahul's sabbatical or Sonia's illness? It is this propensity to hide and cover up that led to so many massive scams during the UPA rule. And to say that Rahul has a historical role to play in shaping India is a sick joke. He has contributed nothing in the past and will not do so in the future. That is a cast iron guarantee. You want to bet Mr. Khera? Name your odds.

And many farmers from the other states would like to hear the discussion held between RG &amp; the farmers, also it shall instill a lot of confidence in many like me who carve for a strong opposition leader, to take on the modi gov for the next 4 years

                            Think how far the Congress has fallen from the Nehru days. The only real qualification Rahul has is that he is he carries Nehru's genes. In terms of protesting and destroying, he has done an average job. In terms of constructing and alleviating poverty, he has done a terrible job. Congress took in a roaring economy in 2004 and destroyed it by 2014. I would entrust the nation to the BJP and Modi any day, than to Congress and Rahul.

                            One para in this blog says "While the UPA was in power, as one of the important leaders of the Congress Party, Rahul Gandhi made interesting interventions which had far reaching consequences on rural wages, tribal rights, debarring those convicted from contesting elections, and a judicious land acquisition law".<br/>
If Khera wants to give credit to Mr. Rahul Gandi for the above said "GOOD THINGS" during UPA I &amp; II, the writer must explain, what prevented Mr Rahul Gandhi from stopping various scams in their tracks- CWG, 2G, 3G, Coal gate,etc., from taking place. It would have done a great deal of good to the NG dynasty and its sycophants in INC. At the least, he could not dissuade his own brother-in-law from indulging controversial land purchases in Haryana and Rajasthan.The write up is vague and point less to waste readers' time.

Then I am sure, author's family will also disown him.Amazing he found some thing intelligent in Rahul which the entire country including majority of Congress party missed so far.

                            I feel that judging the performance of Mr.Rahul at this stage doesn't make any sense. He has no leader qualities because when UPA was in power, he used to sit in back benches and sleep and throw the documents prepared by PM. <br/><br/>
During the Parliament session goes on vacation instead of listening and raising points in the interest of Nation, but they have interest for their own selfish goals.<br/><br/>
Throw him from party as well as politics.

Why don't you stand fior congress president post as Sonia madam has become aged and rahulji is not as capable like you sir as he rejected many many times when Manmohanji offered him cabinet minister post as he is very sure he cannot perform and opted to work for part but the aged and old and powerful congress leaders close to Sonia do not want Rahul as he will throw the old ones out. Sir do you have the courage to lead as President of congress. If you are not in a position to be president of congress , please do not push Rahul as opposition leader in parliament as Rahul said he only can only work for party. SIR, if you cannot be president  if congress PLEASE DO MOT PUSH RAHUL , DO YOU UNDERSTAND.
