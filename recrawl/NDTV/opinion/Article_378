Headline::::A Bharat Ratna for Mahatma Gandhi?



DateTime::::2015-01-28T03:36:00+05:30



(Dorab R Sopariwala is Editorial Adviser at NDTV and writes on political and economic issues.)Thank you, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Thank you, Baba Ramdev, Thank you, Ranjit Savarkar. The first two declined to accept Padma awards, while the third felt that his forbearer, Veer Savarkar, did not need an award for recognition. What a refreshing change!  For several decades, we have known that the civilian "honours" system is broken. A noted sportsperson recently claimed an honour almost as a matter of right and 'seniority' (that old Indian disease) because another sportsperson had received it. And then a Bollywood grandee turned down an honour offered to him on a similar ground.  The system has been corrupted and debased and we have now come to a sorry pass. Does a republic really need such an elaborate system of honours? After all, in a republic, we are all supposed to be equal.  I am not sure all Indians know that, for the first three years of the Republic, we had no state awards. Then, the old disease crept back in 1954. It would be unrealistic to think that we can turn the clock back - but can we at least try and improve this system before it becomes a laughing stock and brings embarrassment upon all of us?  As a starting point, may I suggest three simple rules in the form of questions? Question 1 - Who should be eligible for these awards? These awards are for public service, e.g. for arts and culture, for education, for service to society, etc. Should sports fall in this category? Sports give us pleasure, entertainment, joy and even pride. But I would not say that it is public service. Moreover, sportspersons already have their separate awards - the Arjuna Awards, the Khel Ratna Awards, the Dronacharya Awards. In addition, they get their medals, their prizes, their endorsements and public acclaim. Moreover, their associations (the IOC, the BAI, etc.) can honour them. Let us see how other some other countries honour their sportspersons. Take the case of US swimmer Michael Phelps. He has won 18 gold medals (not to forget four silvers) at the Olympics - that is twice as many as all of India has won in the 100-odd years it has been competing (9 in all - 8 in hockey and 1 by Abhinav Bindra). And has Phelps been honoured by the US? No. His home state of Maryland has twice awarded him the "Order of DUI"! DUI meaning caught driving under the influence of alcohol and punished. Of course, as is right, this multiple gold medalist has been honoured by the US Olympic Committee and other sporting bodies - but no state honours.  And here we have silver medalists asking for state awards as a matter of right. What great 'state' honours have been bestowed on Roger Federer, who has won 17 Grand Slams, no less! Donald Bradman, a better-than-average cricketer by any reckoning, and Garfield Sobers, a pretty good all-rounder, were each given just a Knighthood - among the lowest grade in the British system of honours. Alex Ferguson, during whose tenure Manchester United won 37 trophies, also got just a Knighthood. Among our cricketers, we have people spanning the entire spectrum of honours!   So, let sporting bodies reward and award great sportspersons. I concede that it is impractical in India to not give Padma honours to sportspersons. But can we at least severely restrict their numbers to 1-2 annually, in favour of those who render great public service - often without recognition or financial benefits? Question 2. Should awards be given posthumously? In his speech at the burial of Caesar, Mark Antony said: "The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones". Following that simple principle - if one isn't good enough to get a state award when one is alive, then one should not get it when one has departed. As Ranjit Savarkar, referring to the possibility of a posthumous Bharat Ratna for Veer Savarkar, said: "I feel they should keep great leaders out of award politics .... There is no end to the list of names" (Indian Express, January 25, 2015). However, in the past, honours have been bestowed upon the departed. In the 2015 list also, out of 106 honours, five are posthumous. In fact, out of the 45 Bharat Ratnas awarded since 1954, around a dozen have been posthumous awards (the posthumous one to Lal Bahadur Shastri is in a class by itself - for he died while serving the nation).  This year, we hit a new low when we began awarding people who died before India became a republic (i.e. those who lived in a British Bharat) like Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya. This may open the gates to all kinds of other names.  If Malaviya, the Didi will ask: what about Tagore, a Nobel Prize winner, who returned his Knighthood after Jalianwala Bagh? And Uddhavji will ask: how dare we forget Shivaji? And what about Emperor Akbar? And why not the great poet Thiruvalluvar and the great writer Munshi Premchand? And surely Jhansi ki Rani? And Tansen? And Jamsetji Tata? And Emperor Ashok? And how can we leave out Raja Raja Chola I and Chandragupta Maurya? And how about Chanakya and Aryabhatta? And Shahid Bhagat Singh? And the great Maharaja Ranjit Singh? And the mathematical genius sans pareil Srinivas Ramanujan? And Tipu Sultan? And the physicist J C Bose? And, in this year of 'nari shakti', what about Lord Bentinck and Raja Rammohan Roy who worked to suppress 'sati'? As Ranjit Savarkar suggests, the list is endless. So, if we do not put a stop to this, over the years to come, our political masters could lead us to the ultimate debasement and award 50 Bharat Ratnas every year to people who died before Independence! We have a large enough stock of great persons stretching over several thousand years to give 50 Bharat Ratnas annually for at least the next 100 years! And the ultimate shame will be when we make Mahatma Gandhi a Bharat Ratna. Looking down dolefully at us from the Elysian Fields, he may well say: "He Ram, is this the India I lived for, fought for .... and died for? Question 3 - How should these awards be given? And how many?  There needs to be a truly independent and unbiased committee that selects the awardees. We now have enough such committees to select all kinds of legal and constitutional functionaries, so let us have one more. There also needs to be a numerical limit on the number of awards to be given. Instead of more than a hundred baubles being distributed every year (106 in 2015), we should restrict the number to, say, 10-15 truly deserving persons every year. This will certainly increase the value of these awards in the eyes of the public. To conclude, I would like to make two points: What does it say for a system of honours that, in 2015, finds 106 deserving cases but has no place (as far as I am aware) for Kailash Satyarthi, the Nobel Peace Prize winner - and the only resident Indian who has that honour. Finally, at every Republic Day, we normally have the sad spectacle of 2-3 women collecting the Ashoka Chakra for the valour that has cost their husbands their lives. As I watch these women, it brings tears to my eyes, a big lump in my throat and great pride in my heart.  I must say that I do not feel even remotely the same at the investiture for Padma Awards winners at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

                            Was having the same feeling while having a look on Padma awards list. The standards are deteriorating year after year. A sportsperson abusing on every single occasion is definitely not an ideal India deserves, at least not in the field of public service. In fact, cricket is not only India's most coveted game, it's pretty much Padma-insured.

                            Very nicely written article. I fully agree with Dorabji that the awards in India have become a conduit to score brownie points by political parties in power. As he rightly pointed out, the list would be endless if one would like to go back in history and pick and choose people to be given the awards. Hope better sense prevails although, as we all know, that will not happen.

                            Doran, how cerminously you have not mentioned Sachin Tendulkar, getting a Bharat Ratna, that just because a great person suggested it after watching him play. I am certainly  not against your view, but when you highlighted the Michel Phelps &amp; Ferguson, we r bound to question Sachin conferment of the Bharat Ratna.

                            These padma awards are jokes, in our country chances of getting awards not depends on achievement/public services it depends on other factors like rich , cricketers/cinema stars, which party in government, political influence. one day we will see rahul gandhi-from Congress, advani from nda, kejrival from aap, mulayam, mamatha banerji, etc getting bharath ratna

                            Sachin should go to a long way to get Bharat Ratna, though it was completely political by Khangress. They are the one set all the bad proceedings and here as well.<br/><br/>
Even after getting the award, it was not nice to see him in water cooler, lighting ads. Bad attendee of parliment, he should have mature enough to deserve this award. He should have been rejected this award, not sure what compelled him to take it

                            These awards have lost all value of late. Of what social or public significance are the achievements of Sachin Tendulkar that he was announced as a recipient on the day he retired? The lesser known names in the list of Padma awardees are well known to influence those in power to add this tag with their name. I know of a company MD who very happily celebrated his 'Padmashri' spending tens of crores of company money on "success functions" when the company was reeling under deep losses and labourers not paid properly owing to deficient funds! Truly a case of money power

                            Sir! A truly well written article and definitely an essential message to ponder upon. But my only question is, why are such articles appearing only when the BJP govt. is in power and why were you all intellectuals quiet when Congress kept awarding almost every tom, dick, harry with just a qualification of being an left liberal, these honors? And what about awarding Mr. Tendulkar with a Bharat Ratna for vote bank? I don't remember reading any article from you regarding that... Agree that change should begin somewhere and thanks you recognize the maturity of Sri Sri, Ramdev and Ranjith Savarkar.

                            Awards should be given to contributions recognized in that particular year. Just like Nobel prize is given to recent significant contribution.  <br/>
Like who influenced the biggest social change, who made lasting impact as an entertainer, who made greatest contribution to science in given year and so on! Classify 10-12 categories &amp; provide 1 award in each. Period.

                            The question is that of "contribution". Nowadays it has come to mean starring in 50 hit films. Or 34000 runs in cricket. Nobody knows whether such people actually took time from their profession and worked on advancing social causes, or even promoting Arts and Sport by managing programs, mentoring and encouraging aspirants in that field. Or indeed, laying down a huge body of scientific or literary work which would provide the impetus. THAT is real contribution.  For example, the likes of Dr Prakash Amte, who has really contributed to the cause of tribals? Is the work of a film personality who are about to receive a Padma Vibhushan even remotely close? I mean, how many Indians even know Dr Prakash Amte ? That is when these awards look completely meaningless.

                            Fully agree with the article Padma and Bharat Ratna has lost its value. Modi government should do something about it and restore its relevance. UPA has already made mockery of Bharat Ratna by conferring it to Sachin Tendulkar whose contribution to the country is running around the field and make billions for himself. I am not belittling sport person but they clearly do not deserve these awards till they have contributed selflessly to the society without monetary benefits involved in those.

                            Perfectly said Dorab ji. First time for the last few days, I have read a meaningful article, that will add productivity to India. Let me also add that those from the Northern &amp; Western part of India get these awards much easier. Those in South keep hitting their knees, and are asked to take a donation of Padma Shri (not to dishonour this award). It would be even good to just consolidate all into just 1 award and grant it once, instead of Shri, Bhushan, Vibhushan, Ratna... and so on.

Congress should be happy even Modi is continuing many of the Cong policies including nuclear deal and awards and economic policy. Instead it is finding fault with him.

                            The article reflects the thinking of most who follow these awards and who feel so helpless and frustrated as the tamasha grows leaps and bounds on a yearly basis. While the fond hope is either to do away with such 'tamasha' or to only award a handful of the most deserving so as to increase the value and merit of the award, the thinking in the corridors of power seems to be wanting to finish them off totally altogether by being reckless in awarding so that the whole thing can get a natural closure. In other words, putting a stop to the 'tamasha'! Which by itself maybe a good thing - same objective - but the route to achieving it is slightly different!! If these are awards are not there, then there is one less opportunity to be made fun of. One less opportunity to make a fool of ourselves. This is the way one is forced to be a realist in contemporary India. Because, for instance, hoping for "a truly independent and unbiased committee that selects the awardees", is all a pipe dream. All of us know for sure such a thing is not possible in our great nation, now or ever.

                            Brilliant article!  I have very low hope that our political masters will listen and learn from this, but I certainly do wish.

                            After reading this article I have just this to say scrap the awards which are actually coming across as rewards. The Defense Force awards need not be disturbed. The Civilian honours leave it to the various bodies like for sport IOA, for Science Indian Science Congress etc which already exist in many cases. and one rarest of rare award That can be called the Indian Presidential Medal or call it Indian Rashtrapati Purskar.

                            If they award *Bharat Ratna* to the father of the nation Mahtma Gandhi after so many years and after so many have been awarded including Rajiv Gandhi/  Indira Gandhi etc .....It is not an honour but insult to Mahatma ji... he deserves much more than politically biased awards and   *bharat Ratna*

                            Dorab Ji, Hats off to your very thought provoking views. As millions of Indians can't enjoy their 'Paan" without the important ingredient associated with your name, many an Indians must be feeling uncomfortable reading your piece. Watch tomorrow some one might start blurting from the stage, " this guy Sopariwala is praising the American system so much let him go to the States". What a sane advice to the insane people!

                            Yes! Yes! An excellent article. It did bring tears to my eyes during the ceremony when the wives were collecting the awards because their husbands sacrificed their lives for us.

                            Great say sir. Politicians are making a mockery of the system. Is there a way to bring its lost sheen back.
