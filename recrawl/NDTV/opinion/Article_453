Headline::::BJP Pushing Economy Towards Disaster



DateTime::::2015-03-10T14:49:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha)
	As the Budget figures sink in, the realization grows that by kidding itself, the BJP is presiding over an economy drifting slowly but surely to disaster.
	The flaw essentially lies in the new technique its statistical advisers have provided of calculating GDP. Where all these decades, GDP has been measured at factor cost - that is the cost at which inputs have been obtained - the new GDP series has shifted the basis to the price at which output is marketed. This is in line with standard global practice and, therefore, not to be faulted. The catch, however, is that owing to some yet-to-be-discovered glitch, the growth rate thrown up by the new process is wildly out of sync with the growth figures for the three key sectors of the economy - agriculture, industry and services.
	We saw last week that the growth rate of agriculture has been estimated at a mere 1.1 per cent last year. The same Economic Survey estimates the industrial growth rate to have been 5.9 per cent, a mere 1.4 per cent higher than the previous year and services alone topping double digits with 10.6 per cent, but a mere 1.3 per cent above the previous year.
	How can such modest sectoral growth rates add up to a whopping GDP growth rate of 7.4 per cent, blasting us into being the "fastest-growing economy in the world"? Somewhere, someone has gone wrong.
	But instead of prudently waiting to see how the glitch might be discovered and corrected, the BJP government is rushing headlong into assuming the figure must be correct and basing its Budget on that GDP growth figure. Principally, its revenue estimates are based on the economy growing at around eight per cent a year when, on the old basis, the figure would be closer to six. Such a huge margin of over-estimation will soon reveal itself in much smaller tax revenues and other government receipts than imagined, with the result that six months down the line, when the mid-term survey is prepared and the Revised Estimates have to be projected, the government will be shown up to have been living in cloud-cuckoo land.
	Meanwhile, huge damage would have been inflicted on the poor, damage that will persist even if the avaricious classes have to revise their hopes for a bonanza. This is principally on account of the substantial increase in the transfer of Central tax revenues to the States having been raised from 32 to 42 per cent as per the recommendations of the 14th Financial Commission (the consequence of the UPA-II having so drafted the Terms of Reference of the 14th Financial Commission- and so no credit to Arun Jaitley).
	In itself, the increase in the share of the States is to be welcomed. We do indeed need "cooperative federalism". But such a major change needs preparation, which is why the 14th Financial Commission made the increase conditional on appropriate "institutional arrangements" being worked out between the Centre and the States to ensure a smooth transition. No such institutional arrangements having been made; there is going to be major disruption, particularly in measures to cater to the human development needs of the poor. Let us explain this point in detail.
	First, the share of the States in Central tax revenues might have gone up, but the share of the States in the overall resources of the Centre, tax and non-tax, is in fact projected to marginally decrease from 63 to 62 per cent. With no more money from the Centre at the disposal of the States than they had earlier, States are being conned into believing ki achche din aa gaye hain when the reality is ki wahi burre din badle nahin. Not only will the States have to meet their Plan and non-Plan requirements from the same overall pool of resources, in addition they will have to take over many of the financial responsibilities which were till now being met by the Centre, particularly in the domains of agriculture, gap funding of backward regions, rural (including panchayat) infrastructure, irrigation (major and minor), sanitation, drinking water, health and education, besides a myriad other schemes hitherto partially or totally funded by the Centre. True, their larger share of Central tax revenues will place at their disposal a large source of untied funds which they can deploy as they wish. This would have been all to the good if it had been matched by a similar or equivalent augmentation of total funds at their disposal. But as Jaitley has robbed the States with one hand of what he has so generously given with the other, the States are now saddled with huge additional developmental responsibilities without the financial wherewithal to rise to these new challenges.
	Given that India may, with a slight statistical sleight of hand, have become the "fastest-growing economy in the world", on the UN's Human Development Index we still stagnate around 135th position, virtually the same as it has been through all the long quarter century since 1991 of neo-liberalism. The development model has made the rich unprecedentedly richer and the richest rich beyond their wildest imaginings, but the poor have had to make do with little more than crumbs from the table. We remain, in terms of what really matters - namely, literacy and education; malnutrition and hunger; maternal and infant mortality; unemployment and under-employment; destitution and minimum basic needs - poorer than much of our neighbourhood, far behind most fellow-developing nations,Â  and, on some crucial parameters, equal to or below sub-Saharan Africa.
	The Budget should be, but is not, measured against these parameters. What this Budget has done is to prospectively set us back even further.
	This is not a matter only of sharply-reduced Central allocations for social sector and poverty alleviation programmes, although that is where the rots starts. It lies in the assumption that what the Centre has reduced, the States will make up for. And of their own volition, at that. Is that at all feasible? One, many States have already prepared and passed their budgets. The money now being flung at them without prior preparation will take time to translate into government accounts and turn into spending for the purposes from which the Centre has partially or wholly withdrawn. Second, the temptation will be for many States to use the bonanza for what they see as their priorities within their old figure for total resources, not in any way as a significant additionality. Third, the Centre has lost all or much of its hold on ensuring at least some spending on what must be regarded as "national priorities" - such as education and health. However high-minded a State may be, if its overall budgetary resources have shrunk, why should it suddenly change its priorities and start doing all the (good) things the Centre has hitherto been doing? These, in any case, were being done through the States earlier, but without burdening their exchequer by as much as they are now required to bear.
	Jaitley should have done two things before rushing in where angels fear to tread. First, he should have worked out in consultation with the States at least a modicum of understanding that the additional ten percent they were getting would be spent in the sectors from which the Centre was wholly or partially withdrawing. Second, a cooperative consultative mechanism should have been set up to oversee, at least broadly, that the terms of the Centre-State understanding were being adhered to. Third - and most important - this was the key moment to ensure that "federalism" covers all three Constitutionally-mandated tiers - Centre, States and panchayats/nagarpalikas.
	Sonia Gandhi has memorably said that our federalism requires "a strong Centre, strong States, and strong local governments". Arun Jaitley's budget has massacred the Ministry of Panchayati Raj by slashing its allocation from Rs. 7,000 crore to a mere Rs. 94 crore - the most drastic cut of any Ministry, thereby confirming his and Narendra Modi's bias against the people's participation in governance and towards bureaucratic authoritarianism. In these circumstances, it is ludicrous to talk of "good governance" - for the best governance is self-governance, and this is being extinguished.
	It is precisely because the States failed to live up to their duty of funding the social sectors and poverty alleviation programmes that the Centre resorted to Centrally-Sponsored Schemes (CSS) to finance essential schemes for human resource development. And it was precisely because he perceived how inefficient CSS were if they were implemented by State bureaucracies alone that Rajiv Gandhi ensured Constitutional sanction, sanctity and safeguards for local self-government in every village and every mohalla of this country. That humongous endeavour at making the people of India masters of their own destiny has been disowned by Modi and Jaitley.
	The only good that will come out of it is that they are hastening their own end. The Delhi election has revealed the BJP's Achilles Heel. It is their refusal to give the people their due share in the governance of the country. Jaitley's budget begins the countdown.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Dear Mr. Aiyar, Why do you forget that Congress has got enough time in Goverment to do things. So stop critisizing and saying this was planned under UPA etc. Planning is one things and delivering is another, Congress always failed on Delivery. And by the way still waiting to see you distributing the tea :)

                            Money Ahankar Liar is back, with another master piece. Even after his favourite Thappad party ruling (read ruining) the nation for more than 55 years after independence, he still believes that there is scope for some one else to push our economy towards disaster, especially after the mega scams like 2G, Coal mines scam etc., where the government has lost lakhs of crores (but still, kAPEl noball comes up with 0 loss theory). Unfortunately, his masterpieces continue until he gets something else to do.

This lunatic has no shame and regret for the doings of his masters, on the other hand his colleague and state mate Ponna China has publicly acknowledged that there were shortcomings in the budget by UPA.

Mister, out of these 24 years, YOU (congress) have been ruling for 15+ years. What the heck your part was doing? HDI is not a decode phenomenon. That is the outcome of congress rule of 60+ years. So, it is not that BJP is "pushing" economy in disaster. It is already in disaster - thanks to Congress.

one thing that i have noticed is that, specially the seculars that whatever is happening correct, that is happening automatically e.g. petrol price and no credit goes to modi sarkar and whatever is going wrong that is all because of modi government.

                            Mr.Iyer, here's a sane advice. Why not work on resurrecting Congress rather than finding fault with Modi ALL the time? You're in a party that's dying a slow death. Seriously.....set aside your bad temper and your bloated ego and do something constructive for your party. Makes sense?

What did you do? Did you put laws in place to insure the Dalits, women, adivasi felt secure in their person? No. Did you put laws in place to insure communal riots did not take place? No. Did you put laws in place to not pander to big-business? No. What did you do in last 45 years?

                            The problems raised can be sorted out between center, states and Niti Aayog. If we oppose every change, nothing will change. Better need not come in the way of good. We should move towards states taking ownership for mico-economic aspects and development of their people, whereas Center should looks at macro-economics, startegic aspects, infrastructure and all shared assets. Center probably should have greater role in security and safety and transporation, so that citizens can have a seamless experienced and we have an integrated and modern solution for these basic things.

                            I fail to understand how the state of current economy is worse or going to be worse than it was during UPA II.He never commented at that time.<br/><br/>
Inflation is all time low,  stock market is at all time high, FDI inflows have increased, Foreign exchange reserves are also at all time high, renewed confidence of investors, tourist numbers are at record high, reduced oil import bill, in huge revenues through coal and spectrum auctions, sale of PSU stake at good price, growth in tax collections are  certain. All these factors will collectively  ensure a robust growth of GDP  and economy.I am hopeful that India is going to out perform many countries (probably including china) during the next five years.<br/><br/>
As for as Sri Mani Shanker Iyer is concerned, he failed to spot  Modi wave before May 2014 elections; when he made his famous prediction that a "Chaiwala kabhi PM nahi banega, nahi banega, nahi banega". Therefore readers should not care as his politically motivated "BHAVISHYAVANI" will ultimately turn out to be a joke. Instead of writing anti NaMo and anti NDA articles all the time, he should now spend his valuable time and energy in nursing his Congress party, which is on a ventilator  and being ineffectively treated by its leading family physicians Smt Sonia Gandhi and Sri Rahul Gandhi.

                            In the last election, Mani lost his deposit. After reading this article, let us see if voters change their mind. Looking at his behaviour pattern, he will end up calling the voters fools if he loses his deposit again. He is too old to change his ways.

                            Mr MSA please write an article on the achievements of UPA govt as well during its 10 years. It shall include the numbers for scams related to 2G and 3G spectrum, Coalgate and Commonwealth games. The coal auction alone under NDA will overcome all the figures. I think that will help you decide who is pushing economy on a recovery track and who pushed it back 20 years.

                            The best thing Mr Iyer should now do is to help resurrect his moribund Congress. It is suffering from numerous diseases and old age; and therefore on a ventilator in an ICU. He should urgently join the other Congress leaders to nurse the party to life. So far the party is not responding to the transfusions and medicines administered by its leading family physician Dr. Sonia. Mr. Iyer should request party's another family physician Dr. Rahul to bring a few "jali booti" from  Italy and or some other country (to which he is on a vacation during his sabbatical) to try a newer foreign herbal rejuvenation treatment.

                            This is what it reads to me, "when my party was in power we did nothing,  (Mani S) could not do anything either (in fact I wasn't even allowed to speak). So that went down the drain. Now, we are in opposition and even though we know that economy is heading towards disaster we'll not do/oppose anything. Basically we (Congress) will never do our job, whether in power or in opposition."

The Congress ruled India for 60 years. We saw what they did. We are still in eternal development mode. Let the new govt. do their duty. We will ask their report card in 2019. Till then, if you want - i can open a CHAI KA THAILA for you (may be you can also PM some day)

                            Transferring 10% extra money to states without any strings attached is a good thing. Let the states choose the shirt that suits them instead of center telling what size to wear. Sooner or later people will force the states to spend the money in the way they want.  Please give some time for Democracy to work. This transfer of money is not such a heinous crime, as seen in the all pervading caste system, corruption and bad governance seen during the congress regime.  I appreciate Mani's good English but I am sorry for his impractical ideas in economics.

                            You Mr Aiyar have been pandering nonsense since i know you i.e. last 40 years. Your agenda is nothing but of sycophancy and it is an intellectual pygmy in you which encourages you to write baloney with such conviction. India's GDP growth rate was at its lowest since 1991. ofcourse there was the GFC but with corruption scandals, under-valuation of state assets and their auction etc deprived the nation of billions. Infact if it was me, I would have put majority of your party fellows up for trial on Treason charges- i.e. causing losses to the exchequer. You are an pseudo-intellectual disgrace Mr Aiyyar. It is better you shine your masters shoes than give your penny worth of opinion on national issues of concern.

                            UPA frittered away 10 years of economic boom. This boom was due to lot of macro economic factors which helped India a lot. Not because of what UPA did. It came automatically. The foundations came from PV and then Vajpayee. UPA enjoyed it and were blinded by it. They opened pandoras box by getting into social schemes without arresting the crony capitalism. As a result it put in greed in minds of the people without any responsibilities. This has led to structural problems of infrastructure like road development, Surplus power, sustainable irrigation development across dry land states. It neither build for strong public education and health sector improvements

How is that only the Indian economy stood strong in 2008 when world over all other countries were going through a bad patch. Why is that the current Govt. is still funding and carrying the UPA-II scheme of course under different names. I think it's time you guys wake up and realize that you have been fooled into believing things. Here's another one...only 7 projects out of 67 are stalled due to land acquisition problems. The Govt. was trying to push the bill citing this reason. What's the result another failure in the parliament. They had to ammend the bill. One more is on it's way FDI in retail. You guys wait an watch what reasons they come up with. And somone over here mentioned the coal auction. please go back and check who was opposing it all these years. And regarding the amount. Maybe you don't understand how much that adds up to...to put it in perspective just about 3 bullet trains. That reminds me did Prabhu say good schemes of UPA :) hehehe

                            corruption and arrogance are hallmarks of congress men and they are paying the price for that.  Other problem with congis is that they cannot live without power and therefore they are really suffering.

                            Drucker once said the difference between "Doing right things" and "Doing things right". UPA did the right thing and may have to do the things right in future when it comes to power. In between BJP with hidden agenda to work for the rich and ultra rich of the country will ruin the contry and the countrymen beyond repair. Just look at the Land Ordinance Bill they are trying to push. Farmers land will be grabbed by people close to BJP in no time in the pretxet of development.

                            I was looking for the word " Panchayati Raj " in MSA's article and found it. But was greatly disappointed when I searched for the word " Rajiv Gandhi ". MSA should avoid such mistakes in future.
