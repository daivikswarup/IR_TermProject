Headline::::Salman and Sanju Excused Too Long For 'Golden Hearts'



DateTime::::2015-05-09T19:46:00+05:30




                                While Salman Khan and Sanjay Dutt may be accused in two different cases, there is a similar strand that runs through the very public trials for them.  
After a 20-year trial, Sanjay Dutt is behind bars for the procurement of arms in the 1993 serial blasts case in Mumbai. His friend and co-star, Salman, who refers to Sanjay as his elder brother, has just about managed to evade jail yet again after having been convicted after a 13-year trial. The two were last seen on screen together when co-hosting reality show Bigg Boss.
Both their cases have been debated by the media, film industry and by law experts with the same zeal. Both stars have been described as brash kids with hearts of gold who have leapt at the chance to help the poor and destitute.
Film director Anees Bazmee who has worked with Salman Khan in various films revealed to us on a news debate last night that Salman even dined with chhote log (the poor). Another friend, singer Abhijeet, has professed that these chhote log live on the streets like dogs - if one gets run over, he rationales, is it Salman's fault?
It is therefore hardly surprising that much of the coverage of Salman this week has include a focus on the choice of words used by bhai's friends to defend a man they seem to position as a messiah for the down-trodden who would never do any wrong.
No wonder the messaihs used the same chhote log as scapegoats to bail themselves out when in trouble. Remember Salman's driver who revealed to the court after thirteen years that it was not the drunk film star but him at the wheel of the SUV that ran into a group of men sleeping on the pavement, killing one and injuring four. Another chhota aadmi, Ravindra  Patil, died begging on the streets of Mumbai - he was a part of Salman's security posse and testified that the actor was driving that night. He died in 2007. His family alleges he was relegated to a social outcast.
A former top cop in an off-the-record conversation with this journalist once said that he never saw in the two stars any sign of good, rich guys who accidentally fell on the wrong side of the law. "Both have always nurtured and displayed the desire to be the bad boys, both appeared to fetishise the underworld and the bhais or dons that rule, and both did not mind being seen in the company of underworld players.  
Basically, there is a pathological problem there," concluded the cop who has been at the helm of affairs in Mumbai crime policing.
Whether Salman Khan and Sanjay Dutt are pathological criminals or not is for nobody but a court to decide, but the common defence adopted by the two bolsters the belief that Bollywood's macho men lack the spine to take the rap for their misdoings in real life, and are happy to escape the chance to set an example to the millions of adoring fans who look to them for cues.
The list is long - Aditya Pancholi, Puru Rajkumar, Fardeen Khan (all involved in criminal cases) and their friends from the fraternity have never tried to stick their neck out to suggest us that behind their PR campaigns and crafted personas are real people who can use their voice to make a difference.
Barring a few exceptions, very few, the industry cuts a sorry figure on this front.  
It is a matter of public knowledge that Sanjay Dutt's father, Sunil Dutt, who belonged to the Congress and was respected for his principles, had to visit Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray to get the actor released from jail in 1993. The first person Dutt met right after he left his cell was Bal Thackeray. Soon after, it was suggested that leaders in the Congress chipped in by pulling favours to ensure Dutt got various breaks in his trial. The law caught up with Sanju baba only 20 years later when he was sent to jail by the Supreme Court in 2013.
Soon after, editorials were written chronicling Dutt's troubled life, his turning to drugs after he lost his mother, actor Nargis. Dutt claimed he felt the hostility of the city towards him during the Mumbai riots as he had a secular family, a practicing Muslim mother.
As I watched the proceedings of the court where Salman Khan was granted bail, his family friend and well-wisher, Zafar Sareshwala, stated that Salman was implicated in the case by the earlier UPA government to play the Hindu card - that is, to show it would take action against a Muslim icon who had broken the law. For matters of technicality, one must embarrassingly explain that neither the accused nor the victims in the case were Hindus. One must also remember it was Sareshwala who was instrumental in getting Salman to be seen with Narendra Modi at the Uttarayan festival in Gujarat last year.
And Modi is not the only politician Salman has displayed his largesse towards in the last few years. He has also performed at the Yadav family-organised Saifai Festival in Uttar Pradesh, and the man who accompanies him at all times, Baba Siddiqui, is a Congress leader.
The brutally shameless manner in which both Sanjay and Salman have used the religion card and convenient political connections to bail themselves out needs to be remembered and retold. Especially when we are constantly reminded to judge the two actors only by the merits of the case and not by their celebrity status.
And the buck should not stop at the two; a part of the blame should also be taken by us, the media, who have somewhere in the process been a part of the myth-making process. Remember those front page stories of Salman stopping at some traffic signal to help the needy, or Dutt bailing out those in need?  
When Sanjay Dutt and Salman Khan were released on bail in the past, empathetic news anchors seemed to be in awe as the stars described eating dal-chawal for lunch, or standing in queues while in jail.
Perhaps, like their fans, too many of us have accepted that with larger-than-life onscreen personas come very real character flaws that can be glossed over because after all, these are heroes who may do bad, but will lend a helping hand with cameras all around.
Except they don't. Most fool us.

                            After a shameless Salman affair and the forgotten Sanjay Dutt trail, here comes some sensible write up from the very media that blurred the boundaries of the real and the screen image of these  law breaking, good-doing actors. I like the way she brings the similarities and heart-warming acts that these men have done and ask to be bailed out/ excused of the crimes they committed...<br/><br/>
But the question remains, why shud they be given spl treatment at all....

                            Salman's bail release is an travesty of justice.The law always sides the rich and the mighty. The film industry consists of people who are brainless,opportunistic and immoral,just like characters in most of Hindi films.

                            I find this article so idiotic that it actually doesn't merit a comment. How is sending Salman or Sanjay going to jail such an achievement? The only reason their cases got so much attn is because they are celebs. What abt normal folks who get run over everyday and police refuse to file an FIR? The richer party pays a bribe and case close. Villages are worse...people get away with actual murder! What abt poor people languishing in jail for petty thefts they committed years ago. If these journalists care so much abt justice meted out, worry abt these incidents. Just making an example of a celeb once every 5 years doesn't mean zilch.

                            you are sore at salman coz he did not claim to be a moslem and perhaps also rejected you in past... he caused an accident for which he should get punishment but now likes of dont start falsely accusing him of other things coz he refuses to become part of your moslem agenda... if he would have answered in court moslem when not fit to be a  judge asked him stupid question of what is your cast then you will be writing articles here defending him playing moslem card... all you sick-ulars are sore at him and his family coz they are true face of secular india ...

Salman is all body no brain, he at some point of life will definitly go to jail..i have no doubt on that..hes just pushing it a lil further. This guy thinks we all are stupid like his fans! to believe that he telling the truth...<br/><br/>
he's doing gr8 charity..but if all people were to get away with their crime by doing charity..the rich will get a free hand! Let me hit n run today i got 5 crores spare in my A/C!!<br/><br/>

                            Salman Khan's case cannot be compared with others. He did nothing wrong.<br/>
Actually when starting off from Rain bar, Salman being the large hearted human that he is, insisted to drive as he realised his companions were too sleepy as it was quite late at night.<br/><br/>
While driving, his companions in the car advised: "bhai, gaadi seedha chalaao"<br/>
Being the obedient human being that he was,<br/>
Salman bhai gaadi seedha chalaaya, seedha chalaaya, bakery junction aa gaya, fir bhi seedha chalaaya...<br/>
He did nothing wrong...<br/><br/>
Later when he stumbled out of the car which had mysteriously stopped, he saw people sleeping on the pavement,although some were lying close to what looked like muddy rain water, being the good human being that he was, he thought better not to disturb people sleeping.<br/>
He did nothing...

                            Kudos,for your daring write up, Rana Ayyub. I have not come across such a balance opinion expressed by any journalist. Promoting Salman with his 'Heart of Gold' comments is utter sycophancy on the part of the media men involved.The mention of his 42 crore charity also appears to be hugely inflated. Had he actually gone to the victims at the time, directly or through his people, admitted to his crime and offered to do whatever required to mitigate their sufferings would have touched more hearts and proved his sincerity in starting the charities. If he can prove he spent 42 crores from his money for the charity, I am willing to take his time in prison to the fullest term. As for the Bollywood hypocrites I will only say they are stinking rich, sans ethics and morality.

                            I have nothing against the court verdict &amp; the bail granted. But a question for the so called celebrities who are twitting about the "golden heart"; "the most gentle human being" Salman Khan. Would you have described him in the same fashion if a drunk Salman Khan ran over his huge vehicle over the heart of your brother and father &amp; ran away from the scene while your father or brother helplessly lay under the vehicle profusely bleeding &amp; can die any moment? We all know your answer to this question Bollywood people; don't we?

Thanks to social media and fearless media, the Indian citizen of 2015 is much more enlightened and cannot be easily hoodwinked now or in the future by VVIP figure from Bollywood world and the political class.

                            Shameful watching Salman Khan waiving to the crowds as though he has returned victorious from something. He is a convict and has been given bail - nothing to celebrate. Our judiciary and police should be ashamed of themselves. 13 years to get a conviction. And then what, immediate bail?? So the lower court's decision means nothing?

                            I live outside of India and the most embarrassing thing about this entire cascade is that this news has been published in my local newspaper, national newspaper and almost every foreign newspaper in the world. What Salman Khan and the rest of Bollywood has done has shamed India for a very long time. This type of injustice can only happen in India, where the rich and famous are treated above everyone else. It makes me sad and angry to know that these so called influential people do not care for the common man, a common man who has made these people rich and famous. To those Bollywood stars that showed support for Salman Khan, I just want to say that you have lost a lot of respect in the eyes of those outside of India. You have showed that you have done no less than Salman. He accidentally killed a common man - but you? You have purposefully killed the spirit of the common man.

                            Isn't this the same Salman who assaulted Aishwarya?  Isn't this the same Salman who threatened Vivek Oberoi?  Oberoi is no shrinking violet as far as arrogant behaviour is concerned but he is certainly not involved in crime as far as I know.  Sanjay Dutt obviously fancied himself as an underworld don but was being used all the time by the real underworld.  However, Sanjay was too thick to understand all that.  Salman, on the other hand is a willing member of the underworld but would have us all believe that he is just a nice guy who has had one or two personal issues.  Such is Bollywood life!

                            With due respect to the court and judicial system, I believe the punishment given is also to ensure the person becomes a good person. I believe with being human he is doing a lot to the community. It is not about Bollywood, I believe the best could be by ensuring him to give more than enough compensation to the victims. I know NO life can be compensated but by giving him punishment either will not help the victims and his family. We all are focussing on Salman but done see what is going on with the victim. If compensated well, they will at least be able to lead a good life

                            Salman has been dragged thru the mud and has been in the media scrutiny since the beginning. At least there was a case filed and the case went on for so many years. <br/><br/>
Exactly similar incident took place in Peddar Road in 2013 ? <br/>
Why is there a media blackout on that issue ? The same issues discussed here (Law is not equal, Celebrities get away easily etc) apply there too ? <br/>
Don't they ? <br/>
Where is "Journalistic integrity" in that issue ?<br/><br/>
Is Salman a soft target ?

Your article,big head, blabber mouth are utmost nauseating.. What investigation did you do in All IAS &amp; IPS officers murder cases like DK.Ravi,narendra Kumar Singh, satyendra dubey, harassment of M. Vijaykumar . But no you want to write only on those topics which will gain u publicity.. Now u r writing a book on Modi. U idiot write book on Netaji if u want .. U moron why do you want what salman does to his girlfriend , he loved her whole heartedlywill u go to each n every married ppl home? That's his personal life why u care and scruti it so much.. Who gave u idiot moral authority. He of course he did commit accident as alcohol diminishes judgemental power .. Hundreds of drunk n driving happens go to court wer crimes re much more severe but u stupid lady want to write only on salman.. Go and do some investigation until you reach solution.. Wer were you rest of the time u

                            i understand there are salman fans and even from those there are some who probably would place justice over their love for the actor. As citizen we should all boycott salman and all those who have supported and posted nasty comments such as 'DOGS" etc.. and had shown irrational behavior towards the victims. If film fraternity can unite then we citizen should also unite and boycott this will hurt them more financially.

Very biased article that loses the appeal because its so anti bollywood that it moves away from the actual issue of ALL rich an powerful people behaving the same way in all cases. Its a generic issue and not fixated in bollywood only. but because bollywood becomes soft target everyone in media is not leaving any chance to get any kind of mileage out of this.<br/><br/>

                            Salman Khan is a star Icon who has millions of followers , for this reason alone he should be punished by the court since he is found guilty.<br/><br/>
You do not want the common man to feel that they have 20 years to be acquitted and still not be able to get behind bars after that. If that's the case everyone in India will start murdering someone now.<br/><br/>
It's Salman's brand power , the way we purchase things when we see him on ads, the same reason he get's paid in crores for. This is something similar and if Salman get's off the hook easily by the court , then may God help this country.

                            India's judicial system is time &amp; money wasting exercise and lazy. This sytstem serves no purpose of justice system but deferring and delaying justice in the name of justice. Look at three tier system first layer is district courts, second High Courts, third Supremne Court, then 3 bench then 5 bench then 7 bench courts of appeals. This system does not have quality check on judgements delivered or appointment of judges or review of judges performances. There is no reward and pubnishment in police department for god work and bad work therefore entire judiciary and law enforcement system become rituals.

                            Both Sanjay and Salman have committed crime, drunk driving is also a crime and not excusable even though its an accident. Fact is he has taken a life not one who got crushed under the wheels but also of the police constable who was pressurized by the department and others to change his statement and was made to suffer and he passed away. Is this what Salman call Being Human. Being Human charity stated very strategically which will down the line help cover his case as being a good human being, which he is not. Look back on tape recording of his phone calls which has did surfaced and was buried under the files, his conversation with underworld dons. Now is he a good citizen.

Bad because he has no other option but to be so in this nepotistic, corrupt  and repressive  society ---but one which is actually good underneath it all. The badness is a means to an end - to allow goodness to shine. Add to this a decent helping of biceps and looks - voila - the nation is hooked. Then everything is forgiven.
