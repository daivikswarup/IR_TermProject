Headline::::Critique Smriti Irani, But Lose the Sexism



DateTime::::2015-04-18T19:41:00+05:30




                                (Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer. She is working on a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi which will be published in 2015.)
About a week ago, I received a text on my phone from a Delhi-based BJP MP which made me extremely uncomfortable. Propriety demands that the MP not be named, but I think I can take the liberty of sharing his text which said "Our Bhabhiji looks to be in trouble, saviour will have a tough time saving her on return." Bhabhiji refers to Smriti Irani in the most sexist and derogatory way.
I have been a critic of Smriti Irani myself, and wrote a column on this very platform asking her to act like a youth leader and not cater to regressive policies as an HRD minister. Having said that, the recent statements made against Smriti, whether in columns, news articles, on Twitter and other social media, as also the disclosure of snide off-the-record conversations, have compelled me to write this piece. Why is Smriti Irani being judged for being an ex-actress, for being a woman sporting a bindi and sarees, for complaining about a changing room in Goa? Why are politicians and journalists talking of her elevation to the top job only by virtue of seemingly being close to men in power?  
Smriti has won her election, is the youngest Education Minister, has picked tough battles. Slam her for her policies if you disagree with them, if you want a fair battle.
 
As a female political reporter who has been subject to some of the most sexist comments, I am outraged that a woman whose commitment to her party has been unquestionable is being subject to the most distressful misogynist attack amid the controversy over a group of parliamentarians who have written to the President about Smriti Irani, accusing her of damaging IITs and other educational institutions at the behest of the Sangh Parivaar.
 
Yes, Irani has erred in the past, whether over the statement about having a degree from Yale, or cowing to RSS diktats vis-a-vis the syllabus for schools. But frame the complaints against her in legitimate debate over her work, not her gender. There is a long list of ministers from the present government who have made extremely distasteful comments and take their orders from Nagpur. Why is it that neither what their wear nor their earlier professional qualifications are dissected with the same voyeuristic pleasure?
Why is it that we need to know that Smriti Irani was good friends with BJP powerhouse Pramod Mahajan in a recent magazine cover story on her, or is presently in the good books of Narendra Modi? What does that suggest about our own thought process? Why is the assumption that the men have allowed her political growth? Why is it that on assuming charge as HRD minister, pictures of her swim suit round at the Miss India pageant in 1998 were displayed by some news channels? Did we do the same for our male MPs from the film industry when they assumed charge?
To be a minister from a party like the BJP which receives its ideological support from the RSS, whose stand on women is not exactly progressive, one can only understand the pressure that Irani is under, given her previous profession. I remember meeting a very senior RSS leader at a cafe in Khan Market in June and asking why were certain leaders being given such hefty designations, to which the immediate retort was, "I don't know which leaders are you talking about, but as far as Smriti Irani is concerned, she was handpicked by the PM. Go ask him."
Last week, when Smriti complained about peeping toms at Fabindia, a political columnist wrote why she was shopping at the Fabindia in Goa and not Delhi. Another female leader suggested that she could smell a rat in this accusation. Really? Is that how low we have decided to stoop?
 
This and many such statements, not just from her own colleagues in the BJP but also across the party spectrum, has unnerved me.
 
And for those who call her a woman who has had it 'easy' in the party, let me share an anecdote.
At the party's important Goa conclave in June 2013, I was one of the few journalists who had been given event access inside the hotel, and was watching the flurry of activity with two other senior news editors. While most leaders were busy texting journalists about the proceedings inside, there was Smriti Irani who decided to be low profile, going about her work - from speaking to the pandal walas to the local Goa BJP leaders, ensuring that there was no bad blood at the local level and the event went smoothly. The easier thing for her would have been on TV all day or have off-record chats with leaders and journalists. I am pretty sure that there are many other leaders in the BJP who do similar work, but this characteristic has yet to be mentioned in the context of the diatribe against her.
As a journalist who has reported extensively from Maharshtra and Gujarat, I can vouch for Smriti's dedication to politics and to her party.
I don't expect there to be a course correction in this discourse on her beset with misogyny. But I suppose there is some satisfaction - however slight - in remembering that despite the most sexist attacks on the personal lives of Sonia Gandhi, Mayawati, Jayalalithaa, Mamata Banerjee, these women continue to remain formidable and influential public figures, shaping their parties every day.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            It is impossible that a ruling party MP will send a text to a journo who is clearly no firend of BJP, such a text, which is sure to get him in his party nd with the PM. The 'award winning' (for spreading canards in the most imaginative ways possible?) journo is trying hard to create faction-fights in the ruling pary. Fail. Try harder. And as for women's liberty in BJP, she should search the same nearer home in Owaisi's MIM, and then comment on the rest.

                            RSS stand on women is not progressive ? Who told you this ? The speaker herself is a women, Beti padhao beti bachao andolan was supported by RSS and you say the stand is regressive.  Ms Rana, for once atleast think neutral , dont get polarised, fooling readers is not an oath journalists take, atleast do justice to your profession.

2. Smriti did not win 'her' election though she gave a 'scare' to Rahul Gandhi. <br/>
3. We do deserve a 'better person' at the helm at HRD.

                            Smriti Irani did not win any elections.  She displays mighty unpleasant combative attitude, absolutely lacks grace, and puts people off with her arrogance.  That has got nothing to do with her gender.  Such people, men or women, invariably do.  She lied on affidavits.  Those are legal documents and yet she still continues shamelessly to be in a top position.  She holds that position because someone supports her blindly and not because she is meritorious.  Undeserving people should not be prepared to take the heat.  After all, she is enjoying the perks when she is undeserving of them.

                            A correction for Ms Ayub. Smriti Irani did not win her election. She lost in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. This correction should be added to her opinion piece.

                            If you don't agree with left liberal views you don't exist for these pseudo intellectuals. What a patronising attitude by Rana Ayyub. The whole article though tries to belittle the right wing ideology of bjp/rss. Left intellectuals in our country have totally usurped the discourse in India such that anyone professing alternative thoughts are lampooned and even worse.

                            Rana Ayub lets find hole in your garbage piece which you wrote. You started it by saying some Delhi based BJP MP sent you text message. You think anyone from BJP will dare to speak with you considering your anti-BJP view. I am sure it either must be Sagarika Ghose or some work-less CONgress  worker/leader who sent you this text message.<br/>
Later you stated, "Smriti has won her election, is the youngest Education Minister". You forgot already Smriti Irani lost her election but gave tough fight to your yuvraj. Next Lok Sabha election your Yuvraj has no chance of winning against Irani.<br/>
Show us the proof about her taking RSS diktat before barking. Do you think after such a resounding victory Modi gonna listen to RSS. Because of Modi every minister in NDA government work sincerely. Modi unlike Sonia Gandhi, is not the person who will let someone to continue in his ministry for just being sycophant. <br/>
Aanad Ranganathan of Newslaundary rightly said critic her as a HRD minister by comparing her performance with other HRD minister in past. Criticizing her  just because your paid by CONgress is not right.<br/><br/>
The infighting in BJP you prestitute (in your case prostitute) wanna create in the name of Smriti Irani not gonna work since they are lead by Modi and Amit Shah. Lekhi clearly said whom she was targeting in her tweet but if you prestitute wanna twist it then its not our fault. <br/><br/>
More to come later..

                            I have never seen Smriti in ant TV or film role.  However, I have seen her being subjected to tough interviews by the very top journalists and she has always come out on top!  She is articulate, clever, at ease in both Hindi and English, and above all, patriotic.  Various BJP wallas and indeed politicians from other parties are envious of her abilities.  People will remember the comments passed by Sanjay Nirupam.  That Nirupam character will never acquire the status and abilities that Smriti enjoys  I do hope one day Amriti is PM; she will be there by merit rather than by entitlement.

                            What a non-issue. Maybe she did rise to power because or her close relationship with powerful men but other men have also risen to power because of 'friends in high places' and been openly accused of it to. Point being this is not a case of she is being picked on because she is a woman it is because she has this perception perhaps of being arrogant.

                            Looks like a piece written to glorify an incompetent minister. Regardless of what this author claims, Smriti Irani has never won an election and given the way she is going it is unlikely she ever will. I get a feeling this author has taken it upon herself to defend the thoroughly hopeless and bungling minster(Yale degree!!) just because she's a woman.. Whatever happened to unbiased journalism.

                            "Smriti has won her election,..." For an "award-winning investigative journalist and political writer" you sure got your facts wrong. Ms.Irani has NEVER won an election. She is a member of the Rajya Sabha.

                            I rarely agree with Ms Rana's views, but here's one I fully agree with. Women of any party don't have it easy, and Smriti Irani is no exception. A well written article and timely. And i read the comments here and see how many are not about the topic but about Ms Rana herself! These are the same who will shout themselves hoarse that they are not sexist.

                            Smriti Irani is a hard working and courageous very articulate leader As to the four MPs writing to President for the autonomy of IIT is ludicrous. IITs best left alone by likes of KCTyagi et el .They should more worry about jungle raj in bihar.IITs are now half a century old institutions but worst political interference was during emergency when a famous professor was arrested in IIT Kanpur.

                            Rana, i do think you are trying to hit a lot of issues and missing a lot of them.<br/>
surely you cant just state that Irani has erred on her degree from Yale ?<br/>
Also she didnt win her election !!<br/>
And there is quite a few more but it would be a waste of time telling you what you know is the truth and I am sure from the comments already made, the readers wouldnt like to be taken for a ride !!
