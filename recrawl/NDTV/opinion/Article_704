Headline::::Why He's Narendra Atal Bihari Modi



DateTime::::2015-07-13T15:20:00+05:30




                                The road to peace between any two nations locked in a longstanding dispute is always bumpy. Yet, no road is perhaps bumpier than the one connecting India and Pakistan. The two South Asian siblings have so much in common, and yet are unable to overcome the bitter and bloody legacy of the Partition in 1947 and the problems subsequently created.
For peacemakers on both sides of the border, their efforts have seemed Sisyphean, doomed to be forever futile. Like the ancient Greek king whose punishment for his misdeeds condemned him to endlessly roll a heavy stone up a mountain, they too have found that the nearer they reach the summit of their efforts, the more predictably the stone trundles down, requiring them to start their mission all over again.
How many summit meetings have taken place, beginning with the Nehru-Liaquat Pact in 1950? How many official bilateral meetings and unofficial Track 1.5 and Track 2 parleys have been conducted? How many nicely-worded agreements, joint statements and peace declarations have been issued? The number is difficult to count. However, genuine peacemakers do not give up. For, if they do, they are not peacemakers at all. 
Perhaps learning this important lesson of history, prime ministers Narendra Modi and Nawaz Sharif, at their bilateral meeting in Ufa, Russia, on July 10, have together exclaimed: "Dum Laga ke Haisha!" A highly unsatisfactory translation of this colourful colloquial, widely understood in both India and Pakistan, would be: Give it all your energy, one more time. 
The two had shown a highly-promising personal chemistry when Modi, in a globally-lauded gesture, invited Sharif (along with other heads of state or government from SAARC countries) to attend his swearing-in ceremony in New Delhi on May 26 last year. Yet, in just three months, the stone of peace diplomacy rolled disappointingly down again when India suddenly called off secretary-level talks because of some Hurriyat leaders' meeting with Pakistan's high commissioner, Abdul Basit, in New Delhi. It was an ill-conceived and knee-jerk decision that put a big question mark on the future of Indo-Pak dialogue.
Both Modi and Sharif deserve credit for breaking the deadlock in Ufa, when they met on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. It was not a perfunctory photo-op meeting, meant just to have a face-saving handshake like the one at the SAARC summit in Kathmandu in November last year. Surprising one and all, the Prime Ministers not only talked well beyond the pre-announced time but also produced a weighty joint statement. They "condemned terrorism in all its forms and agreed to cooperate with each other to eliminate this menace from South Asia." Cynics might ask: What's new in this? 
This is what's new. Condemnation of terrorism in all its forms means Pakistan has addressed a key Indian concern - Islamabad cannot distinguish between "bad terrorists" who target the Pakistani state and its people, and "good terrorists" who spare Pakistan but target India. This commitment is further reinforced by the declaration about the two governments' willingness to eliminate, through mutual cooperation, the menace of terrorism from "South Asia" as a whole.
This latter formulation has major implications. It means that Pakistan, which unfortunately allowed itself to become an epicentre of global terrorism and Islamist extremism, stands committed to the fight against terrorism emanating from its soil and directed at India. This commitment was of course the highlight of the joint statement issued after the meeting between Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf, when the two had a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the SAARC summit in Islamabad in 2004. However, the Modi-Sharif agreement goes two crucial steps further. Firstly, the reference to "South Asia" means Pakistan has also indirectly agreed to help stop terrorism in Afghanistan, a member of SAARC. Islamabad is currently hosting peace talks between ISI-supported Taliban, who often operate out of Pakistan, and officials of the Afghan government.
Secondly, the agreement explicitly mentions Pakistan's commitment to cooperate in expediting the trial in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks case. This is surely a reassuring new development. Also, implicit in the agreement about mutual cooperation to fight terrorism is the recognition that terrorism, in all its forms, is a common threat to both India and Pakistan. We in India have so far been hesitant and reluctant to accept that Pakistan too is a victim of terrorism, even though we readily - and rightly - blame it for perpetrating terrorism aimed at us. On their part, Pakistan's rulers were earlier unwilling to acknowledge that the menace of Islamist terrorism they had engendered was bleeding their own country. However, this is slowly changing. In December 2014, Pakistan's Chief of the Army Staff, Gen Raheel Sharif, candidly stated that his country's current enemy "lives within us and looks like us". After all, nearly 50,000 people, mostly Pakistani Muslims, have been killed in terrorist attacks inside Pakistan in the past 12 years. 
The Modi-Sharif agreement casts two responsibilities on India, too. The Indian government cannot turn a blind eye to acts of terrorism suspected to have been perpetrated by some Muslim-hating Hindutva extremists. Secondly, even though Kashmir, an emotive issue with Pakistan, is not mentioned in the agreement, the reference to it is clear when the two leaders have expressed their willingness "to discuss all outstanding issues". Therefore, the Modi government will have to soon make its views known on how it wants to address the issue of Kashmir vis-a-vis Pakistan. Contrary to what many BJP supporters think, India cannot plausibly maintain that Kashmir is only an internal issue, and that it does not concern Pakistan. As per the Shimla Agreement of 1972, the final settlement on Kashmir is yet to take place, albeit within a bilateral Indo-Pak framework. 
One thing is certain. By resuming the stalled dialogue process with Pakistan, Modi has pleasantly surprised his critics, and unpleasantly surprised those of his jingoistic admirers who believe that the only to deal with Pakistan is "to teach them a lesson". With this sensible decision, one can hope he will have far more substantive bilateral talks when he visits Pakistan next year to attend the SAARC summit.
This deliberate choice of moderation on the part of Modi in dealing with Pakistan places him in the league of other sincere and passionate peacemakers in India - Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani, Dr Manmohan Singh. True, they did not succeed in their endeavours. Indeed, Advani had to pay a heavy price because of his peacemaking efforts when he, as president of the BJP, went to Pakistan in 2005. Dr Singh had made much headway in his parleys with Pakistani leaders, especially on the contentious issue of Kashmir. Unfortunately for him, the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai derailed this important project.
The most determined peacemaking effort was made by Vajpayee. Even before he completed his first year in office, he undertook his courageous bus yatra to Lahore in February 1999. And notwithstanding Pakistan's betrayal in Kargil, he invited Musharraf to summit talks in Agra in July 2001. The talks failed, but he persisted in his efforts to normalise relations with Pakistan - guided by his belief that India and Pakistan must learn to live in peace because, as he famously said, "We can change history, but not geography". A historic outcome of his endeavour was the Vajpayee-Musharraf joint statement in 2004.
Modi seems to be following Vajpayee's footsteps. On normalising the internal situation in Jammu & Kashmir, he has reiterated the first BJP prime minister's wise policy of promoting "Insaaniyat (humanism), Kashmiriyat (syncretic Hindu-Muslim ethos of Kashmir) and Jamhooriyat (democracy)". His green signal to the innovative experiment of a BJP-PDP government in J&K has helped strengthen democracy in the state.
Similarly, Narendra Atal Bihari Modi should be bold and innovative in pursuit of a principled breakthrough in India-Pakistan relations. Unlike his predecessors, he has the requisite parliamentary mandate to pursue this noble goal. (The writer was an aide to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

                            Sensible article outlining the efforts from both sides to establish and maintain peace. It is high time for leaders of both countries to raise above petty politics and recognize the strengths and needs of each side, and establish working relationship between the two Countries so both can succeed. Hope our leaders do not get distracted by all the noise and incidents perpetrated by the hate mongers and march towards bringing long lasting peace to both our Countries.

                            The blunt truth is that both India and Pakistan have gone too far down the road to ever reconcile. OK, Sharif will eschew terrorism. What about the rest of Pakistan? How much power does Sharif wield? He cannot control terrorism within Pakistan, so it is a meaningless statement by an impotent PM. Pakistan cannot be called a sovereign nation. It is a pathetic failed state. And dangerously unstable. Pakistan will give up its claim to Kashmir only when it is dismembered, so that there is no Pakistan left. Remember what Ajit Duval said about hiving off Baluchistan? That is the stark reality. So talks can go on till we are able to further bifurcate Pakistan till it is no longer a threat to its neighbours. There is no other solution to the mess.

                            Sudheendra G has concluded just to early. Modi is neither Vajpayee nor the opportunist Advani who claimed Jinnah was the most "secular" person. (I am sure it was Sudheendra who advised Advani to make this baffling statement). From then onwards it was all downhill for Advani.<br/>
Wait Sudheendra, you and your "peacenick tribe" will be befooled by Modi once again.

                            @Anonymous: If you want anyone to take your comments seriously, have a name first. Secondly, it is sad Indian media has not moved on from headlines and no wonder he does not engage with Indian media that much who pick and choose one or two words in the whole interview and the headline kills the content of the whole transaction. Media is not interested in country's or citizens good but are just interested in their ratings. Media should dig out the facts and present them for people to draw their conclusions rather than running media trials which are unfortunately highly motivated and biased.

                            Before we rename Modi  Narendra Atal Bihari Modi, we have to recognize a key change in the dynamics, which neither Modi nor Sharif can claim credit for. This is the inclusion of China in the equation. Suddenly, a hitherto strategic partnership between China and Pakistan has undergone a significant change. Whilst China will continue to supply arms to Pakistan and support them, this is no longer unconditional. India, through its economic clout and through BRICS has been able to slowly influnce a change in the strategic partnership between China and pakistan. China did exactly that by supporting Pakistan at the UN wrt Lakhvi resolution but agreed with India to push Pakistan to agree to steps to deal with terrorism. This created the opportunity for the Lakhvi voice samples. India is an investor in the Infrastructure Bank and BRICS bank, both Institutions will make a huge difference to China. Add to this, China is facing the heat with the Uighurs, who are supported by elements in pakistan. Therefore a careful play of hands, China could do more for Indopak relations than the US was ever able to.

                            If media keeps away themselves from Indo - Pak  dialogues for two years, some progress can be made. <br/><br/>
But till media is taking so much interest in it and there news add fuel in burning relationship of two nations.<br/><br/>
What media does - Questions why talk now &amp; why not earlier? During discussion, media would highlight only cross firings on borders, terrorist and  Questions government's motive.<br/><br/>
Media would ask reactions from Silly brainless politicians from both countries, and comments from Sakshi Maharaj &amp; sadhvi prachi &amp; yogi adityanath &amp; azam khan - and telecast it 24 * 7 - which would again spoil the atmosphere of talks.<br/><br/>
so if media is really  interested in progress in talk, keeps away from this news for next two years. One would find progress there.

                            I may be sounding absurd, but the picture of partition and animosity has been kept alive by the politicians, movies and media of both sides. Many of us get fun out of it too. So even if there is any possibility of solution, our mindset and thought process won't allow it to happen. We need to understand that Pakistan is not our key enemy or challenge. There are other much bigger cross border issues to handle. So may be in future, some tough calls need to be taken to end the hostility. If East and West Germany can come together, we can resolve this too.

                            In my view, Pakistan and India hitherto have used the US as an arbiter to deal with issues between the two countries and achieved little. Enter China and we now have some interesting dynamics at play.<br/><br/>
China operates from a position of strength and is very pragmatic in its approach. I am sure the meeting between Xi and Modi set the tone for the Modi and Sharif meeting. India would have said" we are doing our part to support China's infrastructure sector through investments in BRICS and Asia Infrastructure Banks. We wonder why China vetoed our resolution on Zakhvi when China says it is itself fighting terrorism in Xianjiang?" Xi would have said " we will push Pakistan, if you provide voice samples". Xi would then have said to Sharif" We have strategic and business interests with Pakistan. CPEC etc will continue to be our focus and we will invest in Pakistan. But, you have to deal with Lakhvi because India has a legitimate grievance about the lack of justice on the Mumbai attack. If you drag your feet, we will not veto at the UN and Pakistan will be in worse situation"<br/><br/>
Therefore, pragmatic politics from players in the region, who have common interests and also skin in the game is likely to produce results that have not been possible so far. On Kashmir too, if India agrees to share in the development of CPEC in return for use of the highway, Kashmir issue will move from a political to a business arrangement and hence territory becomes less of an issue.
