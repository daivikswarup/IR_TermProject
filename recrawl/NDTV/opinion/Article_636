Headline::::Why We the Consumers Must Back Jaitley's GST



DateTime::::2015-05-30T04:52:00+05:30




                                First, a quick history. Back in 2006, the people of India were informed about the Government's intention to introduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Eventually, it was decided that India would adopt the Dual GST Model where the tax would have two components - a Central GST (CGST) and a State GST (SGST) to be levied and collected, concurrently, by the Centre and the States respectively. Since the existing provisions of the Constitution do not authorize such joint levy by the Centre and the States, it became necessary to amend the Constitution. But from its  very conception, endless negotiations between the Centre and the States continued on different aspects, and the 115th Constitution Amendment Bill introduced by the UPA Government in April 2011 remained only in paper.
 
Negotiations resumed after the NDA government took over. But the states continued to demand the following: the exclusion of petroleum and petroleum products, alcohol and entry tax from the ambit of GST; fiscal autonomy via the power to vary the State GST rate within a narrow band; and a constitutional provision for compensation to the states for the loss of revenue they would incur after the introduction of GST.
 
As an agreement looked elusive, the Union Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley broke the stalemate by making certain compromises and delivered the present 122nd Amendment Bill. He also fixed April, 2016 as the target date for the implementation of GST. After being cleared by the Lok Sabha, the Bill has been referred to a Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha.
 
Now, a few words about the Bill. It proposes to empower both the Parliament and the State Legislatures to levy and collect GST. The Bill provides for certain existing Central and State indirect taxes to be combined into one tax i.e. GST. The taxes to be thus subsumed would include Central Excise Duty, Service Tax, State VAT and a host of other State taxes like Entry Tax, Luxury Tax etc. Being a destination-based tax, the Bill requires that the State's share of SGST accrues to the destination state when the goods move from one state to another. The Bill also provides for the creation of a GST Council comprising State Finance Ministers that would be chaired by the Union Finance Minister. It has been proposed that the GST Council will be making recommendations to Parliament and State Legislatures on issues that will include GST Laws, GST rates and resolution of disputes between Centre and the States.
 
Next, the issues in dispute. The Finance Minister has sorted out the issue relating to inclusion of Petroleum in a smart way. He defined GST in the bill as "any tax on supply of goods or services or both except taxes on supply of alcoholic liquor for human consumption." So, Jaitley has excluded Alcohol from the ambit of GST, constitutionally, but not Petroleum & Petroleum Products, and Entry Tax. However, in order to please the States, he left it to the GST Council to decide on the date from which the GST rate would be applicable on Petroleum and Petroleum Products. Thus, effectively Petroleum and its products will remain outside GST. The GST would provide a continuous chain of input tax credit from the production end to the consumption end. Tax paid at each point of supply of the goods will be set off by the credit given at the next stage, thus eliminating the cascading of taxes. Therefore, the exclusion of these items will not only erode the tax base, but will also knock them out of the GST credit chain. Constitutionally, Jaitley has kept Petroleum within GST, and therefore no further amendment of the Constitution will be needed to bring it within the purview of GST in future.  Alcohol and tobacco are internationally known as 'demerit goods' or 'sin goods'. Tobacco and Cigarettes will remain within GST, and in order to maintain the present level of taxes, additional excise duty and State VAT will be levied on Tobacco items. Alcohol should also be brought within the GST, and given similar treatment.
 
Now, let's come to the sore point for trade and industry. Some predominantly'manufacturing' or origin states were resentful that in the GST regime, they would be losing the states' share of GST to the 'consumption' or destination States with the  interstate movement of goods. Therefore, to please them, the Bill has proposed the imposition of an additional one percent tax on all interstate movement of goods and services. This tax will be collected and kept by the manufacturing or origin States. This is against a basic principle of GST: that a state's share of GST should accrue to the destination States. Under the current Bill, the input tax credit of one percent will not be available, and therefore, with each interstate movement, there will be a cascading of taxes leading to inflation. Moreover, at each State border there will be inevitable compliance costs- both visible and invisible. Thus,the Bill will undermine the growth of a common economic market, one of the GST's major objectives. This compensating of the manufacturing states is especially unnecessary since in any case the Bill envisages compensation by the Centre for the States in case of revenue loss.
 
Just about ten months are left for the implementation of GST. The GST Net, the IT hub that will provide a common portal for taxpayers and taxmen to interact will have to be operationalised well before April 2016. Further, before embarking upon a reform of this magnitude, the Government must release all important draft documents relating to GST laws, rules and procedures in the public domain, and get feedback from all stakeholders. They would know best where the shoe pinches. The government will have to inspire the taxpayers and earn their trust to make the GST reform successful.
 
There is criticism today that the proposed model of GST is fractured due to the compromises. But the bitter truth is that compromises often become necessary in federal democracies, and the compulsions of democracy often lead to incremental and not 'game-changing' reforms. The Dual GST model will be like a joint venture between Centre and the '29+' States. In order to make this joint venture successful, one has to take all the States on board, with the compromises this entails.
 
How will the GST, in the proposed format, benefit us? Firstly, the prices of goods should decrease. There are two reasons for this. One is that by doing away with the multiplicity of taxes, the number of collection points, and hence the multiple points of contact between the taxpayer and taxman, will come down. This will reduce compliance cost for taxpayers - both visible and invisible. Secondly, by subsuming different taxes, the GST rate will definitely be much less than what a consumer pays today individually because of all these separate taxes. Such a reduction of cost will leave more money in the hands of the investors who would then invest more, leading to more employment and growth of GDP. Thirdly, by breaking the barriers of Entry Tax and different VAT rates of different States, the GST will ensure free interstate movement of goods and services - paving the path for a genuine common economic market for the entire country.
 
The big picture that we get from the above? That it's time to move forward with an 'imperfect GST'. One should keep in mind, in this context, that a perfect and ideal GST has never been practiced in any federal democracy.
 
However, one must thrive to see that the all powerful GST Council makes course corrections at the earliest opportunity, and gives us a better GST in the near future.Sumit Dutt Majumder is a GST and Customs Expert, Author of the book "GST in India - its travails, tribulations and challenges ahead" and former Chairman Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC).Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Very funny Mr. Majumdar. Where were you when UPA was trying and present PM and his team including Mr. Jaitly were trying their best to stop it or delay it. You did not have this love for consumers at that time.

                            When UPA was in power BJP opposed everything, be it Nuclear Deal, GST, Insurance Bill, Foreign University Bill, Etc. Now when they are in power they want other parties including Congress to support passing the Bill since the bills are in national interest. Has the national interest changed in 1 year??

If he is so knowledgeable let him write in the Rupee depreciation since Arun Jaithley been the Funanace Minsiter and Rs has gone down by 5/- a dollar

                            if the present gst bill is imperfect, why proceed...even the UPA bill was imperfect...that time bjp made ruckus and country lost atleat 2%gdp growth in last two three years...who is accountable..<br/>
congres should not allow this imperfect bill to go through and insist on bjp to get a perfect bill, which is impossible for them...bjp should realise that thre is no 100 percent perfection in any bills..the lesson is to make a beginning and rectify them as we go along....bjp then did not have such minimum common sense...let them pay the price for it..

what great they have done now...we strongly support congrewss to oppose gst bill tooth and nail and teach a lesson to bjp for life...so that bju leans to behave properly in future..when they sit in opposition they should keep economic issues above party lines...

                            I see two things that most of the readers doing. They will see who is the Author to conclude whether he or she is known supporter of certain party. the comments will be just to quote someone is wrong with statements like 'Where is Pappu's fans?' and 'where are Bhakts? AAPtards' etc. Some will argue that your party opposed everything so our party will oppose everything now. They are fine if parliament sessions go with no action because all they wanted will be revenge. In a way, this entire pattern shows the kind of responsibility that we all have on any topic. Cant we do our bit to influence a change with constructive inputs however small they may be? <br/>
I read the article and see a point. No country implemented perfect GST and the proposal by the current Govt with some compromises is still a better step than spending a few more years in analysis.

                            Actually Mr.Dutt Majumdar jumped into GST bandwagon after the end of his career in IRS, seeing that the idea will keep him in 'circulation' and 'business'. He is desperate for some lime light in old age with the support of a website owner, for whom he extended many favours. He also conferred on that web site owner some award, which is earned by his colleague IRS officers by hard work. While he was in service, he claimed that he is a Customs expert(managed to stay in customs postings most of the time) and therefore does not have anything to do with central excise or service tax. From this article it emerges that his knowledge and understanding of GST is extremely limited.

                            Today all governments are by the people but "not for the people". They want revenue hook or crook. Youth are getting trapped in real estate. They are offered tax rebate for buying or for constructing of homes. But that is a bait. <br/>
1. The buyer has to register property on whatever bank loan, in normal circumstances only market value was considered. So, more revenue from registration fees.<br/>
2. The seller has to pay 20/30% of the received price as income tax.<br/>
3. when house is rented pay income tax on rent, as the tenant demands PAN number. <br/>
4. The tenant has to pay 1.5 times his HRA as rent to get income tax rebate, so stay at higher rent house, the owner also shall pay more income tax.<br/><br/>
The chain reaction grows.....

                            All these self professed "Experts" never give a simple picture to consumer. Not even a comment about this point: What happens to only services? Does GST rate applies to all services after implementation? With talks of 23-28% GST rate, imagine having to pay Rs. 100 as the GST tax for Rs. 400 cable connection. Or every mobile call will have a quarter of every rupee going to govt in the form of GST! In Indian context, most mom-and-pop service providers will charge you 25% GST of every service, but will never pay that to Govt (as is the practice today). As for goods' price, it is convenient to say these "should" decrease, theoretically. But service rates "will" increase, practically!

                            The type of response from the general public appalls me as a indian citizen. Its not about who is better of the two devil bjp or congress but what are you as citizen getting out of it. We are already subjected to a 30% at highest level of taxes. There is RPGT and other sort of indirect taxes that is pushed down the citizens throat. But is it worth it?? For the past 25 years i saw the rich getting richer and poor poorer, the disparity increased drastically. So who is to blame?? I dont think its the political parties to blame, i would definitely blame us for not able to make good choices nd always picking the better of the devils.<br/><br/>
And a question to majority, as a tax consultant myself i know the impact of gst on the economy, for a meager 5% gst can inflate prices upto 15% due to the multiplier and cumulative effect of it, are u ready to bear the cost of it??

                            The heading of the story is misleading. It's not Jaitley's GST because the  GST talks and bill have been in the air for so long. Jaitley might have done a little tweaking. Actually UPA had slogged all these years to create the GST framework. However, the other day Jairam Ramesh had revealed that Modi was against GST.

                            Forget the history of the GST. Once it is introduced corruption on the check posts will become minimal. Automatically speed of cargo will increase. One tax across the country will even prices and increase equity. The nation is in a position where we cannot afford NOT to introduce GST. Nobody can stop an idea whose time has come. Whichever the party in power, GST is inevitable. So stop playing faltu politics and get on with it.
