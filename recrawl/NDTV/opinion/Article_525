Headline::::Modi vs the Gandhis on Land Reforms



DateTime::::2015-04-23T02:47:00+05:30




                                Defining, risk-taking moments in a government's life don't usually arrive in the first year itself. When the UPA government had to take a stand on the India-United States nuclear deal, it waited till the summer of 2008, with about 12 months left in its five-year term (2004-09) to break away from the Left. At test was the government's credibility and its ability to withstand dissent and pressure, from the opposition and even supporting parties, for a cause it believed in and which it felt was of long-term benefit.
 
For the Narendra Modi government, precisely these calculations have come to determine its repeated promulgation of the ordinance amending the Land Acquisition Act of 2013, and its approach to what promises to be a titanic parliamentary and perception battle to get the legislation through. Yet, it has arrived before the first anniversary of the government. Why has Prime Minister Modi taken this unorthodox and unconventional step in a polity marked by safety-first tendencies?
 
There are two broad reasons: of principles and philosophies, and second, of politics. Modi genuinely believes his economic lessons from Gujarat - urbanisation and the creation of urban-linked jobs and prosperity, infrastructure, and industrialisation - cannot be replicated nationally without a more sensible and workable land acquisition policy. He sees the social impact and concurrence clauses in the UPA's Land Acquisition Act of 2013 as overdone and, in their current form, rendering meaningless any meaningful attempt to build industrial corridors and modern, urban economic agglomerations.
 
There are those in the BJP who honestly feel Rahul Gandhi simply doesn't understand these details, and his opposition to the amendments that the Modi government has drafted - as well as his near glorification of agriculture - is at odds with Indian reality. For example, Gandhi argues 60 per cent of India's population is employed in agriculture and is against the Modi government's land acquisition amendments. However, half this number owns no land at all.
 
Various surveys have suggested that farmers and agricultural workers want to get out of farming and move to more remunerative jobs. In 2014, the Delhi-based Centre for Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) published a survey-based report called "State of Indian Farmers". It said 76 per cent of those employed in agriculture wanted to do something else; 61 per cent preferred an urban job.
 
Relatedly, in the same year, a National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) report found 56 per cent of small farmers - those with less than 100 square metres of farmland - earned the majority of their income in the form of wages from an external job. Agricultural income was marginal to their household expenses.
 
No doubt the issue of converting farmland to urban or industrial land is a sensitive one and liable to emotive political messaging. Modi reckons it is better to go ahead with the amendments now, rather than in say 2018, when re-election worries will be looming. True, there is no guarantee that the passage of a more flexible land acquisition law will by itself revive the manufacturing climate in India. Consumer and business confidence, the investment cycle, interest rates, tax and policy predictability: all of these also matter. Having said that, Modi cannot ignore that the Land Acquisition Act has been an obstacle.
 
There is also frustration with the serial stonewalling in the Rajya Sabha and therefore a keenness to put the opposition in its place. This was particularly felt after the 2014 winter session of Parliament, which was a washout with the government able to achieve very little. The ordinance amending the Land Acquisition Act was promulgated right after that. In a sense, it was the BJP-led government's first important economic legislation. Many of its other economic bills - Insurance, GST, even Coal - have been legacies from the past, and part of the unfinished business of the UPA years.
 
If the government can get the Land Ordinance (Amendment) Bill through - probably in a joint session of Parliament later this summer or in the autumn - it will be able to tell the opposition that it (the opposition) can go this far and no further. The Congress and the Gandhi family, which have showcased the Land Acquisition Act of 2013 as a foundational achievement of the UPA period, would then have suffered a setback. The Congress' legislative weakness, and its ability to make an impact in Parliament only when a critical mass of smaller and state parties come together and decide to prop it up would become obvious.
On the other hand, if Modi cannot get the amendments passed it will be a significant blow to his government's credibility. He realises that and is doing what he does best - preparing for a take-no-prisoners outcome.

                            Problem with AAP and Congress has been its all only rhetoric and tamasha no constructive suggestions. The time bomb of huge youth unemployment is ticking every minute in India, millions of youth want jobs. Who would give them jobs, is it RAGA, AK or fragmented pieces of agriculture lands! Only Industries and Infrastructure can give them jobs. Productivity of Indian agriculture has reached it pinnacle even if 5 persons work on it or 20 work it , It means  by employing more number of people on agriculture would not yield increase in productivity. Those who oppose land bill should read it first, understand it and then offer positive suggestions if you have any. Please do not do Tamasha and street dance as you are harming Indian economy and job prospects of Indian Youth. Modiji, please call joint session ,please get it passed and show RAGA and AK their place, in permanent opposition.

                            I think Modi is making the same mistake that Chadra Babu Naidu made. He tried to create a world class Andhra and bring IT jobs to Hyderabad. He was labeled anti-poor and was booted out. Then followed freebie politics, rampant corruption and stagnation of Hyderabad making it a hell hole with choking traffic. It eventually ended with the division of Andhra. Of course, some one had to be blamed for the misery of the people. And it turned out to be Andhra vs Telangana. And Reddy's walked away 1000 crore in his pocket. Long live Congress. Long live the poor!<br/><br/>
Ideally, Modi should have left the land bill to the states. Include land acquisition law in the concurrent list. Let the states decide what their land laws should be. If Bihar wants no industrialization sure let that be. Let the state compete with each other. In fact, almost all state chief ministers voiced their opposition to previous law. But now almost all parties would united against BJP. I don't think it's worth fighting for. Don't give Rahul Gandhi an issue to hang on to.

                            Survey says 76% want to leave agriculture &amp; 56% want urban jobs. These surveys only serve the purpose of vested interests who wants these to be twisted in their favour. Better farming, more farming facilities, ample water for irrigation are the basic needs of the country. Government should strive to create this foundation and after that should start building other structures &amp; infrastructures. BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED  ROTI &amp; NOT THE CAKE.

                            Yes, people wanted to move to more profitable jobs instead of farming .now instead of helping them govt trying to snatch their land for corporates ?if this is continued like this what will next generation eat Mr Malik?  Don't u think it is the responsibility of the govt to help agriculture so that u and me and next generation need not depend other countries for food ?

                            Mr Malik : though in your article you have unequivocally supported the land ordinance in the current form , i have two questions for you : 1. the land allocated for industeries and still lying un-utlized, are you even remotely aware of the percentage of such land. 2. why fertile land ? why cant the govt pick up barren land. is the current govt wanting to turn into a food dependent country and trying to undo the self sufficiency achieved on the food parameter.  Pls respond !

                            If we could not provide jobs to ten Millions of this country, it would be disastrous for the country. There will more suicides, bloodbath on road, more pressure on agriculture leading to crimes related to land. Moreover only 5% of farmers will be affected as land to be acquired in urban, semi urban and near highways. Therefore I request everyone to support landbill for future of our india

                            The Modi govt's decision to go with the land-bill this early into their tenure is a smart move for the long run. While this acquisition issue and farmer suicides will certainly be used as a Sanjeevani by the congress, it will not serve as a strong enough wedge issue by the time of the next elections are due. There is a lot of hysteria and misunderstanding surrounding the new land-bill and 4 years is a long enough time for the BJP to counter and correct the negative perceptions that surface. I don't think the "nuclear deal" and "land bill" can be compared. The nuclear deal was a lot less contentious than the present land-bill. Plus the negative consequences of a "nuclear meltdown" are not the sort of things that the layman can imagine with clarity. The land-bill deals with a lot more tangible and real factors which will make for a more stronger and sustained emotive response. The BJP will have to start working on their communication strategy, if they are to think of retaining the majority that they have won this time around. Hopefully, the economy and manufacturing will pick up by then and people, especially the farmer class will be able to reap some of its benifits--either by new jobs in the industry or higher yield etc. The congress has to start differentiating itself from the AAP and CPI, especially in terms of its economic policies. This "leftist" and "anti-business" line that Rahul is toeing will stop reaping dividends after a point. There is a reason why the Communist party had been withering away; the bulk of it had to do with the fact that there economic policies were not conducive for job-creation. If the congress doesn't start projecting their "centrist" credentials by election-time, they are not going to be able to make a significant comeback.

                            In Bihar, all the communal parties with different ideologies have joined hands to defeat BJP. Sickening to see such opportunists at work. In Centre, Congress as usual is stuck in time warp. They don't know what they should do. With 44 seats in a 545 seats assembly, they look like a clerk who has a perception of being the chairman of the company. And somehow BJP is unable to communicate its thought process to the people of this country. Result: we are stuck with pigs around the garden when we should have been holidaying in a hill station.

                            The opposition to land bill ammendment is not between the congress and Modi govt. as mentioned by the author here. He forgets to mention that all the political parties in india except BJP,AIADMK&amp;some others, majority of the parties are opposing this bill,which includes NDA's partner shiv sena inside the parliament. Even the mentor organization of BJP, the RSS which is also opposing this ordinance. So the government instead of seeing it in the perspective of development,should re-think twice before bringing it to act. Gujarat model not necessarily be a successful model in many ways and gujarat cannot be the yardstick for other states to follow, as each states,each districts has its own advantage and disadvantages.

                            Firstly, I have not seen any bad comment on the author of this article, probably because of his leaning towards BJP/NaMo Policies. If it was an article against the BJP/Govt policies, there would have been character assassination of the author and the Congress Party, even though Congress party &amp; its members would not have had any role in the article. Secondly, there are so many statistics put out in comments favoring land ordinance and stating that in the current form, Agriculture is not a profitable proposition and indicating that farmers should quit agriculture and move to urban areas for seeking jobs. Can they also share 1) In how many cases skilled/unskilled work force in a industry/factory is more than 30% from in &amp; around villages from where the land was acquired and industry was built. 2) What is the amount of land already acquired &amp; not being used by industrialists across the country 3) How many industries/projects were stalled due to land acquisition  problems. 4) How many acres of unfertile land is available across the country which can be easily acquired by govt. These statisticians also know that in 2013 land bill, farmer who believes that agriculture is not profitable &amp; does not want to continue farming, would pretty well give his consent to sell his land to the industrialist if some good price/rate is offered to his land by the industrialist and in any case govt does not have to intervene in such cases. It is very much clear that the amendments in the bill were hurried over thru an ordinance because of pressure faced by the Govt from the corporates/ industrialists as these crony capitalists believe that the farmer, by using consent clause, would negotiate for a high rate and so, they do not want to leave any choice to the farmer except forgo his land at a rate that would be decided by the govt which again is run by these crony capitalists. This is precisely the main reason  why the amendments like removal of consent clause, social impact assessment etc were brought in through an undemocratic way (Ordinance). The same industry never had any problem with the 2013 land bill but once they saw the opportunity that the party which is favorable/close to crony capitalists has formed the government, they immediately ensured that changes that would make easy for them to acquire land (and difficult for farmer to retain land) are brought in to the bill. So, if you people have watched those good old movies where a goon, who is paid by the villain, would threaten (put pressure) on old couple to sell their house at a paltry sum &amp; the old couple will not have any choice except to sell. The current state of ordinance is the same and the only difference is the characters and i am sure we all know who is playing the goon, the old couple &amp; the villain.

                            If 10% of the farmers shift to non-agricultural urban jobs and the agricultural land is converted for non-agricultural use, the food production will suffer substantially leaving the majority of Indians without sufficient food. India is a country of 125 crores and imagine the amount of food required to keep them out of hunger.<br/><br/>
On a lighter note, the author Malik has suddenly realised how important Rahul Gandhi is in this scenario. Sometime back he had written him off calling him a kid.

I don't know why people like Malik don't understand this very basic rule. Modi is so blinded in his quest to pay-off the industrialists and industrializing the whole India, that he is ready to do anything to get his version of the billed passed. It is a very shameful thing that instead of making the farming as our main strength, it has to fight for its own survival.

somehow, it just seems that the nation is blindly polarised about this bill, theres the pro bjp faction that believes that the passage of this ordinance will provide a shot in the arm to boost economy. Then there's the anti-bjp faction (would have used pro-congress, but as per yechuris claim it's bjp vs the rest), which believes that its a nemesis for the farmers - w/o specifying which terms in the bill are detrimental to agricultural interests.<br/><br/>
shouldn't we have a one on one debate between the two factions, moderated by a neutral legal expert, explaining the ramifications of each clause of this bill - so that rational society can make independent and objective judgements?

                            It is both sad and ludicrous that politicians are succeeding in polarising people into a farmer vs industry position. Both are needed, both are necessary. A fine balance is what is required. The fact is that successive governments have completely neglected the farming industry, and all they have done is paid lip service. What is required are bold and much needed reforms in this sector. We all know that monies meant for their welfare and uplift hardly reach them, with politicians and babus and middle men pocketing a major chunk. The irrigation scam in Maharashtra is but a small example. Likewise, our country cannot do without manufacturing, which give jobs and services and products we need for our day to day lives. Cynical views that industrialists pocket profits leaving workers high and dry only exposes people's naïveté and ignorance. Let not our leaders lead us astray by polarising us. Let us think this through.

                            I am always amused by the fact that most people don't know a single thing about the land acquisition bill. They just think its a law that empowers the industries to just take away the land of farmers, just like that, or the government is just giving away farm land to industrialists. Look at all the comments people have made here to save the farmers. So many people who can read English, cared to read this article, cared to comment and give their political view, call our PM and other leaders with all sorts of names but DID NOT CARE TO READ THE BILL? How illiterate are our people ( I mean the educated illiterates)?

है..परन्तु जो रवैया सरकार का किसानो के प्रति नज़र आता है उससे कोई बदलाव की आसा नहीं बंधती....जिस प्रकार की राजनीति हो रही है उसे देखकर एक युवा का मन दुखी होता है....मैंने भी पहली बार इस बार की लोकसभा के चुनावो में वोट दिया था पर अब ये सब देख कर हमें वोट डालने का मन नहीं करता...<br/>
सारे नेता किसी अभिनेता से कम नज़र नहीं आते ..<br/>
सरकार किसानो की मौत पर दुःख प्रकट करती है...लेकिन उनकी सुरक्षा के लिए कोई बड़ा फैसला नहीं सुनाती...सरकार का काम दुःख  प्रकट करना नहीं है ..जनता को दुखो से निकालना है<br/>
 क्योकि.... दुःख तो हमें भी बहुत है..

                            Per capita suicide stats and suicide reasons imply farmer suicide is overblown political gamesmanship by the congress party.<br/><br/>
Per wikipedia (ref  National Crime Records Bureau) In 2012 :There were 19,120 suicides in India's largest 53 cities   and India's farmer suicides totaled 13,754.<br/><br/>
If 60% of people are farmers then the per capita farmer suicide rate is much lower than for non-farmers.  <br/><br/>
Also family problems and illness were the two major reasons for suicides, together accounting for 46% of all suicides. Drug abuse / addiction (3.3%), love affairs (3.2%), bankruptcy or sudden change in economic status (2.0%), poverty (1.9%) and dowry dispute (1.6%) were the other causes of suicides.<br/><br/>
Is Rahul with Kjeriwal in tow doing blood politics ?

                            It is as simple as this:  Politicians who have aquired vast tract of land do not want it to go.  In the name of farmers, they are creating havoc for all Indians - whether they are farmers or otherwise.  Can't do much until the government has a majority in Rajya Saba too.  Second, there is a possibility that some agricultural land may be required for industries.  However much?  A few acres!?  Politicians are crying like the entire agricultural land of India will go to the industrialists.  If certain politicians does not want this bill to be passed, can there be a bill, which will PROHIBIT selling of agricultural land for non-agricularal purpose?  I guess there is some law to this effect, but I can see housing colonies come up on agricultural land.

                            Well written one. I hope people realize that those farmers who don't have land will always remain poor until they be given other opportunity and that's where the Land Bill is necessary. The standard of living in China improved only because they built industry. Yes Better farming facilities is required which India has not got despite the Green revolution or in past 60 years.  But agriculture cannot bring out all people out of poverty. That's a fact. We better except it.

They blocked many bills including the GST etc bringing up unncessary objections. They could have stopped this easily with their numbers in the upper house.<br/>
why did they not bring these amendments before the elections?<br/>

                            Just two points of thought from me.. as an Indian citizen..<br/>
I dont belong to any party or caste or group.. <br/>
Even I agree that it is a great venture to bring jobs based on Industries in India..<br/><br/>
1) Not sure how much of these acquisitions for the corporates will be misused. We know how India works. If this bill is accompanied with corruption and imagine a bit of goondaism as well... This will be a deadly thing for poor farmers &amp; common people, eventhough a few might benefit out of helping or pimping the industrialists..<br/><br/>
2) Is there any clarity on what sort of industries Govt is going to handover the lands on lease.. and what would be state of land after the lease.. thinking of environment, under ground water sources etc<br/><br/>
3) The population is growing.. next thought would be ..are we efficient enough to meet food requirements of this population? If yes, how this is achievable without enough land. The author of the article commented that a lot of farmers want to move out of agriculture.. are we thinking why?? farming not important? they want to look for other options bcoz primarily they dont get the right value for the crops.. should we address that issue or bring these people into industrialization, especially when most of them are illiterate or non-skillful for other jobs..? to me thats like in the pretext of fixing a problem you are inviting other issues..

                            I would like to see consent clause and R&amp;R clause be added to the bill. To my opinion unused land and barren land use be also included in Bill with giving not only priority but compulsory. Land laws be also stream lined as many disputes related to land are there in all courts. Even corporate agriculture be included in Bill to safe guard food security. For employment generation a nodal agency to monitor and publish datas actually employment generated. There are many land pockets with corporates lying without farming be made mandatory to do agriculture use till industrial use.

                            There are multiple statistics and not just what Ashok Malik has mentioned in the article about the contribution Agriculture makes to our national income versus the people dependent on them. Agriculture's contribution to India's national income is not more than 15% where as 50-50% of our population are dependent on it. All over the world, Developed nations have no more than 8-10% of their national income contributed by Agriculture. And all Developed countries, not more than 10% of its population is dependent on Agriculture. Even china has moved massive number of its people out of Agriculture to other productive areas. Its a myth that moving people and reducing agriculture areas will reduce food production. US with less than 5% of population on Agriculture produces more than India. Agriculture Productivity has to be improved by using modern technology and not by having more poor people doing it. <br/><br/>
Moreover, we are staring at a human tragedy here which cannot be solved by putting more money behind bad policies. The average land holding of an indian farmer is not more than 3 acres. With such small lands, no productive, profitable agriculture can be done even if you pour tons of money. And remember, UPA was mauled because they tried to appease the farmers by doling out freebies like hike in Minimum support prices, which resulted in huge increase food prices and inflation. Profitable agriculture needs land consolidation and mechanised farming that achieves economies of scale and brings down the cost of production. Whether you are in earth or mars, the laws of economics dont change. The only way forward to avert a mass of population mired in poverty with no hope to escape out is to bring them to towns and cities and provide gainful employment that gives them cash in hand which they can spend. <br/><br/>
There are few things that government can look into like creating cooperative farming where the farmers come together to pool their land and outsource to professional agriculturists on a profit sharing formula. They themselves can they get employed else where to earn more money. But what will happen to landless agri laborers. For them, we need more industrialization, for which we need land.<br/><br/>
If people can read data and think, they understand the problem Narendra Modi is trying to solve. Hoever, Rahul Gandhi and his family believes in distributing poverty to all so then they can give bakshish to people like Rs.2/Kg of Rice, wheat and MNREGA labor doles of Rs.100/day. They know that only these kind of people vote for Congress. Those who escape to Middle class will never vote for Congress.

                            All those here who are worried about agriculture output and "rotis" for the future need to ask themselves a question. Do you or your children or grand children want to be farmers and derive your primary income from farming? Do you even know how difficult it is to survive as farmers? Majority of Indian farmers own land which is very small in size. It is not economically sustainable for a family. Farms need to be consolidated to make them economically viable. That is the basic problem in India. Overpopulated and division of farms to smaller sizes over generations. I come from a village in Gujarat. No young man in a village wants to remain in the village. Most of them are college graduates or at least high school. But they are forced to remain in village because they cannot find an urban job, just like yourselves. Moreover, there is a social problem. A young man in village finds it hard to find a bride. Nobody wants to marry their daughter in a village, even though the girl lives in village. Hence the young men go to cities and do any work that they can find in order to get married. They live in squalid conditions in cities compared to villages but they still live in cities. Most villages only have old people as the young have moved on to cities or partially moved. India needs to create 1 million jobs a month i.e. 1 crore a year i.e. 10 crore in 10 years, to employ the youth. The actual figure of youth is more than twice that much. Where are these jobs going to come from. If India does not do something fast, it is going to end up in a situation of chaos and social unrest. I am not suggesting a blind takeover of farmers' land. They must compensated 4 times the actual market price. Actual black market price NOT the "sarkari" price. That way these farmers will have a decent base to start a new life in the city. During UPA regime, it was the middle men who profited from the sale of agricultural land and not the farmers in most cases. That's how twisted the whole land policy was. Most of the industrialists, big and small, actors and cricketers and the like are registered as farmers. Who use this status to buy more lucrative farm lands and also use it to evade taxes. That's how twisted the whole system is. But I also agree, the govt. should first use the barren lands for industrialization. Develop roads and other infrastructure so that barren land can be turned to industrial hubs before using the good land. People who are ranting sympathies for farmers here are out of touch with the reality. Let them spend some time in various villages in various states and then make their judgement.

                            The main reason this is being done is missed. Contrary to the popular opinion, this is not to create direct jobs but indirect jobs. The government is eyeing the use of land, not for any of the giving to industry reasons that you think. This would directly impede them being elected for the next decade if they did so and they are not fools. <br/><br/>
The main reason is to build energy sector plants, specifically nuclear reactors. The script is written, we have the support of the us for technology, the uranium negotiated with australia and canada. Only stop is nuclear plants.<br/><br/>
The biggest actor against this included Greenpeace, which has been brought to reins. The main cause for concern is for a reactor, you need it near a good water source and accessible by road (but further away from big cities). Further, reactors take a long time to complete and a 5 yr time frame is not sufficient. Good water sources are usually directly correlated with fertile land. Irrigation projects will be a side-effect of any nuclear project since they can be achieved with relative ease. This is why the govt keeps saying irrigation projects.<br/><br/>
Most barren land is not near a water source and hence the need for acquisition. The farmers will give land for irrigation but not for reactors. With no reactors we will be obliterated in the industrial front. <br/><br/>
I am not making a case for or against the government but note that the changes proposed do not allow for non-government holding of the land. On the lease, it is unsustainable since the lease amount would have to be determined by a complex array of things and if one of the farmers who owns the center part of the reactor were to withdraw his lease, what would you do ?

                            This debate about land acquisition bill is necessary with positive mindset. We can see clear shift from agriculture based economy to non-agriculture (industrial, service, knowledge etc) economy. Many farmers are committing suicides because of failed govt policies, non profitable farming, changes in the climate. It will get more and more difficult to provide support to farming in our country with very small land per family and low literacy, low awareness about new techniques. NDA is doing the right thing by providing options to farmers at village level. If other parties do not want farmers to give away an inch of land for infrastructure development, industrial development then they must come up with solutions to make farming profitable. You can not just play with the lives of farmers and youths who are looking for jobs in villages and cities.

                            In India there a lot number of people with suicidal tendencies; the villages and farmers; never get to treat the problem. The Media and the opposition parties, particularly, the Congress and AAP are inciting people  and aggravating their tendency to commit suicide.  India has always been prone to natural calamities, floods crop damages and so on have been happening all the time  and committing suicide is not a remedy to any problem.  Perhaps  the Political approach of the Parties and the Media attention is inciting the farmers; it appears that some of Political parties favour incentivising suicides for petty political mileage.  The Media and responsible political parties should immediately stop aggravating the "decease" in the poor farmers, but rather help the farmers find solace. The Media should  run  counselling programmes of a counselling nature rather than quoting and running fierce foreign made speeches by  our  handsome politicians.  The Common People of this country should have the courage to face natural calamities and  that India as a State cannot guarantee full  compensation to all of its affected farmers, we are still one of the poorest countries in the world.

                            People work on perceptions - a very counter-productive thing to do. And, perceptions keep changing. Unfortunately, ability to create perceptions is more with self-seeking opponents than with the well-meaning doers. It is because the opponents generally shed away all their sense of social responsibility. With the result, the doer starts looking like a villain, despite all his constructive abilities and good intentions and the irresponsible opponents start appearing saviours despite their well-disguised villainy.<br/><br/>
The present question has been made to look like farmers vs. industrialists, or rich vs. poor while it is not. The industrialists are the ones who create jobs for the farmers, for the poor, and for all. And, it is the worker, the employee that works to create profit for the industrialist and earn his own livelihood and prosper. Imagine if there was no industry in India today, how many of us would be so worse off and even starving. Will the poor farmer not benefit by better industrialisation, will he not benefit if he had better infrastructure in his village? Will he not benefit with better availability of agricultural implements, fertilizers, testing facilities etc.

                            Liberalization, Globalization &amp; Privatization has reduced majority of Indians to sacrifice goat for economic exploitation by rich and wealthy people through dominations of Business Houses, Celebrities kind of Gladiators, Bureaucrats, Politicians and Media nexus. Converting farmland to urban or industrial land there is no guarantee that the passage of a more flexible land acquisition law will by itself revive the manufacturing climate in India. Various surveys have suggested that farmers and agricultural workers want to get out of farming and move to more remunerative jobs are conducted by educated elite who do not have sense of agriculture income are means of sustainable growth theory in village economy. so called 76 per cent of those employed in agriculture wanted to do something else; 61 per cent preferred an urban job do not have education and skills or competencies that will offer them employment in non-farming or urban jobs. Basically these new government policies are promoting increase number of landless labor, landless farmers, and driving a particular class of society associated with business/trade/commerce into land development business on prime locations near national highways to be occupied through this mechanism of land acquisition. This is only protecting interest of business community who are operating businesses in India as community based business model with monopoly into possession of prime land at prime locations become new business commercial gimmick. This land acquisition bill amendment is fooling farmers and become foolish politicians who believe they can get rid of farmers with using forcible means and measures. Its impossible task a head for Government because they are challenging the destines of millions of farmers.

                            I agree with Land Bill, but i would like to add below provisions in it -<br/>
1. Use Barren Land first (Roads need not be straight)<br/>
2.Govt / Industry to LEASE (fix time contract) and not Buy, current owners hold the title.<br/>
3. Set some minimum market prices<br/><br/>
People who supporting blindly, keep in mind once your land or house get acquired in this manner - you will cry out more loudly.<br/><br/>
Lastly, I am ready to take this job to oversee that these things done smoothly and to everybody satisfaction. USD1 million yearly Salary will do(so NO temptation of any sort), no need of red BATTI car or housing etc. I bring my own Mobile and desktop / laptop (Indian govt to provide necessary software) I do not need any air conditioned office as i believe in field work!!

                            The increasing industrialisation of agriculture has meant higher input costs met through greater debt resulting in loss of ownership of land by small holders. When nature deals a hostile blow and revenues for the farmers are insufficient to pay their debts then tragedy unfolds. India has some of the finest agricultural land in the world. A solution would be to form co-operatives of small holders to enable them to benefit from economies of scale. It would also improve their power in the market.

                            It is alright when political party spokespersons give spins to arguments, or show one-upmanship or debate on points which really is not the point his adversary is talking about. But when respected journalists pretending to be independent do that., it makes you cringe. <br/><br/>
The debate is not whether governments should push for urbanisation/industrialisation.    That's a given now. But whether it should be done in a just and consensual way or government should just bull-doze its way without looking for social impact, consent and equity. <br/><br/>
There probably could be an argument for doing it the former way. But I would like to hear the arguments for it.
