Headline::::Why Yakub Memon Must Not Hang



DateTime::::2015-07-28T16:07:00+05:30




                                Unless something dramatic intervenes, within the next 48 hours, the State would have taken vengeance on Yakub Memon on behalf of all of us, including those 37, among whom I am privileged to be counted, who have endorsed a mercy petition addressed to the President drawn up by six of the most distinguished judges we have had in recent times - Justice Panachand Jain; Justice A. Suresh; Justice S.N. Bhargava; Justice P.B. Sawant; Justice K.P. Siva Subramaniam; and Justice K. Chandru.
The petitioners have not challenged the fact of Yakub Memon's involvement in the conspiracy that resulted in the death of 257 innocents in the bomb blasts that rocked Mumbai in March 1993. That is a given which the convicted person admitted to when he surrendered himself to the authorities after having been on the run for nearly a decade. The surrender was negotiated but voluntary. The negotiations took place outside the country and included his revealing Pakistan's role before and after the conspiracy was hatched and executed. In exchange, Yakub Memon was assured that he would not hang. Unless our mercy petition is accepted, he will.
The travesty of justice will lie in his losing his young and promising life, not because he was directly involved in taking life, but because he happens to be the brother of the main culprit, "Tiger" Memon, who is still hiding out, well away from the grasp of our investigating authorities. It is also where young Yakub Memon could have remained, had he not chosen to accept in good faith the bargain he was offered (and probably demanded) - that he retain his thin thread on life in exchange for telling all to the police and the prosecutors. 
That is but the beginning of the story. Yakub Memon's case has been determined by the highest court in the land as belonging to the "rarest of rare" cases where the death penalty has been invoked. As in the case of Afzal Guru, the charge is not that he lit the fuse of the bombs that destroyed lives, but that he had advance knowledge of what was being planned, and did not reveal it to the authorities in time to forestall the tragedy. That is a serious crime. It deserves to be punished. The question is: does it warrant taking a life in your name and mine?
While the principal criminals, those who planned and executed the dastardly acts, will probably live out their natural life, the insistent question that remains unanswered is whether Yakub is to hang for what he did, or as a surrogate for those who actually did the killing? And has he been made that surrogate because he is the blood brother of the principal accused? For after all, there are 10 others who were tried with him and found guilty but escaped Death Row although they include those actually responsible for laying the bombs. 
Is being directly involved in the killing a lesser crime than being involved in the conspiracy to kill? Yakub is an accessory before the fact. He is not the fact itself. That is what merits a deeper look into the totality of the case even after the Supreme Court has pronounced its sentence. For, to do so is provided for within our law.
Many take it for granted that since the Supreme Court has said its piece, that is the last word. Not so. Our Constitution provides under Article 72 for the President of India, in his own personal discretion, to "grant pardon and to suspend, remit or commute sentence in certain cases" as the learned Justices have argued in our mercy petition. It is also for the President to take his or her time to make such a decision. Thus, President Abdul Kalam kept all cases of the death sentence but one pending throughout the tenure of his office. He did so because of his principled view that it is barbarous to take a life for a life or however many lives. The learned Justices in our petition have pleaded, "Bloodletting and human sacrifice will not make this country a safer place; it will, however, degrade us all". 
That is the final sentence of the petition they have drafted. It is the conclusion they have reached after reviewing the Yakub Memon case from every angle. The grounds for their disagreeing with the Supreme Court sentence are several and I will attempt to sum them up.
First and foremost, they (and we) have pronounced ourselves against the death penalty per se. I protested when Afzal Guru was hung; I do not protest when it is revoked in the case of Nalini and others who have been convicted of being part of the conspiracy that killed Rajiv Gandhi; I hold on to that view in the case of Beant Singh's assassin. More than 130 countries have abolished the death penalty; we are among the few to retain it in the face of overwhelming evidence that the death penalty does not deter but does diminish us all. 
Indeed, our mercy petition bases itself on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the international Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, and the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, all of which India has ratified. True, India is still to ratify the Second Optional protocol that aims at abolishing the death penalty, but one fundamental general purpose of the petition is to urge the Government of India to do so.
While that is our point of general principle, while the moral principle is that, as Gandhiji put it, "taking an eye for an eye will only lead to leaving the whole world blind", we argue that the specifics of the Yakub Memon case also warrant a Presidential grant of mercy. 
First, say the learned justices, the mercy petition they have drawn up meets the procedural requirements laid down by the Government, and is in conformity with the Supreme Court's judgment on procedure in a 1976 case. Second, fixing a date for the execution in the death warrant, in this case within a very few days of the sentence, is "illegal" in view of the Supreme Court's decision made but a few months ago in the Shabnam case, namely, that time must be given for the accused and his lawyers to "participate and contest the issuance of a death warrant". 
Apart from these procedural issues, on substance there are five main considerations of fact and law that have been urged. The petition argues that when the Supreme Court has considered "the long period of incarceration" of the 10 co-accused as warranting a "mitigating circumstance" for commuting the death sentence awarded to them, why should a different yardstick be used for Yakub Memon? Several Supreme Court decisions have been cited to show that owing to the fact of lengthy incarceration, "the government to that extent is not bound by the conclusions arrived at by the Supreme Court" (emphasis added). Also, citing yet another 2014 case, Shatrughan Chauhan vs. Union of India, the petitioners say that as Yakub Memon has been medically found to be suffering from schizophrenia, he is "mentally unfit for execution."
But, most important of all is that the commuted co-conspirators played a much bigger role, a "much more critical and direct role in the actual execution of the bomb blasts than did Yakub Memon". Why should he be hanged while the others are not? Is it because his real crime is that he is a surrogate for a brother we are unable to lay our hands on? Moreover, if the mercy petitions of Rajiv Gandhi's killers and of Devender Pal Bhullar, Sardar Beant Singh's assassin, have been set aside on the ground of "delayed justice", should not the same apply to Yakub Memon, especially considering that the law under which Memon has been tried, the much-discredited TADA, has since been repealed?
Hence the petition that Yakub Memon be spared "the noose of death for a crime that was master-minded by someone else to communally divide the country". The President will decide. He might wish to bear in mind Portia's famous words in William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice:The quality of mercy is not strained;
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes
Our plea is for "mercy to season justice".(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mr. Iyer, this is not an election result that you have started analyzing. This is a formal process of law. What he did after doing the act is immaterial. What he did to do harm to the country is the most important thing. While it was being hatched, he was a party to it and fully understood the consequences of what would be the loss of human lives, and that he is waging a war against India. Once the act is done, he may do whatever drama he does, we must not show leniency

                            It appears that terrorists new that they have fans in India (MSA and other group) who can support and question the judgement. These so called eminent personalities never bothered for 300 lives lost during blasts. These guys never bothered for the families who lost their kit and kins in blasts, these guys never bothered for the families who lost limbs, legs, hands and someone was on coma for last 20 Years. Why our eminent personalities never cried victims? Where is the humanity of this personalities. These so called eminent personalities are failing Indians. Very sad that in India terrorists get support

                            The Supreme Court certainly needs to be clear on their terror related laws. I think there should be "Zero Tolerance" towards anyone found guilty of participation in a terror act against the nation, and that is irrespective of the level of participation. Have a straightforward approach and award death penalty to all found guilty. I think it is unfair to award terrorists a "life sentence" and not the "death penalty" in the first place. When the victims of the terror act, for no fault of their have to lose their life and their families have to cope with the trauma for the rest of their life. Then why should the terrorists life be spared in the first place? How can you have terrorists put on life sentence and live in prison and eat and sleep comfortably. India is not rolling in money, that you can keep collecting all these terrorists in prisons by having them put on life sentence and providing them free meals and shelter. <br/><br/>
To try and compare India to those countries that don't have death penalty is unrealistic. Firstly majority of those countries don't have to deal with terrorism from across their borders on a regular basis. India has been a big victim of terrorism for many years and is regularly targeted by terror organisations based out in our neighbourhood.

                            Our Government Cheated Him. <br/><br/>
I returned to clear my name, remove stigma said Yakub Memon in Tada Court on July 7, 2001<br/>
==========================================================<br/><br/>
New Delhi : The whole case of Yakub Memon depends on only one question ‘How did he come to India?  Whether he surrendered or he was arrested by the intelligence agencies?<br/><br/>
How did he arrived at New Delhi railway station and later arrested by  Indian intelligence agencies ?<br/><br/>
Now it had been authenticated that he came to India ‘to surrender and get a fair trial to clear his name'. The article of B Raman has clarified it.<br/><br/>
Today a national daily has published a report about his statement which he gave before TADA court on July 7, 2001, which further substantiates the fact that Yakub Memon  came to India to surrender before the police.<br/><br/>
"I am innocent. I have not committed offence. We are falsely implicated in his case. I am a law abiding citizen. I have been to Dubai on March 11, 1993, along with wife and family on temporary visa on original passport. Due to unavoidable circumstances we could not come back. In July 1994, I returned to India with great difficulty and risk … I was never arrested on August 5, 1994 and am shown falsely arrested by PW (prosecution witness) 474 (Harishchandra Singh, superintendent of Police, CBI, New Delhi). Since am not arrested there is no question of anything being seized from me," said Yakub Memon on his arrest .<br/><br/>
Yakub Memon has also said ‘"I am innocent. I have not committed offence. We are falsely implicated in his case. I am a law abiding citizen. I have been to Dubai on March 11, 1993, along with wife and family on temporary visa on original passport. Due to unavoidable circumstances we could not come back. In July 1994, I returned to India with great difficulty and risk … I was never arrested on August 5, 1994 and am shown falsely arrested by PW (prosecution witness) 474 (Harishchandra Singh, superintendent of Police, CBI, New Delhi). Since am not arrested there is no question of anything being seized from me,"<br/><br/>
But after his'  mysterious ‘ arrest  there was   a lot of hullabaloo in media  at that time and it was blamed that the government had made a deal with the ‘ Terrorist'.<br/><br/>
All of a sudden the government changed its stand and started dealing with Yakub Memon  as he was  trapped arrested  by Indian authorities and the whole case turned against  him.<br/><br/>
The case of Yakub Memon stood only on the fact whether he came to surrender and cooperate with the government or he was arrested.

                            If all accused for the Mumbai blasts, including Tiger Memon and Dawood Ibrahim were arrested, along with every single individual who was directly or indirectly involved, what would have been the sentences for each? Assuming all were arrested and tried before justice at the same time, I am certain that the sentences would have matched the crime committed. The highest punishment to the mastermind and those directly involved, and lesser to others who were not directly involved. I wonder what would have been the sentence given to Yakub Memon in that scenario.<br/>
Our law enforcement agencies failed to catch the main culprits. And they are showing their frustration, by piling on all sentences (or the max) to the one they caught....that too by false promises.

                            Death penalty, agreed is not a sufficient deterrent, then what is? A man who surrendered to the authorities and gave up practically all information on the blasts must be treated with a little more clemency, but I am not a judge and I leave that to their best judgement. A life sentence with working for social work like building roads and in village construction would have been a better sentence.

                            Mr.Mani, I hope you are aware that you are able to say these meaningless word because you are not the one who lost someone. Please take a moment and think of thoes families who have lost their loved ones. Just a thought,If the decision of hanging the terrorist would not be taken, wouldn't you be the one telling how the govt. is doing injustice? Is the rivalry between the parties so important that you forget your duties towards your nation? How can you support the person who tried to spifflicate our nation? How can you live the rest of your life knowing that you  supported a terrorist who lacerated our nation ; the nation who gave you the position and authority to give your opinion and suggestions that would matter and you used them against it.What good is that terrorist alive anyway? Think of the Soldiers who gave their lives just to catch that one terrorist. What justice are you doing to them and their families. In my opinion all the reasons you have stated above are not enough to grant him his life. I would like to request you to use you power wisely. Atleast be faithful to yourself and your nation.

                            What about those who don't agree with the petitioners? What about those who are near and dear ones of those innocent people who lost their lives? What about those who got seriously injured and lost means to earn livelihood for themselves and their dependents? What about those who lose their precious lives due to various types of accidents or natural calamities? When so many innocent lives are lost everyday, should we care for a person's life who brought miseries to about thousand families. I wish these petitioners loved ones were one of the victims! SUFFER and then boldly say that he killed the bread-earner of your family, brought miseries to your family, and still you have signed the petition. Hypocrites! Get Lost!

                            My genuine question to Mr. Aiyer is, if someone educated and rich commits mass murder like this, can that criminal be spared even if he strikes some deal? The court and the prosecution was right to decide the punishment of the mastermind. Court commuted the foot soldiers punishment on the ground that they were merely used by the mastermind. Then what reason is left for the masterminds like Yakub? Its unfortunate that we could not catch Tiger, so can we spare another murderer? In your entire write up there is little mention of the extent of crime committed by Yakub, which is proven in the court, still you tomtom that 'he is hanged because of his brother'!?! How can you draw parallels between Rajiv killers and Yakub? I hope you remember how many people, and what kind of people died in both of the incidents. I am not for hanging political killers like Nalini or Afzal Guru, but those who kill innocent people keeping themselves in safe distance, or those who kill innocent women after raping them, must get death penalty. I want to know if you will defend Nirbhaya's killers, there are more reasons in favour of them like they were poor etc. I too wish his life is spared, but probably in a crude country like ours death penalty is definitely a deterrent. The countries you mentioned abolished capital punishment, excercise a different level in their society level!

                            Yakub Memon was active participant in the 1993 stock exchange blast. His direct and active participation in the conspiracy has been proved beyond reasonable doubt before every forum. Hence, that remains out of question. <br/><br/>
Also, it is not refuted that Article 72 of the Constitution provides the President with power to pardon the punishment of convicts. But in my opinion, such power does not include power to review decision. Hence, another representation made by worthy MPs of this country non-justiciable.<br/><br/>
Lastly, the grounds on which another petition is being filed seems frivolous as in any case issuance of death warrant merely deciding date and time of hanging is no ground for pardoning of punishment. Assuming not admitting that such issuance of death warrant was against the tenets of law, the Apex Court can merely cancel such warrant but cannot set aside the death sentence. Hence, another death warrant can be issued.<br/><br/>
In a nutshell, Yakub Memon's capital punishment can be postponed but must/ should not be set aside.

                            Mr Mani. If the agreement by the GOI was not to hang him then, the previous government should have given it in writing to court. Isn't it too late. You are crazy

                            Its better to die than to rot in Indian jail for rest of your life, i would say he would be glad to have sentenced to death unless he is living luxurious life in prison. Imagine half of country lives under poverty line how would the jail system be.

                            So finally he has lost whatever little sense he had left in his dotage. This man should be declared a danger to society and confined under psychiatric care.

                            Mr Mani the nation doesn't need your English or grammar. He certainly deserves and he might have returned because of many other reasons including a more miserable life under ISI patronage and not really the guilt. If it was guilt, he would have done it just after the heinous crime. Please keep a tab on such unworthy opinions.
