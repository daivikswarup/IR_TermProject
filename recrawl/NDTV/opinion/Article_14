Headline::::What Trump And Modi Have In Common



DateTime::::2016-02-28T03:42:00+05:30




                                It's so unlikely you have to pinch yourself to believe it. Donald Trump, a property billionaire and reality TV star with no political experience, loud, vulgar and with a preposterous hairstyle, is well on his way to becoming the Republican party's presidential candidate.
He's storming into Super Tuesday, when 11 US states vote in primaries or similar contests, as the frontrunner, with three successive victories. In Nevada, he got more support from Republicans than his two key challengers, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, combined.
The ruder he is, the more his support base rally to his standard - the less he sounds like a conventional politician, the more he is championed as the man who will punch the Washington political establishment on the nose.
He described Mexicans as rapists and wants to build a wall across that vast southern border to keep out  illegal migrants - yet in Nevada, Latinos too plumped for him. He suggested that a woman TV anchor was tough on him because she was menstruating - but women remain the bedrock of his support.
Donald Trump is the epitome of the "anti-politics" politician, the man who offers authenticity over political artifice. That shorthand is too simple, of course. Trump is proving himself to be a very effective communicator and campaigner - far from turning his back on the political system, he is playing it better than anyone else around. And he has that key ingredient which really helps in American politics - almost boundless personal wealth.
And it's not just Trump who represents the rise of the insurgent candidate and the outsider politician. Bernie Sanders - a self-declared socialist in a political landscape where even "liberal" is a dirty word - has deeply unsettled the Democratic party power brokers. He's up against Hillary Clinton, a much more formidable opponent than Trump's rivals, and so far has held his own.
At 74, he's getting on a bit - but the young, those impatient for change, are his most fervent supporters.
A 20-year-old Sanders supporter, a woman, explained to me the other day why she isn't out there campaigning for the first woman to have a serious chance of being elected to the White House. "Hilary wants power for its own sake - she doesn't know what she wants to do with it," she said. "But Bernie, he wants power to change America."
Across the Atlantic, there's a lot of scoffing at the absurdity of American politics. But in Britain as well, the standalone outsider is making the political weather across parties.
Take the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson - superficially, his only point of similarity with Trump is a non-conventional haircut. He's from a well-connected family, educated at Eton and Oxford, and is a politician to his fingertips. But he has managed to create the aura of being an anti-machine politician, with his bloke-ish irreverence - the common man's common sense Conservative. It's a political conjuring act, but it's worked.
Johnson has now spectacularly broken ranks with his own Prime Minister and is campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union - there's a referendum being held in June.
And the Labour opposition has in 66-year-old Jeremy Corbyn a British version of Bernie Sanders - a habitual left-wing rebel who has challenged conventional wisdom by being elected party leader.
In both Britain and the US, the rise of these political outliers is in part about the long years of economic difficulty which has jolted the confidence of the middle-class and upset traditional political loyalties.
 
The aftermath of the Iraq war - and now Syria's civil war, the rise of Islamic State and the huge flow of refugees - has provoked a sense of insecurity. That encourages support for politicians who appear to have answers rather than simply restating the problem.
And where a political wave would once have taken years to build, now social media can amplify a trend, provide a virtual sense of political community, and propel new figures and movements to centrestage in a matter of weeks.
The world's biggest democracy has not been immune from this global trend towards anti-establishment politics. The spectacular rise of the Aam Admi Party is one of the most emphatic aspects of this global phenomenon of insurgent populism.
So too is the success of Narendra Modi, who presented himself as the small town outsider, at a distance from Delhi and its tarnished institutions, and used new forms of campaigning - holograms, selfies, social media - to enthuse those previously not greatly engaged with the political process.
It would be foolish to stretch the analogy between Donald Trump and Narendra Modi too far. And there is one striking difference. Unlike Trump (or indeed Sanders, Johnson, Corbyn and the other outsider political aspirants), Mr Modi isn't just campaigning for the top job - he's got it.(Andrew Whitehead, a former BBC Delhi correspondent, is an honorary professor at the University of Nottingham and at Queen Mary, University of London.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Total 18 paras in this article. The 17th one mentions first Modi and paints him as outsider from town and says selfies etc are his only methods of promotions. <br/><br/>

                            Can you name one British politician in history of Britain who has got welcome as Modi gets when he comes abroad? Andrew one thing is sure your analysis is very poor - Try concentrating only on your job at Northampton uni also your face shows you are almost nearing retirement few years to live why not die with some respect. Trump has never been elected and has no experience of governance but Modi has been elected in Gujarat for consecutive fifteen years and has performed. Also Modi has won election of India with majority. I do not know if you have any idea of winning election with majority vote in India which can be compared to size of Europe. Never thought of comparing Cameron to Trump both have similarity they mouth of and have no value in their homeland.

                            Andrew whitehead and others of his ilk are like worms coming out of the woodwork. Totally meaningless and negative. These people have an agenda to show India in a negative light over its problems, because it perpetuates the myth of western culture being superior to Indian culture. A walk in any city center in england over a weekend evening will show the degradation of british culture and how rowdyism and drunkenness takes over the city. I can write many tales about british culture and how bad it is, however, I also appreciate the positive points in british public life and choose to focus on that and avoid the negative stuff. As journalist, I would request Mr. Whitehead, to also understand the Indian point of view better rather then simply playing on stereotypes of caste discrimination in India.

                            Mr. Andrew, Mr. Modi might have used social networking for election campaign, but the similarity ends right there. They are totally different. You better consider their hair style to get a better idea, Mr.Modi has his own hair, unlike Mr. Trump. I think you should think along that line to get a better idea.

                            I think Author just used Mr. Modi's name to pull the attention (usual trend here). Otherwise, might be Mr. AK (Unconventional politician) would be a good comparison. One another difference is, unlike Mr. Trump, PM Modi was a three time (consecutively) elected CM (equivalent to US Gov).

u yourself say that Trump has NO political experience...if still u find NO difference between Modi and Trump...you must give up political journalism, and get in some "page 3, or entertainment" columns!<br/><br/>
But, IF you still want to ponder on india politics, for your next article...give some thought to rahul gandhi v/s Trump comparison...you will find loads of content.

                            Your views are fine. It makes sense, as long as do not bring Mr. Modi in picture. Earlier, parallels were drawn between Mr. Modi and Mr. Obama only for campaigning style, particularly use of social media. And use of social media is in advanced stage in U.S. But the larger you shud have drawn, is about how demography is playing part with availability of technology. Young generation now have powerful technology at their use, but they lack wisdom factor. 'Smart' politicians understands this very well. They entice this voter segment, with radical words and solutions. The segment being most vulnerable, and easily exploitable, fall prey to such politician. Mr. Kejriwal is exactly doing this here. And with support of this large segment they successfully rise to their goal of grabbing power. But to draw any straight comparison either with Mr. Modi or Mr. Kejriwal is entirely misplaced. Neither of them have even 0.0001% of personal wealth as Mr. Trump.

Andrew you forgot to mention the authoritatian / fascist tendencies that both share,  along with the penchant for relentless self promotion, heightened naricissm, a willingness to bend and break the rules, a disregard for democracy (Trump is on record saying he wants to change to first amendment and Modi has been relentlessly trying to weaken democratic institutions since he came to office), hate-mongering, etc etc.

                            Please don't compare modi to Trump. Because both are coming from different background and If you saw the entire campaigning of modi then you will find that his strategy was different than Trump is doing as a republican candidate. Don't tell us about wrong and right because we are much more mature to think about our future and stop to telling us such type of creepy things.

                            It does not take a rocket scientist to understand that people vote for promoting their interests, whether economic or social, which also explains caste based politics. People casting votes for same caste candidates in India do so with the hope that their welfare will be taken care of in return. In the case of Modi, the hope was economic reform, better accountability from the government and freedom from corruption and not Hindutva as some people would like to assume. Neither is it holograms or selfies as Mr. Whitehead believes.

With Modi, there is no singling out of any state/teritorry. He has said everyone to "Make in India" not "Make in Gujarat". Everything started by him like solar power, cleanliness drive, bank account opening drive etc are for everyone and you should understand the benefit of these basic things to mass of India who are still so backward.<br/><br/>
Where is consensus missing here ??? <br/>
And I really appreciate that he doesn't go into mud slinging like Rahul, Kejriwal. That doesn't suit any leader.

                            @ Gulam Mohd. Sadiq : I appreciate AAP's initiative to remove corruption, but don't like the way they didn't do anything against Sheila. 2nd time they got full majority, still no cases, investigation ???<br/><br/>
AAP has done few things good, but then the way AK speaks doesn't fit a leader. There is a sharp difference between his and Anna Hajare way of speaking. Anna was the first target of Congress. Still see the level of speech of these two guys.<br/><br/>
I always hope that sometime these two will forgive each other and start working neutrally.
