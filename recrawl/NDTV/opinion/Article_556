Headline::::NDTV.com Exclusive: PM's Cooperative Federalism is Mere Rhetoric



DateTime::::2015-05-12T02:35:00+05:30




                                While cooperative federalism has become a popular chant, it is ironical that the honest views of the States are yet to be articulated or given due space on the important subject of resource-sharing with the Centre. There are many reasons for this.
 
One, right after accepting the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the Central Government went on a communication overdrive declaring it as a victory of the States. If the States had been won over by the Centre, why were they not celebrating? Yes, one can also turn the tables and ask why States did not protest if they had lost resources under the new financial arrangement with the Centre. Either way, it shows that the honest view of the States is yet to be articulated. Such a scenario raises fundamental questions about the idea of Cooperative Federalism.
 
Bihar was the first State to openly raise pertinent questions and pursue a policy dialogue with the Centre. I was surprised that the Centre went into a high-pitched communication overdrive immediately after accepting the recommendations of 14th Finance Commission that the share of States in tax devolution be increased from 32% to 42%. I wondered why States were not informed in right earnest about the implications of these decisions. And these implications are not merely financial. For poor States like Bihar, where millions of families depend on several welfare schemes to be able to merely survive, the implications of changes in tax devolution are vastly social. With the Centre not forthcoming with details on the implications of its decision, I immediately sensed something was not right and therefore cautioned the Centre right away against the loss that Bihar will incur under the new arrangement. Further, I immediately met Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to discuss the implications and present the stand of the Government of Bihar.
 
However, Bihar was an exception. Many affected States did not raise questions. In the high-command culture of the new BJP, many leaders including Chief Ministers consider it risky to question or debate a policy where the Prime Minister and his Government have taken a point of view. Also, it is convenient to look at the response of Bihar through the political prism and discount it as the criticism or opposition of a political opponent. However, one must be able to distinguish policy, politics and the opinion of States from that of the Centre, independent of the ruling dispensation. This is necessary for India to become a more vibrant and resilient democracy with a federal structure. So, in this spirit, India needs an open dialogue between the Centre and the States on the implications of the new devolution regime ushered in by the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission.
I met the Prime Minister to represent the interests of Bihar. However, one State cannot articulate the collective viewpoints of all States with respect to sharing of resources between the Centre and the State. In the spirit of cooperative federalism, the Central Government should consider an open meeting comprising Chief Ministers and key officials of all States. In such a meeting, the Centre must explain the new provisions, while each State should be given an opportunity to present its stand on sharing of resources, and the same should be heard and valued with an open mind.
 
With verifiable facts and figures, the Bihar Government has apprised the Central Government about a significant decrease in funds. A detailed analysis of the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the Economic Survey of India 2014-15, and the Central Budget 2015-16 has revealed that while on one hand, tax devolution to the States is being increased, on the other hand, the budgetary support by the Central Government to States for the implementation of welfare and other important schemes is being significantly reduced. Several schemes earmarked under the state plan have been dropped, and funds have been cut for most of the centrally-sponsored Schemes.
 
Bihar faces extra-ordinary socio-economic challenges which cannot be confronted without adequate resources. Yet, the State will lose in a big way as per the new mechanism. Based on the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, Bihar will get only 9.665% share in tax devolution as compared to 10.9% that was earmarked for the State in the 13th Finance Commission. As per preliminary calculations, Bihar will lose more than Rs. 10,000 crore in 2015-16, alone when the share in central taxes plus the cuts in various schemes are considered. This will obviously handicap the State from enabling better education, health, skill development, infrastructure development and much more.
 
Bihar is already faced with uncertainty in the release of more than Rs. 8200 crore allocated under the Special Plan for Bihar. The Central Government has worsened the scenario by closing other channels such as the Planning Commission and the Backward Region Grant Fund. The Central Government has not adhered to the suggestion of the 14th Finance Commission that "to the extent that formula-based transfers do not meet the needs of specific States, they need to be supplemented by grants-in aid on an assured basis and in a fair manner." Even the announcement of Special Assistance to Bihar and West Bengal on the lines of Andhra Pradesh by the Finance Minister in the Budget Speech has not fructified in any affirmative action.
 
Policy and not politics is the answer. At a time when even a simplistic analysis reveals that Central Government has handicapped Bihar through severe and inexplicable reduction of resources, the politics of BJP is on a different plane. The BJP is advertising that in less than a year, the Central Government has doled out a bonanza of more than 1 lakh crore to the State. Such packaging of half-truths is a cruel joke on the people of Bihar.
 
What is the model of Cooperative Federalism that the BJP Government envisions? Where is the voice of States individually and collectively in this vision? When the Planning Commission was disbanded, the collective voice of the States was inaudible. This was the forum that used to enable engagement between the Centre and the States related to resources, knowledge and coordination. So far, no institution or process has filled this space. The story is repeating with respect to the new resource-sharing mechanism initiated by the 14th Finance Commission. Once again, the voice of the States is not audible in shaping the policy approach. Instead, what stands visible is a massive Public Relations overdrive by the Centre and a packaging of a one-sided narrative of the policy.
 
Can such contradictions continue with the rhetoric of Cooperative Federalism? I don't think it should? In the interest of Bihar and the voice of States, I will continue to engage, take a stand and call for action so that the Centre does not forget that while the power lies with the Centre, the People of India live in the States. And the interest of the People is supreme.(Nitish Kumar is Chief Minister of Bihar.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

After having allied with the Mulayams and Lalu's you have no right to talk about governance. only hope that people of Bihar teach you and your gang a proper lesson.

                            Co-operative federalism also means the states (concerned parties) support crucial bills introduced in Parliament irrespective of party in national interest....instead you ppl are playing dirty politics of not allowing the Parliament to function.....

                            sir, when modi said states will get 42% of share means, the stats also need to contribute more amount to get more share.. You need to enlighten your people to put their hard work and provide a scope to work.  Dont make people just to depend on welfare schemes as they also have productivity and as a leader you should use this opportunity to extract their productivity.  I can see lot number of people coming to south india in search of jobs and earn here, while they also get social benefits in your state.  Provide a scope for their development and your state can also make money.  You did not meet with any uncertainity like AP where they earned and invested in HYD and now entire wealth has been taken away, sorry stolen away by Telangana.

                            Sour grapes. If it was not benefiting the states why are all the other states silent on it and not protesting instead ?  Bihar is poor because of people like u nitinish and lalu have been constantly looting the state.  It is not the poor which is living on the social welfare schemes.  But it is you and your gang of corrupts living on the social welfare schemes ( read scams) so stop talking rubbish and start working honestly your state will grow automatically.  By targeting Our PM you are only shooting in your own foot !

                            This Article is written by Mr Pavankumar varma, an opportunistic bureaucrat. A simple math would tell you.. 9+ percentage of 42% devolution is higher than 10 percent of 32% state share.Unless you put an effort for economic revolution in Bihar, you will be on mercy of centre's aid all the time.. Which won't be sufficient for a state which was  revenue deficient state for decade's thanks to nitish's now friend Laalu.<br/>
I have one simple question.. Mamata asks for 2 lakhs+ crores of Debt waiver.. Nitish asks for nearly 40 thousand crores of special grants,Andhra asks for special package thanks to bifurcation, Maharashtra farmers are in distress,Rahul Gandhi asks for loan waiver.. you people don't let the government build any new infrastructure for new jobs and new income to be created. how long this country will run this kind of charity,where is the new income,new jobs? just the social justice wont give you social equality.. that comes with one's economic freedom to earn and spend for their own life.

                            I don't understand logic in Nitish's politics. Since he been CM of Bihar, most of the time he spent is fighting central govt. First UPA and now NDA. How poor Bihar grow when CM of the state see central govt as its permanent enemy? He claims Bihar need help from central govt, but his politics is always against them? It is sad reality for Bihar that it had a CM which believes in political survival rather than development of its people. I don't know if BJP is good or bad for Bihar, but I can certainly say that Nitesh is opportunist politician who can never do any good to its people…Can congress do it..? perhaps yes, can Lalu? may be not…Can Kejriwal? Certainly not…Nitish? Absolutely not….5 more years of Nitesh/ Lalu is HELL ALL OVER BIHAR!

For Overall comparison with all opposition govt. either at center in past or at present in some states like Bihar we see who is working &amp; who does the blame game. End of the day even politician has a job &amp; work to perform. I am not religious bias but this govt. actually moving the things in right direction. Some of the Congress BLIND BHAKTS for more than 55 years have developed Permanent BLINDNESS so they cant see the direction..which is quite understandable. PERIOD.

                            To start with, these are not the words of Nitish; he is far too inarticulate to pen such words.  I would venture to suggest that these are the words of Pawan Verma or some other similar Modi Basher.  The rest of us Indians ask simple questions: Why has Bihar always been the begging bowl of India? Why hasn't Bihar attracted any sort of worthwhile industry to speak of? Why are Bihari qualifications regarded as a joke (pictures of industrial scale cheating are still doing the rounds of the world)?  Why are industrial scale scam artists such as Lalu given hero status in Bihar? Why does Bihar indulge in industrial scale export of slum dwellers to other states (the Nirbhaya rapists were all Bihari)? The problems of Bihar are the responsibility of Biharis, not the Centre or other States.  When politicians such as Nitish try and wield power out of all proportion to the contribution Bihar makes to the wellbeing of the nation, an example of this being Nitish breaking away from BJP while calculating that Modi was unelectable and therefore if he were to ally with Congress, he stood every chance of being PM, the rest of India resents this.  It is time Biharis took charge of their own destiny and stopped being a burden on the rest of us Indians.  Aggressive begging does not go down well with hard working, honest Indians, particularly when Bihar contributes absolutely ZERO to India.

                            Dear Mr. Nitish Kumar,<br/>
I patiently read your "articulation" till end to find out if "cooperative federalism" is a rhetoric. My impression is your articulation is pure rhetoric. I wish you had pointed out -<br/>
a. Why situation of Bihar is exceptional? Some facts and figures please. Rhetoric of being backward is not right articulation.<br/>
b. Collective position v/s individual position - Again here I failed to read how Bihar firstly and later all states get a raw deal under new scheme of things. It is understandable that individual view may be different than collective view and hence protection may be sought to ensure no adverse effect.<br/>
c. Why it is right for other states to pay for your states? It should not be political reason but policy reason. In other words you are still wish to indulge in politics and not play by policy.

                            Dear Chief Minister, how long you will survive by only practicing dirty politics,please care for the problems of the people in your state. Today Patna is a city with garbage filled streets, lack of basic municipal facilities beyond you and your ministerial colleagues' posh official residence. Clogged drains, no roads worth walking a few kilometers,encroachment all along the roads is what Patna all about, one can guess about other places.Virtually no municipal facility exists beyond the VIP areas.<br/>
In your long tenure not much changed in terms of college and university education, people still have to go out of state to study,work and make a livelihood.<br/>
Why corporates still fear entering Bihar to set up manufacturing units, ur dirty politics has again saddened people of Bihar, its back to days of Lalu raj full of fear for a common man. The rich and powerful local dons are your supporters and you don't want to touch them.<br/>
We are counting days for next Assembly elections for a change but it will be better if you could just concentrate on administration in your remaning tenure rather than in rhetorics.

                            Whatever said and done, Nitish Kumar does make sense here. Let's not dismiss his views only because he's not with the BJP anymore, his arguments do have substance

                            Lets forget for a moment that Nitish has done a lot of political blunders and think about the issue. <br/>
The tax collected by the center is ultimately spent on the people whether it is through states or through central plans or any other method. In the new scheme, the weight of population has decreased, while for area and forest cover it has increased. Meaning Bihar would get lesser share in the direct devolution because of its small area and small forest cover (only 6.5%). Also, it would lose on the account of planned schemes and backward region grant fund (36 out 38 districts of Bihar received funds under this).. <br/>
The new devolution formula is rational. But a state like Bihar that is already grappling with resource crunch has to be provided a short term package to compensate the immediate loss, just like Tamil Nadu would get in case of GST even though Tamil Nadu is not a poor state.. <br/>
But Tamil Nadu would actually get it, Bihar wont. Because people here have become pro party or pro personality (pro Modi or anti modi) and no one seems to be pro Bihar. Unfortunate it is!

                            you and your party lost deposit, so you should quit politics. Modi has gone from a rioter to national hero becoz people like you could not perform. After Gujarat riots all parties turned blind eye to punishment of the guilty. Today those same guilty made you taste dust. Next time do raj dharam, and punish the guilty irrespective of state, religion, cast or race.

                            The honourable Chief Minister of Bihar,Mr.Nitish kumar, very logically and statistically exposed the rhetoric of Modi govt. about its "Co-operative Federalism" concept newly coined phrase of Mr.Modi. It seems it look like yet another novel phrase coined by Mr.Modi during election time like "AACHE DIN", "BRINGING BLACK MONEY AND DEPOSITING 15LACS TO PEOPLE'S BANK ACCOUNT","SWATCH BHARAT" ETC. People has voted BJP to power to see real development reaches their home and not the rhetorics even after completing one year in office. In this one year we see no development programme started really by this govt. which reached the people.

                            Nitish, stop whining. When the Central Govt gives you more money, it has to take away from somewhere. Money doesn't grow on trees. As usual, you are quoting selective facts to make your point. We the public just see you as an attention hungry politician, who thought he might become PM of India by opposing Modi. Just focus on transforming Bihar; if you do, you may get the chance to become PM. That is the route Modi took.

                            Reading the article fully- only in one place he has mentioned that 10.9% to 9.66%. except that there is no information except commenting about the process than numbers. <br/><br/>
Nitish should have come out with proper detailed numbers. Lack of these numbers indicate -it is a political article than a financial or a developmental issue.

                            MR Kumar, try to understand this, you want your state to be economically forward for that to happen people should start working for that to happen they should have jobs to have jobs you need industries. For how long can government keep giving free bees? Your new friends MR Yadavs are renowned for looting people's money and I am very sure you are also same, even if Central government pays more for your poor state (sad to say yours is the poorest in India) you will end up looting and hardly any will reach people! <br/>
Ask yourself why your State is still backward economically and other states have gone forward the answer lies within ( you and Mr Yadav). <br/>
Instead of asking more from Central government think how much your state can contribute to Country's economy.

                            I have witnessed over the years that there is contently barrage of negative and cynical belief being enforced in the minds of people of India by politicians and media making their judgemental power weak and weaker. All the time you hear about politics, religion, culture, celebrations, business, stock market,clerics, pundits projected as anti-national and anti-social elements who are eating public money. There is half truth but other side of truth is all these have flourished and prospered over the years at the cost of public. Because people follow all nonsense cynical and negative propaganda and their brains become prisoners of propaganda by media. People by and large restricted their freedom to think and freedom to analyse facts because 24/7 media dependency for brain to react on media driven agenda and conclusions.This addiction to make brain dead.

                            There is substance in what Nitish Kumar says. While it is a common practice to talk of India as a country, it has to be borne in mind that India is not a homogenous entity. In reality, it is a conglomeration of many states and erstwhile kingdoms. The country of India emerged after centuries of Mughal and British rule. Prior to them the sub continent was ruled by hundreds of kings and rulers who ruled over small parts of the land. The vestiges of this historical past are still in evidence everywhere. The only time that the common man thinks of India as a country is when there is an international cricket match between India and other countries, or during times of crisis like a war. Otherwise, most people of the country think more in terms of their state, their religion and their caste. So, for all of Modi's talk about building the nation, it is just not possible by treating the country as a monolithic whole where one rule only applies. The RSS vision of the country is not based in reality, but a figment of imagination borne during British rule. Their 'Bharat Mata' is non-existent in real life. The sooner Narendra Modi, the BJP and the RSS realize this, the better. Unless states are brought into confidence, and developmental measures are taken after consensus with the states, the BJP is bound to lose in the long term. Their north Indian based Brahminical vision for the country is not acceptable to many in the country. It is not just Modi who is running the BJP. The RSS and other right wing groups are also hard at work behind the scenes. There are several fringe elements comprising of north Indian Hindi chauvinists, Brahmins, other so called upper caste apologists and sundry narrow minded groups with hidden agendas who are at work behind the scenes. Sooner or later, these elements are bound to come out with their handiwork, and it will lay the seeds for the BJP's downfall.

                            Nitish cannot be taken seriously as he has not yet forgotten humiliation in the hands of Modi in 2014 and is still licking the wounds. It is better he concentrate on governance in the jungle raj which Bihar is again plunged into. has made up his mind to oppose any thing and every thing from Central Government. He himself lacks vision of running the country and does not think beyond casteist and communal politics.

Gujaraat had damaged completely during 2001 in Earth quake Mr modi restored and brought back without the centre help to the top. why mr nitish always weeping. u only repaired some roads and lawfulness in which BJP also have the share of credit. after BJP gone nitish did nothing and nitish always has the habit of (dog version because dog never had a habit of working on its own and earn for its lovelyhoods it always had a nature to sablusy to his malik for his meals u may compare it with other animals as they can search foods on its hard work and ate but the pet never) riding over some ones shoulder. first Fernandez then BJP now lalu mulayam. if he had a courage he has to fight on his own like jaya mamta even maya. otherwise merge it with other party and work under them. he want ride over them to raise his height and not always to raise others height or mutual.
