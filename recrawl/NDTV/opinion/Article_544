Headline::::The Battle Within Indian Army For Promotions



DateTime::::2015-05-05T03:50:00+05:30




                                The Supreme Court is currently hearing a case that is likely to have serious implications for the cohesion and ethos of the Indian army. The matter pertains to the policy adopted by the Army Headquarters in 2009 for promotions of officers of the rank of Colonel, Brigadier, Major General and Lieutenant General. A group of nearly 200 serving army officers have challenged this policy, which grants disproportionate vacancies to two arms - the infantry and artillery - and so stunts the career prospects of officers from others arms and services.
In March 2015, the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT), which is the departmental tribunal of the military, effectively vindicated the stance of the petitioners by holding that the army's policy violated Article 14 of the Constitution which guarantees the right of equality of opportunity. In response to an appeal by the government, the Supreme Court has stayed the AFT's ruling, but has urged the government to expedite its submissions.
The mere fact that such a large number of officers have chosen the path of litigation underscores the salience of the issue and the simmering discontent in the army. Unless, tactfully handled the outcome of this legal battle might deeply dent the professionalism of the army.
The root of the problem stretches all the way back to the Kargil Review Committee (KRC) of 1999, which recommended reducing the average age of battalion and brigade commanders - i.e., colonels and brigadiers - to enable higher operational efficacy. The KRC was arguably barking up the wrong tree. Enhanced combat effectiveness would actually require reducing the average age of Junior Commissioned Officers, who are typically in their 40s, and at the sharp edge of combat as platoon commanders.  
Be that as it may, in July 2001, the Ministry of Defence constituted the Ajay Vikram Singh Committee-named after the able bureaucrat who led the exercise-to address this issue as well as the related one of limited career progression and thwarted aspirations in the army owing to its steeply pyramidal rank structure. The committee came up with a series of short and longer term proposals aimed at pulling more officers up the chain of command, while peeling off those who had no avenue of advancement.
The short-term measures included increasing vacancies for the ranks of colonel and above: 1484 colonels, 222 brigadiers, 75 major generals, and 20 lieutenant generals. In addition a range of other "peel" measures were suggested including lateral absorption in the government, voluntary retirement scheme and so forth. The longer-term measures recommended an increase in both the intake of Short Service Commissioned Officers (SSCOs) and their ratio vis-a-vis Permanent Commissioned Officers. To make the SSC attractive, the committee recommended steps such as lump-sum grants at the end of the tenure, grant of professional training leave, relaxation of age of entering the civil services and so on.
In retrospect, the committee's pronouncement on the length of the tenures of commanding officers (colonels) proved to be fateful. The panel recommended command tenure of 2.5 years for infantry units; 3 years for artillery, armoured corps, mechanised infantry; 4 years for air defence, engineers and signals; and 5 years for the ordnance and supply corps as well as electrical and mechanical engineers. This decision, taken without any compelling reasoning, gave the infantry an edge in vacancies for promotion. This was over and above the extra 20 per cent accruing to the combat arms - infantry, armour and artillery - under the pro rata scheme, which calculated vacancies for each arm and service in proportion to the number of officers serving in them (below the rank of colonel).
Yet, this laying of down of tenures did not have a totally lopsided impact. In fact, the committee explicitly urged caution in implementing its call for increased vacancies. In 2004, the government announced the release of 750 colonel vacancies in the first phase of implementation. Between February 2004 and September 2006, the average years of service of Colonels selected by promotion boards dropped from 18 to 16 years. The fact that infantry secured nearly a third of these vacancies was not seen as a major or iniquitous departure from the past trend.
In 2009, the Army Headquarters abruptly shifted its policy on promotions. The powers that were used the committee's pronouncement on differing length of tenures to skew the game in favour of infantry and artillery. The pro-rata model was thrown overboard. A new "command exit" model apparently drawing on the committee's recommendation was promulgated. This computed vacancies for colonels in various arms and services by factoring in the length of command tenure. In effect, the disparity between the tenures of commanding officers in, say, the infantry and the ordnance corps entitled the infantry to far more additional vacancies. Thus, during the second phase of implementation, the infantry garnered 441 of the 734 new vacancies: a whopping 77 per cent increase from the first phase. The artillery registered a 53 per cent increase over the two phases. And almost all other branches saw a steep drop in the vacancies allotted to them.
It is no coincidence that successive army chiefs from 2008 have belonged to the artillery and infantry. In fact, the policy was stoutly opposed by several senior lieutenant generals, including army commanders. The Armed Forces Tribunal ruling goes so far as to call the shift in policy "a malicious act". The implications of rigging the colonel vacancies for higher ranks are obvious. The very idea of a "general cadre" from the rank of brigadier stands vitiated.
The Army Headquarters and the Ministry of Defence are arguing that there was no shift in policy in 2009: the army was consistently implementing the committee's recommendations. But the fact remains that between 2004 and 2007, the pro rata system was left unchanged. The Ministry was evidently unaware of the Army Headquarters' policy either in 2004 or in 2009. Either way, it throws unflattering light on the state of civilian control over the military under the previous government.
Whichever way the Supreme Court rules, the army leadership's willingness to play fast-and-loose with so central an issue as promotions does not augur well for the institution. Notwithstanding their formal legal stance, it is incumbent upon the Defence Minister and the Army Chief to take a broad and sympathetic view of the positions espoused by officers from various parts of the army. The damage wrought since 2009 will have to be repaired. In particular, invidious argument that infantry deserves special treatment because it bears the brunt of combat needs to be buried. The army fights as an integrated force in counterinsurgency as much as conventional conflict. As a former infantry officer, I find this claim for affirmative action contemptible.
More importantly, the controversy should not lead to a wholesale abandonment of the sensible recommendations made by the Ajay Vikram Singh Committee. In order to ensure career satisfaction for permanent commissioned officers, it is imperative to increase the intake of SSCOs and so reduce the pressure on the number of contenders for senior ranks. This issue has hung fire for the past decade. If anything, there has been a regression. The SSC used to be a five-year commission with the option of a five-year extension. But now there is a lock-in period of ten years-a duration that would render most officers unfit for a serious civilian career. In consequence, not only has intake failed to increase, but over 60 per cent of SSCOs seek to opt for a permanent commission. Reversing this trend is crucial to restoring the battered organizational balance and cohesion of the army.(Srinath Raghavan is Senior Fellow at Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi)The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            When a Gentleman Cadet in academy fills his choice of arms, what really he thinks of. Those who opt for ASC, AOC or other services, without doubt, have a wishlist of easy life, better postings, family life and relaxed working environment. Whereas an infantarian is deprived of all these. When it comes to climbing high altitudes and deploying in the god forsaken remotest areas, infantry is pushed in. Where were my friends and AFT who are now crying discrimination over promotion. Let there be no discrimination in hardship, deprivation, postings and pain as well.

                            What are you talking boss ? The infantry divn in any army are like the fighter pilots in any air force. The artillery division also plays a very vital role but they and all other units of any army support the infantry. Wars are lost and won because of a highly motivated and well trained infantry with good back up from other units and the air force/navy (as required) . They are the ones that take the largest hit in terms of lives in a war.

                            For all those of you commenting, I have to commend your powers of observation, for not a single one of you seems to have notice that the author of the said article has mentioned in the article, that he's an Ex-Infantry officer. And as for your holier than thou attitude that, that the other arms of the armed forces don't deserve recognition is grossly misplaced. And if even for a second I were to accept your argument, then let me bring up the case of Mechanised Infantry/Brigade of Guards, soldiers who have been trained to operate as Infantry Combatants along with having been imparted the skills of operating armoured vehicles, which means in most ways they are better trained than regular infantry battalions, but you know what... They too have been robbed of the opportunity of career progression. <br/>
You all ought to get your facts straight, before nitpicking the authors work. And more importantly give due respect to all soldiers irrespective of the fact whether they are in the infantry or not, saying or doing so otherwise is the greatest disservice you could do to them.

                            When a cadet is commissioned he is not informed that Infantry and Artillery officers will get faster promotions. When I joined Engineers I found I was first in battle and last out. I had to be and was fitter than Infantry and Artillery officers. I risked my life even during peace times clearing old land mines. No Brigadiers and above fight hand to hand battles and so why should they be younger than other Arms and Services officers. In the old days Lt Cols commanded units and it worked well right upto the 1971 war which we won. Why was the rank upgraded making the COs older? The JCOs are above 40 years old so why doesn't thus logic be applied to them? It is a clear case of Infantry and Artillery officers wanting the whole cake and eat it all!

                            The root cause of the Kargil failure has been documented. The officer nearest to the spot noticed incursions and reported it to his higher ups, who either hushed it or did not pay attention to it. If the detected incursions had been addressed promptly it would be less costly (in terms of lives lost by our Army).<br/><br/>
This problem is not unique to the Army. It was rampant in the private sector, wherein customer/ employee complaints and changes in the market place or work place were not acted upon. The private sector woke up to this problem and reduced the number of layers in the hierarchy but retained the number of designations purely for motivation reasons. <br/><br/>
Between the sales man in the field or the operator on the machine, and the head of the profit center, there can be a maximum of 2 layers. This ensures that every layer of management provides 'leadership' and does so in time. <br/><br/>
If the accountability of each higher layer is sufficiently challenging, there automatically fewer aspirants. For e.g. in the IT industry, many 'managers' do want to become a 'vice president' because they would then be answerable for revenue and pipeline. Similarly many 'vice presidents' do not want to become a 'profit center head' because of the costs it imposes in terms of work-life (im)balance. The same is true in banks; in some of the private sector banks the quality of life is inversely proportional to your rank in the organization. <br/><br/>
If the army addresses this issue of 'layers' it would ensure the root cause of Kargil is taken care of; but if they use Kargil episode to play games like skewing the promotion opportunities, they will not only fail to solve the current problems, they will definitely create new problems.

                            This is what happens when you have incompetent people heading the nation and the defence. Antony was honest but was inefficient and an idiot of the 7th category to the core. About Manmohan Singh, the less said the better. The yes ma'm chamcha of Congress has ruined many institutions of the country. We wish we don't have such chamchas again in any party that is in power. May the force be with us.

                            The comments above only cement the author's opinion on the consequences in Army. <br/><br/>
I wonder if such force of acumen (as in the comments above) is applied to an all encompassing issue of NFU for Armed forces... Something, that cuts across the mandalisation of Army!

                            The whole arguments are based on prejudices, imagined inequalities and undue sense of discrimination. Army as an organisation is required to remain geared up for its main task - that is war or warlike situation as also remain embroiled constantly in ensuring territorial integrity of the country. Given the terrain conditions of our borders and other operations like internal insurgencies / terrorism, there is no choice for the country as also for the Army but to keep continuously deployed its Infantry. Infantry is the sword Arm and shall continue to be so given this context. Hence younger profiles and shorter tenures of the Commanding officers is an organisational and functional necessity. Equating the tenure of Commanding officer of Ordinance unit or Armour unit or Mechanised unit in peace with that of Infantry battalion in Drass or Kargil or Kibithu is but being unrealistic and foolish. The whole theory of desirability of younger and shorter profiles in Infantry can not be quashed. Arguments that by serving in Infantry units for  two to three years makes one qualified and deserving to claim same advantages in Armour or Ordinance are not tenable. <br/><br/>
Author's logic is purely theoretical. If he was an infantryman that by itself does not provide weight to his arguments. The organisation needs to be task oriented and mission fulfilling for which young profiles and shorter tenures of Commanding officers of Armoured units, Ordinance or ASC in equivalence of requirements of Infantry are not justifiable from  functional requirement view. <br/><br/>
If it is supper night carry on then what will be the incentive for any one to join infantry. Then they will all be casualties and the Sword Arm of India will be blunted beyond repair.. <br/><br/>
If these fallacious arguments of equality of opportunities are taken a little further, then the natural consequence will be a debate if at all India needs to have "Services in Uniform"/ or if at all an officer deserves to be Colonel who has not served on border / operational areas for about five years in his 16 / 17 years service when he comes up for selection to that rank.<br/><br/>
There would be no end to it.

                            Facts as stated by the writer, A<br/>
1. AV Singh committee recommended that tenure of CO of Infantry unit be 2.5 years.<br/>
2. This recommendation was accepted by the government (Employer).<br/>
3. Government released additional 1484 Colonel, 222 Brigadiers, 75 Major General and 20 Lieutenant General vacancies to implement said recommendations.But the recommendations implemented with slant in favour of other-than-Infantry. Because first trance of 754 Colonel vacancies distributed pro-rata, while it should have been done as per AV Singh recommendation regarding Command Tenure.<br/>
4. Army partially corrected this slant in 2009. Justice demands that all vacancies of Colonel and above ranks be distributed strictly in accordance with AV Singh Committee recommendations of Command Tenure.

                            Article on disparity in promotions in army has aptly brought out all issue, however to add to the woos frequent changes in promotion policies in terms of "quantification system", grant of redrassal, working out of batch vacancies, ACR appraisal system are flawed and subject to corrupt practices and manipulation. The only solution lies in enhancing satisfaction level by increasing promotional avenues upto Brig level as short term measure.  In the long term Armed forces to follow Two Up promotion policy  in case of Lt Col And Col for promotions to Time scale Brigs and Maj Gens i.e, LtCol to Timescale Brig and Col to Timescale Maj Gen in the long term. Point to be noted that there is disparity in promotions amongest three services i.e, in Navy Commodore is a time scale/ non select rank.Moreover, this would be apt alternative for grant of NFU status increase in age of Offrs. Just imagine the satisfaction level and motivation within armed forces Offrs. It would also improve the quality of offrs and intake level without any advertisements.
