Headline::::How Modi Government Is Undermining Indian Education



DateTime::::2015-05-01T23:26:00+05:30




                                One issue that has not received the attention it deserves from observers of the Modi sarkar has been its treatment of education. We have all heard for some time about the demographic dividend that awaits our nation from its youthful population, but we can only reap that dividend if we train and educate our young people to be able to take advantage of what the world has to offer them in the 21st century. Otherwise, the Naxalite menace shows us how easily the demographic dividend can become a disaster: there is nothing more dangerous to the nation than legions of under-educated, unemployed and unemployable young men with no stake in our society. This is why I have often argued that education in India is not just a socio-economic issue, but a national security issue as well.
But the Modi Sarkar's performance in education so far does not inspire confidence. Its budgetary allocations tell the tale. The overall education budget is down from Rs. 82,771 cr to Rs. 69,074 cr. Whereas under the UPA, the Plan allocation went up by 18 per cent in 2012-13 and by 8.03 per cent in 2013-14, the BJP Govt has reduced the Plan allocation for 2015-16 by 24.68 per cent. The savage cuts go across the board: the flagship Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan has been reduced by 22.14 per cent, funding for the Mid-Day Meal Scheme by 16.41 per cent, the Rashtriya Madhyama Shiksha Abhiyan for secondary education by 28.7 per cent and the Rashtriya Uchhattar Shiksha Abhiyan, to support state colleges, by 48 per cent. To take just one example, the SSA, which funds schools across the country: MHRD had asked for Rs. 50,000 cr in 2015-16; it received Rs. 22,000 cr from the Modi sarkar's current Budget.
How can the government's grandiose targets - and more important, the nation's indispensable objectives - be achieved? The onus will be on the States, but they are the ones clamouring for more Central assistance. Formerly, the Central government had shared its RTE budget with states on a 65:35 proportion (90:10 in the NorthEast) but most states had been unable to provide their share. (When I was Minister, I recall that Rajasthan, for instance, didn't pay teachers' salaries till Central funds were received). Now, presumably, the share expected from our cash-strapped and governance-challenged states will be higher - and their failure bigger.
What monitoring mechanisms is the cash-strapped MHRD devising? Now that the Planning Commission has been abolished, who is going to perform its oversight role?
In higher education, we have long lamented that not a single Indian university is in the top 200 of any of the global rankings. But look at the non-seriousness of the BJP's approach to our flagship IIT system. They have announced the creation of five new IITs with a grand total investment of Rs. 1000 crore - but the Government's own Detailed Project Report specifies that the cost of establishing an IIT is Rs. 2200 cr over a period of 7 years: in other words, each new IIT needs an annual expenditure of around Rs. 310 crore a year. Mr Jaitley's allocations fall dramatically short of that - and this excludes any amount which may be needed for completing the construction of previously announced IITs. Inadequate funding has compromised the quality of education in all newly established IITs and IIMs, with the government rolling out more such institutions without strengthening the existing infrastructure.
This is just one example. The reduced allocations across the board do not match the 12th Plan objectives regarding expansion, growth, access, or quality of Higher Education. The 12th Plan approach paper had proposed that 18 per cent of all Government education spending or 1.12 per cent of GDP should be on Higher Education, and Parliament's Standing Committee on HRD recommended raising it to 25 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively. Instead, this government is going in the opposite direction.
The picture of enrolment is more encouraging, but offset by an alarming level of dropouts. Our Gross Enrolment Ratio at primary level is high (over 101 per cent) but so is the dropout rate - about 30 per cent drop out by Class 8. You can't educate them if they're not in school. MHCR has also released figures of 60 lakh out-of-school children; according to the Ministry's 'Education for All' report to UNESCO in 2012, this had declined to 30 lakhs just 2 years ago, which suggests that the trend is reversing. When I pointed this out in the Lok Sabha, Education Minister Smriti Irani declared that my math was wrong. It isn't, but perhaps one of MHRD's figures is.
My concern about this situation is that SC/ST children and those from disadvantaged communities are disproportionately missing out. It is clear that they are not taking advantage of schemes like the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (residential schools in which 75 per cent seats are reserved for SC/ST/OBC/minorities). The Centre also says it will no longer support states in building 6000 model schools in educationally backward districts. Announcing Central objectives and expecting the States to fund them is a peculiar hallmark of this government. But it is not going to transform this country in any domain, least of all education.
Take Kendriya Vidyalayas. Demand for KVs has been going up: most Indians want quality education that's also affordable. But again, more Central investment is required in the scheme. For the six KV seats I'm entitled to allot under the MP's quota, I had 459 requests from constituents. The increase from six seats to ten proposed by the Standing Committee and recommended by the Minister won't come close to overcoming the demand/supply mismatch. The only answer lies in creating 500 more KVs across the country, as UPA wanted to do. The BJP has given no resources for this. Nor does it plan to enhance the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, highly sought-after residential schools for the mainly rural poor. It should ideally create JNVs for specially disadvantaged groups, like the fishing community in the coastal areas.
An educated country needs good teachers, and enough of them. But only 63 per cent of government schools have a Pupil-Teacher ratio as per RTE norms (30:1 primary, 35:1 upper primary). According to the RTE Act, the prescribed norm had to be reached by March 2015: what is government doing about it?
We have a shortage of trained teachers as well as training institutes. There are 6 lakh posts of teachers vacant under the SSA. Even in the KVs, 7698 out of 44,529 sanctioned teaching posts are vacant; so are 50 per cent of positions in teacher-training institutions. Most teacher training colleges, as the Verma Committee observed, are so bad they should be closed down. If we train teachers badly, they will teach children badly. A serious initiative by MHRD is needed: urgent recruitment, more Teacher Eligibility Tests, remedial training. Instead we have a level of governmental inattention to the crisis that matches our notorious culture of teacher absenteeism. The picture is even worse in higher education: Central Universities, IITs, NITs, IIMs, are all suffering crippling shortages of teachers.
As a result, the quality of education continues to suffer. Learning outcomes in our school system remain weak. The National Achievement Survey, PISA and other measurements show that not even half the children in Class V can read a Class II text. The government seems bereft of ideas to remedy this.
One of the areas the government should be able to have a direct impact upon is infrastructure. But construction delays are affecting 177 KVs (including Pangode in my own constituency). Only 52 per cent of schools have a playground; only 83 per cent have a girls' toilet. (MHRD's own figures show 2 lakh schools without toilets and 5.2 lakh without playgrounds.)
Performance indicators make dismal reading. Take the scheme to set up girls' hostels in all Educationally Backward Blocks: 3453 were approved, only 536 are functional. Only 69 per cent of the kitchens-cum-stores sanctioned for the mid-day meal programme have been constructed; the quality of food served remains a widespread concern, and not only because of the Bihar tragedy in which dozens of children died; teachers remain reluctant to supervise the cooking or taste the food. These are all issues the government could fix, but it will take resources, including more honoraria to the cooks/helpers. Instead, the mid-day meal budget has been cut by the government.
With this record of under-performance, it's troubling that the government is busy undermining the autonomy of institutions of higher education. There is widespread concern about the announced resignations of key academic leaders, from the Chairman of the Board of Governors of IIT-Bombay, to the IIT-Delhi Director, the NCERT Director, and even the Chairman of the National Book Trust, the eminent Malayalam writer Sethumadhavan, seven months before the expiry of his term. Sethu had published 17 novels and 20 collections of short stories, so at least the Book Trust was headed by someone who had written books - but the new regime has predictably replaced him with the former editor of the RSS mouthpiece, Panchajanya. A similar attempt to remove Delhi University VC Dinesh Singh has been held up by President Mukherjee seeking further clarifications.
Saffronisation seems to be the name of the game. Can the Minister say that the new VC of Benares Hindu University, a prant-level official of the RSS with very slender academic credentials and no books on his CV, is worthy of a position formerly held by the likes of Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Acharya Narendra Dev? What are the qualifications of Mr Y Sudershan Rao to Chair the Indian Council of Historical Research - other than his Hindutva views?
It's not just appointments. MHRD's directive to educational institutions to observe 25 December as Good Governance Day, requiring the physical presence of students on the Christmas holiday, was an anti-national step. So was the instruction to set up separate vegetarian canteens at the IITs (I am vegetarian myself, but my intellectual contact with my fellow students was never, and should not be, limited by what they eat.) We need an assurance from the government that it will uphold the integrity of educational attainment in India beyond religious considerations.
The supposedly autonomous University Grants Commission has become a poodle, being instructed to issue a directive to Delhi University to withdraw its four-year Undergraduate Programme abruptly, and to disqualify all other universities from offering such courses. (The UGC's craven political expediency in reversing its own previous decisions on laughable grounds is another embarrassment.)
Equally dismaying is the new MHRD instruction that it must be informed before any MoUs with foreign universities are signed. This is contrary to the Acts governing institutions like IITS, NITs, and Central Universities, which give them the power to enter into academic collaborations with other educational institutions, including foreign ones. The previous NDA government had done the same thing; in August 2004, UPA withdrew that requirement, saying it was "unnecessary interference in the autonomy of institutions". With the BJP back in power, autonomy is again history.
Our educational system is over-regulated and under-governed. I hope this government will rethink the disastrous course upon which it has embarked, and revive the UPA proposal to abolish UGC and AICTE and create an overarching Council of Higher Education to facilitate, rather than restrict, educational autonomy. Excellence can only thrive amid freedom. Sadly, the BJP Government does not appear to believe either in promoting freedom or financing excellence.

                            Excellent article. <br/>
The problem here is that people are so stuck with the development propaganda (only industries) that other important aspects of it are given no importance at all. Congress was guilty of corruption and now BJP is going in all the horrible possible directions.

                            The most important thing is not higher education but education upto class XII. We have destroyed the entire system of evaluation upto class X. CBSE upgrades a student in MATHS because he is good in Yoga. This is the most foolish system of evaluation adopted by the board. It has been my observation that in order to improve results, marks in one part of curriculum are reduced because students get lower marks in them and increase where students get higher marks. this is ridiculous. improvement of result seems to be the only moto. All yard sticks of evaluating a student have been diluted. I have met students studying in class X who cannot read text properly. Mr Modi's government has worked for 1 year only and Tharoor is not writing about the 60 years of congress rule.

                            Mr. Tharoor,<br/><br/>
I have always liked how articulate you are. However, I have also thought of you  as a person who rallies for Congress for your personal gains. Your books are a glaring example of this. <br/><br/>
This opinion piece sounds like you're at it again, and this time, Congress smells desperate and petty. This article would have made sense if Congress had been efficient with government's money. We all know that government's reports are inflated and required money reported always include large buffers for corruption. While you try to raise the point of reduction in budgets, I am seeing this as a step towards efficiency and reduced corruption. If this is true or not, public wont know anyway given Modi's hold on media, but your attempt to raise doubts in public's mind about Modi's decision has back fired on you. All the numbers and schemes that you have quoted smell of 2 things - <br/>
1) Your attempt to show to public that you were involved in Ministry's work<br/>
2) Your attempt to go hammer and tongs with statistics to highlight current government's misdeeds. In my opinion, we are okay with poor efficiency and decision thanks you the UPA government anyway, your attempt to highlight these of the current government couldnt make me care less. Like we believed the UPA when they said that these processes take time, we are willing to believe he same for the current government as well.<br/><br/>
If anything, this was a desperate and half hearted opinion you have written, which only disappoints me, given your stellar education record - MA, MALD, PHD and Honorary Doctor of Letters. We eternally hope for a more pragmatic government who spends time and effort in doing things, rather than making noise about the neighbour's faults. <br/><br/>
This also makes me marvel at the irony - if we are to expect such decisions, opinions and behaviors from highly educated people like you, what use is all this education anyway?

                            He is just talking in his own Congress's way. The issue is not about allocation but about allocation. The figure shown by Shashi talks about allocation made by UPA and he is forgetting to   spill out the expenditure out of the allocation. It was not even 50% of the money allotted. It shows UPA was showing the numbers on paper only.

                            Indian education ? Is there anything called Indian education ? Isn't it just a copy past of western education ? It's been happening for last 6 decades and still happening. And if someone is trying to change that you are opposing them ? There is nothing wrong in teaching Indian values and culture in India. Mr Tahoor your monarchy party's education policy has resulted in many generation of Indians being bought up thinking speaking English is being educated .. If you can't speak English you are illiterate and uneducated. Speaking English in India is a fashion and social status rather than a necessity to communicate with those who can only communicate in English. Indians keep muttering unnecessarily in English even they can speak a common local language. We think that western world likes us of being able to communicate in English ? That's a myth .. I have lived in west for many years and have seen ppl here laughing on us and our English accent .. Indian speaking English is in a same boat as a Chinese not speaking English as they don't understand our hinglish. Your 60 years rule has made India a fools paradise and a low quality cheap labour call center hub what most westerners hate. I would Rather be myself and be proud of Indian culture and values than trying to copy west. If someone has saved our cuture, values and languages ..they are local regional parties .. Your party is a creation of British .. To make India like west ... Jai hind !

                            The rot in the education is very deep set from primary to PG level. Now the Cong wants the present Govt to clean then within a few short months! Over all these years there has been an exodus to the West of students seeking quality higher education. Mr Tharoor knows this very well. He is an extremely smart man. (Incidentally, if people like him were at the top in the Cong, the INC would have no problems in winning the electoral battle.) It is so obvious that the assault against the govt is being orchestrated by a management team to prepare them for the next elections. Its a pity that they cannot serve as a constructive opposition and give us a bit of peace of mind without these daily false battles. Let the present govt do its job. Improve the situation a bit, and then if the INC wins in the next round, reap the benefits of it!! <br/>
This daily hit back at the govt post RaGa V 2.0 is now getting irritating. and it may just backfire!

                            To find out what is wrong with the Indian education system, one need do no more that look at the present day Congress stalwarts.  Take Jyotiraditya Scindia and Mani Shankar Aiyar as examples.  Both were educated at Doon School, and you do not get more elite than Doon!  Mani went on to St Stephens and Cambridge.  Scindia went on to Harvard and Stanford.  Where do these two Congress stalwarts end up?  Mani has made a career out of being the most well known sycophant to a dynasty that has as its present day matriarch, Sonia Gandhi who did not even complete her school education!  Scindia ends up being the domo major of Rahul Gandhi who is universally derided as a Pappu.  Tharoor himself has fared no better; St Stephens followed by a PhD from Tufts University in USA at the age of 22, and, having previously derided the Gandhi parivar is now an ardent fan.  If the top institutions of India produce such servile, sycophantic morons, then those of us who do not subscribe to the view that the Gandhis are destined to rule India by virtue of their birth, have every right to try new systems and new procedures.  Our objective is to turn out people with more self-respect, people not accepting of the exclusion of all save the Gandhis to the highest office of the land, people with a sense of dignity who abhor grovelling at the feet of an Italian waitress.  Tharoor may well regard the various statistics reeled out by his research assistant as indicative of the doom that will engulf India.  Those of us who have a lot more dignity will work on the premise that what we are embarking on is the first stage of ridding India of the slave mentality that Tharoor, Aiyar and Scindia wish to inculcate into us.

Cong govt only allocated budgets but were meant for scams. Our and YOUR too PM MODIJI, is addressing problems at a grass root level with a mindset change, create jobs so educated and uneducated both can have a better life. Yes, this will not happen overnight. Also, just education alone is not enough and is not guaranteed to be a good citizens to service and secure our nation. Being educated is subjective , it's not just getting Phd, but commit to the nation to service. It's not  just write articles and throw stones from the fence -you urself are educated, but not good for nation, so is Mani Iyer.

                            Mr Tharoor, ur analysis is flimsy. It does not take rocket science to understand that with growing population, more schools, teachers are reqd. Many gov't committees have wasted resources to understand this simple axiom. Chidambaram intro cesses (basically excesses) and mopped up huge cash which are "allotted" to states who eat them and release only farts. Pvt sector has moved into this space bcoz of PROFIT opportunity. All politicos own schools, colleges and make HAY. If U seriously want good teachers ensure following a) No transfers unnecessarily b) Teachers salary directly into account rather than thru govt dept. c) Abolish the uuseless education dept d) Seriously look into the common inputs given to children like integrity, truth etc ( Even U can check this out) e) Remove the control on teachers by the education dept.   and many more. C,mon bugger, do something useful for a change. Sibal lost a golden opportunity bcoz he did not have the brains or the caliber. U hhave both. Rahul can look after himself, but since u have written on a very statesmanlike issue, u have to live up to the expectations raised. Develop ur vision on this. Future generations will put up ur statues.

                            It is not the amount of money but how you spend it that counts. Each government decides on which sectors it wants to concentrate, and again within each sector how the money is to be allocated. The Congress had 60 years in which they made a mess of everything including education. Tharoor should have advised then and not now when his party is out of power and unlikely to return. The BJP is unlikely to take advice from the Congress. The Congress got booted out for corruption and following wrong policies. Hardly an inspiring example.

                            BJP is not out serious about education. Its all talk and no action. They announce any number of IITs but allocate no funds for it. Just hanging a board in front of a building does not make it an IIT. As for autonomy, he ha ha, the UPA was no better, Sibil tried to cancel the IIT entrance exam, the JEE (joint entrance exam) one of the most fairly conducted exams in the world. Luckily professors like Dheeraj and Sanjeev Sanghi filed a case against him and stood their ground. Else today IIT would have become an institution without any entrance exams, where only people with influence like the neta's sons could have got in. As it is Sibal has introduced 20 percentile and all kinds of nonsense in the admission procedure. Shashi Tharor knows the whole story but has to defend the congress for survival.

Their (Modi Govt.) first year record is miserable despite low oil prices resulting Modi with 16 foreign trips in which he mostly criticized India's last 60 years of achievements. This is what RSS wants. Our Schools/ colleges and higher education centers have become RSS Shakhas.  BJP so vulnerable of loosing elections, winning majority with 31% votes (whereas Congress used to win with 42% of votes), they are communalizing India with coating of development propaganda. They want to keep congress at bay, they want more polarization favoring BJP,recent Bandra Easr by-elections is an example, where MIM pulled 15000 votes, leaving an easy victory for their ally candidate, otherwise it would have been a very closed fight. The same is true in UP, Bihar and other states. Congress needs to revived to maintain peace and harmony as well as development, which media least highlighted in past 10 years.

You gud purported a plot that results in sky high rise in tuition fee across IIM and IIT .,, Mr Tharoor , do u have any logical explanation for such a massive rise of fee by IIM ? On what ground iim are charging 15 to 20 lakh rupees for education ? Is their any public accountability ? If IIM charges 18 lakh for just 300 classes per students , it mean they are charging roughly 6000 rupees per student per day ...is not this a big corruption bloody ? Private schools in delhi are charging 10000 rupees per student per month at least they are way better despite they too are looting and sucking the blood of innocent people . I just pray to God that all corrupt leaders of India should get brutalist disease so that they will die with worst pain

In US,education is state &amp; local issue, and most kids attend public schools,which are completely free (tax funded, Here all tax money goes to tax heavens). But here in India Mr. Tharoor advocates central govt controlling education from Delhi!! creating KVs, Navodaya,IITs,IIMs,etc, India too union of states like USA &amp; we are more diverse than US. Why central govt should bother about education, set up schools,collages,etc. instead of focusing on issued of India like defense, foreign affairs, etc? Education was state subject till 1980s but suddenly centre want to control all states though we have state &amp; local govt. Our education cess was supposed to fund creating new state govt schools and provide quality education. But central govt creating a unthinkable system, eroding quality of education and culture since central education means imposition of Hindi(which is nothing but Urdu).

By reducing the allocation of resources to the Institutes at various levels, the Modi government is surely tolling the death knell of our education.<br/>
The future of our country lies in the youth and their education and upliftment.<br/>
But the government seems to look the other way wishing that somehow things will fix themselves up.<br/>
What has the Modi govt. to say about this problem?<br/>
When countries like Japan and China are pushing up the amount they are spending on education, we are just reducing the expenditure on it. We will surely  pay for our short-sightedness in the long run.

                            Besides the investment required in education - schools and universities, infrastructure, co-curricular activities, teaching - it is essential that scientific temper is cultivated. Claiming knowledge of plastic  surgery to explain Ganesha's elephant head and claiming that we had aircraft several thousand years ago is an avoidable hinderance.

                            So far as autonomy of education is concerned,it was there and is still there.The Government and education are supplementary to each other.Government's advice to universities in matters related to VCs and other higher authorities cannot be considered an interference.Government has a wide pool of talent within its resources and access.It acts as a feeder to educational network,and does not run contrary to it since ultimately it is the literati which has to manage education.

                            (i) Although it is important to see that money is spent properly, with increased inflation and significantly decreased funding, it is difficult for the institutions to perform well. Mr Tharoor, in my opinion, is at least partly correct. What emphasis did the Finance ministry give to the education (and health) in the current budget?<br/>
(ii) From what the ministry is currently doing and by looking at the appointments it has made [within itself (MHRD!), BHU and ICHR] as well as its meddling in IITs and other higher educational institutions, I think that there will be irreparable and adverse effect on education system. <br/>
(iii) Reservation for the unprivileged class is important. But unless there is a rider (for a minimum performance level), it is not going to succeed well. This is where UPA Govt has erred, in my opinion. This provision has been used/misused by both the UPA and NDA Govts only to garner votes. I hope that in the future, this will be addressed appropriately by those in power.
