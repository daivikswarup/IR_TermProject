Headline::::The Sordid Reality of Marital Rape



DateTime::::2015-05-04T04:24:00+05:30




                                Hearing this was most painful.."My husband raped me daily. He forced himself on me, every single day, even on the days I bled. He did not spare me all through the pregnancy and even till the last day of delivery of my child ... I want no woman to lose time to speak up against such an atrocity. Speak out early, so that you do not continue to suffer as I did. I was scared of him all along."....Now I am strong to reject such a man." (A woman on a TV program)
"Is a wife merely body parts?" I ask.
What compels a wife to continue living with her husband who is a sex-maniac? What kind of man commits such atrocious acts on his wife, almost daily? Why does he treat the mother of his own children in such an inhuman way? How does he get away with this brutality? Is it because marital rape is not a criminal offence, compared to one committed on an outsider? Is he abusing this distinction? Is marriage for such depraved men a license to rape because of the 'implied consent' which comes with wedlock?We had a rather insensitive statement from Minister of State for Home Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary in the Rajya Sabha on April 29, 2015. I quote:
"It is considered that the concept of marital rape, as understood internationally, cannot be suitably applied in the Indian context due to various factors, including level of education, illiteracy, poverty, myriad social customs, and values, religious beliefs, mind-set of the society, to treat marriage as sacrosanct."
It is this statement which has stirred the latest debate on marital rape. And legal luminaries and social activists are expressing strong arguments for a change.
Wonder on basic tenets of common sense, how does a cruel marriage remain sacred? What is sacrosanct about it?
Unreported marital rape is a sordid reality of millions of women in our country as surveys conducted by the UN and other agencies reveal. Men themselves too are confirming the results. It's as high as 75% women subjected to marital rape at some point or the other. Not to forget millions of girls in our country are married off at a young age.
Victims continue to suffer for several reasons, dependent on their socio-economic-psychological situation.
Bertrand Russell in his book Marriage and Morals wrote "Marriage for a woman is the commonest mode of livelihood, and the total amount of undesired sex endured by women is probably greater than in prostitution."  
In December 1993, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights published the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women and declared marital rape as a human rights violation.
Similarly, the Council of Europe Convention, in force since 2014 August, declared non-consensual sexual acts committed against a spouse or partner as illegal. This convention is legally binding in Europe. Other countries where marital rape is illegal include the US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Sweden, Russia, Poland and many more.
In India, marital rape can come under cruelty clauses of section 498A of Indian Penal Code. Cruelty, though not specifically defined, covers physical and mental harassment. Punishment is maximum three years with fine.
Another section of law, 375 IPC defines rape, but says it is not rape if it is intercourse between husband and wife, and when such wife is not younger than 15.
Very few women include sexual assaults/cruelty in their complaints to police, courts or family counselling centres. Information about this is deficient in the public domain.
Under the Domestic Violence Act of 2005, sexual violence is a non-criminal violation. On a complaint received from an aggrieved wife, the Court can call the husband to hear him. Once heard, (lawyers not mandatory), the case is usually referred to a mediator for resolution, if possible. If the complaint is found correct, and mediation fails, the Court can pass a Protection Order directing the man to correct his conduct. The direction of the Court is legally binding. On violation of the direction, the wife can go back to the Court to complain. Violation of the Protection Order can call for short imprisonment. Police help can be taken. However, the process remains a protracted civil matter between the victim, the accused and the Court.
This is functional to an extent. But not effective in practice, as has been seen and reported - in part because of long queues and infrastructure inadequacies. Also, if mediation does not work, the victim has to fall back on herself or family support.
In Washington State laws on marital rape, there are heavy financial penalties imposed in cases where marital rape is established.
One of my Foundations has been running family counselling centres for the last 25 years. Its records show that once the woman acquires the courage to complain, she does not go back to endure cruelty.
But she wants to see her husband punished, and finds no avenue for that. Instead it is she who struggles and suffers most if she has children, no financial resources and is without family support. The IPC sections of cruelty take years in trial. In view of this, victims remain victims. They either give in, or give up.
One thing is evident - that in cases of sexual violence in marriage, the woman is a victim. If a marriage is still continuing, it is because she is submitting to it, she is weak, poor, and afraid, has children, is dependent, roofless, and reconciled to fate. She is also often ignorant of the legal help available.  
One wonders what kind of children does such a woman in distress give birth to and nurture. What kind of home environment will these children grow up in? What kind of fathers do such men make? And will the victimised mother welcome a girl child who may grow up to suffer the way she has? Can such a mind-set be ruled out? I have seen this prevailing with its serious social implications, contributing to the imbalance in gender.  
The need of the times is to considerably transform our humankind, their values and education - this is real long-term prevention and correction. It begins with every home, every school.
We need to educate our boys and girls differently and equally at the same time. The criminal justice system can effectively serve as a deterrent only if the law breakers are a small percentage, but not if the crime is an un-reported 75%. This is an epidemic.
Hence, Indian society needs comprehensive socio-cultural-legal solutions to this prevailing unstated cruelty if it wants healthy children from happy parents in caring homes. In the West such changes came post the 1970s. When will we introduce them?
Till then, political leaders must realise that there is nothing sacred in an exploitative marriage. They must stop making regressive statements.(Kiran Bedi is the first woman to have joined officer ranks of Indian Police Service. Recipient of Magsaysay Award (1994) for police and prison reforms, she has also worked as a UN police advisor. A tennis champion, she earned a PhD from IIT Delhi and is a Nehru Fellow. She's founded many NGOs and is the author of several books.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

What they are thinking only MAN are born to rape and do criminal activity.. Every thing we can not protect by law.. Other side of marraing is Faith..  if there is no faith on each other then we should discard the relationship..and we have law for that...

                            True, she is right. We donot have any sacredness in marriage today when the women are already taking benefit of the laws against men/in-laws in most ofthe cases (~90%) and are spoiling the careers of their husbands/other men, reputation of their in-laws and even spoiling their married lives and later wanting the in-laws to either accept them again or pay hefty sums so that they have atleast money to survive. We already have many provisions like 498a, DV Act where a women can take action against such inhuman males if any, but giving another power over and above what is already more than necessary and harming the society is another big mistake being asked for. REMEMBER WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY. IF YOU ARE DESIRING SUCH LAW WHICH WILL BE BASED ON ONLY THE WOMEN SAYING AS THESE ARE PRIVATE AFFAIRS, THE PUNISHMENT FOR THE FALSE AND ERRING COMPLAINTS SHOULD BE VERY HIGH SO AS NOT TO PROVIDE POWER WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY.

                            I wholly AGREE! There should be law to protect the rights of the suffering women. However, its a complex issue that needs to be thoroughly researched before any such law is implemented. I also believe take the other side of the argument. There should be a heavy penalty for misuse!!

                            Dear Ms Bedi,<br/><br/>
I have been married for the last 6 years ans have two kids. Am facing a finanial difficulty in life coz i chose to quit my job and start a local business to be with my ageing and sick father. Since, that day my wife has turned heel and made my life hell. She has now started making allegations of how me and my family have always tortured her. She blames me for having spoilt the future of my kids who are only 4 and 2 years old respectively.She abuses me and my parents and all our relatives in the filthiest of language possible. She walked out of my house and then filed a maintenence case on me under Sec 125 crpc alleging that me and my family tortured her for dowry. When she saw the case going nowhere, she opted for a comporomise in the court and came back. Now her behaviour is even worse. A guy who was good enough to earn a package of 11 lacs annually - me, i've lost motivation in life and dunno wht to do with such lady. When i try to counsel her, she blames my parents for everything, she abuses and curses us all in the filthiest way possible and challenges me tht she'll put me and my parents behind bars unde 498A or DV Act and its only coz of the two kids that she's sparing us all.<br/><br/>
Stop putting up hypothetical examples and make scapegoats out of men. Yes, some men are cruel but it doesnt make all of them alike. There are equal or maybe higher number of women who are cruel to their husbands and in laws. Before, providing for such a law, kindly also ensure that such laws r not misused by scorned, headless women. Its a sincere request from a suffering husband.

                            We need better enforcement of laws, not more laws. As it stands today, the judiciary is incapable of delivering justice to the people. <br/>
But society can take this issue up, to change things from within rather than relying on governments and governmental institution. <br/>
They are because of us, not the other way round. <br/><br/>
The basic tenet of the law must be to protect the innocent first, rather than exact collective revenge on culprits. And our gender laws are pretty awful in that regard: for the victims and for the accused.

                            Its a little weird to believe that you care about the autocracies against women, especially when you use everything in your dispense for political mileage, afterall you switched parties at a blink of an eye, drifting to any side where it benefits you.

                            Unfortunately our police stations are equally frightening a place for woman to go and report and our society looks at a person as victim and may further victimize. If there is a way to define marital rape different from sex with a bit of coaxing and persuasion, laws may be suitably amended. Till then may be the activity can be brought under domestic violence or ill-treatment. Care should be taken to avoid misuse.

                            I am still ambivalent about the idea ofnmarital rape being included as a separate offence. The question is does the woman have legal rememdy under IPC in case of non consensual sex at the moment. Would adding a separate clause help in reducing this evil. Should we simply ape west in trying to bring reforms in Indian society and has it been effective so far. Would this clause not be used by every disgruntled wife to label the husband as a rapist and destroy his entire life. Though it is very important to punish husbands who indulge in marital rapes, but is it the only way or can we have more innovative solutions. There is a difference between a contract in west vs sacrament in India. What we need is an informed debate and not an imposition of the Western liberal concepts of feminism.

                            In such laws, please don't allow any side to demand for big amount of compensations. It causes greed for some people and they frame wrong charges against innocent one. We agree that in our country still most of the people are mentally sick and see women as non-human. But we have to ensure that the laws to prevent such occurrences should not create trouble for innocents.

                            Madam,we're a very big hypocrite country. We have been following the patriarchal system without any changes all this time and hence we see sudden issues like Marital Rape,Rape etc. rise up at a drastic rate. Women empowerment is a very new concept and that too is blown out of proportion in so many times and situations. India indeed needs to work on its framework on laws by making the judiciary realise that we can't see such instances being simply penned in journals and newspapers and that we as a country should protect our women from such disrespectful and heinous crimes.

                            I think a society has both good and bad. Problem with media is they report too much bad. In the case that Bedi mentions i think it is just one mans thinking. We need to educate the man about women importance and their independence.<br/><br/>
There are many men who respect their wives and give enough freedom. We have a large uneducated population who has to be trained not just in life skills but also human values. <br/><br/>
Hindu marriage act has provisions which can deal with such instances and the women is free to take action against such perverts. The problem here is the society around her which puts immense pressure and we need to train the society. Who takes care of that?

                            Agreed martial rape should come under the ambit of rape in general, however adequate safegaurds should also be provided that it is not used by one partner to torment the other other. Like the judgement given earlier, no consummation amounts to mental trauma and can be a reason for divorce and there should be compensation on case by case basis. It should not end up like the dowry law where there have been cases where n the guys family has been taken for a ride

I have a doubt regarding this. Even if a law is passed by the parliament criminalising marital rape, isn't there a possibility that this can be misused by women ? I am making a reference towards the misuse of section 498A of the Indian Penal Code in the case of Avnish Kumar vs State of Bihar.

                            Not sure where that 75% figure being quoted has come from. But last year a report published in a respected India daily quoted a study conducted by The International Centre for Women (ICRW) and United Nations Population Fund's (UNPFA) which came up with a much lower figure of approximately 30-18% (30% for male respondents and 18% for female respondents). I hope people are not fudging statistics. Also what about possible misuse of the law. Media does not highlight the plight of men who have been victims of 498a abuse, so many of them have even committed suicide.

                            Rape, whether outside a marriage or within it is about expressing domination. The rapist's perspective is 'I can do what I want to; and you cannot do anything to stop me'. Once we understand this, it is not difficult to recognize that a husband can 'rape' his wife.<br/>
The reason why many men are afraid of recognizing this, is because they themselves find it difficult to sense when their wife is acquiescing or actively participating. <br/>
To make it worse, men have been brought up (by their peer group, not by their parents) into believing that if the wife is actively looking forward to sex, then she has a high sex drive and should the husband fail to satisfy her, she would seek satisfaction elsewhere. So the Indian male (wrongly) believes that women will not usually be interested; that women do not like it etc. From the wife's perspective it is damned if you do and damned if you do not. <br/>
Not being sensitive to a 'no' from a wife (like the pregnant lady in Dr. Bedi's column) is the height of insensitivity and would be visible in all other forms of insensitivity such as not ensuring the wife gets enough food (in many Indian homes the men eat first), not seeking her view on how to spend (whatever little time or money is available). So much before a man 'rapes' his wife, he would have displayed all other forms of insensitivity and mental cruelty. <br/>
Therefore this is an issue for the family court - divorce on grounds of mental cruelty is an option that should be exercised well before the cruelty reaches 'marital rape'. <br/>
Without in any way denying the existence or the significance of rape within marriage, I submit that it should be dealt with under family law and not criminal law. <br/>
Also that activists must learn to fight battles harnessing larger coalitions and it is easier to co-opt men in the battle against rape if they do not bring marital rape into the picture. <br/>
Otherwise they would be making the same mistake as the Indian leftist movement. Sheer logic warrants that a country where the poor outnumber the middle class and the rich by 1000:10:1 should be fertile ground for the leftists. Yet they squandered their energy fighting religion and upper caste domination, not recognizing that the poor included both the religious and the upper caste.<br/>
The Scandinavian countries probably have the most pro women laws on rape including marital rape. Perhaps our activist sisters can learn from their incremental approach to social reform through legislation.

                            It is a sorry state of affairs, if there is this 'marital rape', prevalent in India. At the same time, a balanced view as to whether the referred 'marital rape' (as reported through UN surveys) needs the same type of treatment as done in other countries (where in most cases, the marriage is for convenience; same holds good in some elite and most celebrity marriages in India;) especially (i) since marriage is considered sacred in majority of the cases (I am not suggesting that there are no cases of marital-rape and such inhuman acts need to be punished), barring of course the cases, where the rich, to avoid punishment of rape, marry the victim as 'a solution' to the committed crime and such marriages often have the associated marital rape even after the marriage; (ii) since the present systems and laws, if properly implemented, can easily take care of such inhuman persons. The crux of the problem is that the implementation, whether it is marital rape or other crimes like rape / murder etc., and the lethargic legal systems which prolong cases. Even if another law is promulgated for the marital rape, the legal system in India would still be so ineffective, because of the inherent systemic failure. We need a better and faster implementation mechanism. The recent Moga case, where the influential can get away by 'compensating' the victim from the 'state funds' and ensuring that the errant bus service continues, is adequate to show how ineffective the systems are. And as usual, the political parties or the media would grumble for some time and leave it later. There would be no social justice system properly functional, irrespective of how many laws you promulgate (and the maximum advantage of these laws are taken only by the rich and the elite) and unless the media persists with horrific cases till the end.

                            AAP cries hoarse as he is not getting enough media coverage even after becoming the CM. He never condemns his real masters, the congress.

                            Kiran Bedi is big hypocrite, because while probably for making easy money she has written against very serious issue of marital rape, she also remains a prominent leader of Modi led fascistic BJP.<br/>
If Bedi wants to be taken seriously she should not only be resigning from the BJP but also condemning Modi who has not taken any action against his sexist colleagues who have often made most disgraceful statements, which have brought shame to the name of India, because in their stinking rotten opinion women are simply sex machines that can also be used for producing at least four children each.<br/>
How can two faced Bedi have the cheek to write this when her own BJP is refusing to pass laws making marital rape even more serious crime than murder?

                            You Indian men are sick. Women are not your possessions and you are doomed to be remembered in history as a misogynistic, bigoted society. I hope your sisters, mothers and daughters disown you. Your Legal system belongs to the dustbin.
