Headline::::Tharoor Explains His Tweets on Ancient Indian Science



DateTime::::2015-01-05T16:06:00+05:30



(Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 14 books, including, most recently, Pax Indica: India and the World of the 21st Century.)The unseemly controversy over ancient Indian science at the ongoing Indian Science Congress reflects poorly on all the parties involved, including the conference itself, which is now in its 102nd year without ever having discussed the ancient roots of our indisputable national scientific tradition till yesterday.First, it reflects poorly on the traditionalists, who have turned revivalism into a form of revisionism with their outlandish claims of improbable Vedic accomplishments. The victory of Narendra Modi in the general elections this year has propelled a number of true believers of Hindutva into positions of unprecedented influence, including in such forums as the Indian Council for Historical Research, the University Grants Commission, and, it now seems, the programme committee of the Indian Science Congress, which scheduled a talk on "Vedic Aviation Technology" that elicited howls of protest from many delegates. It has also given a licence to unqualified voices who gain in authority from their proximity to power - none more significant than the Prime Minister himself, who suggested in a speech at a hospital, no less, that Lord Ganesha's elephant head on a human body testified to ancient Indians' knowledge of plastic surgery. Such ideas, because they are patently absurd, except in the realm of metaphor, have embarrassed those who advance them, as well as those who cite them in support of broader, but equally unsubstantiated, claims to past scientific advances, from genetic science to cloning and inter-stellar travel. Petty chauvinism is always ugly, but never more so than in the field of science, where knowledge must be uncontaminated by ideology, superstition or irrational pride.But the controversy also discredits the modernists who, in their contempt for such exaggerated and ludicrous claims, also dismiss the more reasonable propositions pointing to genuine Indian accomplishments by the ancients. As I pointed out on Twitter yesterday, it is not necessary to debunk the genuine accomplishments of ancient Indian science in order to mock the laughable assertions of the Hindutva brigade.As I have been repeatedly saying, not everything from the government-sponsored right is necessarily wrong. A BJP government choosing to assert its pride in yoga and Ayurveda, and seeking to promote them internationally, is, to my mind, perfectly acceptable. Not only are these extraordinary accomplishments of our civilization, but they have always been, and should remain, beyond partisan politics. It is only if the BJP promoted them in place of fulfilling its responsibility to provide conventional health care and life-saving modern allopathic medicines to the Indian people, that we need object on policy grounds.Similarly, in asserting that ancient Indians anticipated Pythagoras, Dr Harsh Vardhan was not incorrect and should not have been ridiculed. In fact he could have added Newton, Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo as well, every single one of whom had been beaten to their famous "discoveries" by an unknown and unsung Indian centuries earlier.The Rig Veda asserted that gravitation held the universe together 24 centuries before the apple fell on Newton's head. The Siddhantas are amongst the world's earliest texts on astronomy and mathematics; the Surya Siddhanta, written about 400 A.D., includes a method for finding the times of planetary ascensions and eclipses. The notion of gravitation, or gurutvakarshan, is found in these early texts. Lost Discoveries, by the American writer Dick Teresi, a comprehensive study of the ancient non-Western foundations of modern science, spells it out clearly: "Two hundred years before Pythagoras," writes Teresi, "philosophers in northern India had understood that gravitation held the solar system together, and that therefore the sun, the most massive object, had to be at its centre." Aryabhata was the first human being to explain, in 499 A.D., that the daily rotation of the earth on its axis is what accounted for the daily rising and setting of the sun (his ideas were so far in advance of his time that many later editors of his awe-inspiring "Aryabhatiya" altered the text to save his reputation from what they thought were serious errors). Aryabhata conceived of the elliptical orbits of the planets a thousand years before Kepler, in the West, came to the same conclusion (having assumed, like all Europeans, that planetary orbits were circular rather than elliptical). He even estimated the value of the year at 365 days, six hours, 12 minutes and 30 seconds; in this he was only a few minutes off (the correct figure is just under 365 days and six hours). The translation of the Aryabhatiya into Latin in the 13th Century taught Europeans a great deal; it also revealed to them that an Indian had known things that Europe would only learn of a millennium later.The Vedic civilisation subscribed to the idea of a spherical earth at a time when everyone else, even the Greeks, assumed the earth was flat. By the Fifth Century A.D., Indians had calculated that the age of the earth was 4.3 billion years; as late as the 19th Century, English scientists believed the earth was a hundred million years old, and it is only in the late 20th Century that Western scientists have come to estimate the earth to be about 4.6 billion years old.India invented modern numerals (known to the world as "Arabic" numerals because the West got them from the Arabs, who learned them from us!). It was an Indian who first conceived of the zero, shunya; the concept of nothingness, shunyata, integral to Hindu and Buddhist thinking, simply did not exist in the West. Modern mathematics would have impossible without the zero and the decimal system; just read a string of Roman numbers, which had no zeros, to understand their limitations. Indian mathematicians invented negative numbers as well. The concept of infinite sets of rational numbers was understood by Jain thinkers in the Sixth Century B.C. Our forefathers can take credit for geometry, trigonometry, and calculus; the "Bakhshali manuscript", 70 leaves of bark dating back to the early centuries of the Christian era, reveals fractions, simultaneous equations, quadratic equations, geometric progressions and even calculations of profit and loss, with interest.The Sulba Sutras, composed between 800 and 500 B.C., demonstrate that India had Pythagoras' theorem before the great Greek was born, and a way of getting the square root of 2 correct to five decimal places. (Vedic Indians solved square roots in order to build sacrificial altars of the proper size). The Kerala mathematician Nilakantha wrote sophisticated explanations of the irrationality of "pi" before the West had heard of the concept. The Vedanga Jyotisha, written around 500 B.C., declares: "Like the crest of a peacock, like the gem on the head of a snake, so is mathematics at the head of all knowledge." Our mathematicians were poets too! Indian numbers probably arrived in the Arab world in 773 A.D. with the diplomatic mission sent by the Hindu ruler of Sind to the court of the Caliph al-Mansur. This gave rise to the famous arithmetical text of al-Khwarizmi, written around 820 A.D., which contains a detailed exposition of Indian mathematics, in particular the usefulness of the zero. It was al-Khwarizmi who is credited with the invention of algebra, though he properly credits Indians for it himself.But the point is that, alas, we let this knowledge lapse. We had a glorious past; wallowing in it and debating it now will only saddle us with a contentious and unproductive present. We should take pride in what our forefathers did, but resolve to be inspired by them rather than rest on their laurels. We need to use the past as a springboard, not as a battlefield. Only then can we rise above it to create for ourselves a future worthy of our remarkable past.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Nobody is making any outlandish claims as mentioned by Mr tharoor. If this same article was written by somebody from the 'so called hindutva brigade', all would have called it outlandish. Since it is by 'progresive, modern' tharoor, the pseudo secular leftists will grudgingly keep quiet or blame Tharoor for turning himself into a hindutva vadi. Just to make it balanced and not again get punched by Sonia sycophants, Tharoor is being too harsh on those who have respect for our ancestors and their genuine accomplishments.

                            This information should be preached as this is part of the ancient history of India. But this should not be extrapolated and mixed with the myths about flying chariots and hybrid mammalian anatomy. Instead, modern science should be left alone and allowed to prosper in its own course. The blue print of a developed nation is to promote its health care and research through generous funding and help the poor to come out of their misery.

                            I think the most important paragraph in your last para. We cannot sleep on our laurels. We need to move on and become great (once again). We cannot say our grand father invented plastic surgery and not worry about unavailability of basic healthcare to our citizens (to be fair, our ancestors did practically invent plastic surgery). National Prof. MS Valiathan has authored a text on the "Legacy of Susruta" (as part of his legacies of charaka, vagbhata and susruta). A reading of this text reveals quite a lot of relevant information on medicine. Before 2600 years, Susruta was obviously ahead of his time and Indian medicine obviously ahead of the western counterparts (what was there in Great Britain/Europe/USA 2600 years ago?). As Prof. Valiathan told in one personal meeting, "we have the creative/innovative/successful genes -they are simply not expressing themselves now." :)

Respecting the past glories of our ancestors while adopting the means commensurate with the modern times without exaggeratedly glorifying the 'non-achievements' of earlier times in the face of lack of tangible evidence.

                            Well written.  This is how Mr. Tharoor normally writes. But the vocal bhakts cant see the merit of his writings when it sort of displeases them. I am glad that the Bhakts for once saw the merit in Tharoor's views. The problem of the ridiculous posturing of Hindutva outfits is that it sort of trivializes everything which is so sad. It is a great religion and the Bhakts are making it look like a group of nut cases.

                            Some sanity at last; thank you Dr. Tharoor. While agreeing with your conclusion, may I extend it a bit further by stating two things - one, the ancient civilizations themselves were not competing with each other in these discoveries; and two, similar discoveries only prove that great minds do think alike irrespective of the centuries in between. <br/><br/>
We do look the fool when a few thousand years' head-start later we still take 26 years to build a battleship or a commercial airplane. And the Chinese need to sell us bicycle pumps !!

                            Read about a profound research and a new insight into the Vedic Science and Vedic Civilization which existed 23000 years ago in pre-glacial era so 33000 years ago from the current time. And also in Sankhya's 68 Sutras just by using the numerical axioms brilliantly derives with utter precision and consistency beyond all current discoveries reveals all hidden detectable spectrum in the nature without using any value from outside. It is unchallengable due to its numerical axiom foundation which is a masterstroke by kapillamuni. In all humility to all scholars kindly explore and investigate this jaw-dropping research freely at kapillavastudotcom which is indeed a way to Vasudhaiva Kutumbhakam.

                            Well written by Shashi Tharoor. I'm sure he knows and has read all this being a Brahmin himself! What he writes is all correct and the fact that he falls shy of accepting the fact that An Indian was the first surgeon who had mastered surgery including plastic surgery is because he has to toe his Mughal party lines! He goes on to say that "Alas, we let this knowledge lapse", but I don't agree! We didn't let the knowledge lapse, first the Mohammedans and then the Christian aggressors who came from their nomadic and barbaric backgrounds tried and partially succeeded in destroying our great culture and the knowledge base our ancestors had created! An example is the Wootz steel or the urukku steel which India used to export across the whole world upto the 18th century! This steel making was outlawed by the Imperial British Govt so they could sell their own steel! I know many more instances, but hey, what the heck, many of us have turned illiterates by gaining western education!

Even ancient Egyptian scripts do account for Solar/Lunar phenomenon with a much greater accuracy than Indian vedics. Also Tharoor could have subscript the verses/numbers for anyone to cross check.

                            Only a MacaulayPutra could have written this. What is also perplexing is that the Sangh Parivar vilifies the West of vilifying India! This is nonsense, as it is well known that western thinkers acknowledge the ancient positive contributions of India and Indeed preserve them as Human Heritage not just belonging to one region!!

                            I am sternly opposed to the ideology (if there's any) of the political party Dr Shashi Tharoor belongs to, nevertheless, I cannot resist congratulating him and thanking at the same time, for this remarkable article on the genuine accomplishments in Science and Mathematics of the ancient Vedic civilization of India. Dr Tharoor, by choosing to stand by the truth, has presented a graceful example of bipartisanship. Having said that, I wonder why Dr Tharoor forgot to invoke accomplishments of the ancient India in the fields of metallurgy and chemistry. The pillar of Sarnath bears a testimony to our expertise in metallurgy. Dr Tharoor could have invoked the great Indian metallurgist and chemist Nagarjuna.

                            Tharoor just couldn't refrain from having a dig at Modi and his alleged head transplant theory.  I heard that speech.  Modi was making reference to that transplant by way of allegory, nothing more.  That said, all of us Indians should be proud that we have produced and continue to produce the best brains in the world, Ramanujan being but one (who Tharoor did not mention).  The problem we have is that the custodians of the knowledge gained over centuries still defer to uneducated, non-Indian characters such as Sonia Gandhi.  When Cambridge educated characters such as Mani Shankar Aiyer, Doon School educated characters such as Kamal Nath, US Doctorates such as Tharoor, Harvard educated lawyers such as Sibal, Oxford and Cambridge educated journalists such as Thapar, US educated politicians such as Pilot and Scindia grovel at the feet of an uneducated Italian waitress, then it is fairly obvious that these custodians have made way for India to be taken over by charlatans, fraudsters, rascals and other unworthy characters.  An Indian believer in such fantastic theories as inter-planetary journeys then becomes preferable to the blind obedience paid to a semi-literate Italian waitress who despite claims to the contrary, would not be allowed to even enter a Cambridge University college, let alone study in one!

                            Very nice article by Mr Tharoor. One aspect forgotten by all the elite scientists/modernists is a possibility of regression of what was achieved earlier.<br/>
We are talking of events at least 5000 years ago, with no clear connections/descriptions/evidence to those days. It is very well possible that we had far advanced concepts/inventions/skills some or all of which were lost during events like famine/war etc and lost at least partially due to lack of an adequate documenting system. We might simply be rediscovering what the ancient world already knew (which could possibly explain the rapid growth of science in the span of the past 200 years-like piecing together pieces of a puzzle.<br/>
Only time will confirm or refute-but we should at least have the humility to acknowledge the unknown.

                            I wonder why Mr Tharoor cannot be the candidate from the Congress party for the post of prime minister. His thinking and blogs are modern and enriching. He speaks well and displays intellect. But it is unfortunate that in Congress no one can rise above the dynasty, however capable the person might be.

                            A very well balanced article. Shashi Tharoor seems to be the rare sane voice in the Congress. It is very true that there is too much hype over silly achievement claims by the Hindu brigade, which actually obfuscates the real achievements of our ancient scholars. On the other hand, the so called knowledgeable people, who pooh-pooh everything about ancient science unless it is certified by the West (sometimes, even if it is certified by the West), should realize that scientific thinking is based on things that you have read and understood - if you don't understand, you have absolutely no right to accept or reject it - that's scientific temperament.

                            Tharror should be HRD minister with immediate effect. Please remove illiterate ministers and keep some padhe likhe log at the helm. Since you touched gravity and Newton, wise ( read mindless moronic indian current generation of cattle folk ) , should also know the word gravity itself came out of gurutva ( a Sanskrit term for teacher or central teaching ). God save this low life , corrupt, non thinking , illiterate, moronic, money minded plastic bags who call themselves humans. Amen. Siva , destroy the impure and brahma, create a new world.

                            Normally I just skip reading the articles (like the ones from Mani) and start reading the comments. This time, I started reading the comments and felt something great is in the article. Hats off!. This is an excellent one. NDTV should only publish articles like this instead of posting useless stuffs like Mani shankar Aiyar's.

                            Agree with most of what Shashi is saying, but...<br/><br/>
I read the English translation of Surya Siddhantha, which is credited to Aryabhatta by some scholars. It presents a geo-centric model not a sun-centric model. It has a rather ingenious way of accounting for day and night, but not the rotation of the earth around its axis. It postulates varying orbital volocity of planets but does not postulate eliptical orbits. Arybhatiya may be different, but all that I have read so far does not indicate so. Hence, I am skeptical about the sun-centric model, the axial rotation of the earth and eliptical orbits being proposed by Aryabhatta.<br/><br/>
And yes, it does provide algorithms for calculating the time of eclipses (of Sun and Moon) and conjunction of any pair of planets but based on a fixed-earth, geocentric model with variable orbital velocity of planets. This algorithm has been refined by subsequent Indian astronomers; the last being Parameshwarn Namboodri, whose version - Drigganitha - is still used today for calculating the Indian panchangas. Planetary positions calculated using Drigganitha compare favorable with positions calculated using current western algorithms ("favorably" means "pretty close but not quite")  <br/><br/>
The quality of mathematics in Surya Siddhantha is of an order of complexity that I am unable to comprehend with my knowledge of Engineering mathematics. Hence, no gainsaying the basic point the Shashi is making, but his details may be a bit off.

                            Mr. Tharoor you are a well balanced  minded person, and very knowledgeable one should read whole article it seems, some had jumped to comment just by reading upper two paragraphs. Today it had been a habit for secular to paint what so ever related to Hindus as propaganda  or paint that as communal. There is nothing wrong in glorifying  your past heritage, but a clear line must be drawn b/w mythology  and science,just don't mix it.
