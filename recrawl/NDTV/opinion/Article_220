Headline::::From Malda and Ayodhya, Grave Warnings for 2016



DateTime::::2016-01-14T20:42:00+05:30




                                What better way to divert people's attention from the failures and shortcomings of governments than to use the strategy of communal polarization and a particularly venal brand of identity politics? Over the next year, starting April, there will be important State Assembly elections. Those political forces who have everything to lose from informed debate about government policies, or the lack of them, and everything to gain from the spread of fear, hatred and division are busy in ratcheting up sectarian, harmful politics.
Right now, there are at least two prominent illustrations of the dangerous games that some political parties and leaders are playing.
Take the example of Kaliachak in Malda in West Bengal. As in other parts of the country the protests by Muslims here were against the derogatory and provocative comments made against the Prophet by one Kamlesh Tewari, a member of the Hindutva brigade. However a section of the massive crowd went on a rampage, torching a police station, burning buses and vehicles. Instead of ordering a credible inquiry, the Chief Minister of West Bengal had not a word of condemnation against the violence and, in fact, shielded the criminals involved, by dubbing it as a local issue against the Border Security Force, which was among the mob's targets.
This is not the first time the Chief Minister has tried to minimize issues where it is clear fundamentalists and extremist elements of the minority community are involved. There are also close links between her party and such elements, not just in Bengal but in Bangladesh too, including a Trinamool member of parliament who was reportedly using Sarada scam money to help fund extremist elements across the eastern border.
After the October 2, 2014 bomb blasts in Burdwan, when all evidence pointed to the operation of members of the banned Jamaat-e-Mujahideen (JMB) organization from Bangladesh, Mamata Banerjee chose to accuse RAW of planning the blasts. This bizarre statement, which was seen as a defence of the criminal extremist elements involved, led to an unprecedented response from Bangladesh when the country's Junior Home Minister, Asaduzzaman Khan, told the Telegraph "People of our country have realized that Mamata Banerjee is helping terrorists."
The Trinamool's shameless defense of extremist elements within the minority community has provided just the right pretext that the BJP-RSS combine were looking for to communally polarize the people. In their communalized view, it is not fundamentalists but the entire community which has to be pilloried for the Malda violence. BJP leaders are making blatantly communal statements designed to create communal hatred whereas they have not uttered a word to condemn the statement of Kamlesh Tewari, a member of their extended parivar.
The truth is that both the Trinamool and the BJP need each other, and strengthen each other with their respective sectarian politics. The former protects minority fundamentalist forces with a view to "managing" growing discontent against its government among the minority community who constitute 27 per cent of the electorate. This is in the background of growing resistance of the people of Bengal  across communities to the highly criminalized assaults on democratic and social rights by the ruling regime. The other, the RSS-BJP combine, blatantly communal in its approach, is trying desperately to cash in on people's alienation from the Bengal government by using communal slogans. Such sectarian politics with an eye to the forthcoming State Assembly elections are disastrous for Bengal. Bengal is a state which turned its back on communalism and fundamentalism of all hues and maintained an unblemished secular record for the better part of over three decades under the Left front Government. It is indeed a challenge for the people of Bengal to resist and defeat the dangerous games being played by the ruling parties in Bengal and in the Centre today.
The second illustration which has a much more wide-reaching impact not limited to one State, is the design of the Sangh Parivar to bring mandir politics back to the centre stage.
People have begun to question the Modi government's policies. The claims of development are crashing on the graphs of hard facts - exports down, manufacturing down, few jobs created, increased farmer suicides, lower average rural wages and relentless price rise of essential food commodities. The October 2015 Credit Suisse Report points out that 1 per cent of the richest Indians own 53 per cent of the country's wealth. The Modi government's policies have intensified these inequalities.
The failures have had an electoral fallout. The thrashing in the Bihar elections has been followed by a string of significant reverses in rural local elections, including in its stronghold of Gujarat as well as in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and now in some urban bodies in Maharashtra. The UP elections, considered critical for the BJP, are just a year away.
So what is the strategy? In the eyes of the Sangh Parivar, the managers of the BJP, there can be no better way to divert national attention - when all else fails, turn to Lord Ram and the holy cow. This also fits in well with the RSS goal of a Hindu rashtra.
While the vicious campaign targeting the Muslim community on so-called cow protection continues, orchestrated statements from leaders of the Sangh Parivar and the BJP on the Ayodhya Ram Mandir issue signal a renewed design to build up the Ram Mandir campaign.
The RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat gave the signal on December 3 with his statement that "the temple will be built in my lifetime...a good mix of josh (passion) and hosh (sanity) is needed" (to build the temple). The country is witness to the "josh" unleashed by the Hindutva brigade in the name of the "Ram Mandir" leading to catastrophic results of communal violence, riots, thousands killed; even today, 13 years after the Babri Masjid was destroyed, the country is still paying the price.
But for the RSS, its agenda has always been supreme, not that of the nation. Around the same time as Bhagwat's statement, it was announced that two trucks with stones were unloaded at Ram Sewak Puram, a VHP property in Ayodhya. In early January, this year, a PTI report quoted the President of the Ram Janambhumi Nyas, Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, as having said, "Now the time has come for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Lots of stones have arrived in Ayodhya. We have signals from Modi Government that mandir construction would be done now." The BJP leader Subramanium Swamy had told Zee News a day earlier, "There is a division of labour between the Prime Minister and me. He focuses on governance and I focus on the Ram Mandir." There has been dead silence from official quarters to these atrocious statements, giving rise to the legitimate concern that top leaders at various levels of the ruling regime are part of the plan.
As is known, the Land Titles case is before the Supreme Court. There is a stay against all construction at the "disputed" site. The criminal cases against those leaders involved in the demolition of the Masjid, including LK Advani, Uma Bharati and others is also pending before the Supreme Court. The drumming up of support for the Ram Mandir issue is also to put pressure on the court in these related cases.
Taking all these developments together, 2016 threatens to be a trying one for all those committed to democracy, equality and secularism. The beam of sunshine lies in the growing voices of resistance which combine the struggle for equality and justice in the economic sphere with the rights of all communities to live in harmony and peace in a secular India.(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            The BJP, not being able to fulfill its election promises of bringing heaven on the earth, is resorting to all other tactics to polarize the society on communal lines. The TMC leadership seems to have fallen for the bait without realizing the long term consequences to the society as well as polity. The leadership of the government has kept a studied silence .

                            Construction of Ram Mandir is not an issue of BJP or even RSS. It is the wish of over 100 Crore Hindus of the world, one-sixth of Humanity. Lord Ram represents the very cultural ethos of our nationhood.<br/>
Its comparison with Malda incident represents the ideological bankruptcy of Left, particularly the Karats...

                            It is time that a few statesmen emerge to make people understand and realize that a it is a series of such incidents that are being triggered, like the incendiary comments of Tiwari, Subramanian Sami, Bhagvat, Das et al, designed to bleed India of its tolerance and syncretism to achieve the objective of  a unitary and homogeneous Hindu state of India. In short the strategy seems to a long term one of bleeding India to complete communal polarization  by shoals of such communal incidents rather than big ones like Ayodhya or Godhra .

                            The misrule of decades of CPI government is one of the very causes for the prevalent situation in Bengal. The communist party did not check the influx of minorities from across the border. They came and went as they wished. The concept of "National interests" was torn apart to reap the dividends of electoral victories because of the minority votes. An IPS officer was stabbed in the back on the streets of Kolkata by minority member by no action taken. Why? For votes.<br/><br/>
Now trying to assume moral high ground is one of the pathetic things that CPI can ever think of. You have created a mini Kashmir in the east. Why? For votes.

Now when BJP has taken to the highest level since 1992 you guys are only left to write and cry. It is too late for everyone. They have mastered the strategy.

                            The communists have no sense of humour or Brinda would have been rolling reading her own article. The TMC learnt the art of political violence from the original masters, the CPM. They learnt it so well that in rural Bengal the CPM cadres were butchered wholesale and had no protection when the CPM lost power. Hence now they decry the violent politics of the TMC. It is silly for a virtually defunct party like the CPM which rules tiny Tripura only, and that too because of the charisma of Manik Sarkar and no thanks to the CPM, to pontificate on national issues. The high moral ground belongs to those politicians and parties that have clean hands. The CPM does not qualify in any which way. Vomiting media articles in the name of political analyses is stupid. But that is the only alternative when you are incapable of original thinking.

                            It is Muslims who are responsible for violence and roits in Malda, but TMS, CPM, Congress are blaming BJP for the incident. Also no action is taken against rioters. Since rioters were Muslims and victims were Hindus, no one is protesting against incident, no support for victims, no action against rioters. Secular groups, Media, Artists, Mamata, Rahul, Sonia, Kejriwal and Nitish are all silent. There are not planning to visit Malda. In India, secularism means anti Hindu and tolerance means minority appeasement. Malda is one more wake-up call to Hindus. The game played by Mamata, Rahul, Sonia, Kejriwal, Nitish should be exposed and people of WB should reject them in upcoming assembly polls.

                            Whatever, Tiwari said is his freedom of speech in its true sense however brash and stupid it maybe. Assembling in large numbers to damage public property is not. Those who damaged must pay up for everything. Plain and simple.

                            Brinda - I think you are politically dumb or pretending to be anti BJP and other people who are really doing good job for the country. Look at the bold actions taken by BLP leadership in the past 1.5 years. Have you been a part of any such kind of bold initiative in any of the parties you have been associated with in past? You can just keep crying and keep pointing fingers on others who are doing a good job for the country. This is unfortunate for India to have politicians like you in our system. Have you seen the improvement of image in the international fora for Indians since BJP has come to power? NDTV - you guys should be nationalists first rather than just posting anything on your website that comes to you.

                            The plight of the communist party is deplorable.Instead of talking about classes and working to bring parity in wealth and income over all the classes ,they have resorted to the communal approach. Castes ,religions now form a staple issue of their politics. TMC itself is a communal organisation and it has to be countered with the issues of poverty ,income disparities and security and safety.No other party can compete the communalism of TMC in Bengal ,think out of the box ,go in for issues much needed to be addressed.

You were powerful. For your fear in 1940's, Nawabs funded Pakistan movement. The difference between India and Pakistan today is due to strong communist streak of thoughts. Congratulations.<br/>
Had you delivered more effectively, Ayodhya would have been a forgotten issue by now. But you didn't. <br/>
You didn't arm twist 100% literacy from central government, you didn't enforce tillers' act across all states. You didn't nationalize all religious places. You didn't bring truly (Western sense) secular government.<br/>
You didn't do a lot of things when you could.<br/>
