Headline::::As a Minister, I Removed the Lal Batti



DateTime::::2015-03-04T15:44:00+05:30



(Suresh Kumar is a four-time MLA from Rajajinagar in Bengaluru city)
	This is my 31st year as an elected representative. In 1983, I was first elected as a municipal councillor in Bengaluru - also called Corporator. The day I entered the municipal corporation building a senior leader gave me a pep talk that I must stay always accessible and approachable to the common man.
	Unlike these days, when one can keep in constant touch with voters using mobile phones, emails and social networking sites, we had none of these then except landline telephones. And landline phones were scarce and called expensive. So one had to be available to voters in person and be visible, accessible, earthy and humble.
	I learnt quickly that the best way to achieve all this is to remain one among the common man. It became an article of faith for me all these years.
	I did not land in the municipal corporation as an elected representative just like that. I thank my stars for the unusual education that I received as someone in public life. It was a rare "university education" for me during 1975-77. I am not referring to my B.Sc., or LLB education. The best political education I got was when I was imprisoned for 15 months during the Emergency period under the MISA law.
	 I had the company of illustrious political leaders at the Bangalore Central Prison and had this wonderful opportunity to observe these great men who were role models for an aspiring public servant with their "simple living, high thinking" kind of lifestyle.
	I saw from very close quarters great personalities like Madhu Dandavathe, who later served as Union Railway Minister during the Janata Party government in 1977-79. When he got a call to inform him that he had been chosen for the Union Council of Ministers, he was washing clothes at home.
	I joined the RSS when I was eight years old. I have come across many RSS pracharaks who were highly educated, but had opted for simple living as full time workers with a frugal lifestyle. I grew up amid people to whom simplicity was not a choice, but a fact of life.  
	As a councillor or corporator I was known as "Cycle Suresh" as I regularly used a bicycle in my municipal ward. Many a time, the water board valve man rode pillion on my cycle in the early mornings to attend to water supply problems.
	While I was practising as an advocate, I used my cycle to attend courts. As an MLA in my first two terms, I got promoted to "Scooter Suresh";  I frequented scooter parking stands in the Vidhana Soudha and other government offices.
	When I entered politics, there were a large number of political leaders who were not only a beacon of simplicity and role models, but also had no sense of entitlement. I had to move to government quarters as a minister seven years ago because my mother's house, where I spent most of my life, was too small to meet hundreds of visitors I received every day.
	Even as a Cabinet minister holding the Law & Parliamentary Affairs and Urban Development portfolios in the BJP government, I got the beacon light from my official car removed and never used it in Bengaluru. And I made it a point to always travel economy class whenever I had to fly. Some of my peers ridiculed me, but I could not help that.
	People generally think politicians, as a community, believe they are above other members of civil society. "All are equal, but I am more equal" think political leaders and elected representatives, voted to power by the common man. They somehow turn uncommon once elected.
	Power and arrogance seem to go together. This deadly combination makes a public personality a much detested animal. We come across many incidents about the arrogant behaviour of public representatives at toll booths, theatres, hotels, public events etc.
	Craving for privileged treatment has hurt the image of the Indian politician. In most instances, the followers or chelas demand special treatment for their bosses and, indulge in all kinds of nuisance, attracting public or media attention.
	As the saying goes, "if God wants to destroy a person, he will create a few followers for him. And they will do the needful". But unfortunately everyday our tribe is doing everything to further bolster this image of a politician. One may have thought 24/7 news channels, social media and public activism would change them. But, sadly, it has not.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this blog are the personal opinions of the author.

                            I can vouch for the fact that Shri. Suresh Kumar lived in a small house next to the Bangalore Tumkur railway line near malleswaram railway station. He used to visit his constituents in hospitals or other places when there was a need. One does remember his scooter and his simple style of dressing. Even when there were factional fights within the BJP yeddyurappa always kept the non-corrupt Suresh Kumar by his side hoping people will ignore his corruption. In another article I have related my chance encounter with Suresh Kumar, the minister and being blown away by his simplicity. We certainly need more people like him in politics.

                            I have seen Suresh Kumar from close quarters (I do not know him personally) for the last 25 years and vouch for every single thing that he says. Simplicity has been his hallmark and he stands out as a politician who practices what he preaches. May his tribe increase. As a Minister in Yeddy's government he looked lost, in the company of self serving politicians such as Yeddy, Katta Naidu, R. Ashok etc., who gave the BJP a bad name in Karnataka.

                            Mr Suresh Kumar is a great leader, till date he is the only politician i admire.<br/>
If Amit Shah or Narendra Modi is watching this space, please consider him as next CM candidate in Karnataka.<br/>
All the best Suresh Kumar sir, i can never forget the fact you raised pir concern in vidhana soudha during SM Krishna govt about an issue with our college management and helped us in getting allocated to new colleges through VTU.<br/>
God bless you sir

                            I too have had the fortune of observing Mr. Suresh Kumar through the years. He is an amazing example of a true social worker who took the path of politics to serve his people. God bless him.<br/><br/>
I noticed the comment on Ma Sharada Banerjee .... ha ha ha.... shining indeed.

                            He is a true representative of the people. Hats off to him. The last 3 paras of the article should be made compulsory reading for every politician in this country from municipal councilors to union ministers. If every politician had the principles and practices of Shriman Suresh Kumar, the Indian politician would not be regarded as the low life he is considered to be today. The problem is that politics is no longer considered a service, but a career. And like every career the politician wants it to be a grand financial success, by hook or by crook. Hope he becomes the CM of Karnataka one day. It is not him, but Karnataka that will be enriched. Good luck to him.

                            Suresh is known for his down to earth attitude, very good communicator, good administrator. I doubt if he will ever become the CM as he is not the guy who will demand for a post. The other bullies in the party like Ashok, yedyurappa will make sure he is not made CM..

                            Our CM Mamata Banerjee is a shining example of a person who has consistently shunned the Lal Batti culture , shuns VVIP culture and lives and works out of a humble dwelling in a very middle class lane of Kolkata. Neo imperialism cannot be accepted in circa 2015 and the sooner these depraved individuals who strut around with platoons of policemen get off their high horse the better. Or the common man shall hold him / her by the scruff of his/her collar and bring them down to earth with a resounding thud!!

                            It is the same man , who was accused of site grabbing . What is the use of abandoning red beacon when you are not able to prevent illegal de-notifications carried out in your department seemingly under instructions/overruling recommendations?

                            I am from the neighboring Vijayanagar constituency represented by the most corrupt politician in Bangalore layout krishnappa. <br/>
Sureshkumar of rajajinagar is the most simple hardworking ideal mla for the city.<br/>
Unfortunately he is a brahmin and bjp will never make him cm theyll only make a lingayat like yedyurappa /jagadishshettar or a vokkaliga like sadanandagowda/ ashok as cm.<br/><br/>
caste politics is the bane for india

                            Almost all the Karnataka BJP leaders are tainted and as of now Suresh Kumar is the only hope for BJP in the sate.

                            Once I went Suresh Kumar's  his house in 2007 at  Devaiah Park Malleshwaram Bangalore during Kaveri tribunal award discussions, he offered me to drop to main road in his Bajaj Scooter .He was Rajajinagar MLA .We rarely find such people among politicians  who follow simple living and high thinking.He is good ,honest,and a committed person.But he has to wait for a long time to lead the state in present murky scenario . I wonder he may not get an opportunity too. <br/>

                            Suresh Sir, We respect your simplicity. I had an opportunity to see you as a very common man moving in Ravindra Kalaksetra at a function to honour our great poet GSS. But pl note you can't be blind to the corruption that was ongoing during BSY's tenure. Reddy's, Katta's and few more members of your cabinet colleagues were looting but you were a silent spectator at that time which is not at all acceptable.
