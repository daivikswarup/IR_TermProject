Headline::::Why General VK Singh Must Resign



DateTime::::2015-03-25T14:43:00+05:30




                                
	(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)
	"Not even a king has the right to subordinate the interests of the state to his personal sympathies or antipathies,"  writes one of the greatest diplomats of the last century, Henry Kissinger, in his book, Diplomacy. But modern-day diplomats with no understanding of diplomacy and foreign policy are out to make themselves more important than the national interest. Alas! They are also joined by a few TV anchors who find solutions for foreign policies in two minutes. Unfortunately, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, General V K Singh, joins the gang too. The General found his visiting the Pakistan High Commission was a "disgusting" affair, an affront to his #Duty as a minister.
	VK Singh is guilty of violating the fundamentals of diplomacy. A diplomat never says NO, forget using harsh words with his enemy in public. General VK Singh is no novice, and he can't get away by saying that he is a first-time minister who is learning the ropes. He was the Army chief, who carries the image of an honest soldier, and as somebody who did not shy away from fighting the establishment. In my old incarnation as an editor, I had always admired him. I had interviewed him many times and was always fascinated by his earthiness and a no-nonsense approach, but today, as a student of diplomacy, I must say he has disappointed me no end and he has no right to continue as minister. He is guilty on four counts:1. Our constitution has adopted the Westminster model of governance which works on the basic premise of collective responsibility of the cabinet. V K Singh has not attended the function in Pakistan High Commission in his individual capacity. He was there as the representative of the government of India, as a member of the cabinet. And after coming back from the function, if he finds his going there #disgusting and if he tries to project that he was not willing to go there, but had no option but to visit as a part of his duty, then he has breached the basic rule of the collective responsibility of the cabinet. His tweets are clearly proof that he has violated that golden rule and he has no business to continue as a minster. Either he should be sacked or he should resign.2. He has also shown defiance towards the chair of the Prime Minister. PM Modi had greeted his counterpart Nawaz Sharif on the occasion of Pakistan's Republic Day. The PM did not find anything wrong or disgusting in his goodwill gesture to Pakistan, but his junior minister ,on the other hand, detests having to be present in the Pakistan High Commission. Public defiance of the Prime Minister does not send a right signal to bureaucracy and public at large. This is a clear case of insubordination.3. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, it is incumbent upon him to work for the furtherance of the national interest vis a vis other countries. It's not necessary that he interact with friendly nations only. The biggest challenge a diplomat faces is when he has to negotiate or interact with an enemy/ unfriendly country. Pakistan, all said and done, is an enemy country, and as a diplomat, it is his responsibility to work for the betterment of the relationship between the two hostile nations. His tweets are hostile in nature and will not help build the relationship between the two nations. It shows that either he is not aware of his responsibility as a Foreign Minister, or his insecurities have taken over. Kissinger has very succinctly written - "The public does not in the long run respect leaders who mirrors its own insecurities or see only the symptoms of crisis rather than the long term trends." Mr V K Singh you forgot to see big picture.
	 4. This incident further proves that Modi government has no long-term foreign policy vision vis-a-vis Pakistan. Modi supporters went gaga when he invited Nawaz Sharif for his swearing-in ceremony. But the euphoria was short-lived. His government's decision to scrap secretary-level talks with Pakistan because its envoy had invited Hurriyat leaders for talks in Delhi was too whimsical. The government could have conveyed displeasure in strongest possible words, but scrapping of the talks was an immature decision, and speaks of the fact that government does not have a long-term perspective. The foreign policy of a country can't be the prisoner of a kind of ideology or an old-fashioned mindset in the post-Cold War world.
	 
	Even if Pakistan is the cause for many headaches for India, as a nation we have no alternative but to engage it in some form or the other. The continuous hostility will only bleed India. It's in our interest not to escalate the tension on our borders. Such acts will not help in de-escalation. In this context, I am further reminded of Kissinger - "Napoleon's tragedy was that his ambitions surpassed his capacities." Fortunately or unfortunately, neither Modi is Napoleon nor is VK Singh, despite being a former general.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Dude... Please put your house in order first. Gen V K Singh is an Ex-Army chief, a person who has led one of the largest organisations in the world. He is much more mature than you to take decisions and does not need your advice.

                            Good one Ashutosh. But it is like conch being blown on a deaf.. Modi Government is showing its immaturity and will show more. It won't listen going by the happenings in the last one year.

                            Journalists and Politicians are the only human race who have misconception of knowing everything in this world. Just ask them anything and they have whole idea about it and even told you the root cause and resolution ideas. They always criticize the person who is role to play even they don't know how to play the role. Luckily here we got a combination of both a best cocktail.Enjoy.

                            Any disgruntled media person that too who has joined APP has no moral authority to write on the behaviour of Mr. V.K. Singh who is one of the most decorated officers from armed forces. Whatever he has tweeted is correct word by word and atleast he has dared to speak out his feelings. Diplomacy comes after human feelings and what ever stand he has taken should be respected not only by the govt. in power but atleast persons like Ashutosh who has shown extreme oppurtinism by joining APP.

                            Worst kind of PERSONALITY is ASHUTOSH, when it comes to AAP's sting (they are checking a possibility of alignment), when others do, they are horse-trading.  For the last 02 months, what is been done by AAP when they are only responsible for 1.5cr people, they expect Modi Govt. to change the entire India (1.20 Bil) within one year...Grow Up Dude, we all know your what is your party upton...they gotta SUPER STRONG MANDATE, now they will ensure that Delhiites are been fooled.  See water tariff raised by 10%, Electricity to follow from 15th April, when DERC will announce new tarriffs.  <br/>
No Discussion on SHUNGLU COMMITTE REPORT, which indited Shiela Dixit &amp; her Congress Cronies, No action on Police Reforms, talk of Delhi statehood is in a limbo...worst Kejriwal is playing politics with MCD, he's not letting the Municipals to have their revenue structure in place, SAFAI KARAMCHARIS, not paid for over 02 months now....WHAT MORE SHAME CAN THIS PARTY BROUGHT TO DELHI....made a real mistake by voting him

                            Ashutosh has no moral authority to write about Gen. V.K.Singh who is a highly decorated officer. What is Ashutosh - apart from being an AK sycophant. He chucked up his journalistic career because he saw an opportunity to make it rich and big via the AAP. His decision to join AAP had nothing to do with party ideology, sincerity of purpose or patriotism. He makes out as if he is the only intelligent person on earth, who is all-knowing about everything that happens under the sun, be it about land bill or BJP admitting defeat before Delhi went to the polls or now about Gen. V.K.Singh resigning. The only thing he is good at is creating discord in a party which has shown promise of being different.

                            Sadly, it is a poorly written paper intended more as a political piece. Ashutosh writes that national interest was compromised, I wonder how he came to that conclusion and what was the national interest that was compromised. Pakistan does not need to be molly coddled like they have been over the past 68 years. Our approach needs to be much more forthright without mincing what we feel, as it is you are dealing with their miliatry and not their government which is only a front.As far as "bleeding" India is concerned, the writer may have little or no knowledge what it actually means when compared to the General who has seen that reality first hand over decades, on and off the battleground.

And moreover, India-Pak (Kashmir issue) relation is not as simple as "Removing Fishbone" &amp; issue is solved!!!! You realize this very well.<br/><br/>
1) PMO sending VK Singhji was official and formal proposal.<br/>
2) VK Singhji attending the function was his official duty.<br/>
3) Commenting on that is his personal view and feedback.<br/><br/>
Why do you make an issue of this. <br/>
Even you people post and comment some unwanted and unofficial statements. You resigned????????

If Aap and its spokesman Ashutosh has any morality left than Tomar should resign forthwith<br/>

                            Such an irony that you begin with this quote,' "Not even a king has the right to subordinate the interests of the state to his personal sympathies or antipathies,"  writes one of the greatest diplomats of the last century, Henry Kissinger, in his book, Diplomacy.'. If one reads' Gary Bass's Blood Telegram, it shows how Kissinger and Nixon did just that during the lead up to the 1971 war, lied to the American public, fooled Congress and even the State Department because of their sympathies for Yahya and antipathy for Indira.<br/><br/>

                            The point wise reasons looks like the answers 10th grade kids write for their board exams. Hope you get good marks from the Head Master (you know who!). Heard your house is on fire, go and help put it off first. Dont get into areas you dont have any idea about. Also if you write something, do read the comments that you get. That will help understand what the general public thinks about you.

                            Shame!!!A man with zero stature and contribution to nation like Ashutosh in comparison to any ARMY General of India tries to criticize on strategic issue.Foreign affairs are strategic matters.Govt has to frame views &amp; comments to convey key message to an another country in a best way possible.

                            One of the reasons Lee Kuan Yew listed as why India the world's largest democracy has not done better was  "endless conflicts and wars with Pakistan." The other two were central planning and the caste system.<br/><br/>
I think Gen. Singh is being disingenuous and is trying to play to the gallery. If he really wanted to send a message he could have gone to the evening in a saffron or blue jacket but he chose to don one in Pakistan's colors- Green. A person who is "disgusted" does not make special efforts to dress up to please his hosts.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately Gen. Singh has once again proven to be a "loose cannon"

                            Mr Ashutosh, You must think before putting your foot in mouth. Over half the legislators in India are either claimed lawyers or erstwhile jurnos. Your have learnt the language of realpolitik but your verdict stinks to Aam Aadmi. Learn to respect people in uniform who have grown and lived under tougher act of law than all you guys who made the law.

                            The fourth point in above blog is not true, what do you mean by strongest words, their decision was correct to call off the talk. You seem to be congress part-2 by using strong words instead of strong actions.

                            If you remember there used to be a clown called Digvijay Singh in Congress government, well just the way AAP has taken over the baton from Congress this guy Ashutosh is carrying forward Mr. Diggi's legacy.

                            Ashutoshji. A well thought out and written article. I agree on your findings on MoS. But not on our PM. PM may have also noticed this indiscretion and who knows he may be moving in the direction to drop him. If he does this immediately then it will reflect upon him for having chosen this MoS in the first place. I myself was surprised when he was appointed as MoS as while in his previous office he filed a case against his employer, the GoI - for not a noble cause, of course. With regard to PM, he is doing very well on building Brand India and we should not question him, even if we are unable to support him for political considerations. As a PM and on the foreign policy front he is doing well and there is no doubt it.

                            Ex Army cheif Gen VK Sigh adds honur to any Office he holds .He attended the function as representative of the Government.What is wrong when he shared his personal feelings of disgusting in gathering of traitors and a Government consuls of Pakistan who keeps attacking our soldiers day in and day out<br/>
Any Patriotic Indian would have similar feelings and General Singh headed the second largest army in the world. Diplomatic imperatives cannot change your personal emotions!<br/>
What Ashutosh has written is meaningless verbiage which is essentially Aap style political attack on the Government and makes little sense unless it is to take gullible Delhi voters for further ride<br/>
However it would be better for Aap's political ambition to first put their fragile House in order before throwing stones at others.
