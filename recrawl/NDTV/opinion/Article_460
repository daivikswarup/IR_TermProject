Headline::::Ireland's Cricket Team is Pretty Good. Too Bad We Don't Care



DateTime::::2015-03-17T22:14:00+05:30



Marc-Ivan O'Gorman is an Irish writer and film director  who divides his time between Dublin, Delhi and Los Angeles.
	 
	"Today is Saint Patrick's Day, the national day of Ireland. Monuments across the globe like the Sacre Coeur in Paris, the Empire State building in New York, and the Colosseum in Rome will glow green in honour of the Emerald Isle. In India, who cares? If it comes on the radar at all, it will surely strike one as being faintly ridiculous. That's how we feel about cricket.
	 
	Sure, when we beat the West Indies the other day, it appeared, not with great prominence, on the sports section of our papers. Rather, column inches were largely devoted to reporting the multiple Irish wins at the Cheltenham Races, the likelihood of retaining their 6 Nations Rugby Championship title, and Padraig Harrington hoisting another PGA trophy in Florida. When we subsequently lost to another side (Pakistan) with the audacity to wear Green, few in Ireland noticed.
	You see, we mostly play Gaelic games: vigorous indigenous sports like Hurling, (similar to hockey but the ball is struck into the air) or Gaelic Football, (an apparent cross between soccer and basketball). We've produced one of the greatest soccer players in history, Georgie Best, some of the greatest rugby players, we have the world's greatest golfer, and so on. Despite having a population the size of South Delhi, we are known, to use a boxing term, to punch above our weight (FYI: four Boxing medals in the last Olympics).
	This passion for sports even filters all the way down to the minority interest variety like potholing, croquet or cricket. Apparently, cricket was once popular in Ireland, but that was a long time ago. Our Nobel laureates differed on the game's innate appeal. G.B. Shaw famously remarked that "Cricket is a game played by 22 flannelled fools being watched by 22,000 flannelled fools.", while avid sportsman and French resistance fighter, Samuel Beckett, to quote Wisden, "had two first-class games for Dublin University against Northamptonshire in 1925 and 1926, scoring 35 runs in his four innings..."
	The problem for Irish people is the Imperial overtones of cricket; it has never fully rid itself of the tag of the "garrison game". The unrelenting Englishness of it is all too much to take; the wearing of the whites reminds us of the flag of St. George, the chartered accountancy of the score-keeping smacks of colonial bureaucracy, and the necessity to use absurd terms like googlies, yorkers, zooters, or silly mid-offs can only be explained as some kind Orwellian nu-speak to remove the poetry from our Celtic souls.
	It wasn't merely the requirement to play an English game (one would be hard pressed to find a game they didn't invent), it was the requirement to behave like the English to play it. Lots of strategising, tactical adjustments, and well, standing about. Sometimes for days on end. Should there not be a degree of urgency in a sport? This is why I have difficulty determining if the quote about "long periods of boredom punctuated with moments of extreme terror" refers to modern warfare or test cricket. This may be the nub of the problem. In Ireland, we admire vigour, passion, full-blooded commitment, getting stuck-in, "giving it a lash", "putting them under pressure". Granted, this charging over the hill giving it the full 'Braveheart" while our opponents wait dead-eyed, coolly loading their cannons may have lead to 800 years of oppression. Still and all, this lack of physical contact in the sport just seems a little wishy-washy.
	Obviously, the reality of some gigantic professional cricketer firing a scarlet projectile at your head at 100 miles an hour is very different to the perception of this fey gentility. The difficulty for the Irish public is to draw a distinction between the image of Land-owning Gentry in the 'Big House', the ruling class of Anglo-Irish ascendency, the Raj in the Rain, as it were, and that of cricket's much vaunted tradition epitomized in sepia-toned pictures of curly-tashed toffs, gamboling on the cricket-creases of yesteryear. Essentially, it's Downton Abbey, where you may have noticed, the Irish are the drivers and the English are the drivees.
	We are, as a result, always taken aback by Indians' enthusiasm for the sport. You have kicked the British out, right? You no longer have to pretend to like this Victorian nonsense. You have this extraordinarily rich culture in music, art, literature, science, architecture, food and so on and you actually choose to play cricket? Of course, most Irish people will not have been exposed to the joys of Kabaddi.
	Having said all that, and despite the lack of resources available domestically and support internationally, Ireland have a cracking cricket team. In successive World Cups we've beaten Pakistan, England and the West Indies. We've got the highest ever successful run chase (against England, 2011), that there have only been five 300+ run chases in the competition and we've got three of them and, of course, the fastest century (Kevin O'Brien against, ahem, England). And all of this from an "Associate Member". It seems, to cite Orwell once more, that within the sport, some nations are more equal than others, though surely that's not cricket?  
	The ultimate irony in all of this is that the captain of the English national team is an Irish man, a born and bred Dubliner, by the name of Eoin (pronounced "owe-in", Irish for John) Morgan. Whether, as some joked, Eoin's form had dipped so low he could no longer hold his place on the Irish team and had to settle for playing for our near neighbour, or perhaps, looking at how ignominious his adopted team's departure from the competition has been - he is in fact a fifth columnist, bringing English Cricket down from within, either way.  Happy St. Patrick's Day.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this blog are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Cricket actually started getting popular in India only after 1983, notwithstanding the storylines of movies like Lagaan. It being popular here has almost no correlation with our colonial past, except that we started playing in the 1930s. The generations that were born post 1970s have absolutely no idea or interest in knowing about these English mannerisms you talk about. It's the legacy of players like Kapil Dev, Tendulkar, Kumble, etc. that we worship and not some Englishmen doing their gentleman rhetoric.

                            Mark-Ivan, the Irish connection with cricket and India is far deeper!   India's greatest cricketer of yesteryear, Ranjitsinghi, was a Maharaja and was known as the Jamsahib of Navanagar.  That place is now known as Jamnagar.  The main cricket trophy in India, the Ranji trophy is named after him.  Sadly, Ranji never ever played cricket in India.  Instead, following his retirement from first class cricket in England, Ranji bought an estate in Ireland.  You will be interested to know that when this happened, Ireland had become an independent nation.  Ranji was the first Head of State to visit an Independent Ireland and was given a 21 Gun salute.  So you can tell your friends that your forays into India are really an extension of the relations started by the first Head of State to visit Ireland, an Indian cricketer called Ranji!

                            Nice read. India does not worship cricket because of any affection to the Brits. Hell who even remembers that the game was founded by the English. We like it because we kick ass in this game. Also, having played some baseball in US, I can safely say that cricket requires way more brain and skills compared to baseball which is a dumbed down version of cricket.

                            Bangladesh qualified for only 1 world cup, the one in 1999, before they became a Test team a year later. Probably because of India, Pak and SL support at the ICC.  But the Ireland team has now qualified for 3 WCs and beaten some good teams in all.  Its High Time they play regular ODIs and Tests. Surely they'll do better than Zim and Ban.

                            Indians kicked the British out? Come on.  They asked (begged) for independence from the British in a non-violent way. Britain finally gave them independence. The Americans kicked the British out and declared independence themselves. They don't play cricket.

                            Ireland is a much improved batting unit. Paul string, Potterfield, Ed Joyce are quality bats. Perhaps they need a specialist bowling coach. Ah! You have to be in the streets of Dublin today! Greenish Irish!

                            Reducing the no of teams to 10 will be the most idiotic decision in the history of cricket..ICC needs to take initiative to spreadthis game to other countries..they need to keep more matches for UAE,ZIM,&amp;IRE among themselves and some with the teams that tops the table..AFG has good talent and can be moulded to a real good team...no need to worry abt IRE, they are a good team....if they reduce the teams to mere 10 then days are not far wen cricket will be played only witb joysticks....

                            Haha ha Mr.O'Gorman, your article is a laughing stock at best - really, no pun intended here. Though it appear to have been written on a lighter note and was intended to be a funny, it does deserve some replies.  <br/><br/>
Firstly, if you don't like Cricket because of its 'perceived' Imperial Overtones, the problem is ofcourse with the way you think. Modern Cricket has grown and changed leaps and bounds over the Centuries that it no longer belong to your neighbours (who are now getting worser at it by the day!) and is more shaped and followed elsewhere (think IPL, Big Bash). If you're not convinced, lets take the case of the great religion: Christianity - do the  Christians elsewhere still look at it as a foreign religion founded in Bethlehem, like 10-15 Centuries ago? No, because it has grown leaps and bounds from there and is now revered globally, alright? So stop being silly with such arguments.<br/><br/>
Secondly, you think Irish is already a Cracking team by just beating one or two Full-member teams? Think again matey, if making a couple of 300+ Run chases was what Cricket is all about, then why didn't the O'Briens didn't get a call from IPL? So digest the fact that T20 / 1-day are not just about merely whacking the ball around the park. Not to mention the real show - ever heard of TEST Cricket? You think your pinch-hitting O'Briens and Joyces would stand a chance in that real form of game? No way. But ofcourse, Irish are the most promising of the Associates.<br/><br/>
Also did you realise you're factually wrong to say about that Run-chase itself? It was only highest for World-Cups! There're hundred more successful chases past that score outside the event. Also ofcourse, where did you say you made that run chase? When the event came to India, that too in Bangalore - Batsman's paradise where no help is rendered to Bowlers whatsoever!<br/><br/>
Lastly, you think Cricket is inferior to other Games? In what way sir? Look from a Player's perspective, it certainly requires much more brain and skills than a bunch of other games. Baseball is a mindless whacking game at best and Rugby is more like field Wrestling now requiring no brains whatsoever. But ever tried to outthink your opposition with your field placements and 100mps Bowling speed and tricks, not to mention about the Batting Skills to be mastered. <br/><br/>
Ofcourse Cricket don't require the Athleticism of Football but there again, the important point from a Fan's perspective (after all, modern day Sports are much about the Fans (read money) as they are about the Players isn't it): WHICH game do you think provides more MOMENTS of CELEBRATION? If you're luck enough on the day, you can celebrate couple of Goals for your football team (Ofcourse we can go on about the beauty of that tackles, dribbles etc. for hours)? Enter Cricket, you stand to celebrate a flurry of 4's, 6's or a spirited Batting effort when your team Bats, and when they Bowl, ofcourse you go over the moon over the 10 wickets downed and should I mention about the thrill of watching a Chase unfold?<br/><br/>
So if Cricket appears ridiculous to you, you are the sole reason because you don't understand it - After all those Grapes are always sour isn't it :) !

                            I wish this guy's state of mind permits him to appreciate his team  which has been  a very succesful one, and appreciate the game for what it is , rather than focus on belittling it and mocking those who love it. Yes, India loves cricket and so it will be. Why should we dislike the game just because it was introduced by british? We infact derive more pleasure and empty pride in beating the british at what they invented! If Irish had gotten into the top eight he probably would have started liking cricket all of a sudden. He took  all liberty to gloat about Irish accomplishments, but chose to ridicule us for liking the game we're really good at?
