Headline::::India Needs to Stop Obsessing Over IITs



DateTime::::2015-06-25T20:07:00+05:30




                                When people discuss higher education in India, they often talk about what is happening at IITs and IIMs. Once in a while, people talk about NITs or the internal politics of Delhi University. India's barely functional universities are elephants in the room - direly in need reform and rejuvenation, and yet largely missing from public imagination. 
Understandably, Education Minister Smriti Irani has also largely focused on IITs and IIMs within her higher education portfolio. These institutions take in less than 20,000 students a year all put together, and are currently in a shape where they can largely take care of themselves. Even if Education Ministers were to largely let IITs and IIMs cruise on autopilot for the next decade, India will be just about fine. 
Where India desperately needs someone in the cockpit is in rescuing our universities from oblivion and irrelevance. According to the UGC, India has almost 25 million students enrolled in higher education - with an intake of about 5 or 6 million students a year. Those who graduate are far from employable, and most struggle to participate in the modern Indian economy. 
 
While the challenge of overhauling this system is gargantuan, a sizeable start would be to set up 30 top-notch universities across India - with each of them housing 40,000 to 50,000 students. Instead of a focus on ten to twenty thousand engineering graduates from IITs , let's focus instead on quarter of a million graduates from across disciplines. 
There are about five broad things that MHRD will need to enable to rejuvenate the Indian university system. 
First, Indian universities need a management overhaul. Politically-appointed Vice Chancellors have limited mandates and incentives to reform universities. CEOs with budgets and a mandate to revamp varsities are essential. CEO-led teams are needed to improve infrastructure, curriculum and most importantly, create an institutional ethos - even if they have to do it department by department. Some of these efforts are already underway, but need greater articulation and thrust.
Second, India has a pigeonholed education system where engineering students and academia have little to do with the science stream which has little to do with arts and commerce. Harmonizing the streams and providing a common academic system can have scale effects. For example, within a university, one can do away with a separate Physics department that teaches only engineering students, or a separate English department that teaches only Commerce students. Having common departments can aggregate faculty talent, improve teaching quality, allow for a better flow of ideas and provide better career paths for academics. 
Third, India needs to bring high-quality research back into the university system. Over the years, India has set up a few hundred research institutes and labs across the country, such as the CSIR institutions that operate across the country. This has forced the nation's best research far away from the universities and students in general. Academic curricula change slowly - but university teaching faculty need to be exposed to cutting-edge research and be familiar with what is happening at the frontiers of their field. Without knowing what is hot and exciting, how can teachers inspire their students? At the same time, we also want India's top researchers to play a larger role in mentoring undergraduates, PhD students and post-doctoral scientists. While not all good researchers make good teachers, having them share an ecosystem is essential. It is no accident that Harvard and Stanford in the USA and Oxford and Cambridge in the UK are known for both their undergraduate programmes and their research.
Fourth, Indian universities need to attract and hire better faculty - and also inculcate better processes for their appraisal, rewarding performance with financial and other benefits. The academic talent pool is global - and Indian universities need to hire globally in order to be competitive. Most university ranking metrics look at the international nature of students and faculty - they are often a proxy for whether the university system favours talent and ability over other considerations. 
Fifth, there is no reason for the Government of India to be alone in rejuvenating universities. Domestic private actors and international educational institutions must be encouraged to set up full-fledged universities in the country. The government's role here can shift from control over inputs to a monitoring of outcomes, of whether students are learning, and are employable upon graduation. The government also has a role to play in increasing the contestability of university and college options, so that prospective students have a better sense of what they can expect once they enroll. Private higher education in India today suffers from excessive input regulation and insufficient contestability - where educational quality is not always recognized or rewarded.
 
A recent ranking by Times Higher Education of the best universities of BRICS and emerging economies shows three from China, three from Turkey and one each from Brazil, Taiwan, Russia and South Africa in the top 10. If India's education minister prioritises the resuscitation of Indian universities, India could enter that list by 2019.

                            IITs take in a some bright students and make a salesman out of them. What is IITs contribution to india. Does any technical innovation or genuine science research happens there? We would not have been so technically backward if these institutions were worth their hype. A few iitians who are interested in science leave for PhD to usa. We need to restructure them so they can be of use to india. Look at the number of patents that have been filed in Stanford in last few decades and compare with these institutes and you will start figuring out the truth.

                            The 4 year 8 semister format for BA/BSc to me made as B.S/B.A will work wonders to make the basic grduation go a long way and usefull. Its a standard in most part of the world, and basic sciences cannot improve unless this glaring defect is corrected. Yes right time to have the B.S/B.A as a 8 semister 4 years format. will go a long way in making the basic graduation worthwhile and usefull.

                            Absolutely correct. We have become careless about our universities which carry about 90% of total students strength of the country. Ironically most of our politicians are from these universities including ministers, but somehow they are not advised properly to fix the priority of their agenda which favors large population. Research laboratories in varsities are dried up, they are just meant for promotions. We have  to ditch this IIT/IIM obsession.

                            Good one. Also there is a point I hope you missed out. Student who graduate from IIT receive scholarships paid by Govt of India which is people's money. Next most of them who graduate fly out to different countries and serve there for better lifestyle. Few of them are even weird. They study mechanical or aeronautical engineering and startup a ecommerce portals. Hardly anyone of them serves in building nation's engineering capabilities. It's a money and opportunity wasted. Wasted on someone who had no idea why he wanted to be an engineer. He wasted people's money too. About private institutions students waste their father's money in case they choose something else to do, not public money. So we have no issues with that. Finally about the facts on quality of engineering education, yes something big is happening and you will learn it soon.

                            Excellent article though the issue is an old wine  in a new bottle.  For several years, it has been pointed out and severely criticized that the level of higher education  in India has crumbled.  Whereas, IIMs and IITs are overrated in India, policy planners  have been trying to repair the  university education with adhocism.<br/>
  University reforms require  converting 100 universities into smart universities like the government is going to develop 100 smart cities. Then world ranking of the universities will improve, I believe so.

                            Nice post! It's just that IIT ians waste public money and opportunity while students in private institutions waste there father's money. Hence we pin point those hardly 20000 people who study under people's money, serve for a different country or get a mechanical or an aeronautical engineering degree to startup an ecommerce portal or to join a company which is irrelevant to their qualification. We really got a problem with those who hold no gratuity towards their country or towards their education. Next how many IIT'ians get involved in research or development? You know it well. If making money was their sole motive, all 15 lakh engineers should graduate from IIT. <br/>
Finally on quality of education, I agree to your points and something big is coming up, very soon. Every engineering college in India will be an IIT.

                            @: IITs are at Best glorified B.Tech factory and IIMs are at Best Glorified Management Institution and nothing more they do not have sound research base. Most of the Students who enroll in IITs do not become technocrats. These students go to IIMs and then go and join FMCG to sell products that are also smartly sold in retail shop by X pass. Very very few real become Technocrats and they live in USA or Euro. It is time we made a total revamp of the education system and make students who do specialized programmes if they do not continue in that direction should be made to pay the real cost of the programme. I am sure many will find this unpalatable but it is the truth. WE need to start treating teachers and professors with much higher respect and stop politicizing education and making it a business. Large business should set a side maximum amount from their CSR budget for education and help in improving the quality of education.

                            I really appreciate the point about getting research back to the universities. <br/><br/>
Also, a lot of focus is required to bring value of "knowledge" back in the academics - right now we are witnessing exams based on "information". <br/><br/>
It really saddens me when I see that engineering graduates cannot tell me how many 1x1 tiles will be required in a 10x20 room (I am not joking - I ask this to entry level budding software engineers and shockingly 80% cannot answer this).

                            for many centuries and until now, we have harvested the idea of knowledge bestowed in few. <br/>
The perception is flawed without any supporting facts. Its hearsay.  <br/><br/>
To have an innovative and modern economy, we have to liberate the society from cast, colour, religion and corruption (corruption in biased judgement, monetary transactions and obstructionist attitude).<br/><br/><br/>
Our society on the top is filled with those who are myopic greedy and crook.  Its like be a crook to get into the space of decent living. more the crook the better position one gets.<br/>
This society including the top co in india thinks  research is waste of resources; They see the students pursing basic science with disgust.<br/><br/>
Like the bloggers thoughts, i feel the society should focus on critical research. create enough for all. do not think the nest person is better than rest. why not uplift all to a level where we drive the research and economy. <br/><br/>
we have to build team not just one sachin tendulkar.<br/><br/>
Before we bring change dismantle the justice system. its worst in world as they are filled with crooks.

                            The author does not seem to be in touch with reality.  Much much better  articles have been written with more clarity and articulation.  All of them have the suggestions like removal of political appointments etc.  But as long as the real issues are overlooked and ignored, system won't change.  If these things are taken care, every thing else falls into place. Many of the state engineering and medicine entrance examinations have about 10% wrong questions and wrong answer keys.  Forget every thing else and just make the people at the top accountable for these glaring errors, the incompetent people at the top (VCs etc.) will leave their position on their own.  No one makes noise about these things and we accept these as fact of life and move on with live.  What use talking about VC appointments and other things?  It is like do nothing about ghastly crimes and keep saying that the society become a Ramrajya.

                            An utterly rational analysis by the author. However, the solution lies in recognizing the malaise that affects our educational institutions - that of politicization. Although quotas are aggressively managed for entry for both students and faculty (on the face of it, nothing wrong with it), the sinister forces that drive politics in this country have ensured over years that academic performance is ALSO tied with the caste divisions. This has led to incompetency in both faculty capacity to teach and student willingness to study. When universities are supposed to give everyone a first class, when faculty indulge in casteist games (all you need to do is to say that - in case of a forward caste HoD - the HoD denigrated you by the caste name; or pressurize the HoD to dilute norms of teaching, evaluation and publication of results), when students treat it a matter of right to demand good results without studying, how on earth can you expect any excellence in education, and subsequently, in the society?

                            The PM should reshuffle the cabinet, with Smriti Irani as the Foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj as the Home Minister, Rajnath Singh as the Defence Minister and Manohar Parrikar as the HRD minister. As Mr. Parrikar is a product of the IIT, he will very well know what exactly needs to be done to overhaul our education system. The IIT centric secondary education system is more or less stifling the young students as there are career opportunities outside STEM subjects.

                            Must say very well articulated. Limiting the rgulator's role to monitoring the outcomes rather than the inputs is my favourite. It has to start with rejuvinating the managements of the unversities. But the key challenge i how to keep the profit motive secondary to the primary motive of providing quality education to all<br/>
I also think IIM's and IIT's have a role to play in the larger scheme of things. With their capabilities in nurturing quality talent and adminstrative skills this is an area where they should be mentoring the next rung of unverities so similar practices can be embedded in their administrative system. The top rung unis can help the good become better and the better become the best. This is where the govt should be encouraging them to contribute

                            A very highly relevant article. India seems to have got stuck in the past. This is true with education, research, approach to health, infrastructure and our creaking cities. An excellent call for action to save the country from dying under its own weight

                            Govt is too busy in creating new IITs and/or renaming old universities as IITs. Why does it has to be IIT? It can be any XYZ university with good quality education and research.. People and govt need to come out brand oriented thoughts and try to improve and add value to other universities (with their original names) so that they can reach same heights... Every one need to thrive for it, including administrators, faculty and students..

                            Lack of discipline, in general, is the root cause of our universities not being successful. How many students take their studies seriously? Surprisingly, they say that what they study is not relevant to the job! Then why did they join in the course? It is clear that the incentives are elsewhere!! Even the faculty fosters this opinion among the students that the syllabus is only useful to become lecturers and not to get other jobs! The students have not come to study or learn – and this needs to be recognized. As long as we negate this and live under a false impression that they have come to the University to learn or acquire technical skills required for modern jobs, our solutions will be imperfect. Check how many students wilfully abstain from attending classes in top institutes like IIM or IIT, or how many attend some extra classes at odd timings, when such classes are called for. Compare this with the run of the mill universities. <br/><br/>
Now coming to some of your suggestions:<br/>
•	In the land where students use acid to blackmail a fellow girl student, it will be dangerous to have good research institutions and their paraphernalia within the reach of the students. <br/>
•	Having common departments is a narrow construct and shows that the author has not understood the diverse requirements of various professionals. For example, the kind of English which a journalist is required to write is completely different from what is expected in managerial or administrative cadres. The same English teacher who flaunts the knowledge of similies to impress the students with the beauty of her English would be an utter failure in preparing the students to be job ready in most of the organizations now. Similarly, the regressions dealt with in a pure mathematics class would be useless knowledge to management graduates – who need to know only where this technique is useful, how to apply the results and their limitations! Therefore, though the subject is same, the method/orientation in which they are taught in different specialisations has to be different!<br/>
•	In the modern world where the lectures of IITs are available online, it is only the collective attitude of the students that makes a difference rather than the collective academic strength of the faculty. Unfortunately, universities are still in the paradigm where it is the faculty's responsibility to teach. As long as the responsibility of learning is not put on the students, real improvements will not come. We need to go beyond attracting better faculty.<br/>
•	In the larger context of Indian politics, the more backward a state is, the more funds it gets from the Centre. Hence, to remain backward, the universities have to be consistently obstructed from becoming institutions of debate and learning; and made brooding ground for politics. Again, unfortunately, the administration is considered synonymous with academics. Why can't we have administration in the hands of Government but academic freedom among the students!

                            I do agree with Pavan for need to overhaul but there is need to counselling for parent who are so much into IITs and IIMs they even start thinking about this from grade 8. Second part is that in our education system focus is on how to crack the exam and not the understanding of subeject.

                            A classic article. I completely endorse it. I myself a NIT graduate and can say our IIT/IIM are over rated. I have professionally  worked with people from lesser known schools in remote villages producing better results than IITian. Given our size of the population we must implement what has been suggested. We just cannot keep on going creating IIT/IIM. Also, it is not necessary that all Indian talent must come out from IIT/IIM. Truth is it would never be so. There will be people doing much better than IITians and IIMs and goal should be reach and nurture those.

                            In csir labs phd scholars get their first scholarship after one year or more. How could one can imagine the research to go smoothly when all researchers felt harrassed and demoralised due such kind of ill treatment by agencies like ugc or csir.

                            Our Indian "Government" run schools are not fit to classified as even public toilets. Such is the hygienic environment that it will put a sewer to shame. Thats why we must show our children what cleanliness is and how to maintain it. Swatch Bharat is the right initiative but for political drama and any sense of real concern, would have started this at school level and not makin glamorous people with head bands, track suits and white shoes posing with a broom

                            Firstly, universities should be out of Political Control. None of VCs are capable of making any improvements in the existing universities. Privatise them and see how best they will improve? Subsidise the fees for the poor but do not interfere in the management and appointments. And the fact of hiring top class faculties can not be imagined as long as you have the reservation concept where you have a lower cutoff for all the capabilities. In addition to this our so called researchers think that all other students should of their calibre otherwise they are unfit to enter research community. Look at other country doctorates who can even reply to a first standard student's querry and create interest in him to come to research. Above all this, those who get scholarships for doing Phd make them work in India for atleast 5 years after completion or make a policy not to give scholarship if the student goes abroad after two years. Student who really wants to do research in India will be deprived of this facility if these thugs take scholarship for 2-3 years and go abroad after that. Is there some one in government to stop them?

                            Fantastic article Pavan. You have hit the nail on the head when you say that we are obsessed about IITs and IIMs. The problem is that this obsession is across all walks of life - government, media and general public! That needs to change. One of the things that you also need to include in your prescription is that these universities need to be financially self sustainable. Complete reliance on government for funding has what has left most universities where they are. Autonomy - political and financial will go a long way.

                            The issue also lies with employers. Why are employers after IITians and NITians and pay them huge package. Sometimes it is ridiculous to hear, that companies will interview only engineering graduates. The funny part, they would recruit mechanical engineer for a software developer position, but not a MCA graduate from an arts college. The industry too should change a lot.
