Headline::::Dear Sant Claus (of Indian Origin)



DateTime::::2014-12-17T23:08:00+05:30




                                (Shobhaa De is an established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator, who is considered an authority on popular culture.)Are there any doubts about the origin of the person known throughout the world as Santa Claus? If so, kindly refer to our Puranas. Better still, ask scholars like Dinanath Batra or the highly educated HRD Minister Smriti Irani, who had submitted a detailed and learned paper on the subject during her two-week crash course at Yale University.Not only are there specific references to a sage with a snowy beard, clad in a bright red coat in our ancient texts, but if one examines the scriptures closely, it becomes abundantly clear that this gentleman also greeted followers with a sonorous 'Ho Ho Ho' and drove a sled in the Himalayas pulled by fleet-footed deer.Besides, Sant Claus took an annual yatra to the plains during Diwali and gave generous gifts to his devoted bhakts. Children, in particular, loved Sant Claus and waited for him under the village Peepul tree which was decorated with colourful paper buntings.Centuries later, Western copycats decided to steal our idea and claim it as their own. Which is how Santa Claus was born. This is nothing new to us these days. We are discovering for ourselves how the Wicked West continues to claim credit for our original scientific breakthroughs made millions of years ago- like organ transplants and missiles.It is time for all right thinking patriots (oooops! touchy subject), to reclaim what rightfully belongs to us. Pretty much EVERYTHING!Even though I am not a student in a Kendriya Vidyalaya, I am a keen student of our Great Indian Culture. In order to respect the sentiments of our beloved HRD Minister, I am sacrificing a public holiday on 25th December this year, to stay put writing an essay on Shri A.B. Vajpayee - the Grand Old Man who has been sadly neglected by his own political parivaar, but remains a revered neta for millions of his countrymen. I will also attempt two more essays - one, an (un) critical analysis of Madan Mohan Malaviya, and the other on Good Governance (of which there is an abundance, ever since Narendrabhai took charge of the country).Please note: There is no coercion of any kind involved. I am doing this of my own free will, as a proud citizen who realises the significance of "Good Governance Day" and has no problems with the fact that it now co-incides with what is globally identified as X'Mas Day. If only we had had well informed and evolved ministers like Smriti Irani in the past, we would not have wasted our time celebrating a festival called X'Mas... and believing in Santa Claus.I want to thank Smriti Irani for showing me the path and making me acknowledge my grave error. Henceforth, 25th December at our home will be marked by a solemn, satvik celebration of all that is superior and uplifting about our values and culture. No more attending midnight mass at the historic Afghan Church in Colaba or at Mount Mary's Church in Bandra. Forget carol-singing and making merry.We will focus on making the festivities more 'Meri'. Ji haan - there's nothing more inspiring than reclaiming our roots, our hijacked heritage, our stolen icons. Goodbye also to mulled wine and X'Mas pudding. This year, I plan to serve chhaas, dhokla and theplas to friends. The only exchange that will take place will be of ideas, not gifts. Forget parties and dancing, And please! Totally forget hugging and kissing. No more smooching under the misletoe or decorating a X'Mas tree. Jingle bells? No way! Only temple bells. Remember, instead to water the Tulsi in your aangan at midnight and greet one another with a 'namastey'' only. This is our Bharatiya Sanskriti, and don't you dare forget it! Or else....!!!Achcha... but what do I say to my grand children when they ask about Santa? Maybe, I'll just tell them to check with Smriti Irani...Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Yes I agree,<br/><br/>
Let us all sing Christmas Carols and Rock and roll, the shenai and mridungam are humbuk, sounds of archaic tribal noise. The mention of 7 planets in our Vedas by our rishis is pure communal mindset why because they did not get it endorsed by the British queen and gave the planets more westernized names and did not use western instruments like the telescope to discover them. Lets us eat cow, buffalo, pig, rat, snake, cockroach as it more modern and punish all those who eat idli, dosa, roti, subzi, the names itself sound medieval and behenji types. How can a modern india eat behenji type food and dream of modernity.<br/>
Let us make it criminal to follow Ayurveda as it is non-scientific, not a single western dollar of investment as been made to Ayurveda then how can it be considered scientific. Science is what is accepted by the Western world only. Our forefathers were morons to have believed in the Vedas.<br/><br/>
And when my grandchildren ask me about Vedas I will tell them that their forefather were moronic tribals without any logical thought process. Lets bury all the misinformation in the Vedas and just blindly believe in western indoctrinated self styled modern De....

                            Add to the satire: Santa is really Sanatana that could not be pronounced by westerners. To be serious: Take away all holidays from schools except weekly holidays. Avoid using school and colleges for poll stations and public functions (especially for political events) Don't call politicians (especially ministers and such folks) for discussions in TV debates, lest they blabber and public have to swallow their (un)intelligent sayings and retractions.

                            These needless issues only prove that you may come out well in sterile TV debate tamashas but for doing real good at the top level a thorough formal education is usually imperative. <br/>
However it fails my understanding how did the supposedly responsible party the BJP collectively give her this responsibility?

                            I saw you had been specifically very critical about Ms Irani on her educational qualification. There are many so called educated who often talk rubbish, there are many so called illiterate whose words often make sense.You know Sharad Yadav is an engineer, you know Lalu is a post-graduate, you know Akhilesh Yadav is a foreign returned engineer .... Can u sense their qualification when they talk? Ms Irani is responsible for just one ministry, while in UPA regime, Sonia used to take decision on complete governance.Did u ever question what was the qualification of Sonia? no, never.... Bcoz people like u are intellectually slave to these foreign born people, u never questioned role of Church? U never question why Pope refused to meet Dalai Lama two days back? A terrible incident took placei n Peshawar, Pakistan in which terrorists chose to kill innocent kids ? uR SECULAR PEN is silent on this latest development, rather u chose to pick an outdated and unwarranted subject on Smriti Irani to write... Shame on u. I saw u and Smriti, both on TV, I bet if u both happen to debate face to face on any of the topic of YOUR CHOICE, she will tear u apart, she will pulverise your So Called INTELLECTUAL ARROGANCE.U never questioned Communist authors writing History for our textbook in classical Macaulay style, distorting facts, showing our own culture inferior. For u to understand this, u have to come out of ur air conditioned enclosure, go to South India, see the old monuments, go to Humpy, Halebidu, Belur, Madurai, Mahabalipuram, go to Indus Valley sites, go to Bihar and see Nalanda.... See for urself, how rich our own culture and architecture was, if we had been so inferior, why all European powers ( not only British) had to come to India with an eye on its wealth... People like u will never understand this. I urge you, while writing columns, please keep in mind that the readers are not idiots anymore...

If Mr.Vajpayee was in a state to undertstand these, he would have been the first to voice against these acts of vengeance.

                            We should also ask our madam irani if Twitter that she use and used for twitting the Xmas message is mentioned in our Puranas.

                            Good to hear that basically our people are all secular. Though the country has a majority Hindus, no one except the HRD minister and her team are for pro Sanskritization. The great thing with India is only a minority supports Hindutva. The majority is for a free secular India. Soon there will be an end to Sanskritization. Watch and wait.

                            Ms. De should know that Santa Claus is not a Christian tradition in the first place. It was adopted from Sinter Klaas which is a Dutch (Pejoratively called pagan) festival celebrating Odin, a pagan God. In this festival good boys are rewarded and bad boys are punished ( nothing for girls in old patriarchal societies). This festival is still celebrated on the streets of every city of Netherlands in the first week of January. The image of the fat bearded Santa who sings jingle bells,  that we all celebrate and look forward to was an image created by Coca Cola to better market their products and then pushed by several Hollywood films.   Now a lot of us well read people disagree with Dinanath Batra type of re writing of history, but also have reservations about the rewriting of history by Coca Cola or greeting card companies ( as in the case of Valentines day). Ms. De who is a socialite (types who read less and talk more) will not know these facts and hence such flippant articles come from her!<br/><br/>
Importantly, it is important to note that humans invent festivals as we all want to celebrate in communities... There is a lot of emotion in a festival and less religion. If someone wants to start a "work hard day" coinciding with Christmas or Diwali let us encourage that as well... time will tell whether they get adequate traction! ( I suppose not... as there is less money to be made by commercial entities in this concept.. and all us lazy people would rather have a holiday than work!). I hope my comment brings a smile to the faces of the extreme ideologues.

                            Why should a nation go on leave when only 2% of its population is celebrating a festival ? Let the 2% be sanctioned special leave and enjoy their day at home or parties. Let the 98% work. Let the govt offices be open for public. Let the stock exchange be open, which enjoys holidays for diwali, navrartri, gurunanak etc.

Understandably you are Right. As always ! Santa claus ,reindeers, sled in no way belong to India or any way connected to Indian Myhtology. It is sure part of the WEST.<br/><br/>
Sure, Your Grand children be told volumes of WESTern myths inclusive of Santa, why not?<br/><br/>
Let us discard all that is Indian or part of Indian Mythology, for they are  nothing but rubbish. We are born to this very unfortunately.<br/><br/>
Let us never try to understand the VEDAS , discard Ayurveda and yoga.<br/>
AStrology is witch science ,<br/><br/>
BUT<br/><br/>
How do we stop the WEST ?? They are more and more taking to YOGA, Ayurvedic Naturopathic treatments and Meditation techniques....

Get a life doing something real than smooching off the very country that feeds a leech like you. Christmas should be celebrating the life of Jesus and there is nothing you do in your life that even comes close to it.

To be honest that is your problem not the country's , our traditions our religion define who we are , while the whole world celebrates yoga you would never write an article about it, basically you are biased or sorry to say you think of others as fools .. youth of today have every right to know about our ancestors our tradition and then choose what they want ...so please stop being anti-hindu/buddhist./jain/sikh ...

                            our problem is that unless and until west accepts we can not accept anything. our civilisation is very old. further whatever we are telling mythology is not untrue. it is scientific. few days back an MP told that science is nothing in front of the astrology. then vested interests started abusing him. in reality what he told is true. science is nothing infront of astrology. and we are learning many false ideas in the name of science without verifying the fact. example petrol diesel etc is treated as fossil fuel by the modern science though it is not fossil fuel.

                            You need not involved Smriti Irani to tell your grandchildren about Santa. Just tell them Santa is someone who takes pride in not speaking Hindi; who loves wine and pudding; who thinks non-westernised food like Chaas, Dhoklas and Theplas is a joke; who thinks religion and food habit are same; who loves hugging, kissing and smooching; who thinks Vajpayee should die so that good governance day could be celebrated on his death anniversary because Vajpayee's birthday falls on 25th Dec.

                            Next year if Diwali falls on 31st Oct, , I will also not celebrate the festival and simply remember the "Iron Man" and shall not take "Chhutti". And if Parsi new year falls on some birthday of some top notch of Sangh Parvaar, I will expect Smriti Irani to work by observing "etc, etc, Divas" and cancel chhutti of all schools.

                            Last time NDA vis a vis BJP came to power, they started doing type of things what they are doing these days. Result, they were thrown out. This time they are in a hurry. And they feel that chants of Modi Modi will save them. They have lots of foot soldiers now who can stupidly argue to support any action of Modi's Ministers. O.K but if our life gets endangered due to atmosphere of hatred caused with utterances &amp; actions of Sangh Parivaar, a common citizen will teach them a lesson in next election. We want coexistence of all who are citizens of India. The bonhomie between Obama &amp; Modi may be short lived if these stupid actions of his Ministers remain unchecked. So no more bloopers <br/>

                            Celebrating Christmas is a legacy left to us by the British. While I respect the celebration of the festival by our Christian brethren, I am amused to see a whole lot of non-Christians (particularly Hindus) going out of the way to celebrate the festival. In this regard I have two simple questions. How many Christians in India celebrate or observe Deepavali? Is Deepavali declared as a holiday in any country other than India (even the country has a sizeable minority population of Hindus). I must hasten to add that, under no circumstances do I have any respect for Smriti Irani. She has only gone out of the way to make a mess of the HRD ministry.

Don't you know that such small sacrifices have to be made for the glory of a nation? If you have any doubts ask the great Nazis of Germany, or ask the brave soldiers of Taliban. The poems of their greatness bring tears in the eyes of  our RSS leaders. And development, I swear we will see development, once the BJP comes to power in the states, army, education, finance, entertainment, sports, literature, mathematics, statistics and geography, we will see rivers of development. But the rest of us Indians, instead of simply liking Modiji on Facebook, should lend our hand in the development of our country and spend seven years doing yoga in the Himalayas (or is it join the party, I am not sure about the difference, sorry).

                            I think the article stems from the detest of hindutava propaganda where minorities like chrisitians and muslims will be<br/>
bothered under some or the other pretext. if we had holiday on 25 dec for so many years what is biting mr modi<br/>
to change it now so urgently? and we dont have to cling to only vedas or only bible....you moron you need to <br/>
be accepting of all people and cultures...thats good for mankind.let people choose for themselves what they want..<br/>
india is a free country of diverse cultures..that is what you have boasted about so many years right? just dont force people to follow your religion. <br/><br/>
why didnt he cancel holiday for diwali? mr modi needs to shift his focus from religion/culture to economical issues. <br/>
no, we are not making a mountain out of a mole. you are going to hear every other day about atrocities on muslims and <br/>
christians under modi's rule. you wont feel the pinch since you are a hindu and do not have to face any persecution, <br/>
subtle or direct.<br/><br/>
no santa will not get a gift..he is just a folktale just like hanuman or ram or whoever..someone said he was just a <br/>
superman or shaktiman of his time...i feel the same about ram/hanuman...you dont need to hurt sentiments of people of other religions.<br/>
dont be so rigid and force people to believe in your scriptures. <br/><br/>
all indians dont need to convert to chrisitanity. neither do all indians have to convert to hinduism right? tell that to bjp.<br/>
make sure they follow it.<br/><br/>
and that thing about making sanskrit compulsory..how stupid! english is what will help our generation earn their bread<br/>
and butter as that is widely followed in the world. you can make sanskrit optional and encourage your own kids to opt for<br/>
that subject in school if you are so interested.

Let us discard all that is Indian or part of Indian Mythology, for they are  nothing but rubbish. We are born to this very unfortunately.<br/><br/>

                            Very disappointed with Smriti irani. I was quite pleased and hopeful of her appointment as HRD minister. The appointment broke many conventional steriotypes based on gender, backgound, age etc. It looked like we have a young, energetic, female, self made leader from a humble background; May be some qualities like modern thinking, clarity of thoought, maturity and sensibilty are more vital for this role than what she posess. Many old BJP veterans thinking are more modern compared to her. Irani has been a failure so far. We want real reforms, changes and action in education. I hope PM will intefere.

                            In one of the pre election TV debates,had mentioned that she has Army back ground and criticised UPA for not honouring 'One Rank One Pension' (OROP ). I wonder now, if her claim is true,  like her Yale degree ? We the armed forces personnel and families,always respect all relgions and consider national integration as a duty. If Smriti is indeed from Army back ground then she is betraying the 'people's trust' if not, then she should put on 'Orange Sari' (not the designer one she uses now) as that would reflect her rue colours. She is too immature &amp; shallow to be a Cabinet Minister, that too of HRD. Mr Modi is well advised to creat a new ministery known as ' Kesriya Cultural Affairs &amp; Education' and assign her to head the same with half a dozen MOS assiting her (no dearth of such character in the Govt now. We do miss Atal ji - Mr Modi has betrayed the people with false promises and poor governance.

Authors like these who eke out a living on such distorted news that get blown out of proportion would get a shot in the arm to publish such meaningless articles to get some extra bucks for holiday fun. Everyone has their own agenda..not just the govt. So don't cry foul..

                            Was it a mistake to be born on 25th december?Was SHREE ATAL BIHARI VAJPAYEE not a that good person as others like JAWARALAL,INDIRA,RAJIV,SANJAY,AMBEDKAR,MAULANA AZAD etc etc(One must also compare the quality of society and politics prevailing at the respective times).No one was as hard liner when the CONGRESS dealt only in favour of  dalits and muslims and  there were no indians any more to be dealt with that congress belived !!!

                            @Shobba De- This is very sarcastic article. I totally disagree with you. First Vajbyee was not neglected by his partymen, he himself retired from active politics. Second, it is just damn coincidence that Vajbyee's birthday fell on the same day as Xmas.So what can we do? Can we ask him to change his birthday?. Third, even if you are goin to write an essay, entire day is not goin to be wated. Nothing will happen to happen to your trees, gifts, pudings or party or to your soooches, hugs and kisses. Fourth, none asked you to do bhajans, just boserve the good governance and pay respect to great leader.<br/>
In future, whenever you write an article make sure that you write it with true facts. Please don't write about missing your smooches, kisses or hugs that is your personal prolem.

                            Your satire fell flat on its face, Ms. De.  Did you know Ideas can be patented?  If agneaashtra and jwar-baan of the ramayan are seen as ideas used for Napalm and Bio. weapons, what's the beef, Ms. De?  Some people are out to patent Neem! Is that kosher with you?<br/><br/>
Sometimes in being self-deprecating, we give away the farm.  Yes some of the stuff you tried of make fun of are truly despicable, but then it is not all black and white (or night and de). And please, guard your farm - don't give it away.

                            What can be expected from this half-educated minister of India. She herself does not know what class did she complete. It is our ill fortune that this uneducated lady is leading the Education Ministry of India.She is the supreme of all intellectuals, scientists etc.

                            One cannot understand how she can say BJP forgets Vajpayee? Seems the way she is writing is making a mountain out of a mole and only a woman with kind of hysertia will write like that. What is happening to many of these so called elitists? It seems globalization has created a mindset of people who have forgotten ethics, simplicity and values. People have become less tolerant to anything. We find the same thing with our youngsters. We have been exposed to too many things which even most mature of personality will lose control of his inner conscience.

                            You need not involved Smriti Irani to tell your grandchildren about Santa. Just tell them Santa is someone who takes pride in not speaking Hindi; who loves wine and pudding; who thinks non-westernised food like Chaas, Dhoklas and Theplas is a joke; who thinks religion and food habit are same; who loves hugging, kissing and smooching; who thinks Vajpayee should die so that good governance day could be celebrated on his death anniversary because Vajpayee's birthday falls on 25th Dec.

                            Another typical pseudo intellectual drivel from Shobha, fittingly on NDTV too... Why the hell is it important for majority in India to know about christmas and Santa Claus ? Why is that even a worry that our kids will ask about Santa ? If they do, it is because of needless anointing of Christmans as some "secular" festival that all of India should be celebrating by Seculars and their media allies and commercial establishments. Even long vacations during Christmas in India is a british legacy that we should do with soon...
