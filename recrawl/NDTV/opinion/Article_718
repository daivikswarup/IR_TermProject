Headline::::Modi Tried to Solve Pak Alone. And Made a Mess.



DateTime::::2015-07-20T16:37:00+05:30




                                As Ufa turns to Uf-fo, kya musibat hai, the perils of personalized diplomacy come into perspective. Modi is driven by a relentless need to be at the centre of the universe. As the sycophantic title of a recently released book calls it, Modi lives in "Modi's World". In that world, he is the sole conceiver, the sole executor and the sole beneficiary. And so, without any prior preparation, he leaps into summitry, leaving desolation in his wake.
What has happened post-Ufa is the consequence of thinking he can do with no institutional back-up. Summits have to be carefully prepared. Diplomats are the sherpas of summitry. It is they who get together in advance, perhaps several times, to hammer out the framework and fill in the details of what is to be agreed, carefully examining each side's preoccupations and priorities and slowly working out the words and formulations which leave both sides satisfied. They are also careful to leave one or two points undecided, so that their respective chiefs can have the satisfaction of dotting the i's and crossing the t's to claim that it is they who concluded the agreement. But if Prime Ministers forget that they are mere Heads of Government and not anonymous undersecretaries, the result is that their efforts go up in smoke before the ink of their signatures is dry on the issues that have been papered over. Every Queen Bee requires hard-working drones (and I am talking of the apiary, not spy-planes!)
Contrast the fiasco of what has happened between India and Pakistan over the past week with the extraordinary success of the US-Iran nuclear deal concluded in the same week. Neither Barack Obama nor Ayatollah Khomeini was in Vienna. It was their Foreign Ministers who hammered out the complex deal; the political leadership remained at home to handle the domestic political fallout. In stark contrast, at Ufa, Nawaz Sharif and Narendra Modi danced a duet and came home to find the house of cards collapsing around their ears (in Modi's case, even before he, at long last, came home!) In an insightful comment on the US-Iran nuclear deal, Ambassador Chinmaya Gharekhan, the former Prime Minister's special envoy to West Asia, remarked in an article in The Indian Express that "successful diplomacy requires patience, perseverance, clear goals and the political will to offer compromises". Those are words that should be inscribed at the entrance to 7, Race Course Road and over the lintel of the door into the Prime Minister's South Block office. For, if there is any way of succinctly defining "Modi's World" it is by pointing to the total absence of "patience", the glaring lack of "perseverance", the utter failure to spell out "clear goals" and the sheer thoughtlessness with which "political compromises" are suddenly withdrawn and suddenly offered - witness the sudden cancellation of the Foreign Secretaries' talks in August last year and the equally sudden Ufa communique this year.
Relations between the US and Iran are far more fraught than India-Pakistan relations have ever been. Yet, Obama had a clear-headed understanding of his political goals: no getting dragged like Bush (and Carter before him) into a messy and unwinnable war with Iran; at the same time, enforceable guarantees that Iran would not without warning emerge as a nuclear weapon power. The Iranian leadership similarly were clear-headed that they would want to push on with their peaceful nuclear programme without giving up the option to go nuclear at some unspecified date in the future, if required, but immediately needing to get out of the stranglehold of US sanctions. The negotiations were tortured and time-consuming, but the most important lesson for Modi and Sharif to learn is that the negotiations, once embarked upon in earnest, were "uninterrupted and uninterruptible". Deadlines were set and deadlines were overtaken, but, in the final phase, for two relentless months in Vienna, the US Secretary of State and his high-powered team of technical and diplomatic advisers, and a similarly composed Iranian team, painstakingly went over every tiny detail until they could persuade their political masters at home that they had arrived at that fine point beyond which each side stood to lose what it had gained by getting to that fine point. (Mathematicians describe this as the point at which dY/dX equals zero!) 
What is remarkable is that the agreement stands whatever the Ayatollah might think of the "Great Satan" and Obama has warned his Congress (Parliament) of the Presidential veto if they threaten to overthrow the agreement so painstakingly arrived at. That is called "political will". The world can, after years, breathe with relief. At the same time, the US and Iran find themselves together in an unlikely, undeclared alliance to separately face a common enemy in ISIS. The world has been transformed as at no time since the fall of the Berlin Wall. And all because of their exemplary adherence to the Gharekhan formula of "patience, perseverance, clear goals and the political will to effect compromises". Bravo!
In contrast, Modi and Sharif do not even know what are the "outstanding issues" between them since they dare not spell them out. They have narrowly concentrated on "terrorism" without realizing that back in 1997 it had been agreed that instead of each side respectively prioritizing "Kashmir" and "terrorism" to the exclusion of everything else, both subjects would be on the table with neither taking precedence over the other. Both PMs seem to have no understanding of the past when Pakistan had a one-point agenda, Kashmir, and it was India that insisted on all matters being discussed together. India also persuaded Pakistan to accept that whatever is agreed upon be implemented without waiting for everything to be sorted out. And Pakistan, abandoning decades of focusing exclusively on the one issue of Kashmir, agreed to take all issues together and simultaneously. Now, we are back to a uni-focus on one subject. Unsurprisingly, Pakistan, as exemplified by Sartaj Aziz, is back to being uni-focal on Kashmir while we bleat on about terrorism. What a mess. Ufa has undone in one miserable blow, success scored after decades of patient behind-the-scenes diplomatic engagement.
Moreover, two great gains of the Manmohan era have been squandered. One, the under-wraps back-channel which Ambassador Tariq Aziz of Pakistan and Ambassador Satinder Lambah of India used with such telling effect as to even bring us to the brink of agreement on Kashmir with both sides agreed that neither would territory be exchanged nor people. And, second, the blurring of clear lines of demarcation that National Security Advisers deal with - you're right, "national security" - while diplomats deal with "diplomacy". The Foreign Secretary and the entire chain of Foreign Office command has been subordinated to a National Security Adviser, who, whatever his personal qualities, has never been in diplomacy (unless the distinction between spookery and diplomacy is also to be blurred). Foreign policy cannot and should not be handed over to the Indian Police Service. That would be to make a khansama out of a bawarchi. 
It is time Modi got back to tending the domestic hearth and left it to the Minister of External Affairs to do more with diplomacy than getting cosy cronies off the hook in distant foreign lands.(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mr.Mani, you are extremely knowledgable in multiple faculties like foreign relations, commerce , finance, law , history , geography, arts and politics, to name a few. Why don't you use your amazing capabilities to guide the government instead of criticizing it? Forget BJP, did you guide Indira Gandhi to Rajiv Gandhi to Narashimha Rao to MM Singh governments towards the right path? If so, why India is one of the most corrupt , poor , communally divided and polluted countries in the world?

                            Do you ever care about the fact that Modi and his party has been voted to power by the people of India. Do you even care to consider this as a fact. It shows how inconsiderate you are to people's verdict. The reason why we are in a position like this to begin with is because of your master who decided to value power more over millions of people's emotions. If India is not progressing is because of people like you who when in power conveniently decides to not do anything but when in opposition is happy to criticize everything that is being done irrespective of its merit! Really you are one of the most disgraced sons of Mother India.

Tomorrow Mani will demand that the Foreign Minister should be from IFS. That Doval is NSA has nothing to do with IPS. Mr. Iyer do not unnecessarily take on all and sundry. Not everyone in India supports Mr. Modi. But you are provoking different segments to back Modi. Now you have used words like khansama, baburchi after your derisive comments against the Indian Police Service.

All the failures of the UPA in foreign policy can be attributed directly to the political class following the stupid lead given by career diplomats, of whom Aiyer was an honourable member till Rajiv Gandhi offered him a seat. So his views, as usual, are bound to be comical. The elected government is supposed to decide on policies, including foreign. It is Modi, Swaraj and Singh who have to decide policies and goals. The diplomatic cadre have to decide strategy to achieve those goals. Not the other way around. And it is silly to compare US Iran negotiations on sanctions and nuclear issues with India Pakistan talks on border issues. The "two great gains of the Manmohan era" are really ridiculous. Aiyer has truly become senile.

                            Once again Mani is right! In Dhaka, Modi engaged in theatrics and had Mamta to give the impression that the agreements with Bangladesh were broad based. Yet, he loved to bask in the glory of the man who conquered. Modi loves his junkets, especially when there are hundreds of the Indian diaspora, where he can practice his Hindi jibes at the Congress and its leaders. In Ufa, both Modi and Sharif were in a mad rush to show that they were in control and both wanted to show dramatic results. problem with such initiatives with Pakistan is that even before the ink dries, there are Arnab Goswanis on both sides waiting to tear into the agreement as being anti national. Modi has to give more importance to his foreign Minister, restrict his tours to important relationship building and not develop an ad lib foreign policy

                            in my view MS has made several exaggerations in this article for the purpose of making claims to support his narrow minded arguments:   <br/>
1. To say that Iran - US relations are more fraught than India - Pakistan relations is a gross overstatement. Our geographical proximity alone adds much more complication to our relations than Iran - US relations can ever be.<br/><br/>
2. PM's portrayal as a man obsessed with himself is also erroneous. Anybody in history driven by a deep sense of purpose will have virtues of impatience and bias for action. It's far better than sitting and warming a chair.<br/><br/>
3. The NSA has proved himself effective in dealing with complex and complicated situations in the past moreover India - Pakistan situation is as much of a security issue as it is a diplomatic one. His involvement in the diplomatic process seems to be a wise decision.<br/><br/>
4. The claim of numerous gains made diplomatically in 1977 and during UPA 1 &amp; 2 also seems hollow. If at all they remain gains &amp; losses on paper with nothing to show for in terms of tangible results. <br/><br/>
5. Also we don't know for sure if there was a complete absence of any back channel talks between the two countries as is being portrayed by MS in the article. <br/><br/>
Lastly while he likes to take pot shots at others I am sure while writing the last lines in the article the names of Warren Anderson &amp;  Ottavio Quattrocchi would have definitely crossed his mind. A call for some sense of proportion &amp; balance is not uncalled for.

You are one of the finest speakers in the country. You were the Minister at one of the richest Ministries in the government and yet there was never a taint on you. You pioneered oil diplomacy in the country, for which they sacked you. And yet....why you willfully make yourself Congress hit man and the doormat for your bosses, is something we will never comprehend.

                            Well written article. Let us not be prejudiced by political affiliations. There is a lot of merit in what is stated in the article and it is very clear that, just as the TV anchors who think that they are the experts in Diplomacy, home affairs, finance, health etc, etc, the PM Modi thinks that he can handle every thing and there is no need for the ministerial officials who are the experts in different fields. The PM should clearly state his OBJECTIVES/GOALS and also dictate a time frame: let the appointed officials deal with everything else. Of course, the PM should have the final say, but not participate in every minute discussion and hit the press conference immediately. <br/><br/>
I also thought that our country had a Foreign Minister:  what is she doing!

People like MSI have been visiting Pakistan for the last 40+ years and have nothing to speak of as achievement excepting free lunches. Has Pakistan moved an inch from its stand on Kashmir or war mongering? So this man can keep shouting from the roof top and advising the current Govt. With no achievement to his credit, all his useless advise can not be taken seriously. Its fine, if it helps him to earn his living. No one wants to stop that. Poor fellow.

I am sure he believes congress has shown all of these qualities. Kashmir militancy started in 1980's (thanks to your party Mr.Aiyar!) and 35 years later we are nowhere near a solution. Majority of 35 years Congress was in power using their patience, perseverance and political will with clear goals. How much more time do your need Mani?!<br/><br/>
Even this fellow knows the Ufa thing collapsed because Pak Army didn't want this deal to go ahead. If Pakistan solves the Kashmir issue, their own country will collapse because jihadi's will start fighting among themselves &amp; against the government for power! Pakistan gains by keeping the kashmir issue on boil. Pakistan survives as one nation by keeping Kashmir on the boil. With the reason of their existence solved, what more will jihadi's fight for since that is the only thing they know?<br/><br/>
Until Pakistan solves it's domestic issues, no govt and no amount of patience, perseverance, cler goals and all that crappy big words that Mani uses will bring us anywhere near to a solution. <br/><br/>
Political will he says. Pakistan doesn't have the will to solve issues. You can't sit across the table with someone who doesn't want to solve problems.

But the brainless wonders who fanatically support Modi and his fascistic BJP will do the only thing they have been programmed to do, write their usual moronic views while throwing their uncivilised abuse at Mr. Aiyar, one of the most clear thinking people in India and well respected by intelligent people around the world.--<br/><br/>
If Modi keeps on living up to his reputation of Indian version of Hitler and behaving as one man band, then nobody should be surprised when he ends up making a complete dog's dinner not only out of his negotiations with the well known rouge establishment of Pakistan, but also of most other matters, as can be seen with him staying completely silent over all the scams and scandals involving many prominent BJP leaders including his foreign minister and various chief ministers. <br/>

                            Mani the moron referring to sycophancy in the very first paragraph of his article is like the pot calling the kettle black.  That said, Mani the moron must face a few home truths himself: 1. He isn't the foreign policy expert that he obviously thinks he is, 2. it is the BJP in power, not Congress.  The BJP is quite capable of making its own decisions; it does not need lessons from a nationally reviled sycophant like Mani the moron who worms his way into every aspect of Indian media, 3. Mani the moron was a professional diplomat and his only achievement was the he didn't achieve anything; on the contrary, he switched loyalty when in Pakistan and today has more Pakistani friends than he has Indian, 4. As for comparing Iran/USA to Pakistan/India, Iran was as much a client state of the USA as was Pakistan, going back to the time when the USA threw out the democratically elected Mossadeq and installed the Shah.  USA has always interfered in the internal affairs of Iran and Pakistan; India is an independent country albeit the main opposition, Congress is in the hands of an Italian waitress, 5. Modi will not use the norms laid down by Congress in the diplomatic field; he did not get elected so that he could follow the failed policies of Congress.  The Indo-Pakistan as well as the Indo-Sino problems commences under Congress, continued under Congress and failed under Congress.  Modi has the mandate, the will and the support of the people to try things his own way.  He is not obliged to, never will be obliged to and sees no need the follow the edicts of Mani the moron who is more known by his sycophancy to the Gandhi family than anything else.  All the Doon School education, St Stephen's education, Cambridge education and rather than have a glittering, successful career Mani the moron is reduced to rabid sycophancy to an Italian waitress!  And he still thinks Modi should follow his edicts!
