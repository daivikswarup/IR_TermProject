Headline::::Why Kanhaiya Kumar's Halo Will Disappear Soon



DateTime::::2016-03-08T14:04:00+05:30




                                Many top politicians of today started off as student leaders. But the halo thrust upon Kanhaiya Kumar may wither away soon as he lacks organisational support.
The latest enfant terrible of Indian politics, an anarchist who threatens to destroy the settled order of national discourse, the Johnny-come-lately who is upstaging stalwarts of many hues, a flash in the pan whose media longevity won't be much longer than the stubble he sports on his face - Kanhaiya Kumar is probably all that and more. Just as so many are competing to run him down, there are probably more extolling his virtues and talent, asserting he is India's new Brown Hope, the Kanhaiya, who, like his legendary ancestor, has arrived to battle evil and establish a "kingdom of the good".
The JNUSU President, a boyish orator with a bedraggled look, appears to have swept a section of the middle class and the predictable segment of the media off their feet. Last week, an Opposition MP approached me in the Central Hall of parliament pleading for help to get an appointment with the new middle class hero. I admonished him saying it was beneath his dignity to make a beeline for a man who has achieved nothing of consequence except to spend a few days behind bars. But the former minister was unfazed. "He is my hero. Did you hear his speech that day? I haven't heard anything like that in decades," he continued to exult.
What explains this Kanhaiya-mania that the national capital and its surrounding areas are gripped with? In recent times, the middle class seems to be giving vent to its myriad frustrations by latching on to real or potential leaders, bestowing them with larger-than-life characteristics. The disillusionment with party politics has resulted in individual charisma acquiring a fatal charm, irrespective of ideological hue. It is the same craving for a "hero" that led the voters of Delhi to repose overwhelming faith in a former tax official-turned-anti-corruption-crusader and anoint him Chief Minister at the head of a ramshackle party.
What was Arvind Kejriwal's USP? He connected with the underprivileged, spoke their language and acted against political orthodoxy. As Chief Minister of Delhi, he sat on dharna despite the bitter January cold and blinding rain over the utterly irrelevant issue of transferring two policemen! Through all such antics, he successfully projected the image of being a bechara (hapless person). From time to time, the public is infatuated with a Raj Kapoor-like bechara in politics. And that is precisely the image Kanhaiya Kumar is trying to convey.

But unlike Kejriwal, Kanhaiya is ideologically oriented. He belongs to a political family of Bihar, which has a background in the Communist Party of India (CPI). In JNU, he is firmly a part of the Left-wing students' movement. No wonder a former JNU students' leader, current CPI(M) General Secretary, Sitaram Yechury, has declared that Kanhaiya will campaign for the Left in the forthcoming West Bengal Assembly elections, although the man himself is yet to confirm this.
Many important political leaders of contemporary India have emerged from the students' movement, be it the Nav Niram agitation in Gujarat and Bihar in the early 1970s, or the anti-Emergency struggles of 1975 to 1977. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, for instance, was President of the Delhi University Students' Union when the Emergency was clamped and he was sent to jail for 19 months. In Bihar, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Sushil Kumar Modi and others of their generation in the Patna University Students' Union were similarly put behind bars in 1975. Their sacrifices catapulted them to leadership positions in the immediate aftermath of the Emergency and they all remain major political leaders to date.
Even earlier, the Naxalite movement in West Bengal universities threw up a galaxy of student leaders (most notably Ashim Chatterjee or Kaka) but they failed to remain politically active for long. Some of them were picked up by the police and never heard of again; others "sold out", became informers and were rehabilitated in discreet government jobs or quietly sent off to British or American universities. Mrs Indira Gandhi and her associates like Siddhartha Shankar Ray in West Bengal effectively snuffed out the most serious ideological challenge to the Indian state that has been mounted hitherto.
But can Kanhaiya be categorised in their league? Despite his Left-wing idealism and apparent commitment to a nebulous notion called Azaadi, he lacks a movement of his own. He will soon discover that his JNUSU comrades may merrily play footsie with "revolution" but their eyes are firmly set on the Civil Services or equivalent private sector jobs. If Kanhaiya follows the path of conventional politics, joining established political parties, he will have to go through the grind like, say, Lalu Prasad or Sitaram Yechury or Arun Jaitley for that matter had to do. And thus the "uniqueness" of Kanhaiya Kumar will be lost in the sea of conventional politics.
In any case, established parties will soon advise him to tone down his azaadi brand of rhetoric. The term does not have a positive resonance in most of India because of its close association with anti-India and pro-Pakistan elements in the Kashmir Valley. It is one thing to be hyperbolic within the confines of the JNU Campus, always known for its extreme form of Bohemian politics that has never connected with the wider population. Even Delhi's other universities, DU or Jamia have been immune to the kind of Left-wing extremism which Lenin described as "infantile disorder".
Because he was arrested on the charge of sedition, in the eyes of a section of the youth, Kanhaiya has acquired a halo today. There is little doubt that he will be invited by students' bodies across the country and widely applauded for his simplicity, oratory and ideological commitment. But the halo that has been suddenly thrust upon him will dissipate as soon as the novelty wears off, and Kanhaiya fails to build an organisation to push him forward. As part of the conventional Left, he may become a showpiece for some months, but the straitjacketed, neo-Stalinist organisational structure of Communist parties will never allow an individual talent to grow bigger than the collective wisdom of their gerontocrats. If in doubt about this formulation, Kanhaiya would do well to ask DP Tripathi (firebrand left-wing JNUSU leader of his time and current Rajya Sabha MP of the NCP).
The only thing remarkable about Kanhaya is that he has come as another reminder of the growing disenchantment with conventional politics and politicians. For some years, NGOs seemed to offer hope of a non-corrupt leadership. But that too has withered away. Hence the experiment with new "finds" - be that Anna Hazare, Arvind Kejriwal or Kanhaiya Kumar. Clearly, however, they will either move into oblivion or opt out of conventional politics or end up as temporary showpieces of student protest. The nebulous, nondescript and utterly unacceptable slogan of azaadi in a free country will finally be rejected by those who are shouting such meaningless slogans today, mesmerised by a student leader's simplicity of appeal.(Dr. Chandan Mitra is a journalist, currently Editor of The Pioneer Group of Publications.

                            Chandan Mitra is very correct, come end of April, other then the court cases there will not be anything left for Kanhayia to celebrate...People now understand that there are several Leftist and anti-National professors at JNU (search YT for their campus lectures), who are teaching perverted ideologies of breaking India to the students. For them Indian state is tyrant, in illegal occupation of J&amp;K, North East and other states of India. The HRD Ministry should now ask for credential checks of all these professors at JNU and make them sign a bond, never to question India's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

                            Media with vested interest need someone who can oppose , speak against Modi. earlier they found AK now Kanhaiya , tomorrow may be some one else. I am surprised kind of free publicity given to Kanhiya Sir since he was abusing system and Modi. The same media blatantly ignored 15 year old Girl Jhanavi who was speaking in favour of Modi. This is partisan journalism being professed by some channels and journalists in India.

                            Chandan Mitra comes from Bengal, a state that has borne the brunt of Left misrule and atrocities. Communists are very adept at intellectual posturing and telling lies effectively. Our record shows that, in India more innocent people are killed by left inspired violence than other forms of terrorism. The agenda of left is to cause failure of Indian state and when situation is appropriate, establish dictatorship in India. When they do that, we can all be sure of the following things;<br/>
1) Change India's name to "Democratic socialist republic of India"<br/>
2) No freedom of speech and expression will be allowed<br/>
3) Atrocious rule in India with total state control of peoples life, people in Bengal have faced some forms of this under left rule.

                            Well said. This Kanhaiya is only a flash in the pan. And he would not have been that also except for the comical desperation of the opposition parties, especially the left, to cling on to any issue that they can beat the government with. Not to mention the sensation seeking media, some of whom proudly claimed to be the first to have interviewed him after he got bail. One would have thought that he was some Nelson Mandela come out after 27 years in prison! Kanhaiya's intrinsic value is zero, which will soon be established.

                            It is amazing that Chandan Mitra is still trying to persuade people to believe that Kanhaiya shouted anti national slogans. The BJP and the public prosecution team have not been able to show a shred of evidence against him. Do the Indian public seriously believe that if the BJP had any video/audio evidence that would not give the same to channels like the Times Now? I think the Indian public are emotional but they are mature. You cannot fool us all the time.<br/><br/>
JNU has given to India student leaders like Chandrasekhar who was murdered while working for the grassroot people in Bihar.

As Indians. we can never appreciate a young talent, like ever !! This aura of negativity was there when Kejriwal started as well. Chandan Mitra might have forgotten Arun Jaitley saying on record, that he would retire from politics if AAP got more than 4 seats. Jaitley has not yet retired and is still renting out laptops for 16,000 per month. <br/>
Whatever happens with Kanhaiyya is not certain, just like any other event of the world. Though one thing is certain, Kanhaiya has earned much more respect with his struggle, grit and big-heartedness over the last month, than Chandan Mitra would ever accumulate in his life. <br/>
I dont even understand why he got a space at ndtv columns. What the heck has he done in his life !

                            Mr Chandan Mitra, You're right that Kanhaiya Kumar doesn't have organizational support. But remember, true leaders never have organizations. Organizations get automatically created for the true leader. The problem with RSS is that it only has an organization, but no true leaders. History tells us that it's always the true leader who finally succeeds.

                            One can't discount everything that Chandan has stated but one thing even he acknowledges that there is a clear disenchantment with the currrent political class. That is enough for a spark to become fire and raze the corrupt system to ground. Kanhaiya himself has stated that he intends to go for teaching, so his political ambitions are yet not certain. Chandan Mitra implicitly acknowledges the fault lines in his own political party by this article. Kanhaiya may not end up as a politician but he certainly symbolises the disgust that masses nurture against the hypocrite political masters of the day.

                            BJP does not learn lessons fast. It had earlier dismissed Arvind Kejriwal calling his movement "the tyranny of the unelected". But when Kejriwal entered the fray and got elected he swept the BJP lock, stock and barrel. It is Darwin's law of natural selection -- if the current leadership is deficient someone else will take its place quite naturally. Second, no political party should antagonise the students because no community has the verve, idealism and courage to take on the might of the state as students do. Students are not carried away by TV news debates because they are most active on social media, and by consequence they always have an edge in information gathering. After Kanhaiya's arrest when we were trying to figure out what had happened in JNU through TV news debates, students had already galvanised their support behind Kanhaiya as they were aware of what was said and unsaid, fake and real videos, who is telling the truth and who is lying. Kanhaiya only talked about taking help from new media in an interview with Ravish Kumar. But BJP thinks all the bad-mouthing by its cyber cell members will be enough to win a debate. Therein lies the faultline.

He has been a total failure in everything else and is now trying to cover it up by fighting imaginary anti-nationals.

                            Chandan this article is nothing but your frustration which is very similar to how Congress was dismissing Anna andolan. The reason why Kanhiya is now heard by so many because he speaks the exact his 'own version' of 'ache din'. This will not down good with BJP bosses. Your comparing him with Arvind is a clear sign of how seriously you are taking him as a threat. Arvind humiliated and embarrassed BJP in Delhi by winning with more than thumping majority and you still like to call him 'bechara'. I think you write a letter to Harayan CM calling him 'bechara' under whom a particular section of the society took law and order in their own hands and your CM looked at them like a 'bechara'

                            Chandan.. the fact that you are writing this long monologue shows that Kanhaiya does have some effect on you. Your article is more a personal diatribe on Kanhaiya than something of any substance. You seem to think that no individual can achieve anything without the support of a party or an organization. The fact that he has kindled hope in most of us itself means he has achieved it. Most importantly, till date there is no shred of evidence that he was an anti nationalist, but you and your kind keep harping about it. All the videos turned out to be doctored, so what is your basis to brand him bad. Think about it. Let the new world take over with new thoughts, which do not bring religion or caste into their domain. You say he has an "apparent commitment to a nebulous notion called Azaadi". Shame... it is not nebulous but clear and definite. Whether it is the BJP, Congress or any other party, remember times are changing

                            "In recent times, the middle class seems to be giving vent to its myriad frustrations by latching on to real or potential leaders, bestowing them with larger-than-life characteristics" - this is true, but I can't believe you are saying this - the person who benefited the most from this is your guruju feku maharaj! Who made Kanhaiya a hero, Mr Mitra? Your government tried to destroy a poor patriotic students life. You failed, and then he gave that speech which Tunku Varadarajan (famous journalist) and Modi supporter calls one of the best political speeches in independent India. Now that everything you have done has backfired, you are counting your losses. Jealousy is pouring out of your article. But you benefited from the same phenomenon when it was Modi.

                            After all he is a student. Why is BJP and Co. taking this too personal and as if he is a competition to Modi? We think PM of India is well above this kid. No need for BJP to bite around everything it sees on its way. Let them focus on what they had promised (economy and development) to India and not on other priorities (making everyone eat, drink, talk, wear etc what they think is appropriate)

                            Mr Mitra you are correct . Can you please ask your cronies to drop sedition charges against Kanhaiya Kumar ? The govt made him a hero due to its sheer arrogance and stupidity and would be well advised to make the course correction as soon as possible . The longer you keep this issue simmering the more it is going to backfire on you . The fact that Mr Mitra choose to talk about Kanhaiya's lack of organsiation skills etc shows that the party is already trying to douse the fire that it lit. If not, maybe these are Mr Mitra's own personal views and we should not give too much importance to it

                            @Guest4321:  Fascinating how an 'ignorant' post gets 175 likes. It shows the level or our discourse. 1. Read the constitution of India's Name you may be shocked to see that the Left went back in time and magically changed this 69 years ago  2. It is the left parties in India that have consistently advocated and fostered free speech. That is why Bengal and Kerala have such high literacy rates and political awareness. It has been the right wing parties like the one we have now and including for a few years by authoritarian Congress governments when this was curtailed. 3. This is correct because the Left believes in socialism where the poor are taken care of at the expense of the rich and is why they kept winning for so many years. <br/><br/>
I do not subscribe to a purely socialist point of view but with such a vast disparity in wealth and access of resources, India does need to have many socialist policies. Even the Modi Govt now has fallen back on the social policies that were the only hope of the Poor farmers specially in crisis times like 2015-2016.

This halo was gifted by the BJP-led NDA Govt.'s impatient implementation of RSS-BJP clan's sinister design to thrust everybody and every institution with their orthodox ideology, which is completely devoid of intellect.

                            That's what you wish. I am disappointed to learn that Kanhaiya will fail because he has no organisation support. This implies that in today's world truth has no space, unless backed by a large organisation. We as a society should hang our heads in shame. Thank you Dr. Mitra for reminding us this important fact, which has been the backbone of success for BJP/RSS.

                            Yes Chandan Mitra you are right in saying that. But the Azadi, although i differ it with its conceptual orientation, more relevant would be the 'Adhikar' and not azadi.<br/><br/>
But Chandan, how you can disown the 'rights' that every downtrodden of this society is constitutionally entitled for. You may disown Kanaihya but not the constitutional rights that the women, farmers, dalits, poor, tribes are entitled to. <br/><br/>
Every one has the right to question and demand their legitimate right, Where is the black money? Where is the pension for our Army pensioners? Where is the employment for my young generation? Where? ? ? One cannot disown our right to question our legitimate rights.

Pl have brainstorming within your party, find some breakthrough ideas and work on growth, which should provide jobs and business opportunities.

Rather as a free thinker , he should engage in a intellectual discourse to address the concern raised by a Student in JNU , rather than villifying him ... he must try and convince in a logical &amp; rational way, why he is wrong nd why Mr Mitra is right .. without promoting closure of JNU and shutting down the students mouth or by creating a fear psychosis in the minds of student community !!!!

                            Chandan Mitra , who had lost all his organisational backing when Advani was pushed into the background, is now desperately trying to score brownie points with Modi &amp; Shah. If Chandan Mitra was so principled, why did he arrange with Rudy, the then Civil Avaition Minister, in 2002, to publish a glossy magazine for the dying Alliance Air! Just to earn some money for his almost defunct Pioneer group of Publications?<br/>
Persons with no worthwhile track record as journalists, like Balbir Punj and Chandan Mitra have attached themselves to the Rath yatra in the hope of getting free goodies like Rajya sabha seats. Now their time is up. Newer fans of the BJP like Swapan Dasgupta and Madhu Kishwar &amp; Tavleen Singh now wait in the wings.

                            Chandan it is high time for you go on pension, you are finished with any power and capability to analyse any thing, your master are going to loose all the election as a result of your advices for example " close the JNU and better all the educational institutes and universities in the country". You might have closed the Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard also because many of the founders of left movement in India were educated in these universities, because there was freedom of voice and discussions. This article is, as rightly commented by some, a ball of fire due to explosion of a atom bomb as a result of a short circuit between the Sangh and JNU Young vibrant students impatient to acquire freedom of discussion, which some people are bent upon to curb not only in JNU but also in each and every University and educational institute of India and may be else where also ! In their imaginations.

                            Totally incorrect and politically coloured interpretation. The problem with BJP is they are way too complacent! Hope they learn their lessons after Delhi and Bihar. The biggest mistake for any nation is to ignore the voice of the youth engaged in academics with ideology and no hooliganism in their minds. BJP is scared of an enlightened and bold youth. That's it!

                            I am surprised that NDTV allows this fascist BJP MP to publish his garbage propaganda article, only sometime back he was demanding that JNU be closed down.<br/><br/>
Now if that is not fascism what is?

                            Just consider: At a subsidy of 3 lakhs per annum per JNU student, we have probably already spent 15 lakhs of taxpayer money on 30-year old youth Kanhaiya. The fellow is still to complete his PhD in "African studies". By the time he is done in 2 years (optimistically!) we would have spent 21 lakh on this character. What is the nation going to get out of it in return for this investment?

KK is NOT guilty of sedition.<br/><br/>
In the view of right wingers he may be held guilty of Leftist ideology. This is NOT sedition.<br/><br/>
Bassi, Rajnath Singh, Modi must all apologise for the wrongful arrest on the false case of sedition. Bassi should be given exemplary punishment.

                            Strange are the ways of the mainstream media Mr. Mitra. How does a speech by a student neta inside a University campus be front page national news ? Thousands of such netas give these anti establishment idealist speeches in colleges across the nation everyday to young students. Would that be covered as breaking news ? Amazing stuff media.

How can you say same thing for kahnaiya kumar,  i am sure , that he is a perfect match for modi,<br/>
let have a face to face debate on all TV channels of both modi and kanhaiya kumar and the whole india and world will decide who is good orator and spokesperson hahahahah

Whether you agree or disagree, it doesn't matters.<br/><br/>
Regarding Kanhayia's case, how your Government dealt with it is not correct.<br/>
It has already made a huge dent on your party and Government. Also it made all the people to understand how poorly the case was handled by your party and inefficient ministers and how capable the people are in doctoring the videos.<br/>
Please read the reports of Hindustan Times written a few days back, who is behind all these in doctoring the video. <br/>
Your HRD minister is the most in-efficient minister the country has ever produced. <br/>
I know it sounds itching to you. But fact remains as a fact, how bitter it is!!!

May be it will, but hope you guys have learned the lesson and would not use state machinery to crush small guys for imagined political gains.

                            No doubt, KK is a much hyped media creation who is helping 24X7 channels cash on TRPs. The day they hit some other breaking news, they would forget this son-of-soil. Though everyone is going GAGA over his speech, what was new in it? Do we all not know that there is poverty? Mr Yechuri should answer what has been achieved in 25 years of Left rule in West Bengal? It is as impoverished as it was when Left came to power. There has been more progress under TMC rule than Left. Is it not leadership crisis and irrelevance of Left that makes Mr Yechuri instantly decide on projecting KK as face of left parties in forthcoming elections? The entire leadership and hierarchy of CPI(M) seems to have been sidelined by his move. As about KK, the speech was more rhetorical than substance. KK needs to do introspection, what had he joined JNU for? Was political entry his ambition and if so was it meant to be at tax payers cost? If that was not the case, what has been his academic excellence so far? He seems to be an overaged student who is trying to find solace in University (JNU) and not facing the realities that demand a proactive intervention from his side. What are the employment opportunities available to him at this age except joining the faculty of JNU? He has more questions to answer than to ask.

                            Keep it simple Mr Mitra. No one knows what the country will think about him or what he will do or engage in the near and distant future. Only an oracle and Chandan Mitra is no oracle but a loyal foot soldier of BJP. The fun is in seeing how thongs connected with Kanihya Kumar will unfold.

                            Oh Chandan Mitra!!! why so much strain in your efforts to paint Kanhayya and Kejriwal in poor light. If they are small fries, what brought you out form hiding and force you to write this piece of garbage? Yours, Mohandas Pie,s and many more writing article on kanahayya albeit in criticism smacks some of the fears BJP and your political bosses are feeling deep inside their guts. We understand your compulsions and feel pity for you.

Yes we know how Indira Gandhi has nipped in the bud many a brilliant careers, but my dear Mr. Mitra politics is now in the times of Digital, or you think your Jumla prime minister would come to power?
