Headline::::India's Poverty is Social Violence



DateTime::::2015-04-21T23:36:00+05:30




                                There are many exiles faced by India's poor. They are exiled from the consciences of the people of privilege and wealth. They are exiled from our cinema, television and newspapers. They are exiled from the priorities of public expenditure and governments. They are exiled from debates in Parliament and offices. They are exiled from institutions that could offer them some basic security through education, healthcare and social security. And they are exiled from the hope that their children or their grandchildren will one day escape a life of backbreaking toil and social humiliation.
This last is the most profound of their exiles. In my new book 'Looking Away: Inequality, Prejudice and Indifference in New India' I speak of these many exiles, but most of all, the exile from hope.
P Chidambaram, former Finance Minister, in an interview with the BBC in 2007, declared his confidence that by 2040, India would wipe out poverty. What is noteworthy, firstly, is that the poverty of which he promised erasure is closer to near starvation-level ultra-poverty, not poverty as defined by the global norm of $2 income per day; secondly, he did not regard this timetable problematic in any way. The deputy chairperson of India's Planning Commission during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) years, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, also went on record with the same time frame. Anthropologist Akhil Gupta observes: 'By the time the Indian government plans to wipe out poverty, very few of the poorest people living today will still be alive. Such a statement makes sense... only against a backdrop in which high rates of poverty are taken as normal.'
Gupta illustrates this normalisation of poverty by posing a vexing question: why does a state whose legitimacy should derive from bettering the lives of the poor, continue to allow between 250 and 427 million people to live in desperate poverty, and deny them food, shelter, clean water, sanitation and healthcare? He suggests that poverty is a form of 'structural violence'; that there is little substantive difference between genocide and simply allowing poor people to die. He calculates conservatively that about 2 million people have died of malnutrition and preventable diseases every year in post-colonial India. The total number of people who died in India's last major famine, the Great Bengal Famine of 1943, was three million. The annual number of India's hidden, avoidable deaths dwarfs the annual loss of human life resulting from all natural disasters globally, estimated at about 300,000.
The reason why the preventable deaths of these many millions year after year is not 'considered exceptional, a tragedy and a disgrace', according to Gupta, is the normalization of poverty.
Indeed, for most people in India, just as there are hills, valleys, deserts, rivers and forests in this teeming, ancient country, there is also poverty. There has been poverty in the past, it exists in the present, and it will endure long into the foreseeable future. The social acceptability of letting people stay poor, therefore, is not considered problematic. Not providing food, clothing, shelter and healthcare to people in dire need is not seen as killing them. This social violence is rendered invisible so that poverty does not constitute a scandal, and the preventable deaths of masses of the poor do not provoke soul-searching or public outrage.
I argue also that the challenges of inequality in India are compounded by the powerful revival of the politics of difference, a new conservatism, and the evidence of active social and state hostility towards minority groups and communities, reflected in grossly under-provisioned Muslim ghettoes, religious profiling in both terror-related and other crimes, and the extra-judicial killings of tribals, Muslims and Dalits. There is a growing appeal among the middle classes of right-wing politics that often combines market fundamentalism with hostility towards minorities and India's neighbours. In the general elections of 2014, this mood was best represented by Narendra Modi, who fought a blistering electoral battle deploying 'shock and awe' tactics against his adversaries-including liberals, socialists, 'secularists' and minorities - whom he felled decisively to become India's sixteenth prime minister.
Of all the major political parties seeking votes in the 2014 elections, the BJP, through its prime ministerial candidate, offered the Indian electorate perhaps the most cohesive, if troubling, vision for the country. Modi offered a combination of three fundamentalisms. First, a market orthodoxy, which guarantees unprecedented levels of subsidies to big business in the form of long tax holidays, soft loans, cheap land and electricity, at the expense of public expenditure on education, health, social protection and public infrastructure. Next was communal fundamentalism, constituting barely -disguised hostility towards religious minorities, especially Muslims, which was the main rallying agenda on the ground in electorally-crucial states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. And the third was a militarist fundamentalism, envisioning an aggressive foreign policy, including war with Pakistan.
Modi's offer to the voters was a kind of 'buy one, get two free' political bargain, but one in which you cannot embrace one of the fundamentalisms without also accepting the others.
 
The attraction to the middle classes to this kind of politics, I argue in my book, is because they are raised in three normative systems which justify inequality. The first of these is the caste system, which validates a social order in which a person's birth legitimately determines her life chances, her access to education and the livelihoods open to her. The second is the British class system, in which people with old wealth, combined with exclusive education, acquire 'refined' lifestyles that mark them out from the 'boorish lower classes' and the 'upstart new rich'. And the last of these is the more recently acquired celebration of conspicuous consumption associated with the collapse of the socialist world and the rise of neo-liberal, market-led growth. The dominant value is that 'greed is good'- it is time to liberate oneself from the 'socialist guilt' of the past, to abandon old-fashioned values of thrift, restraint and modesty, and instead to make - or inherit - money and spend on oneself with no restraints or inhibitions.
 
This is the new India which celebrates when India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, follows up his gift of a 60-million-dollar jet-plane to his wife with the most expensive residence in the world, a twenty seven-storey house for a family of four, built at an estimated cost of one billion dollars, which boasts three helipads, four storeys of hanging gardens, and a staff of 600 domestic helpers. This, in a city where at least two hundred thousand people sleep on pavements, and more than 40 per cent of the population lives in shanties.
 In the words of film-maker Saeed Mirza, "Large sections of the formerly 'stoic' middle class got seduced. It got seduced by all the goodies on display: food, clothes, cars, electronic gadgets, toiletries, beverages, shoes and everything else on display in those incredibly inviting store windows and shelves. It began to party. It was almost as if after years and years of abstinence this solid bloc of sobriety had gone on a binge. What nobody realized was that the centre of the nation had caved in. There was nothing to temper the onslaught of excess. All this was happening in a country where over seventy per cent of citizens lived on less than two dollars a day."
 
This explains also why there is resistance among people of relative privilege to legislation which aims to make access to food, shelter, education, work and healthcare the fundamental right of every Indian citizen. Or to efforts to implement policies of affirmative action for historically -disadvantaged groups. There is, in reality, a hierarchy of citizenship under the thin veneer of equal citizenship guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. Full citizenship is enjoyed only by the middle and upper classes-and even within these groups, it is enjoyed much more fully by urban, upper-caste, Hindu, non-tribal, able-bodied, heterosexual men. Today, the neo-middle classes and the aspirational classes are knocking on the doors of these dominant groups, hoping not to change the status quo, but to share its privilege.(Harsh Mander is a human rights worker, writer, columnist, scholar and teacher, works with survivors of mass violence, hunger, homeless persons and street children.

                            It's a fact that there is poverty in our country. The writer points finger at the whole society for neglecting the poor and in usual leftist thinker style fail to provide any solution. The need of the hour is solutions to these long running problems. Now taking names of a single industrialist and to blame him and his family for the poverty in India is taking this debate to the dumbs. He is a second generation rich, his father had a tough time building the  company or monster. So what about the poverty in our country before that. Now the question is how to bring out people from poverty? My answer is to create jobs and opportunity for the poor, so that everyone can earn and aspire to a better standard of living. By the way, I am an Indian Christian and I do not feel victimised or helpless because of that. I find my fellow citizens from other religion going through the same. We have our constitution, which guarantees my rights. And no one neither you or the other side  can take that away

                            Spoils the article, by having a anti modi, anti hindu bias. Worst kind of intellectual fraud, typical of romila thapar. His reasoning is wrong, conclusions are so much bull. To help this socalled 427 million people resources are required. Where are they. I think I will buy his book and see if i can do something about this poverty class. Also i believe Bernard shaw, when he says "poverty is a CRIME". Mander should be complimented for bringing this stinging slap to our awareness. We know that freebies, sops, subsidies are no solution. Then why not country go for khadi as a national service. It can employ millions of people. We do not need economics of automated machined here. Please, Mr mander, bring it to Modi's notice without any bias and we shall see his response on this.

                            After all the show of serious social writing its "Modi &amp; secularism &amp; communalism &amp; minorities &amp; Hinduism....blah blah blah ". What does it have to do with poverty? Also BJP ruled us for 6 years + this one year. "Socialist Secular Democratic Pro-poor" Congress &amp; similar other versions ruled us for more than 60 years. But the blame for poverty is in inverse proportion !! That's the reason the so called Secular Liberals have such low credibility in India.

                            Author is clever not to discuss solutions. Many of us are aware of the problems but I must congratulate the author for collating all the issues and problems in one place and explaining clearly.  The problem is how best to use the limited resources we have to solve the issues and how to sequence the problems to be solved. Should we try to solve all the issues at once or should we solve them one by one and what is the cost of each approach?  In my opinion, the best way to start is to create jobs for our people instead of handling out doles.  Of course creating jobs will involve land acquisition, more construction, more infrastructure, more industries and incentives for industries to make them viable, as there are no better options.

                            Mr Harsh Mandar is one of the advocates of MNREGA a substantively flawed scheme which should have been more smartly devised and incentive driven and productive. The scheme should have encourage smart innovation and more money given to ones who use it in away that empowers and facilitates lifting the poor out of poverty and not making it a mechanism to give some handouts/dole to the poor.  We have to find a mechanism to prevent the poorest of the poor from multiplying like rabbits and the only answer to it in lies in universal and compulsory education and literacy. We have to rid our politics of competition encouraging and celebrating poverty. There are many people who come from very poor background who have made it big or successful. The country offers and affords that. Let us look at a country like USA, what would have happened to it if it had India's population. a vast majority of citizen would be in the same condition as it is in India. Let us stop celebrating poverty the way the left does and let us encourage people who create jobs. But people who creates jobs are vilified as suited and booted thieves. I am saying the only solution to poverty is encouraging entrepreneurship. Government should create the environment. Every state should closely follow the entrepreneur to extend a helping hand. A job created could easily care for another four. So an entrepreneur who creates job for 10 people has brought financial support for at least 40 people. Just imagine the multiplier effect an entrepreneur bring to societies financial prosperity. We have great entrepreneurial pool but suppressed due to regressive laws that looks at businesses as opportunistic crooks. Many laws are flawed to that effect of looking at an average citizen as some out to cheat the government. You can see it all around you. We need to correct all this and celebrate honest good entrepreneur at town halls and not in 5 star hotels by TV channels and newspapers. The local Panchayat leader or municipality leaders should take initiative to celebrate entrepreneurs for creating jobs and contributing societies welfare.   There are very many such initiative that are required to lift our society from poverty and not handouts or doles that tends to make lazy citizen.

                            The solution offered by author is flawed. He misses the basic human tendency. Or an aspect of it. Poor people are poor are not due to exploitation. Neither due to laziness. It's plain lack of opportunity. Provide them opportunity. Fill them with hunger to succeed. Inspire them to excel. <br/><br/>
Consumption based subsidies, like free food and clothing and housing and reservations, will diminish the drive. They make poor lazy and political class rich.<br/><br/>
Provide them with free education and basic healthcare. That will inspire them. <br/><br/>
And please please provide Harsh Mander a lesson on human psychology. He speaks sans logic and sense.

If my father is poor and I do not work hard enough to move upwards in my life who would be responsible?  Is it the govt of the country or I who has neither intention nor strong determination.   <br/><br/>
According to him those who are poor they are poor because of those who are successful it is out rightly shocking observation.<br/><br/>
Tell me if you running a company would you hire a person who is not skilled enough to work and pay him salary.   This is bad economics the company would be shut down.  Same is true for any country if the people of the country do not take their responsibility how would the country progress?    Govt job is to provide the environment of equal opportunity without any discrimination.    In India it is there it is guaranteed by the constitutions.           <br/><br/>
Stop blaming rich for poverty.  Encourage poor people to give good education to their children which is free till 12th class.  Their children if educated will change the fortune for coming generations.  What is the problem?

Most of post independece India has been ruled by Congress led govts. Who is then responsible for this situation of the farmers today ? Why did they not pay enough attention to farmers in the past ? UPA acquired so much land for SEZ from farmers and half of them still lying idle. When acquiring the land for SEZ did they follow the 70% consent and other norms ? Nope. Congress simply has destroyed the farmers and India's resources.

                            Harsh Mander oscillates between logical arguments and blind prejudices. After independence, India had a socialist policy (which Mander supports) for over 4 decades. The number of people in poverty increased, including those in extreme poverty. The middle class remained relatively better off but the overall living standard was one of the lowest in the world. The reforms of early nineties freed up the economy and all evidence has clearly shown that it has lifted more people out of poverty than what was achieved in the past. The main reason for this was the economic growth of the nation going from about 3% to over 6%. The only way for the poor to be lifted out of poverty is have the economy grow at over 20% for a decade. Modi offers hope that his government will facilitate this kind of economic development and the people have entrusted him to deliver that. The assumption that the government is anti muslim is not borne out by facts despite all the stories &amp; hype. On Pakistan, Modi offered an olive branch but Pakistan prefers to be a safe haven for terrorists. It pays Geelani &amp; Co to whip up anti India sentiment in the valley. If the Indian government objects to terror support, it is considered as "militarist fundamentalism, envisioning an aggressive foreign policy, including war with Pakistan."! The basic issue is as a nation we have failed to lift the poor out of poverty and should debate how we can achieve this instead of getting into meaningless arguments about Muslims &amp; Pakistan.

                            Indians choose to remain poor by their attitude towards life, making it cheap unworthy of affluence. Poor choose to produce more and more of their variety, subdividing their inheritance to a pittance and unsustainable for progress and prosperity.<br/><br/>
the average farmers has much less land then their forefathers as the forefathers created huge family and land got divided to a pittance, and they continue to do so. even they have no food to eat they produce many children, in vain hope of and cultural traditions of more the merrier.

                            Harsh Mander's writing is impassioned and deeply moving. However  shaming the readers to greater awareness and empathy is not the most effective way of exhorting action. Most readers are aware of the grim realities of India and most look away not out of callousness but rather helplessness. <br/><br/>
Poverty is a deeply complex condition. It is economic, social and according to the latest World Bank Development report titled Mind, Society and Behavior it is also psychological. There is a new understanding that is informing the battle against poverty. It is an understanding of how poverty impacts a child's developing brain and which in turn impairs the development of human capacities that are needed to avail of opportunities available to them. It is this understanding that is being used in the west to deal with school dropouts, delinquency, addiction, poor choices and other problem behaviors that keep the poor poor.<br/><br/>
 While the larger structural injustices need to be identified and addressed which Mr Harsh Mander does brilliantly, what is also needed is an encouraging and facilitating of greater participation by greater number of people.

                            @ N Viswanath I do not understand your 'jealousy' factor, it is insensitive from your part to paint a humane quality in a negative way. If you cannot empathise, you  probably would fail to be a good human being who would help or do something positively.
