Headline::::Talking with Pakistanis



DateTime::::2014-12-15T17:44:00+05:30




                                (Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 14 books, including, most recently, Pax Indica: India and the World of the 21st Century.)Meeting a visiting delegation of Pakistani Parliamentarians this week - brought to India by the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT) and hosted at our Parliament library by Mani Shankar Aiyar - offered yet another reminder of the paradoxes of the Indo-Pak relationship. On the one hand it's so easy to slip into a comfort zone with Pakistanis; with language, food, music, movies, clothes and many cultural assumptions in common, they are like familiar cousins, not hostile strangers. On the other, they serve in, and represent, a country that is an avowed enemy of India's, from which a seemingly interminable series of terrorist attacks have emanated as part of an officially-supported campaign to "bleed India to death by a thousand cuts". The success of any Indo-Pak Track II dialogue of this kind therefore requires that it be built on denial. It focuses on making the visitors feel welcome, emphasizes the feel-good aspects of their presence in our midst, celebrates the many things we have in common, and tries to brush the real problems under a carpet (not a Kashmiri carpet, since that might provoke disagreeable thoughts). The Pakistani export of terrorism to India is never mentioned. In other words, Track-II dialogues are a self-fulfilling exercise in self-vindication. Their success depends on denying the very problems that makes such dialogues necessary in the first place. I'm all in favour of Indo-Pak peace and bonhomie. I've seen a lot of it in my decades abroad with the United Nations - where Indian and Pakistani colleagues were always the best of friends, even military officers serving in the Peacekeeping Department. Many a Pakistani cab driver in New York has attempted to decline my money for the fare, saying that I was a brother (this of course always won him a bigger tip, but the spirit was genuine). Indians and Pakistanis overseas are almost always the best of friends, since being in foreign lands enhances their consciousness of what they have in common, which vastly exceeds what divides them. I would love to see a time when Pakistanis and Indians can cross each other's borders with the casualness of Americans and Canadians, work in each other's countries, trade freely with each other and contribute equally to each other's films, music, clothing and creative lives, just as they did (as one country) before 1947. I would be happy if that time came sooner rather than later. But, sadly, I am only too aware that it's not now.In a famous 1947 article in Foreign Affairs, George F. Kennan argued that the Soviet Union's hostility toward the United States was chronic and incurable, since it was rooted not in a classic conflict of interest between two great powers, but in deep-seated nationalism and insecurity on the part of Russia which the US could do nothing about. Something similar could be said about India and Pakistan. Straightforward disagreements between two states can be resolved through dialogue and compromise. But how can that work when Pakistan's abiding hostility towards India is rooted in fundamental insecurity about its national identity as the "not-India" for the sub-continent's Muslims, and even worse, driven by the self-interest of a rapacious military which commands a greater share of the national GDP than the military of any other country in the world, and needs this hostility to justify its power and privileges?The visit of the Pakistani MNAs (as their Members of Parliament are called) did not meet with universal approbation among those who became aware of their presence in New Delhi. For there are not many takers in the Indian political space right now for pursuing dialogue with a country whose military intelligence (or elements thereof) almost certainly have had a hand in every terror attack on Indian soil, even while its government professes peace. Few in the government are prepared to accept that we are obliged to pursue normal relations with a Pakistan that incubates terror while the country's civilian government remains either unable or unwilling to curb the so-called non-state actors who roam freely preaching hatred. Hafiz Saeed's recent rally where he preached jihad against India to 5 lakh deliriously bloodthirsty fanatics could not have taken place without government support. And we are supposed to be nice to such a government, some Indians ask incredulously.It is true that the Pakistani Army, however, selectively, has begun to take on the challenge of fighting some terrorist groups - not the ones lovingly nurtured by the ISI to assault India, but the ones who have escaped GHQ Rawalpindi's control and turned on Pakistan's own military institutions. But the unpalatable fact remains that what Pakistan is suffering from today is the direct result of a deliberate policy of inciting, financing, training, equipping militants and jihadis over 20 years as an instrument of state policy. As Dr. Frankenstein discovered when he built his monster, it is impossible to control the monster once you've created it.Attempts by glibly sophisticated Pakistani spokesmen to portray themselves as fellow victims of terror - indeed, to go so far as to compare the number of deaths suffered by Pakistan in its war against terrorism on its own soil with those inflicted upon India - seek to obscure the fundamental difference between the two situations. Pakistanis are not suffering death and destruction from terrorists trained in India. No one traveled from India to attack the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad or the naval base at Mehran, whereas Pakistanis sailed to Mumbai to wreak mayhem on 26/11 and crossed the border to attack Uri last month. Pakistan has to cauterize a cancer in its own midst, but a cancer that was implanted by itself and its own institutions. And this will only happen if our neighbours eliminate the warped thinking, amongst powerful elements in Islamabad, that a terrorist who sets off a bomb at the Marriott in Islamabad is a bad terrorist whereas one who sets off a bomb at the Taj in Mumbai is a good one. The moment the Pakistani establishment genuinely disavows the nurturing and deployment of terror as an instrument of state policy, and concludes that it faces the same enemy as India and should make common cause with it to stamp out the scourge, is the moment that a genuine prospect of peace will dawn on the subcontinent. Such a sentiment is, alas, far from even glimmering on the horizon.So should New Delhi resume talks with the government in Islamabad? Track-II is all very well, but the days of sari-shawl exchanges have been supplanted by a frigid silence. Talking again before there has been any significant progress in Pakistan bringing the perpetrators of 26/11 to book, many Indians feel, would mean surrendering to Pakistani intransigence. Is there any point talking to people whose territory and institutions are being used to attack and kill Indians?And yet it is also clear that "not talking" to any Pakistanis is not much of a policy. Pakistan can deny our shared history but India cannot change its geography. Pakistan is next door and can no more be ignored than a thorn pierced into India's side. India's refusal to talk after 26/11 worked for a while as a source of pressure on Pakistan. It contributed, together with Western (especially American) diplomatic efforts, to some of Islamabad's initial co-operation, including the arrest of Lashkar-e-Toiba operative Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi and six of his co-conspirators. But it has long passed its use-by date. The refusal to resume dialogue has not just stopped producing any fresh results; the only argument that justifies it - that it is a source of leverage - gives some in India the illusion of influence over events that New Delhi does not in fact possess. Instead, it's ironically India - the victims of 26/11 and other examples of Pakistani malfeasance - who have come to seem intransigent and unaccommodating. The transcendent reality of life on the subcontinent is that it has always been India that wishes to live in peace. India is, at bottom, a status quo power that would like to be left alone to concentrate on its economic development; Indians see Pakistan as the troublemaker, needling and bleeding its neighbour in an effort to change the power balance and wrest control of a part of Indian territory (Kashmir). Refusing to talk doesn't change any of that, but it brought India no rewards and in fact imposed a cost. When Pakistan was allowed to sound reasonable and conciliatory while India seemed truculent and unreasonable, New Delhi's international image as a constructive force for peace took a beating.To say that we will not talk as long as there is terror is essentially to give the terrorists a veto over our own diplomatic choices. For talking can achieve constructive results. It can identify and narrow the differences between our two countries on those issues that can be dealt with, while keeping the spirit of dialogue (and implicitly of compromise) alive. So yes, by all means, let us talk to Pakistan and Pakistanis on every "Track" available. It is what we say when we talk that will make all the difference.

                            The fundamental problem is that pakistan cannot survive if it adopts a progressive world view. It is a fraudulent enterprise built on islam with a rabid anti-India (read Hindu)ideology. Its political, social and cultural space is dominated by obscurantists. Jinnah himself had a right wing anti-socialist project for pakistan. And that is the reason why pakistan was created by the imperialist masters to serve their interests in the region, which it has been doing dutifully ever since.<br/>
Talks will lead nowhere as pakistan needs its (anti hindu) hatred to survive. And its islamic terrorism will continue. <br/>
The best option for pakistan is to explode its fraudulent basis of creation and  re-connect with its bigger, better and stronger eastern neighbour as a fully autonomous state over a long term period. A tall order indeed. Meanwhile, a strategic partnership between Russia , India and China must be formed to exterminate the evil of islamic terrorism from the region.

                            Dear Shashi Tharoor,<br/>
You are quite a learned person. But lacking in common sense, I must say. The people in the administration in Pakistan whom we have been in dialogue for many years now, have absolutely no control on the people and organizations that control Pakistan. As a rustic saying goes: "no point in chanting vedas in to the ear of a buffalo". Get it??<br/>

                            Famously a Pakistani General who went on to become the President of Pakistan has said even if India was to handover J&amp;K on a platter to Pakistan, Pakistan will continue to have its proxy war with India because the Military establishments very existence is defined by battling the villain. So there is no virtually no chance of peace unless this mind set that the existence and budget of the military is directed to fight India to defend Pakistan.

                            India is vast country with need for lots of power. natural resources may be cheaper now, but we cannot totally rely on them and these may not be cheaper forever or available for ever. Though finding place for setting up nuclear plants have been biggest problem, we need to take help of emerging technolgy to make sure fool proof plants are setup, we need to take everyone into confidence before we that. Coming to ur arguement, there were some 20bills signed btw Russia and India, so not sure if they dint talk abt oil and gas. And ppl wont trust u, if Modi would have talked abt Oil n Gas and not abt Nuclear power, then u would have come up with exact opposite argument saying we dint utilize Russia's capability in Nuclear power. Also, why bring Hindutva here? cant expect better from corrupt congi mind.

                            One would not expect Obhama to talk to terrorists.  One would not expect Putin to talk to terrorists.  So why should India?  PAKISTAN is, itself a terrorist state.  The only response that makes sense is a military response.  Tharoor may say that this is not possible against a nuclear armed state.  It is!  When China tried to take Russian territory in 1969, Russia's military responded and went 200 miles into Chinese territory.  When Pakistan took Kargil, India responded militarily.  In both scenarios, both countries possessed nuclear weapons.  So let's not fool ourselves with moronisms (i.e., phrases coined by Moron Shankar Aiyer), such as uninterrupted and uninterruptable talks.  An iron fist behind a velvet glove is called for.

Mr. Shashi - its not about resuming the dialogue when terror is completely gone. Its about being serious about eliminating terror. India can resume dialogue and peace process only when there is a seriousness on Pak's behalf and the will to act against people plotting against India. At this moment nothing such is visible. Terrorism can't be finished in one day but at least there can be positive steps from Pakistan which can instill confidence in the Indians that now it will be the two countries together against terrorism. Until that happens there is no point of any dialogue or peace process.

                            When you see a "Indian Cuisine" sign outside a restaurant in any part of the world, you can never be sure whether the restaurant is owned by Indians or Pakistanis.  On the other hand if the sign reads "Indian and Pakistani cuisine", you know who owns the restaurant. I am yet to see a restaurant sign which only reads "Pakistani cuisine".

                            There are a number of things lacking in the Indian stategy towards Pakistan.  With a troublesome neighbour a little proactiveness is required.  Instead of reacting to issues caused by Pakistani agression, we need to significantly weaken and bleed the proxy-way engine Pakistan has somewhat successfully put into place.  Some of the methods we need to employ may not be Gandian friendly, but we do not have a choice.  Despite our vast human resources, we have not been able to infiltrate the terrorist organizations, forget raiding and taking the training camps in PoK by surprise.   We need to spruce up our counter-intelligence capabilities, that is visibly lacking. And I go agree with Tharoor, we need to keep talking to them, ignoring them is to our peril

                            Pak terrorism is inspired by the Kashmir issue which it wants to bifurcate from India to avenge the severance of East Pakistan in 1971. India will not allow that to happen no matter what the cost. Therefore, to reduce the influence of Pak terror we could modernise the state of Kashmir to such a level that the native population has no choice but to agree that their future with India is the only right solution. It is only the people who can kill the trade of the terrorist, the military can only contain it. Pakistan will then have no choice but to talk. I would rather they be compelled to talk to us than the other way round.

On one hand paki agent Iyer was to sell India to Pak and on the other hand Shashi wants to do the same thing as BJP is doing but in a more politically corrent manner. But the haters will hate BJP no matter what.

                            The unwanted division post independence has costed India so much the only way to overcome the problem is to reverse the transaction by writing off 67 years of division and get Pakistan back to India.  Earlier it was easier now its tough since Pakistan being nuclear power but yet somehow.

                            Pakistani Members of Parliament 'hosted at our Parliament library by Mani Shankar Aiyar'. Not surprice to see him as a champion of track 2 diplomacy.

                            These are all Dirty Tricks that are being played by Both the Governments of India and Pakistan.To ask a Lion and Tiger to become Vegetarians is completely useless.Pakistan from 1947 till 1991 had the false hope of Conquering India like Ghazni,Ghori,Timur,Babur Nadir Shah and Ahmed Shah did in Medieval Periods.A Po9werfula dnPatriotic Army and POwerful Defense Weapons are now Assets of India. That is why Pakistan is patronizing Home Grown Terrorism and a Powerful Fifth Column in India.From 2004 to 2014 these two got strengthened. Now to dismantle them is top priority.

                            Lasting peace and American/Canadian borders between India and Pakistan is only possible if and when Kashmir issue is resolved.Everything else; all tracks are just an eyewash!

                            Three fourth of the way down the article, I was pleasantly surprised to read such forthright views from a Congress chap..... but, alas you had to show your true colours in the end. I was beginning to wonder if you and that paid lackey of Pakistan, Mani Shankar Iyer, were indeed members of the same party &amp; you confirmed it in the end. Another thing this article proves is that politicians &amp; diplomats are slimy weasels who do not have the slightest qualms in peddling interests not necessarily in sync with national interest. Why, exactly , should India bother about been perceived as intransigent when its concerns on the lack of progress on 26/11 is not addressed? Show some spine, Tharoor , without looking over your shoulder as to what the West thinks about you!
