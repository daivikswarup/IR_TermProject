Headline::::The BJP's Alibis For the Lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq



DateTime::::2015-10-04T11:05:00+05:30




                                Mohammad Akhlaq, 50, had lived his entire life in the village that killed him. His father before him had lived and died in Bisara. Ikram, Akhlaq's widow, remembered filling the tiffin boxes of Hindu neighbours with the mutton she cooked every Id. These neighbours, young men she recognised and named to the police afterwards, broke down her door, dragged out her husband and bludgeoned him to death with bricks. They beat Danish, the dead man's son, to an inch of his life; after two brain surgeries he remains in a coma, fighting for his life. They blackened Danish's grandmother's eyes. A mob of two hundred Hindu men, incited by the village priest, killed a Muslim neighbour and nearly killed his son on the strength of a rumour that they had been eating beef.
This murderous village is a part of Uttar Pradesh, a state ruled by the the Samajwadi Party. Since law and order is a state subject, the Bharatiya Janata Party bears no administrative responsibility for the mayhem. And yet, members of the BJP--local party officials, a Rajya Sabha MP, the union minister of culture--lined up to play down the wickedness and culpability of this lynch mob.This is why the death of Mohammad Akhlaq is more than an individual tragedy. The concerted attempt by responsible members of India's ruling party to minimize the culpability of the killers and the malignant bigotry of the mob, their eagerness to treat the assailants as their political clients merely because they happen to be Hindu, shows us how instinctively majoritarian the BJP is and how little the responsibilities of national office have tempered that reflexive communalism.
So Srichand Sharma the vice-president of the BJP's western UP unit, and Nawab Singh Nagar, former BJP MLA from Dadri told the Indian Express that the killing of Akhlaq was not premeditated or planned. It was provoked by cow-slaughter. In Sharma's words, "there was a clash and in the ensuing fight a man died." A clash. That's one way of describing what happened...if you're a one-eyed sectarian with an axe to grind, but anyone with binocular vision will see a man dragged out of his house and beaten to death as the victim of purposeful murder.
For Nagar, the possibility that Akhlaq and his family had been eating beef was an extenuating circumstance. That and the righteous wrath of provoked Hindus. "This is a village of Thakurs and they express their sentiments in a very strong way." Yes, this hotblooded horde of two hundred warriors was irresistible when it came to roughing up old women, murdering a middle-aged man and nearly killing his son. This, in the BJP's lexicon, is kshatriya valour.
Sharma went on to demand that the charge of murder be withdrawn. He wanted an FIR be lodged against the murdered man's Muslim family for allegedly slaughtering a cow. He threatened to mobilize a mahapanchayat in Bisara to protest against police harassment.
This genius for special pleading isn't limited to the BJP's rank and file. Tarun Vijay, RSS ideologue and BJP MP in the Rajya Sabha, wrote an op-ed in the Indian Express that began with a grotesque misreading of a question posed by Sajida, the dead man's daughter. Responding to the UP police's decision to 'forensically' examine the meat in Akhlaq's refrigerator to determine if it was beef, Sajida asked "If the results prove that it was not beef, will they bring back my dead father?" The desolation and anger behind the rhetorical question was lost on Vijay who chose to read it as a kind of resigned maturity, a refusal to 'politicize' her father's death. For the fanatical operative, everything is grist to the mill; even a daughter's grief can be reworked and pressed into the the service of spin.
The rest of Vijay's piece is a riot of diversionary non sequiturs. What about Tika Lal Taploo? What about cows? What about Dalits? What about Dalit women? On the why and the who of Akhlaq's murder, Vijay had nothing to say except that they shouldn't have killed him on the basis of a rumour.
The men who murdered Akhlaq killed him publicly because the ideological colour of the NDA government and precedents like Muzaffarnagar have fostered a sense of impunity. They knew that powerful, politically-connected men like Nagar, Sharma and Vijay would speak for them. Their local MP, Mahesh Sharma, is the union minister of culture and he rose to the occasion. The killing of Akhlaq, he declared, was an accident. "If someone claims the incident was pre-planned, I completely refute this. What happened was an accident. It is unfortunate." This mealy-mouthed majoritarian will say anything to appease his Hindu constituents. He will even describe a bloody lynching as an accident.
Tireless optimists who expect Mahesh Chandra's boss, the Prime Minister, to intervene in this matter and use the power of his office to reassure Bisara's Muslims of their safety and well-being, will have to wait awhile. During the general election in 2014,  Mr Modi made speeches in Bihar where he re-mixed the BJP's cow-slaughter theme song with a new title, the 'Pink Revolution'. The lyrics of this new version went like this: the UPA government had subsidized cow-slaughter, butchers had grown rich on the back of meat exports...did Yadavs really want to make common cause with people who killed the sacred cow? The BJP has always used the bogey of cow-slaughter for electoral mobilization; targeting Muslims for killing cows has been the blood sport of the majoritarian right for decades now. Given that it worked the last time, why would its leadership fix a moving part with another Bihar election on the horizon?Mukul Kesavan is a writer based in Delhi.

But on such grave matters, not a little squeak out of him. His silence is deafening. PM-ji, if you have finished your self congratulatory trip of USA and UK and Ireland and wherever else you are travelling this week, then please come back home and read the papers and find out whats happening and open your mouth for a worthwhile cause - to reassure millions of Indians that this indeed remains their country and that is has not been taken over by RSS goons who will decide who is Indian and who is not...

Mahesh Sharma holding a responsible Ministry, has to prove his non-partisan credential, otherwise he may be sacked immediately.

For all its great image, and election mandate, it is racial, divisive, crime inciting, irresponsible, unaccountable and unlawful.

                            That the PM has chosen silence is more eloquent than he could have been speaking. The BJP is sending a strong message to its constituents(in Bihar?) that the BJP and its (shadow?)cadres wont tolerate even people rumoured to have slaughtered or facilitated slaughtering of the cow by eating beef.

We need to re-assesses our democratic ideals. Democracy is defined by us. Let us not blame elections and politicians. If we no longer feel safe sending children to schools they attend in villages or riot over fundamental rights, let us not call ourselves free Indians. We are enslaved by ourselves.

                            Right thinking individuals , humanists and people with cosmopolitan and syncretic outlook please be aware that such incidents will never cease and will multiply in geometric proportions going by the defence of the Bisara incident by the members of the ruling BJP. They are being egged on and encouraged by the silence of the Home minister- seems more incompetent than Shivaraj Patil, and the PM, who tweets on every subject whether it is important or unimportant. If an IAS officer commits suicide the Home Minister is in an unseemly haste to get the details but in the case of mob lynching at Bisara not even perfunctory interest seems to have been shown. The society is on way to transformation - seems not for the better

One can foresee a time in the next few years when hate crimes will increase on communal lines. A sad legacy for the future of next generation. It is crystal clear that these repeated incidents have the backing of the PM and his party and affiliates. PM loves self glorification and his rhetoric regarding development. On ground there is no improvement. Under Modi India will lose its eminent position in time to come.

                            The death of Akhlaq Mohammad is sad and a tragedy for his family and all humanity. The perpetrators should be dealt with strongly and punished as per law. However, the question that many people ask of the guardians of secularism is this; where was their secularism when hindus were at the receiving end in many instances of violence (most notably in Kashmir). Another recent case was of chopping off the hand of a Christian in Kerala by fundamentalists. When the guardians of (pseudo) secularism fail to be fair in their condemnation of violence, what message are they conveying?

                            Usually I don't read news on ndtv because I don't belong here, but this news has attracted my attention. I am a Pakistani studying in UK and I am Muslim. Half of my family was divided during India pakistan partition, but I have no hard feelings because past is past. Every year I have numerous close indian friends and most of them are Hindus. We are like a big team of South asians and respect each other as brothers. My Hindu friends are both meat eaters and non meat eaters. They are all very fond of my cooking and always ask me to cook food for them. For my non meat eating friends, I keep special utensils. We never had a slightest conflict because of religion. I don't understand what kind of people will go to the extent to kill some one just because of eating habit. These so called extremist, whether Hindu or Muslim, are our biggest enemy. I believe with this Hindu muslin divide, India will never become a world power. We all have to work together to make South Asia as good as europe. And india will only succeed if there is harmony between all countries and all religions. My dear Hindu brothers and sisters, when you will become a super power, we Muslims of South Asia will be proud of you because we share the same roots. Peace......

                            The Bjp believes it can sail in two boats one development, other communalism. The bjp believes if it can deliver on development, people won't mind killing of one or more minorities here and there. This would keep the animal instinct of the right wing happy. But they live in a fools paradise, a government which sustains on hate would always to have find new enemies for holding on to power.You can't have double digit growth if your nation is divided.

                            So tell me mukul.. I read this headline today morning too.. 'In a Bareilly Village, Muslim Father Allegedly Kills 6-Year-Old Girl For Not Covering Her Head'. Why dont you write an article on that too? Oh wait you cant! Because the muslims will lynch you in public or some terrorist will walk into your house with a bomb strapped on him. And ofcourse, you are secular, and to be secular in india means to abominate hinduism and support every other minority blindly. That also makes you one of the elites, doesnt it? Bashing hinduism in any form? Now am no way justifying what the mob did. Killing someone for allegedly eating beef is barbarian. But i see that everytime some minir thing happens to a minority community, the whole country goes crazy, but the hindus are just taken for granted. This has gone to ridiculous levels m, which is why these days, people have gotten so frustrated that they dont mind a communal government at the centre. At least, they are pro-development. You cant deny that!

                            no one shows reality of attack on Hindus in WestBengal and kerela. Wht abt Kashmiri Pandits? No Media sympathy for them. Here one person got killed in brawl and its being given a color as if all muslims are in danger and sm hw BJP behind this when it happened in UP where mulla-yum rules.

                            Ridiculous for the author to point at BJP/Modi and it shows his innate hate towards them! This is the time that we all Indians should be united in condemning it and be peaceful. Let the investigations be carried and exemplary punishment be given to culprits. Irresponsibily taking the names of political parties/organizations and inferring in their own language is as dangerous as the mob which performed the heinous act. Nowadays it has become a fashion for the writers or authors to take this route to gain attention &amp; fame!

                            Well written. A "cow" ignorant that it is, is the cause of so much hurt and division in our society. And the reason for this sad state of affairs is not the cow, but rather people who have made this "creature" as their "creator" (god). A cow is an useful animal, no doubt. But so is a goat or a sheep or a pig or a camel. I am unable to comprehend how people can make an animal as their "god". And further, how they can impose their beliefs on others. While the PM barks about "Digital India" his supporters are taking India to the dark ages! Looking at all the violence by radical-Hindu groups I am drawn to conclude that they are no different from ISIS. And the world needs to take notice of it.....

                            India is a backward country and its society is afflicted with unreason. The hindu extremists represented by the RSS and its affiliates have organisational cells all over the country. Their modus operandi is to heat the pot of a hindu communal nationalism and inculcate a sense irredentist revivalism in the majority community thereby securing a vote bank to derive benefit at elections. The forces of secularism and progress must log and expose these operative cells up and down the country but do they have the resources and support to do so. That is the moot point. These hindu extremists are deeply embedded in the state.

But this in no way reflects anything Hindureligion related, A religion which allowed all other religions worldwide to come and make India their home. Everytime the media uses Hindu vagabonds or Hindu terrorists, am I supposed to be ashamed of my own identity. The very same headlines in the media is the reason that a so called hindu vote bank is being created and voting bloc is consolidating.

                            its extremely troubling and unfortunate to read this and this act needs to be condemned unequivocally. also the accused need to be brought to justice and hanged if law stipulates. hinduism goes beyond tolerance and plurality. what makes it truly genuine is its ability to stand apart from other religions and to tug at others conscience, show its uniqueness without trying too hard through godmen or scriptures merely by following the path of live and let live, not just with fellow humans but all living animals alike. Killing of any innocent animal and not just a cow, no matter how reprehensible, needs to be avenged by hurting the conscience, the psyche of the perpetrator by making them see the heniousness of the crime for it obviously is... physical hurt or killing might evoke a sense of fear of retaliation and hence, forced abstinence but it would neither have a lasting impact nor the required spread not just among muslims but among non believing hindus as well.

                            An act of valor by a horde of 200 brave warriors who displayed extreme courage while consciously facing imminent peril from an evil beef eating demon. Those who malign these fine young gentlemen by crying hoarse over an irrelevant judicial system are delusional fanatics and human rights abuse cases will be filed against them. Kudos to the cops for displaying such exemplary courage and acting swiftly to round up the most crucial piece of incriminating evidence (read holy cows remains from the refrigerator) for forensic evidence. Some may be waiting to hear what came out of it but that is so besides the point. For the ones questioning police response,  rumor has it that justice may still be served, irrespective of the beef eating claims being substantiated and that the comatose son could be dragged from his hospital bed and sent to the gallows. After all how dare he. All the neighbors who took no part in this religious cleansing will be marked as not being thankful for the elder sons service. Last but not the least, heartfelt congratulations to the author for the customary modi bashing. So customary in such a riveting tail of a secular countries national pride.

                            Extremely sad and dastardly act by local goons. This happens when law enforcers are dumb &amp; inept. Even if the family has eaten beef, this was to be reported to be taken up as per existing law. On the other hand, pleasing religious groups has long been a staple of indian politics and all we see today is a only consequence. If we do not stop this by discussions among communities (and this is the duty of the governments to promote such discussions ) our future is very bleak

                            Who knows if this is not a game plan of SP to tarnish Hindu image. A small spark is enough for mob to react. Someone has initiated this spark

                            The question really is "why is beef banned in UP". The moment you come up with a stupid law, you are bound to have people abusing it. So why is any political party at fault. Why can't the govt of UP take some serious steps in getting the culprits to justice. Why drag bjp into each and every negative news in india. I am not supporting bjp in any way but I  not seeing any balanced comments.

                            Don't spread rumors. Not only Hindus basically Muslims are also responsible. Stop beef eating in India. I hope you will never die

                            Kesevan putting his twist to a news report that has been regurgitated many times before.  Kesevan adds no value to what is admittedly horrific news.  We the ordinary Indians condemn outright the barbarity committed against the Aklaq family.  However, what is more condemnable is the act of a vulture like Kesevan in picking this happening to write this totally unnecessary article.

                            This is turning out like the church 'attacks' in New Delhi where all blame was aportioned to the BJP/RSS and much to all surprise the investigations proved nothing! This beef ban business is all about sullying the BJP name with the forth coming Bihar elections in mind. An innocent man has lost his life because of politics

                            This is the problem with the Congress and its leaders. If there is a communal incident blame the culprit (some 200 Hiindus, as stated by him). Instead they start blaming the BJP which results in acrimony between the two biggest political parties and the common man does not get any relief. Either party wants votes and for this individuals are scapegoats! And this resignation will only help the communal elements of all hues.<br/>
By the way, have congress taken up similar issue when the victim of communal tension was a Hindu. If they take up such cases they would not have lost elections and BJP would not have grown to this level.

                            Damn article is full of bias... So bloody in appeasing mode, yes agreed death of an innocent man in the name of eating beef is saddening, but the bloody media should refrain from taking sides and focus the issue to get the culprits charged and jailed, instead for invoking and continue to hurt the sentiments of of those concerned. The media should report incidents in a balanced mode rather than taking sides and inciting hatred...
