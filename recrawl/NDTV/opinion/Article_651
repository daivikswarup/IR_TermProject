Headline::::Myanmar Operation Strengthens PM Modi's No-Nonsense Reputation



DateTime::::2015-06-10T21:44:00+05:30




                                There are those who have described the Indian Army's operations against cross-border insurgency groups hiding in villages in Myanmar as dramatic and new. There are others who have pointed out that such operations have been conducted before - in Myanmar itself and famously in Bhutan, against the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) and other militant groups in 2003. In a sense, both are right.
 
True, such operations have taken place earlier, but rarely has the speed of execution been so swift and the political will been so determined and cold-blooded. The recent operation took place barely a week after Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang) or NSCN(K) and affiliated units ambushed and killed Indian soldiers in Manipur. The response, both a punitive as well as pre-emptive strike after information had been received of further attacks, was quick. No doubt it will send a message.
 
The army and intelligence agencies can provide the inputs and menu of options, but in the end such operations require a political call. The risk lies substantially with the political leadership. If the operation had gone wrong, if Indian troops had suffered extraordinary casualties or if a diplomatic incident had occurred, it was for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to carry the can.
 
While not comparable in logistical scale, two American special ops come to mind. The first was the 1980 rescue mission mounted by Special Forces attempting to evacuate diplomats being held hostage at the United States embassy in Teheran. It went horribly wrong, with a helicopter crash resulting in the death of American troops. This fiasco contributed to President Jimmy Carter's defeat later that year, as he sought re-election. A quarter-century on, President Barack Obama put his political credibility at stake when he approved the raid on Osama Bin Laden's hideout in Abbottabad. Fortunately for him, it was successful.
 
To be fair, the Indian ops in the border regions of Myanmar were that much easier. A degree of comfort and military cooperation with the generals and the politicians in Myanmar has been achieved over the past 15 odd years, since Jaswant Singh, as foreign minister, flew to Myanmar for a breakthrough visit in 2001. This was built on in the UPA decade, and further consolidated by the Narendra Modi government in the past year.
 
Having said that, the decision to move in and move so decisively was ultimately that of the prime minister. The fact that the mission achieved its goals will strengthen Modi's no-nonsense reputation. Seen alongside the tough - and in purely military terms even disproportionate - response to Pakistani incursions in the summer of 2014, it will reinforce the message that if and when challenged, Modi's government will do its utmost to impose costs on the challenger.
 
Yet, one needs to be cautious in pronouncing that this is a new, all-purpose security and counter-insurgency/counter-terrorism doctrine for every eventuality, circumstance and geography. In the case of Pakistan and the Kashmir theatre, for example, things will not be as simple. Indian security forces have occasionally crossed the Line of Control (LoC) for short, daring missions to neutralise a target or pursue a hardened foe. A spell of such moves took place during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, for instance, and was monitored by the Prime Minister's Office. There have probably been other such moments, but understandably they have remained below the radar.
 
In the case of hitting militants or terror units across the LoC, Indian forces will not be assured of support or even neutrality from Pakistani authorities. That aside, even if some camps or militant facilities exist close to the LoC, in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, they may have only transient, tactical value. The strategic locations that truly threaten India are far deeper in Pakistani territory, in the heartland and the urban centres of Punjab.
 
An assault on these is entirely different from an assault on hamlets in border regions. It will require the meticulous creation and nurturing of assets inside Pakistan that may well be on National Security Adviser Ajit Doval's long-term agenda but will take years to do.
 
The biggest plus from the Myanmar operation will be the boost it has given the Indian army and intelligence agencies. A big and difficult mission, involving immaculate matching of actionable intelligence and precise delivery, has been accomplished. The political leadership has given the army the necessary cover to push ahead. This is the way of confident nations.(The author is senior fellow, Observer Research Foundation.

                            A military response was swift, telling and henceforth will be certain.  Had Pappu won the election, under advise from Mani the moron Shankar Aiyar, he would have held uninterrupted and uninterruptable talks with the terrorists, advised the terrorists that he would enable them to get information under RTI, promised them women empowerment and also promised to change the structure of the political parties.  He would then have buggered off on a vipasana, gone to see girlfriend Veronique in Venezuela, perhaps without his suit and boots, given Vadra a few more plum land deals and then, when the next attack followed, would have blamed Modi!

"Myanmar will not accept any foreigner who attacks neighbouring countries in the back and creates problems by using our own territory," he added.<br/><br/>

                            In view of the whole episode and co-operation by Myammar, it was just an operation in 'extended area'.  This was  duty of the govt. but what are the real issues suicide by farmers, no creation of jobs, rising prices of pulses, crashing stock market. My fear if govt. fails our soldiers will have to face war with either Pakistan or China to make us feel good

                            I read the report that Myanmar army is denying that Indian army carried surgical operations in their border. Even if Indian army carried away operations in Myanmar border with their army co-operation, it was very childish and amateur by Indian govt to pulicize this operation. It will not be surprising if Myanmar army will be reluctant in co-operating with Indian army in future, because no sovereign country wants other countries to carry over operation on their soil and they have to answer their own people. Unfortunately our govt is putting a lot of effort on PR campaign and strengthening its position politically in India . I wish they take pragmatic approach when it comes to border security. <br/><br/>
Coming to this article, Mr. Ashok Malik comes in the same league as Swapan Dasgupta and Madhu Kishwar Dutt. Even BJP spokesperson may feel embarrassed when they see these journalist defending our PM.

                            At last a leader acting the way when a great nation like ours is challenged by thugs however small or big they may be, and internally or externally. This along with our defense policy and investments made - renewal of equipments - sends a strong signal to nations surrounding us. India is a secular and democratic nation but when attacked we have the responsibility to defend ourselves... Let's get rid of all this mess then we will be able to concentrate on the upheaval of our masses!!! Kudos Prime Minister

                            The trafficking of narcotics make the international drug lords fabulously wealthy. Most of the militant outfits in the northeast are  their agents, just money-making enterprises.   They make artificial famine by scuttling the supply chain of grains, which creates dissent against Indian government. The Apathy shown by the central government to the population suffering from a famine had created more militant groups in the past. Most of the militant groups can hardly claim to represent the tribal population. The reports from these states show a show high numbers of HIV-related diseases. The Golden Triangle in Burma is second to Afghanistan in opium production. Not sure about the role of Myanmar govt in opium cultivation. The poppy fields in the mountainous  interior regions are the principal source of opium. The militant use the intermittent ceasefire with the Myanmar government to operate freely across the border.

The roads, etc must be sanitized and no prior information should be leaked anywhere of the troop movements. Govt departments should act themselves on such matters to protect our soldiers by taking such precautions.

                            Like many others have noted here, show of power against week nations that nether Russia nor USA wants is not really a change in stance by any measure. I don't think anyone would start looking at India differently than they have so far. This is more of a PR stunt than anything else. Army has done many of such operations on the past irrespective who the Govt. was. A real show would be to take a tough stand against terrorist coming from Pakistan.<br/><br/>
Look at this way. They ambushed an Army convoy and not killed civilians. Now, did the jawans that died do anything to harm these so called terrorist personally? I would not like to believe so. We will have to accept that AFSPA has weaknesses and look at how and why these people are turning against the Army.
