Headline::::Ram Madhav and The Akhand Bharat Controversy



DateTime::::2015-12-28T16:42:00+05:30




                                BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav's comments on the concept of "Akhand Bharat" (Composite India) in an interview to Al Jazeera channel have triggered some debate and controversy. What is this all about and, frankly, despite Madhav's personal beliefs, how is it politically relevant at all in these times?
The idea of an undivided, composite Indian civilisational territory being threatened became current in the 1940s as a reaction to calls for a separate Muslim homeland. In the emotional upheaval of the moment, which extended into the early years after Partition, the slogan of "Akhand Bharat" had many takers, not necessarily limited to the RSS and the refugee communities, from Sindh, West Punjab and East Bengal, that had to migrate from their ancestral homes to a new location in free India. There is some evidence that even Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel believed Partition was temporary and Pakistan was unviable.
Seventy years on, history has provided sobering lessons. While it is true that many in the early 1950s didn't quite know how Partition would pan out - leading to the millenarian call for an Akhand Bharat and other similar responses - it is clear today that India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have emerged as three separate nation-states with different identities and destinies. To interrogate the inviolability of those national borders is pointless. If nothing else, it gets the smaller countries worried that the big neighbour is questioning their right to exist.
When he travelled to Lahore as prime minister in 1999, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was careful to go to the Minar-a-Pakistan, built on the location of the Lahore Resolution, adopted by the Muslim League in 1940, that formally called for a Muslim homeland to be carved out of British India. This gesture was Vajpayee's attempt to bury the ghosts of the past, and stress that even he - a right-of-centre politician with an RSS and BJP background - was completely reconciled to Pakistan's distinct identity and nation-statehood.
It is another matter that some Islamist bigots in Pakistan sought to "purify" the Minar-e-Pakistan shortly after Vajpayee's visit, claiming it had been desecrated by a Hindu and an Indian.
Separate political identities should not and must not come in the way of emphasising the shared cultural legacies of the countries that make up the sub-continent, or South Asia if you prefer. Some of these legacies are rooted in an ethos that is decidedly pre-Islamic and can only be described as Hindu. Take for example the 52 Shakti Peeths - the shrines to the Mother Goddess Sati - that have been places of worship since ancient times. The easternmost of these is Kamakhya, in Guwahati, Assam, to the east of Bangladesh. The westernmost is the Hinglaj Mata temple, in Balochistan.
Yet, to hark back to some ancient and supposedly nativist idea of the subcontinent is both unrealistic and unfair. As Nehru so beautifully put it in The Discovery of India, India is "an ancient palimpsest on which layer upon layer of thought and reverie had been inscribed, and yet no succeeding layer had completely hidden or erased what had been written previously". That is why not just Hindu shrines, but Buddhist monuments, the Muslim cultures of the medieval era and even the impact of the British colonial epoch are a part of our shared heritage. To deny any one of these is to deny (part of) our history.
As such, those in Pakistan who pretend their country has no history before Muhammad bin Qasim invaded Sindh or that Ranjit Singh didn't leave his imprint on Lahore are ever going to be regarded as a fringe, however large their number. To be honest, that Peshawar is a part of Pakistan and not Afghanistan is entirely due to the Sikh conquest of the city from the Afghans in the early 19th century. Of course, it needs to be said that the increasing and intensifying Islamist tendencies in Pakistan's polity make such a compatibility with Pakistan's non-Muslim history decidedly difficult.
In India too, the loose and rhetorical references to "1,200 years of occupation" are better avoided, especially by those in government, and ultimately serve no purpose. They are not the appropriate mechanism to build a composite, plural and modern identity. Also, if one decides to go back to an "untainted" period, how far does one go? Among India's greatest emperors was Kanishka, a Buddhist who ran the Kushan Empire in the second century. His empire extended from modern Xinjiang (western China), covered today's Afghanistan and Pakistan, and ended in the plains close to contemporary Delhi. Should this then become the negotiating basis for reunification of Akhand Bharat?
Civilisations are defined by common identity markers and forms of worship. They survive, however, due to the flourishing of trade and commerce. That is why, to take a random example, the Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu, was both a place of worship and a sort of "departure terminal", from where merchant ships got permission to leave on trading missions to Southeast Asia - part of India's sphere of influence and, by a leap of logic, as likely to form part of Greater India and Akhand Bharat as, say, Balochistan.
The subcontinent could have lived with the divisions and territorial cleavages of 1947. What really hurt it was the destruction of an age-old and organic trading system, one that saw Myanmar as the rice bowl of South Asia and fruits from the Northwest Frontier making it to Bombay (now Mumbai) by the Frontier Mail and being sold in markets there. Any updated version of Akhand Bharat cannot but aim to reconstruct that trading system - one where national boundaries may well be sacrosanct but energy corridors, river-development projects and expressways would cross these boundaries at will.
To look upon Greater India - the basis for Akhand Bharat if you will - exclusively in territorial or continental terms is decidedly limiting. It has a strong maritime component, a gift of the sea-faring nature of our ancestors. It was George Nathaniel Curzon who as viceroy over 100 years ago described the strategic frontiers of India as extending from the Straits of Malacca to the Gulf of Aden. Elements of such thinking continue to motivate India's emerging 21st century Indian Ocean doctrine.
Does this make Curzon, or Kanishka some 2,000 years before him - not to speak of the Mauryas and the Cholas and the Mughals, all of whom managed vast subcontinental or transoceanic empires - only one of many available models of Akhand Bharatiyas?(The author is senior fellow, Observer Research Foundation.

                            Ram Madhav should keep his fantasies to himself. His party did not put 'Akhand Bharat' to any test of the people's will 's in the 2014 elections.<br/><br/>
Why does he forget what his party actually promised? Have they already given up on "Achhe Din"?<br/><br/>
Ram will do well to remember a certain 20th century Leader whose fantastical dreams of "Lebensraum" ultimately ended in the destruction of Germany.

                            Even as national identities can remain, the concept of Akhand Barat is a great means to unity. Just like how the european union operates, Akhand Barat can offer a great platform for trade and financial empowerment of a deprived people for so long.

                            Well articulated. Additionally, we as a nation, are unable to even manage what is today India. 100% of govt employees are corrupt, 90% of police is super corrupt, much of the judges are available at the right price. Dear Ram Madhav, stop drinking, start working. We gave you the mandate to bring about a change and that change isn't coming. We don't want the Congress style of working. Change this corrupt system. This is the legacy that BJP should try to achieve. We don't want another stupid Manmohan Singh as our leader. Wake up, and work.

The economic benefits will be immense for all countries. But despite better homogenous social value than EU, extreme political differences in SAARC makes this goal unachievable.

                            Nature has given us so much richness but still we are beggar and will remain like that because of our beggar mentality. Bharat was Akhand but we break it down to maintain some perks for Kings and Jamindars. In 1857 we fight united but in 1947 we ask for Muslim Rashtra, we ask for Hindu Rashtra and we ignite the religious flavor to obtain it. In results of that we ask King of Kashmir and Nepal not to merge with Bharat and further divided ourselves. We are not still satisfied with this partition and our deeds are asking it more. In general, prosperity never comes at the door of a beggar because he or she could not think beyond own needs like an animal. Somewhere, we have to generate some maturity in ourselves to think that we can achieve or maintain our prosperity only when our neighbor also becomes prosperous. We can certainly fight to go to haven but its loneliness will become hell for us. Thus, it is highly essential that we must collectively work to make Bharat a socialist republic rather than a broken Akhand.

                            In my view there was no controversy. Mehdi Hassan asked a pointed question about RSS's philosophy of Akhand Bharat to which Ram Madhav provided a straight reply. He also specifically said it could only come about through popular goodwill and not through war. The interview is available on youtube<br/>
Was there an expectation that an RSS ideologue would actually step back from a well known position that his parent organization is known to take on this issue? In my view this is just a manufactured controversy as is the controversy on intolerance that arises from media's interviews of less than articulate BJP members

                            one geo economic region extending from afghanistan to burma and leh to maldives - will only result in more prosperity, peace and cultural development for the coming generations. those kids learning to read and write now ... have this enormous task to write the constitution of such co-operative region so that its people become stronger and compete freely within the developing dynamic world. It constitutes the future of 1/4th of humanity. Enough with the political borders, religious divide and small mind attitude. If you are not happy with AKHAND BHARAT - Just call it South Asia Economic Region. But the Idea of Strength in Unity is not totally nonsense - as a matter of fact, by keeping each country small, we reduce the potential of each individual. An example: any American artist or businessman  has the highest potential  in the world only because of the country being so homogenous and its economy so huge - not so in Europe / Japan / or any other country. So you choose if you want to be a citizen of a small country or a country which is the part of a vast economically homogenous region - the option should be made available to everybody and the action plan needs to be taken at all levels.  And this is not rocket science.

                            To the Author,<br/><br/>
I did not read the entire article. I stopped at the word controversy itself. Why should there be any? It is us Hindus [please refer to this word as a regional identification as given to us by the Arabs] who had to give away our land to those Muslims who consider to be descendants of looters, rapists, intolerant religious bigots who cannot live with their brothers and sisters with whom they share their roots. What Ram M said was nothing but a wish that Hindus who converted to the Arabic religion for gain, or fear of death etc will one day realize that, I can have foreign adopted religion, but my culture, my roots are vedic. Thus, with this revelation, one day Akhand Bharat will be a reality. <br/><br/>
Besides as far as the host of the program is concerned, he had an agenda and narrative was well placed to fulfill the agenda. RamM fell for it. Lets not make a Jihadi apologist in closet be a toast of the town. Plainly speaking, he is a moron who believes in flying horses but will call me a kuffur cattle cause I believe in Ram and unification of people of vedic roots.<br/><br/>
How can this be a controversy? All the smart intellectuals must be reminded of one fact, borders change every 20-30 years or so. History is witness to this. Now I'll finish reading your article<br/><br/>
Thx.

                            Akhanda Bharat may be possible in distant future. But definitely not under the hegemony of Hindutva forces. It is only by raising above communal divisions and recognizing the equality of all nations and ethnic communities in the sub-continent that we can think of unity.

                            English educated modern Indian did untold damage to Indian Civilization following the Englishmen's Macaulay stratagem; today's corrupt India is a direct outcome of that 'miswork'. Still worse, modern Indians' 'cultural condition' has been deteriorating all along. I wonder at their ignorance of India's civilizational stakes. The West is on its way out- the waning of empires is no news. Pakistan and Bangladesh are though back wind to the West's hegemony's sails; they coolly carry on with their Veto diktat over rest humanity. The only challenge to that 'imperium' is a strong India for reasons of its subcontinental size, an enduring Vedic civilization however dormant- held so by India's 'Macaulayed class', and some critical factors more. Modern Indians are little knowledge is a dangerous thing thing. They are a far cry from Chanakya, or for that matter Vivekananda. These people suffered upon them a dyarchy of de jure and a de facto Prime Minister. They were fooled! Still they think they know. Oh no! They don't know that they don't know. I watch modern Media from our nation's wings. I pour scorn over their 'bird brains'. Big brains is the need, and those big brains see in subcontinent's unity the promise of next millenniums. Ah! Why shall I cast pearls before swines? Yet I did for the odd chance that the odd soul catches on to the spur to foresee future and work for it- just as I do, nose at my modest Redeeming India mill.
