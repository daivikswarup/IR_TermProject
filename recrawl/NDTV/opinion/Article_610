Headline::::What Hardik Patel Has Misunderstood



DateTime::::2015-10-12T03:28:00+05:30




                                The Patels in Gujarat rallying for reservation under Hardik Patel's leadership raises many questions. The first and foremost is: why in Gujarat? Government jobs may well be a big deal in economically backward parts of the country - say, UP or Bihar. But in terms of the growth rate of per capita income, Gujarat has been among the very top of Indian states in the last decade and a half, earning Narendra Modi the title of Vikas Purush and generating nation-wide buzz about the Gujarat model.
Now it is true that some of the social and human development indices in Gujarat are not in line with its rank in terms of the level and growth rate of average incomes as noted in the 2013 report of the Raghuram Rajan committee. Still, Gujarat is indeed top ranked among Indian states in terms of ease of doing business or economic freedom, justifying its image of a business-friendly state.  
What the Patel agitation underscores is the fact that economic growth in Gujarat did not translate into sufficient employment growth. Between 2004-05 and 2009-10, for example, while the country overall experienced a small growth in total employment, Gujarat experienced a net decline, according to the NSSO. A major driver behind Gujarat's impressive industrial growth is the expansion of capital-intensive sectors (e.g., petroleum refining), which do not fuel job growth in the same way as more labour-intensive sectors. Resentment against reservation of seats for socially under-privileged groups in Gujarat is an outgrowth of this phenomenon of jobless growth.  
However, introducing reservation for the Patels or any other group for that matter will hardly solve their problem of unemployment. Given the size of the Indian economy, the reach of the reservation system is fairly limited. The number of government jobs that become available every year is around a meagre 1% of the total number of registered educated unemployed in the country. Just a few weeks ago, 368 job openings for peons in UP resulted in 23 lakh applications, of which 1.5 lakhs were from college graduates, some of them engineers and PhDs. Also, merely 20% of India's total population in the 18+age bracket is enrolled in some higher education institution, private or public. The overall impact of reservations on average educational and economic outcomes is thus bound to be limited to a relatively small segment of the population.
Those who drafted our reservation policies were aware of this. For them, reservation was a necessary step to strengthen the representation of disadvantaged groups in the arena of administrative power. This, they hoped, would make the state machinery more sensitive to the needs of these groups and they, in turn, would feel empowered through a sense of participation in the governance of the country. So, the main objectives of reservation policies in India are the social and political upliftment of the average member of backward castes (SCs, STs, and OBCs, who together constitute approximately two-thirds of the total population). Of course, it was expected that some of these benefits would trickle down in the form of economic progress of these groups as well.   
All studies show that the backward castes are significantly behind the higher castes in terms of education, employment, and economic status. However, one could argue that is because they have been historically poor, and social backwardness is really a reflection of economic backwardness. After all, there is poverty among forward castes too. Which is why many, including Hardik Patel, argue that reservation should be economic class-based, not caste-based.
The problem with this argument is that it denies social discrimination completely. Two individuals of similar economic status do not always have the same access to opportunities in a society where caste prejudice runs deep.
Everyday there are news stories about Dalits facing various forms of social discrimination. For example, a 12-year-old Dalit boy in Jodhpur was recently beaten up by a teacher for touching a plate meant for upper castes during the mid-day meal at his school, causing dozens of other Dalit students from his village to stay away from school in fear. Leaving aside grim news items, research on intergenerational mobility shows that if two generations are compared in terms of education, employment and prosperity (e.g., if the father is less educated what is the probability that the child will be highly educated), economic mobility within the higher castes has historically been much greater than within the lower castes. So saying "why not reservations on economic criteria only" denies the reality of caste-based discrimination and the fact that social identities - and not just economic factors - govern the prospect of upward mobility.
At the same time, some inherent limitations of the reservation policy cannot be overlooked. There is an innate tension between the long-term goal of removing caste-based discrimination, and perpetuating a policy based on caste itself. In implementing this policy, the eligibility criteria for disadvantaged castes are often set lower than those for the general category, which perpetuates the 'backward' tag of these groups. It also creates resentment among those who are economically backward among the forward castes, since it is hard to quantify and compare the disadvantages created by social and economic handicaps. Sensible adjustments can be made to balance between these two types of handicap, which often but not always go together. One would be to limit the benefits of reservation to one or two generations of the same family.  Another would be to give priority to the economically backward members of socially backward groups.
It has to be admitted that the overall effectiveness of the policy of reservations has been limited. The representation of the backward castes in top administrative posts remains as low as 23% in 2011 - after many decades of reservation - though they constitute two-thirds of the whole population. Some could argue this means the percentage of reservation should be increased even further. But in the case of education and jobs, it is often difficult to find enough eligible candidates from these groups,and more often than not the reserved seats lie vacant.
The studies on inter-generational mobility mentioned earlier reveal one silver lining though. It appears that in the last two decades, economic mobility within the lower castes has improved considerably, and is now comparable with mobility within the upper castes. The likely reason for this is the expansion of opportunities in the private sector, both educational and job-related, as a result of economic reforms. After all, since the early 80s, total employment has not changed much in the public sector, but has gone up by more than 60% in the organized private sector. Hence, politically empowering the backward castes through reservations, and increasing their economic mobility through economic reforms and job-creation can actually complement each other.
Without substantial economic reforms, and job growth some of the old fault lines in the country's social and economic terrain are bound to open up. The movement against reservations in Gujarat is a symptom of this.(Maitreesh Ghatak is Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics, and his main area of research is development economics.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

One only have to look at Modiji's administrators. Disproportionate number of them are upper caste/Brahmin. That is a tell tale of what ails this country.<br/><br/>
Also, like political dynasties, administrative dynasties run deep too. Ajit dovals's son and foreign secretary jaishankar's son   both are part of 'think tanks' that Modiji listens to..  So it is all an upper caste clique.

                            Government provide 1% of total job in reservation. It is impossible to bring upliftment of backwards who comprise two third of population of India, by 1% job. Defence  and public sector like railway don't give reservation. I think development of suppressed can be better addressed by over all inclusive development of India.

                            Before journalists make comments about the prosperity of Patels, should visit rural Gujarat or probably rural Saurashtra and see the poverty for themselves. Patels of Saurashtra have done well if they or their families have migrated because farming in Saurashtra only provided a hand to mouth living because even drinking water is scarce or was until the Narbada waters helped.<br/><br/>
Just because 5% or less of the population migrated because they were forced to and got rich should not deprive the other 95% or so of opportunities that are stolen away from them in the name of reservation.<br/><br/>
It is interesting that the media makes lofty claims of how rich the Patels are and none will tour rural Saurashtra to see how badly the Patels are doing. And why look down upon people who are hard working and enterprising.<br/><br/>
Also it is interesting that Modi talks of emergency and the murder of democracy. That was in 1977. The world has evolved since then and we still had the terrible incidents of police beatings in 2015 Gujarat where not even one police man has been suspended or jailed even though they have performed ex-judicial beatings on video.<br/><br/>
Modi has been quite about this. It just shows that whether it is Congress or BJP, democracy is still the same no matter if it is 1977 or 2015. The ones in power will only point fingers but do the same: MURDER DEMOCRACY and get away with it. Even in  Pakistan, dictators are tried and hanged.

                            Reservation itself is not the problem, provided all deserving candidates are accommodated, which is possible if we spend more on education and increase seats like Delhi government is doing. On contrary central government has hugely cut education budget  which is the most regressive step and will take country backwards and prolong the demand of reservation.

                            Dear sir, you do raise some valid points but please also analyse that the major benefit of reservation in present times is taken up by the children of those who have utilised it once. The incidence you put forth of boy touching plate and getting beaten up is only because the father of the child is not empowered. Will the teacher in question treat a son of high government officer in the same way? No, therefore don't you think some rationalisation regarding reservation policy is need of the day?

                            Hardik patel has a different agenda and using reservation as an excuse. Either this is an attempt to force a rethink on reservations or this is just to create a feeling of discontent amongst the patels against the modi government.

                            Just because Dalits are facing discrimination does not justify a reservation system where opportunities are taken away from those deserving. It is now turning out to be a crime to be born in an upper caste poor family. The reservation policy is only making poor of the more deserving child by robbing him/her of opportunities and handing them over to those of the reservation classes.

                            Probably Prof. Ghatak doesn't understand the points, not Hardik.<br/>
1. Hardik wants attention, not reservation. Hardik is better analyzed by psychologists rather than sociologists. Even Patel leaders in favor of reservations have reservations about Hardik. Patels don't need jobs, they don't want jobs either. They need admissions to colleges at affordable rates - probably. That is affordable by Patel standards. In Gujarati society, since at least Solanki period, it is a stigma to work for salary. The professor doesn't understand Gujjus and/or Patels.<br/>
2. Gujarat actually faces acute labor shortage unlike what the professor talks about. In forest resorts of Gujarat, there is labor from Orissa and Maharashtra because locals are busy doing other things. The maid (baai) castes have seen steady decline in last 40 years from upper caste/Muslim widows to Patels to OBC to SC/STs - now to Nepalis. Construction labor has been Tamil for last 40 years. Diamond is shared between Oriyas and Gujjus. Ship breaking - Biharis. Gold/silver ornament making - Bengalis. Farming - Rajasthanis and MPítes. Engineering labor - Oriyas. Soon, all Oriyas will be in Gujarat. <br/>
3. That leads to simple conclusion is that Hardik is a mask. Someone else is acting behind him.

                            Brilliantly argued, Mr Maitreesh Ghatak. Of the two very good solutions suggested, this one: "Give priority to the economically backward members of socially backward groups" could be really effective towards creating equal distribution to both the economically backward among SC-ST-OBCs as well as the economically backward among the 'higher castes'.

                            Dear Sir - socialism is not yet gone and cannot go from this world completely...it is necessitated to have equity in Indian society...most govt jobs do not pay more than 2lakh rupees per annum whereas hundreds and thousands of executives in many private Indian firms are making &gt; 100 crore bucks every year without doing much...if you look into the activities and achievments of those executives you wd find they need to lie a lot and do not deserve most of their earnings...obviously this will give rise to discontentment that in turn will create many Hardik Patels in the country...if we are to carry on with democratic capitalism we need to increase attention on corporate socialism so that no one in the country is treated a bigger than life character and allowed to flex political muscles !!

                            "....But in the case of education and jobs, it is often difficult to find enough eligible candidates from these groups,and more often than not the reserved seats lie vacant."<br/><br/>
The above statement is wrong...though that's official reason to keep reserved seats vacant. Actually, it is intentionally kept vacant. For example, one govt dept requires to recruit 100 employees (say 15 sc, 7 sc, 27 obc and 51 general). But they will publish requirement of 120 (18 sc, 8 st, 34 obc and 60 general). At final stage, the dept recruits 11 sc, 4 st, 25 obc and 60 genera, total 100 (original requirement fulfilled). In this case, vacant reserved seats are 7 sc, 4 st and 9 obc. <br/><br/>
Reservation is not 100% effective. I think, reservation is fully followed only into educational institutes.

                            The jobless growth is a problem world-wide. India has been lucky in software and services so far. Otherwise every industry tries to do with greater automation and fewer people. You need industries like 3D printing, art and craft which need custom products and creative solutions. Organic farming is yet another area. The law and order, health sector, education and social service are under served so is infrastructure builing. All these sectors get caught in corruption and red tape.

                            Respected Sir,<br/>
                I agree with your point of view regarding reservation. It is completely misguiding to put a poor Brahmin and a poor dalit at par. However, I am not convinced at all that economic reform would necessarily generate job- which is quite clear by the term you have used yourself-"jobless growth" ; many are also using the term "job-loss growth". Is not Gujarat example justify that?Again the quality of job, i.e. whether the minimum wage laws are being maintained or not, and whether other benefits are being provided to the employee by the employer is  a serious issue.SCs/STs and OBCs are mostly victims of such irregularities. Unfortunately these issues are avoided by the mainstream economists. Again job share of the SCs /STs and OBCs in the private organization needs to be discussed more elaborately.<br/>
 Apart from this I would like to raise a question- How justified it is to discuss the fall out(positive or negative) of economic reform naively ( that is without considering the development or backward movement of the pre reform era)?

                            When reservation was introduced for SC/ST the main sufferer were BCs, as the jobs share which were going to them were taken away by SC/STs. Forward castes remain largely unaffected. Now on extending reservations to BCs, the castes which are "Not Very Forward (NVF castes)" among forward castes are not getting any chance in employment. The most forward castes are taking most of share in  the reduced cake; such caste were holding lands 60 years back now as they got multiplied their holdings have gone down to below sustainable level /landless moreover such caste do not have any hereditary profession to fall-back as  alternative . The solution is to make BC list dynamic and revised every five if not every alternate year by caste based census not by surveys. Now even many SC/ST castes are well represented in Govt. jobs especially in class 4, 3, 2.
