Headline::::Will Your Cellphone Bills Increase? The Impact of Spectrum Auction



DateTime::::2015-04-01T15:38:00+05:30



(MK Venu is Executive Editor of Amar Ujala publications group)
	The importance of telecom services in the consumption basket of over half a billion Indians is generally underestimated. Ask the largely self-employed migrant workers in big cities or small towns, and they will tell you how mobile bills constitute around 6% to 8% of their monthly consumption expenditure. This is by no means a small amount. So when Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad stated in a press conference last week that the " most successful telecom spectrum auctions in history" would fetch the government Rs.1.09 lakh crores and will add to the cost of mobile services, he did not possibly realize that for the large number of poor, this could mean an increase in mobile bills every month. The minister claims the increase in mobile costs will be marginal but the industry disputes Prasad's claim. Bottom line is increased costs will have a direct impact on the pace of implementation of the PM-championed Digital India, which seeks to connect every poor rural household in an inclusive digital vision.
	Of course, it is wrong to conclude that the high price for spectrum paid by operators in the recent auction (the government earned 25% more than it had estimated) will automatically be passed on to the consumers. In the past telecom players have shown efficiency in absorbing the higher costs due to intense competition. In a situation of perfect competition, with many players in the fray, it is natural for mobile services company to focus on retaining and growing their market share, especially in rural India, which is, at present, registering the bulk of incremental growth.
	The mobile telephony industry has been bitterly complaining  and has argued that its current EBIDTA (Earnings Before Interest, Depreciation and Tax) works out to about $6.5 billion annually, and its total costs, including capital expenditure, payment for spectrum, interest costs etc works out to $13.5 billion. So the costs are double that of the earnings, and the spectrum auctions have only added to these problems. Therefore, technically the industry, if it wants, can cover costs and make some profits by roughly doubling the mobile charges.But this may not be a sustainable solution from the standpoint of implementing an inclusive digital vision. The massive spread of telephony has happened in India only because of its low cost to the consumer. This cannot be reversed.
	Consequently, there is a need for the industry and government to work together. Industry cannot complain about the auction process, because there is a strong political-economy background to this. The telecom or 2G scam resulted largely because spectrum was given away in 2008 to industry in an arbitrary manner at throwaway prices. After the intervention of the national auditor and Supreme Court a few years ago, the UPA had to undertake a policy course correction by resorting to an auction of spectrum. The overall philosophy of  telecom policy and regulation should be a balanced distribution of surpluses between the consumer, operator and the government. The government and industry should sit together and find ways to effect a balanced distribution of surpluses between the three stakeholders.
	This can only happen with the rapid expansion of the Digital India project, which lays equal emphasis on data-driven growth in rural India. This will expand other market segments for  private mobile service providers, who are today largely dependent for revenues on the voice market. They cannot raise rates for pure voice service dramatically for fear of losing customers. The only option for them is to explore the market for data services.
	The government can play a big  enabling role in the expansion of data-related services by connecting the millions of educational institutions, and district-level government institutions which provide essential services. If this public-private partnership succeeds, then the revenue base of the private mobile services can expand without necessarily making the consumer pay much higher charges for use of mobile services. The government must use its Universal Services Obligation fund, now $4 billion, which mandates that such money be spent to enhance rural connectivity.
	The private sector and government must get out of the current confrontationist posture with each other and find solutions which help everyone, including the consumer.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            But you missed to note down the key difference between other countries and india..the population.. you have a large customer base in india so for essentially same infrastructure set up you have more customers in india..imagine..25 million people making 5 calls a day and average cost per call is 10 paise...you can do the maths do see how much revenue is generated. the telecom companies cannot cry over the auction..

                            the inferences you have drawn in para # 3 are misleading.  You claim that the collective EBITDA for service providers is $6.5 Bn, whereas the cap-ex, interest and spectrum price is $13.5 Bn, hence costs are twice the revenues. <br/>
Two issues here - <br/>
Anyone w/ a preliminary understanding of accounting (myself included) knows that cap-ex and spectrum costs (also a cap-ex,btw) are CAPITALISED (i.e recorded on the balance sheet) and not EXPENSED in the annual P&amp;L. Companies claim significant DEPRECIATION on capitalised expenses (over a significant time period) which serves as a tax break (read: INCENTIVE). Hence your statement in this context is incorrect.<br/><br/>
Secondly, the number $13.5 Bn is twice the EBITDA, EBITDA IS NOT REVENUE!!!! <br/><br/>

                            Don't understand what these so called analyst want? If there is. Auction and govt get the right price they say it will increase cots ...if no auctions than we say five is not reforming and their are gotala!! Reality is we have to pay the price for service ...Benifit can come in different wAy ...if this monies is utilised properly may be the migrant worker does not have to migrate for the job and can stay with family !!

                            I can't believe after so many years of Mobile phones evolution, still the costs are double to the earnings, how can it be possible ? No private organisation will bear it. Am i interpreting the data wrongly ?

                            is the answer yes or no??<br/>
This is such a generalized article, it looks like the research for the same was done on Wikipedia with no concrete thought gone into it.<br/>
Even i Could have come up with the same conclusions, and analysis. NOTE to @NDTV i will be willing to do the same work at less the half the cost!<br/><br/>
My understanding is that while in some cases the cost will marginally go up, but due to competition the overall burden to the consumer will be negligible at best.  Also note: This is 2G auction, and for pure Data Services 2G sucks!!!  also 25% higher than the expected revenue from the auction isn't such a high no.  for the sake of Prudence i would assume you would estimate a bit lower (maybe 10%) than what you would expect to get, just so you dont look too bad.<br/>
So i would expect these licenses to be more of a hold what you got in current circles, and see if one can get a small foothold in another circle.  Overall i would have budgeted to keep the prices same considering the competition in the market.  I would assume after a few years there may be some consolidation in the market because of the high competition and low margins.  Once that happens with less players Tel Cos may have more room to increase prices.<br/>
Also let us not forget BSNL and MTNL as Govt Cos may be obliged to keep there prices low, so for ppl who only need basic services, they may eventually migrate to them.<br/>
Conclusion: In the Short-Medium term there will still be low fares on offer. Beyond that it all depends on how the market expands and if the co's can increase their active user base.<br/>
Who thinks this analysis is better than the Article????

                            If the telecom companies were running on loss, they can close the shop and leave. The fact that new companies are joining the market means they *are* profitable. By increasing the price, they just want to make more profit. And the pro-corporate Modi will let corporations steal poor mans money. Simple fact really. *NO* company will run a forever lossy operation over decades. Whom are you fooling?!

                            Let the Telecom Minister ensure that BSNL and MTNL dont raise their rates. That will keep the other private sector operators in check.

                            The catch here is, and what seems to be the driving point of the argument,  comparing EBITDA with costs. Anybody with a rudimentary understanding of financing/accounting will tell you that EBITDA isn't revenue earned, but a vague representation of a company's current operating profitability!!

                            Let us wait and watch......what the companies/Govt/customers do ...The bids in 2010 got 1.06 lakh crores as against 1.09 lakh crores in 2015...it is not a great increase of revenue...compare the spectrum wavelenghts auctioned also.....

                            Who told you that EBITDA is revenue, it is actually revenue - cost except for depreciation, interest, and tax. <br/><br/>
So the while premise of the argument above is lost in a way. What above shows that organisations do not have the free cash flow capacity to fund themselves and will need more equity or debt.<br/><br/>
The business case or the lack of the same is not clear from the article though one would assume it is not based on the ability of the consumer to pay significantly more than current levels.

                            Why will the telecom companies bid such high amounts if they are not sure that they will be able to break-even? I would not trust the big companies to get the spectrum at a cheaper price assuming that they will pass on the benefit to the consumers. I would rather have the government earn all that they can through auctions and pass the benefits to consumers directly through cash transfer schemes. I am pretty sure the big businesses would not have bid the high amount without a plan in place to recover that money, that is how the businesses work logically!
