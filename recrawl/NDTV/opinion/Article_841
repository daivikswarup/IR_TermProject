Headline::::Why AAP Ran Full-Page Ads When Accused of a Scam



DateTime::::2015-09-21T21:14:00+05:30




                                Today I am writing in anger. Today I am writing not as somebody who is an official spokesperson of a party. Today I am writing as somebody who was a professional journalist for two decades. Today I am writing as somebody who contributed majorly in forming the Broadcast Editors Association (BEA), created to intervene on behalf of editors to uplift the content, preserve the institution of editors and fight any external attack on news channels and its freedom.
An untrue story run on a Hindi news channel on Sunday without any verification of facts;  serious accusations were made against the Delhi government led by AAP of which I am a member. The story is based on an RTI whose veracity is doubtful; based on that RTI, the BJP is accusing AAP of buying onions from Nashik at Rs. 18 and selling them to the people of Delhi at Rs. 40. The BJP describes this as a scam with accusations of money being siphoned. The BJP is in the opposition, and it is well within its right to accuse the ruling party of wrongdoing, but what is not acceptable is the conduct of a news channel which ran that argument and accusation without any verification. It just required two phone calls and some leg work to uncover the facts.
But this is not about another news channel. The truth is that the basic premise of the story was wrong. The story said that the AAP Government bought onions from Nashik at Rs. 18. In the first place, AAP never bought onions from Nashik. A month ago, the onions were purchased from a central government agency called SFAC (Small Farmers Agro Business Consortium), at a price of Rs. 32.86. It was the SFAC, that means the central government, which had bought onions at Rs. 18 from Nashik and sold them to  the AAP government at the higher price of Rs. 32.86. Adding local transportation cost of Rs. 3 and another Rs. 4 as commission to local vendors, the cost comes to Rs. 40. It was at this price that AAP government provided onions to people of Delhi and later, it revised the price to Rs. 30, offering a subsidy of Rs. 10. All the papers were available with the concerned department, but no attempt was made to cross check the facts - even when I asked  the channel over and over again to recheck, the story kept running.
Sometimes when  a story is  wrong or it was incorrectly or incompletely treated, an apology or corrigendum (a correction) is duly published or aired, and the matter is laid to rest. After talking to the channel, I was expecting that the story would be dropped and an apology would be gracefully rendered as is the practice in media. But unfortunately that did not happen. Then other channels also picked up the story with the sound bites and allegations of BJP/Congress. The Delhi government was forced to hold a press conference and put forth the real picture before the media. But the damage was done and the picture that was painted was that the AAP Government has committed a scam.
Now as an aggrieved party what option does the government have? One can argue that AAP can seek the intervention of The Press Council of India, or sue the channel for defamation. I don't need to remind readers that the former is a toothless body and its verdicts are not listened to by even its own members. It would take five to ten years for Courts to adjudicate the matter. Till then, the AAP government would have to live with a taint of a nonexistent scam. A fight against corruption is AAP's main political and social plank. This story was an attempt to paint AAP as being corrupt like other parties, kill its USP as a political party, finish its raison d'etre and its attraction amongst the people of India. What was needed was an extra ordinary measure, which AAP took with full-page advertisements in newspapers the next day detailing facts. I know senior journalists like Shekhar Gupta through tweets advised differently. But in my opinion, the AAP govt had no other option. I will go a step further. In the absence of an apology or corrigendum, why should it not be presumed that the story on the channel concerned was part of a bigger malicious campaign as some channels have been doing since the days of the Delhi assembly elections?
AAP's fight with the central government is well-documented; also consider that since the Modi government has come into existence, the media is under tremendous pressure, especially TV channels, to not criticise the Modi government and target the ruling party's adversaries. In private, they all confide that it has become difficult to function independently. Sometimes veiled and sometimes direct threats are communicated. Media freedom is gone. Since TV has a wider reach and a bigger impact than print, it's more vulnerable. I have seen promoters running to ministers, politicians, government functionaries for advertisements, and editors asking for selfies with ministers.
Today I am reminded of LK Advani's words: "During Emergency, the media was asked to bend and it crawled." And he was right too. Kuldip Nayar writes in his book Beyond the Lines, "When Mrs Indira Gandhi issued emergency some editors had gone to congratulate her for imposing emergency. Mrs Gandhi asked them what had happened to the big names in journalism because not a dog had barked." I don't want to be as harsh, but would certainly say that a compromised media and dwarfed editors are the first signs of fascism creeping into our body politics. It is time to wake up and to do something.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            We should all ask this part timer that why didn't the aap buy onions from nafed earlier and store it for the off season. Why did it ignore the warning from nafed? It is easy to blame sfac but why did it purchase from sfac and so late it became 32 from 18? Should  we now believe that MODI personally gave instructions to sfac that it should sell Delhi governsment at a higher price? Why is it that the AAP government could sell only 1/4th of its purchase?? Where did the rest of stock go?? News Channel said aap bought expensive onion through sfac, and what is wrong with that?? U guys didn't utilise fund wisely. Isn't a scam?? It is also possible that there is quid pro cuo between  the sfac guys and the aap government otherwise why would government buy 40 per kg when it available at 45 per kg, just to save Rs 20 per family per month or just to show off??

                            Generally I don't agree with Ashutosh. But it is absolutely true that Media only goes after BJP's adversaries and if it attacks BJP, it is only on name-sake issues and not core/vital issues. Bad for democracy.

All of a sudden , he remembers that he is a journalist ..,No shortage of hypocrites in politics. Go &amp; read / see his  behavior before becoming a politician vs now

                            You have very low understanding of what it means to adhere to the concept of "intellectual integrity" Please stand in front of mirror and ask yourself how many lies you have told, how many times just to please your masters you have compromised on the values to write articles, how many times you have even tweeted and how much crocodile tears you have shed when mob instigated a poor farmer to hang himself. You have turned yourself into just another politician. Only difference is you can write - they cant. If you have left with any soul in you, please read Gandhi's work as well as watch the video of "Nero's Guest" AAP is failed dream of many - quicker you realize that, better it becomes to dream again. Else like many - please continue of false notion of glory while others nightmare continues.

                            Dear Respected Ashotosh Ji,<br/>
When I read your message, it seems you wasted few lakhs in news paper just to hide few facts. Lets take picture from the point you explained<br/>
-- You purchased price at Rs32.86 and made it Rs40/-<br/>
-- Local transport Rs3/-, profit Rs4/-<br/>
-- Both are questionable<br/>
-- None of the vegetable are produced in Delhi sufficient to feed Delhi.<br/>
-- So even if you purchase something at Rs0/- i.e. free you will sell it at Rs7/-<br/>
-- If I am able it purchase potato at Rs8/- then it must be purchased by Delhi government at Rs1/-<br/>
-- Rs1/ also include freight from outside Delhi transport(which should be more then local transport)<br/>
-- It seems illogical and it should be scrutinized.<br/>
-- So I see two corruptions<br/>
--- corruption at distribution of onions<br/>
--- wastage of money on advertisements(I don't know how many lakhs or crores), If same would have been spent on public welfare, dengue would have been prevented.<br/><br/>
I hope you will rectify this next time.

                            Mr. Ashutosh the letter which you are showing now was with you since May-15. Why did you not expose the Central Govt. then. Why make false allegations once you are caught red handed. So better hand over the matter to CBI and wait for your turn to be punished by Law. A request Stop being holier than thou approach . Have reality cheque your anti corruption plant has been exposed and it is clear that you played with the sentiment of the people of Delhi and could fool them twice. rest of the country did not fall prey to your antics.<br/>
Come out with truth and apologise to the nation pack you things and go. Space this nation.

If so, you guys preferred to spend money on projecting your good image, instead of saving dying Dengue patients. What kind of character is this? I'll tell you - It's called politics of corpses. You allow people to die,  while you can save them and then blame Modi and then show your crocodile tears on TV. Shame on You!

Have you forgotten that AK was repeatedly saying that Ambani keeps Modi in one pocket and Rahul in another without any proof. So many defamation cases against AK is clear indication that he was taking without verification of facts, but no one used big adds to clarify the issue. Remember,  what goes around comes around.

                            sometimes being on TV and being recognized by face can give you a false sense of being intelligent and important. Everything you say becomes eternal truth and constants of nature. Ashutosh you are a moron who even does not know what to talk and how to talk, when to defend, what to defend and how to defend. Bottom line is that you are not an intellectual, you  are an opportunist who jumped the boat at opportune time and you were, like many other so called journalist, in the business of brokering and glamour.

                            Thanks for this article. The priorities of BJP seems to be banning , curbing freedom(recent draft on whatsapp messages is an example) and creating a communal divide. <br/><br/>
The fact is people are getting tired of this nonsense from BJP. It does not require a lot of talent to whip up communal or castiest or regionalist frenzy. It requires real talent to get people from all sections to live together with mutual respect and dignity - sadly that talent is missing in BJP. India will pay a price for electing these intellectual dwarfs to power.

                            @ Amit Kumar: it was Rs 20 per kg in my town without kejriwal's subsidy and my state is ruled by the greatest party in India 'SP'. Can u explain that? AAP hasn't got any ideology but it's members have certainly got a mentality of arguing with people who don't support aap. It a question of supply chain and demand.  Come on guys Adabi is right, how much would u save in 3 months by living on aap subsidy?? 3kg onions per month, which doesn't even amount to Rs 150.

                            Bjp and congress  franchise goons are running loose.<br/><br/>
Good work. It reminds me of people serving the devil to avoid being  killed. <br/>
However, after a while the devil thought to have fun and killed the people.<br/><br/>
Its no different to India being ruled under british or india being ruled by congress or BJP franchise.<br/><br/>
May be we could read Indian history in detail:<br/>
Indian served British emperor with the hope that they would be safe and earn some for family. The end findings show they had to kill indians as ordered. And the so called servants of British Empire were never treated at equal. The example of Mahatma  Gandhi to Subash Chandra Bose is written in history.<br/><br/>
Had we collectively acted and bycott british empire earlier, we would not have been ruled by then for over 180 years.<br/><br/>
The Bjp and congress franchise have taken British and emperor DNA to loot and destroy india.<br/><br/>
Its more of jumla and drama than development. <br/><br/>
BjP and Congress bhakt, keep the drama on, we are tired of the TV drama.
