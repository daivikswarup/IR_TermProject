Headline::::As IS Attacks Get Bolder, How India Should Respond



DateTime::::2015-07-03T17:28:00+05:30



"The terrorism took him," argues Mohammed Ferchichi, a childhood friend of Seifeddine Rezgui - the lone gunman who killed 38 tourists in Tunisia on June 26. 
Approximately 90 minutes before Rezgui opened fire in the Tunisian resort town of Sousse, a suicide bomber - Suleiman al-Muwahhid - exploded his vest inside the Imam Sadiq Mosque in Kuwait city. 27 people were killed. Another 300 were injured. 90 minutes before that, and thousands of kilometres away from both Tunisia and Kuwait, Yassin Salhi drove a van into a chemical factory in south-eastern France. He unsuccessfully tried to blow up the plant he had worked in, and was eventually arrested. The head of what is believed to be Salhi's former boss was found on a pike alongside flags inscribed with markings of the so-called Islamic State. The Najd Province - a group associated with the Islamic State - claimed responsibility for the attack on the Shia mosque in Kuwait. A tweet sent out by the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the actions of Abu Yihya al-Kairouni, the norm-de-guerre given to Rezgui, who received training in Libya. Whether or not Salhi was directed by the Islamic State to destroy the American-owned factory in France or simply inspired by the Islamic State is yet to be determined. French authorities have found no connections so far. In the cases of Rezgui and Muwahhid, it seems certain that they were inspired and trained by the Islamic State and its franchisees. 
These attacks only reaffirm the fact that the politics of persuasion is as lethal as that of the gun. After all, Rezgui was only 23. He wanted to be a break-dancer. He was turned by a group of Salafists in an unsupervised mosque in his university town. A compelling narrative around violence against the "infidel" combined with a dose of drugs - confirmed by an autopsy report - led to an act that in turn has every potential to escalate Britain's  - and the West's' - war against the Islamic State. 30 of those gunned down in Sousse were British tourists. 
On June 29, UK Prime Minister David Cameron forcefully argued that no one can "hide from this threat." "They are attacking," he underlined, "our way of life." The solution lay in an "attack at its source in Iraq and Syria." In short, he claimed, the Islamic State had "declared war on Britain." Whether or not the attack was designed to provoke a reaction is yet to be determined, but this is exactly what it has done. On July 2, British Foreign Secretary Michael Fallon stated that Britain needed to adopt a "full spectrum" response. This was denied to the Cameron-led Coalition government in 2013 when the House of Commons voted against such escalation. But the mood has changed, as has the government. Further, reports - first made in January 2015 - that the Islamic State in Khorasan, the older name for Afghanistan, have established a presence in the eastern province of Nangahar along the border with Pakistan is at the very least worrisome. It further threatens stability in a part of the world at war with itself. Ironically, and perhaps only for the time being, the Islamic State in Khorasan is also at war with the Afghan Taliban. The two groups seem to be battling for a caliphate that they both claim. It won't be long before they accept that an alliance is more in their interest than war. 
The debate with regards to battling a group like the Islamic State and its affiliates is a familiar one to historians and social scientists alike. In simple terms, such a war is fought on the ground with bombs and jets. Yet, and equally, it requires what might be called the development of a counter-script debunking the lines of persuasion that convinced those like Rezgui to commit cold-blooded murder. Countries such as Britain have tried to maintain this balance between kinetic action and carefully-crafted words of counter-persuasion for a very long time. Indeed, what is so difficult for Britain is that the battleground extends between the 81,000 square miles of territory controlled by the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, and the 80,695 square miles of territory that make-up Great Britain. 600-700 Britons are said to be part of the Islamic State's fighting cadre. In fact, around 4,000 foreigners from over 90 countries fight for the Islamic State. As one report makes clear, there are more British Muslims fighting for the Islamic State than for the British Army. 
In addition, this is not a male-dominated fight. Large numbers of schoolgirls from within Europe have made their way through Turkey to the Islamic State. This is a curious development. A document released in January 2015 by the all-women Al-Khanssaa Brigade (part of the Islamic State) in Syria makes clear that freedom for women is a highly dubious affair. Discouraged from fighting in the frontlines, girls are instead encouraged to marry by the age of nine. Their "fundamental function," the English translation of the document reads, is to "stay in the house." No matter the liberal critique of such documents, its appeal is clearly strong. It has drawn a number of young women to transition from relatively free and democratic locales to embrace a stricter code for life and spirit in a part of the world far removed from the bustling high streets of South London and Birmingham. Propaganda lies at the heart of this battle. Indeed, winning this war may well be close to impossible. Containing it is a must. 
This is where India needs to take a stand. This is not to suggest, like some have, that India too join the campaign with guns and bullets alike. In fact, this would be a calamity where the cost of action will very quickly outstrip any potential benefit. Rather, it is an opportunity to work more closely with nations like Britain and others in Europe from where the Islamic State draws its personnel and confidence. Britain today might just be at the centre of a Jihadi complex ordinarily thought to exist in South Asia and North Africa. For when these fighters turn away from the bloodletting in Syria and Iraq, they will be drawn to a Khurasan they claim as theirs alone. This Khurasan, they claim, is as much physical as a metaphor. It as much about land and territory as it is about ideas and beliefs - there is no borderline. Still further, these are beliefs held and worn by those from almost every part of the world. 
The assaults on June 26 ought to strike a degree of pause in the hearts and minds of leaders from across the world. Successful containment lies in greater cooperation. The terrorism that took the 23-year-old Rezgui away from his friends and his passion for dancing is supported as much by training and sinister mentorship as an idea. Defeating this idea will take more than the sharp reaction of nations under attack such as Britain. It requires those like India, with its sharp and long history of maintaining cohesion amongst division to work with those in the West. For it is essential to fully appreciate the sheer weight of those ideas that inspire hatred and which bombs and bullets alone cannot reverse.    (Dr. Rudra Chaudhuri is a Senior Lecturer at the Department of War Studies and the India Institute at King's College London.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            It's clear that the real enemy are radical preachers who confuse and brainwash gullible Muslims. They preach about the sheer beauty of an Islamic theocracy where every one would be a Muslim and the whole world will be under Muslim rule. They then contrast this with  liberal democracy, the foundation of Indian and western governance, calling it the devils work. It's no surprise when impressionable young Muslims are misguided into believing in this utopia and blow themselves up. The real enemies for india are preachers like Zakir Naik and madrassas who teach a puritanical version of Islam. These need to be banned ASAP.

                            The solution to this menace is hunt for terrorists and potential would be terrorists and kill them.

                            You still have not made the case as to what India achieve's by joining this fight. Currently ISIS is a threat to Iraq, Syria, Libya and the West. Elsewhere it might have a few sympathizers or agents, but it can be contained easily. Even in Afghanistan, the Taliban who are more into Pashtun nationalism are unlikely to ally with Arab controlled ISIS. So there is nothing for India in this fight and we should avoid getting involved in any way.

                            True India should join hands with US &amp; co. It is every citizen responsibility of every country.

                            Pro-war  journalist Rudra Chaudhuri wants to see blood in India is why he is asking India to respond to a war that's nothing to do with India and Indians. The sanghi defense minister has also hinted that it's been long since India has fought any war and hence the credibility of our military is diminishing.Modi has also not smelt blood since his last official pogrom in 2002. ISIS is a boogyman created by the west to dominate the Arab world.Involvement of India in such dangerous games is tantamount to suicide.But in case RSS and BJP is interested in bloodletting they can simply throw this country into the flames of Syrian war. I as an Indian patriot request NDTV not to allow Rudra and his likes to use their platform to advocate violence and war for a country that we want to see eternal peace in. Shame on you Rudra.

                            If you think that you can appeal to the better reason of terrorists then you have lost touch with reality. The correct approach is that of David Cameron. No one can be allowed to impose their way of life on others. They have to be fought with every means till every last one is safely under the ground and incapable of harming others. This includes ensuring all those who believe in their barbaric medieval ideas, as also their evil ideology, is exterminated from the face of the earth. It is a very simple matter. Those who are fanatical have no place in a civilised society and must be speedily terminated. To try to win the hearts and minds of terrorists is a mugs game. This is actually WW III and every sane country on earth, including India, must pool their firepower to destroy all of them. Huntington's Clash of Civilisations if you will. If they believe that jihad leads to heaven, no one on earth must stop them from attaining their objective. Speedily.

                            What exactly does 'work closely with Britain' means? He doesn't explain. I suspect Rudra Chowdhury is simply regurgitating what he has read about the reactions of those nations that are in the front line of this conflict - e.g.  Britain, Tunisia, Kuwait, France - and is lazily trying to connect them up to India, so it feels relevant to Indian readers.
