Headline::::We Cannot Ignore Inflammatory Sermons in Local Mosques



DateTime::::2015-01-16T01:53:00+05:30



(The writer is a political columnist, a lapsed historian and a committed conservative.)One of the most important shortcomings of "political correctness" is its ability to overwhelm ordinary concerns in a tidal wave of condescension. In the process, it often drives gut-level grievances underground and makes them more explosive. Last week's shootings in Paris have understandably provoked outrage and prompted a French re-discovery of the principles that have defined the Republic. Statesmen, intellectuals and ordinary citizens in Europe have confronted the challenges to free speech (including the right to offend) by flaunting the cartoons in Charlie Hebdo that caused offence to the murderous Kouachi brothers and the Al Qaeda cell. At the same time, despite a deafening 'liberal' silence on the subject, there is a strong feeling that a large number of Europe's first and second generation immigrants from the erstwhile colonies do not share the same ideals of citizenship with their host societies. In blunt terms, the potential security threat posed by Muslim immigrants influenced by extremist ideology has become a political talking point in Europe. The issue of free speech and blasphemy may have begun with the fatwa against Salman Rushdie way back in 1989 but the issues have snowballed after the rise of Islamism as a political force after 9/11. What was once seen as an issue of integration and supporting the national team in football or cricket-the so-called Tebbit test-has now touched upon fundamental questions of security. The London Underground bombings, the targeted murders of writers in Holland, and the enrollment of British and French Muslims in the ISIS army form a backdrop to the murders in Paris. The concerns these have aroused have fueled the rise of ultra-nationalist forces that seek a reinforcement of a defined national identity. There is a larger question that is implicitly being posed in Europe: what is the obligation of immigrant groups to their host societies? The US, a nation built on immigration, has (or used to have) a 'melting pot' philosophy that propelled immigrants to dilute their distinctiveness within a generation or so. The experience of Europe has been different. A draconian Republican ideal has meant that France has a rigid doctrinaire approach to the separation of faith from the state. The burkha has been outlawed as public apparel and even Sikhs have encountered problems over wearing the kara, a symbol of their faith. But this has not succeeded in dissolving differences that stem from ethnicity, religion and culture. In Britain on the other hand, multiculturalism involving the celebration of cultural and religious diversity has become a fetish. Consequently, there have been belated-and occasionally laughable-attempts to impose a standard of Britishness that is neither exclusive nor offensive. Yet, far from social cohesion being established, the problems have multiplied and become ugly. A large part of Europe is now engulfed in competitive distrust, victim-hood and even hatred. The multiracial consensus based on idyllic brotherhood and common citizenship is breaking down faster. Worse, mainstream politicians have been paralysed into either denial or squeamishness, thereby ceding political space to players such as Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage who claim to represent the robust common sense of the indigenous people. 'Enough is enough' is an expression that is now commonly heard from the lips of people who don't otherwise fit the bill of being extremists. Part of the exasperation is due to the impression that European Muslims aren't doing their bit to put their own house in order. It is in this context that the intervention by Britain's Culture Secretary Sajid Javid acquires importance. Speaking on a TV programme in the aftermath of the Paris killings, Javid felt that "it is absolutely fair to say that there is a special burden on Muslim communities because whether we like it or not these terrorists call themselves Muslims. It is no good for people to say they are not Muslims, which is what they call themselves."Javid's comments may, in the short run, attract the ire of fellow Muslims. They may well accuse him of trying to appease the Islamophobes. However, a more detached view would inform us that the genesis of extremism is to be located in some of the inflammatory and hateful sermons in local mosques. Yet, the 'special burden' is not on Muslims alone. In the end, all minority immigrant groups must recognize that respecting and adapting to the dominant cultures of their adopted countries is an obligation of citizenship. Paris isn't Peshawar.

                            We need a strong nationalistic pride in our country. This has been absent for the past 60 years because of CONgress low level agenda of subsidies and minority appeasement formulas. Modern, urban Indians have forgotten what happened in 1947. Those who forget history...India has many within that would betray, this should be kept in mind.

                            I wonder how the likes of Zakir Naik have been allowed to roam free for over a decade and even run a TV channel to broadcast his hate speech. I have personally heard sermons in mosques blaring on speakers condemning "kafirs". We have indeed been very tolerant and forgiving.

                            I agree, the media should come to the place I live, Wakad Pune. There is a slum area called KalaKhadak with a mosque, every Friday you should hear to the sermons that the mosque shouts out from its speakers. They speak against women, india, hindus and in a very nasty way. But nobody does anything. I dare the media to come and record what is being said here and play in their news channels.

                            Will these guys never learn? Liberal silence on the killings? Everyone condemns the attack, no one justifies the use of deadly force. It is in the analysis of the situation where differences in opinion lie.<br/><br/>
This is yet another instance of the use of the attack to propagate islamophobia. Is the US distinctly different in its treatment of immigrant groups? Ghettoization is a socio-economic reality, most prominent and increasing in this age of neo-liberalization. But as usual, for the author and his ilk this is yet another opportunity to paint all muslims as radicals. The special burden is on the majority community to prevent the oppression of the minorities.

                            Europe is a highly intolerant (no offense) group of countries. that is why they have divided themselves into so many tiny countries. They have no concept of multiculturism (forget multiple religions). And that is not a good example for us Indians to follow. India is a multicultural/muti-religious country. We don't have any significant Immigrants population. Almost all the people of different religion you see in India are all Indian nationals. Being a multicultural entity, there is no question of adopting a particular way of life.

                            Very powerful style of writing. I have been an admirer of Swapan Dasgupta's blog because of the forcefulness of his argument and reasoning, many hstorical facts and current issues packed together in a single sentence like Bose-Eienstein condensate.One simple reading is not sufficient. We are made to confront the reality in its pristine form.Coming back to the article, my opinion is that western/modern political philosophy treats individual citizens as an unit whereas Arab &amp; Central asian cultures treats  the clans as the unit. Clans/ethnic-religon groups often fight among themselves for political supremacy, the benifit is capuring the wealth created by the defeated clans, eliminating the male members and capturing the women folks for propagation of the victor race. In the earlier parts of civilisation it was acceptable but it is not in sync with modern times/beliefs.We are to confront this reality in a not too distant future. This fight/global war, in my opinion is inevitable and unavoidable.

                            Principles of absolute right to freedom of speech, equality, and separation of church and state, are not 'cultural' characteristics. They are characteristics of an ideal human society. There is nothing inherently French or Christian or western about them. The writer says all the right things, and then concludes with a glib, trite conclusion of recommending minorities to submit to the culture of the majority, thereby showing that he has understood nothing about whatever he himself wrote before that.

                            Very simple, if you are a minority you assimilate and integrate with the majority. Isn't that the rule in all the middleeast countries. They don't allow non-muslims any rights, so how are these people living in India but demanding their laws? Everyone else follows common law. They have no interest in India's development rather they follow taqqiya with outsiders but express happiness even when India loses a cricket match to PK! How can we trust them?

                            Swapan Dasgupta should preach on the same lines to RSS Shakhas and inflammatory speeches of Togadia likes. I don't think he will have the spine to do that. Besides, can all who those shut up who post venomous comments on other religions. Look at your own faith first and the mess around it has created. Unrest in Punjab due to a movie, a writer in Tamil nadu has been ostracized for exposing the ills of caste system and deities. It seems the Hindu majority has become dumb and deaf for their vested interests.<br/><br/>

                            if a muslim does approve of a fellow muslims, the former brands the latter as "not true muslim". some times they mean it, and extreme violence can break out as we saw of ahmediyas in pakistan. at other time they don't really mean it, and the condemnation is kinda wink wink as it would be in case of paris attacks, in which case some times dancing breaks out on muslim streets while some politically savvy muslim leaders close to west try to explain it away or show fake outrage.<br/><br/>
the muslim society has always managed to get away. the main reason is a strong saudi lobby in usa.

The Islamic origin language is the only allowed language to be official language in government and parliament, and it is also the imposed language in CBSE, ICSE schools, nationalized banks, railways, airlines. Even worse it is the only supported language in customer service even for essential services.<br/><br/>
Impostition of Islamic origin language has to be stopped.<br/><br/>
ALL the original languages of India should be made official languages instead of limiting to the Muslim origin and influenced language.

                            Mr Swapan Das Gupta, learn more: Hypocrisy Abounds: Free Speech as Cover for Islamophobia:<br/>
Although Charlie Hebdo has been upheld as a bastion of free speech for skewering all things sacred, it too has double standards. In 2009, the magazine fired then-80-year-old cartoonist Maurice Sinet who later faced charges of "inciting racial hatred" and promoting anti-Semitism by insinuating that someone's conversion to Judaism would contribute to his success in life. Strangely, the magazine did not apply similar standards to its depiction of the prophet Muhammad in degrading positions. This  spread in a 2012 issue shows the prophet naked. Even French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius expressed his disapproval of the images, saying, "I am against provocations."

                            @: @ScrewpanDasgupta: how come the same majority community in Kashmir never protect or even tolerate minority interests in that state?
