Headline::::My 10-Day Marathon of Total Silence



DateTime::::2015-03-20T16:42:00+05:30



(Devyani Khobragade is a diplomat and works for the Indian Foreign Service.)
	Two months ago, I went for my latest vipassana course in a beautiful small village in Chengannur, Kerala. I was hesitant, not fully ready to undertake rigorous 14 hours of being seated in meditation in a closed cell or a humid hall, or just one meal a day, the voluntary work of cleaning dishes, toilets, and laundry. But then I needed mental strength, clarity of purpose and the skill to be emotionally unaffected while carrying on with whatever life required of me. So I pushed myself and was pushed by my husband, who has observed the difference vipassana brought about in me in the last year.
	My apprehensions melted away as I made my way through the beautiful backwaters of Alleppy district and as I finally reached the centre, I was ready. I made my one last phone call home, handed over my mobile, books, pens and writing material to fully be with myself and my surroundings for the next ten days. I was quite happy as I came out of the dhamma mediation hall on the first night, having taken my vows to live a monk's life during my stay there. It's easy to do it under noble silence in those beautiful surroundings and moreover, they are simple and rational vows - I will not kill, steal, lie, imbibe intoxicants, and engage in sexual misconduct.
	I sat at the doorsteps of the hall, looking onto the paddy fields and coconut trees which provided the backdrop for the love dance of the fireflies, feeling content. I followed this with a cold shower in the common bath area and went to my dorm and was asleep by 10 pm. I was to wake up at 4.30 am to start my journey within.
	And so, I sat in meditation, plodding from dawn to night, battling sleep, focusing for the next three days only on the sensation that my breath created at the entrance of my nostrils - the first step of meditation called Anapana in Pali. Initially, I was tempted to take it easy since I knew the technique, or skip to the next and main meditation of vipassana. I was, however, held back through by my responsibility of being an old vipassana yogini - I was to provide a role model to the mostly new meditators there - I had to sit in the front row which is the norm for old students so I could not doze off, I could not eat the snack that first-timers are allowed in the evening but only drink a glass of lemonade. At least thankfully, no one could see me awake due to the hunger pangs that invaded every night.
	So for three days, I focused my mind through the practice of the breath to be able to perform the main task of vipassana, which simply put, is nothing but observing the sensations we feel in our bodies to their minutest details. Vipassana philosophy is simple and the method is rational. Every second, our bodies respond to external and internal stimuli through pleasant or unpleasant sensations, and the unconscious mind stores these sensations and develops craving and aversions towards them. When we learn to identify and observe these sensations during our moments or anxiety or ecstasy, we can understand their impermanent nature - Annicha in Pali or Anitya in Sanskrit - at the bodily level. Hence we are able to tolerate or enjoy these sensations with the organic knowledge that they shall pass. Since we have that knowledge at the deepest level, we are able to neither form attachments to the pleasant sensations and stimuli, nor develop aversion for the unpleasant ones. We simply observe them in our bodies and our minds, and see how long they last before they pass.
	Unbelievably simple and scientific but requires intense practice! I was stumped when I realized that Gautama Buddha had discovered 2,000 years ago what Freud and modern science had rediscovered perhaps only a century before - that our minds store memories and feelings in the unconscious that we have no access to, but that they can manifest through the body. Modern medicine also employs bodily sensations to cure psychological disorders through Biofeedback - a method that involves observing and controlling somatic sensations such as heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure and breathing, in order to control mood swings and anxiety.
	The Buddha offered us much more than an access to and catharsis of the unconscious. He taught us a way to prevent further development of craving and aversions, by being bodily aware that change is the only permanent thing in life. That's all there is to the practice of vipassana. As I sit for fourteen hours and watch the sensations of my body from head to toe, I remain aware that these sensations and feeling, whether pleasant or gross and unpleasant are impermanent - arise and pass away - so why do I need to develop a craving or abhorrence towards them?
	Merely being aware of this truth of "this too shall pass" at an intellectual level has never helped me so far. Even now, I don't fully understand how knowing the impermanence of body sensations has suddenly made the desired change of patience, confidence and equanimity in me. But yes, as I sit there observing my body sensations, thoughts that come to me are the ones which I normally would have repressed - but I let them come and accept them as the reality of the moment.
	I accept that there is anger towards someone who cheated me, aversion towards myself, feeling of retribution towards someone who manipulated my feelings, or desire for someone or something, for acceptance and approval, fear of failure, and so on. Then slowly without frustration, I remind myself that the sensations these thoughts produce are annicha and hence equanimity will prevail.
	Slowly my negative thoughts lose their power and effect. Being aware of a pleasant sensation that a compliment or loved person generates is more difficult, although I gradually realize that over-stimulation or over-excitement feels physically uncomfortable now - a good reminder that I need to observe the sensations that happy thoughts produce.
	Performing Vipassana, and following simple precepts in everyday life, makes for a spiritual philosophy. I don't need to know if there is a God or not. I live and get results of my conduct in this life itself. I cannot hurt others by not hurting myself first; I cannot generate anger and not harm myself. Moreover, I live my life richer - I experience every single sensation as it arises by slowing down and observing it - whether it is how my foot feels as I step on the ground, or the food that I chew slowly, or the smell of flowers as it hits my nose, or the feeling in my chest as I my see my loved one smile, or the feeling in my fingertips as I wash my dishes or laundry, or work on my computer. Hyper-perception through mono-tasking perhaps! If I focus on going faster in my half-marathons, here I focus on slowing down as much as I can - both being complimentary as they both involve focus on the particular moment.
	I can't believe that this spiritual and yet scientific way of living has been available to us for centuries but we have almost lost it in ritualism, dogmatism and communalism. At the vipassana centre, I could not but help notice that most of my co-meditators were young Westerners or people of other nationalities, with very few Indians. Most of them also performed yoga beautifully in between hour-long sittings. They were obviously making good use of our ancient cultural heritage. What about my young India, I thought?
	While I realize that our younger generation probably can't afford to take breaks like this while competing in an academic rat race that they are pushed into early on (at least I was), and that they do get some emotional grounding due to our strong family system, it is precisely because life is so hard for young Indians that they need the spiritual mooring of vipassana that no amount of prayers whose meanings they don't even understand can bring. What really makes me happy is to hear my five-year-old say that she too meditates sitting quietly and stroking her cat for half an hour every day! Atta girl! She has understood that enjoying solitude and quietness by herself is the beginning of meditation! I really wish more and more of our youngsters would be encouraged to get more spiritual and scientific. I wish I could do more in this direction.Bhavatu Sabba Mangalam - BE HAPPY!Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Does this clean your conscience too. Or is this a new wrapper for your public life. Come clean Devyani on Adarsh, write on it, talk to us and then some day you would be heard without doubt by us. Don't bury. Unless you have switched genres to Speaking Tree or Page 3 Spirituality.

Let her create a trust for the poorest of the poor of this nation and put her looted money (now since she got awakened through yoga and spirituality) and that her family members are also on the path of detachment and spirituality ,,, If she does that some one will believe her , otherwise she will continue to an object of sarcasm at least in Social media ..

No Vipasana can cleanse your sins. When your own department says your children have US and Indian passports - to enjoy both sides of the world - and you always tried to bite the better side of the cake - MBBS and IAS - denying another deserving girl the opportunity to become a doctor.... sins are endless.

The author makes personal comments here "I accept that there is anger towards someone who cheated me, " what does she mean by that? Who cheated whom?  If she is referring to the maid, then this statement implies all the findings of law enforcement agencies are false.

                            I have never understood this- why does NDTV encourage and give a platform to dishonest civil servants like this lady, who single handedly (with more than a little help from her equally corrupt father) almost destroyed the Indo -US relations, by publishing their 'opinions' etc? Honest citizens of this country are sick to core about such civil servants. Isn't it ironical, that on one hand we have disgraceful civil servants like this father-daughter duo and on the other hand there are a few rare gems who courageously fight for injustice, decency and probity in public life but end up paying a very heavy price- their very lives! (the recent DK Ravi IAS being the case in point).<br/>
My humble request to NDTV- please don't encourage and invite such people to write opinion pieces. Surely, there are a lot better qualified people out there!

                            She ends the article saying that she is happy as  her 5 year old have started to meditate stroking a cat. Imagine the plight of so many 5 year olds in this country who do not have a square meal a day  <br/>
She is a power hungry woman who used and twisted the system to her advantage during studies and her career.<br/>
Her wealth is surely ill gotten.<br/>
NDTV should not encourage these sort of people whose ethics, integrity &amp; honesty is in question

                            What is the use Devyani ? You should have some convenience when you wanted to cheat the maid in USA and you would not have got caught, when she pleaded and begged you, but you were arrogant. Again after landing in India, you are not correcting your father who is till trying to use caste base influence to support your wrongful position. <br/><br/>
If you are honest about your experience, go admit your guilt, and repent and the whole world will forgive you and admire your courage, honesty and leadership.

                            Congratulations to the writer for giving some insight in to what the whole thing about Vipassana is. Shri Goenkaji has a very calm and soothing way of talking and explaining things, however, to an outsider,the rituals or activities during those 10 days remains a suspense forever. I am more than inclined to do the course very soon now

                            A G A I N. Lot of hate towards Devyani Khobragade. Reason - simple she is dalit. Nothing else. She has never done anything wrong anywhere. She is a victim. But all the comments are against her. That's what happened in India. Women don't have to do anything wrong to face injustice - its their fate. Lot of them died before born, else later on killed by father/brother if they saw them talking to boy, oh that's not end then she may get raped, if still survive they were killed/ burned by in-laws, ..............and btw if you are from lower caste then all the world will become against you (in India ). How dare you go to school, how dare you done well in studies, how dare you compete in civil services - and what the hell you gone through it !!!!! Now give just a small , very small opportunity - and whole of India will be against you in no time.

Then how this is an exploitation case. What Devyani Khobragade has done is done by all the diplomats of India in US and all other countries and still doing it. But none of them face any such charges or problems. Its nothing else but pure a case of dalit victimization. Did anyone knew, how come family of maid reached US after the case. How the maid' whole family get US visa ??? NO one is asking relevant questions but cursing a dalit. Because cursing a Dalit is best Indians can do.

                            Cognizant of the legalistic culture of the American system, and aware of the issues surrounding the treatment of domestic workers in the U.S. (after all, a similar case had also been filed against the former consul general of India in New York, Prabhu Dayal), the Indian government should have informed all Indian diplomats based in the U.S. that this was a serious concern. Some of the options now under consideration, such as making the domestic workers employees of the Indian government rather than of the individual officers, could have been implemented long before this latest controversy. But who care, Indian got another dalit to victimize and they are happy about it.

This website is in English so read and commented by well educated people for sure. If well educated people of India start spewing such hatred towards Dalits then  what to expect from uneducated people of India. That's make reservations more and ore sense. Dalits will be hated by all upper class/caste people even for no fault of their own. No one who commented here knew about the case in which Devyani Khobragade. She was victim. US has done a very big mistake, had India done similar things to US diplomat, India could have faced serious  consequences. But here all Indians are abusing their own, may be because Dalits are not considered their own by rest of India.
