Headline::::Modi's Instincts On Pak Are Proving Correct



DateTime::::2015-08-06T20:38:00+05:30




                                The latest terrorist attack in Udhampur has turned the spotlight on the proposed talks between the National Security Advisors of India and Pakistan. Coming on the heels of the recent attack in Gurdaspur, it raises urgent questions about possible motivations behind these attacks as well as the appropriate Indian response. The Modi government has rightly refrained from any hasty move and has indicated that the NSA-level talks will proceed as agreed between the Prime Ministers in Ufa. The ball has been lobbed into Pakistan's court. If Islamabad tries to backslide from the talks, it will have to bear the blame for scuttling dialogue. 
The reason behind the spurt in the terrorism is not difficult to fathom. By agreeing to let the NSAs meet and by accepting the invitation to attend the SAARC summit in Pakistan next year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the stakes of diplomatic engagement for all concerned. The fact that the statement read out by the two Foreign Secretaries contained no direct reference to Kashmir was seen in India as a point scored against Pakistan. But the real question was why Nawaz Sharif agreed to such a formulation. Was it because Mr. Sharif mistakenly felt he could carry the Pakistani establishment with him? Or was it because the Pakistan army wanted to hand him a long rope by which to hang himself? 
In any case, the alacrity with which the Pakistan government disavowed the Indian interpretation of the statement underscored the pressures at work on Mr. Sharif. New Delhi declined to enter into a propaganda debate, insisting correctly that the dialogue should go ahead as laid out in the statement. The terrorist attacks that followed were clearly intended to egg on India to call off the talks or to respond forcefully-perhaps both. In effect, they sought to capitalize on the Modi government's tough image. 
The government, however, has done well by refusing to rise to the bait. Equally important, it has so far managed to lead-rather than follow-domestic opinion on this issue. The Congress party's criticism of the government for being "soft" on terrorism was notable only for its lack of imagination. Of greater concern to the government is the BJP's own support base. The Home Minister's assurances about a "befitting reply" are evidently aimed at pacifying this audience. Still, the government might want to tone down its utterances, if only because they also raise expectations of a strong response in the event of a serious provocation by Pakistan. If anything, the government should take the line that defeating Pakistan-sponsored terrorism will be a long game of attrition-one in which patience will be a key asset.  
As for actually responding to Pakistani terrorism is concerned, the government has the entire range of political, military and intelligence tool at its disposal. These have been used in various combinations to degrade the capacity of the terrorist organizations and their state-sponsors. The trend in terrorism that we are now witnessing-a marked increase in attacks on soft targets near the LoC and the border-is itself an outcome of our success in reducing cross-border infiltration and insurgent activity in Jammu and Kashmir. For instance, the general officer commanding 15 Corps in Srinagar has noted that there has been no infiltration at all into the Valley this year. Similarly, our operational responses will send more than adequate signals to Pakistan about how we intend to tackle any rise in terrorism. In the past, such tacit signalling has played a more important role in stabilizing levels of violence than explicit statements from India. 
Diplomacy is at most of marginal utility in the fight against terrorism. There is no correlation between the levels of violence and our willingness or unwillingness to talk to Pakistan. By the same token, our refusal to engage Pakistan can hardly help address the problem of terrorism. It can only give us a false sense of satisfaction about 'isolating' Pakistan, while in fact we unnecessarily paint ourselves into a corner. By refusing to engage, we allow the Pakistanis to occupy the diplomatic high-ground and draw avoidable international interference in our foreign policy. By contrast, enlarging the diplomatic agenda will enable us to bring more issues and linkages into play. Mr. Modi's initial instinct vis-a-vis Pakistan was close to the mark: India needs to walk and chew gum. 
That said, we should temper expectations on what can come out of the meeting between the NSAs. The recent events have certainly strengthened our stand on Pakistan's support for terrorism. The capture of a Pakistani terrorist in Udhampur will give us more credible evidence to thicken the dossier. But the meeting is likely to be lop-sided. While India will table evidence, Pakistan will produce propaganda. There are already reports about Pakistan preparing to confront India about its alleged involvement in Balochistan. Islamabad is apparently planning to take up Indian intelligence activities in Pakistan at the United Nations. Never mind the fact that such Pakistani claims have failed to convince any other country. In short, the NSA-level dialogue on terrorism may not be helpful in tackling the underlying problem. It can be useful insofar as it helps us to begin engaging Pakistan on our own terms. Yet if this engagement is to yield any tangible outcome, the diplomatic agenda will have to broaden beyond terrorism.       (Srinath Raghavan is Senior Fellow at Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            The fact is, modi has reached a position where he can neither swallow nor vomit. The reason is that he has changed his position so many times that people think that he doesnt have a plan for pakistan. He first invited navaz sherif for his swearin in, then he snapped ties with pak, then restored again. Now he has to snap ties again. There is no consistent workable plan to tackle pak as far as modi is concerned. Attacks have gone up, so have infiltration. Paid writers will always support modis decision. <br/><br/>
We dont need a pro or anti pakistan policy. We need  policy that is best for India.

                            Hahahahahaha. Similar explanations given by then sympathetic opinion makers/researchers/fellows of UPA too. Frankly we'd rather see some results on ground. Why can't we start with some economic sanctions of our own? Why offer MFN status to Pakistan when they've never reciprocated? Start squeezing the money and see the drain. It maybe slow but effective. Pakistan is not an oil rich nation to be able to sustain without aid. Only saying why does India have to contribute to their economy? Not like Pakistan can make a dent in ours except with terrorism.

                            One year of Modi is enough for one to understand that he has no say nor he has any calibre to solve any crisis, be it issues with Pakistan or naxal attackes or Vayapam or Lalitgate to name a few. He is nothing but a show organiser or an event manager who has an acess to unlimited fund. Talking about an article than author seems to have a blinker on to shy away from reality. When on earth Pakistan has done whats been predicted or what it is to be simple political protocol? They would always find something or other to walk away from any talk, any understanding leaving India to be embarrassed and to repeat the same tune of wanting to have a peaceful solution with Pakistan. So Dear Author, either get real or be contened with whatever pay package you have regardless what you write.

Modi may surprise us all because he has a beter feel for the real power Sharif as this time and hw far the Military is backing Nawaz Sharif.

                            Reality is that even Pakistan civilian government wants to continue talks with India due to pressure from USA and also they are not much interested in Kashmir now as they know the reality (which Nawaj Sharif accepted with Mr. Kuldeep in his informal talk) that current LOC can't changed by both countries. <br/><br/>
But it is also fact that Pak Army, ISI and many militants organization based at PoK are not interested in peace talk between India &amp; Pak. So they are doing there best to hold talk. But it is good response from both countries that despite such hurdles both countries would continue talk...<br/><br/>
Pak government has no control over army, isi &amp; militant organization. So best way to continue talk with Pak even though it would not give any result and same time hard response on border or inside country on any attack by militance

                            Modi once said with a 56 inch chest that Pakistan will not dare to plant such attacks under his rule, if they do so they will seize to exist. So now are you saying that Modi will just copybook the Congress on Pakistan related diplomacy. If that is the case, then its fine. We do not need any more wars or unnecessary tensions.

                            Modi has a confused foreign policy when dealing with paki. First he invited navaz sherif for his swearing in ceremony, then he stopped talks with paki, again he started talks. Now with all these things happening in kashmir, he can neither swallow nor vomit. If he goes back to stopping dialogue, it will be seen as another u turn and his ineptness in handling paki will be clear. If he doesnt stop, he wont have any action/progress to show i  this matter...

                            Dear Modiji, keep the talk going on. There are always some elements who try to break this talk process and then blame on India that we failed to talk. Lets see how far they can go damaging the peace talk process. Lets make a positive impact. Either one day they realize their mistake or come to terms that they cannot runaway with this all the time. Lets show the world that we had tried everything to make this peace process work.

                            If I recall the holla-bolla from BJP during the UPA regime against Pakistan and their stand in such occasions, the current action by Mr. Modi is the height of U turn. Although I agree to the stance taken by NDA today, but I do not like Mr. Modi and BJP how they behaved in UPA regime. Do these politicians have to shame to U turn like this, just to fool us all the time.

                            Keep talking and bombing the crap out of them at the same time. Pakistan is not one government. The civilian govt. understands talks but the military understands bombs. The Pakistan military is occupied on its western front and does not have the supplies to engage on its eastern front.<br/>
Earlier the talks were about Kashmir, now the talks are about terrorism. That is a big difference people are unable to recognize. India called off talks on Kashmir because of terrorism.Now let us talk on terrorism and see what is their stand on good vs. bad terrorists. Talk about Kashmir will come later when we are ready to discuss from a point of strength.

                            There is a big talks at any cost lobby in India &amp; Pakistan exploits this. The issue in any talks has to look at the various promises made by Pakistan &amp; insist that they first honour the commitments before other subjects are discussed. Talks between India &amp; Pakistan legitimise Pakistan's terror assaults on India.India needs to boldly ask the world to chose between India &amp; Pakistan, especially with countries like China &amp; US. This would force them to put pressure on Pakistan to stop terror. Modi is merely following the tried &amp; failed policies of Indian Prime Ministers over the last several decades.

They want to ensure that Modi comes in weak position on the negotiating table. The level of nervousness was increased since Bangladesh visit as India and other SAARC countries is moving ahead without Pakistan. Constant terror attacks puts central government on weak spot( just as Kargil and IA hijacking did )<br/>
and tests the alliance in Kashmir..Just what Pakistani establishment wants..Indian government is indeed acting foolish by getting worked up while everyone seems to be enjoying Bajrangi Bhaijaan .. Get a person to keep eye on Pakistani media fools.

                            Modi's Pakistan's policy is sure to boomerang on us, in real bad way, if things keep pace as they do right now. This explosive situation on the border, where terrorists are able to infiltrate and ex-filtrate at will, as given out by the recent Gurdaspur attack, and the subsequent capture of Naved, in J&amp;K, is sure to escalate in times to come. In case it rises to the crescendo of a war scare, then the first thing that is sure to go out of the window for us, is any hope of garnering the FDI, for which PM Modi, seems hopping from one nation to another. With the economic slump reaching its third, or fourth year, as much as a travel advisory from the State Department for India, in case of a war scare,is sure to send the stock markets crashing. So in case of a full fledged war with Pakistan, we are sure to end up bigger losers on the economic front, if not elsewhere, given the size of our economy.How much of that we can afford is a moot point, and what dividends has Modi's policy towars Pakistan paid so far, are moot points.

                            I agree with the author. The only unfortunate thing is that when the BJP is in the opposition, it seems to forget all these things. Then it is all about calling off talks and huffing and puffing even if it produces nothing. In fact that was Modi's initial reaction when he took office and called off foreign secy talks. A little consistency is good. Anyway, better late than never - at least now a more nuanced policy is evolving
