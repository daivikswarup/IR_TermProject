Headline::::Why PM Modi's Government Must Meet RSS



DateTime::::2015-09-07T21:42:00+05:30




                                Opposition parties, particularly the Congress, have been highly critical of the just-concluded three-day consultations between the RSS and members of the Narendra Modi Cabinet. Some Opposition spokespersons have claimed that the "cat is out of the bag" and it is now clear that the BJP Government is not just remote-controlled by the RSS, but functions under the overt direction of Nagpur (the headquarters of the Sangh).
Those who criticise such interactions have no understanding of how the Sangh Parivar functions; they have no clue of the nature of internal democracy that prevails in the extended family of these organisations. Many so-called secular commentators and journalists have mocked Sangh leaders for repeatedly clarifying that the RSS doesn't give directives to the BJP or governments headed by it.
For instance, on the first day of the conclave, the rumour went around that the RSS had asked the government to implement OROP (one rank one pension) without delay. That was touted as the biggest takeaway from the meeting. Sangh spokespersons denied that OROP had even come up during the discussion. They were at pains to argue that the RSS does not get into the nitty-gritty of administrative decisions which are entirely the government's domain.
Without understanding the RSS's philosophical moorings, it is indeed difficult to comprehend the symbiotic relationship that the Sangh has with the rest of its Parivar. The role of the RSS with regard to its affiliates is that of an ideological fountainhead, which guides those entities, reminds them of their core ideological commitment, and prods them to act in accordance with the Sangh's deep-rooted nationalist and egalitarian principles.
It is the responsibility of the RSS, in a sense, to oversee the functioning of BJP governments. The Sangh recently reminded the ruling party that its economic policies must be geared towards "Antyodaya" (the upliftment of the most downtrodden in society) - a term coined by Parivar ideologue and late BJP President Deen Dayal Upadhyay. At the meeting, RSS leaders urged BJP ministers to tailor government policies keeping in mind the scale of mass migration from rural areas to the cities, which is bound to happen as cities develop and modernise.
This is a most timely warning as the Prime Minister's Smart Cities project is gathering momentum. The Sangh, which has always been concerned about growing discrepancies in society, wanted to convey its anxiety that the urban-rural gap should not widen further, nor the digital divide grow bigger in the wake of the Digital India programme.
In other words, the RSS seeks to ensure that India does not blindly imitate the "soulless" development model of the West. Even an amateur student of history knows that both the Capitalist and Socialist models of economic development have often overlooked human concerns; in other words, people's needs and choices have not been factored in while pursuing development goals.
For example, striking the right balance between development and the environment has always been highlighted by RSS thinkers. Although most BJP leaders have emerged from the Sangh school of thought, once in power, the pressures of delivery can often make them and the government as a whole lose sight of such parameters.
Therefore when the Congress and others snipe at the RSS-BJP conclave, it is out of ignorance of the positive role that the Sangh plays in guiding the BJP. Being outside the government, Sangh leaders receive constant feedback on the functioning of BJP governments. Further, affiliates such as the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (incidentally the country's largest workers' trade union) convey their assessments of the government's policies to the Sangh leadership, who in turn pass it on to BJP leaders.
Unorganised or family-centric parties do not have a mechanism whereby such dialogues can be held and course correction, wherever necessary, can take place. The "leader", or at best the ruling "family" is supposed to be the repository of all wisdom, and consultation with the rest of the party is minimal and sporadic.
Once upon a time, the Indian National Congress was also a structured party. Congress Working Committee meetings were held regularly and animated discussions would happen over the failures and successes of the government's policies. At AICC meetings, even ordinary delegates could go up to the dais and make observations critical of the leadership. Indira Gandhi destroyed most national institutions and even institutions within the Congress party.
There was a brief revival of inner-party democracy during Narasimha Rao's tenure, but now it's back to one-family rule. While it is the Congress party's business how it wishes to run the party, it is galling to hear invective being hurled by Congress leaders to denounce the constructive internal discussions that take place between Parivar organisations.
At such conclaves, Sangh leaders give their perspective and assessment of the BJP's functioning. No peremptory orders are issued, nor are specific instructions given. But the Parivar's broad ideological framework is re-stated, and BJP leaders asked to outline what they propose to do in their ministerial capacity to benefit the people, particularly the poor. The Sangh, for instance, has concerns on national security, education policy and cow protection among other things.
RSS affiliates are there to help the Government in achieving better results in all such areas. The Himalaya Parivar, for instance, is an organisation aimed at deeper integration of communities living on the northern border with the rest of the country. BJP governments are expected to work in tandem with such organisations to further the Parivar's common ideological goals.
Misgivings about the precise relationship between the Sangh and BJP emanate not only from ignorance but deliberate distortion by Left-wing historians, hostile commentators and biased journalists. On its part, the Sangh and BJP have never thought it necessary to bring out their internal equations into the public domain.
Having been at the receiving end of ceaseless demonisation and vulgar denunciation, the Parivar is understandably somewhat circumspect in countering Left-secular barbs that regularly target the RSS-BJP. It is felt that no matter what clarifications are given, those with a fixed BJP-bashing mindset will never alter their thinking. They will never realise that conclaves such as the one held last week can only help the government perform better and deliver quality results. In fact, there is probably a need to hold these more frequently.(Dr. Chandan Mitra is a journalist, currently Editor of The Pioneer Group of Publications.

                            Mr Minister, don't think people are fools and don't try to sound na√Øve. BTW, you don't have to take any guidance from RSS and RSS is no one to guide the government or assess the government. People did vote you to power for this. You want to give a report, give that to people.

                            The RSS has its ideological and nationalistic moorings in India's ancient philosophy and traditions. It is wrongly seen as a Hindutva organisation because of this. It has often been said that Hindu philosophy is the widest in the sense that it absorbs all streams of thought, even if some are seen as competing with each other. Then why is the RSS castigated for having Hinduism as its bedrock? That is because other religious philosophies or even political philosophies are in the nature of johnny come lately who feel threatened by the ancient strength and attraction of Hinduism. If they do not fight against the mother religion of India, they feel that they will be subsumed and absorbed into that culture. Their reactions are knee jerk, much in the manner that the ISIS destroys the ancient ruins of Syria and Iraq. All their conflicts with the RSS arise from this basic fear of their identity being lost. What they do not realise is that this is inevitable. It may be noted that religions that have grown in India like Buddhism, Jainism or Sikhism have never had any conflict with the RSS. Because their ideological moorings are the same. It is the imported religions and their political camp followers that have had serious conflicts with the RSS. Because their ideology does not match with the essence of India.

                            If you think RSS guidance to govt is not wrong, then they should officially accept that yes RSS is parent body of BJP and they have full right to have such discussions. Nothing is wrong with that. Any ruling party has their internal democracy and structure that monitors government, but problem here is on one side they say they have nothing to do with active politics and on other side such meetings. Moreover if issues like inclusive growth, northern involvement etc. are important to sangh then they should come out with stronger voice. But issues that get publicized are not so likable in public domain.

                            mr.Mitra,Unfortunately, your intelligence is of no avail to either RSS or BJP. The former can only think but not act and the later can act but has no brains to put hands to work.The very idea of development as conceptualized by BJP is wrong.The concept of benefits of economic growth through a percolatory model,is totally wrong .The percolation always ,because of social barriers,meets a impervious strata at the half way after which the percolation is negligible.The percolation follows a inverted pyramid path where as for a better growth of lowest strata the model should be the upright pyramid.For example, instead of development of smart cities what really is required is development semi-urban hubs in the rural areas to cover a hinterland of say 50 km radius. this will help,the rural masses and also check emigration of the people to cities.

                            Completly wrong on many counts. 1) RSS is not a constitutional body; it is a self-appointed social service organization. It may be excellent, but without a constitutional authority, it has no right to do a coarse review or even improve Government's ability, as Mitra said.<br/>
2) Who is RSS accoutable to? Only itself. So, an extra-constitutional body with no accountability except self - is wrong with the whole concept of parlimentary democracy when ministers - constitutional positions - give presentations and summary to RSS.<br/>
3) RSS - howsoever well-meaning - should not be engaged in Govt functions in any way. Because that is not the way our constituion is designed. The citizens of India may have a personal likeness or dislikeness or neautrality to RSS, but even well-meaning intent of RSS should be avoided as it defeats the way our constituion is supposed to function.<br/><br/>
So, C Mitra - completely wrong.  Trying to defend an indefensible.

Come December BJP will be 30 years old party!During its 30-year span, it has ruled from the centre for 16 (sixteen) days only from 16th may, 1996 to 1st June,1996!Again in 1998, it led a mega  coalition govt.as NDA-I for 13 months only(from March 1998 to April,199).And as NDA-II from 13/10/99 to 22/5/2004!Hence, this is BJP's "fourth" innings!Has any Vajpayee's Govt. met RSS anytime? Why this new development?The impression created is RSS is the Holding Company and BJP only its subsidiary!Modi(64) has 13 years experience of administrating a big state. RSS Chiefof the same age has just 6.5 years experience as Chief of  a Hindu nationalist organisation.Obviously their perceptions would differ.How then one could help the other?

As all the discussion took place behind close doors and Mr. PM, our beloved Mr. 56, attended the meeting which was presided over by the RSS chief, the doubts appear in our mind about who the real leader is. As RSS is the representative of so-called Hindus, BJP leadership should also attend such meetings organised by other minority communities. Will it happen - Mr. Mitra?

Either RSS has some constitutional rights to advise or consult govt. on policy matters etc. or they should also be treated as common folks of this country. I have not seen any of our dearest elected members coming to us asking for any consultation or even our views on what we feel about how they are performing in cabinet. I don't want to wait for 5 years and exercise my right. I would love some sort of presentation from govt. on what they are doing for us and advise (as per my intellect)them through out their tenure.
