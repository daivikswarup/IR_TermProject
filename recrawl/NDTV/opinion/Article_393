Headline::::Dear AAP, Why So Thin-Skinned Now?



DateTime::::2015-02-03T00:50:00+05:30



(Pawan Khera is a political analyst with the Congress party.)
	Caesar's wife does not just have to be above suspicion, she also has to be perceived to be so. Going by the rules set by the Aam Aadmi Party, she now also has to constantly prove that she is above suspicion.
	 
	From Kabir Foundation to IAC to AAP, Arvind Kejriwal has always used aggression as an answer to questions asked of him on either the way his organizations have raised funds or the gaping contradictions between his claims and reality.
	 
	A group of breakaway volunteers of AAP, the AVAM (AAP Volunteer Action Manch), have brought into the  public domain evidence of malpractices in the way funds are raised by the Aam Aadmi Party. They brought out screenshots of AAP website showing four companies  having donated 50 Lakhs each on the same date and same time (5 April, 2014) to AAP. 
	 
	AAP has always claimed that any donation higher than 10 Lakhs is scrutinized by its Political Affairs Committee (PAC). Was it done in these cases? If yes, why were these donations accepted which were clearly in violation of the law of the land?
	 
	Section 182 of the Companies Act allows companies which show a profit for last three financial years to make political donations to the tune of 7.5% of the said profits. In the case of these four companies, none of them has posted profits in their balance sheets. In fact they show dormancy in last two years.
	 
	As per the Foreign Contributions Regulations Act, no foreign company can donate to political parties. AAP has also reportedly been accepting funds from abroad which are routed through Indian entities.
	 
	Last month, there were stories in a section of the media that exposed multiple receipts bearing identical numbers issued by AAP in lieu of donations. Since the amounts in question were small and due to the hype created by the party about its honesty, the stories did not get the kind of traction they merited.
	 
	Political funding in India is a grey area. One of the major planks of Aam Aadmi Party was transparent funding of elections. People who had come to live with the existing gray funding practices, found in the party a fresh return to fundamental questions of honesty, transparency and an above-board conduct.
	 
	Today, when volunteers of AVAM furnished solid evidence of malpractices in funding of AAP and exposed its tall claims of mechanisms of transparency built in their functioning, AAP resorts to 'my shirt may be grey but yours is black' tactic. In a late night emergency press conference, the party demanded an SIT probe in funding of political parties. Predictably, it also demanded a probe in the funding of media houses and the funding of the political advertisements released to the media. AAP's defense is predictably aggressive as it lacks in content. They challenged BJP and Congress to lay bare their account books. Their leaders also accused its rival parties to be funding AVAM. Is that even a valid defense?
	 
	Apart from the technical aspects of the law of the land and the stated principles of the Aam Aadmi Party and their defense, this episode forces us to revisit the entire image building extravaganza of the party and more so of its convenor, Arvind Kejriwal.
	 
	The party managed to convince people that theirs was a movement - a movement funded and supported by the common people who wanted to invest in change. Thus, the-crowd sourced funds flowing into their coffers were a sign of the kind of support they and their brand of politics attracted. Even before people could express their support in the form of votes, they did so in the form of notes. The benchmark of measuring popularity through donations was set by Arvind Kejriwal himself and the party kept releasing news of its funds to reinforce the perception of popularity. The party now finds itself imprisoned by its own parameters. If there is a dip in funds, it also gets reported in the media.
	 
	The transparency of the desperation of AAP leadership can be seen in the fact that they are now forced to show large denominations of donations, even if they are from dubious sources, to be able to keep up the semblance of popularity.
	 
	The other two national parties depend on multiple sources of funding including corporate funding too. Almost all their sources are generically known. These are also parties which have built-in checks and balances. Shell companies giving crores of rupees to a party led by a man who claims to be an anarchist gives rise to more serious questions. Who are these unknown entities who cannot come out in the open and contribute to the Aam Aadmi Party? What is their interest in investing in the party? What would be the payback to them if the party were to form the government?
	 
	Aren't the known devils that fund other political parties better than these unknown angels funding Aam Aadmi Party, even though they are allegedly not making any profits through their stated businesses, which some say are listed with fictitious addresses?  
	 
	The party had made a fine art out of leveling charges against rival political parties, corporate and media houses. Most of these charges were not substantiated by documentary evidence and the onus to prove innocence was hurled at the doorstep of those accused. Many a reputation was thus sullied and the party got away with it.
	 
	The aggression with which the Aam Aadmi Party attacked people and institutions was hitherto unknown in our political narrative. It is this aggression which also helps Arvind in building an image of an angry young man voicing the angst of the poor and the middle classes. He cleverly identifies his political rivals to make visible enemies out of them to pander to the anger of this constituency of the angry.
	 
	It is of vital importance to know who are the masters behind this aggressive ambition to 'change the system', undermine institutions and 'serve the poor'.

                            so mr pawan khera, assume this situation. you start a ngo tomorrow and start seeking donations online.  i go online and donate 1000 rs.  now do you mind taking the money or will inturn ask me questions from where i am getting this money?  same case here! as long as i am showing this transaction in my books, i am good but i should not be held responsible from where people are getting money to donate me. How and why I should be responsible if someone is stealing money to donate me or working hard for it? <br/><br/>
you can not simply have this check in place when you are getting 1000s of donations online.  Its impossible task to validate each and every transaction.  If they had hidden this then it should have been problem but they have mentioned this online.  If they had to hide anything, why would they have put this online in first place? Isnt it so tough to understand?

I've read a few of P.Khera's earlier articles and thought my way of thinking was off the mark and his insights could be worth exploring. But no. It confirms. Absolute junk articles! Cant take it anymore.

                            A dubious donor has transferred the amount of 2 Cr through cheque. AAP says they are not bothered from where the donor got money. AAP feels anybody who gives money by cheque is legal and they declared it on the website. The giver and taker,both are responsible. Kejari accepts that they got money, so he is very much part of the crime in money laundering. They always play a victim card to gain sympathy. They are planning to scoot from the scene again. Very smart!!

                            1. Did AAP try to hide the transactions? No, they were downloaded from their website.<br/>
2. Did Kejriwal request the government to investigate this thoroughly? Yes.<br/>
3. Did the incumbent party try to get the companies verified? No, they "created" an opportunity to tarnish Kejriwal.<br/>
4. Did many AAP insiders betray the party and join the opposition? Yes.<br/>
4. Could they have sabotaged AAP from within? Possible, Highly Probable.<br/>
5. "Rupees 2 crore" are peanuts when you talk about the volume that flows in elections. Is it possible that those companies were floated by BJP's "blackops"? I would not be surprised.

                            The problem with the transparent funding is that there will be always some who will escape the net no matter how many checks and balances you put. Considering that we are talking about a funding which was nearly a year ago, it need not be done in such a hue and cry or put a blackmark on a party which is doing its job of listing its source of funding. For the larger good, the 1200 crore invested in national elections by all national political parties should come under scanner. Fixing AAP as a criminal and letting other parties go scot free would be unfair. I am all for an investigation of how political parties are funding their campaigns.

                            First time in india it is disclosed by Piyush Ji that a bank cheque transaction is money laundering. GOI instead of investigating the matter protecting fraud companies, perhaps this whole drama is staged by BJP only. I am not saying this, when Kejriwal said to bring this matter to Supreme Court of India to have an SIT, Mr. Arun Jately said, why to involve SC in this dirty game of politics.<br/><br/>
On one hand BJP says, it's a serious matter of Black Money and on other hand they don't even want it to be investigated. Shouldn't GOI do a fair investigation to come up with truth ?

                            wow, what a blatant hit job, full of strawmans spurious allegations. no wonder all traditional political parties are getting desperate and clutching at straws. <br/><br/>
"Last month, there were stories in a section of the media that exposed multiple receipts bearing identical numbers issued by AAP in lieu of donations"....."the stories did not get the kind of traction they merited."..<br/><br/>
You can scout the entire internet and will not follow a single new item on this. I am not talking about less coverage, i mean not even one article. if this is not called spreading rumors, I dont know what is.<br/><br/>
It is also disgusting for the author to smear AAP with illegality of the company.what do you want AAP to do, audit the companies??these fools are forgetting that any party does not have the right to ask for financial information from a company, the government does.<br/><br/>
To paraphrase another comment <br/><br/>
"Hawala ? Money collected via cheques. All Cheques have account number . All account numbers have name and addresses. This is not Hawala.<br/>
BJP have proved they are such FOOLS by giving such statements. Btw BJP , what is your source of funding ??"

Anyway as a political party all you can do is-generate a transaction ID and issue a receipt -you cannot be the private detective and income tax investigator and also character investigator of millions of your donors...there is 1 party which is making its funding 100 % transparent- if they had things to hide-why would they put it there-they too could have carried on spending money like BJP and Congress in cash-BTW -anyone find out -how PM could afford a 10 lakh suit with his basic salary-which too apparently he doesn't draw- any idea-where it came from?<br/><br/>
Dear Mr Khera- you have raised some very interesting questions and please be reassured-AAP is taking the matter to chief Justice of India- who hopefully will launch a thorough enquiry in political funding of BJP/Congress and AAP- if you want to suggest other names-I am sure they too can be brought in

                            The main plank on which AAP attacked Congress and the BJP was: acceptance of donations from big business corporates, implying that a later quid pro quo will be used to repay the kindness. AAP has itself now gone several steps worse in not   only accepting huge donations from corporates, but in the bargain, has  done so from several bogus companies which only exist on paper, have not done any business, have no funds to donate and have been set up with shady transactions and Directors. But they are still arrogantly defiant and daring everyone to investigate ALL parties, instead of answering how and why they did it. Congress, through its motormouth Digvijay Singh is very strangely supporting AAP by saying that the BJP could be behind this, deliberately ignoring the fact that it is Kejriwal's own former partners who have exposed this. It is the usual Kejriwal game: commit outrageous acts and then point fingers at others and shout loudly. Congress of course is willing to aid him as long as it can hurt the BJP, even if it is false.

                            Why are you bringing what Congis and BJP does? Assume they are thugs. They don't boast of being so clean and AAP pretends there's no other chamkar more safed than AAP's chamkar. You can accept funds by cheque with minimum info about donor. You proudly say you have ombudsman to look into such matters. What's is this lokpal doing? Didn't he check what these companies do? You feel amount is too small? Your lokpal didn't notice these companies are dormant? It's almost 9 months since your party got these funds. Why you never felt you should return this money back? It's easier to blame others.
