Headline::::Shanti, Shanti. His Attack Has Not Upset AAP.



DateTime::::2015-01-22T23:26:00+05:30



(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)
	When a senior member of the party like Shanti Bhushan offers an assessment, the party has to reflect on that; and if his statement has merit, it should be thought about, and if it does not, then the party should move on without showing any disrespect to him. At AAP, a party which has deep democratic traditions, every member has the right to speak their mind in a courteous manner.
	¬†
	A party which does not allow free flow of ideas and does not provide a platform for the independent expression of one's inner self - such a party can't claim to be democratic; such a party suffers from malaise and exemplifies signs of dictatorship. AAP feels proud that it does not have any of these weaknesses and it takes Shanti Bhushan's views in this context.
	¬†
	Shanti Bhushan has raised three points which needs elaboration. He has said that Kiran Bedi is an excellent candidate for Chief Minister and at par with Kejriwal. This statement needs to be contextualized. After all, AAP had the same opinion - remember Arvind proposed she be AAP's Chief Ministerial candidate during the last assembly elections, but she refused. We thought that she might have an aversion to politics and we respected her stand. We did not put pressure on her. But it came as bolt from the blue when a week ago it was announced that she was joining BJP and would be projected as its CM candidate. Were we wrong in our assessment about her last year? This means that she had no distaste for politics. Last year, perhaps she carefully weighed pros and cons,¬† thought that AAP had no chance and decided why waste time on a failed opportunity. It is crystal clear now that her refusal was not an ideological answer but a well-calculated decision. Perhaps when the BJP approached her, she thought she has a chance now and can become CM.
	Shanti Bhushan has commented on ticket distribution, alleging it has been mishandled. Let me explain. AAP is unique. It has evolved a system in which to become a candidate, the person has to go through an elaborate layer of filters. And even after being selected, if there is any complaint, then it is referred to the Complaints Committee which holds a court, listens the arguments and the person concerned has to defend and explain his/her position. If the candidate emerges clean, he/she is cleared of all charges and continues with the party ticket. The decision of the Complaints Committee can be challenged with the party Lokpal or omubdsman, whose decision is binding. This year, six candidates were challenged. The Lokpal was helped by a committee of seven members. Two of the six could not pass the rigors of the test and the party was advised to drop them. Which party has such a rigorous process of scrutiny and which party cuts tickets at the last minute in this way? If all political parties follow AAP, then the Indian political system can get rid of criminals. Shanti ji has also objected to some contestants, but if Lokpal did not find any merit in his complaints, then the party can't be faulted.
	¬†
	Shanti Bhushan has raised the issue of leadership of the party. He apparently meant that Arvind as National Convener has failed. That is very subjective. The party has full faith in Arvind's leadership. The National Executive has passed a unanimous resolution empowering him to take any decision regarding the Delhi elections -but the calls must be endorsed by the Political Affairs Committee (the highest decision-making body in day-to-day affairs). That he has been doing. Arvind enjoys overwhelming support in the party. He is the only mass leader who can galvanize volunteers and has a magnetic connect with the people. Till the party backs him, he is the top leader.
	¬†
	Shanti ji is an elder statesman. He has a very important role in the party. We have weighted his suggestions, reflected upon them and moved on. We are in the battle field. Together we will celebrate on the tenth of February!Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            While Shanti Bhushan spent months observing AAP &amp; Kejriwal and then provided his views, new entrants like Ashutosh take less than 24 hours to judge that his views do not have merit and so AAP should ignore &amp; move on :) Who are you fooling Ashutosh?

                            As a party member shanti bhusan should have raised this issue in inner party meetings and if he is not happy then why stay with AAP. Look what shazia did. she didn't like and  left party. she didn't go out in media in election time.

                            The problem with AAP is too democratic. BJP and congress have high command culture where they issue whip on slightest of dissent. It was wrong on shanti bhusan part to communicate via Media, he could have raised this within party or have left the party if he is not happy with its ideology but to say things in media during election time doesn't speak well of him

AAP, a party with deep Democratic traditions... C'mon its been a year only since AAP was established. And multi layer selection process? I mean are you for real? U mean to say multi layer selection process whose Kejriwal is member of, if candidate has some objections, he has to go to complaints committee whose Kejriwal is member of, holds Courts where Kejriwal is a judge, if found clean he is selected, after grilled by Lokpal committee and ombudsman, where again Kejriwal is head. I mean how a person is supposed to get a ticket? Because for Kejriwal only himself is clean and none other in India is clean ax he sees his fellow country man as corrupt, he does not even spare corporates who employs millions of employees. I mean he comes with a paper in his hand citing a list of people as corrupt. Is that a jock? Is that  a page from gita quran or Bible or supreme court order? AAP is misleading people by fueling anger in them by provoking them. Let them run away after this elections once n for all, because we know there needs to be a better system but not the way Kejriwal and aap wants.

AAP is like Gangotri of indian politics. Netas become PURE as soon as they enter gangotri but are devils as soon as they move out. 17 ex-BJP and congress members have been given tickets by AAP. They overnight turned saints. But BEDI, Dhir, Binny, etc are now corrupt. Its an instant transformation from saints to goons. <br/>
4 MIM members who have been given tickets by AAP are now secular but RSS is communal.<br/>
AAP candles burn only for Palestine victims but Assam riot victims do not deserve candles.

But as a close friend of mine is an AAP volunteer and to some extent, he endorses your statements, I say Bravo! Keep up the good work and develop your organisation. The days of Congress are over and if the BJP does not fulfil what Modiji promised us, then its days are numbered too. <br/>

                            did anybody ask him exactly what is so great about Kiran Bedi? She said that she was influenced by the media for her earlier BJP position...does she not have the capacity to think for her own? You want someone who is so easily swayed to govern the capital...ps wasn't corruption going on when she was in office? what did she do about it in the 90's?

                            Showing everybody else's positive into negative and showing their own negative as greatest positives is not only a trait of this gentlemen but the complete aap supporters. Somebody like binny wasn't even given a chance to speak, discuss and clarify and somebody like somnath was given clean chit coz that suited them and he was at a high post in the party. Now they also have a parallel system within their system to save well positioned guys like how maulanas do same way. When convenient do as it suits you.

                            Kumar Vishwas said yesterday that Bedi was always pro-BJP even during IAC days. He mentioned that both Ramdev and Bedi would not want BJP to be attacked. <br/><br/>
Given this was the case am surprised that AK not only kept quiet but was willing to give CM position to someone who was willing to overlook potential issues with BJP state governments. <br/><br/>
AAP is acting like any other party now. If they were only against corruption then AK would have spoken up when IAC was acting anti-Congress only and would not have offered the CM's role to Bedi. <br/><br/>
Only was AAP was standing out as it was anti-corruption. If that platform is neutralized, then the party will also disappear. With Comgress in disarray, BJP will get stronger. Hope Modi does a good job as lot is riding on him but also good to have a strong opposition.

                            You should have seen the behaviour of this Ashutosh character on Headlines Today.  He just hijacked the programme, became abusive to Anjana Ohm Kashyap and wouldn't even listen to the questions put to him, let alone answer them!  If there is a panel discussion, Kejriwal uses it to make totally unfounded allegations against all and sundry.  He does so knowing they cannot answer back. The whole problem with AAP is that it is a 'trial and error' party, there are no sound, 'costed' policies of its own.  These were a bunch of chancers who thought that Kejriwal was a new 'Gandhi' rather than a drifter who moved from one job/protest to another.  In reality, there is not much of a structure, there is hardly any income, their leaders have been untested in any field, there is no history and there is certainly no tradition.  In reality, this is a temporary phenomenon and in a short while this party will come to an ignominious end with its main characters disappearing into obscurity.

                            Sorry Ashutosh, your article is completely illogical when it comes to explaining the reasons for Ms. Bedi joining BJP. It also brings a new contradiction - If Ms. Bedi was good enough administrator to be offered CMs position last year, what has changed now when she joined BJP. Lot of AAP spokespersons are now openly challenging her honesty, dedication, administrative capabilities and so on. We all understand that it is an election but there is something called civility also that AAP was trying to bring to the politics. I think it would be great for you to keep in mind the fundamental reasons why educated people gravitated towards you in first place. <br/><br/>
The other day on TV, Arvind was trying to lampoon the government's idea of deploying LEDs to reduce the electricity bills through energy efficient lighting. He said in chaste hindi - "Who ek koi bulb lekar aye hair". Arvind being being an IIT engineer, he fully well knew what this bulb is yet chose to question the wisdom of a fully right decision with completely rustic/ incorrect logic. <br/><br/>
This brings us to the question of Mr. Shanti Bhushan's annoyance. AAP is now treading the path of extreme left to garner the votes by promising free everything ... where will the money come for this? The basic premise of IAC/ AAP was that there is lot of corruption that AAP is going to fight by joining politics thereby bringing down prices and so on. Please educate us did you unearth single case of corruption during your rule? Electricity prices were reduced through a subsidy. It is like stealing from Peter and give it to Paul.  AAP is a party of honest persons but it needs to fight what it aimed for and not become like so many other socialist experiments of past just to grab power.

                            Not only Mr. Shanti Bhushan who was like main founder and till now AAP's biggest donor but most of its founder member have left AAP or raised questions about internal democracy and AK's working style. <br/><br/>
AAP came with different kind of ideological ethical political concepts and people really liked it and appreciated it by overwhelming response in December 2013. But it is Mr. AK who believed it that people had voted for him &amp; his leadership quality. And after his behavior of ruling Delhi government and his support to people like Mr. Somnath Bharti washed out AAP's image as a better honest party. <br/><br/>
Due to AK &amp; his working style only, AAP becomes like party of agitator and city naxalist than  better alternate of other political parties. <br/><br/>
It is Mr. AK who is killing AAP not Mr. Shanti Bhushan or Shaziya Ilmi.

                            The party AAP which can't have democracy in the party itself is totally unfit to govern the state. Its own party members are exposing its hipocracy and double standards.

                            AAP is only a local party consisting mainly of highly paid young employees and NRIs who have all the money in their purse and no power. These people are fed up with authoritarian attitude of the politicians and want themselves to seize power so that they also can enjoy power without accountability. They needed a public face to lead them which they got in Kejriwal. Kejriwal himself dont have any policy or principle of his own. He only find faults with others and dont offer any feasible solutions. He offers moon to the poor and try to encash on their poverty. This cannot survive in long term. He may win some seats. But he is not an alternative to any national party on policies. 5 years from now Kejriwal will be part of history

                            AAP is just a B-team of Congress. Like undemocratic Congress like undemocratic AAP. They just excel in providing entertainment to public by their drama. Two times it has happened. They are unable to see the writing on the wall. God bless them. It seems Congress and AAP are in competition with each other as to who self combusts earlier. Meaning who becomes "Mukth Bharat" first. Is this the way to lead a political party. Kejriwal instead of taking Bhushans comments seriously is so full of ego that he is alone capable of the sinking the ship that he created. Ego is a wall that stops you from doing self realisation. Shanti Bhushan is openly and clearly telling certain things. Kejri and his coterie are unable to listen it. Best of luck AAP.

                            AAP has some great qualities as an organization but it also lacks experience and wisdom of doing politics. That only comes with time. BJP may not be as honest as AAP, but is more pragmatic and has a well established organization (which has its own advantages along with limitations). If AAP does not come in power, it should stay its course and act as a responsible opposition. It took BJP 70 years to finally grow out of its false characterization by the "pseudo secular" forces. Similarly, it will take some time for AAP to mature and people to recognize that they have other good options. When that happens, AAP will have the opportunity to govern with a stable mandate and do what it has always wanted to - bring an honest and transparent government to Delhi. Stable change does not happen overnight and I hope AAP is in it for the long haul.

It's good to see nobody is showing disrespect. The opposition and the media will definitely hype and sensationalize this. But AAP has been doing some really good work and must keep it up and not divert attention.

                            AAP seems to have only 1 person who can both attract and repel people, and that is Kejri. Fact is that no one else matters, no one brings votes or leadership in this party. No one, including Kejri, is a sureshot half decent administrator. They all probably speak well, but that is easy, you can win debates, but that does not say anything about the clout the party has, the ability it has to make things happen and so on. I do not see this party as being remotely ready to succeed. I do have my doubts on Kejriwal myself, but looking at people's confidence, maybe he can do stuff. But the rest of the party?

Personally I would vote for AAP at corporation level in Bangalore if they stand for it or even at Karnataka state level as BJP/Congress both look hopeless here unless Modi finds Bangalore's(or Karanataka's) own Kiran Bedi. But Delhi with Kiran Bedi at helm BJP is the safest and best bet with Modi at center.

Surely AAP like feeble structure cannot even think of spreading on a national level as they even crumbled in Delhi administration and many a ministers became night detectives acting above police and intimidating even foreigners ( Not that the foreigners were doing right things) , but everything has some procedure especially when it involves foreign national and policy ... Mr Bhushan was right ,,, instead of wasting time with AAP he should strengthen PM's hands as we all sure our PM will never set aside real talents like him ...

A Party is not a corporate entity wherein u can replace a CEO every now and then! Where was BJP without Modi's Charisma despite a battery of Leaders like advani MM Joshi etc? Where is Congress today without a charismatic leader like Indira Gandhi? Aren't they facing existential crisis for the want of good leadership only? And where would AAP be without Kejriwal?
