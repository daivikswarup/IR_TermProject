Headline::::What Pakistan Makes of Obama-Modi Chemistry



DateTime::::2015-01-27T20:30:00+05:30



(Mehr Tarar is former Op-ed Editor, Daily Times, Pakistan)As I glance at the headlines this freezing January morning, I'm shaking my head in slight amusement at "Obama pledges $4 billion for India in loans, investment" set a bit lower than "Pakistan an irreplaceable, all-weather friend: China." President Barack Obama's three-day state visit to India on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's invitation to be the chief guest at the January 26 Republic Day is what's kept the media abuzz in India, as also in Pakistan. This has been followed by the Pakistani army chief Raheel Sharif's official visit to China, Pakistan's "great friend", who doesn't share the same rapport with the US and India. I find the media frenzy on both sides ludicrously hyped.India is a 1.25-billion nation compared to Pakistan's 190 million, and to my mind - claiming to be neither an expert nor an analyst of the complex Pakistan-India dynamics - there's no Pakistan-India "competition." So whereas media in both countries may trumpet the significance of real or imagined issues, painting scenarios that have little or no relevance to the realities, the pragmatic few see the picture for what it is. Notwithstanding the military and civilian issues clouding any clinical and matter-of-fact discussion or debate about the status quo of uneasy politeness and simmering hostility, there is little Pakistan and India have in common - other than a shared history and cultural ethos. That been said, there is no escaping the sharp focus on Obama's visit to India. After all, the US is supposed to be Pakistan's ally, so why this preferential treatment to India, the nation that "disregarded" the US-led hue and cry against the Soviet presence/occupation in/of Afghanistan? Pakistan took upon itself the crusade to expel the Russians from Afghanistan, the spillover of which cost Pakistan from what it suffers to date: influx of refugees, heroin and Kalashnikov culture, emergence of radicalisation, the "orphaned" Mujahedeen. "We are not concerned with a nuclear agreement between India and the US", former federal minister Khursheed Shah stated. "What we find disturbing, however, is the double standards of the US...[how Pakistan had helped the Americans in fighting the war in Afghanistan for more than 30 years]."The on-going American drone attacks in the FATA in an open-end mission of elimination of various militant groups camping and hiding there is another elephant-in-the-room that seems to escape most Pakistanis bemoaning the "cold" attitude of the sole superpower vis-a-vis its "old" ally. The question of having a normal, bilateral relationship - based on mutual economic and geopolitical interests - does not arise when the bigger power is in an act of war in one part of its so-called friend's territory.In a certain parameter, India and Japan have assumed the role of "kingpins" of the "new" strategy dynamics in the region, and that holds a great deal of importance for the former. While the government of Pakistan pretends that it's business as usual, there's little joy about the latest US overtures to India, especially about giving the nuclear "edge" to Delhi. India has been, sort of, accepted as the "legitimate" nuclear power, whereas suspicions about Pakistan override any chance of acknowledgment of the same.Moreover, the traditional mindset of the Pakistani state is that the US has kept India away from Afghanistan, whereas it has been accepted by Pakistan that India's "intrusion" is creating problems in Afghanistan. However, in the backdrop of Obama's comments in India regarding Afghanistan, India is being viewed as having been conceded a "new" role, while Pakistan thought otherwise. As the US "abandoned" Pakistan after the exit of its forces in the 1990s, now the accusation is of the same being repeated. Back to the status quo of the pre-9/11, "forgotten" is Pakistan after its continued endorsement of and cooperation in the American war in Afghanistan. Pakistan's recent handing over of evidence to Washington of India's alleged involvement in terrorist activities in Pakistan via Afghanistan, while India is being accepted as a legitimate stakeholder by the US in Afghanistan is another issue that may have adverse effects on the geopolitical strategies in play. This shift in the Indo-US paradigm has, understandably, worried Pakistan, in view of the dynamics of a hostile India in Afghanistan. Obama's commitment to Modi to support India's bid for the UN Security Council permanent seat raises another serious concern for the state of Pakistan. If granted, the position will endow India with veto power, relegating the unresolved Kashmir issue to the backburner of international diplomacy. While Pakistan expects the US to wield diplomatic pressure on India to agree to a resolution of the issue, the UNSC seat, if acquired, would secure India against any such move. Another factor to be taken into consideration is that while the US and India intend to increase "connectivity, maritime, air and overland, in the region, including Central Asia", which would require transit through Pakistan, there has been almost no reference to the former in the joint statement. Without taking Pakistan on board, the trade route to Central Asia may not be easy to carve out from the template of thorny relations that Pakistan and India share at the moment. One positive element of the Obama-in-India discussion in Pakistan is the highlighting of the progress India has made in the recent years. The emergence of India as a new economic power  and a future regional leader is based on its structure of old and new economic and development plans to be implemented under the mentorship of its very dynamic, goal-oriented new premier. The packaging of India as the lucrative ground for investment, the clear-cut governance polices, Modi's international PR skills and the acceptance of need for reforms is noteworthy, and a model for all emerging economies.While media on both sides chant misplaced slogans of jingoism, scratching scabs and inflaming hostilities, the pragmatic view is the desire to have a renewed dialogue between Pakistan and India, in an effort to chalk out a framework that would work within the gamut of the capabilities of the two. The acknowledgment of India's superiority in terms of its size, population, resources, and economic, scientific and infrastructural development is not an acceptance of "defeat" for Pakistan, but the perquisite to forge a new dynamic in the region. The state-to-state interaction on multiple levels will ensure that the long-standing issues - Kashmir, Line of Control skirmishes, water disputes, Sir Creek and Siachen -- are brought to the negotiating table, in the absence of which peace in the region will remain an elusive dream. And this is where the US could play a very significant role: get Pakistan and India to talk, without one of them throwing a fit or staging a walkout. The world's sole superpower could be the moderator needed for the world's biggest democracy and the third-largest Muslim country.

Forget about moderation, no one will come to rescue you. Read simla agreement, Indo-Pak water treaty and then write. Remember, you people have tested our patients to great extent. Now no further accommodation. Our army will talk to you whenever we feel u r not in decorum. And if at all if you want to talk first you have to act sincerely.<br/><br/>

That begs the question....why on earth do you give space to such one-sided trash? She feels that Sir Creek and Siachen are unresolved? What resolution does she want there? And as for Kashmir, I would fervently hope that the Modi govt. limits all discussions on Kashmir to just PoK. That is the only unresolved part of the dispute, and we need to ensure that we get it back.

                            Madam, Here is a sound piece of advice for you...Be thorough with your history lessons before writing a long long article.<br/>
And for all the other things that you have enlisted, there is an adage I'd like to remind you about...As you sow, so shall you reap. <br/>
Pakistan trained terrorists on their soil to attack its neighbours, now when these snakes are biting you, you are crying foul and inviting people from all over the world to come and help you.

                            I think Modi will never talk with Pak until proxy war is stopped, current govt is very particular abt this atleast. Pak ppl shld be worried abt everything happening in their country first, their dummy democracy will never help them to develop and so much hate for India will further reduce them. Stp proxy war, do trade, this is wat Modi said when he became PM.

                            Coming to the point of exercising veto power in Security Council,let it be recalled that it was Prime Minister of Pakistan who had blocked all major resolutions in SAARC meeting in Kathmandu by using his membership  which indirectly mandated him with a sort of veto power to bring down resolutions on trade dealing for all member countries.Inspite of persuasion by all other members,Pak Premier did not withdraw his negative vote which watered  down major efforts towards growth of trade in South Asia.This is interpreted as misuse of power,which in SAARC meeting was almost equivalent to veto.

                            Ms Tarar, amused to read your article.Paksitan took upon itself the onerous task of driving out the Russians and in return suffered,influx of refugees, Kalshinkov culture,etc etc. Rest of the world believes, Pakistan did all this for money. Those days , Pakistan was the first country to realize it is much easier to earn coveted US dollars by providing mercenaries to Us efforts rather than earning them by exports of goods,a tough job in a competitive world. Then with Afghanistan there was that strange concept of strategic depth to be achieved for Pakistan.Thats a very funny idea when every body knows how fiercely independent Afghans are.

                            Pakistan,the nation,may perceive itself to be friend of the US,but almost every pakistani considers US to be an enemy. Where are you when frequent anti US protests are held in Pakistan? Many of these are nothing to do with Pakistan but perceived US role in the events in Syria or Palestine or Israel...the fact is pakistanis have a pathological hate for everything US ....except when an opportunity to emigrate there comes along.

                            What is missing from your article is the Abbotabad raid in Pakistan leading to Osama Bin Laden's death. He was found enjoying life in an isolated, well-defended compound. The compound was pretty close to a major military base.<br/>
This alone forces one to draw from the two possible conclusions:<br/>
1) Direct involvement with Bin Laden (negating valiant efforts mentioned above)<br/>
2) Incompetency (again, negating the many valiant efforts by Pakistan mentioned above)

                            Dear Mehr<br/>
Thanks for the essay. Unlike the Indian readers, I see some good arguments in it: If Pakistan understands, respects, and accept India´s superiority of size, wealth, etc, 90% of all problems between the two countries would melt away like snow of Switzerland in the month of May!<br/>
In order to achieve that Pakistan needs the following:<br/>
1. Immediately stop your proxy war in India and Bangladesh (Pakistan is responsible for a lot of political problems in Bangladesh)<br/>
2. Create a social order in your country based on universal civil code, rule of law, intellectualism, human dignity and respect and above all a true democracy not the sham version of it.<br/>
3. Send your military back to the barracks with immediate effect and send all the illiterate Imams to jail for preaching hate....make your mosques a center of love, peace, tolerance and harmony.<br/>
4. Ensure secular and modern education in all Pakistani schools, colleges, and universities<br/>
5. Liberate your women population and secure their social and financial ( and political ) role in the society.<br/>
The space won´t allow to prescribe more for your ailing country...just do the above, you and your children, grandchildren will live in eternal peace as proud Pakistanis. Today that is not a dream, but a daydream.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

                            I find it extremely disappointing when an elite of Pakistan, someone who Tharoor respected, blames the US for the problems resulting from the assistance Pakistan gave to the US to oust the Soviets from Afghanistan. Nowhere does she ask Pakistan to take responsibility, particularly the ISI. The ISI thought it was being super smart when it looted the US during the war and when it created the LeT. Pakistan's troubles result from its own stupidity. When the elite cannot point this out, perhaps out of fear, Pakistan is doomed.

                            I agree with her in that in India-USA relationship, Pakistan  is definitely out of the equation. Much of the relationship is about creation of jobs via commerce, trade and defence against any adventurism by countries like hers who really are bereft of any other occupation. What they are unable to draw from this event is how India has EARNED that respect and it's from a position of equality that USA  have come to partner with us.

                            This article only proves that Pakistan is squirming at the royal ignore given by India and US. India has time and again proven that it is better...at maintaining peace, at focussing on development, in its self sufficiency etc. The very existence of Pakistan is dependent upon attacking India overtly or covertly. Whereas India has shown that it has the pragmatism to invest in areas which will benefit the country. As for the writer saying "third largest muslim country", I wish to remind her that it is not an achievement. It is just demographics. India is the homeland of more muslims than in Pakistan.

                            Pakistan must realize that the whole World has moved forward when they stand still where they have been decades ago. The author admits that they have been hanging on with the US for too long &amp; claimed to have delivered everything US wanted them to do so. Hence, the feeling of letting them down now by the US sets in. They must realize that on the terror issue they have never fulfilled what the US wanted. Osama hiding in their soil was the best evidence. <br/><br/>
Leaving aside the size of India vis - a - vis Pakistan, the fact remains that India has become more relevant to the whole World. India had made so much progress in all areas &amp; have demonstrated that we mean business. There are Indian multi national companies across the World. Economics plays an important role in the World. As India lifts more from the poverty (we know that the journey is far too long), we need relationships across the World which allows us to pursue our goal.<br/><br/>
Issues like Kashmir, Siachin etc. cannot come in our way to our prosperity. Pakistan must lift themselves up from these India centric issues &amp; focus on what will make them relevant more in the World today. Barring China no one else is bothered about Pakistan. These are not due to India. It's unfortunate that no country even plays cricket within Pakistan. Unless Pakistan reboots itself as a sovereign nation &amp; positions itself relevant to the World, nothing will change.<br/><br/>

                            Of all people, I most support the fact that India and Pakistan must talk and resolve issues. But talk about what and talk with whom is a question. Kashmir is not the reason for Pakistans issues nor is it going to put food on a plate or give a young person a job. You need to understand how the world understands Pakistans history, raping and mistreating Bangladesh, terrible and current human rights violations in Baluchistan, corrupt govt, singular India centric narrative, supporting Taliban in Afghanistan, religious intolerance and murders of minorities going into the thousands. While we as a country are battling our own problems with Maoists, poverty, economy, energy and other issues. So in fact instead of buying more weapons and proliferating nukes to counter some phantom threat, if we worked to common problems, it would give a respite to regional geopolitics, to the people of Kashmir and last, not make ourselves a laughing stock in the world.

                            Whom should India talk to, in pakistan ? There are multiple power centers and army needs conflict with India to stay relevant in pakistan. Army wants greater share in power pie. They are in denial mode and consider terrorists as assets. I don't think pakistan is going to learn anything from very very very painful incidents like peshawar school attack.

                            Why US should mediate the discussions between India and Pakistan? India offered a very good gesture and Pakistan responded in typical nasty way. Discussion can happen when there are open minds rather than taking sides even before the discussion. It kept on happening with Pakistan.

                            i hope she reads this - the very main reason for her country's problems is the particular religion that is dominating that country. All countries with that religion as majority, have not had any good scientifc, technologicial, economic, artistic, educational acheivements of any sort. On the other hand, these countries are ravaged by barbaric elements and full of strife, suffering for women and minroties and generally life has been hell there. Think please, and do what you can to dismantle this religion from your country.

                            Two principles, not unrelated, are at work in Modi's very successful methodology (hallmarked, may I add?) to get out of a rut and onto an unconventional but productive plane; one is creative destruction and the other is learn, unlearn and relearn. If there are bruised egos and decimation of shibboleths along the way, so be it.

                            Pakistan is doing a Zarb-e-Azb in near Afghan border where very clear involvement of Indian Government has been found in many forms including currency and human interaction. It is not only India but US along with its own allies is in contact with these terrorists who are killing innocent citizens of Pakistan.<br/>
No doubt, it is a mistake of Pakistan establishment to launch a proxy war from its own soil.In the world, no one is exercising this kind of act but Pakistan can also follow their steps by nourishing like minded countries against Indian what you will do?<br/>
Kashmir is a very important on strategical border for Pakistan.Indian people become blind when we remind them UNO resolution to decide Kasmir's fate.India is under occupation and tolerance level can never be same. Leadership changes in Pakistan can bring India into a more troublesome position <br/>
Today, India is successful on the next day Pakistan will also adopt the same policy  of proxy in order to revenge but India will cry and guns, blasts never listens the mercy appeals.<br/>
In the end, India and Pakistan have to establish a relationship of resolution of this matter otherwise both countries have options
