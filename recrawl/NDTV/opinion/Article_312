Headline::::The Lakhvi Outrage



DateTime::::2014-12-18T21:18:00+05:30




                                (Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 14 books, including, most recently, Pax Indica: India and the World of the 21st Century.) The news of the release on bail of 26/11 plotter Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi by a Pakistani Anti-Terrorism Court today - at a time when the horror of the terror attack in Peshawar has barely sunk in - has shattered our faith in Pakistan's will to fight terrorism.India has always seen progress in the investigations and trial of seven Pakistanis accused of involvement in the Mumbai terror attack case as an important marker of Pakistan's commitment to combat terrorism emanating from its soil. But the case has moved at a glacial pace. The trial has been subject to repeated adjournments, non-appearances of lawyers, vacation of judges and frequent changes of prosecution lawyers, at least one of whom has mysteriously died. No judge has shown the slightest interest in moving the Lakhvi case towards a conviction.Meanwhile, Lakhvi, the principal accused, has been enjoying a comfortable life in prison, equipped with numerous cell phones from which he commands his followers. He has even fathered a child during his incarceration (though there are officially no conjugal rights for prisoners in Pakistan). Now he has been given bail, in what can only be interpreted as a decision by Islamabad that to fight the Tehrik-i-Taliban, they need the support of the Lashkar-e-Taiba. Between Mullah Fazlullah and Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, it seems, the Pakistanis have decided that Lakhvi, who only kills Indians, is better than Fazlullah, who relishes claiming the lives of Pakistanis, especially those in uniform. (So much for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's dismissal yesterday, in the wake of Peshawar, of the idea that there can be "good Taliban and bad Taliban".) There may well be no good Taliban, but for Islamabad, clearly, there are still good terrorists and bad terrorists. The Taliban are the bad ones, while Lakhvi is an asset, and with their backs to the wall, the ISI wants him on their side, not languishing comfortably in a jail for having killed 166 Indians.This sadly fits a pattern we have seen for too long. The principal conspirator of 26/11, Hafiz Saeed, roams freely around the country, making incendiary, hate-filled speeches against India, while the Government of Pakistan bleats that he has no case to answer. Worse, the banned organization he heads, Jamat-ud-Dawa, a "humanitarian" front for the Lashkar-e-Taiba, receives support, funding and patronage from the governments of both Pakistani Punjab (run by the Prime Minister's brother) and the Federal Centre. Just last week, Hafiz Saeed assembled five lakh fanatic followers in Muridke and exhorted them to pursue jihad against India. The Pakistan government actually laid on special trains so this rabid preacher of hatred could bring his bloodthirsty followers to his event. There is supposed to be a $10 million US bounty on information leading to his arrest, but though everyone in Pakistan knows where he is - his rallies are advertised in advance like those of any politician - no one has stepped forward to claim it. (And given the billions of dollars the US pays Pakistan to shore up its national security institutions - which in turn protect and encourage Hafiz Saeed - the 10 million wouldn't go very far anyway.)Lakhvi has been in jail for nearly six years because of Indian and American efforts in the aftermath of 26/11. By showing restraint after 26/11, ignoring the calls of hotheads for airstrikes and missile launches, and by pressuring the US to work on its near-bankrupt clients in Islamabad -- who have received some $11 billion in military assistance since 9/11, ostensibly to fight Islamist terror but much of it spent on those who have fomented such terror -- India briefly achieved real results. Under US pressure, the Pakistani leadership arrested some 20 militants, including Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the reputed operational mastermind of the Mumbai horror, and in February 2009 released a report finally admitting that five of the attackers were Pakistani. This was an important first step, but it did not go far enough: there are still too many evasions and denials in Islamabad, including the suggestion that the attacks were masterminded elsewhere than Pakistan. With today's bail news, even that limited success has collapsed.Even those house arrests and nominal bannings are not enough for Indians: we have seen this movie before. The Lashkar was banned in 2001 -- by General Musharraf under duress after 9/11 -- only to re-emerge as the ostensibly humanitarian group, the Jamaat-e-Dawa, and in that guise is even more powerful than before. Its head, Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, remained free to preach vitriolic hatred against India in his Friday sermons and to serve, at the very least, as a catalyst for murder and mayhem in our country. New Delhi has been rightly insisting that Islamabad crack down completely on these militant groups, dismantle their training camps, freeze their bank accounts (not, as Musharraf did, with enough notice for them to be emptied and transferred to other accounts operated by the same people) and arrest and prosecute their leaders. Though there is little appetite in Pakistan for such action, the UN Sanctions Committee under Resolution 1267 did proscribe the Jamaat-ud-Dawa and impose travel bans and asset freezes on specific named individuals, including Saeed. China, which had opposed such a move when the US and the UK had proposed it in 2006, supported it in 2008 - a clear indication that in the wake of the Mumbai horrors, it judged that such pro-Pakistani obstruction would no longer be compatible with its role as a responsible leader of the international system. The sanctions had remained in place till today.What is essential is to sustain the pressure: the granting of bail makes that impossible now. I had hoped that one positive thing might come out of the unspeakable tragedy in Peshawar - that it might give the semi-secular moderates in Pakistan the opportunity to crack down upon the extremists and murderers in their midst, in their own interest. Then, I thought, the suffering of a few hundred families in India on 26/11 might not be replicated in the lives of other Indians at the hands of these evil men in the years to come. Sadly, the regime in Islamabad has gone the other way - for them, India's enemies are their friends, against their "real" enemies on the Afghan border.Continued terrorism from Pakistan and areas under its control remains a core concern for India. It is critical for India and also for the security of the region that Pakistan shows determined action to dismantle all terrorist networks, organisations and infrastructure within its own territory. Releasing one set of terrorists on bail while going after another suggests that for Pakistan some terrorists are still an "asset".What the Lakhvi release means, sadly, is that for India, the time has not yet come to let down our guard with Pakistan.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Normal Indians have never put faith in anything that Pakistan does or say but its you whole bunch of politicians and media who forced your words in our mouth. Ask any Indian civilian how they want to treat Pakistan and see how much time you politicians waste in talking, talking and just talking.

                            Very perceptive indeed although there is nothing that you have written which all Indians don't know of or aren't aware of albeit very implicitly. We try and console ourselves that the wolves in that country would become lambs because another tribe of wolves is slaughtering it. But that's farthest from the truth it can ever get. Wolves never lose their appetite. Once they overpower the other tribe they are going to turn back on us because we've proven to be the proverbial lambs. The only way out is to let the Wolf know that there's a lion waiting on this side if the fence. And it means we need to take out a couple of big wolves ourselves ! Are we up to it? Or shall we keep deluding ourselves in the play of history which now ,more than ever demands us to be power players!

                            Pervez Musharraf blamed India for the Peshawar school killings. (As of now, this has not yet appeared on this site.) It shows their mentality. They still have a lot to learn about their "good terrorists". Actually, they started doing this in Kashmir in 1947 itself. Earlier, Jinnah threatened "rivers of blood". All this needs to be unlearnt. I wonder how long it will take.

I hope Mr. Mullah Mani Shankar writes an article on this!<br/>
I know for sure he will not! His payment from Pakistan will stop!<br/>
He can write against PM Modi as if he is an international terrorist!<br/>
But Mullah Mani Shankar wont write against Paki terrorists!<br/>
He wants talk with them! :)

Another secular diggy is perhaps busy with the new toy of his daughter's age. Another Moron is perhaps busy with writing another column as to why Pappu is the best thing that happened to India and how we need to talk to Pakistan. Where is the massive outrage in this country?

                            India now has limited options. They must endure the pain of a thousand cuts and bleed endlessly (at the cost of our own dignity and pride) or stand up once and for all and take the fight to Lahore (like in 1965) but this time to settle matters once and for all. There should be no fear of a nuclear threat, these cowards are petrified of their own extinction. We can bear a one time pain but eliminate the constant nuisance that our fututure generations may have to bear. We owe it to them.

                            A good opinion from an intelligent congress. Here are my thoughts on this and I hope whoever is affected will understand what politicians can do.<br/><br/>
You have two terror outfits one for you and one for your neighbor. Don't you realize that you are breeding two human eating beasts in your home. Human beings irrespective or color, race or religion are God's children and is never discriminated by GOD. <br/><br/>
The reasons for this act of stupidity can be attributed to lack of education and values of life. Since these ill informed and illiterate beasts have no education and no respect for themselves, and supported by politicians, a common man will never see the light of the day for a safe and peaceful life on this planet.<br/><br/>
I want to digress a bit, please forgive me. If the world at large can impose sanctions on a world leader for his political stupidity, and bring him to a level of sanity, why not do the same to those leaders who harbor these beasts of terrorism.<br/><br/>
There is one solution we all know but no one wants to do anything especially the world leaders. Stop feeding these beasts with arms and ammunition through whatever source, impose sanctions against the countries and make them accountable for their acts. Save the humans who want peace and growth and help build universal peace and kindness.<br/><br/>
I know i am not professing anything new, and as a common man, I thought this may raise awareness to those who believe in what they preach for peace.

                            Terrorism in pakistan has long been and continues to be used as an instrument of state policy. The ideological motivation comes from a depraved islamic fantasy of a world islamic empire headquartered in the land of ignorant beduins. These terrorists and their handlers are after power and pelf but (fortunately) they represent a defeated civilization which is never coming back. <br/>
Islamic terrorists have infiltrated the armed services which is a concern for the senior officers. These islamic terrorists also have a nexus with political parties. If pakistan continues in its duplicitious approach to islamic terrorism then it must be isolated with economic sanctions regionally and internationally. And a strategic military force must be formed to undertake physical measures to take out these islamic monsters from their nests.

                            It was your Jawaharlal Nehru whose faggotory relations with Jinnah gave birth to tolerance of these issues and Pakistan's existence. Such aggressions have always been brushed under the carpet in the name of 'bilateral talks'. Congress has been hiding under the stupid cover of talks since last 3 decades. While such issues could have been put to rest relatively easily earlier (because Pakistan was not a nuke country) it is equally difficult now. Now you write an article?

                            Lakhvi being granted bail just shows that the fundamentalists and other fanatics have a strong hold in all Pakistani system. It seems that Pakistani government is unable to stop these terrorist elements from penetrating more and more into the government agencies including defence. The worrying part for India is that Pakistan has many nuclear warheads as well as delivery systems. If fanatic elements penetrate high in defence they may force use of these weapons against India. I think our government should first offer active help to Pakistani government to eradicate these elements from there and if Pakistan does not response appropriately India should use force to remove the terrorist elements from Pakistani system. Otherwise a day may come when Pakistani nuclear warheads will destroy Indian cities.
