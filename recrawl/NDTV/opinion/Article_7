Headline::::Congratulations, BJP, On Creating The Kanhaiya Kumar Phenomenon



DateTime::::2016-03-05T14:22:00+05:30




                                Two hours after being released from prison, a smiling, clean-shaven JNU Students Union President Kanhaiya Kumar made an hour-long speech to a throng of thousands of students and became a nationwide political star.
With his compelling fluency and brilliant rhetoric, his impish smile and sardonic humour, his mastery of idiomatic Hindi and his manifest sincerity, Kanhaiya seems to represent the idealism and passion long felt to be absent in the political class. In explicit contrast to the practised and cynical politicians running the nation, he offers an authentic voice of the people.
The son of a farmer and a mother who makes 3000 rupees a month, with a soldier brother risking his life at the front, Kanhaiya spoke from the heart of what the country meant to him, and one could not but listen. Videos of his speech have gone viral across the length and breadth of the country and among the Indian diaspora. There is no question: everyone who heard him did so with rapt admiration, and most were moved.
Most Indians, too, felt themselves suffused with a genuine pride in Indian democracy for having produced a Kanhaiya Kumar.
Someone with none of the conventional advantages - born without a spoon, let alone a silver one! - had been able to rise, through merit, scholarships and free institutions, to one of the nation's premier universities, and to speak the way he did. It was difficult not to see his life story, his elective position, his confidence and dissent as the epitome of Indian democracy at its best.
The BJP government should be kicking itself, since its heavy-handed crackdown on the campus has created the Kanhaiya phenomenon. The foolish arrest, the slapping of preposterous sedition charges, the even more absurd (and easily discredited) attempt to disgrace Kanhaiya and his friends through the circulation of doctored videotapes of their demonstration - all have made a martyr out of Kanhaiya Kumar. They have also given him the platform, and the national media attention, to deliver the stinging critique of the government that has catapulted him to political stardom.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has suddenly acquired a major problem. His carefully cultivated political persona is not designed to face off against somebody like Kanhaiya. The boy totally disarms Mr Modi's claim to "ordinariness". (The PM's narrative of having sold tea faces that of a student who could barely afford a cup of tea.) He has even co-opted the police, the government's dreaded enforcers, by pointing out that constables have the same social background as him and share his views on issues, rather than those of the government.
And then there's Kanhaiya himself, the darling son of every Indian mother (especially after his shave, which has restored youthful innocence to his face). His oratory, the way he switches registers and vocabularies so nimbly, his lack of rancour or self-pity, his cheekiness, his courage, his eloquence - he matches, arguably even defeats, Mr Modi. The BJP suddenly realizes it is ruling an India which requires the devotees of Krishna Kanhaiya to make room for Kanhaiya Kumar.
Kanhaiya Kumar has already, at the age of 28, become the political phenomenon the Communist movement has sorely lacked. His eloquence could single-handedly revive the moribund Communist Party of India (CPI). It seems he has already been conscripted into campaigning for the party in the forthcoming State Assembly elections in West Bengal and Kerala, two states where the CPI still has a tenuous presence and candidates to field.
He is the Sitaram Yechury of his generation - the brave student leader, also from JNU, of the 1970s, who stunned the nation by his courageous defiance of the Government, spoke Truth to Power, and went on to rise to the top of his party. If Kanhaiya weren't just 28, he might even have been catapulted onto the national stage already with a Rajya Sabha seat from Kerala, where the CPI is entitled to a seat this year - but you have to be at least 30 to be elected to the Upper House, so Kanhaiya will have to wait.
The irony is that for all this, Kanhaiya has placed his undeniable idealism and sincerity at the service of a discredited ideology that has been repudiated everywhere in the world except in a handful of pockets in our country. He speaks feelingly of democracy and freedom but belongs to a party that believes in dictatorship. He upholds a constitution his ideology deems bourgeois, and demands rights that would be denied to all Indians by the practitioners of the Gulag and Tiananmen Square. He rejects the power of the state but does so on behalf of a movement that has used violence, brutality and even murder to advance its cause in Kerala and elsewhere.
Kanhaiya represents a voice of hope and aspiration - but he toils in the service of a party that opposed the introduction of computers into India (and smashed the first ones to be installed in government offices), denounced the entry of mobile phones as a toy for the rich (whereas nothing has empowered the Indian underclass more than the mobile phone), and consistently obstructs every progressive reform that would pull the poor out of poverty. His party, moored in a 19th century ideology, is manifestly unsuited to 21st century India.
What Kanhaiya Kumar stands for to most Indians transcends the party he has pledged his allegiance to. One can only hope that he is not reduced to a CPI apparatchik, a slave to an ideology and a political party that deserves to be rejected at the polls.
Kanhaiya legitimizes the dissent of ordinary Indians against the trends being promoted by the BJP government. One can only pray that one day he will rise above the platform he has inherited from two generations of CPI leaders in his family, and truly speak for the millions of Indian democrats he has now inspired.(Dr Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Dear Mr Tharoor - Your article is good enough to suggest who's fanning the Kanhaiya phenomenon......it also draws a parallel to the Hardik Patel phenomenon, which is obviously also being wholly supported by media bed fellows to try and create an alternative leader who can dent Mr. Modi's stage presence, which your party VP just is not able to measure upto. Sorry.

                            In Indian context, CPI and CPI (M) are DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS. I would challenge Tharoor to a debate where in the world DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS are in decline? They are either ruling parties or main opposition in many many countries in Europe, Americas and Africa. It's right-wing (like BJP/Cong) who are in decline!

                            I know these idiots keep racking up stupid controversies. I swear if Modi doesn't get his act and his cabinet together soon he's going down the drain. Why does he keep inexperienced people like Rajnath Singh in his cabinet?  And when these things pop up he keeps quiet. What goes through his mind I truly wonder. Does he want to lose on purpose or what? He worked so hard to get a majority in parliament and now he is doing such.

                            Mr. Tharoor come out of Fool's paradise.Its laughable that you are trying to portray this convict a hero.Registrar of JNU has confirmed that Kahnaiya was not only new about the Martyrdom day of Afzal Guru program but had protested on cancelling by the JNU authorities.He was not only present in the program but as a leader of AISF did not stop other students to shout anti India slogans.This guy is a Naxalite and has Maoist ideology deep rooted and found only place in bihar called begusarai, from where he hails.Giving conditional interim bail Court's observations are very strong and clear.To save his skin Kahnaiya has taken 180 degree turn now swearing by the Constitution. Kahnaiya's ideology has No takers in real modern progressive India, more so as he is heading an anti India &amp; maoist ideology with sedition charges slapped on his head.Also media particularly NDTV should also come of Fool's paradise and do a reality check and should not hurt sentiments of its citizens.

                            Basic characters required for Politics are Honesty, integrity, simplicity, compassion which are abundant with most of the Left leaders say 90% .The people having these traits will naturally attracts towards the left movement. In other parties we may be having 10 to 30% of these kind of people and rest belongs to corrupt, casteist, religious extremism etc. Yes left is lagging in glamour and opportunism. Imagine when the world was created or formed the land, air, water,sky and natural wealth belonged to every one without disparity. Earlier these has been dis-proportionated by physical power ,now by business. Left will never die and will rise from ashes every time whenever  exploitation happens<br/><br/>

                            In the name of studies, students leaders are mostly local goondas who have failed multiple years in the same class and don't want to pass out either. JNU campus and its students union looks the same thing as if all over the country. Also, raising slogans against India and equating this with freedom of speech is unacceptable. One's poor background doesn't give you the licence to wage war against India. This is the ideology of Maoists who are outlaws, violent and against the idea of India. What is the difference between these students unions, its leaders and the Maosists. If you want to contribute to the country, study hard, go out and work. But you don't do that. You indulge in high drama and double standards. It is not at all surprising to see that he will join Left politics, milk the students and live a lavish goondagardi life. Just another Leftist commy who had supported China during the Indo-China war.

I would like to have azaadi from left and Congress ... Left b'coz they hv destroyed Bengal in their 34 years of misrule and Congress b'coz they hv similarly destroyed and looted India for the last 60 years.<br/><br/>
Kanhaiya has no experience of the true character of left parties ... they hv looted, raped, murdered n terrorised people for not voting for them, destroyed n vandalized public property n industries for not paying them protection money. <br/><br/>
I would definitely not want to live in kanhaiyas ideological azad country.

                            Don't worry, Mr. Tharoor. He is going to hurt you (Congress) and TMC more than BJP. <br/><br/>
Left now remains in only three states - Kerala (Left Vs Congress), WB (Left Vs TMC) and Tripura (Left Vs Congress). So raise of so called new leader would hurt first Congress and TMC than BJP.<br/><br/>
So don't be laugh on BJP. It has played its game very well. <br/>
On issue of JNU, <br/>
1. BJP's entire ground workers sena have been energized<br/>
2. Entire debates of 'Secular' and 'Communal' now turns towards 'Nationalist' and 'Anti-nationalist' which is more advantages to BJP than earlier loss of secularism debate <br/>
3. Many media channels and also big names in Indian media have been completely exposed in this game. People came to know about reporting bias of all channels and it would be advantage to BJP in coming years<br/>
4. Left has energized once again which is going to hurt TMC &amp; Congress more than BJP. Both - TMC &amp; Congress are creating more problems to BJP than Left. <br/><br/>
So don't be laugh.....think and then comment who is going to suffer more by raise of Left. In not a single state, BJP has direct fight with Left...

                            Well, in one of his interview, he said that the ideology is not wrong but the form in which the ideology is delivered is wrong and needs changes. So he is level-headed. He accepts that the way CPI functions is not right. And it takes guts to accept his own party's mistakes. I don't see many politicians accepting the faults/forms of their parties. In that regards, he is more matured that many senior politicians in this country. Having said that, he is still a student. It is too early to say whether his innocence, sincerity and enthusiasm as student will remain as he grows older.

In other parties we may be having 10 to 30% of these kind of people and rest belongs to corrupt, casteist, religious extremism etc. Yes left is lagging in glamour and opportunism. Imagine when the world was created or formed the land, air, sky and natural wealth belonged to every one without disparity. Earlier these has been disproportinated by physical power ,now by business. Left will never die and will rise from ashes everytime when exploitation happens<br/><br/>

                            Truly, has a way with words. A rare talent, Kanhaiya. Exceptional flourish. Partly god-gifted, partly his political science study and partly his sincerity. Also remember Rohith Vemula's awe-inspiring suicide letter. He must have bee a genius too. Imagine, if only Rohith had been saved... the two combined would have been a very potent force.

                            While Modi's oratory (Hindi) has been negative in content-Jamai Raja, Shehzade et al- Kanhaiya's oratory is refreshing for lack of negativism and full of positives, though his dislike of the fascists of India is both understandable and deserves encomiums

                            If the communist ideology is "discredited" and "moribund" to you Mr Tharoor, what about that of your own party? Do you even have an ideology anymore? A party whose members wine and dine with caviar and cabernet and then claim to represent those who cant even afford a glass of clean water? And do you forget that even in the sober moments that your party sometimes has, the schemes that it introduces such as the NREGA were all original communist ideas?<br/><br/>
We don't need lectures from a party which (to reverse phrase Mr Shourie) is just the BJP without the cow.

                            Remember Anna Hazare? Remember Prashant Bhushan? Remember Yogendra Yadav? Remember HD Devegowda? Remember V.P Singh? All of these are (few) example of meteoric media attention, focus, where are they? in comparison to their previous status? All of them were celebrity before also. Look at Anna Hazare !! Entire media live telecasted his release from Tihar. He was international celebrity as well. Now what? My point is, that this is media creation. And any media creation doesn't have shelf life. Anna Hazare was more respected earlier due to his work at ground level. But post Arvind Kejriwal he lost sheen and credibility as well. If he goes for similar fasting and movement today, the support will no where close to what he received earlier. It takes decades to rise. And any meteoric rise will more likely meet sudden fall as well. Once media removes spotlight then? The exception is Mr. Kejriwal, you can say. But let media remove attention from him and see, what happens to him.

                            The BJP had everything in its kitty, a brutal majority in LOksabha, most state governments tuning their political line, dispirited and directionless  opposition , cheap oil etc etc . They could have done wonders to the development and self pride of Indians. They wasted everything.  They spent their energy on dividing Indians. It was felt knowingly or unknowingly that they were trying to focus on a certain section of people,  minorities and caste . I still feel that it is not the Prime Minister or his ministerial colleagues who have contributed to this image, but the Sangh parivar organisations and their representatives, may be deliberately, in order to keep the prime minister in check.  They have even tried to bring military versus common people phenomenon with the help of some TV channels. Now it seems Manmohan Singh was far better. I feel sad and demoralized about what is happening in the country.  Once you are the winner, you need to accommodate the loser and take care of the nation as a whole.

                            Brilliant speech! As a student union leader I hope he will bring balance to both the extreme right and left.  'Freedom of Speech' is not unlimited freedom to create trouble to the society that has given you the freedom. I totally agree with his 'Aazadi inside India' - but what is practiced by some sections of JNU is not 'Aazadi inside India'; it's 'Aazadi from India' and misuse of tax payers money. That is misusing the freedom of speech guaranteed by the constitution of India. I hope Mr. Kanhaiya Kumar who has a bright future ahead of him will use his intellect to create a better India and not follow the path of some of his brilliant predecessors who wasted their intellect on rhetoric and almost zero contribution to the betterment of the society.<br/><br/>
I wish Mr. Modi would rein in his extreme right wing elements. In reality these extreme right wing elements are his biggest enemy. They will bring him down. He doesn't need congress and other opposition parties. He should remember that he and his party has approval from only 31 % of the eligible voters in India! 69% did not vote for him.

West Bengal has been a den of such student politics; no one has found a good job or respect in India or elsewhere. Some have been lucky to have some photos clicked with some chief minister or a Panchayat leader. <br/><br/>

Also as rightly pointed out, Communist too have to move with time and change their ideology and thinking to suit the needs of current times. An appropriate mix would be Bhagat Singhs socialism combined with Ambedkars Social justice.

                            Create a atmosphere in your party. Remove corruption in order to create space for honest people in your party. You too can have Kanhaiyas in Congress party. Secondly a person of your status with all the resources to read and buys books should understand the historical, political and the circumstantial compulsion of the time leading to the phenomena of Gulag and Tianenmen rather than using them loosely to defame someone attempting to make a better world. May be a result of western propaganda which you were subjected to.

                            Dear Mr Tharoor. You find Kahaiya speech brilliant!!? It was nothing but full of drama. Congi and left are behind this. They want to destroy Modi's popularity among students. I don't know why you are wasting your talent in this party. You don't belong there. Media and opposition parties are dancing with joy as they have found their next pawn against Modi. Disruption inside parliament and all this fake drama outside will ultimately hound you. People are not fools they will see through ultimately😁

                            Kanhaiya is in every Indian who wants freedom from hunger, freedom from exploitation by the rich, freedom from the false divisions created by the politicians, last of all and the most important of all, freedom from the politics of hate. It is wrong to say that he belongs to any political party, he represents and belongs to all Indians.

                            Mr Tharoor, No matter what media does at the end of the day truth will prevail. Look at Arvind Kejriwal who turned into useless CM who knows only barking all the time.<br/><br/>
His own friends who started Lokpal agitation left him after knowing his true intentions.<br/><br/>
At the same time you lost your credibility when you joined corrupt congress and in fact the disease even infected you unfortunately.<br/><br/>
Now there is no cure for corruption disease.

                            Kanhaiya living in fools paradise. A speech full of flaws. The speech heavily exposes his shortcomings. In a country of more than one billion, definitely there will be many fools who fail to account his shortcomings and be lured by his flawed speech, wanting to share their space in the same paradise. lol !!! Also someone like rohit who suicided is his hero ??? Seriously ??? Generally people who suicide are considered cowards. But again the wise can easily understand that this fellow Kanhaiya has changed his goal post from Afzal to Rohit, hence he is very tactical in dealing with the situation he is in. And he is talking about farmer's condition and the hanging of Afzal, both of which are due to the rules and conditions that existed since the last 60 years of Congress rule, and the execution was done during Congress party rule. Its just an absolute shameless, flawed speech which the paid media has glorified to the hilt.

                            Such effusive praise is uncalled for..to the extent that he suggests Lord krishna takes second place in front of this suspected anti-national..congress will sell their country,god and parents just to get power back..

                            What has the communists achieved anything except for blood-shed and utter chaos??? They could never eradicate poverty. Else West Bengal would have been after their uninterrupted 37 years of rule. No Jobs as well !! <br/>
They shout all slogans - always anti-establishment!! And when in establishment all they do is to unleash a reign of terror and violence to annihilate what they perceived as Class enemies. And they talk of FREEDOM!! They are the worst enemies of human-rights and freedom when given political power. <br/>
Freedom for unleashing such violence all across India??? Huhh...No wonder, support is pouring out for the Congress's ideological sisters. And Congress's pet socialist-left model has also failed!! Isn't it? Else why was the need to open up the economy in 1991??<br/>
Their ideology to is to annihilate classes to establish a social order which they hold it very close to their hearts - a reflection of initial sloganeering which we saw in JNU. These cowards when faced by law, they profess allegiance to the constitution and rant freedom slogans!!  What a Joke?? <br/>
Its not surprising that opposition like the Congress will rally behind anything or anybody which has even a whimp of Anti-Modi!! For your hatred for one man, you don't mind extending support to those ideologies who have time and again put even the worst of fascists to utter shame!!

                            What a dumb article. Morally and factually wrong at so many levels. The observationd are just so misleading and completely out of proportion. It's not BJP who made him phenomenon, it's congress and people like you who made Afzal Guru phenomenon <br/>
Another desperate attempt by Congress's moron to glorify negativity. It's sad state is already visible by the leaders like Rahul Gandhi, and the people who follow them. Shashi Tharoor, you're back to what you've always been - a sad Con artist. Well, I guess that's what it takes to join congress party. Hope you'll soon be behind bars for murder of your wife

                            One does not have to read Tharoor's column the tone and tenor is predictable. However, Kanhaiya sadly follows the wrong ideology and that has been a failure all over the world and nearer home in West Bengal where institution after institution was destroyed in 34 years of absolute misrule. Besides curiously Kanhaiya has turned turtle on his stand, today he suddenly is singing hosannas to the Indian state, which he was running down on tv channels immediately after February 9 thereby confirming the events on that day , surely because of the public backlash and he had to run to the same judiciary for succor. Tharoor and his party's stand is predictable because they are so badly marginalized politically that they will hang on to the coat tails of anyone who can hold out hope and promise for a better tomorrow even though it might be a mirage. It seems that Kanhaiya despite his oratorical promise is increasingly looking like a media hero albeit of a section only, the public sentiment across the country is still very much against those who organized the February 9 event at JNU which includes Kanhaiya.

                            "everyone who heard him did so with rapt admiration, and most were moved....". Any guesses for who is 'everyone'? NDTV and the national media out to topple the govt and get back to the good old days when they could 'fix' govts and ministers! the only two highlights of his speech are (a) 'social equality' as if it is  flip of a switch and moreover,characters like these belong to the commie cadre as you rightly pointed out expecting the Govt to subsidise them in their married life as well by providing jobs,while they dont want to do anythign meaningful for themselves or the country. For starters, let him find a job (if someone gives him one!!) which pays more than the 3000rs his parents earn and which he unashamedly uses as a crutch, this will give an idea on what work means! (b) using his parents 3000Rs (which even shashi is moved to tears) so flippantly whenever a probing question is asked of him.India has enough of talkers, we need solutions...
