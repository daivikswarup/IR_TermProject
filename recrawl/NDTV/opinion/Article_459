Headline::::How Afzal Guru, Alam Were Turned Into Martyrs



DateTime::::2015-03-17T19:21:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha)
	In the week that has seen Mahatma Gandhi's statue being unveiled beside Winston Churchill's in London's Westminster Square, the question surely arises: what do governments gain by jailing political dissidents? Certainly, in the end, Gandhi, the convict, won and Churchill, the jailer, lost. Ditto Nelson Mandela, whose statue also stands in the same square. Home Ministers who arrest those they do not like might win temporary kudos, but inevitably, a term in prison enhances rather than diminishes an activist's reputation among his present and potential followers. It does not snuff out the cause for which he seeks incarceration.
	 
	With judicial hanging, the impact is even more decisive. Bhagat Singh remains an icon. Afzal Guru, who in his lifetime was a marginal player, has now acquired cult status as a martyr among his growing band of followers. His remains remain buried in an obscure, unmarked grave in Delhi's prison grounds, but memorials to him are being erected in the hearts of many, many Kashmiris. We have offered a hostage to fortune by hanging him - and hanging on to what is left of him.
	 
	There are only two ways of resolving disputes: the authoritarian way of putting away the other side on the principle of 'out of sight, out of mind'; or the democratic way of discussion, dialogue, negotiation. The problem with the former is that 'out of sight' does not take away from the mind's eye. Indeed, the silenced one put away from his followers gains immensely by being portrayed (and portraying himself) as one prepared to be punished for his beliefs - especially when he cheerfully accepts his punishment and even urges the unjust judge to be as severe in unjust judgement as the unjust law provides. The world discovered this in 1922 when Gandhiji was arraigned in front of the Ahmedabad district sessions court judge. At Gandhiji's instance, the poor man pronounced the harshest sentence possible, but then, in open court, expressed the hope that the executive would see fit to reduce or remove the sentence. Gandhi at that moment emerged as the Mahatma, not only in the eyes of his followers (who had long regarded him a Mahatma) but to an ever-widening world-wide circle of admirers that has now resulted in the irony of Gandhi standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the same Churchill who had once denounced him as a "seditious fakir", under the benign gaze of the same Parliament where Churchill had so traduced him!
	 
	Afzal Guru would not have attained martyrdom status if he had been found guilty of a palpable crime, as Ajmal Kasab was. There was simply no doubt in anyone's mind - not even Kasab's - that he was guilty as charged. In Afzal's case, the case against him was fuzzy, so fuzzy that first the High Court discarded much of the evidence against him as being unproved or improperly obtained, followed by the Supreme Court relying exclusively on "circumstantial evidence" to sentence him to death avowedly to satisfy the "collective conscience" of the country. It led to a collective howl of disapproval in the Valley that propelled the PDP to a massive win in Kashmir in the December  2014 election. Since death cannot be reversed, even the PDP's arch opponent, the National Conference, demands the return to the family of the remains for a proper burial, a demand repeatedly endorsed by Omar Abdullah personally. While the issue festers, Afzal is perhaps as widely regarded as a martyr in Kashmir as he is regarded as a murderer in the rest of India. Keeping his remains in Delhi only causes the wounds in the Valley to fester further.
	 
	Temporary peace might be bought by keeping Alam incarcerated or Afzal's remains buried under an unidentified mound in Tihar. But a lasting solution to the challenge of Kashmir's emotional integration  with India can come only through engagement. Of course, we will never succeed in changing the minds of hard-liners like Alam and Afzal, nor will they in bringing us round to their view. That is not the point of negotiation. The more germane goal would be to expose them as "unreasonable" to a larger public - if our cause is just. Delhi must reveal itself as "reasonable" to the people of Kashmir. That is the litmus test, failing which stones will be thrown in Srinagar while detention "advisories" are drafted in Delhi.
	 
	The three-person Interlocutors group, led by Dileep Padganokar and comprising Radha Kumar and MM Ansari, opened the gates to dialogue. Delhi has since refused to walk through the gate, giving the excuse to the separatists to do likewise. It is out of the question that the Hurriyat will simple go away, or that Alam will lose his young stone-pelters, or that the dead Afzal will lose his sheen. They have to be shackled with words, not fetters.
	 
	However, progress will not happen in a political vacuum. Unfortunately, what we have today in the State is a political vacuum with two incompatibles embracing each other opportunistically to come to power together - only to exercise power against each other. Optimists see in this unprincipled coalition the hope that the gulf between Jammu and Kashmir will be bridged. Realists would argue that a bridge cannot be jointly built if one party is building the bridge even as the other is bringing it down. There has to be engagement across the spectrum from RS Pura to Kargil, but we do not have engagement even between the two halves of the State government. That is why the first few weeks of the government have been so fragile. Differences are papered over only to burst wide open at the first move by either half.
	The longer such a government lasts the more harm it will do before it finally bows out - which, as in the case of the similarly constituted Janata government of 1977-79, will happen sooner than later. Another election has to be held - perhaps before the year ends. One can only hope that would throw up a House united, not divided, as this one is, against itself.
	 
	Obviously the same cannot be said of a militant as wedded to violence as Masarat Alam, but there is no gainsaying that far from reducing his following, every jailing weds his circle of followers, The paradox is that very attempt to cut him to size merely make shim grow higher. He is a more formidable opponent in jail than is outside.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            blah blah blah. I can understand the itchiness of your fertile brain Mr. Mani but please try to write something which makes sense. Don't write just for the sack of writing. By the way you do write really good when it comes to praising fake gandhi family. It seems all congress veterans have run out of striking issues at the minute and therefore digging graves.

                            OK, you have stated the problem. What is the solution? No country can afford to let its citizens - unwilling or not - get away with treason, sedition or terrorism. Action has to be taken as per law. If they become heroes or martyrs in the view of their misguided followers, so be it. This has always been the problem with dealing with rebels of any color. Talking about it will not make the problem go away. Punishment is necessary and has to be dealt out as per law. The unity and integrity of the country cannot be compromised. Ask Indira Gandhi.

It's you and your Govt who created all situation... Both the situation to unrest Valley and the situation of Afzal Guru. Are you trying to take a blame on you.

                            Hello Aiyare, Afzal Guru attained martyrdom when Congress gave a letter of apology for a narrow and petty political gain of one RS seat barely a month back.  If this is not opportunistic, then what else?  Don't accuse your opposition of opportunistic when you people have already done it shamelessly.  You Hippocrates...

                            Wow! All that Doon School, St Stephens and Cambridge education has led to Aiyar comparing Guru to Gandhi! What Aiyar fails to note is that one was a non-violent agitator, while the other was, at best, sympathetic to murderers.  Guru was hanged after due process, the basis on which democracy exists.  Guru and his colleagues never for a moment considered that the lives of our Indian brethren were of supreme value to us; to Guru, these lives were, at best, expendable.  It is the actions of 5th columnists like Aiyar that led to the quagmire of Kashmir in which India is trapped.  Indecisive leaders like Nehru and his followers have extracted from India an astronomically high price in blood and treasure.  In such a situation, we do not need airy fairy academics like Radha Kumar, more used to preening herself in TV studios rather than scraping the guts of our martyred soldiers from the borders they defend.  Instead of defending those who seek to behead our soldiers and indulge in 'ethnic cleansing' the valley of our Pundits, Aiyar should reflect and be grateful that he lives in a country where he can spew venom against anybody he targets.  It is fortunate that some of us regard him as a retired babu who was always greasy in appearance, always snivelling in behaviour, constantly grovelling to the Gandhi parivar, often appearing on Pakistani TV and generally making a nuisance of himself.  Decisive leaders like Modi who will, given time, rid Kashmir of every one who choses not to be an Indian is the only way forward.

                            Aiyer said: "Gandhi at that moment emerged as the Mahatma". False. Historically. Aiyer believes that India has only 2 sets of people: the good guys on Nehru-Gandhi and the bad guys on Modi-Rss side. The name "Mahatma" was given in 1915 by Dwijendranath (Rabindranath's brother) and not in 1922 as Aiyer said. However, Aiyer is correct and many citizens surprised at the BJP-PDP alliance. But then, we need to take decisive actions against Alam and their kind of people regardless of what their followers would believe (wrongly, of course).

Probably, he is reading all comments on his article, unlike what he said in one of the articles that he doesn't read. In this case also, he is pretentious, hypocrite and psuedo.

                            Mani Shankar Iyer forgets that the root of the Kashmir dispute lies in his leader, Pt.

                            Mr Aiyer what stopped your party from solving the Kashmir problem politically? Having served in Kashmir for over 10 years and having many Kashmiri friends I know they are aware that being with India benefits them the most. That is why terrorism that flourished in the nineties lost its support among those who benefitted from tourism and development. Sadly instead of building on that politics for power took precedence over a political solution. Today we have the best chance of achieving that solution with a coalition between a Kashmiri party and a national one. Sadly instead of negotiating the CMP properly beforehand it was arrived at haphazardly. The result is that Mufti is playing to the local gallery to ensure that his party wins a majority in case the coalition breaks down and elections are held. BJP's best bet us to let him grandstand but ensure the coalition doesn't fail. Over a longer period hopefully better sense will prevail and PDP starts to push proper governance with the BJP.

                            Mr. Money Ahankar Liar, it's strange that you missed to include your boss Rajiv Gandhi in this list of those who were turned into martyrs, though he has openely supported the Sikh massacre by saying when a big tree falls, the earth shakes AND for his role in helping the CEO of the Union Carbide factory to run away from the country after the Bhopal Gas tragedy. Your party hasn't wasted any time in conferring him with Bharat Ratna the moment it got an opportunity to showcase your loyalty to the family.

                            This pseudo patriot should be stopped from mouthing or writing such drivel. Then he should be thrown out of the country for comparing Mahatma Gandhi and Bhagat Singh's incarceration with that of Afzal Guru and Masarat Alam. This man should be thrown out of the congress for anti party activities because his idiotic tirades against Modi have only resulted in enhancing Modi's popularity. So going by his own logic as stated in his blog today he should stop mentioning Modi's name and not allow his popularity to escalate. MSA think before you pen down anything. Because most of the time you end up defeating your own argument.
