Headline::::Really, RSS? Help to Lalit Modi is Nationalism?



DateTime::::2015-06-19T21:22:00+05:30




                                The noose is tightening and the myth is breaking. The Lalit Modi saga is getting bigger and murkier. The government, which a few weeks ago was looking impeccable on the issue of corruption, is now thoroughly exposed and it turns out that the Modi government is no different from the Manmohan Singh government. The only difference is that exposing the Manmohan Government took five years, the Modi government, only a year.
Rajasthan Chief Minister and powerful BJP leader Vasundhara Raje Scindia is in serious trouble. She is no ordinary leader. She is running a state with more than 3/4th majority and is a second term Chief Minister. She is also the daughter of Mrs Vijaya Raje Scindia, a member of the original triumvirate of the BJP along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani. Vasundhara Raje is the second-high profile leader after Sushma Swaraj who, as it turns outs, helped  Indian fugitive Lalit Modi, the original IPL commissioner and the czar of Indian cricket. There are tremendous similarities between both the leaders. Both went out of their way to help him. Sushma, being Foreign Minister, was not supposed to interact with a fugitive of the law, forget about bailing him out. Vasundhara was bolder. She wrote a secret letter to facilitate Lalit getting immigrant status in London, knowing well enough that she was on the wrong side of law and morality, and that is why she asked British Authorities to keep her name secret and not disclose it in public.
Both have enterprising Next-Gen kids. Lalit Modi, through his company, was so benevolent that he paid a premium price of Rs. 96,180 for shares worth Rs. 10 in a company owned by Vasundhara Raje's son. Sushma's daughter was a member of Modi's legal team who fought to get his passport restored. And once the Delhi High Court restored Modi's passport, the government chose not to appeal the verdict in the Supreme Court. Lalit Modi was also instrumental in getting Sushama Swaraj's nephew admitted in Sussex University when she was Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha.
Sushma Swaraj's husband has admitted that he helped Lalit Modi for the last 22 years in legal matters. The same Lalit Modi was known as "Mr Fixer" when Vasundhara was serving her first term as Chief Minister. In fact, Lalit Modi was so powerful that he was called the de facto Chief Minister, the real power behind the throne. So we have to accept the fact that Lalit Modi and the BJP go a long way back and both have been mutual beneficiaries.
Conflict of interest is the least of the crimes committed by these two very powerful women politicians of the BJP. In fact, this episode is an interesting study in the BJP/RSS understanding of nationalism and patriotism. The first day when the Sushma story broke, senior RSS leader Indresh Kumar said, "Sushma is a nationalist, patriot and she can't do any wrong." Party president Amit Shah said, "What is wrong if an Indian has helped another Indian? She did not let a Quattrocchi and Anderson run away." Quattrocchi was involved in the Bofors Scam and Anderson was the villain in the Bhopal tragedy. In the eyes of the BJP/RSS, nationalism can kindly be defined in the context of a foreigner and if an Indian breaks a law, cheats his own country, then it's not unpatriotic.
Sushma helped a man wanted in India to answer charges of  money laundering,  hawala transactions, match fixing and tax evasion. I want to ask the RSS if the same had been done by a Congress leader, would it have dubbed this an act of nationalism? Vasundhara's crime is much graver. She knew she was wrong, still she helped and wanted her help to Lalit Modi remain hidden from Indian authorities.
The RSS' selective definition of nationalism is laughable. On the 800th anniversary of the revolutionary Magna Carta, the true nationalistic obeisance to the motherland would be the strict adherence to the rule of law and if anybody is found violating it, they should be dealt with accordingly.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Fair points. Just don't get it why people are writing hate comments against him even though he seems to be making very valid points. But i guess thats where the party cult comes in. No matter how bad a political party's actions are you will always find people justifying their actions.

                            This character writes as if he were a little schoolboy given an essay exercise.  His writing consists in the main of short sentences setting out facts that are old and stale.  I wish NDTV would get rid of this useless character and bring in somebody who can write something interesting be it for or against the BJP/Congress/NCP or any party except AAP, the latter being far too small and confined to Delhi as to be of any consequence.

                            When Congress committed fraud, BJP leaders like Swamy went to court and proved wrongdoing. Why dont you do the same? Kejriwal has made a tremendous number of accusations but none had their day in court. Why? AAP is simply all talk. I am sorely disappointed by your mental acumen. Such a waste of the general public's well guided efforts to make a change. Just being an ex-IIT-ian or ex-journo doesnt make you always right. I work with a lot of IIT-ians and some of them thought technically brilliant at what they do have a very stupid perspective about life. Kejriwal is amongst them.He is simply all talk(and not a glib talker either) and zero action. Everything he is done so far is a disaster.

                            It's not worth commenting on a silly article but I have to say this to Ashutosh. Don't behave like you are any other party, the AAP used to stand for objectivity, neutrality. True the BJP has many corrupt elements, no doubt, but your party hasn't emerged smelling like roses either. So stop this dehati aurat act and at least put in place your lokpal, it will take only half the time and energy you put into whining.

                            Before commenting on RSS please take out some time (maybe even a day or two) and read about them and what they preach. There may be some negativeness but leave that aside and take in the positive thinking. What do they preach "love for Nation "and I do not see any thing wrong in that. all they say is that every one irrespective of whether he / her is Hindu , Muslim , christian or any other faith has a right to live here only if it is country first in his / her thoughts.
