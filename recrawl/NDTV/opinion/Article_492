Headline::::Why Kejriwal's Silence on AAP Crisis is Good



DateTime::::2015-04-07T16:08:00+05:30




                                
	(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)
	The Modi government has completed more than 300 days in office. The so-called honeymoon period should have been over by now, and tough questions should be asked about its non-performance and non-delivery, but political pundits are busier putting these questions to AAP. I don't know if it is because of genuine affection for AAP and hope from Arvind Kejriwal, or out of fear of the Modi government. I am not denying the fact that any government should be asked tough and tricky questions, be it led by Modi or Arvind. I am just asking for a level playing field. How the Modi government has performed will be judged by history, but before I move on, I can't resist saying that no other government has disappointed people more than the present one.
	Yes, it is true that its recent crisis has dented the image of the Aam Aadmi Party, and it will take some time to get over it. But it is equally true that it has not affected the functioning of the government in any way. This time, we were clear that  the government and party will have separate identities and will work in their own domains, and roles will not get mixed up. So when the crisis was on, the party took the field and defended and fought its internal rift, and the government did not get involved. No wonder many people were asking why the Chief Minister was not speaking, and why other members of the cabinet were quiet.
	The second regime of AAP presents a new formula for governance. Three things were done:1. Arvind does not hold charge of any ministry. It is an attempt to keep himself free, and work as a mentor of the government. And also to coordinate with different ministries and keep a keen eye on their functioning. And ministers should also know that the Big Boss is watching them.2. Then, 21 MLAs were assigned to assisting ministers and helping them get better inputs and solutions for governance in their respective departments. This is a unique experiment which will help the government to have a more broad-based understanding of the issues related to  ministries,  and also help grow a second rung of leadership.3. The Delhi Dialogue Commission has been created which will work as the think tank for the government. This commission has been asked to look for out-of-the-box solutions by  interacting with experts or through crowd-sourcing. Many innovative ideas were provided to the leadership by our volunteers and sympathizers -an innovation that has changed the landscape of Indian politics.
	I agree that there is a myth that those who lead movements are not equally competent administrators but this three-tier arrangement has augmented our resolve to present an alternate model of governance. And the initial 50 days proves this has allowed the government to  work in a crisis situation without being affected.
	While the Modi government has been struggling to fulfill its promises, AAP has already delivered on three key issues. It has been our commitment to make electricity available at half the price and water free of cost, and also curb corruption. The first two have already been done. Water supply has also improved tremendously in those areas where there is a serious water problem. The 'Tanker mafia' is on the way out in areas like Dwarka and Sangam Vihar  and the availability of tankers has improved, though a lot still has to be done.
	On the 5th of April, the Anti-Corruption Helpline (1031) was launched. It is AAP's promise to make Delhi the first corruption-free state in India. More than 10,000 calls can be entertained daily and the helpline will work 24/7 and 365 days. After processing each call, genuine complaints will be sent to the Anti Corruption Bureau. And let's not forget that the Modi government has withdrawn in July 2014 the directive issued nearly two decades ago, which enabled the  Anti Corruption Branch to proceed against central government employees too. This was an attempt to weaken the drive against corruption, but the AAP government has already passed a resolution in the assembly to restore that directive. Let's hope the central government also shows its resolve to fight corruption.
	Some fundamental attempts are being made to reform health services. Hospitals are known for fleecing the Aam Aadmi by charging exorbitant prices, and a standardization of prices is a need of the hour. The Government is working in this direction. Big hospitals are given land for peanuts in lieu of reserving 25% of beds for economically weaker sections of the society, but they don't do so, and these beds are sold to rich ones. The government is working to find a permanent solution to this issue.
	But let me assure you that this is just a beginning. AAP is committed to an alternate model of politics and governance which will set new benchmarks in Indian politics.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Following continuous rounds of accusations, discussions, deliberations, fist fighting, sloganeering and mud-slinging, Swami Shri Kejriwal aka Mufflerman led regiment has successfully kicked Yadav-Bhusan out of the AAP. A battalion, comprising highly trained sniffers, Ashutosh, Ashish Khetan and Ankit Lal, has been deployed on the border linking NDTV, Twitter and facebook, to foil any verbal attack on Swami Shri Kejriwal. Message is now very clear, like Shri Modijj, Rahulji, Ammaji, Dadaaji, Bhenji and Bhaiji, the AAP will now grow exponentially under Mufflerman's leadership. Swamiji has spread the words that anyone, who doesn't believe in Mufflerman's charisma, has no place in the AAP from now onwards.

                            Ashutosh Ashutosh! Son, you and logic are like 2 banks of the same river that can and never ever will meet. Tell me, what is the correlation between your article's title and the non-sense that follows? NOTHING. The title talks about the AAP crisis and the body about Modi. Going through your article is another nightmare. You claim to deliver your promise of curbing corruption, saying it's done, implying that Delhi is corruption-free now, so I am not sure what explains the 10000+ calls received by the anti-corruption helpline on the very first day of its launch! Moving on, you said 'How the Modi government has performed will be judged by history' yet in the very next statement you become a historian and judge it by saying 'no other government has disappointed people more than the present one'. No point asking but how was the UPA better than the current dispensation? Don't bother rattling your little brain over this question because you'll come up with some other non-sense and I'll again be picking holes in your arguments. As years pass, people usually mature and become wiser. In your case, it seems that you stopped growing mentally a couple of decades back. My heart goes out to your family who has to deal with you everyday. God bless them!

                            This Blind man, and all the other Blinds in pAAP can't see the improvement in the situation in the country. Yes we don't see concrete results yet, but directions have been set, ground prepared for a much faster growth. They don't listen to the right sounds, but listen only to the blabbermouths, which unfortunately the Government also has. To cover-up for their own failures, they are now launching an agitation against land aquisition bill. They want land from Central Government for making schools and hospitals (which will never be made), but don't want the center to aquire land. Such idiots and anti-national elements will only ruin the nation,

All states can't be Delhi. Even in matter only related to AAP, you try to bring Modi and central govt. You say "no other government has disappointed people more than the present one". WOW...so much for honesty.

                            It is strange someone has not taken any charge of work and has become mentor of government just after 1-2 years of experience. Irrespective of any amount of intelligence Ashutosh, we cannot leave sycophancy and will see all the dirty tricks or harakari of our leaders with sweet eyes....rationality take back seats and the person who wants to become rational is called "Gaddar". Do you all think we will ever be able to make this country a good place as claimed by AAP and that too when you have an insecured person as your top leader?

                            Notwithstanding the defence of the His Master's Voice, the fact remains that the public expected the party to be different from other political parties. The issues that came out in public speak that AAP may have compromised on its ethical values to win elections (possibly with good intent of providing better governance to the people; and not bother about the moral grounds). Even in this article, what is expected from AAP (different from other parties) is not "what others did not do; but what AAP has done". There should be no excuses for non-performance like some other state or centre not cooperating; or requiring additional budgetary support from centre etc (since these should have been considered before promising the people). The internal bickerings surely show that there are possibly some legislators (though elected) with background not as per original AAP ethics and whether AAP would bend backwards to support these people if there are any wrong-doings, just to remain in power. Anyway, it appears that it has become a one-man-power-centre now - for good or bad, only time will tell. One only hopes that the internal disputes would not dent the party's image as a different, honest, non-politicking party.

                            Dear Ashutosh,<br/>
Love the way you write. MBA student can learn a lot from your article, specially on subjects of how to please your BOSS.<br/>
Just quick comments on your article (hope you don't get me ban for raising my views).<br/><br/>
You stated why BJP/Modi is not questioned. Delhi Election it was BJP vs ALL. All parties were in support of AAP as they were against BJP. Modi is in focus even before he took oath.<br/><br/>
Good you cleared that Arvind is acting like Big Boss, rather than supportive colleague/mentor as we would have expected. Given Arvind is most popular in AAP party / government. So given the choice party will always select Arvind. Arvind played this game when he wanted Prasantji and Yogendraji out!<br/>
Note tomorrow if you don't follow his tail and he might stand up and ask to select between you and him, you should know where you stand. So please keep following tail properly. I can tell you you are doing great job until now.<br/><br/>
Modi has done work or not future will revel but the way he has taken his colleagues together (Rajnathji, Sushmaji, etc) is worth to be learn by all. Also give credit to their work time to time. Not one man show.<br/><br/>
You stated that Arvind kept himself away from crisis as he was part of government (CM). Just to remind you he is also AAP's National Conveyor. In future you might as well say, Arvind kept himself away from Govt Crisis as he is AAP Conveyor. Rather than facing the situation he choose to keep himself away (run away)!!!<br/><br/>
Cheap Electricity and Water given free by Govt is like kiske baap ki diwali. End of day it is public money, it could be used for other use too. AAP has conveyed in their Election Manifesto / speeches that this will be temp measure. Aim is to reduce by electric companies. We all are waiting for it to be seen!!. What happen to the last committee / CAG which was formed during 49 days of govt.<br/><br/>
BTW one ending note. Please change your DP. Please look into our eyes and have a smile. Don't shy away. :)
                         </div>

                            The ashutosh. What about jan lokpal bill? If ak is mentor why does he need the cm seat for that. Gandhi, Anna, even sonia gandhi did not have any executive position to mentor her followers. I believe ak is a very insecure man and needs the cm seat for that reason. The dictatorial attitude is also due to his insecurity. Shame on AK and his henchmen.

Trying to fool people showcasing himself as a humble, sincere and dedicated leader with lot of respect for fellow humans treating them as brother. However his real self came out in the stints, where he is abusing and bashing his very own former colleagues. He is the man who is crazy for power and really no ethics or any sort of ideology. His days a re counted...he has proved yet again, there cannot be clean politics in India...what a shame.

The promises that he has fulfilled are at the expense of tax payers and to show a pro poor image for votes. WHERE IS HE GOING TO CREATE WATER AND ELECTRICITY FROM AND NOW THAT HE IS DOLING FREEBIES WHO PAYS FOR IT ... NORMAL TAX PAYERS DONT GET ANY BENEFIT THEY PAY FOR AK'S PROMISES. Why is AK not taking up the power theft issue ? The generation companies are to be audited and nothing will come out of it , why is he shying away from taking on the power thieves.

                            The title reads "Why Kejriwals silence on AAP crisis is good" - but Ashutosh has gone on to write about governance and not a word on AAP crisis. The supporters of AAP was waiting for solid answers. Don't try to sweep things under the carpet talking about governance. Governance is ofcourse important - but the AAP issues also need addressing. Getting people who question you out of the way is not the way to fix them.  <br/>
AAP has become KAAP - Kejriwwals AAP and functions like KHAP.<br/>
AAP is also HAP - Hamara Aadmi Party

                            Ashutosh, you are from journalism background. Don't you feel shame to write all these praises about your team leader who is just hiding his face post AAP turbulence? You are defending him just like a man protects his helpless child. Its good show from your end but extremely poor outcome from the party leader. <br/><br/>
Trust me, it will do more good if you are elected as Party chief than AK. I am a supporter of some of the members of AAP which includes you as well but not the leader AK. Try it, I assure you, your party will do more good with you as the Chief than AK. <br/><br/>
Finally, stop blaming the present central Govt before writing your views. Either you are too poor wtith current affairs or you are totally unaware of the recent developments. Get updated!

How can the party and government have separate identities when it is the same person heading both?<br/>
What is the manpower strength of the anti-corruption call centre that receives and processes the calls. How will the call centre identify what is a genuine case of corruption and what is not?<br/>
Call centre in itself means nothing to Aam aadmi. Unless you have empowered the system with adequate resources including manpower, this will be seen as lip service.

                            That a third rate former journalist and now a full time sycophant to Kejriwal should compare the AAP Government in Delhi to the national Government led by Modi says a lot for Ashutosh!.  Kejriwal has always been, is and will always be a feckless, weak and stupid agitator moving from one job to another, from one dharna to another and from one conspiracy to another.  This is strictly a one term AAP Government; when the slum dwellers stop getting electricity and water via subsidy because subsidy is a finite resource, they will boot Kejriwal out.  No problem for him.  he will have lived the life of Riley for 5 years and will infiltrate the next movement.

                            "Arvind does not hold charge of any ministry. It is an attempt to keep himself free, and work as a mentor of the government. And also to coordinate with different ministries and keep a keen eye on their functioning."  Mr. Ashuthosh, we understand this pretty well. Even if he is incharge of any portfolio, what can he do? All that he knows is dharna, snap strikes, seek sympathy, spread lies (like he blatantly did regarding poaching of MLAs while it was he himself who was poaching MLAs from other parties), sit in protest in front of the governor's residence every day for the next 5 years  without even knowing where the Delhi secretariat is. Where is the will to govern? You mean to say the deputy CM and other ministers in the AAP will work? note that if these ministers do not join kejriwal on hartals, bandhs, morchas, hunger strikes, etc., they will no longer remain ministers at the end of the day. However, you can keep all the virtues of your leader and your party in a locker since no one, not even your own volunteers and donors, are interested in knowing them (they all know the truth now), so please see that your position in the party is stabilized since you would be rejected by any prospective employer in India for all the muck you, your colleagues and your leader have created over the last few fortnights.....Lead a life, ashuthosh.....Life is unforgiving!

Word play can not fool common man and sooner than later, you will be held accountable. Feeling very sorry about what is happening in AAP. And above all, I despise this Ashutosh. AAP never needed Ashutosh and such dirty minds.

                            Of course it is good - Chamchas have a field day and Kejri watches the fun knowing fully well that victory will be his - no matter what the chamchas say or do.<br/><br/>
The public expected MORE from Mr. Kejriwal

                            "insaan kaa insaan se ho bhaai-chaaraa" meant "(ek) insaan (AK) kaa (kuchh) insaan se ho bhaai-chaaraa".

                            Those controlling the AAP presently, assume they have some exclusive ownership of the party. Sadly they have removed almost half of the stalwarts who helped build the party to what it is. If this trend continues only the generals will remain and the foot soldiers will be missing.

Is it Duryodhan and four cronies of (Neo)Mahabharat.

                            It is not the fact of  expulsion of two eminent colleagues, it is the manner in which they were expelled which raised fundamental question as to whether AAP's present leader ship (AK et al) betrayed the expectations of people.<br/><br/>
People supported AAP  because it appeared clean, a whiff of fresh air , far from the maddening ways  of the existing political parties. <br/>
But the manner the present leadership behaved, took recourse to hooliganism to browbeat opponents, used bargaining to get to power ,top leader used absolutely third rate language to criticise their elders in the party , insulted and ignored their internal Lokpal who was once the raison d'etre of the party.<br/>
The party leadership appears to be extremely keen to hold on to power , means notwithstanding. It beats any   imagination as to  how you can give a clean government if you have used unfair means to attain power. You  yourselves have used hooliganism , you'll find it difficult to stop hooliganism of others and the like.<br/>
Therefore , any promise by AAP leadership  appears 'promise' only with no reasonable hope for turning it into reality.<br/>
In all probability, the present leadership will go the AGP way which also came to power with high hope and failed in no time under the weight of its internal squabble and lack of ethics.

                            Compare apples with apples, not apples with oranges. State and central governments can't be compared because their sphere of influence are different.<br/>
Still, if as an AAP apologist you want to, here is my reply:<br/>
Modi has promised to solve much more complicated problems like industrialization and elimination of poverty and terrorism. Comparable complexity of problem is the promise of a Jan Lok Pal in Delhi, the only promise I can compare of.<br/>
---<br/>
Complexity comparable to AK's achievements (and there are achievements by AK) has been achieved by Modi on numerous points:<br/>
Laws about land, labor, forex handling - done. One rank, one pension - done. Commodity dabba trading under SEBI's observation (and saving 10,000 cr Rs/day rolling in black money) - done. Independence of RBI in terms of inflation control - done. Free and fair elections in J&amp;K - done.<br/>
The list is very long. It is easy to ignore if you want to.

                            I would like to ask a question from the aaptards.<br/>
When he became the CM of Delhi for the first time, he quits for janlokpal and said that he has no greed of power and he wants to work for Delhi only and his resignation proves that too but a new CM of 49 days with hardly any political experience of running a half state, Why he took part in the Loksabha elections for the post of PM. No Apptard has been able to answer me that question.<br/>
Now he has fooled the people again, because Delhi is city of fools who just want everything in free and believes in "Short term profit and long term loss" policies and this huge subsidy will prove a disaster to everyone because all development work will get stop and will go waste to fulfill the promises made by him. Instead of spending money on creating better infrastructure, if will go on subsidy but subsidy is short term solution. How can you provide something free when don't have it?

                            Ashutosh says "While the Modi government has been struggling to fulfill its promises, AAP has already delivered on three key issues". Lets not forget that Mr.Modi has to look after the whole country, not just a municipality.

                            AAP's populist policy of reducing power &amp; water tariffs devalues these scarce commodities and will soon lead to water &amp; power shortages in Delhi.  True governance requires that the true cost of valuable resources are acknowledged and appropriately priced, to encourage conservation and thrifty use, and also enable future investment in developing new resources.<br/><br/>
Arvind Kejriwal may be well meaning, but his policies are foolish.
