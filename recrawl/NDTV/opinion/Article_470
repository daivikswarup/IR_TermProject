Headline::::Why I Attended Pak Day Reception



DateTime::::2015-03-24T15:09:00+05:30




                                
	(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha)
	I was at Pakistan's National Day reception last night, as I usually am. Unfortunately, I missed out on the kebabs and other goodies as I was able to spend only about 15 minutes there; the Hon'ble Vice President had invited me about the same time to an official banquet in honour of his Cuban counterpart. But I went nevertheless to Pakistan House because I believe Pakistan is the most important country on our foreign policy agenda.
	I am a regular at Pakistan National Day receptions (so much so that I was once asked to be the Government of India's official representative, predecessor to General VK Singh). This is partly nostalgia. I spent three of the most fruitful and enjoyable years of my life as India's first-ever Consul General in Karachi (Dec 1978- Jan 82), and made so many friends there that 25 years after I returned, no less than 46 of them turned up for my daughter's wedding. They are a warm, friendly, hospitable people and I never cease to be amazed at our inability to turn that affection to political advantage. I also believe that there are at least three major factors that make it imperative for us to seize opportunity by the forelock.
	First, the Partition generation in Pakistan, those who were Indians for much of their lives before they became Pakistanis, has virtually phased out. That was the generation that could not but define their own identity in terms of NOT being Indian: "I am a Pakistani because I am not an Indian". The present generations of Pakistanis are Pakistanis - because they are Pakistanis! They were born there, grew up there, have always been Pakistanis and are quite comfortable with their Pakistani passports.
	Second, their domestic problems, particularly homegrown sectarianism and terrorism, are so overwhelming that instead of hostility to India being the centerpiece of their national existence, as it was in the immediate aftermath of Partition, India has been so far pushed out of their national consciousness, that in the last two elections, neither India nor even Kashmir figured in any of the principal parties' campaigns.
	Third, while hostility against India and Hindus is a running theme in the propaganda of the Islamist extremists, these extremists have so lost sympathy in Pakistan at large that in election after election, their position on the margins is confirmed. Our hostility only helps those in Pakistan who wish to play up that hostility. The mainstream response is to work, if at all possible, towards a viable relationship with India. Working out that viability requires, of course, dialogue - dialogue that, to be eventually fruitful, has to be "uninterrupted and uninterruptible". Yet, we have been shooting ourselves in the foot by repeatedly breaking off the dialogue, converting the relationship into a game of snakes and ladders where we progress significantly up the ladders of mutual cooperation only to let the snakes swallow us up and take us back to the beginning.
	The reply I have received to a Question I posed in the just-concluded first half of Parliament's budget session makes the point succinctly: that when we engage diplomatically, cease-fire violations virtually cease, while when we disengage, cease-fire violations increase exponentially. The figures I have been officially supplied show that in the years 2004, '05 and '06, when Dr. Manmohan Singh's special envoy, Ambassador Satinder Lambah, was consistently on the back-channel with his Pakistani interlocutor, Ambassador Tariq Aziz, cease-fire violations were just 1, 6 and 3 respectively. As, however, in 2007, when the dialogue seized up and eventually broke down, ceasefire violations rose to 21, shot up to 80, then 93 in 2012, and peaked in 2013 at 199. 2014 recorded a small decline to 153. There are approximately 150-200 times more violations when war clouds are gathering than when peace is on the horizon.
	Does that not show that we have got cause and effect wrong when we insist that cease-fire violations must end for talks to begin? Past experience shows that the best way to end cease-fire violations is for us to talk to each other, rather than at each other.
	Among my fellow-guests at the Pakistan reception were, I understand, Mirwaiz Farooq and a team of Hurriyat leaders. I would have liked to meet them, as I usually do at Pakistan National Day receptions. This time I was denied the pleasure for I was at the reception for far too short a time to really walk around. But on previous occasions, the Hurriyat have always greeted me fondly and invited me to Kashmir (an invitation that has, alas, never been followed up!) I greet them not because I agree with them, but because they are fellow human beings, fellow Indians (even if they do not always so regard themselves), and people we have to persuade to at least edge themselves towards us if we want not only Kashmir but also Kashmiris.
	That is why Dr. Manmohan Singh's interlocutors - Dileep Padgaonkar, Radha Kumar and MM Ansari - made a point of meeting them and soliciting their views. That there was so little follow up on the interlocutors' report is a tragedy, but one that will only be compounded if the government in Delhi tries to shut them out. Fortunately, J&K Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has a better grasp of ground realities in the Valley than his partners in government.
	Of course, as a fellow Indian, it is my right (and duty) to meet the Hurriyat if I can. But do the Pakistanis have a locus standi? It was Atal Behari Vajpayee, none other, who answered that one when he allowed (encouraged?) Pervez Musharraf to meet with the Hurriyat at the time of the Agra summit. Until August last year, it had become standard practice for the Hurriyat to not only be invited to the Pakistan National Day reception, but also to interact with Pakistani dignitaries visiting India. Indeed, the government itself facilitated a visit to Pakistan by the Hurriyat leadership. It has done us no harm -Â  and done the Pakistanis precious little good.
	Stupidly, Modi made a proposed routine encounter between the Hurriyat and the Pakistan High Commissioner, on the eve of the Indian Foreign Secretary's visit to Pakistan, the casus belli to kill that initiative at resuming the Indo-Pak dialogue. He has since been impaled on the horns of the dilemma that he has needlessly created for himself - To Talk or NOT to Talk? That is the question!
	The process of climbing off the high horse has begun. Not only has the new Foreign Secretary been to Islamabad, Delhi is now beginning to walk the talk on dialogue. Instead of sending so graceless a representative, Modi should have ensured that we were more decently represented.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            I wish he had stayed long enough to eat the Kebabs Nihari and Biryani; then he might have had a reason enough to write how tasty they were. Which might have had some literary value probably. After all, he made into the Rajya Sabha as a Nominated M.P. as an alleged writer of Literature.

                            I think Mani has changed his writing strategy. He has realized that people go straight to the comments section without reading his opinions. Hence in an attempt to make audience read his opinion, he writes about his own personal experiences in the first few paragraphs of his opinion, does not criticize PM Modi and towards the end goes back to writing nonsense. I wonder why he was unable to use his personal relationship with his 40 odd Pakistani friends who attended his daughter's wedding to influence Pakistan's foreign policy towards India. I also wonder why Mani, as a diplomat or as a member of Congress Party, was unable to influence successive Congress led governments who have governed us for 60 years to continue talking to Pakistan and not call off the peace process every now and then. Instead of providing an objective assessment of the situation, his only objective seems to denigrate PM Modi. What a disgrace!

                            I have to concede: good points by Mani Kaka, notwithstanding the routine Modi bashing towards the end of the article.  Indian chest thumping against a weaker adversary like Pakistan serves no purpose. Similarly, the Pakistani habit of comparing almost everything in their spectrum through an Indian lens is a fruitless exercise.<br/>
Let's start with increased people to people contacts and expand from there.

But we as a nation cutting through all our diversity will not bow down to this kind of warfare that kills our young soldiers. Go and give this sermon in one of those martyred Jawans house or the policemen who died in 26/11 and see what they do to you.  It is your kind of soft bodied, bottom scavenging diplomacy that has taken India to where it is today. Ashamed of you.

                            There is no doubt the NDA govt has got itself totally knotted up on the Pak Hurriyat engagement but that is the nature of the problem as far as Indo Pak relations are concerned. Even engagements as MSA is suggesting are generally pointless exercises whenever a civilian govt is in power in Pakistan because the army there would do all it can to undo the sincere effort, recent history is testimony to this fact.

                            Full of meaningless verbiage falsehoods and non sequiturs!This is typical of him <br/>
He talks of less ceasefire violation in 2007 and only21 in 2008<br/>
But conveniently ignores Mumbai attack Kasav confessed upon interrogation that the attacks were conducted with the support of Pakistan Government's intelligence agency ISI.The attacks, which drew widespread global condemnation, began on Wednesday, 26 November and lasted until Saturday, 29 November 2008, killing 164 people and wounding at least 308.<br/>
Was this culmination of Congress's diplomacy of which he was self appointed architect ?Ceasefire violations cannot be a measure of success-a fire is met with greater fire.But attack on commercial hub was intolerable.This was attaching India'vitals.Countries like Pakistan respect power otherwise they call Manmohan Singh as dehati aurat.My God what a relief that Mani Shankar Aiyar is not a Minister and his Party is not even India's Opposition!

a) Pakistanis are schizophrenic when it comes to India; A part of them loves everything about India, and another part hates equally<br/><br/>
b) The state of Pakistan will never give up its plans to send terrorists to Kashmir to destabilize India, because they are obsessed with Kashmir. <br/><br/>
c) Their minds are stuck in the so called two nation theory and so called Ideology of Pakistan. So, any dialogue with them is like going in circles.<br/><br/>
Only way to deal with Pakistan is never to drop your guard and keep growing stronger economically, so that Pakistan can not win an arms race with India. In fact drive them to bankruptcy through arms race (like the USA did to the Soviets)

                            Dear Mani Shankar Aiyar, You can take a horse to the water but can't force it to drink. Your Pakistani horsre doesn't want to drink your Life-Giving Water fearing it may cure its illness(you mention about). Interestingly, why don't you have so much care for Israel? - to help Israel cure its illness by strengthening our people to people relations with it?<br/>
Lastly India should no longer frame its foreign policy w.r.t fear of Pakistan's aggression on LOC or annoying China/Arab.

                            MSA is a self proclaimed paragon of virtue. He is so enamoured of the Pakistanis that he prefers hating the Indians in the govt because they do not belong to the congress. He is God's gift to human race especially Indians - again as per his own assumption. His height of intelligence goes to the extent of making him write that India does not figure anywhere in Pakistani mindset. He also attends the Pakistan Day celebrations every year as he did this year but he is sorry that he missed the kebabs - very sorry MSA. A very sad day indeed for you. I am sure if you call up Pervez Musharraf or Kayani or Hafiz Saeed or Lakhvi, they will ensure that kebabs are sent to your residence. MSA, don't you realize that in every article that you write you end up countering your own argument ? You say that border violations go down when dialogue is in progress but escalate when no dialogues are on - doesn't your superior intelligence tell you that the Pakistanis are taking care that their diplomats in India come back home safely. That it would be very difficult for the Pakistanis to heap baseless allegations on us when border violations or cross- border firing is on. And also that it is an implicit threat that if you do not turn the way we want you to turn then we shall continue killing your army personnel as well as civilians. MSA's superior intelligence FORCES him to call Modi 'STUPID'. Pray, MSA what will your call RG who talks about 2 children out of a total of 1 ? What will you call RG who says 'balatkaar kiya' instead of 'atyachar kiya' ? What will you call RG who is up on the stage during election rally and canvassing for congress  but does not know the name of the candidate ? What will you call Robert Vadra who called our country a 'banana' republic when the congress was in power ? MSA, get off your high horse and try to read the public mood; try and understand and formulate the ways to help your party get out of the morass into which it is currently languishing; although difficult for you, try to respect people even those other than yourself, your fast disappearing party members, your floundering party president and the absconding RG.

                            Dear Mr. Aiyar, <br/><br/>
You make some good points (specially about the new pakistan generation) but you miss out on a key variable - which is terrorism. The reason why we stopped talking wasn't because of cross border firing but terrorism, and specifically Mumbai attack in 2008. I think if you were to look for a "cause and effect" relationship, you will find that the terrorist activities have increased when we have been talking to them. <br/>
In fact the terrorist attacks were at its peak during the backchannel talks you refer to, and culminated into Mumbai attacks, after which your own government stopped talks. And since then there haven't been major bombings/terrorist attacks in India apart from Kashmir. I don't see why there is any imperative need for talking with Pakistan till the time they don't mend their ways. The Indian public doesn't want any more losses to sustain what is only a farce from the Pakistan establishment.

                            Mani Shankar Aiyar is Pakistani. he was born in Pakistan. Jinnah had declared his intention to create Secular Pakistan. Aiyar is staunch secularist. So there was no reason for him to leave Pakistan. So he an economic refugee like Bangladeshis in India. It is disgusting to see refugee like Aiyar removing Plaque of Son of soil like Savarkar in Port Blair.

                            A well written article but Mani Shankar places all the fault with India especially PM Modi.The villain at the heart of the Indo Pak problem are the Pak army and the unsuccessful barrister and third grade cambridge graduate who congealed the enterprise and initiaive of Indian economy by miring India in the soviet style of central planning.<br/>
It is clear to observe tht Modi is desperate to improve and normalise relationships with usa and pakistan,both of which fractured under the incompetent and over prone and complict  Man mohan singh who overlooked the corruption scams under his watch.<br/>
Pakistan should grasp this opportunity to normalise with India by resisting their army's urges to bleed Kashmir with a thousand cuts.<br/>
Whether Mr Aiyer went to the see Mr Ansarior the Pak HC,it matters little.So long his 46 Pak friends attend his parties,he's happy to forfeit anything leave alone Kashmir.

                            By reading your article it seems that india Pakistan problem should have been solved by now. Because you were with Congress government for 2 terms before modi government came... But the reality is that the problem is not solved a bit even with people such a you in the government... I liked your eatlier article  but now it seems too unrealistic to be true... I think the problem is much more complicated that how you are presenting... If you were not able to relieve the tensions between the two nations when you got the chance it's better to observe and keep your mouth shut... We are not interested in knowing how many Pakistanis came to your daughters wedding or how popular you are in Pakistan... This information is useless for us... When you have failed its better to accept your faults (which you rarely do)...

                            Foreign policy is not mere globetrotting and PR propaganda - which has been the hallmark of the current PM's style of handling foreign relations...there are deeper aspects to the job and it is a very big challenge to handle relations with difficult neighbours more than rhetorical satirism and nationalistic sloganism...that's the message Mani Shankar Aiyer is conveying !!

                            I found it amusing at the start of one of your paragraphs, the words  "Stupidly, Modi" next to each other.ð

                            Mr. Main Shankar Iyer, In your write up you have said that when the talks fail there is cease fire violations. It only means that Pakistan wants only its way not any other way. Such a neighbor cannot be a good neighbor. People of pakistan may be nice as you put it and we may not have any problem with it. But the government is not representing that view. The military is not maintaining this view. It is well know that Military over throws the government there. So the government though elected by people will have to listen to the military. You mean to say that there is no funding for the acts of terror in India at all!!!! Talks have been happening a lot with Pakistan. But we have to talk to them in equal terms not listen to them and have kababs!!!!

                            The so called "Warm, friendly and hospitable people" of Pakistan were dealing with the congress party at the helm of Indian government for most of our history - barring a few non-congress governments. Mani himself was part of some of these government. Now Mani must answer WHY HIM &amp; HIS GOVERNMENT DID NOT CONVERT THE WARMTH OF PAKIS INTO POLITICAL ADVANTAGE FOR INDIA ????? We can broadly come to only one conclusion - The pakis are not as "good" as Mani says and Modi government is not as bad as is made out to be. Mani lays the blame at the door step of 10 month old Modi government and excludes 60 years of "paki friendly" congress governments. MANI MUST GET HIS HEAD EXAMINED BEFORE GOING AHEAD WITH MORE SUCH STUPID WRITINGS.

                            Who cares for your opinion? Don't we know why you attended? it was because you have nothing else to do these days other than Modi-bashing and blabbering on economy. But I wish you stayed back in Pakistan to let us breathe some fresh air here in India, you loser.

                            The November 2003 ceasefire on the LoC and the subsequent four years of backchannel negotiations did produce a pronounced lull along the LoC; but what broke the negotiations was not anything that India did, but rather Musharraf v. Chief Justice of Pakistan.  It is when the political situation is unsettled in Pakistan; as it was after 2007, that we get attacks like Mumbai 26/11; and LoC ceasefire violations.  It is when the political situation stabilizes in Pakistan that the LoC can also calm down. It is coincidental that it is during periods of political stability in Pakistan that India-Pakistan negotiations can occur.  I think Mani Shankar Aiyyar has confused cause and effect; it is when Pakistan is politically unsettled that its aggression against India increases, it is when Pakistan is politically relatively stable that negotiations with India are possible, and the LoC is quiet.

                            Nice to know that somebody in India is talking sense and knows how to conduct diplomatic relations. Mr. Aiyar's contribution may help in restoring diplomatic disaster created by the tweets of Gen. V K Singh, who should have known better than behaving like a Subedar or Sargent in army parade ground. Whatever anybody's views about certain elements in Pakistan, nothing could possibly be gained by being verbally nasty on their important national day.
