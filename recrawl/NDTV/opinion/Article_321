Headline::::What These Results Mean for Modi and BJP 



DateTime::::2014-12-23T19:13:00+05:30



(Siddharth Varadarajan is a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Public Affairs and Critical Theory, Shiv Nadar University)Mission 44 was always going to be a tough ask, a target Narendra Modi set deliberately high for the BJP in Jammu and Kashmir because he needed to prove his model of 'Development with Hindutva characteristics' had takers in India's only Muslim-majority state. In the event, the party did much better than it has ever done before but mainly because it won virtually every pocket where Hindu voters are in a plurality. While all of its 25 seats come from the Jammu region, the BJP lost its deposit across Kashmir and its feisty but ultimately much-hyped candidate from Amirakadal in Srinagar, Heena Shafi Bhat, placed a distant third.On a plain reading of the numbers, then, the BJP's 'Mission' has been a failure but it has definitely left its imprint on the politics of the state. Ms Bhat and a host of other BJP candidates in constituencies like Hazratbal and Shopian may have lost their deposits, but they managed to outpoll the Congress party, establishing a small presence in the Valley for the first time. Moreover, the party's impressive score in Jammu makes it a serious contender for power as an ally of either the Peoples' Democratic Party (PDP) or the National Conference, especially if Modi is able to leverage the promise of New Delhi's backing for any coalition government that has his blessing.Much will depend on how the power games play out over the next 48 hours as key players in what is obviously a hung assembly weigh their options. For the BJP, the result presents an opportunity for it to broadbase its approach to the state's problems and act not just as the representatives of (Hindu) voters in Jammu. This would mean shedding the more contentious parts of its programme, such as advocating the repeal of Article 370 of the Constitution granting special status to J&K, not to speak of the wider Hindutva agenda that continues to exert a baneful influence over the party and its government.Confounding the pre-poll surveys, Omar Abdullah and the National Conference have survived to fight another day. The temptations of office as an alliance partner of the BJP might seem irresistible to it and to the PDP, which improved its tally on an anti-incumbency wave. However, both parties will need to overcome misgivings about the impact such a tie-up would have on their (Muslim) voters who are troubled by the chauvinism of the Hindutva brigade. On paper, the PDP and the Congress have the numbers to form a government provided they can rope in some of the smaller parties and independents. PDP leader Mufti Mohammed Sayeed may be most comfortable with this arrangement, but it will take all his skill as a politician to ensure the Modi government at the Centre does not turn hostile as a result.If Kashmir was a bridge too far and the BJP knew it, the party's failure to win a convincing majority in Jharkhand ought to trigger concern about fighting election campaigns around the personality of Narendra Modi when the appeal of his cult is clearly beginning to wane.So confident of the Modi wave was the BJP that a section of its state leadership, notably Raghubar Das, wanted the party to fight all 81 seats on its own and promise the electorate a majority government that would not be dependent on coalition partners. After all, the party had won as many as 57 Vidhan Sabha segments in the 2014 general election. However, BJP president Amit Shah and former Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Munda knew better, and tied up with the All Jharkhand Students Union. As it turns out, it is only with the AJSU's 4 seats that the BJP, which is leading in 38 seats, will be in a position to form the next government in the state. So what are the national-level takeaways from the election results in Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir?First, if the Congress alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal and Janata Dal (United) in Jharkhand came a cropper, the resurgence of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha - with whom the Congress ran a coalition government in Ranchi - suggests the BJP remains vulnerable to intelligent seat-sharing arrangements. In Kashmir too, a deal between the Congress and National Conference - which ran a coalition for six years - would have definitely altered the electoral picture in the state.Second, regardless of the outcome, the emergence of robust contestation in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir has created an opportunity for people - particularly in the Valley - to think afresh about elections as a form of political participation. Already, the Peoples' Conference of the former separatist leader Sajjad Lone has won two seats. Perhaps the months and years ahead will see new parties and politicians emerging in the state. Third, the BJP needs to make a fundamental choice about what kind of party it wants to be, and it is Narendra Modi who really has to take a call on this. The party's sweep in Jammu may encourage Hindutva hotheads to believe polarization is a good thing. However, its failure to make much of a dent in the Valley - whose people are thirsting for "development, "good governance" and all the other things Modi says he is interested in - shows the downside to the chauvinist politics that has been on display across India the past few months.Â  Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Come on Sidharth- you just don't seem to learn! Don't know how guys like him are asked to write a column despite his so apparant Anti BJP bias! Even after all the support from Media (filled with Guys like Sidharth V) the Modi magic just does not seem to wane - to the utter disappointment of these guys. Do we see a similar patter as we saw with MOdi in GUjarat- never once did these guys think Modi did anything right in that state but obviously the people on the ground thought otherwise and have been voting him back to power since 15 years- despite of so Anti Modi media!

                            Judging by the speed with which, these anti-Modi and anti-BJP writers come out with blog after every election results to prove that there is no Modi wave. I can only pity on them, as they all are suffering from inferiority complex resulted from rise of Modi. But deep down in the heart they know that their time is over and can not stop Modi, no matter how hard they try.

                            No Surprise this from the franchise.What is bothering though is the authors affiliation to the Shiv Nadar University.Numbers clearly speak Mr Sidhdharth and it is a terrible error in judgement on your part to think that only Hindus voted for BJP.Your writing is loaded with the misplaced Notion that BJP is harmful for the minorities in India. You perpetuate the cause the ideology of congress and you sound like a congress spokesperson. Please be rational and try to present an unbiased view of the situation. You may be helping the congress cause but you do no justice to the position you hold at the shiv nadar university.

                            Looks the author is projecting the winner of the election as loser. This is a strange analysis. He talks of Hinduvta in Jammu and probably he is unaware that a muslim candicate has won on BJP ticket from Jammu. It is nothing more than a blatant attempt to hide one's frustration and the fear of being faded into oblivion.

                            Dear Siddharth, BJP gained 14 seats in J&amp;K and 19 seats in Jharkhand! What else do you expect? Instead of writing against Modi and trying your best to throw anti Indian sentiment and trying to be non Indian as much as possible, kindly suggest what is the way for India to move ahead! Do you have a solution for that? Why beat down somebody who wants bring in a change? Cannot figure out which camp you belong to! Whichever camp it maybe, the camp surely is anti Indian! God save Shiv Nadar University and its students!

                            Amazing how Modi does not talk Hindu-Muslim, but all the so-called seculars are the ones breaking into communal language &amp; interpretation. If Modi did not win Muslim votes, then Muslims are not 'secular' as they vote only for Muslims. So the problem is perhaps with Muslims and NOT Modi. Cheers.

                            Siddarth is doing Manishshankar Ayyar! Its absurd to say that BJP has not won in Jarkhand. How can writer like Siddharth ignore the aspirations of Jarkhand who gave majority to BJP? Mr. Siddarath has failed to understand the mood of nation and sticking to age old corrupt, secular front. His views on BJP is clearly biased. What can be said on opposing BJP tooth nell. These writer's hyper anti Modi and BJP made them to ignore country, people and development. Its foolish to think that corrupt Congress, RJD, TMC  or communal SP and opportunistic  Nitish do well for poor. Ignorant of people leads to end of one side journalism.

It is odd that the liberal SICKULAR media wants muslim obscurantist demands respected at all costs. <br/><br/>
If a certain section of muslim electorate cannot see the truth then so be it. <br/><br/>
THrough out 2000 year history hindu leaders never forced muslims to convert to hindus. Wheras majority of muslim leadership forced hindus to convert. <br/><br/>
It continues to this day. <br/><br/>
Hindu india allows muslim to follow their faith. <br/><br/>
But Muslim pakistan and bangladesh have pretty much wiped out their minorities. <br/><br/>

                            Absurdly comical Op-Ed lecturing Modi about his "choices" - as if he needs some upstart opinion on how to conduct "politics". The Kashmir valley has been hostile to Hindus since the 1970s - name a SINGLE MLA from the valley in the last 30 years ? The J&amp;K Assembly dominated by Kashmiri Muslims has skewed the electoral districts to always retain the majority with Kashmir but also subvert the Buddhists in Ladhak and the Sikhs and Hindus in Jammu where-ever they can. In this context, where deeply Islamofascist forces in the Kashmir valley continue to "wage war" against India - a pro-Hindu, pro-nationalist party has come out on top to challenge the Islamic hegemony. This was done not by wooing the Hindu voter but by offering development. The "thirst" of the Kashmiri for development is also quenched in the narrow well of zelotry- the BJP had no illusions about this..only this journalist does.

It is because of left wing bias of people and writers and editors like you that I stopped reading hindu. <br/>
Because you guys dont really care for india or hindus . Hindus will always respect any religion. But can you guarantee the same by ulema? or the archbishiop? <br/><br/>

                            Mr Varadrajan,is actually removed so far from reality....no wonder Congress by listening to these people is going from bad to worse.Mr Modi is actually a metaphor in mindset of Indians as harbinger of change and governance.Today atleast we feel in India,that there is some governance....at least someone somewhere is taking note...whether it is a robbery attempt or a rape attempt or worse still  any Anti-Human rant in Twitter etc.<br/>
Today USA respects us,we managed to thwart China even though a small bit but nevertheless change in World regarding India's image is there for everyone to see.Congress by giving out doles to "PSEUDO-INTELLECTUALS" in NIA and other freebies ensured their support in Social/Print Media.Lets forgive and forget all of them.

                            Modiji tried his best in Kashmir and he performed much better than anticipated.  We all know very well that Muslims will not vote for BJP, and that too in Kashmir.  Varadarajan seems to be happy he got a chance to bash BJP and is giggling a lot.  He had not giggled since the Parliamentary election results got out in May.  I am glad he got a chance to giggle.  May be when UPA Govt. comes back to power (if ever they come to power) Varadarajan will get a Padmashree award for journalism.

                            This is a pure inferiority complex and a self blinding - denial mode ! Writers like this S. Varadarajan and so called commentators like Ketkar and their ilk are "converted" stooges of the British Raj. They never seem to find anything good about an indigenous Indian !  They live in a different virtual world which they believe only they have a "royal" right to interpret regardless of the actual reality !<br/><br/>
The blind-folded leading the stupid ! So be it !<br/>
They will never realise that India has changed long ago !

                            These anti-Modi baiters have become frustrated. It's pathetic how much in denial they are. Winning an outright majority in Jharkhand is not a sign of waning Modi wave but ascending, and it will continue.

                            For people like Varadarajan, no matter what BJP does, it will always remain communal. Their definition of secularism is not the separation of state and religion; their definition of secularism is special privileges for Muslims and Christians and utter contempt of anyone who talks about the equal rights (not the privileges) of Hindus. So unless you start appeasing these two minority communities, you cannot be considered secular.

                            Most of the political leaders including the so called free press do not see the gradual enhancement of BJP strength all over India some where very fast and some where slow because of the regional compulsions . One things is sure the country has a strong alternative now to congress ... Country has a democratic party with strong organization strength and decisive and educated leadership compared to a congress party run by an Italian Madam and supported by a handful of sycophants who decided to keep their mouth shut and who were just looting the country at the behest of the Italian Madam ... All elections during the year 2014 for all opposition leaders and media nuts were just to compare what Modiji did whether there is his magic instead of suggesting what happened to congress , what happened to Marxists or what happened to Lallus and Yadavs ...Once BJP finishes the task of 2014 winning maximum elections , now it will start its economic agenda and the world is waiting for it ... India becoming superpower whether it includes an element of nationalistic fervour or not , whether it amounts to little amount of Hindutuva too

                            If PDP cannot form a stable government without BJP, President's rule means BJP rule. I think BJP not winning the Muslim vote in Kashmir is a good thing. The rest of India's Hindus will now support BJP and not fear it becoming a Muslim supporter.<br/><br/>
If PDP and BJP come to gather to form government, at the next election, they can split the seats and wipe out NC and Congress. Wiping any remnants of Congress and Abdullah is a huge advancement for the BJP.
