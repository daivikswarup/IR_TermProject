Headline::::A JNU Professor Says Defenceless Students Targeted



DateTime::::2016-02-14T19:36:00+05:30




                                The developments over the last few days with regard to JNU are disturbing for more than one reason.
Firstly, students have been held guilty on the draconian charge of sedition on the basis of video clippings which have not been verified for authenticity, nor have all the people who were present in the objectionable event been identified. The decision to arrest the student union president, Kanhaiya Kumar, has not been reached through proper procedure and has in fact been very hasty. What is the reason for whipping up emotion without investigation, and what is the unwholesome hurry to throw a young student into jail?
After all, the government is tolerant of people who celebrate the birthday of the assassin of the father of the nation.
Secondly, piling a huge police force on the JNU campus, making statements that JNU is "anti-national", and securing a general permission to search and take any student from the campus at any time are ill-conceived and politically-motivated decisions as we don't find any perspective in these measures on handling problems in public institutions; nor have the protocols for identifying wrongdoers from others been observed.
Rather we find an attack, blame game and use of brute police force in the name of nationalism against defenseless students. Even if some students have not been right in doing certain things, we are dismayed by the fact that the older persons in authority have been not just been lacking in sensitivity, maturity and balance to give young people an opportunity to rethink their priorities, but have also turned vindictive and mindlessly hostile towards them.
Thirdly, if anti-national slogans were indeed raised by a bunch of students, the proper and mature response to it would be to take action after a full enquiry that gives them an opportunity to explain their actions, a right which any human including a terrorist is entitled to. The aim of such an enquiry in educational institutions would be to make the errant students understand their transgression through dialogue and leading by example. Students are young and passionate. They also have great commitment to ideals, which are sometimes misplaced.
In a democratic country, the reasonable response to radical student activism is not to deal with an iron hand, but with a discerning approach.
Instead, right from FTII, HCU and now in JNU, what we are witnessing is an authoritarian and dictatorial attitude towards young people. The allegations heaped on them are but an attempt to distract the public from the uncomfortable issues that young people raise about the ills of our education system. The growing number of deaths and suicides of young people in the past few years is an indicator of the harsh reality faced by them in this country.
What is painful is that many incidents of deaths of young people in the recent past have occurred inside educational institutions-discrimination in HCU and overcharging and torturing of young women in a private college in Tamil Nadu and others of the kind. It seems our educational institutions are in danger of becoming pressure zones for students due to misuse of power by authorities. We have to seriously review our approach to students and this is the most important thing for Human Resources Ministry to understand.
Lastly, political activism is important to socialise youth to become responsible citizens. Skill development and technological education alone will only produce automatons. The experience of the rich and prosperous middle-eastern economies, and those of East Asia, where high incomes, smart cities and technological sophistication have been achieved without parallel efforts in building an intellectual culture, gender equality or democratic practice is indicative of what happens when the focus is only on economic growth and technology. In fact, such intellectual and cultural vacuum in a situation of material wealth is likely to breed fundamentalism. If we clamp down on youth activism, plurality of opinion and debate, then there would be no insight or creativity.  
Our educational institutions now have thousands of first-generation learners who are coming from remote parts of the country. They learn to live with people from diverse social backgrounds, to passionately explore manifold viewpoints and to treat women and others as equals, due to the ongoing culture of debate and discussion on social issues. As someone who came to JNU from outside and not belonging to any political party, I could see a qualitative difference in this campus in terms of intellectual passion and egalitarian values among the students.
JNU campus is probably the only place in Delhi, and among the few in the country, where women can walk alone, free of fear at anytime, in the middle of the night. I doubt that a government department can create a 1,000-acre space that is safe and hospitable for women. It takes years to build institutions, but days to destroy them.  
There are 700 universities in the country today and millions of students who are studying there. Indian students face problems like lack of classrooms, paucity of teachers and absence of library, water and toilet facilities. Girls get harassed and intimidated, while Dalit students get excluded. There is widespread academic fraud with the starting of numerous spurious and fake journals that have been set up to grant academic performance scores to faculty for recruitment and promotion. There is a collapse of quality measures in the assessment of academic performance and thousands of private colleges are mass producing degrees.
Any sensible Human Resources Ministry will focus on these problems that affect the multitude of aspiring youth in the country. Picking up isolated and small events, and targeting individual students indicates lack of vision and direction on the part of the ministry.(V.Sujatha is a Professor at the Centre for the Study of Social Systems, School of Social Sciences.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Dear Prof. Sujatha, tax payers' money is spent to educate students and not to create unruly mob. Let the students study and not indulge in anti national activities. If these things continue, the day is not far away when people turn against all aided universities. Please behave responsibly and teach good values to students.

                            Kanhaiya is punished as he is against ABVP/RSS,not because he is against India.A proper investigation should be carried and all shouting antiIndia slogans should be put on jail,even if they are RSS goons taking advantage of situation.

                            Professor Sujatha the way you have summed up your observation that education system in India is collapsing due to political pressure and that "defenceless JNU" students are being targeted is very saddening. Entire country saw what was happening in name of culture festival in JNU campus and professors like you taking sides of those vary students who were involved in spreading hatred for there own country. Is this JNU ideology to breed anti national elements and who are just following the agenda to spread talk separatism. India is democratic country and people have right to speech freedom of expression and have every right to have opinion. But I believe your institution has taken this freedom for granted and that's why you seem to be oblivious with fact that your students are working for Bharat ki Barbadi and praising Pakistan who is hell bent to jeopardise our nation's security. Had you and your so called defenceless students were in some other country and tried to something similar than all of you would have been out in jail without questions asked. You should thank indian system tolerance that you and remaining students are still walking free and you posting such opinions.  You and those JNU students who were involved in these anti social activities must be striped of indian citizenship and put behind bars. I am professional working for Indian MNC and posted outside India alongwith my other staff members Very firmly believe that indian government should come up with harshest laws to curb sedation and anti national activities.

                            Defenseless "anti-national" students, egged on by anti-nationalist Wahabi Salafists and then Islamic neighbours who hate them.... led to the destruction of Syria. I suppose you people want to encourage that in your ivory towers of JNU. Those who keep poisoneous snakes in their backyards, will be responsible when the snakes bite their own children to death.

If this is the value of education in JNU, we tax payers strongly demand to stop paying our hard earned money for such anti nationals. We further demand to close this political dens. never spoke a sentence for the army who are sacrificing their lives, not a single voice for hanumantappa or gaur.

Being professor, you need to first condemn the anti India  Slogan shouting and people supporting Pakistani cause on Kashmir and 'India ki Barbadi' . But in your commentary, that issue almost seems trivial . Viraj Kohli fan is jailed in Pakistan and u expect us to condone whole anti national slogans by some ungrateful folks who misuse the privilege offered by our Universities.

                            History has it that suppressing the voice of the youth has lead to revolution. Tiananmen Square is one example. The FTII students voice has been throttled, the HCU saw a death, now JNU is seeing an authoritarian clampdown. While Anti-national activities need to be dealt with a strong arm for sure, treating students like terrorists and criminals is totally wrong.

                            If Anti National slogans are carried out then obviously Nationalistic people will respond in this way. And if students are indulging in such activities then blame must be shared by Teachers who are responsible for teaching them good things. Teachers failed to educate the students in right way and failed to incorporate Nationalism among students. All these Anti National activities started in major universities during congress rule. Now it is time to clean up if not country will go to dogs.

                            As a 66year old with some experience of being a teacher and researcher in a good university I would like to record my uneasiness with the news coverage of politics in Universities.<br/><br/>
1. Students are in a University to study and teachers are to teach.  Teachers in fairness should present all the sides of any issue whether of evolution of species or of nationalism or universalism. Universities that have leftist or rightist academic/student bodies (JNU vs say IIMs) are doing disservice to the business of studying  the world.<br/><br/>
2. None of them have experience of being politicians. That is, of making useful compromises. Just being theoretical gets no one anywhere. Where are he student leaders of the 1969 Paris revolts or the Kent State University? <br/><br/>
3. Lets ensure that students study, when any student comes to a post-grad institution, he/she is prepared for academic (at times cold) rigour and teachers do research or teach. Real world activities (involving intellectual compromise) be done outside the academe.<br/><br/>
4. I recall many heated discussions with my students which left no scars on us. Why does it happen in these storied Universities?

                            "...political activism is important to socialise youth to become responsible citizens. Skill development and technological education alone will only produce automatons. The experience of the rich and prosperous middle-eastern economies, and those of East Asia, where high incomes, smart cities and technological sophistication have been achieved without parallel efforts in building an intellectual culture, gender equality or democratic practice is indicative of what happens when the focus is only on economic growth and technology. In fact, such intellectual and cultural vacuum in a situation of material wealth is likely to breed fundamentalism. If we clamp down on youth activism, plurality of opinion and debate, then there would be no insight or creativity." This is actually untrue, in the Middle East the opposite is true. Also, just look at The US and UK. There the students concentrate on skill development and technology education and becomd very successful in life. This professor's agenda is to brainwash students with left-wing politics. It is not necessary to politicise all education. In my opinion she is a danger to true education.

                            Wow what logic. No one is praising pro Godse celebrations. But can you equate that with pro Afzal show? Sorry to know that you are a professor because you are parroting the Yechuris and Karats of this nation. Godse and his supporters never aimed at destroying our nation or parliament. Their anger, although wrongly, was directed at an individual. The recent deplorable celebrations did not call for destroying the nation. If you think these are similar, then God save the country.

                            political activism is important to socialise youth to become responsible citizens- thats the moot point , they were hardly behaving like citizens leave alone students . now this political activism ( unbridled opposition to anything the govt does , which is unfortunately out of purview of the university - u do not have a cultural event celebrating a terrorist as a matyr and call it political activism ) is not what is needed of students .

Had you and the management of JNU taken steps to throw out anti national elements from the campus this situation would not have arisen. Here looks like you have knived and preached the culprits to wage a war against the nation.We urge Indian  government to investigate snd book the preachers like you along with the  culprits.

                            As citizens we should trust the State, and in the name of democracy and freedom of speech need not indulge in strong remarks, particularly when occupying responsible positions. Rather than straight away assuming anti-government stance just because it is not in consonance of fundamental atmosphere at JNU, it would be appropriate to influence students to calm down, handle the matter on evidence and legality through interface with Government, if not satisfied then approach the Judiciary. One should appreciate the good aspects of the same Central Government also. It has been able to deliver corruption-free governance, launched laudable social sector initiatives, working towards 'One Nation One Market' in Agriculture, activating manufacturing and reviving Industrial growth, Improvements in Defence sector, working actively to skill the youth and encourage entrepreneurial aspects etc. When the macro, significant national issues are progressing on good lines, then we should ensure that such incidents are not magnified beyond a limit to waste precious time and energy of vital elements of the Government and act as a hurdle in momentum of development.

                            Video Clipping is not really needed. Just the fact that the event was organised on the specific day, is enough to underline the intention. Afzal Guru was punished following the due process of law for an terror act. Organizing events in his support itself is Sedition and additionally we should also slap "Contempt of Court" charges.   If you feel otherwise, please resign and save some of our Tax Money that is being wasted on Professors who do not give right education to students and encourage errant behavior.

If Kanhaiya has not done it, fine;  let court deal with it and if you also dont trust Indian Judiciary ( of course you dont, as we saw JNU campus filled with posters on Judicial killing of a terrorist, who dared to attack temple of democarcy), you may please seek asylum or intervention of UN.

                            As is being advised by the writer, inquiry is underway. If the arrested student leader has indeed raised anti-india slogans, then he will have a chance to explain why he did so. But a person who lives on subsidy being provided by the country with tax payers money has no conceivable reason to raise slogans against the country. Secondly, every democratic country permits freedom and gives space to groups to vent their frustations if any. Thirdly, if these groups in JNU had such strong feelings about Afzal Guru and Maqbool Bhatt, they should have approached the proper forum like the Judicial Courts, etc when they still had time. And Prof. Sujatha appears to have become incoherent in her blog since she starts with the current incident in JNU and has meandered to unrelated topics like treatment of women in our society, paucity of teachers, toilets, etc and giving advice to Ministry of HRD regarding providing facilities to educational institutions all over the country. So, can she further enlighten the tax paying public whether the anti-national slogans were raised in support of persons who were hanged between last year and couple of decades back or for lack of toilets and other facilities in educational institutions across the country?

                            The JNU drama reflects on couple of things, like the upbringing of these people at their homes and their parents and the education level provided by the teachers. <br/>
It is the failure on the part of the parents and the teachers to inculcate the love for ones motherland.<br/>
I for one would say give him a one way ticket to which ever Islamic country he and his parents want to go to and cancel his Indian citizenship.<br/>
The JNU leaders parents had the opportunity to migrate to Pakistan at the time of partition, but chose to stay behind but have never accepted India as their motherland.<br/>
The teachers are equally responsible as the students.

                            If the government response is illegal please go to the court. Trying to advise the government on how to handle students is not your business when you do not assume any responsibility for order in the campus. Bharat ki Barbadi tak is not a slogan of an angry student. Even we were students and had participated in protests. this crosses all limits. The action taken should be a warning for any future student to raise such slogans.

                            professors and teachers' role is key in driving students in right direction. From the opinion of Prof. Sujatha, it's evident that professors are key culprit in moulding anti-social thinkings wihtin students with tax-payers hard earned money. Prof. Sujatha and all professorts - Please help to build the nation, students' career in your hands.  This is a nation proudly mentions the name of professors like Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Abdul Kalaam, please follow their path and become role model. Else, quit your job and join full time politics.

                            Violence and slogans to incite hatred against a nation (Bharat ki barbadi tak jung karenge jung karenge) is not something that comes from defenseless students!! There is always an option to ignore such activities. They have right to protest Afzal Guru's hanging and even Kashmiri rights. But they have not right to incite people to take down India. The same democratic India who taxpayers paid for their education. Campuses are for free thought &amp; ideas but not platforms from which violence is generated. It's for betterment of society not it's "barbadi". India is probably only place in world where students are used by parties for gaining political mileage. I am sure CPI(M) &amp; political bosses of SFI, AISF are very happy to use these as tools to gain mileage in an era where they are increasingly being pushed out by the electorate. Would such things be allowed in their ideological havens like China or Soviet Russia? Please do not take advantage of this peace loving nation &amp; it's taxpayers who have been providing for these rabble-rousers. Nothing positive has come out of them.

As a concerned professor, why did you not take any action against the students who put up posters all across the univ well before the event.<br/>
As a concerned prof do you consider a ruling by the Supreme Court of India to be unjustified and definitely encourage students to shout out anti national slogans.  Cannot believe that the concerned professors of JNU are not aware of who these students are.  Why are they protecting them if they feel that the innocent have been incorrectly arrested give the names of the guilty - unless they themselves are anti national. Also is it not the duty of the professors to pre-empt the ramifications of such actions and counsel the students well before rather than encourage them.<br/>
As a very concerned professor why was the sloganeering not nipped in the bud or do you consider that as freedom of speech.  How ill informed and uneducated you are.... Sad that students are guided by such narrow minded teachers who have no iota of what goes on beyond their four walls and are absolutely unable to give a mature perspective to student angst.

                            The Left has had control of a number of academic and cultural institutions in India for a long time and dictated the curricula and syllabi, not to mention authoring of text books. This has ensured that only a certain viewpoint, or a certain version was available and made to look like the gospel truth. At the same time, they also ensured that opposing or alternate viewpoints did not find a legitimate space and were eased or hounded out. With the emergence of the Right in a position of power, they are unfortunately using the same draconian and stupid tactics. Let Universities and colleges first be temples of real learning and open to multiple viewpoints. Second, let them remain free of the pernicious effects of organised politics- Kerala and Bengal bear witness to the deterioration of education thanks to such partisan and often brutal, politics in colleges. Third, the state too should take a chill pill and refrain from using charges of sedition etc on those who offer opposing viewpoints. There are other ways to tackle dissent than using other student thugs, or brute police force or the draconian provisions of archaic, British era laws

                            madam do you see some of the news debates where those students whom you claim falsely accused were making the same statements.

                            Sorry Madam, I tend to disagree with you in your opinion. These students are not school kids to explain to them that their action is immature and incorrect. These are grown up adults who know what they are doing and what will be the consequence. The university aided by Governemnet funding is to enable it to produce high quality intellectuals who can help in Country's growth. But whats happening is otherwise they are breeding anti national elements in the name of ideology. Left ideology is a sacred one it does not support traitors in any way. This is a country where Afzal guru had a chance to defend himself for 10  long years , would this have happened in communist ruled countries or the kanagroo courts held by maoists in certain placed in India.There are so many matters in India which requires attention and help from the Elite students of JNU, instead choosing such anti national elements topic is an example of the lowest level of politics JNU students are stooping to.

                            When ever the mother is angry,because her husband has not given her dues,she beats her child,to release her anger,this is because the child is weak,a similar thing is happening in JNU.

                            It is surprising how deep rooted these scums are in the system now. They account for less than 5% vote, but probably enjoy 70-80 percent of all educational institute, research center, NGO, foreign funded media. For last 60 years systematically they have destroyed the education system, policies of this country. FTTI HCU JNU all are filled up with such professors who are politically connected. There strategy is simple. Build your career at the expense of tax payer's money. Build a system where all are uncle aunty and take care generations after generation. Thats the reason they support Mulayam, Lalu, Deve Gowda. These are uneducated lots, so visible to all of us. The lots like above professors are clever. remains hidden. Essentially no difference

                            the difference between the two Dr. Sujatha is, the assassination of Mahatma, though very very regretable and needless to say very unpatriotic, was an act of political violence. The extreme Right wing did not agree to Mahatma's policies and thus assassinated him. Such killings have occurred through out history including that of Martin Luther King, JFK etc etc. Your deliberate attempt to dilute this issue with students screaming Pro-Pakistan slogans, undermining the the Honorable Supreme Courts judgement on Afzal Guru, not only constitutes Contempt of Court under Sec 2c, Contempt of Courts Act 1971, you are in fact promoting or articulating secessionist views by justifying what these imbeciles have done. You are a Professor and finally the responsibility of a Good Citizen of the Republic is carried in your shoulder. Reading your views here, I think you should be surrendering your Indian passport and migrate to Islamabad.

                            Appears there is something wrong with this institution. Global universities are competing how to improve education ranking this institution is busy with focusing  on unwanted things. If this is the attitude and priority of so called intellectual god only can save this nation.

                            It's not only deeply regrettable but to be denounced by all civilised means that educated professors support these completely misguided youth becoming a threat to national integrity and sovereignty  first and foremost the politics should take their hands and the law should take its course for what ever punishment it needs for a clear case of sedition

                            Imagine, you all are wasting money of every tax payer in this country. You cant go on and support all the terrorists who are planning to destroy this country. It is a weird alliance in JNU: Students who dont want to study+teachers who want to arm twist administration and government. So, both of them celebrate when things like these happen there. I really wonder How many of you attend classes regularly. the whole India know that you people do not attend classes in the name of 'freedom to move around'. You shout at anyone and call them fascist and imperialist just because you dont like her/him. And by end of your five year subsidised stay in JNU you have contributed to slowing down this country rather than uplifting the poor. Does anyone has the guts to show your attendance certificate from school? Colossal waste of national resources !

                            @Anonymous: it is time to remove BJP and RSS to be rulers of India. The faster it it , the better for India. They are becoming idiots in the name of development , but Indian economy is going down day by day. The facts of Indian economy is not clear.
