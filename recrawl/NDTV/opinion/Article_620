Headline::::I'm Gay, My Ma Placed An Ad Looking for a Groom For Me



DateTime::::2015-05-20T17:27:00+05:30




                                I think it's absolutely normal for any mother to wish for her son to settle down. My mother is no different. She's 57, and fears I'll be alone after she's gone.
Last week, she asked me a question any mom would ask her 36-year-old son: "Are you dating someone? Are you fond of someone?"
And when my answer was in the negative, my mom did what any Indian mother would do  -she decided to place an ad in a newspaper.
I've got six responses so far. 2 Iyers, two Muslims and a couple of others. Let's see!
But here's what happened. My mother and I had a hilarious discussion on the content of the ad -  should we mention the preferred 'gotra', the height of the boy, etc.? We both laughed.  
On a serious note, I told her that I wanted a partner who is vegetarian and an animal lover. Sure, I wouldn't judge people by what's on their plate - but these two things, I definitely want.
My mother's was an arranged marriage. She wanted a husband who loved Mills and Boon so they could exchange them and fight over stories!
My mother said that my grandmother would prefer an 'Iyer' - so that's how 'Iyer' was a part of the ad.  
Now, since my mother is internet illiterate, I decided to log onto releasemyad.com. I  asked her what newspapers she'd prefer.
She chose DNA because they had a whole section dedicated to LGBT. It was Wednesday, and I decided to place an ad for Saturday's issue. It cost about Rs. 1,000. On Friday night, the status on the website read - 'issue refund'.
I rang them (releasemyad.com) and asked what the matter was. They said they had no idea and that I should contact DNA.
I rang DNA and spoke to a lady who said there was a 'legal issue'. I was furious and asked her to put this in writing. She refused.
I then went to Times Of India's office on Saturday. Sunday is when their matrimonial section is released. I gave the ad's content to a lady at the counter. She read it and said "There is a grammatical error" (she was referring to us seeking a groom for a man). But she was very sweet and genuine. I explained to her that I am homosexual and that my mother wanted to place this ad for me. She was all smiles. She asked me to make the payment and sign a form. She showed me a preview of the ad and I was happy. She gave me a receipt that had this at the back:
I came home and she called me to say that their Legal team had rejected the ad. I was disappointed, and didn't collect the refund (of Rs. 2,300).
I rang Hindustan Times and Mid-Day, and told them I am homosexual and wanted to place an ad in the matrimonial section.  
Hindustan Times wanted an e-mail and said they would get back. It was Saturday evening. I mailed them but didn't hear from them.Mid-Day was fantastic. I spoke to this lady and told her about the ad we were trying to place. She had no odd reaction and so I thought she hadn't got it right. I said "Ma'am, I'm homosexual and I..."
To my surprise, she completed the sentence "Haan haan aap homosexual hain aur aapki mummy aapke liye shaadi ka ad daalna chaahti hain"
I was so happy. I wasn't carrying any cash so I couldn't pay for the ad to appear the next day - which was Sunday.
On Monday, Mid-Day sent someone to collect the money and the ad was out on Tuesday.
My mother said that the preference for Iyer was obviously not important. She said she wouldn't mind even if I marry someone differently-abled
I feel it's time we accept that we are biased and try and change our outlook.(Harish Iyer is an equal rights activist in Mumbai. He is the only Indian national to feature in The Guardian's list of 100 most influential LGBT people in the world.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Very disappointing Ad. It is casteist. Does it matter. Yes. Given that your are the No 1 Activist of Gay India and may well be called the Father of Gay India in near future. You going on caste lines does not show a good precedent Mr Iyer.

There is no end to this sick mindset. <br/>

                            Even though i don't understand LGBT mindsets, i must say they have every right to get equal treatment in the society. I was always taught to respect differences - just because someone is different from you doesn't mean they are inferior or wrong. A very important lesson from my parents to me. I so humbly wish all the parents teach their children the same.

                            After reading some of the previous comments, some people need to move with the times. And realise that we all deserve the right to find love and be happy. Irrespective of sexuality. I wish Harish all the best and pray that he finds what he is looking for.

                            It is absolutely normal for a person to be gay. There is no issue with that. India needs to open up. Gay is not at all a taboo in the west. India should also be on par with west.

                            Appreciate the ad. It is a courageous effort to come out in the open and search for a LGBT partner through an advertisement in India. Kudos to that gesture! One thing that I felt odd was that you/your mother specified the caste that you prefer. Given the fact that The Guardian( the British national daily) named you in the list of the 100 most influential LGBT people in the world for 2013 and also that you are a popular EQUAL RIGHTS activist, this sort of casteism was not expected from you. Just my opinion!!! Nothing offensive/defensive about it :-)

1) IYER preferred : I will cringe and tolerate because it is your choice<br/>
2) EVEN if I marry a differently abled :????<br/><br/>
You sir and your mom are the ones with a problem in mind, treating Non-Iyers &amp; differently abled people...err..differently.

                            The caste system is out of control in India. Even while searching for a groom for her gay son, the mother still prefers someone from her own Brahmin caste! The caste system is the biggest curse since it has discriminated against crorers for thousands of years and is still going strong.

                            homosexuality is unnatural and God doesnot made man and woman for this purpose. But one should not criminalise or look down these persons with special orientation. But HOMOSEXUALITY IS WRONG, UNDOUBTEDLY . one should be ready for correction. only God can help them to come out such feelings .making this a sensitive issue by playing victim card will not help the homosexuality, they should try to come out of this and should stop sending wrong message to next generation.parents who are supporting are not bold they are only helpless .

Its just a cheap publicity and waste of time.  No point in even discussing about same sex.  Its disgusting.

                            It's all unnatural that's the whole truth.You want to be unnatural and seek someone like minded so be it.But making it a right and sticking it out other people's face is a problem.If a certain media house doesn't subscribe to your unnatural ways you can't be too critical.You practice unnatural relationship in your life that's fine,I don't subscribe it that's it.But don't stick it out and fight for accepting your skewed thoughts.All the best.

                            Just to be in news people go to ny extend and this gay wnts to get only publicity.Getting response for his advt is not difficult because the world is having enough gays and most of them are in advt or celebrities.More over in the present world where girls make life difficult with their wierd and perverted demands, it is no wonder guys naturally become gays.This guy will definitely get enough response from middle east countries like Oman and Saudi as many youngsters are in that category.Good luck and may his tribe grow to ward off the evil partners from opposite sex.

                            I don't mind people being gay as long as they do not make too much fuss about it...<br/><br/>
And also not show out in public they are gay....Sexual orientation is a private affair, and you are gay or straight in your bedroom, don't bring it to the street onto others' lives....that is incorrect !

                            Is it LEGAL in India to have SAME SEX MARRIAGE? can anybody answer that question.Hindus believe that Shiva and Vishnu(two male gods) had sex and Ayappa(Manikandan) was born,but belief cannot over ride the law,can it?.

                            I respect his choice. He has every right to decide what he wants in life; But if this is the same gentleman who came in the season 2 episode of SATYAMEVA JAYATHE, where he said he was scared of men because of what terrible things happened to him in his childhood and so he was close to the woman folk of his family. hope it is not a trauma .

                            it is Mr harishs life ..if he is a gay even then he has a choice to make as to who is his life partner but without disturbing any other non-interested person in any way !<br/>
Hence  I really feel there is no need for such huge publicity for his personal matter..Let the  change take place silently If it succeeds then definitely time will take care of such future successes !  No need for such huge publicity even before marrying!..
