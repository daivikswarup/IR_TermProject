Headline::::PM Modi, This Bill Can Be Easily Passed. So What Gives?



DateTime::::2016-03-07T14:14:00+05:30




                                There is a strong dividing line between symbolic actions and just plain tokenism. Alas, the Prime Minister's suggestion that only women members of parliament should speak on March 8, International Women's Day, would fall in the latter category. Tokenism at its worst.
Are you serious, Mr. Modi? As far as women's representation in Parliament is concerned, among 141 selected countries, India ranks a low 103. India at just 12 per cent women in the Lok Sabha is way below the global average of 22.4 percent. Just to remind you, the Women's Reservation Bill has been pending for the last six years. Instead of bringing that Bill, you add insult to injury with a half-baked proposal.
Six years ago, amidst much drama, the Rajya Sabha adopted the Bill. It was listed to be passed on March 8, but because of the various obstructive methods used by the opponents of the Bill across political parties, it could be adopted only on March 9, 2010.
The UPA itself was divided. It took a great deal of pressure from women's movements, backed by the firm stand taken by the Left parties in parliament, to overcome the opposition. The Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, Dr. Hamid Ansari, refused to bow to the pressure of opponents who were hell-bent on getting the House adjourned. They created unruly scenes, including tearing up the copies of the Bill, jumping on to the tables and so on. A firm Chairman ordered marshalls to remove them from the House. None of us liked to see colleagues being forced out, but at that stage, we felt that there was no choice. After calm was restored, there was a discussion, and the Bill was passed. It was indeed a historic day which brought much joy to women across India.
At that time, opponents to the Bill had a large presence in the Lok Sabha. The UPA Government's very existence depended on their support. The BJP, being the main opposition party, took the position that they would permit discussion on the Bill only if the government could ensure the "House is in order." Clearly there was no chance of that. So the Bill was effectively buried in the Lok Sabha.
However according to parliament rules, since the Rajya Sabha is in continued existence, any Bill adopted by the Rajya Sabha is considered live and can be taken up at any time by the Lok Sabha.
With a comfortable majority in the Lok Sabha and with the highly reduced numbers of the opponents of the Bill, the Modi Government faces no such hurdles. The Congress, which had claimed credit for itself in the Rajya Sabha, obviously cannot oppose the Bill. The Left of course will extend unstinting support. The Government will easily have a two-thirds majority required for the passage of a constitutional amendment.
So why in the last two years has this Bill not been mentioned in any single agenda for parliament by the ruling party? Sushma Swaraj and Najma Heptulla and other BJP women leaders were very vocal when they were in opposition. Why are they silent now?
There was another important occasion on which the government could have shown its commitment to women a week before March 8. That was the annual budget. As a result of women's movements, for the last decade or so, the central government has to give an account of the money spend for women. There are two parts. Part A which is of direct benefit to women and Part B which benefits women in a more general manner.
Here again there is a lot of tokenism. New schemes announced with low allocations, a juggling of allocations with increase in one sector being on the back of a decrease in the other. No wonder the allocations under the Gender Budget as part of total expenditure remains low at just around 4.5 per cent, the same as last year.
The much publicized "Beti Padhao Beti Bachao" (education for the girl child) programme has received an increased allocation of just three crores compared to revised estimates and is now 100 crores,  while other schemes like Udhaan, Swami Vivekananda Scholarship scheme, Pragati and so on have received no allocations whatsoever. As pointed out by the excellent analysis in the report of the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability, the allocation of the incentive scheme called SUCCESS for girls in the secondary education sector is just 45 crores.
But worse still, the Nirbhaya fund to build an infrastructure to prevent crimes against women and to help rehabilitate sexual assault victims, has not received any funds at all. In fact, the scheme for the rehabilitation of rape victims does not find even a mention in the budget papers. The concept of crisis centres which were to be set up at block level throughout the country to help women victims has also disappeared. Over 600 crore rupees given to the Road Transport Ministry for provision of security for women has vanished into thin air. There is no fund for setting up the structures for the implementation of the legislation  against domestic violence.
More women have been killed in domestic and social violence in India than all those killed in wars that independent India had fought. Yet the government still refuses to put in place a social infrastructure which could be the difference between life and death for a woman.
Tomorrow, on March 8, we need to tell the government "Enough of tokenism and jumlas, take concrete action to reach  tangible goals, of which the passage of the Women's Reservation Bill can be the first. And also for good measure, change your gender lens, which seems to be completely blurred."(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Modi has yet not completed 3 years as PM but you (Left parties) have ruled WB for more than 30 years. What you have done at WB that its still one of the most poor, backward states in India...?<br/><br/>
Did women get equal rights like men during your rules of WB? If not than what right you have to question to Modi? At least he is doing better than you....he has appointed woman CM as his successor in Gujarat. Does Left has any woman CM till now?  <br/><br/>
So your record is poorer than Modi's record.....

                            Dear Ms. Karat, out of 16 members in the Politburo, just 2 are women - you and Ms. Ali. Which makes it 12.5% representation for women in the CPM Politburo. Which is fairly close to the 12% representation that the current Lok Sabha has. Maybe it makes sense to first fix your house before you improve the universe?

                            No one gives up anything. Why can't women MPs across party lines unite and put pressure on the entire political class to adopt the Bill. This would be much better cause to pursue than that of Kanhaiyas.

                            The Left in India is morally and intellectually bankrupt. Here Ms. Karat talks so passionately about reservation for women in Parliament, and failure to arrest crimes against women.  However, these same Leftist leaders will support rampant pornography and gay propoganad (as 'free speech' and 'human rights'), just because this has become the "Liberal' fashion in highly Westernized countries. The Leftists in Russia and China have realized the importance of cultural nationalism and refuse to comply with Western attempts to impose a perverted form of liberalism in the guise of 'human rights'.  However, the Left in India has no morals of any kind and is only interested in promoting 'divide-and-rule' and anti-religious agenda.

                            Rajiv Gandhi had 415 members in Lok Sabha and majority in RS. Womens day is celebrated invoking his name. No bill on womens bill was passed despite massive majority more than two thirds of strength of LS. Only bill on women rights which was passed was on Shah Bano depriving her rights despite Supreme court ruling. CPM of Brinda Karat is a supporter of Congress both now and during UPA I rule. Why double standards ? You kept quiet for so long and now you talk of JUMLAS. If this  is Jumla what is word to be coined for earlier regime. BETRAYAL.

                            Unless I'm mistaken, reserving seats for women would amount to thrusting candidates down the throats of voters who may want to vote for someone else. Mrs. Karat would do well to explain how that would be compatible with the concept of a democracy... assuming she and her comrades actually understand what democracy actually means.

                            This article is tokenism at its worst.<br/>
Apart from very bad represntation of women in party positions and government by CPM in West Bengal and Tripura,the whole party did dubious manouveres to stop K.R.Gowriamma from becoming CM in Kerala and went on to expell her from Party!!<br/>
Mrs.Karat herself was relegated from the central committee in the wake of her protest against the lack of representation of women in politburo. But the party found it an act against Leninist principles!!!!<br/>
Thier best friends and allies SP and RJD were the most vocal in obstructing the Lok Sabha to prevent the then Goverment in introducing the bill.<br/>
CPM was supporting the first UPA govt and they could have easily introduced the bill then!!!<br/>
And her frivolous arguement that this bill being brainchild of Congress would stop that party from opposing it in Rajya Sabha is even worse.Look at the fate of GST which itself was brain child of Congress!!<br/>
Last but not the least-she is the party to gang of selected(well they can ever get elected) MP who are obstructing parilament with everything and anything!!!

                            Respected Madam, How about CPM selecting Women Candidates to contest in 33.33% of Assembly Seats in West Bengal,Kerala,TN,Assam and Puducherry in the forthcoming elections to State Assemblies? So CPM should reserve approximately 100 Seats each in Bengal and TN, 50 Seats in Kerala and 35 seats in Assam exclusively for Women Candidates. Once, CPM takes the initiative, there are good chances of other rival parties following suit in subsequent elections and history will remember CPM for taking the GREAT INITIATIVE.The ball now is in your Party's Court, Respected Madam.

                            Rather thangive an impartial analysis of any given matter, Brinda uses every opportunity to attack Modi.  Her credibility is therefore lost.  That said, and in the interests of balance, Brinda would have been better received hade she set out the shortcomings of the women who, without the need for any reservation have obtained power and have caused havoc to India.  Take Indira Gandhi.  A power-mad woman if ever there was one!  Her policies of nationalisation, particularly the banks have caused economic damage that will take decades, if not centuries to repair.  Her divide and rule policies which caused the Sikh uprising has fragmented India.  Her Garibi Hatao is a mere slogan.  Next, Sonia Gandhi.  Although Manmohan was PM, he was merely the token!  The woman in power when such scandals as 2G occurred was accountable to nobody! Moving on to Jayalalitha.  She was even convicted of fraud!  AS fot Mamata, it is only a question of time before West Bengal collapses!  Empowerment to women by all means but that is not an end in itself!
