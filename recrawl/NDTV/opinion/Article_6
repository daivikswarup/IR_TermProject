Headline::::How Kanhaiya Stripped Bare The Biases Of TV Channels



DateTime::::2016-03-05T23:07:00+05:30




                                Today when I sit back in a corner of my room, I am reminded of Mason Williams who said, "I am qualified to criticise television because I have two eyes and a mind which is one more eye and a mind more than television."
But I also want to criticize TV for a different reason. I spent almost two decades in TV and I belong to the first generation of TV professionals. It is true that I am no more an employed journalist but my heart still beats for TV. I feel extremely sad today when I see the conduct of a few TV editors and anchors particularly in the context of the JNU episode and Kanhaiya's arrest. Once more the question arises about whether self-regulation is working or do we need an institutional framework like Ofcom in London.
What has been the issue all along these past three weeks? That anti-India slogans were raised in JNU, Afzal Guru was iconised by students in the campus and they indulged in anti-national activities, that JNU has become a den of terrorists (it should be shut down was the war cry by one of the more prominent intellectuals in the BJP, Chandan Mitra).
A few video tapes were the reason for the nationwide Hungama. TV anchors created a Tamasha in their treatment of news and debates; they called themselves nationalists and those who did not subscribe to their brand of nationalism were openly called anti-national. They were more jingoist than the members of the RSS/BJP/ABVP.I don't deny the fact that every channel and every editor has the right to decide his/ her editorial line, but this constitutional freedom doesn't give license to any journalist to compromise with facts and pronounce anybody guilty without waiting for the court's verdict. The building of our system of jurisprudence is built on the concept that every accused is innocent till proven guilty. But TV anchors, in their rush for ratings, have turned this upside down.
They pronounced Kanhaiya anti-national. They pronounced Umar Khalid a terrorist. Is their conduct constitutional? I have no quarrel with the BJP/RSS TV panelists if they call people opposed to their ideology as anti-national because they are practicing politics, but TV editors are not in politics and they are not politicians. Their primary function is to search for truth, and to analyse truth, put facts before viewers, and let people decide. I know TV has turned into a platform of strong opinions in the last few years. But this does not allow the confusion of fiction with facts and views with news.
Some TV channels have forgotten the fundamentals of journalism in the last three weeks. It is a cardinal principle of journalism that any fact or video which cannot be authenticated should not be aired. But since February 9, seven audio-video tapes were aired on almost all channels except a few. None of these editors bothered to check the veracity of these tapes. A few tried to be more correct and ran a declaration that the channel could not vouch for the authenticity of the video. This is hilarious. How can they put any fact out when they are not sure about its correctness? But happen it did, and on that basis, judgments were pronounced in TV studios.
Finally, the Delhi government inquiry found that out of seven tapes, two tapes were doctored and one was edited. These were no ordinary tapes. They disturbed peace, incited people to violence. Media professionals, JNU teachers and students were beaten up in a court room; the whole of Patiala House was turned into a war zone and Kanhaiya was thrashed; Supreme Court observers and senior lawyers were abused, jostled and threatened openly. Incidents of violence and vandalism were also reported from other parts of the country.
The Delhi government report on JNU has also given a clean chit to Kanhaiya. The inquiry failed to establish that he raised anti-India slogans or glorified Afzal Guru. There was no video evidence regarding this. The Delhi Police has claimed that they have eyewitness who will vouch for Kanhaiya's criminality. But the inquiry report tells a different story. It states that all three JNU guards failed to confirm the same.
 
Therefore the point is that if there was no video proof, no corroborative evidence, and no mention in the FIR of his seditious culpability, then on what basis were allegations levelled against Kanhaiya and why was he arrested on the charge of sedition? Why did a few channels, especially Times Now and Zee News run a campaign against Kanhaiya?
The Modi government can have an agenda. The Delhi Police might have worked under pressure. But it was incumbent upon journalists and TV editors to hunt for the truth and not accept the police version at face value. India Today and ABP news did try to investigate the matter, they did succeed in their endeavour and broke the story that some of the tapes were fabricated. A Zee News producer who resigned alleged that in one JNU tape, his office assumed that slogans of Pakistan Zindabad were raised, despite the inaudibility of the sound.
 Was it done deliberately or was it a mistake?
I am not willing to give the benefit of doubt to the TV channels that ran the doctored tapes; for this, I have a reason. There is an unsaid rule:  if incorrect news is published or aired, then a corrigendum is published after the discovery of the truth and an apology is tendered to the aggrieved. Here, despite the expos&#233; about the doctored tapes, the concerned TV channels did not bother to be truthful to their viewers. They did not air any corrigendum, did not say sorry. So then can somebody tell me why should I not assume that these TV channels were in cahoots with the ruling regime to help them further their political interest?
This is not the end of the story. The partisanship was so naked that when Kanhaiya was granted bail, one of these channels did not air the story at all. It was the biggest story of the day but the channel refused to acknowledge the existence of Kanhaiya. Similarly, when Kanhaiya was released from jail, the very same channel did not bother to carry it live. Was it done deliberately or is the person in-charge of the news room without any understanding of breaking news?
As a former editor, I can say that today, the credibility of TV channels is at its lowest. Editors and anchors don't command the respect they used to. To such editor/anchors, I want to tell a story that David Biancully tells in his book Teleliteracy. He says- "In February 1968, Walter Cronkite of CBS Special returned from Saigon and wrote a half an hour special on the Vietnam war. He wrote, 'It seems now more certain than ever that the bloody experience of Vietnam is to end in stalemate.' President Lindon. B. Johnson was quoted as saying if he had lost Walter Cronkite, he had lost Mr. Average Citizen." That was Cronkite's credibility. Johnson lost the election and America lost Vietnam. This was the power of truth and also of journalism. Alas, today in India, there is a race to tap TRPs and to also enjoy the trappings of power. Not what news should stand for.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            When news channels don't just provide news but take sides and provide viewpoints then such things are bound to happen. Looks like some channels are bound to make Kanhaiya as a national leader while some project him as anti national.

                            #कन्हैया_कुमार....<br/><br/>
आपका भाषण सुना जो आपने जेल से वापस आ कर दिया, सुना कि आपको ग़रीबी, भुखमरी, जातिवाद, साम्राज्यवाद और पूँजीवाद से आज़ादी चाहिये। मेरे विचार मे, इन सबसे आजादी पाने के लिए मन लगाकर पढाई करें, खूब मेहनत करें, कैरियर बनायें और आगे बढ़ें तो अपने आप मिल जायेगी आजादी और अापके साथी जो नारे लगा रहे हैं उनको भी ये समझायें। आपका भाषण तो अच्छा था लेकिन मैं आपकी बातों में लाजिक ढूँढ़ने की कोशिश कर रही थी, इसके लिये मेरे दो चार सवाल है ज़वाब देने की मेहरबानी करें<br/><br/>
1- आपका भाषण तो पूरा राजनैतिक था, तो ये पढ़ाई का ढोंग क्यों?? बाहर आईये और राजनीति में करियर चमकाईये और अपनी जगह किसी उपयुक्त छात्र को दीजिये जो पढ़ाई के नाम पर राजनीति न करे। पढ़ाई के नाम पर ये मुफ़्तख़ोरी बंद करिये, आपके राजनैतिक करियर पर टैक्स पेयर जनता का पैसा बर्बाद क्यों हो??<br/><br/>
2- ग़रीबी, भुखमरी, जातिवाद, साम्राज्यवाद और पूँजीवाद ... लेकिन ये नही बताया ये समस्या कब से है ? और इसके असली जिम्मेदार कौन है ?? ज़रा बतायेंगे ये सारी समस्यायें कब से हैं ?? या ये सिर्फ पिछले 18 महीने मे खड़ी हुई हैं ?? जो पार्टी 60 सालों से राज कर रही थी उसकी जवाबदारी कितनी मानते है या उनके शासन में रामराज्य था ??आप प्रधानमंत्री की सूट पकड़ कर उनसे प्रश्न पूछना चाहते हैं तो सोनिया गांधी की साड़ी पकड़ कर उनसे प्रश्न क्यों नही पूछते??<br/><br/>
3- आपके बताया नहीं कि ग़रीबी, भुखमरी, जातिवाद, साम्राज्यवाद और पूँजीवाद को कैसे हटायेंगे और इसका ब्लूप्रिंट क्या है या सिर्फ़ नारों से हट जायेगी ?? आज सारी दुनिया मे वामपंथ फ़ेल हो चुका है तो ये भारत में किस तरह से सफल होगा ??<br/><br/>
4- आपकी पार्टी की सरकार पश्चिम बंगाल मे 35 साल तक थी, आप बतायेंगे कितनी ग़रीबी, भुखमरी या जातिवाद दूर हो गया?? आँकड़े तो इसका उल्टा ही बताते हैं तो हम क्यो विश्वास करें आपका??<br/><br/>
 5- अगर भारत के संिवधान या लोकतांत्रिक मूल्यों में विश्वास करते हैं तो जनता के बीच जाकर, चुनाव लड़कर ईमानदारी से सिस्टम मे सुधार करते और ग़रीबी भुखमरी के खिलाफ लड़ते न कि जनता द्वारा चुनी हुई सरकार के खिलाफ ज़हर उगलते<br/><br/>
6. आपको पुलिसवाला अपने जैसा ही इंसान लगा अच्छी बात है पर बतायेंगे जिन पुलिसवालों को दंतेवाड़ा में आपके साथियों(DSU) ने मारा वो अपने जैसे लगते थे या नही ?? जिनकी मौत पर JNU में जश्न मनाया जाता है वो भी ग़रीब परिवार के ही थे जिन्हें लाल सलाम वालों ने मारा है<br/><br/>
7- आपको फ़ौजी भी अपने जैसे लगते हैं ना, तो आपके साथ कंधे से कंधा मिला कर जो नारे देते हैं 'भारत तेरे टुकड़े होंगे' कभी सोचा है उनके उपर क्या गुज़रती होगी ?? उनका मोराल कितना डाउन होता होगा ?? कभी सोचा है एक भारतीय की आत्मा तड़पती है जब JNU के ये नारे सुनते हैं "भारत की बर्बादी तक जंग रहेगी" आपको भी यही लगता तो आप कहीं विरोध दर्ज करते ना<br/><br/>
8- आप कहते है कि इस देश के क़ानून पर आपको भरोसा है तो कैसे आपके साथी तो आपके सामने ही नारा देते हैं ?? "अफ़ज़ल हम शर्मिंदा हैं, तेरे क़ातिल ज़िंदा हैंंंं', "कितने अफ़ज़ल मारोगे, घर घर से अफ़ज़ल निकलेगा",<br/>
पुलिस वालों से आपको सहानुभूति है ना, कितने पुलिसवाले संसद में हुए हमले में कितने मरे मालूम है या दिल में अफ़ज़ल से आधी भी सहानुभूति है ?? ये भारत की सर्वोच्च न्यायालय का ही तो फ़ैसला था फिर ये आपका ढोंग नहीं है तो और क्या है ??<br/><br/>
9- रोहित वेमुला जिसका SFI से मोहभंग हो चुका था उसका येचुरी के बारे में लिखा ख़त/विचार क्यो नहीं बताया?? क्योंकि वो आपकी विचारधारा को सपोर्ट नहीं करता ??मरने वाला इंसान कभी झूठ नहीं बोलता और dying declaration तो कोर्ट भी मानता है, जब रोहित ने आख़िरी ख़त में किसी को भी ज़िम्मेदार नहीं बताया पर आप किसी न किसी तरह से इसका भी राजनैतिक फ़ायदा उठाना चाहते है तभी तो ये मुद्दा बार बार उठाते हैं<br/><br/>
 आपकी असली समस्या है एबीवीपी, आरएसएस, बीजेपी और मोदी जिनसे आज़ादी चाहिये, आपको लोकतांत्रिक ढंग से चुनी सरकार नहीं चाहिये क्योंकि आपको पंसद नही, उसके जाने के बाद सब आज़ादी मिल जायेगी। भाषण की जगह बस एकबार अपना ही जजमेंट ही पढ़ कर सुना देते छात्रों के सामने, ख़ुद पर शर्म आ जायेगी और सारी ग़लतफ़हमी दूर हो जाय

All along before his arrest, he was shown in many the TV channels debating &amp; supporting Afzal Guru (it's a truth), so now will he first apologize for supporting Afzal Guru earlier...he has just turned his color now to suit u-tun politicians like you, that's all.

                            Is this guy sane? Violence can never be acceptable in any society. Besides, the same Delhi inquiry that he talks about found that the other 5 videos were genuine and to quote from the report of his own government, "anti-national slogans were raised in JNU". Those 2 doctored videos were not the only videos that incited the violence. The ones that were found genuine also incited the violence. No one condones violence, but this guy's logic for asking for an apology is absurd. The fact that the violence happened is deplorable. Trying to fix the blame on a particular channel is incorrect. Zee News should be taken to court and asked to apologise for lying - but NOT for inciting violence, which was anyways going to happen whether Zee News made the doctored video or not.

                            Again NDTV is selectively filtering the comments by allowing only those comments that support Kanahiya. My previous comment is still not posted, though there was nothing derogatory or nothing wrong with my that comment. I was just mentioning the hard fact the Kanahiya &amp; Umar came on many news channel debate earlier before arrest &amp; supported pro Afzal on his hanging issue. Will Kanahiya apologize for that first?

                            Ashutosh is no one to preach journalistic ethics. He was working for interests of aap even while he was still a journalist and was producing biased reports in favor of aap all that time. What absolute rubbish.

                            Kanheya Kumar is playing in the hands of politicians. He is a hard core communist. Speech he made after release on bail shows that. JNU has become a campus for harbouring such political aspirants by paying from tax payers money. Look he is not a serious student. Then why support such persons?

                            Dear Mr Ashutosh,<br/><br/>
thank you for this very timely article. Every single tv news channel has become so biased that i have stopped watching TV news altogether. The shouting and screaming, anchors who seek to create aggression, the complete absence of level-headed debate on ANY channel have made Indian news channels a joke. I read multiple newspapers and news sites in quiet,and try to formulate a  more comprehensive view of the day's events.

                            This is a case involving Govt of India vs Kanhaiya. Where did Delhi Govt come in? What is the need for Delhi govt to give a clean chit? So, Whenever Delhi Police files a case against someone, will Delhi Govt announce an internal inquiry? Will Delhi Govt go to court asking for his bail? Will Delhi govt send Rahul Mehra to fight for all those arrested by Delhi Police? This is nothing but carcass politics.

                            Media never apologises. Be it kanhiya or ishrat or afzal guru coverage when a section of media portrayed them as good and other as bad. PM modi was declared clean in gujarat riots, did media apologise?<br/><br/>
I agree, media if proved wrong, should apologise. NDTV Should start with apologising first.

They brought political pressure on nepal for this reason. Amitshah openly showed his hateredness towards minorities as many other leaders of BJP did even narendra modi during campaign ib bihar.

                            First things first, other channels have proved that their videos are authentic and they have also claim that you and your mama(AK) have vested interest in proving KK not guilty and they have proof for that as well. I didn't find anything amusing KK's speech, tell me one thing will you allow your child be politically active while pursuing his/her education. Secondly by supporting a Anti-social element you are only proving that you have only vested interest.coming to the topic of eradication of poverty do you have a plan, any idea, any suggestions. The only way that is accomplished is by schemes like "Skill India", "Make In India" and other innovative programs initiated by the current government.

                            The problem is that everyone tried their hands in the case for getting more milage. The main controversy is the corruption in universities is the process of doing Ph D and JRf.No research has been done by any of these universities wasting the money of the taxpayer. As rightly said by the Hon'ble Judge of the High Court to cut off the limb if it is causing pain and curse to the society. Without wasting taxpayers money these universities should be closed and higher education system should be revamped like that of US universities.

Through out this article you have mentioned BJP/RSS etc.<br/>
No mention of AAP, why kejriwal expedited the analysis of videos' why would Rahul goto JNU to support these antinationals when he himself did not know if audio was fake or real. or will you say that it is ok for them to make assumptions and support anto nationals. but BJP cannot make an assumption and not support anti nationals. what kind of an argument is that.<br/>
your article smacks of your opposition to BJP all through and now a days when ever you mention you immediately mention RSS.<br/>

                            Ashutosh, it is ironic that you should be writing on a website belonging to a TV Channel, about partisan reporting of other TV Channels when this TV Channel itself is partisan. They went gaga over the Dadri incident but kept a deafening silence on the Malda incident because it went contrary to their purpose of demeaning the incumbent Govt. They have not given publicity to the Ishrat Jahan exposure, by the then Home Secretary of the previous regime. So in effect, no TV Channel is non-partisan.

So rest 5 videos are genuine. Mr Ashutosh, will you please informed the nation, on record, what are the contents of those 5 video ? Please tell the nation and if anything objectionable, will your Govt raid JNU. Will the law catch the culprits ?

                            Mr. Ashutosh first of all who told the Delhi govt. to go for an investigation of the tapes? Aapki sarkar ko har kaam mein taang adhane ki aadat hai. Ap log galti se iss baar sarkar mein aa gaye aur aap jaante hain ki next time dilli ki junta aapko ukhad phenkegi isliye aap ye sab ghatiya cheezein kar rahe hain. Second thing, the slogans raised at the University were definitely anti-national. You also know it but won't say it because you and Chief Minister are cowards of the first order. You fear losing your vote bank. You fear Mr. Modi! If sayingn 'Bharat ke tukde honge hazar' and 'Bharat ki barbaadi tak jung rahegi' is not anti-national then WHAT IS? But aap jaise log toh chahte hi hain ke desh tukdon mein bant jaye taki phir aap logon ko bewakoof bana sakein aur aapki gandi rajneeti chalti rahe. But remember one thing...for every anti-national in the country, you will find 100 nationalists! And they will teach your party which is no longer that of a common man what Nationalism is! You also know that Kanhaiya Kumar was involved in organizing that "Cultural Event" which was to debate judicial killing of a terrorist. If you support that on the name of freedom of expression then you are also anti-national!

                            It is the prerogative of news channels to air whatever they feel their dedicated viewers desire.If for some channels the Ishrat Jehan revelations were important( Country's National Security issue),  others gave the Kanhaiya speech priority. It has been observed over the years that channels tend to bring into their debates persons whom the anchors feel support their view's and agenda.Most channels are funded and propagate the agenda's of their hidden masters.There were some anchors who Pre-National elections were hell bent on projecting the Hon PM as non-secular.The country thought otherwise and the Hon PM was given a grand thumbs-up and voted to power with absolute majority.Maybe these anchors have still not been able to digest the election results. Kanhiya's release is a conditional Interim Bail with strict Do's and do not's.  It is not a clean chit as many channels are projecting it to be. Having said that let us be clear that what Kanhaiya said in his speech regarding Azaadi from Poverty, unemployment, farmers suicides etc is more of a blot on the Congress party rather than the ruling dispensation. Since these problems still exist surely the party which has ruled the country for more than 60 years is squarely to be blamed. Kanhaiya proclaims to believe in the constitution of this country and by this measure it is appropriate that he respects the constitutionally elected PM of the country rather than make fun of him in a public place.It will reflect a good upbringing if he respects his elders like the Hon PM and women like Hon HRD minister rather than mocking them in public.Views and counter views are welcome in democracy provided they are put across decently.

                            Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (or National Socialist German Worker's Party) created in the Third Reich the most extreme and terrifying example of a totalitarian regime the world has ever seen. It is often wondered quite how a sophisticated and highly developed 20th century nation was politically overpowered by the Nazis. One answer, and a major factor in the Nazi's effectiveness as a political force, was that not only did they ruthlessly deploy violence against dissidence, but they also utterly mastered the art of propaganda, fabricating a national ideology around their twisted beliefs..

Just to get patronage of a group let us not paint antinational activity as freedom om expression. Kashmir or any state of Indian Union is integral part of India. Support of any word for independence emcee of that state cannot be done in our university which is being run with taxpayers money.JNU had been spoiled by group of academician who are enrolled from pool of leftist pool. Communist party splinted as a group supported Chinese aggression of India. CPM has such history. Most of them were put behind bar which include AKGopalan,EMS and so on. Current supporters of JNU has more or less similar leaning. So your certificate has no sanctity. So let us go with institution of this country. Court has not acquitted kk.  So let Ashutosh not assume self made applet  tribunal

But they were constantly defending the terrorist. Now that kanahiya is out of jail he say we didn't say any such things and the video was doctored. I need to know is it possible that: you never committed a crime, and you are being blamed for it in front of the whole nation, still you don't say that I didn't do anything but you keep saying that judicial system is not at par.

                            OMG what AAP and its band is doing for their political gains.  And Pappu joins them in this act.  How dare they try to make a wrong Wright by saying the same thing again and again.  What Rohith did in HCU, Kanhaiya did in JNU and still they want to defend themselves by bringing in cast politics and other unrelated issues.  And so called journalists like this man are spreading all false news on their pet channels.  This is the order of the day.  When police kill naxalites all human rights activists raise their voice against them but when naxalites kill public in the name of informers and police that never comes to the notice of these so called human rights activists. In their view only naxalites are humans.  And same way only goons who raise anti national slogans are good to these pappus.

                            Students  come to university to study and   should not for politics &amp; so many students wasting time for nothing. JNU is funded by the Government the tax payers money .  If you want to campaign  join a party  &amp; than  give speech , I am really surprised this guy is being praised what for ?

                            Ashutosh - watch out he is more a threat to Arvind Kejriwal than to Modi or Rahul ...if you patronize Kanhaiya he may be your new leader:-)

Whatever Delhi pice has done was absolutely correct and I don't see any involvement of BJP in it rather AAP is involved in this conspiracy

                            Look who is commenting and writing on JNU . The party of hypocrites , liers and people who are playing worst kind of joke in Indian politics even worst than most corrupt and communal congress and their cronies . What a fabricated report constituted by delhi govt to cite ? A government who has no credibility and definitely no credentials .  The irony is these people who stood with Anna and exploited him with fake patriotism are now doing everything to destroy the fabric of nation by openly siding with anti national characters of JNU , just to further their political interest .. Shame on you mr ashutosh , your real character unraveling every day and showing the real face of your type of journalism background which you had to quit because you were unable to compete with much better class in the field intellectually , morally and ethically ,people who live in glass door don't throw at others !!

                            Could U please enlighten me whether any Anti National slogans were raised in JNU, not necessary by Mr Kanahya , and if so what Mr Kanahya was doing being president of JNU. I am a apolitical person and honestly speaking I have not slept for that  night because of what some people raised some irritating Anti National Slogans  about our country, don't know about U .
