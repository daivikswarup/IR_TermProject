Headline::::Dear Deepika, Great Hair and Exposed Bra Strap are Not Empowerment



DateTime::::2015-03-31T16:32:00+05:30



(Shobhaa De is an established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator, who is considered an authority on popular culture.)
	I am not sure what the 'outrage' is about this time. Do people loathe 'Vogue' so much? Or do they just loathe....?
	I watched the VOGUE EMPOWER video ... and laughed!  Yup. It's that funny. Apparently, a huge number of viewers are not amused - they are enraged. The video has gone viral. And everybody is screaming -  it's an insult to women... how dare they reduce important issues to a meaningless photo-shoot? Is 'empowerment' about an exposed bra strap and a wind machine for Deepika's hair? Why did she do it?
	Ummmm...so why are we watching it?
	Let's start with Deepika. After her brave and seemingly sincere public admission about battling depression....after her cleavage war with the mighty Times of India... here's this cringe-making effort. Why? Sometimes, the wonky script reads like this: a dishy director, Homi Adjania ("Finding Fanny') flips for his muse (Deepika Padukone) while shooting a meandering, meaningless, tiresome vanity project (the same) in luscious Goa. Worse things can happen. The guy, ambitiously aping Almodovar, thinks he has found his Penelope Cruz. Once the movie is done, the poor chap can't let go. Voila - Vogue to the rescue. And the third film in the EMPOWERMENT series gets underway.
	Come on, everybody - this is VOGUE. It is a high-end global fashion magazine. Brand Vogue promotes and projects glamour that blinds. Period. That is the glossy's USP. Geddit?
	That still does not explain the bizarre rationale behind the My Body, My Mind, My Choice disaster. What were the people who made it smoking... err... thinking? I looked for the bhindi ... sorry,  bindi... on my forehead in search of a cosmic explanation. Had the universe expanded when I was checking the mirror? Should I be linking my 'odour' to my husband's 'anarchy'? I rehearsed my lines for our daily tea-time rendezvous - how would  hubby react to my dramatic declaration as he bites into his Digestive bikki to hear these words: 'I am not your privilege'? What if he retorts, "Don't  fancy yourself, darling!" Unfortunately, it's a tad too late to warn him, "To have your baby or not - my choice." We have had quite a few of them already.
	Deepika the flake, sorry, snowflake...in the video, tells  every woman, "I am the snowflake, not the snowfall, you are the snowflake." Matlab?
	Matlab, zero, boss. That's the point. Stop looking for bloody matlab in this nonsensical effort. Stop analysing something that means absolutely nothing. Watch it just for a laugh and forget about it. The really deep and meaningful questions the video raises have to do with the styling - how much mousse did Deepika use in her hair? Which other products? Spray or no spray? What about the amazing volume - natural or hair extensions? Who did the lighting? Did an international shampoo brand secretly sponsor the project? Is it a sly attempt at subverting the spirit of women who prefer shorter hair?
	Dekho - this is an existential, experimental video, meant for highly evolved aesthetes who speak a different language and live on another planet. The aam aurat can take care of her own damn empowerment issues. But the least she can do is get a decent blow dry before she steps out to assert herself in this nasty, violent, hostile, unfair world.
	As for me, this video really does not matter a dot one way or the other.
	My body. My mind. My choice.

                            Can not agree with Shobhaa De more. Deepika, please sit down for a minute and PLEASE THINK what you are doing. Fully agree that you want to help the Indian women. No question about your good intentions. However you ARE doing exactly the opposite. Please stop listening to your international friends , activists and advisers. Look what feminists have done to the women in the west. Women are SO EMPOWERED that they are thrown out of marriages like chewed up gums. Single mothers live lives of horror and work 16 hours a day to their sixties or to their seventies. Is that what you want to give to your dear women in India ? Don't you see Indian marriages and women live far better than the marriages and the women in the west ? Can you point out JUST ONE ANOTHER NATION where women have so much peace and respect as they get in India ? So, message to you is SHUT UP , SIT DOWN, THINK ABOUT IT AND PLEASE HELP THE WOMEN OF INDIA

                            She is an ambitious gold digger and fame seeker who criticises for publicity. I am not aware of a single fund raising activity or NGO she is genuinely associated with. People like her think they are doing the world a favor by existing and criticising..oh yeah and writing pulp fiction

                            For once I agree with her...if equality is empowerment then how does a woman become a privilege;!! Don't men get the same rights...imagine your dad committing adultery coz his choice...imagine your husband refusing to share the financial burden coz hey its his choice....ir your son refusing to work out even as his cholesterol levels rise....coz of his choice. Such choices like any allow society to function in a set manner, and no freedom is absolute no matter how liberal the society...if it were we would live in utter lawlessness and chaos.<br/><br/>
Frankly speaking, these upscale pseudo feminists have got it all wrong, right empowerment starts with education of women and not with blaming men.

                            Focusing on issues too much does not solve the problem. We Indians do it always. Few sections of society are not growing so tag them as 'backward' and reservation. There are problems with women, tag them with something(empowerment) and focus again. If you really want an equality then don't pay extra attention towards something, don't make it an attention seeking stuff. Make it usual. and Yes this is really a useless video, i did not even laugh on it.

                            I DID NOT FIND ANYWHERE where Deepika is talking about women empowerment! She is talking about decision to live by her choice - in other word Freedom. Liberty. What is wrong in that? Sobha is diluting Freedom with empowerment - guess she doesn't realize the clear distinction. To understand what real empowerment is - read recently published an article on German Chancellor Angela Markel in New York Times - the most respected and most powerful lady of the world whom even mighty Putin fears.  --- Kalpana Bhattacharjee.

                            Highjacking valuable news paper column space for just expressing self righteous openions which are a 1000 feet from ground reality and not actually working on issues on the ground doesn't qualify as empowerment either.

                            I never thought I would agree with Shoba Dey some day.I think the video is just plain stupid and some of the things it encourages is really harmful. For example, as a woman, I say having sex outside of marriage is not anybody's right if the couple have agreed to monogamous relationship which is the case in most of the marriages. Just imagine what NDTV would have reported if some male actor made the video that having sex outside of marriage is his choice or if all adulterous men came out and said it is their choice and no one have any say in it. Indian women must be empowered. There is no question about that. But real empowerment comes from education, financial independence, having any career she wants to have, having self confidence, changing the mindset of men who think women are second class humans. But at the same time, what else can you expect from Vogue. I am sad that brave actress like Deepika fell for this crap.

                            Deepika isn't talking about empowerment - just freedom and liberty. But since the internet forums are basically populated with men - and most of them BJP supporters - we're likely to see an avalanche of criticism and of course comments about how there shouldn't be too much freedom, how Indian culture is so much better, women should mostly stay indoors and safe and similar 'close-your-eyes-and-ignore-all-problems' behaviour.

                            Yes exposing the Bra strap was empowering to me, and it still is<br/><br/>
Because it's mine, it's my choice to keep it- the way I want – MY CHOICE<br/><br/>
I too don't take it all from Vogue's shoot on Empowering women, but I did feel empowered and continues to be, with my exposed bra strap. You mentioned, you don't understand how a woman feels empowered with the exposed bra strap! Now there are three straps, two on the shoulder and third on the chest, I am talking about empowerment through exposed shoulder straps. The state when the mind is so free to brood over the topics that holds importance to you, not to remain disturbed now and then with the thought is my bra strap peeping out. Is it ok on the left shoulder and now on the right? Your teenage friends, giving eyebrow flash, to secretly inform you – its peeping out, and you struggles to stop doing whatever you were, right then and cover up.<br/><br/>
In my teen and early twenties, my mind had to take a pause again and again to check if my stall (Duppata), is right over my breast, and not exposing the tight kameez I am wearing under it. I did not understand the logic at all, why women wear stalls? Why to hide one's curves that's natural? It was very stressful. Decades back, I said bye to duppata; I am not going to pick it again to cover my breast, but to match it with current fashion trend. A good bye to the panic attacks to cover-up bra straps, it's their choice they want to sneak out, stay exposed or do whatever they want. I feel really empowered now; I do not have to ponder about it, as it doesn't matter at all. It's my Body, My bra strap and my choice!

                            how much drama will these bollywood people do to promote movies. This is pathetic. No this is not enpowerment. I know NGO's that actually work for women enpowerment without having the need to show off like this. Stop using enpowerment to promote your movies (along with ur fake depression stories)

This video actually degrades women!!!!!

                            I think Pema has got it right. Many people are missing the point of the video. We need to realize that a woman has every right that a man does. Men cheat all the time and no one resorts to violence towards them. Men can wear skimpy clothes without the threat of sexual violence. <br/><br/>
Our society believes it is the prerogative of a husband, father, "neta" to decide what is and is not acceptable behavior. If a woman commits a crime, the law can handle it. If a woman is rude to you or cheats on you, feel free to stop associating with her. That's the extent of control you are allowed to have. Beyond that, mind your own damn business.

                            I wonder if Deepika Padukone on her own even knows the spellings of empowerment. The likes of Deepika Padukone are always on the lookout for opportunities to grab the limelight. It would be asking for too much if we expect her to understand the issues involved. Carry on Deepika, you are doing a good job. You really know how to exercise your empowerment - A dumb comment here and a bit of skin there! You will go far.

                            Well firstly lets keep Shobha De aside, like a muted Whatsapp group conversation, the topic of which we all care about (and is reason for us to join the group in the first place) but are forced to mute it for some intellectually debilitating group member (read Shobha De) who post unrelated adult jokes there, constantly and incessantly. Now to the point of discussion, with the sorry state of women in India, where over the years they themselves have forgotten to believe that they are the equal half of the society, such messages are needed from time to time help them keep the goal in mind i.e gender equality. This is like a war cry to motivate them and help them not lose their focus midway. I don't see what the fuss is all about here, is it Deepika (Shobha de is just jealous of her beauty), is it the way Homi Adjania presented the message(its a Vogue commercial - a marketing campaign with social awareness. It will definitely have a for profit motive) or is it about India's sensitivity to the institution of marriage (the target urban middle and upper class audience have an increasing propensity of engaging in pre-marital or extra marital sexual affairs, the video only puts that to the context of individual right to choose  what they do. The underlying assumption is that individuals make those decision with full awareness of legal/social consequence thus asserting the fact that its a conscious choice,right or wrong its their choice). I think the underlying message is loud and clear, a woman has absolutely every freedom to make choices they want in their own capacity and be ready to face the consequences for their decision as well. But unfortunately, the target segment of vogue has way lesser utility for the message than the consumers of Nirma washing powder or Vim bar. I honestly hope more such campaigns are initiated to reach out to the base of the class pyramid so as the true oppressed class of women are exposed to ideas of absolute freedom and their freedom of choice. And I honestly hope that Shobha De is never ever referred to as opinion shaper and social commentator, for if that is the case, we would soon need campaigns on intellectual resurrection of not just women but the country as a whole.

                            I saw opinions supporting and opposing the article. I have however one simple question. Each man and woman must ask self about who is happy? Whether it a married Housewife taking care of house and family to the extreme of independent woman (?) who probably is single mother living with kids alone, doing job, living with whoever she likes. Same questions about two extremes of men. <br/>
Who is happy finally?

    I defend Deepika and the video, yes we all as women have choices ,but more importantly the choices voiced in this video on SEX,HAVING CHILDREN &amp; Freedom of thought are the CORE areas where women are more OFTEN deprived from it .<br/>
          Since Mrs De you keep using YOUR CHOICE so often to mock any person who do not fall in your perspective ,you should be the last person to condemn such a video.<br/>
Why so much HYPOCRISY Shobhaa De ,<br/>
Yeh aapko bilkul bhi Shobhaa nahin deta <br/>

                            This is a prime example of India's knee jerk idiocy. Deepika is doing women of the country no favours with this half baked, pretentious wannabe piece of crap ad. True empowerment is not about the freedom of choice to sleep with other men in a marriage, and believe me, no self respecting 'empowered' woman in the west will make that proclamation in public too. True empowerment is about having the right and the freedom to be independent in a responsible manner and standing up for one's right to be respected. That's what women need to really focus on. And that's what men and women need to collectively fight for - for honouring and respecting women, irrespective of her background, colour, status or education. And for crying out loud, stop making women look foolish by making immature, pseudo intelligent, crappy ads like this. Bottom line, Deepika is a very poor ambassador for women's empowerment. Honestly Rahul Gandhi did a much better job. Let's have men and women fight for the rights of women and do it in a smart and responsible manner. Good one Sobha De. #heforshe, #sheforshe

                            You totally missed the point .. <br/>
Choice 'matlab' option. And you are making it sound like a 'decision', <br/>
have you forgotten English Shova?<br/><br/>
Is she saying that she would "Choose" those bad options of having an affair outside of marriage or what ever? No right?<br/>
She is saying, one does have the option to do all that, at the end, its HER options, not anyone elses. As a result, its HER responsibility, and HER burdain to carry. And that is DEFINITELY empowering.. <br/><br/>
You have completely missed that.

                            This article talks about how bad the video is but have you every realized how STUPID this article is? The big issue the video talks about is Women Empowerment but instead the article talks about Deepika's hair spray and styling. I agree that it is your choice to dislike the video but don't talk about irrelevant facts about the video and please FOCUS on what the video talks about. IT IS NOT ABOUT HAIR SPRAY AND STYLING. As women we all need to stand up for equality if not it will never get better. If all of us chose to ignore such important matters when will the world get better? So please stop this nonsense and and focus on what matters!

All the respect I had towards you when you publicly came to let people know about depression and its effects have now sidelined. I now believe that you did that interview only for the sake of publicity. I now really doubt if you seriously suffered depression.

                            Deepika first learn to wear proper dress then you speak about women's empowerment. Empowerment has a broad meaning its not acting in films for money, wearing horrible dresses and speaking like a brainless child. Do you have slightest knowledge about Indian culture ??????

                            We can judge or concludes from the reactions of Indians how much prejudice and bias minds these people are. They have prejudice against some one because he or she is not belonging to ModiBhakt or SOnia Bhakt ideologies or criticised their demigods before so they take this opportunity to take revenge for their comments against hindutwa hypocrisy. Majority of commentators here are from similar background. There is hardly any substance in their critics.

                            All the people who have a problem with her mentioning " sex before marriage or outside marriage, my choice" , are you saying the women who don't have sex before marriage or outside of marriage, do so because they don't have a choice??? <br/>
I don't think so, make that decision because they don't want to, that option is always there.This is just to remind everyone that one should not take women's fidelity or other things that the ad talks about for granted! But should respect her for the choices she had made till now...after all isn't that the biggest contributor to our Indian culture that we are so proud of! India culture didnt come into existence by itself right? Isn't it a result of the choices Indian women have made till date?

They have no idea what goes in the world. To them the world just revolves around these things. Just create controveries to be in news when ur movies are being released. very bad

I am sure the likes gained by this youtube video is almost by the teenagers, who are not matured enough &amp; blindly follow the celebrities.

I agree to the above to the extent it does not lead to wilderness and based on righteousness and not sin full ways/means.<br/>
I think one understands the simplicity of life in soberness  unless the person is  subjected to otherwise showing of the happiness, which lacks substance.<br/>
Our  HEART is the biggest barometer to judge and feel the happiness.<br/>
And not necessarily many intellectuals going for the first line of this note, listen to their hearts.

                            The theme "My Choice" is really good. But the actions and dialogues are strange! I would say the imagination has gone wild beyond its limits. Let us be careful - "My Choice" and show your skin will have its consequences. Decency will bring in respect and empowerment and not outrageous stripping!! The problem is not about the advt - we will forget it soon but the perception on Deepika: She just lives for through day as a split personality - She talks about human well-being and next day she says its my choice to have sex anywhere and everywhere. The humane in her should be conscious of the professional choices as well.

                            Well said Ms. De. The manner in which Deepika is going one is inclined to believe that the public disclosure of her "battle with depression" is a publicity stunt, set up by her PR advisers. Same with her public outrage against Times of India, for their cleavage news. Considering that her star appeal is at a steep decline, she seems to be desperate to create publicity for herself.

                            Not sure why Shoba is getting so worked up?? Its an interesting video of various attractive women making a point that is rarely heard in India - that a women is not just someone playing out certain roles assigned to her by society, but that she has a choice in the matter. Its not an award winning effort, its not aimed to uplift rural masses, its not the voice of the age or any such grand thing. So not sure why people like Shoba De are so agitated and have to be so snarky??

Shobha De and other self appointed female role models are outdated relics who cannot wrap their heads around such unabashed openness.  <br/>
Its 2015, so I have empathy for modern liberated females like Deepika who are still stuck in premitive societies that are still judging females for how they want to live their own lives, worse is being negatively judged by women who should be first in supporting them.

                            i think for most of us feminism is all about rebellion. Redefining woman against the normative criteria. This is not the truth, being a woman is about 'guarding' the mind and the body of women. Its not asserting one's individuality rather getting an identity among the collective minds. Living in the society with respect rather than being a loner in the midst of thousands. Women please accept your life doesn't end with you.
