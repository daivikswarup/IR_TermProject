Headline::::I Knew Sunanda. But I Can't Say If She Killed Herself



DateTime::::2015-01-07T15:49:00+05:30



(Suhel Seth is Managing Partner of Counselage: India's only strategic brand advisory.)With due apologies to Shakespeare, there is obviously something rotten in the state of India. We have invented the art of public trials with allegations which are hurtful and insensitive and made a mockery out of every institution that is supposed to be righteous and moral.When Sunanda Tharoor was declared dead on the night of January 17, 2014, even she wouldn't have imagined how her death would spark indignation and rage, conjecture and mystique, but rarely empathy and grief. The fact that the investigations into her death were more of a public spectacle rather than getting down to the truth is what saddens me. Let me make full disclosure: Sunanda was a very dear friend of mine and I knew her long before either she met Shashi Tharoor or before I knew Shashi. I became a friend of Shashi's because I knew Sunanda. Did I know Sunanda so well that I could jump to conclusions about her vivacity or her joi-de-vivre? I guess not. And no one does. I am amazed at the utterances of her so-called 'friends' who are near certain that she could have never taken her own life. I, for one, will not jump to such conclusions. All three possibilities are up in the air. She could have knowingly taken her own life; she could have accidentally overdosed on whatever she is supposed to have been taking; or someone could have killed her. The fact that on the afternoon of January 6, 2015, almost a year after Sunanda's passing on, the Delhi Police Commissioner, a fine cop at that, says in a press statement that hers was an unnatural death should suffice. The Commissioner went on to add that samples would be sent abroad perhaps for better results and I guess neutrality is something we should consider responsibly. But then what erupted on social media and then in the evening on national television is distressing. Many on both platforms were vultures and nothing less. People forgot that in the wake of her death she left behind a crestfallen husband, an orphaned son and a family immersed in grief. But then do we care about all of this? We don't. Because we have become a nation that lives in the moment. We live to make other people fall. The alacrity with which Shashi Tharoor was condemned was initially amusing but later very anguishing; add to that the grand-standing by the two national political partiesÂ  and this whole trial-by-media comes across as sordid and pernicious.We cannot hope to be a civilized society if such is the brand of our behaviour. We cannot hope for the rule of law to prevail if television anchors become cops and judge every evening. We cannot hope for fairness in justice if investigations take so long that they lose both steam and credibility and this is what happened with Sunanda's death.It is not my place to conjecture how she died. That is for the police and the courts to rule. But it is my place to sound an alarm at our societal norms. We did that more recently in the Aarushi Talwar murder case and we are doing it now. We are slowly morphing into a country that operates on intolerance coupled with unbridled rage, both of which have no grounds to exist in a society that wants to progress on the back of dignity and equality. Something will give way.In many ways, just as when she lived, in her death, Sunanda Tharoor is teaching us one vital lesson. Being human is far more important than being judgmental. And I wish for her sake and for the sake of this fine country, we learn the lesson and learn it well.Sometimes the dead teach us how to live. And I hope we learn this lesson with equanimity and humility.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Thank you for this article... exactly what was in my mind.... In many past articles in this website regarding her death, people crossed the limits of decency while commenting. How she died is something for the police to find out. If someone is found guilty, I think everyone should be happy to see that person brought to books. But passing lewd and personal comments about someone whose family member has passed away not only show the character of that person but also their education and upbringing.

                            For a change, Shuhel is speaking sense and I cannot agree with him more that the television media today is rotten and declares judgement on people harming them forever without taking any responsibility. Shame on them.

                            It appears that Mr Seth is suggesting no further investigation should be carried out as it will emotionally affect certain people But he should also realise that a person has lost her life and the truth should come out and if the rare culprits should be punished.

                            Couldn't agree with you more ! The 'orgy' of debates in the news channels have led us to this framework of mind where we are insensitive and have scant regard for people's feelings. I am no fan of the congress, but we have one anchor who screams his guts out asking for Tharoor to come over for an interview - 'an open challenge' as he shouts! As someone rightly said 'it is a thousand times better to have common sense without education than to have education without common sense'! Salute our villagers who have more poise and grace than the city elite...who are desperate for such sound bytes from an intellectually bankrupt media!

                            1. To begin with nobody accused you of being a Tharoor PR man. So you don't need to begin with a disclosure or justification.<br/>
2. What the average person kept hearing for a couple of days preceding her demise, the sudden-ness and circumstances of her demise, and the fact that she was who she was, would make most people think that, with due apologies to Kalidas, daal mein kuch kala hai.<br/>
3. A ruling-party MP's wife dies, in suspicious circumstances in a hotel in Delhi and when people ask what happened, you call them intolerant. Really?<br/>
3. The brand of behaviour which you now decry, and the noble idea that you now profess - being human being more important than being judgmental - seem odd coming from you.

                            The only fact which has been proven so far is that Sunanda Pushkar died of poisoning. It has not been proven whether she took the poision herself, or someone else injected the poison into her. It is immature on the part of the police, Subramanian Swamy and the media to jump to conclusions that Shashi Tharoor was an accomplice in murder.

                            Suhel Seth cannot be more correct! There is a general degradation in our society, where instead of each one minding his business, everyone now has something to say about others' business! On prime time TV, we see a spectacle of a pack of wolves hounding after one individual who may or may not be guilty of something. It gives vicarious pleasure to all, I presume. Prime time TV makes India and Indians look like cackling geese, noisy at best, predatory at worst. <br/><br/>
Having said that, one must also remember that "vigilante TV" was responsible to bring to book several criminals who otherwise would have got off the hook. The Jessica Lal case is an example. <br/><br/>
But can we have some moderation, some less noise and more dignity in our TV  programs?

                            Sunanda died that is the fact,it is unnatural death ,it the fact.Delhi police is investigating the case is the fact. But on TV channels at prime time the tv anchors shouting from roof top that nation wants to know about the killers of Sunanda.Is this the journalism?Is this the freedom of expression?Come on let the nation have its priorities right.These accidents happen everyday in this big nation and these are very unfortunate incident but are these national events?What some Sadhu, SADHAVI Padri or Mulla said can be a national event? The nation is fed up with India media particularly from TV news channels.There are four five individuals who are taking this country for a ride on prime time on tv channels.I do not know how these can be tackled. But some agency has to step in to tackle these media goons.

                            It is not about "media trial". The media has a responsibility to expose the high and mighty if there is something fishy. Have we forgotten "Jesica Lal".<br/>
And I am sure Suhel, who calls himself Sunanda's "friend" would want to know the truth like all of us.<br/>
After all, why did Shashi Tharoor tried to influence the postmortem through his now discredited "Lopus" theory.<br/>
The fact that the couple had an ugly fight just 2 days before Sunanda died (or was killed!) and the fact that she died (or was killed!) before she was to make some uncomfortable disclosures are well established ones.<br/>
Media is correct in asking these uncomfortable questions.

                            Suhel , you should ashamed on yourself before calling yourself friend of Sunanda Pushkar, but not attempting to know who had killed her. She had fought with her husband, Tharoor  before she was found dead,  post mortem doctor in Delhi alleged earlier that Tharoor was trying to influence the medical investigation, now a year after Delhi police reaching on conclusion that she had been killed. But, you still think (as indirectly you indicating in your article) that Tharoor is innocent and the police-public should keep him out of suspicion. You have every right to express your opinion Mr Suhel, but I found it objectionable because you are trying to back it after stating your close association with the deceased. Your reticle clearly indicating that you are trying to protect Mr Tharoor.

Shame on some channels who put her pictures (dead) and equally shameful of some who mentioned that they were not putting her pictures but castigating her personal life. Last but not the least shame on you Delhi Police &amp; the Docs who are not able to deliver of what we expect from them.

                            the article by Suhel Seth is indeed most responsible and respectful to the memory of the deceased. the stand by political parties on the matter is  only 'politics' and need not bother us. But what is disturbing is:<br/>
1. Should it take the Delhi Police/AIIMS so long to conclude  that it is 'murder' and not suicide.? That is a sad commentary on the efficiency/ efficacy of the Delhi Police to unravel unnatural deaths.<br/>
2 The visual media needs to be more disciplined while presenting news and not behave like street performers.

                            This is a matter of public interest and the public has a right to know.  This couple made themselves media darlings and they (albeit one in death) are paying the price.  Sunanda was a virtually unknown character and not worth knowing except in her own circle of weirdoes.  She started as an Indian citizen, went to Dubai, then went to Canada where she decided that being an Indian citizen was not good enough for her and chose instead to become a Canadian.  Why even the name Sunanda was not suitable for her, preferring instead the western sounding Su!  Obviously, while Canadian citizenship was good for her, the lifestyle was not and back she went to Dubai where you find various shady characters from the sub-continent thriving.  She was at her element in such an atmosphere, moving from one party to another.  Along came another chancer, Shashi Tharoor and in those very party circles met the fair and lovely Sunanda.  Ere long, a shady deal was discussed (or not, as the case may be)involving a Cricket Team.  this was par for the course, Dubai being a shady place where shady characters do shady deals.  Tharoor was out of his depth as evidenced by the stupid message he sent to the shady Modi.  Not, I hasten to add, the Gujarati Modi who is our PM but the Marwadi Modi who was behind the IPL.  The message asked Marwadi Modi not to disclose that Tharoor was behind any deal.  It appeared that the fair and lovely Sunanda, an Indian origin Canadian citizen resident in Dubai had acquired such skills that her 'sweat equity' in respect of a Cricket Team in Cochin was worth US$ 10 million!  In the dog-eat-dog world, Marwadi Modi made this message public.  Naturally, Gujarati Modi described Sunanda as Tharoor's 50 crore girlfriend!  Tharoor had no choice but to marry the fair and lovely Sunanda.  Sunanda of course, thought that she was marrying the future PM of India.  No such luck!  Tharoor had chosen the wrong party (Congress) and he, together with his Congress pals were booted out of office by the cattle class people of India!  Tharoor, as is his wont (remember the two failed marriages before the fair and lovely Sunanda), was not averse to expressing friendship with members of the fairer sex, be they Bengali (first wife), Canadian (second wife), Kashmiri (third wife)or even Pakistani (possible fourth wife, one Mehr Tarar).  Naturally, the fair and lovely Sunanda could only see her hopes as a future Mrs Prime Minister vanish into thin air and as a lady in her 50s had no gas left in her tank!!  When there is a threat of something shady relating to a Dubai deal involving a Cochin Cricket Team being revealed, it is time for 'lights out'!!! To use Seth's words 'vivacity and joi-de-vivre' which are largely meaningless to cattle class people such as myself, there was not the remotest possibility that the shady lady in her 50s would be able to exhibit such attributes.  There remained only disclosure which, sadly other people would not tolerate!

The commoners use social media to speculate how Sunanda Pushkar was suicided while Suhel Seth would have done the same via cocktail circuits.

                            Well whatever lessons you imagine she is teaching in her death might be your way to console yourself. But it is equally important to be human and to be an intelligent human being with the ability to judge things in their proper perspective in the light of facts, evidence and circumstantial evidence brought to light by the incident. Else all your life you will continue being fooled by unscrupulous people in the society with the help if their equally blunt acquaintances. So it's very important to keep our minds open; and to reach the bottom of truth about anything it's most important to keep asking questions however hard they may seem at the moment on those affected, for after all I'm sure they seek the truth too and would fully agree with it to attain a far long lasting peace of mind instead of trying to stop the people from thinking and questioning. It's not a normal petty incident to be hushed up, but a very disturbing, abnormal incident that has affected a sane, intelligent, genteel person and cost her her life for some bizarre reason, and it's natural for people to question and get justice for her real folks and kin.

                            The media, always anywhere in the world, wants to feed and somewhat reflect the mood of people who watch it. It is such public in India who don't let normal system function in government or elsewhere. For example, look at the crowding etc. in an area of an accident that only prevents correct help to reach there. What does such a crowd do? Enjoy a free tamasha and exchange by conjecture what should have happened. Nation should correct this malady.

                            The author has failed to mention statement of the  victim that the journalist had had an affair with her husband, the publicity given to Aarushi murder case and the consequences. He should remember but for the publicity by media Rebecca murder case would never have seen the light of the day, so is the case with the child's murder by the dentist couple. The dentist couple while proceeding to Haridwar for performing last rites, directed the police to look for Hemraj on the terrace of their house after two days of the event,  an after thought which is crucial evidence of deceit. It is very essential for the investigation to go ahead and fix responsibility for any wrong doing , if any.

                            well said Mr Suhel Sheth, but you yourself are telling that you do not know whether she killed herself, somebody killed her or it is accidental due to drug overdose.  Let the investigators do their work, let the media do their job and you cannot avoid sensationalism when there is a tragedy like this.  And it happens in every society which is eager to know the truth.

                            This is precisely what happens when every case is decided based on media trials and conclusions drawn by the public based on such media debates / trials. And if the court finds any thing contradictory to what the media trial led to, there would be anguish among the public as if the courts were wrong. The media should limit itself to publishing the facts, without even trying to suggest what the fact could mean (based on its own interpretation). But each system in the country is self-centric and media is possibly the most, with so many channels vying to compete with each other and jumping the gun by tom-toming 'we are the first to figure it out'. Having said this, it is equally important that out justice system is made more fast and speedier justice delivered. It is all the more important that the legal system gets rid of the unscrupulous lawyers, who by hook-or-crook try to take advantage of their talent to interpret and the gullible judges who fall for it (ignoring the fact that while no innocent should be punished, it is equally necessary that criminals do not get way through mere benefit of doubt as cast by the defence lawyer rather than being judicious about the reasonability of such false claims). It is important that the general public feel that justice is always delivered (and faster) and people retain the faith in the system.
