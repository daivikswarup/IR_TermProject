Headline::::How Rahul Gandhi Rewards Family Loyalists



DateTime::::2015-02-02T20:35:00+05:30



(Ashok Malik is a columnist and writer living in Delhi)
	Grant the Congress and the Nehru-Gandhis this: they retain an extraordinary ability to influence the media in New Delhi.
	Sanjaya Baru's The Accidental Prime Minister referred to an intellectual ecosystem that sustained the Congress' First Family in the 1990s, even when it was not in power. The Jayanthi Natarajan allegations have established the verity of Baru's words. As a senior BJP politician put it recently: "[B.S.] Yeddyurappa stayed on the front pages for a year, but Jayanthi Natarajan's charges have disappeared in a day!"
	Natarajan was Environment Minister in UPA II, being asked to resign 100 days before the 2014 elections were to take place. At the time, the Congress planted stories that she was being punished for delaying clearances for major economic projects and sacking her was a peace offering to big business. In her letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Natarajan charges the reports against her were planted by Rahul Gandhi's associates and aides.
	Natarajan also suggests she delayed decisions on specific projects - involving specific business houses and specific states, usually run by non-Congress governments - only when Rahul and Sonia Gandhi asked her to. Do note this does not absolve Natarajan. While she denies any charges of corruption, she does admit she set aside her professional judgement and ministerial disinterestedness to follow orders of party leaders who were not part of the government. Even if there is no financial transaction involved, is this not irregular and does it not amount to corruption in the wider sense of the term?
	The Congress has hit back by saying Natarajan was removed following accusations of corruption. However, it has not explained why these accusations were not investigated. Spokespersons have offered the lame excuse that "actionable evidence" was not available. Why was "actionable evidence" not pursued? What of Natarajan's claim that she has further evidence of "advice" offered to her by the Gandhi family? Not too many in the media are asking these questions and the Congress is getting away lightly.
	Natarajan was not a newcomer to the Congress. She represented the fourth generation in her family to have entered party politics. Her grandfather was Chief Minister of Madras state (now Tamil Nadu). She was considered close to Rajiv Gandhi and was at Sriperumbudur in May 1991 when he was so tragically assassinated. Absent a mass base or a pocked borough, her career was dependent on her perceived proximity to the Nehru-Gandhis.
	In deciding to burn her bridges with the Congress' controlling dynasty, Natarajan has in effect ended her political career. She is unlikely to be wooed by other parties because she is not really a vote-catching asset. She has left the party that was her natural home and that sheltered her. In a sense, she has committed political suicide. Why?
	There are two inter-connected reasons for this. First, when she was removed from government, Natarajan felt she was being framed for the economic decline in the dying years of the UPA. She argued policies of previous years in other ministries, including the Finance Ministry, and the actions and delays of her predecessor, Jairam Ramesh, were much more to blame. That aside, the overall philosophy of the Sonia-Rahul Congress was anything but encouraging of economic growth.
	Second, Natarajan was upset she was hung out to dry even though - by her account - she had only faithfully followed directives. She was asked to block projects related to certain businessmen and state governments when it suited Rahul and Sonia. When the mother and son wanted to appear sensitive to industry in the run-up to the election, Natarajan was deemed expendable.
	Heaven knows who did what deal, but when the Central Bureau of Investigation began looking into some of the cases, the Nehru-Gandhi family completely dumped Natarajan. She was on her own. Mrs and Master Gandhi protected their reputation. The reputation of Natarajan and her clan - which has some social standing in Chennai, even if it is politically irrelevant in contemporary Tamil Nadu - counted for nothing.
	Is Natarajan's conduct entirely above board? To be fair, it is not. Even those who sympathize with her predicament will have a hundred questions. The point is, there should be at least half as many questions for Rahul and Sonia. More important, what message does it send to Congress loyalists if they cannot trust their party leadership to stand by them simply for obeying instructions?
	In good times, a leader delivers votes. In sombre times, a leader evokes faith, gathers his troops and keeps them united. It is so different in the Congress. In the past eight months, since the defeat in the Lok Sabha election, the Congress machinery has been summoned to defend Robert Vadra's land deals, defend the creative usurpation of assets in the National Herald case, and defend the Nehru-Gandhis against Jayanthi Natarajan.
	What has Rahul done in return? Well, he's addressed one election meeting in Delhi.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Congress is going down the mountain under the (dis)able leadership of Shri Rahul Gandhi. No one should raise the voice or object. This is destiny. And I am missing the secular ideas &amp; comments  from Diggy Raja. Please say something Diggy, c'mon, don't be a party spoiler. The nation awaits your secular guidance.

                            Reason is simple. The Mian Stream English Media People received funds from Congress in abundance. That is not all Many are rewarded with Padma Bhushans and Padmashri. During Congress led UPA Regime next to Congress Leaders it was these people that were Shining.They did their level best to make Sonia-Rahul-Priyanka Heaven Born Leaders. But they failed.Even the Fire during MHa Pralayam can be caught in the Palm of the Hand.But No one can make a Leader. Leadership Qualities are inborn or they should be cultivated through Hard Work.

                            I must say, at least someone is asking questions now to Mrs Gandhi and Master Gandhi, which would have been answered 10 years ago. This can be a start!

                            That you compare Yedurappa (reddy brothers &amp; co) with this Jayanti Natarajan issue, alone shows the weakness of your argument. Her allegation is that in the name of environment, Rahul Gandhi asked her to block some projects. Nobody profited from this. But with Yedurappa, hills and forests in Karnataka were mined and sold to China by the Reddy brothers.

                            True words. Congress abdicated it's responsibility when in power by having MMS to bear the cross for all failures of Gandhis. Now its shunning all responsibility as principal opposition party. Congress has to die and a responsible opposition party needs to emerge  for democracy to thrive in India

                            At least it's nice to see that at last some of the seniors come out openly to expose the previous government at the cost of their career.  At the same time, it's sad that people like Dr Singhvi still supports the leadership.  True, Natarajan comes from an illustrious family.

                            Mr Malik your BJP is in power they can order for investigation at least they removed her not like BJP which has criminally charged people at the helm of affairs.  What worries you is why this Jayanthi Tax issue died so early because BJP does not want to pursue this issue since you cannot induct Ms Jayanthi into your party openly so there's no use of her neither you can crucify Rahul Gandhi openly because the Adhivasis were supported.<br/>
Why this crocodile tears.

                            It seems BJP has no willingness to prosecute  Con - gres party for the multiple scams done by them. Because somewhere they are afraid that if they broke the unspoken truce, one day they will also find themselves on the receiving side of it. Its a shame, but both are two sides of same coin, one is less maligned than other.
