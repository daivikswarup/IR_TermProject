Headline::::Yes, The BJP is Guilty of Minority Appeasement



DateTime::::2015-10-29T15:03:00+05:30




                                We are back to normal. A week after the BJP sounded somewhat concerned about the alienation of Muslims, it's back to its polemics. BJP President Amit Shah is calling the Dadri incident an isolated one and not the centre's problem as it happened in a state ruled by the Samajwadi Party. He also said that that BJP ministers' remarks have been misreported. Moreover, he has reverted to the traditional line that the BJP stands for all communities but is against the appeasement of minorities. And finally, the Prime Minister seems to have forgotten his support for the President's message of secularism and has raised the bogey of a Grand Alliance victory in Bihar leading to "some communities" getting a share of reservation. So vote BJP and keep reservation for OBC (Other Backward Caste) Hindus.
It is possible to take a cynical view of this and say that the BJP, facing an uphill task in Bihar, needs whatever fuel to fire support for the party in that state, as the stakes are very high: to lose Bihar would embolden the opposition, probably end any hope of a productive Parliament session next month, delaying whatever economic reforms that the government wants to introduce. However, Bihar is just one of many state elections coming up -  next year West Bengal, Assam,Tamil Nadu and Kerala go to the polls around April. So the BJP, which is keen to do well in West Bengal and feels it could capture Assam, will again feel the need to stand as the party of the Hindus, and in doing so, will it resort to fanning the flames of communalism.
And as if that were not enough, next up in 2017 is the big catch of Uttar Pradesh where the BJP swept the Lok Sabha elections and will want a repeat in the assembly elections. So can we wait patiently for the BJP's electoral compulsions to end, and ask those at the receiving end of them to ignore what is happening?
The reality is that the BJP leadership made some effort to assuage the feelings of the "secularists'' following the large-scale media coverage of Dadri, the writers' agitation and the President's call that "humanism and pluralism should not be abandoned under any circumstance". However, except for Union Minister Kalraj Mishra who comes from Uttar Pradesh and is probably aware of the rising communal tensions there - he has called for stopping this "spreading of hatred" outright - other BJP leaders have been quite mealy-mouthed in their responses. Basically, the BJP leadership took the line that the Dadri lynching was a deplorable thing that happened. That is the problem - believing or asking people to believe that these are isolated events which have no long-term impact. And that is not true.
When a reasonable, quiet and diplomatic Vice President Hamid Ansari has twice in the space of two months spoken about the concerns of the Muslims in the country, it is time to introspect. He has said "Constitution of India is like a religious book for everyone. It provides the right to live, also the government should protect this right. It is also our responsibility to protect our neighbours." And he called for interaction between the communities and warned against efforts to isolate Muslims and had said "The default by the State or its agents in terms of deprivation, exclusion and discrimination (including failure to provide security) is to be corrected by the State..."
Is it not important for the state to worry about what the Vice President is trying to communicate - that there is a disquiet in the Muslim community about what is happening in the country. Some may argue that this is paranoia but even if it were, paranoia needs to be assuaged and people told clearly that they do not face a problem and that they are not a fringe element; that the Hindutva dream does not encompass changing everyone's lifestyle to conform to the Parivar's interpretation of it. And nobody in the BJP has done that clearly and succinctly.
Instead, it has allowed a large-scale cow and beef agitation to spread. This is not some disorganized campaign by disparate Hindutva groups. It is a well thought out plan to raise the bogey of one issue that a large number of Hindus find unpalatable and propagate it with half-truths so as to convince them that the Indian sacred cow is in danger. The fact is that most states ban cow slaughter anyway, and those cows that are slaughtered are old and no longer produce milk and are of no use to farmers. Most of the farmers who sell these cows are Hindus. Moreover, most of the so-called beef in the market is buffalo meat. The beef ban is symbolic of the Hindu state: don't eat beef in India because Hindus don't eat beef.
There is absolutely no question that there has been an increased intolerance towards those who don't want to conform to idea of the Hindutva state since the general elections, and Muslims have borne much of the brunt of it. That this has not necessarily come from the BJP may be true, but the electoral victory has been seen by many on the extreme fringes of the Parivar as license to preach their brand of Hindutva. The last three incidents of lynching (Dadri, Himachal and Jammu), all over beef, are clear indications that there is A strong belief that the State will not act against such brazen behaviour. Clearly, there is the sense that the rule of law does not apply to those who are defending the "sacred cow" and other symbols of Hindutva. The Shiv Sena's and others' acts of violence against events that they believe do not conform to "cultural values of India" are just another facet of this.
The real question is does no one in the Sangh Parivar fear that they could be alienating enough numbers within the Muslim community, especially among the youth, thereby providing a veritable base for those outside the country who are keen to de-stabilize us? In other words, provide the milieu for extremism and terrorism. Have they forgotten that the demolition of the Babri Masjid led to increased support for the Students Islamic Movement of India or SIMI and turned it into a terror organization? And have they forgotten that by the early evening of December 6 1996, Mumbai was aflame?
It only needs a few hundred people who become disillusioned to provide the backbone of a terrorist organisation. But more importantly, it takes the alienation of a community to provide those few the cover and protection they need to survive. So far, the majority within the Muslim community has been able to "control'' the more militant within them. How long will this last, if the Muslims feel that they must live not as equals but, as Ansari fears, "inferior" to the rest? The Indian state is a soft state and is badly equipped to protect itself against small cell-based terrorism; with just under one in four Indians a member of the minority, India's only real protection lies in continued support of the majority of all communities of the idea of a secular country.
This is not a question of appeasement of a minority. There is no appeasement in treating people of different religions with equality, respect and justice. Instead it is important to show that the state is not appeasing that "minority'' within the Hindu community who seem to want to turn the nation back into some 5th century AD glorious Golden Age fantasy. And if there has been any appeasement of the minority, it was by the Fadnavis Government in Maharashtra that tried to impose a meat ban last month during a religious period for the Jains. Why is the BJP allowed to choose which minority to appease and which to confront?
Finally, does this government not recognize that this continued violence against minorities is not improving the image of this country abroad and probably scaring away real foreign investment? If you see the news about India that has been carried by the international press, it is not about the travels of the Prime Minister but the communal violence, lynching and rapes. Not a particularly pretty picture to draw investment.  
As Shailaja Bajpai (disclosure: my sister) wrote last week and Arun Shourie echoed the other day, the Congress was about corruption and the BJP has become about the cow.

                            It's not BJP, but it's all other so called secular parties that are guilty of minority(Muslim) appeasement. Remember it's the CPI-TMC combo in west Bengal which had introduced 10% reservations for Muslims not BJP.

                            Yes. We are back to Normal. The signs of normalcy is when the blind folded liberal so called secular brigade does selective hectoring on Hindu Right. For too long in this country, the original homeland of Hindus, Hinduism and Hindu Traditions have been accorded a second class status. Its an irony that the convent educated, de-racinated and de-culturized Hindus dont consider it necessary to protect the diverse, divided hindu community and its traditions in the country of its origin. For too long, the leftist and liberal consider it as their right to tranple upon the emotons of hindus in the name of modernity whereas treat the muslim community with kid gloves when there are glaring evidences that the practices and traditions of Islam does not fit an aspiring modern society. Infortunate as it may sound but deliberate is the strategy in glossing over the islamic fundamentalism by the "secular" brigade.<br/><br/>
Most of Hindu right has stopped listening to this secular brigade as they have lost credibility with their selective secularism. Yes, when salman rushdie speaks, there is credibility as he stood up to fanatic Islam, but not for others like the author of this article. The BJP Party is no different than any other political party when it comes to practicing communalist politics. Whether one plays the caste card or the religion card, both are communal. To consider the likes Kerala congress or Samajavadi party or RJD as the light houses of secularism and BJP as communal betrays, again the selective secularism approach. The author should decide what is his idea of secularism before hectoring the Hindu right. If he is looking for a modernistic society with individual rights as supreme over community rights, then let is stand up and forcefully talk about it. Let he standup on the slavery and complete emasculation of Muslim women in this country.

                            The only two times when secularism came under real danger were:  in 1984 (Sikhs)  and second time when Kashmiri Pandits were forcibly evicted from valley. Thousands of people were massacred with the state's involvement. <br/>
Leftist media never blamed the then PM. <br/>
Compare this to this rule under BJP, where the tragedies can be counted on fingers of one hand. A death is a death, but compare the magnitude !!!<br/>

                            You are spreading lies about Devendra Fadnavis banning beef during Jain festival. Number of times he has clarified that it is old practice since Congress days and current Maharashtra Govt. has not issued any order banning beef. Yet so called intellectuals like you keep on spreading canard. It is media and people like you have made beef an issue.<br/><br/>
Whatever incidents (Dadri, Himachal Pradesh) have happened, rule of law has been applied on all perpetrators. They have been arrested and will pay for their crimes.<br/><br/>
You people do not even talk about Hindu community in Dadri village making all arrangements in marriage of Muslim girls delayed due to unfortunate incident of lynching. Larger sections of both communities are not swayed by these isolated events. But you people won't stop fanning hatred by creating out-of-proportion bogeys.

If any one is listening BBC Hindi news -- just check the names of reporters and  the program presenters. More than 80% of these people are non- Hindus and they make it a point to show that minorities are in great danger in India.<br/>
There is huge war going on in  Middle East  between Shias and Sunnis  and people are dying like insects.<br/>
However the concentration of our media is to magnify even a small incident and show to the world as  India is burning.!! Bunch of unpatriotic jokers..!!

                            Few years back I used to think that NDTV is reasonably impartial. But following the reporting more closely, it looks to me that it is very much left/congress biased. I can see these days that a concerted effort is going on to create an idea that Indian society has become very intolerable after Modi has come to power and NDTV is certainly playing a role in it. I can see that reporting is happening in a very selective manner. For example, in ZEE news website I saw an article that Hindus could not do Durga puja in a village in West Bengal due to the pressure from Muslims. I also saw newspaper reports that in Murshidabad district of West Bengal, Hindus could not organize Sarawswati puja due to the pressure from Muslims. I did not see any debate or even any mention of such incidents. None of these so called Intellectuals will question these incidents. I wonder why? Should you not protest against these things? Are these justified? I do not expect this message will be posted. This is for NDTV itself.

Worst part is the threatening tone of article which suggests that the muslims may become terrorists and kill us all. This is the attitude of sickularists which inflames the right wing. It is not the fault of Muslims right wing and muslim terrorists who are misled by such writers. These writers show them wrong path.

                            Hindus don't marry 4 women as wives - so is banning the practice of having multiple wives "a Hindu state" ? <br/><br/>
Because that is kind of logic being applies when it comes to cow slaughter. Hindus WORSHIP the cow, not just "not eat" them. Hindus aren't asking Muslims to "worship" the cow - but to stop its slaughter as beef from the cow is neither "essential" nor "required" for the practice of Islam nor is it essential the health of any community considering all the other alternatives that are cheaper sources of protein and that are readily available. <br/><br/>
This kind of pathetic farce of trying to demean and condemn Hindus for having the temerity to stand up for their own beliefs (that are protected by law) and have people from all communities respect them as well shows the bankruptcy of the authors arguments. <br/><br/>
Hindus have every right to protect the cow, and to protest its slaughter and its consumption by ANYBODY. Though I do will concede that resorting to mob violence is not the answer - but nevertheless it is indisputable that social harmony in India is not a function of depriving Hindus and subordinating their religious sentiments for the "liberty" of others.

                            Mr Aaron... Just for your information, the percentage of muslims in west bengal is 27. That means Muslims should get a quota of 27% in both public and private sector jobs, business and education. You say that 10% reservation for muslims in west bengal itself is an appeasement which really surprises me!! Muslims have every right to get the equal amount of quota as per the ratio of their population in each and every respective state. This is not any appeasement but their birth right as the sons and daughters of the soil just like hindus. Its hindus of india who are eating the share of muslims as well in every sector. Indian Muslims are not imported from anywhwere. They are the sons of soil as any other citizens. Just because muslims do not follow Idol worship or hindu systems doesn't mean that they should be treated less than the majority and deprived of equal status and opportunities.

How cleverly, this writer has, mentioned that "Reservation for OBC (Other Backward Caste)" is only for Hindus".. which is not true.<br/>
Modi is blamed for 2002 Riots (as he was CM of Gujarat then) and nobody is blaming SP for dadri lynching...isn't it double standard?<br/><br/>

If a muslim does a crime he is seen as an indian. If a hindu does a crime he is highlighted as a crime. This was evident even in leading news papers like Hindu. 2 similar incidents in chennai 1- a hindu youth was ransacked by stopping his bike the headlines was -'IT youth, bla bla ... on his way to bla bla etc' but the same happened in a weeks time to a muslim youth. The headlines was ' a muslim youth bla bla...' <br/>
Where are we going? If this nation sees uprising of hindus against these minority appeasement then the blame will go to Congress &amp; co, media and illetrates like you.

                            Blaming just BJP for rising intolerance in the country is simplifying the matter for your own convenience. Now that the BJP is in power, every political party worth one's salt is trying to somehow derail the BJP bandwagon. So every single incidence which can be projected as oppression of muslims/dalits/christians is picked up by every opposition politician/journalists and fuel is added to the flame. <br/><br/>
People like Rahul Gandhi, Kejriwal, Mamta and Nitish who are as much responsible for the problem as much is V.K Singh, Manish Sharma, Sakshi Maharaj or Sangeet Som.<br/><br/>
Also we tend to forget that this is the age of 24 hours news. News channels like spiced up news. News which will generate more tension, political backlash and TRPs are preferred over well researched articles. <br/>
All media channels are fighting to show any controversial news items, but when time comes of accepting mistakes, don't even expect one liner from them.<br/>
We know that journalists will prefer to make video of people dying on road rather than to take them to hospital. Why shouldn't I believe that they will make India burn in order to make themselves count. Some of the popular names in media today made name for themselves live reporting riot escapees.

                            See France/England etc are seeing large scale recruitments to the ISIS although there is no Modi there...so those who want to be terrorist will be...those who don't want seek refuge ...<br/>
As far as BJP goes it has to win elections to be relevant...So do other political parties...so AAP used freebies to win never mind its consequence..Nitish cosied up with Laloo...how's that,,,how come no articles on that...Shourie wanted to be London High Commissioner ( a fact stated by Vinod Mehta Late) ,,,Modi did not even meet him ...Nayantara/Romila/Karan are all close relatives of Gen PN Thapar a close acolyte of Nehru...

                            Appeasement for muslims in ingrained in the very soul of secularists. They feel that muslims should be pandered to in order to keep India intact. I dont know if you want that kind of India where they have to be always top of the heap. Hindus are dispensable

                            It is very well said ! India belongs to all Indian citizens from any community, race ethnicity or caste. Citizens can not be discriminated based on religious or ethnic identity which is major violation of our constitution. India's secular, pluralistic, democratic and peaceful credential must be protected as any cost and those like Hindutva brigade must be discarded by majority citizens in interest of India.

                            RSS BJP made India &amp; it's people more vulnerable to terrorists attacks and communal violence than anybody else. RSS is 100% have political goals which they accomplish through BJP . Down with RSS BJP , this is a humble appeal to majority community of Our country.

                            Sirji, There is another possibility as well. Any small cell terrorist attack will end up in large scale targeting of the particular community, to the extent of their wiping out more or less. Under the given circumstances, possibility of that happening is much higher. I hope those few do not forget or remain under some kind of miscalculations.
