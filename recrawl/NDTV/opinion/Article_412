Headline::::How Modi and Amit Shah Lost Delhi For the BJP



DateTime::::2015-02-11T14:37:00+05:30




                                
	(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)
	Is this the End of the Beginning for Modi - or the Beginning of the End?
	Kiran Bedi, whose aesthetic judgement has Modi's "beautiful face" as its benchmark, might step forward to claim the credit for the BJP's spectacular defeat in the Delhi elections, but the palm leaf should surely be shared by Modi and his beautiful companion-at-arms, Amit Shah. Between the two of them, they have delivered the BJP such a sound thrashing that for exactly the same reason that till yesterday, their dual performance at the polls used to be hailed as "masterly", for that same reason, they now need to be held up to ridicule. But for the two having so needlessly taken over what, after all, was an election to India's smallest state, the BJP would certainly not have suffered the rout it has.
	 
	It was the two who decided that Kiran Bedi should be rewarded for her tasteless sycophancy by being selected to grace the Throne of Delhi. In a single stroke, they antagonized dozens of Delhi's homegrown BJP leaders and thousands of its workers. Here is a party that in the two decades since Delhi was granted statehood has produced a sheaf of Chief Ministers ranging from Madan Lal Khurana to Sahib Singh and Sushma Swaraj. Their leaders have included men of political standing like Vijay Kumar Malhotra, Harshvardhan and Jagdish Mukhi. All of them, and scores of other aspirants, were pushed to one side by a single decree emanating from the very top of the party: the crown, they ordered, is being awarded to Kiran Bedi. The precipitate decline in the BJP's fortunes coincided exactly with that decision. Till then, pollsters had thought the BJP would carry the people of Delhi with it. In fact, Modi and Shah between them ensured that Kejriwal's jhadoo would sweep the elections.
	 
	The next mistake of the Modi-Shah duo was converting a small state election into a referendum on the Centre's performance by inducting into the campaign every single central minister and no less than 120 MPs, besides its Chief Ministers and other senior leaders from the Hindi belt. Never - and this is worth emphasizing - never have so many been deployed to achieve so little. Modi-Shah wanted to claim victory in Delhi as vindication of nine months of BJP rule at the Centre. In the event, the elections have only exposed the growing disillusionment and disenchantment of the people of India with the empty bombast that has characterized those nine months of insubstantial image boosting.
	 
	A third major boo-boo was the Modi-Shah decision to delay the elections in Delhi from the summer last year to the present. Had they recognized the temporary nature of the wave that took Modi to power, they would have understood that the wave had crested and the ebb had started. But so puffed up were they with their arrogance and certitude that they failed to see that every wave must ebb. Hubris has arrived. As the ancient Greeks used to say, "Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad!"
	 
	That there is such a syndrome operating is best illustrated by Modi-Shah's refusal to take a stand on communal disturbances. Both Trilokpuri and Bawana in NCT Delhi have been buffeted by communal riots in the aftermath of the May 2014 elections. That disturbs the aam admi and the khaas aadmi. But neither Modi nor Shah has had a word to say in sympathy for the victims. Notwithstanding the ten-year moratorium on communalism that Modi sought fit to declare from the ramparts of the Red Fort, again and again he has failed to rein in the lunatic fringe of the Sangh Parivar - for the good reason that it is this fringe which brought him to power and it is this fringe that is his natural home. The so-called "development agenda" has long been put on the back-burner while the real agenda is brought to the fore through "love jihad", "ghar wapasi" and forced conversion/reconversion, aside from pre-election riots of the kind the nation witnessed at Saharanpur. Five churches have been attacked or burned down in Delhi itself. Not a word about this outrage figured in the Modi-Shah campaign. It alienated every segment of the voting public.
	 
	There is also the notorious praise of the "patriotism" of the murderer of the Mahatma, Nathuram Godse, and the building of temples to him and statues of him. Modi's response was to refuse to fulfill his parliamentary duty of coming to the Rajya Sabha to explain himself, thus sabotaging his government's entire legislative agenda. He did it because he and Jaitley had already hatched their dirty plan of bringing through ordinances legislation that would not have stood the scrutiny of Parliament.
	 
	One of these ordinances relates to the Land Acquisition Act that the BJP had voted for only a few months ago. By taking away from the aam admi the right to not lose land without his consent and due compensation, the BJP has alarmed small and marginal landholders the country over. The first test was on the rural and quasi-rural outskirts of Delhi that have been the worst victims of the real estate mafia. It was in the score of seats in this rural periphery that the BJP won most of its seats in the December 2013 elections. It is here that the BJP has now been roundly defeated. The implications are nation-wide: that Nariman Point and Malabar Hill may thrill at the thought of land being acquired at a pittance by the State for exploitation by Big Business, but the farmers and the labour that works these lands are going to reject the BJP all over the countryside if it persists, as it seems likely to do, with the amendments it has made by ordinance to the Land Acquisition Act.
	 
	The ordinances reflect, of course, the authoritarian bent of mind that is so characteristically Modi's (and Shah's). They got away with it in Gujarat. So, they thought they could get away with it at the Centre. Delhi has taught them a lesson -  namely, that democracy does not care for dictators. The deft playing of the communal card in Gujarat gave them ten years of arbitrary abuse of power in the name of "development" in that State; Delhi, in keeping with India's civilizational ethos, has not only said a big NO to creeping communalism, it has also said No to the undermining of democracy and democratic practice.
	 
	But perhaps Modi's biggest contribution to his own resounding defeat has been the ten lakh suit, embroidered repeatedly with his name, that he donned to show off to Obama. That is manic vanity. People were revolted at the idea of their Prime Minister dressing up like a mediaeval monarch. Remember the story of the child who cried out that the Emperor had no clothes? Delhi has asked the same question.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mani - You need to set your house in order before pointing faults at others. Being a Congress supporter it is nauseating to see people like you and the leadership in general waiting for others to make mistakes to become relevant again. Sorry, that wont work. You better change or AAP is going to be the new Congress for me.

                            Dear Mr. Iyer,<br/><br/>
You are one of the few congress leaders that I actually admire and find intelligent.<br/><br/>
While some of your observations on BJP appear more of a ridicule than actual analysis, still you have raised some genuine points as well. <br/><br/>
What I truly fail to understand is that what happens to this intellect within the Congress Party. I am sure that you, and most leaders within the Congress, know the actual reason why congress is getting decimated in every elections in the past year or so. Why can't people like you speak up within Congress forums and accept that you are doing so bad primarily because of the rampant corruption, both yours as well as you allies. Why can't you say that Gandhis (be it Rahul, Sonia or Priyanka) do not and can not connect with common man, and must therefore move aside and let someone else take over. (Even you would make a much better candidate in my view).<br/><br/>
As a Congress supporter (though I don't vote for congress any longer)I urge you to speak up within the party and at least begin some process of revival. If things continue to go the way they are, I am afraid it will only get even worse from Congress from here on.

                            BJP would analyze there defeat and take corrective steps in coming election. But what about Congress - why you are not analyzing Congress's zero seat &amp; only 8% vote share (at least BJP retained its vote share if not seats)? What advice are you giving to RG &amp; SG? <br/><br/>
The way Congress is loosing its vote share in all states, no wonder, before 2020, if it can loose its national level party status to state level party..!

                            Instead of writing an obituary note of his party, Mani is deriving vicarious and sadistic  pleasure from the defeat of BJP in Delhi.The truth is BJP received 27 lakh  (one lakh more) votes than 2013 election (26 lakhs). The defeat is mainly due to transfer of congress and BSP votes (13% + 4%) to AAP. the BJP support base is intact with 32% vote share, compared to 9% of INC.Demise of BSP also contributed to stunning victory of AAP. Winning 67 seats out of 70 is no doubt outstanding, but places onerous responsibility on AAP to perform.Some of the promises made by AAP  are difficult to fulfill. No excuses will work.Peoples' expectations have risen sky high, and it will not take much time for the AAP's graph to head south.

This why congress has gone and had no respect in people. Mr. Mani please introspect your party why it got zero before put any comment on other.And I hope BJP to learn same otherwise it will be at par with congress.

                            There is nothing new in this article then what has already been said by scores of other analysts political pundits and their Uncles. Mr. Iyer, if you really want to remain relevant on the blog scene - an original would have been an analysis of why Congress got zero seats in Delhi and how you and others with their single minded sycophantic behaviour towards Master Rahul have ruined the Congress Party and reduced it to its most miserable state.

                            Ofcourse! BJP did a lot of mistakes! But at least many leaders of BJP accept the fact that their house is not in order and they didn't read the mood of people properly and the need for introspection. At least they realize that they've done things wrong or wrong things! <br/><br/>
On the other hand, Mani's party didn't realize their mistakes and ended up saying "We didn't communicate out achievements properly to voters". Mr. Mani Shankar Iyer, Have you ever blogged, about why Congress lost? or At least, Why did you lose the election?

If people rejected BJP's agenda then the same people has rejected your family rule accept that fact also.

                            This is exactly what has hit BJP.  Ravishanker Prasad said yesterday what is more disturbing is that we could not read mood of people of delhi. he must know when you bulldoze from top and bring outsiders over your own cadre , they will silently revolt ; may give you wrong feedback/picture to teach the top brass a lesson. This is what has happened. <br/>
PM is slogan master , he loves company of Ambani brothers , adani ,etc super riches of India but have dubious track record. He talks of Gandhi ,Patel ; says he is messiah of the poor but changes 4 suits is a day, designer kurta /pyjama every day different one ....this depicts his real side of personality. <br/>
this is what has been the revelation to people of the country in last 8 months..<br/>
As time will pass , real picture will stay more n more with wise people of this country...and then more corrections will come in political space.

                            Nice commentary!  However you failed to mention how AK will govern Delhi.  I fear power companies shutting down and running away for want of proper price, water utilities going bankrupt &amp; general chaos &amp; mayhem that will land in Delhi's lap. We know expectation out of TMC &amp; reality, from Congress &amp; reality!!.

                            "five churches have been attacked or burned down in Delhi" .... ...even after that also congress not won single seat..and 67 candidate lost deposit....vote share of 24% went down to 9%....so burning the church certainly effected congress party badly ..so communal agenda failed again ..

                            You have always been biased with your opinions. Thisone is no different.. Instead of thinking of BJP's loss, wouldnt it be prudent for you to remember that Congress performance is much worse. Pls also remember the route you faced recently in Maharashtra,. Haryana too. You have also commented about modi and amit shah taking blame for the delhi defeat, You ought to 1st answer on why havent your party leaders like Sonia gandhi and Rahul gandhi taken blame for defeat after defeat??

                            Mr. Aiyar, Modi at least has a question "beginning of end OR end of beginning" in front of him. What about you sir? What about Congress? And now after loss and decimation in both national and Delhi, including other 4 state elections, is it the "end of end" for Rahul Baba / Sonia G and sycophants like you???<br/><br/>
PS: Even after being so (called) learned, why do you have such a foul tongue?

                            Modi and Shah will learn from this defeat,acept their mistakes,make amends for them and change their attitude and strategy towards governance and election campaigns.<br/>
They rebound with a triumph in Bihar.Mr Aiyer's point about the expensive suit is rather futile.He was welcoming the President of USA and Modi was representing a resurgent and successful India and dressed sensibly.Indians are a proud people and we expect our PM to be proudly attired.<br/>
I am sure PM Modi will read and heed to Mr Aiyer's criticism just as he listened to the derogatory chaiwala remark that the author made which Mr Modi availed as a great opportunity to establish and enhance his struggle through an impoverished but hard working background that the whole of the country identified and empathised with.<br/>
Mr Aiyer's timely reminder should be used to wrest dominance of BJP with a more confident mindset but a diffident approach to mitigate attitude or arrogance.Back to it's winning ways again will be the BJP.

                            At long last this rather limited man has something to say. I am a staunch BJP supporter and find his critique justified. <br/>
The BJP should clearly clearly introspect and self correct before they lose more competitive ground to AAP - which is eminently suited to run municipalties and civic affairs . It is extremely important for the ethos and identity of our country that BJP remains in power for 2 decades at least. However cultural and identity renaissance needs people of high sensitivity and caliber.

                            Mani, pls note that there is no change in the BJP vote share (33%) in 2013 and 2014 elections. What happened was Congress vote share was reduced from 25% to 9%. The 16% vote share of congress considered as Anti-BJP and galvanized with AAP (29% in 2013 + 16% = 45%)which is good enough for a landslide victory. Mani, what u have to do is how congress still got 9% instead of 0%. may be RaGa?

                            This article calls Modi dictator, arrogant, and so many other names. Though BJP managed to retain almost the same percentage of last assembly polls, they lost due to 1) the propaganda by AAP about free water, cheap electricity (that too when Delhites are paying much less than other metros like Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore) and 2) the motormouths, the lunatic fringe of the Sangh Parivar making all kinds of statements (3) the minorities voting en-block for AAP You don't have to be overly critical of Modi and blame him for everything. The author was the same person who made fun of Modi, offering him a stall to sell tea at an AICC venue. Why do you carry such articles from a rabid Modi haiter?

The younger generation is not interested in communal politics and are not going to accept status quo or pure vanity but rather want sincere results.

                            Well done Mani, you and many others have earned the right to gloat over an arrogant BJP, for their resounding defeat!!!

                            Can you write about "How Rahul Betta Lost Delhi For the Congress"?

                            Look who is talking about vanity?! None other than Mani, whose supremely arrogant 'chaiwala' jibe about Modi has made congress pay dearly in the general elections and thereafter! He calls Modi's donning of a 10-lakh suit as 'manic vanity', so what was your comment about Modi then, Mr Iyer?<br/><br/>
Also, Mr Iyer, not a word about the grand congress performance? How come? It was truly exceptional wasn't it, surely not business-as-usual stuff, or was it so for your party?<br/><br/>
If you have any sense of humility or proportion left, Mr Mani Iyer, and I seriously doubt that, you'll do well to write a couple of pages dissecting the congress misery and how it came about. Let's see you do that, Mr Iyer.
