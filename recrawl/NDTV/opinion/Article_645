Headline::::AAP's Search for a Panacea is No Substitute for Governance



DateTime::::2015-06-05T04:16:00+05:30




                                Since time immemorial, men and women have endeavoured to create a one-shot magic solution for all difficulties. Children across cultures have grown up on bedtime stories of great magicians and fairy queens with magic wands capable of granting every wish. Others have searched for the elusive panacea to cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely. In the middle ages, alchemists sought to create the mythical philosopher's stone to transmute iron into gold.
 
The citizens of Delhi, strangely, are living through similar times. They wholeheartedly elected a political party on a promise to deliver a magnificent agenda of development and governance. Within its first four months in office, however, Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party government, rather than delivering governance, seems more interested in inventing an original brand of political alchemy.
 
Arvind Kejriwal's AAP is in war mode, ostensibly in a fight to punish the corrupt. And in an abiding conspiracy theory, the AAP leadership seems to believe that everyone beyond their fold is seeking to prevent them from fighting corruption. This single line of defence is their justification while leveling wild allegations against all who question the legitimacy of their authority. This includes the Union Government, officers from the permanent executive, the media and even the judiciary. Through shrill cacophony, they attempt to drown the voice of reason and constitutionality.
 
The latest bone of contention is how the AAP government wants to use the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) of Delhi. Initial media reports exposed plans to purchase snooping and surveillance equipment for the ACB. This raised serious concerns over privacy and whether misuse could result in targeting the Union Government of India, the Parliament, Supreme Court, Election Commission or even embassies of various countries.
Thereafter, another attempt followed to bolster the ACB. The media reported that the Delhi government had sought the services of police officers on "loan" from various non-BJP ruled states. Some from Bihar are alleged to have joined or withdrawn consent for such a posting.
 
The crux of the problem is rooted in the nature of Delhi as defined in the Constitution of India. It is a Union Territory with a legislative house. Since Delhi is not a state and is instead a Union Territory, the elected government in Delhi doesn't have powers in certain areas, which includes the police. The Delhi Police, under law, reports to the Union Home Ministry.
 
Nowhere has AAP answered a fundamental question - if police is not a subject under their authority, how can raising a police force be constitutionally correct? Additionally, why is it that the AAP persistently picks on issues that lie beyond its purview, instead of concentrating on the powers it does have? These include health, sanitation, education, transport, and policy formulation among several others.
 
The fight against corruption begins by enacting systems and procedures that prevent corruption at the start of the process of interface between citizens and government agencies. This lies in the domain of legislation and governance. The Delhi Government can decide to improve systems, through checks and balances, to prevent corruption in numerous bodies that deal with citizens on a daily basis. They can legitimately transfer officers in these departments, if they wish, to check and prevent corruption.
 
Yet they do not do so, displaying scant inclination in this direction. What they desire, it seems, is to pick on contentious issues and create a splash, rather than  seriously resolve to implement their manifesto promises. In an attempt to accumulate further power and attention, they distract themselves from earnestly addressing and discharging authority in areas of governance where they can make a difference.
 
A government at war with everyone is hardly a government that can serve the interests of its citizens. AAP apparently wishes to wipe everything away. It mistrusts everyone, in an attempt to recreate and re-invent the wheel. Their search for a political panacea is far from practical or appropriate.
The legislature, executive, judiciary and media, each has a specific role to perform. Each, in their lot, has honest men and women committed to their task. Attacking them, unreasonably, is hardly an appeal for either cooperation or an attempt at political maturity. By seeking officers from other state services, they disillusion earnest officers within the system. AAP might therefore do well, at this point, to recall and reflect on MK Gandhi's words - "the end is inherent in the means."(Nalin S Kohli is spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Director of the party's Public Policy Research Centre.

                            Instead saying Bla Bla, keep that promise - statehood to Delhi - your party has been giving to Delhi People for more than 15 years, at least now when your are in a position to implement it being in power at Center with full majority. If not you and your party are treated as Betrayers of people. Now regarding ACB, even a child knows Corruption is the biggest menace of this country and Delhi is the capital of it. When a CM wants to fight that big menace with a good team instated of supporting wholeheartedly, you are finding fault under some technicalities. What kind of Acha Din you can give to people of Delhi? If this is not mean-mindedness what else it could be called? Remember people are watching these Drama you play through a proxy called Jung and with this write up you overtly taken responsibility to it.

                            Mr. Kohli, Just no content in your writing. <br/><br/>
1. Delhi people elected based on AAP's promises, so did Indian people on BJP's promises. If AAP's failed and missed on few. So has BJP.  If at all what is proven is with all the authority and machinery under the central government, you cannot keep up her promises, AAP is justified in missing a few, with literally no authority. particularly after your LG fiasco !. <br/><br/>
2. If AAP buys equipment then it is a security and privacy concern. But them in Gujarat the police snoops using all its equipment and man power just one girl , that too on a complain of her father, then what do we call it ? <br/><br/>
3. If AAP speaks about media or others, its unreasonable. But If the PM says media "bekaho", then it is truth. If PM says 5 star NGOs then it is truth. Are there not 100s of honest NGOs who serve the people much better than your party ? <br/><br/>
4. Who are we to say how the Delhi government has to work against corruption? Are you elected by Delhi people? They let us wait outside and watch. <br/><br/>
5. 67% people voted AAP in Delhi. As against only 31% for BJP (395 including allies) nationally.. Please note 60% Indians did not want BJP and only 33 % did not want AAP in delhi !. <br/><br/>
AAP has the mandate and let them do, what the want.

                            The fact of the matter is BJP still not able to recover from Delhi defeat and thereafter. Central Govt though goes on full blown trumpet to list their achievements but so called "Ache Din" is far from common men's reach. Hence they are back to their opposition genes. Well that's expected. <br/><br/>
It's hard to digest that a new party of an year old standing can claim delhi govt twice in a year's time but BJP took decade to get into driver seat. I think this shameless rhetoric will continue, as this is the only job that BJP leaders can do at their best.

                            Anybody who analyses events should have realised by now, that AAP is based on maximum impact based on empty rhetoric. They were going to lock up Sheila Dixit forever, first time round with Kejri's 500 pages of evidence. That died. The idea of Lok Pal has also been killed off by AAP. Free water? forget it;there is NO Water. Power - 50% off. They know they cannot deliver, so that too is been buried quietly. 15 lakh cameras? A distant dream now, a blatant lie. The first time round AAP arrested couple of lowly constables for taking a bribe, but then they were let go. This time they claim they have 35 officers in custody, but no names offered up so far! Whatever happened to school places? Free wi-fi? Whatever happened to AAP? Good politics is about hard work , understanding issues and solving problems - NOT about self publicity.

                            I think BJP other parties paid media treat Corruption as one of the issues. But the fact of the matter is corruption is the root cause of most of the issues. If there is no corruption in Road contracts you would get better road. If the money spent on schools and colleges actully reach the benificiries then you would get better education. You will have teachers selected on merit not by bribry. If there is no corruption you will get better government hospitals. Goverment spending in health and education is at par with private hospitals and school still the qulity is bad why ? Someone is looting the public money... Higher inflation can be attributed to corruption ... So if a govenment is serious about it why BJP / Paid media / Other parties are getting a stomache ... Mr Kohli you are misleading here ...

                            AAP want to use the power of punishment to get work done. They do not have any other idea about governance. There are three other tools as mentioned in Pancha Tantra to get work done. Power of punishment is to be used last and with care. <br/><br/>
Preventing corruption by policy is a good idea but looks beyond the capability of AAP. Lets see what happens in the next four years.<br/><br/>
I saw some comments which talked about BJP promise of full statehood to Delhi. It was an election promise when BJP contested Delhi election. BJP lost that election. It means it does not have any obligation to fulfill that promise. People of Delhi should not be asking BJP to fulfill its election promise after rejecting them in election. It is totally absurd. They should ask AAP to fulfill its promises instead.

  AAP is doing way better on their promises but I saw BJP not doing anything on most of their promises they made to come into power. Delhi gave them all MP seats where BJP promises to give Delhi state status. But now they are opposing anything that give some power to Delhi Govt. please change your stance otherwise BJP will be on receiving end. Delhi has already shown it.

                            Nalin Kohli and others who are well meaning are wasting their time by trying to analyse the working of AAP.  AAP has no strategy, has no ability, has no experience, has no history and has no foresight.  It came into being as this 'macho' party that will take on anybody, and, in their own way, they have.  However, taking on Shakuntala Gamalin, who is nobody's enemy and indeed is a dedicated, impartial civil servant, is not an exhibition of machismo.  It is, on the contrary, cowardice at its basest.  Making wild allegations and then scooting is the norm for these characters.  With complete fraudsters like Tomar and Bharti in the A team, combined with a 'here today, gone tomorrow' Kumar Vishwas, a whole bunch of unsavoury characters have taken over the capital city of India.  They will not be able to deliver on the promises made to the slum dwellers and come the next election, will blame everybody but themselves for the lack of governance and administration.  Bringing in officials from other 'non-BJP' states is a deliberate policy to project Kejriwal as a national leader able to unite the forces that are opposed to the BJP.  It would seem that the Bihari slum dwellers of Delhi on whose votes Kejriwal largely relied, have effectively taken over our capital city.  That would be fine if these slum dwellers were contributing towards the welfare of India.  They are not; they are, instead a drain on society.  Now, with the proposed secondment of police officials from Bihar, that state, which is the most backward in India, is taking over India through the back door exactly like the British did in the 18th century.

                            Delhi in all its might is the seat of the central govt and it must not be a state for security measures. The problem with AAP is the question of gaining significance in the current milieu, and putting back the shameful episode of internal fighting and bickering. Using taxpayers money to subsidize electricity and water for the poor is good, but the sights must be set on long term, if Kejri ends up with a negative bank balance, he will only start crying again about BJP not giving enough money. Insulting bureaucrats knowing well that they cannot defend themselves openly and constitutionally is a very cheap thing to do indeed.

                            Mr. Anarchist Kejriwal you should know that a last bencher, failure does not compare himself to the brightest scorer in the field. First prove atleast in the least measure that you have some iota of governing understanding and have shame on your antics as the CM of the UT Delhi. It's not acceptable to the people anymore, it got you upto here, NOW start working in earnest as the person asked to be at the beck and call of the delhi people or have your Jigra to be kicked out again.

                            Mr. Kejriwal should leave Delhi (that's no problem for him anyways) and fight the Bihar elections. Bihar already has a full statehood which he so earnestly requires to govern a place, he is comfortable working with the Bihar state employees, they have their own P..O..L..I..C..E Force:-), which Kejriwal is quite on the same page with as proven by his recent actions. He has no qualms about quitting after any number of days, so let's take 149 this time - afterall he is having a hard time handling the Union Territory of Delhi. And the best of all he will have ample opportunity to work on his anti corruption agenda in Bihar.

                            @: Kejriwal has to work and perform before he starts comparing himself to Modi, who has proved himself in Gujraat for 14 years. Congress tried their best to stop him but failed. there is no shortcut and Kejriwal should give up dreaming of being PM just by dramas everyday. first AAP should bring Delhi to the level of Gujraat and then we will see if He is fit to be a PM. I think Delhites like to see Drama everyday, and they are just enjoying this drama without any serious expectations. There is no comparison between Modi, The PM and Keju The CM.

                            I wonder why the ruling party at the centre is so concerned about the happenings in Delhi &amp; has to all the time intervene through the MHA by directing controls in favour of the Governor. Why is it not allowing access to straight governance by the govt elected by such a huge mandate, why doesn;t it concentrate on the whole of the country, there are many serious issues which needs immediate attention by the central govt, the NDA govt might have scored some brownie points over the past year but here is no peoples connect with middle &amp; underprivileged class of people struggling with their livelihood &amp; the issues prevailing during the UPA govt still continue to persist, Let the govt take punitive steps to make peoples life a little more comfortable

I want to ask you, have ever asked yourself what promise your party has been making over last 15 year to people of Delhi? The promise is "Full statehood". Now you call delhi is municipality, not allowing AK to get full statehood and cornering him..downsizing his functional areas. Are you not feel shame that your party betrayed/back stabbed the people of Delhi. You&amp;Your party are sadist, you pay price for every sin.

                            Policy, Politics are probably something where nothing is constant and needs to be changed time to time for public good. If a party with fresh blood like AAP wants to do something good for the citizens, let them focus on things which will help to curb the larger issues they wanted to address such as corruption, environment, politicization, etc. Please don't end up becoming part of the crowd and please don not get into politicization for everything to remain in media. If not public, at least think about your own survival in the long run. AK, please grow up and act like the one you were projected as.

                            Mr. Kohli. Whatever your stand in public may be. Do keep in mind that AK won 67/70 within the year that you had won 7/7. It must concern you how quickly your party had lost the confidence of a majority of the electorate of Delhi. Learn from the past. That's the only way of not repeating the errors that lost your party Delhi. Let AK govern if you have the courage to do so. If, as you claim, he has no experience and ability and is doomed to fail and that can only be to your advantage. If, however, you do not give him the freedom to attempt to govern your party will be condemned as lacking the courage to accept the decision of the people of Delhi and will be doomed to repeat the disastrous consequences when the MCD goes to the polls. I don't think your party is so cowardly that they will not accept the results of the elections that happened in Delhi.

                            Exactly as was predicted and chest thumpingly accepted, Kejriwal is an Anarchist who had Zero interest in governing and improving the daily lives of the people of Delhi, he is only interested in creating Chaos whether from outside the government or very shamefully as a part of the government. He had brought loathing and shame on the people of Delhi just as congress had done to Indians all these years. No doubt the people of Delhi have realized their mistake, are ashamed of electing him and will pretty soon give him a befitting reply for what he had done to them and continues to do so every minute he occupies the constitutional (which he does not respect) chair.

I put it the other way, if AAP is not matured enough BJP should come forward to teach those good lessons and not try to blow the things accusing AAP for initiating any action. Kohli should recall the past of BJP - simple question what BJP did in past is well known to one and all. Let us forget do's and donot's and try to uplift the life of citizens not only Delhi but in all states whether it is governed by BJP or any other party.

                            Statehood or No Statehood, people's lives cannot shut down, it will move step after step every moment and the chosen government has to work irrespective of the status, if it's a Union Territory that has elected you, then that is what you have to govern within the confines defined by the constitution of India. It's NOT your choice to put people's lives on a hold, if you have the capability to rule the Union Territory, please proceed and do so, if you lack the capability, then please step out of our way.

                            Jitendra Gupta, very right, next time the people doing the REAL Great work will get not just 3 Seats but 70 seats. People want those who are doing a genuine great work rather than idiots just bragging about doing any work at all. After seeing the Nautanki queen (bring the goonghat back, just the bangles are missing) we want real people to lead Delhi, Not damn shikhandi's and chowkidar's.

                            Kohliji Just two points. First how can you expect AAP Govt to curb corruption when you are not allowing ACB to function? You don't depute people from Delhi Police to ACB; nor do you allow them to borrow from other states. Your Government went all the way from lower court to SC to obtain bail for a constable who was arrested for taking bribes by ACB. It is you, not Kejriwal, who is making Delhi battle a turf war. Why don't you give to your Government these suggestions, which you are giving to the AAP Government, to check corruption in DDA, Police and other agencies under Central Government in Delhi?<br/><br/>
Secondly, it was Modi only who presented himself as panacea for all ills of India one year back. Realization has come to haunt you and Modi a bit too soon.

                            Why we do not by-cot such opinion writers ( include mr aiyyar). Such people do not see things from public eye, they see it from their agenda perspective.<br/>
IN fact Media must ensure that what is written in personal capacity as opinion must not be published.
