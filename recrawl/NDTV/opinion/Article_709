Headline::::Are We Hanging Yakub Memon In Lieu of Tiger?



DateTime::::2015-07-16T19:44:00+05:30




                                It was the calmness with which it happened that took everyone's breath away at the trial court at Arthur Road Jail. The year was 1994. Yakub Memon, accompanied by his wife Raheen, walked into court carrying a baby girl. Not even the policemen knew who they were. There was a quiet dignity about the couple, and it was a while before the court settled down, and all of us realised this was a much-wanted man who had finally been located.  
Yakub Memon claimed in court that he surrendered in July, 1994 to the police in Nepal, over a year after the serial blasts in Mumbai, to clear his name. There are many conflicting versions of just how he returned to India, having left with some of his family members two days before the terror attack.
There were some reports that he was caught in Kathmandu, where he had travelled from Karachi to consult with a lawyer. The police says he was arrested at the New Delhi railway station on August 5, 1994. And when he walked into the TADA court for the first time one month later, he expected to be able to prove that he was innocent and that he had returned to India to help with the investigation.
With the Supreme Court dismissing his last legal option on Tuesday, Memon, who has spent 21 years in jail, is to hang on July 30. Eight days to go.
A year after the serial blasts on March 12, 1993 killed 257 people and injured nearly 700 others, a designated court under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) was hearing the case on a daily basis at Arthur Road Jail. There were over 100 under-trials in prison, and they couldn't be transported to the sessions court everyday. As a result, the high-security precincts of the jail in South Mumbai became the stage for a trial that was to end over a decade later; the families of those who died have often said the long, laborious trial added to the agony of their incredible losses.
Every morning, reporters covering the trial would land up early and present their identity cards for entry. Special passes were issued much later. You had to cross the police barricade and walk past jail barracks before you climbed up a narrow flight of stairs to the makeshift court. Those on trial would be standing around sometimes, smoking, and we would often chat with them. The proceedings went by without any major news break for a while. After the morning sessions, most of us would leave since the afternoons rarely yielded any copy. 
And so, when some members of the Memon family were brought to court in August 1994, few from the media were present. The next morning, a bigger surprise was in store with Yakub being produced, along with wife and child. No one had expected any of the Memons to be caught and presented in person at the TADA court. 
Yakub's defense was that he surrendered to clear his name, and that he also brought with him evidence of Pakistan's involvement in the blasts, much to the delight of the Indian government. He said he had been holed up in a safe house in Karachi and wanted to leave.
 But "Memon" had become synonymous with the blasts - his brother, Tiger, the mastermind along with Dawood Ibrahim, was missing by now - and as Yakub would soon find out, no one bought his story - that he was innocent of planning for the serial blasts. The prosecution said he had not surrendered, discrediting his claim of wanting to help piece together how the terror attack was executed. 
Before the blasts, Yakub was a successful chartered accountant and ran a firm in partnership with a friend. It was the money he made from his businesses, including exporting meat, that financed the flats in Al Hussaini building in Mahim, where the Memons lived, quite close to the local police station.  
Yakub was charged with arranging for young men to go to Pakistan for training, hawala transactions which financed the blasts, and handing over arms and ammunition that would be used in the 12 different explosions at Mumbai landmarks.
Yakub told the court that his relatives and he left the country before the blasts on a vacation for Eid. The court didn't believe Yakub's story, or that he didn't get along with his brother, Tiger.
The judge relied on confessions, some retracted, of his co-accused, and circumstantial evidence to convict him. 
When he was given the death sentence in July 2007 by the TADA court, his younger brothers, Essa, who had a brain tumour, and Yusuf, who suffers from schizophrenia, were given life sentences since they were both ill. His sister-in-law Rubeena, whose van was found with explosives at Worli on the day of the blasts, was also given a life sentence. Usually a quiet man who keenly followed the developments in court, Yakub said this out loud when he heard his sentence - "Oh! My Lord. Forgive this man, he knows not what he does." Then he rushed out of court, muttering that he forgave the judge. 
Later, he said in court famously that he had ignored his brother Tiger's advice to refrain from pulling a "Mahatma Gandhi". Tiger, he said, warned him not to risk returning to India.
The Supreme Court, while upholding the death sentence in his case in 2013, called him one of the "driving spirits" of the 1993 blasts. His father, Abdul Razzak Memon, who was originally called "Tiger", passed away during the trial. One brother, Suleiman, was acquitted along with Yakub's wife, Raheen, and his mother Hanifa. Tiger and his brother Ayub remain in Pakistan, evading trial along with Dawood Ibrahim and several others. 
In keeping with his desire to study, Yakub completed his MA in English literature in 2013 while in jail, and is famous in the Nagpur prison as a voracious reader. 
His lawyer once said even if he is not completely innocent, he may have done nothing to warrant a death penalty. While the evidence in this regard may be debatable, there are enough who point out that Yakub Memon has paid the price for coming back for whatever reason while his brother evades the law. (Meena Menon is a journalist since 1984 and was deputy editor, The Hindu.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            What is delivered is a "judgment" and not a mathematical calculation. A judgment would always be subject to some debate and that is why we have the judiciary to pass judgments and not a computer programme.  The courts have heard him and judgment passed. End of the story.

                            If there were no evidence or even sketchy evidence, he wouldn't have received a death sentence. The bar of beyond reasonable doubt is pretty high. The writer does not provide any legal argument, while commenting on a legal case and questioning a legal judgement validated by the highest courts in the land. Anyone who is complicit in such a crime against humanity deserves no less. Don't forget this is the worst act of terrorism in the history of the nation. It's also a conspiracy of a massive scale that required elaborate planning and logistics for months. As such, it's not an act committed in the heat of the moment. Nobody deserves any mercy for conspiring to take so many innocent lives and causing irreparable damage to the city, the nation, and the very community you claim to protect.

                            Meena Menon has weaved a poignant scenario of an 'innocent' man caught in the web of his brother's criminality and replicating the last words of Jesus before his crucifixion  I hope her effort to exculpate the convicted accused is understood by the families of the innocent citizens who lost their lives (some after suffering horrendously for their injuries for days) and those who survived with shattered bodies and minds, who in the world-view of Meena and her ilk deserved their fate, and perhaps the perpetrators were sent by God to punish them for transgressions agains humanity.  I can only paraphrase her version of Yakub Memon's alleged words (while wondering who heard / recorded them for Meena): "Forgive this scribe, swhe knows not what she does".

                            Meena Menon should realise that (a) this entire process has taken well over two decades and does she mean the trial was not done in a proper manner (b) All of them were joinltly and severally responsible for this ghastly crime against humanity; (c) in fact the trial must be reopened to ensure some of them, due to their celibrity status and moneyh power got away leniently' (d) we are coneniently forgetting the sufferings of those innocent people still unable to recover, those bread earners of their familites who lost their lives for no fault of theirs. Strictest of the strictest punishment is a must and a deterrant for any future attempts to think of such atrocities.

                            The whole argument of sympathizers is wrong. Yakub memon didn't surrender , he was brought from Nepal against his will. It was his family which was persuaded to come to India and face the law. So the first argument is shattered. Another argument is that this man was not the main conspirator and main ones are in Pakistan. This argument too is fallacious. Court has convicted Yakub as the main conspirator. THose making argument for just sake of remain in discussion and limelight , please spare such serious matters.And those politicians who bring religion into this matter are the worst culprit.

Had he been involved in this horrendous crime - why would he return to India? He cooperated with our intelligence agencies and gave them all the inputs about his brother and dawood. Yakub has forgiven the Indians.

                            Remember there will always be writers on either side. Menon falls on the other side. In India justice is done late but may not be imperfect. Yakub knew he can only live in India peacefully with family but underestimated Indian judicial system. He got what he deserves in the end. The crime done by his brother is neither less nor more since both of their objective was same.

                            Please do read the judgment of the Supreme Court before making any judgments of your own. I agree with the author, sentence of death is excessive. To send a man to the gallows on a co-accused' confession is bit too risky. This was a case where sentiments got to the judges. If accused are going to be sent to the gallows because of the sentiments of the people, then judiciary is failing in its purpose.

Simply because they were involved in a crime that killed many people, but the sponsors happened to be Muslims.  INDIA IS A HIGHLY SECULAR COUNTRY.  Didn't you know that?  Christians and Muslims can do anything they want, be it conversions, float communal parties , or involve in  terrorist activities.  But that doesn't matter as INDIA IS A HIGHLY SECULAR COUNTRY.  But when Hindus engage in re-conversion, supports RSS, or engage in tit-for-tat activities, it matters.  US president talks about it, media goes to town about it.  Why?  Simply because INDIA IS A HIGHLY SECULAR COUNTRY.  Let us hope and pray for the day India decides to stop putting RELIGION &amp; CASTE  in birth certificates of newborns, because, on that day, India would start its journey to real, meaningful freedom.

                            I never knew Yakub was so innocent. Besides I have a question. If the agencies trick Dawood in to India and then arrest him, will he escape the gallow? Then Kasab and his fellow terrorists could have claimed same refuse. I also wonder whether similar parameter would be applicable to any RSS or so called Hindu terrorists from NE or a Hindu Maoists who have blown up Jnaneshwari Express killing at least 500 people. Because when Govt claimed killing NE militants in Myanmar no one raised their voice. But had it been Pakistan all like minded people would have taken out procession in New Delhi. But we will not accept the fact that Yakub is innocent. Supreme court is the final word for us. Right now there is an attack in Punjab by terrorists. Fresh attack, Why do not you book your mercy petition in advance.

                            Whenever there is an execution in India, people discuss the crime committed by the person to be executed. This is meaningless. When it is decided by the highest court of the country that the person should be executed, we are nobody to question the correctness of the judgement. It also goes through several appeals and finally the Presidential pardon system. <br/>
The debate instead, should be whether death sentence should be abolished or not, no matter what the crime is committed. Almost all the countries in the world have abolished death sentence. They have realized that killing a human being by the state serves no purpose to the society; it only quench the thirst of revenge/feeling of judgement of the victims kins. The first argument against death sentence is that it does not deter future crimes. The second argument is death sentences can never be neutral. For example we cannot execute Rajoana due popular opposition, but at the same time we can swiftly execute Kasab for the same crime (the quantum may be different, but killing one person and killing several people makes no difference). Since death sentence is such a sensitive issue, it will always be interfered by politics and politicians, and so it cannot be neutral. <br/>
But in a country where we have such tremendous threats of terrorism and extreme level of goondaism, is it practically possible? In 2011, at Norway Anders Behring Breivik killed many people, but he will never be executed.

                            I generally won't side with the terrorists but in this case if it is true that he came forward to clear his name then I find it highly ludicrous to hand him a death sentence. I also remember the story of hijacked plane taken to Kabul which has sort of made up our mind to execute terrorists whenever we can. But we should also look at the negative repercussions. Anybody who thought they didn't deserve the punishment may teach negative behavior to the younger generation

                            I am amused to see orchestration of a criminal by indian media, political honchos. When terror attacks happens they state terror has no religion when punishment or verdict given same call foul play in the name of religion and claim his innocence. Be it sanjay dutts case or yakubs case or any other case. scoop tricks for media, vote bank for political leaders, bread and butter for terrorists this is what happening in India. once he is hanged for his crimes he will be surely orchestrated as martyrr by his fellowmates.

                            Ok, admitted, Yakub is a great guy. But does his MA(English), surrender, or a 'blessing' to the judge for God's amnesty, vindicates his role in the blasts? Or law should start behave like a epitome of mercy and mitigate anyone's punishment for heinous crimes? Such acts are a great attribute at a personal level. But in a society a person have to carry his retribution according to gravity of his crime.

                            I agree with Meena Menon to some extent. At least he came back to India and surrendered. Isn't this true ? He has already spent 20 years in jail. Every other members of his family were found guilty, but not his wife. Even if he was not directly involve in those blasts (according to him), but if he was aware of those plans, he could have prevented them. He should have asked for mercy from those who lost there loved ones. <br/>
If he was indeed innocent and unaware (God only knows since all circumstantial evidences are against him) then he would be wrongly convicted for his brothers sin. If we should have any soft corner for him, it's just because he came back and cooperated with the authorities. Just a logical thinking !

                            Now I know why people despise the hindu newspaper.its due to pathetic editors like you.Even if he surrendered then did that make his crime any less?Are you questioning the judgement of the supreme court or the supreme court itself?Did you think about the people who lost there life?In my opinion,people like you are as much guilty as these terrorists.The only difference being you kill by words and they kill by weapons.Ashamed to be an Indian today where m0rons like you write garbage and get away with it also...

                            while it is too boring to read the entire article, I would still say that a person who is hiding behind the Enemy should never be called as tiger. we all know what to call such people.

                            Do you think the courts are stupid to hang Yakub for Tiger? If this is the trust you have for our highest court - I dont know what to say. Supreme court is the final judge thats it, so you like it or not.

                            Are you kidding. You want readers to think this guy is almost innocent because this guy and his lawyer say? Thanks god, you are not the judge. Are you saying Supreme court judges punished this guy without evidence? even if you are saying the punishment is disproportionate, where is your argument based on facts? your article reads more like an autobiography of the guy! really you didn't get anything better to do?

                            Its become fashion to take "contrary view" and trying to invoke "Unnatural emotions". Thats why, for ONE life of a criminal, who authored elimination of hundreds of life, ,soooo much interference &amp; questioning of law. Sad &amp; Sick

                            there is still a 1 percent chance that he is innocent if he came back to India along with his family on his own sweet will.

                            India must show class. Spare the man. He has conducted himself well, admitted to his guilt. Can we get blood out of stone!

                            @: I dont want to get in legal technicalities but if yakub was involved(to warrant a death penalty) being such a educated fellow will he return to india.Circumstances of his return still in clouded in mystery irrespective of what govt clarifies.In 1994 even govt agreed he surrendered on his own.He should be punished for whatever his nature of involvement but death is too harsh,it sends a wrong signal to others about our legal system.

                            Although I do not buy the argument in this blog, I do support that the death sentence should be abolished from India. We live in a mature world and death sentence is quite in-appropriate in this age. It is sad that Yakub has to die however his information could have been used in international court to bring back Daud and others involved who are freely roaming in Pakistan.
