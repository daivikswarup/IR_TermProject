Headline::::Kanhaiya, Misguided Idealist With Stale Slogans



DateTime::::2016-03-08T14:08:00+05:30




                                The law of unintended consequences works in strange ways. An overzealous Delhi Police made the cardinal error of arresting a minor student leader, that too on sedition charges, from JNU, the bastion of the Left and the extreme Left. All hell broke loose on this arrest. Our right to freedom of expression, protected by 69 years of freedom, multiple Supreme Court decisions, a free and cacophonous media, and a vibrant Opposition, was suddenly threatened as never before. Our age-old sedition laws, unworkable because of Supreme Court decisions, with over 8,000 cases reportedly filed in the Kundakulam case, was suddenly highlighted as an example of a Police State in India. And Kanhaiya Kumar, the poor student leader, was suddenly hailed as the new Messiah, here to liberate us from Big Brother, and the new youth icon who pushed aside the Original Youth Icon, the Vice President of India's oldest political party.
Within a fortnight, the media, the Opposition, many commentators and do-gooders had their answer to a person who could challenge PM Modi himself! Adding to this, many self-indignant citizens wrote disapprovingly of how students like Kumar were wasting hard-earned tax payers' monies by politicking instead of studying in University, depriving other students of a good education.
Of course Kumar played the role to a T. He denied making anti-national slogans. He said he never wanted azaadi from India, he attended the Afzal Guru rally to stop bad elements from mouthing offensive slogans and sought to cool tempers down, and in return, he was hounded and arrested by the police and charged with one of the biggest crimes: sedition. He was the victim, and that too from a poor family, who had worked hard and fought his way purely on merit to the greatest bastion of freedom in  India, JNU, so that he could fight for the oppressed and downtrodden. All probably true. Kumar is an idealist, though a bit misguided, espousing extreme Left causes, and a bit confused as to solutions, mouthing the stale slogans of the Left.
 
On release from jail, he entered JNU  triumphantly much in the way of Caesar's Entry into Rome after his conquests. He had a hero's welcome in JNU, where the more anti-establishment and more extreme one is, the more one is adored. He made a great speech with wonderful histrionics, much slogan-shouting, much gesticulation, though devoid of substance and the right statements; he said he was seeking azaadi from hunger, from oppression, from capitalism, and finally from PM Modi. All this  to a delirious response from the largely Left crowd and a media which had this as breaking news which broke all news! He was hailed by the Left as their saviour, one who would campaign for them in the forthcoming state elections and resurrect their fallen status.
 
JNU students' union president Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested on charges of sedition after a protest on Afzal Guru's execution. (File photo)
For a few days after, he was pursued by innumerable media channels, answering all questions with aplomb, again devoid of substance, with breathless media anchors including the Great Barkha who declared him the new youth icon, giving the original youth icon some real worries. Nobody ever explained what was the great idea or accomplishment that made him a youth icon.
Sadly for Kumar, the media suddenly discovered the King of Good Times, who was declared a wilful  defaulter on his bank loans, and who cut a personal sweetheart deal of $75 million with an MNC. They went after him with a vengeance, baying for his blood! Kumar was suddenly consigned to the back of beyond, having served his purpose of giving the masses great entertainment for a few days.
 
So how are we to understand and read the happenings at JNU?
 
Undoubtedly, the police made a mistake in arresting a minor student union leader in a Leftist institution. Undoubtedly, the government and the ruling party made a mistake in making this a case of nationalism and patriotism, falling into the trap set by the Left and extreme Left. The lawyers of Patiala Court suddenly saw a chance to prove their extreme nationalism and patriotism, indulging in violence, forgetting their duty to the rule of law and covered themselves with shame. The government had egg on its face being portrayed in India and overseas as not protecting freedom of expression in a democracy, being dictatorial, accused of creating Emergency-like conditions by Leftist academia globally led by the Great Master himself, Noam Chomsky.
It was in essence a comedy of errors, grand entertainment, much like the great Roman Circus, fed to the masses to divert their attention from their growing disenchantment with perverse Opposition politics which was holding the nation to ransom.
 
What of Kumar himself? Poor Kumar is now left alone, with the great cause of being the Saviour of the Nation behind him and no greater cause to fight for, except living off stale slogans. Sadly, after all the excitement and the media attention, he is left alone to fight the sedition cases probably for the next 20 years under the gaze of a sullen police keeping watch over him. At age 28, he soon will need to complete his PhD, go out into the brave new world to eke out a living, or carry on being a revolutionary in an era where revolutions are passe, joining a political party which is a ghost of its past. He will discover that mere slogans in JNU are no solutions to society's challenges and even the Great Yechury, India's version of Che Guevara himself, from the same JNU, after decades of revolution, has hardly made any impact despite being the flag bearer of a failed-ideology!
Kanhaiya, all of us admire you for your passion, your energy, your eloquence, your courage, your forthrightness, much as we disagree with your views and your slogans, because we see in you the idealism we had when we were in college and wish you all the best for the future!(Mohandas Pai was the CFO and then the head of HR at Infosys.

                            So Mr Mohandas you want students should be devoid of idealistic beliefs because idealism doesn't work in real life .... right? But you stopped short of saying that corruption works in real life. Now I admire the great realist (idealist) in you and why you were so successful.

                            What is failed ideology ? Socialism or Communism or communalism  Even today Communism works better in Kerala. They may not have  bought big business houses but they always stood by poor laborers rights. Due to their struggle elements like RSS and Sangh Pariwar do not grow in Progressive states. Their ideology in economics may be failed but their ideology in terms of human rights still stands high. So without these people India will be autocratic and fascist, so their presence is required .  Let Kanhaiya shout and bring some balance before  right groups completely take over India.

I do not understand why this idiot who do not know how to respect people feelings when thousands of employees and their families were in trouble due to Satyam computers issue, made a comment that " They do not want to recruit employees from tainted company". i do not understand why people still give importance to this kind of people just because he has some money to invest and boasts himself as investor. people should block out when they see this kind of idiots.

                            You are an educated illiterate of the 'money hungry upper middle class' who does not know the meaning of education. Does the education has only one colonial purpose of creating citizens to work in the slavery system of corporate/institutions and earn money for them as well as for self. Education has lot of purposes and that way Kanhaiya already deserve a PhD who has done more than writing a thesis by copying and without any new ideas.He has contributed much more than the majority of the PhD for a social/human cause whatever happens to his ideology or his own achievements in the future

What Mohandas Pai should try to understand is that people are tired of the Sangh's loud bullying and its attempt to define who is national and who is anti-national. They saw the Kanhaiya situation as an opportunity to put the Sangh in its place. <br/><br/>
Kanhiya himself played his part perfectly. He gave a very mature speech and mature responses to various questions after he was released. The contrast between that and the Sangh's hysterical and senseless rhetoric was very clear - whether mouthed by Smriti Irani or Rajnath or lawyers or the poor puppet policemen.  <br/><br/>
This was not some elaborate trap set by the Left as alleged by Mohandas. This was just the Sangh behaving as they usually do in their shrill manner - but this time being completely outplayed.

I cant even understand the basis of their resentment. Forget Kanhaiya for the moment and look at the issues raised by him. Are they really not relevant for people of his stratum of the society. So is he wrong in talking about them? And if he has got his moment today, why is it being resented so much?  The supercilious tone of the article is really a put-off.<br/>
Very Well, Mr Pai, he may fail eventually but he holds the right to try.

Let him be poor or minor, the whole  establishment with all their might along with extreme right wing and communal forces tried to brand him as an anti-national and failed. That made him a hero. <br/>
That was not a mistake of current establishment or right wing forces by any chance. They will do it a thousand times again. Only that, this time they failed miserably.<br/><br/><br/>
The same students will probably look back in to your eyes and say that sir, let us change this world for better, before this world changes us to people like you.

                            kanhaiyya will not be left alone Mr.Pai i for one will be happy to meet part of the costs involved to fight his case. By the way, i request the government to take over all the private instititions in the country. Govt.can run them on the same terms and conditions for the super rich who are filling the coffers for dalals. Instead, the money can go to government and the nation. The idea is a two tier study system . A normal meritorious quota and a paid quota for the iothersv(wont say what category they belong to)<br/>
My main idea is to devimate these dalalals from the education system. I hope the political parties debate this and work towards it.

                            Why majority of Indian IT industry has always remained a subservient labour <br/>
provider doing scavenging jobs of cleaning and maintaining softwares is be cause of their literate but uneducated leaders like mr. Mohandas Pai. India could never build a company like google, apple, Facebook etc because of these kind of people heading the indian tech companies. <br/><br/>
I don't understand why Mr. Pai fails to see the rational philosophy behind that, that almost the entire sillicon valley is supporting apple in its fight against FBI and US government for not helping in the investigation of an already committed terrorist act due to ethical reason and it's long term implication and not just any imaginary future act which will never happen as conceived in case of JNU. If Mr. Pai is truly educated and rational thinker he should stand with JNU.<br/><br/>
Mr. Pai is also blinded by his arrogance that he seems to even ignores or sees lowly of noble laureate Noam Chomsky who in 1956 came up with chomsky hierarchy, a great contribution to theoretical computer science specialy programming language theory, compiler constructon and automata theory without which probably computer languages and hence software and hence the Mr Pai's  bread and butter the indian IT industry would not have existed.

                            Mr. Pai, I'm sorry to say that you are a confused man suffering from short term memory loss. I have read your blog in which you have criticized JNU students (particualry Kanhaiyya) for indulging in politics with taxpayers' money. When your 'taxpayers money concept' punctured, you came up with a new theory of 'stale slogans'. India is a participatory democracy. Everybody has a right to put their views. ‘Har har modi ghar ghar modi' was a slogan and I have no problem with it. Similarly, there were many slogans kept emerging in Indian politics. When BJP asked for ‘congress mukhth bharath', they were literally asking for 'azadi' from congress misrule, and again I have no problem. If Kanhaiyya asks for azadi from some social evils, you are not ready to accept it!! You get your ass burnt!! Why is it so?? Doctored Sambith Pathra and Times now made every possible effort to implicate Kanhaiyya and his fellow students under sedition by airing doctored videos. At that time, you have no guts to criticize it. You keep criticizing JNU/Kanhaiyya/news reporters because they are against your political ideology. Get a life man!!

                            You are part of one of the biggest private education industry in this country- Manipal University. No wonder you have a disdain for public education and its recipients ( your last opinion was abt your tax money for JNU). I don't agree to Kanyia's ideologies but that does not mean that his ideas are stale- is poverty stale? are farmers suicide stale? is casteism  stale?. This is your second piece about him- if he is  a 'minor 'student leader by your standards why bother writing  two opinion pieces about him Mr Pai????

                            This is one episode where all parties who had a part have come out badly. The government acted in haste and refused to course correct. Opposition indulged in blatant opportunism without clarifying what they are supporting. Press divided into those who painted the students as villians based on poor evidence, while the other section defended acts which should not be and painted the same students as heroes even though they contributed nothing. The police reacted late to the evidence and allowed some lawyers to run amok. Some activists and JNU students made this a freedom of speech issue which it is not - and that is selective double speak and hypocrisy. The largely leftist and partisan nature of the debate in JNU has also come to the fore and does the university no credit, especially the claim of standing for freedom of expression is exposed as hollow.<br/><br/>
I appreciate the balance in this article - there are very few who have been as balanced as Mohandas Pai. The damage however is real - the middle ground where sensible debate, reasoning, listening to the opposite viewpoint and humility exists is lost. We are all the losers as a result.

                            The State of India was got not as a lottery. The current establishment, whoever heads it, is because of the hard work by generations of leaders, visioneries and the people of India. We can't let a few reckless anarchists destroy that just  because they have nothing at stake. Let  KK look around beyond our country and see how people in some countries suffer because the system/establishment has collapsed   The easiest thing is to be disruptive but very difficult to be constructive and contribute

                            It is not idealism, it is ridiculism. It is sloganeering for garnering quick and easy support from fellow losers.India has been fed with leftist sloganeering and ridiculogy for long, whether it was gareebi politics or those movies in which a trade union leader (hero) is all nice and all industrialists are devils. It will take time for India to mature. About this guy, you will see that IN COMING DAYS, LEFT AND CONGRESS WILL LEAVE HIM BECAUSE THEY REALIZE HE IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND THEY DON'T HAVE DEFENSE FOR HIS AZADI SLOGAN.on the other hand, the ruling party will want that he stays in media, Oh the Irony! ha ha

                            What people like the author seem to ignore is that Kanhaiya and people of his 'ilk ín JNU did not seek out the media or its glare. They were content in their microcosm that is JNU and their activities, the extremist slogans,festivals  included, were at most in the style of politics manifested in theatrics,symbolism, nukkad nataks and folk theatre. It would have stayed at that level were in not for the utter hyper nationalist twist presented to it by some sections of the media and some intellectual section who thought this is a right time to get back at JNU.

                            I am wary of the hypothetical situation that may arise if ArKe, Raga, NiKu, Mamta, SiYe or Kishen Kanhaiya would do if they adorn the PM's post ... seriously while hurling abuses at PM Modi - just be true to yourself once and imagine do these people have the experience or persona to become a PM? <br/><br/>
The greatest service that the Modi detractors could do is to try to reform the above to PM material and then oppose people like me who want PM Modi to continue his work. The sad thing is that they are just raising decibels and display no element of leadership equal to or surpassing NaMo! If they change their ways and really rise to the expectations set for the PM - then that would really become game changer (I dont think it would happen though)

                            Just look at Mr. Pai's choice of words: "[Kanhaiya story was] fed to the masses to divert their attention from their growing disenchantment with perverse Opposition politics which was holding the nation to ransom". Presumably, all of this was a media creation to protect the opposition! Are you serious Mr. Pai? And what about the Home Minister who sought to hang a terrorist label on Kanhaiya on the basis of a fake tweet? A more plausible story line is that this was a government trying to divert attention away from the Rohit Vemula tragedy; a government trying to divert attention away from the fact that managing an economy requires far more skill than bombastic election slogans; and finally it was the BJP trying to keep the flock together after the mauling in Bihar.

 For God's sake Kanhaiya is 28...not a teenager!!! He's wasting his precious time in the comforts of JNU campus. If he really means what he says then he should dare to get into the real world and build India of his dreams.

If Kanhaiya Kumar is Media creation then your favourite Pm ,our Pm is also nothing but Media creation(ofcourse the Media which is biased towards Modi(Read zee and Times nOw).If Kanhaiya's speeches are hallow without substance but make a good speech then all the Modi speeches are also same...without any substance but good in rhetoric.<br/>
I guess ,you need to find a Good job for urself after crashing/resigning out of Infosys,I guess you hope Modi to give you a good post for supporting the ruling govt daily on TV shows.Hope it works and u r rewarded by Modi,but see even Swapan DasGupts is in Queue before you,so you need to wait and may be even fight harder for BJP/NDA on Prime time shows for much longer period.

Sorry sir! unfortunately the comedy of errors and lies was or is not from Opposition but from our beloved unqualified pseudo emotional BAHU madam Smithi Irani and the TV Channels rushing for TRP. It is she and the TV Channels who have created this Kanhaiya Why point the fingers on opposition now. The HR Minister and the TV channels  should have examin the case more carefully and credibly instead of jumping to conclusion on doctored and decorated false tapes.The perpetarators of henious crime of shouting antinational slogans should have been cought redhanded more tactfuly when we had the intelgence reports instead of shouting in Parliment and on TV channels as if enacting an over charged emotional drama for free entertainment

                            Kanhaiya thinks left is sleeping giant that he can wake up but unfortunately communism is dead everywhere and it is hard for him to find any support. The problem with communism is, although a great philosophy, it goes against the very human nature. If there is no reward why would anyone put in hard work. People become lazy and feel they are entitled to get everything.

He keeps saying there is no essence or substance to KKs speeches. There was a guy with lot of substance and no speech in MMS and there is a guy who is only speech and no substance in NaMo. Ppl chose the latter. If someone 28 has great oratorical skills and no substance nurture him instead of dismissing him. He is the future. If he is misguided show him the path instead of criticizing him. Another one opposition is holding the nation at ransom? The greatest and the largest party in the world is so proud and flaunts around that they introduced this disrupting parliament proceedings to parliamentary democracy. Did you have an opinion then?

                            Why there is no much hatred in our country for each other? Even from someone like Mr. Pai? People have different opinions but discussions can't happen on opinions alone. Its a fact that police has not been able to find any proof of Kanahiya's involvement and his arrest was more on a hunch than facts. Its a fact BJP and some cabinet ministers went on record to show fake videos on tv and re-tweeting about his involvement in the matter. And, why all of a sudden we have turned into a nation to tell how someone should conduct his/her life? Right from a 15 year old to a 60 years old everyone has advice for Kanahiya but what about his advice to you? <br/><br/>
Mr. Pai if you don't even consider Left an idealogy then how can you even measure what Mr. Yechury has accomplished? In my 20 years following Indian politics i have never seen the guy demeaning anyone with poor choice of words unlike our Honourable PM, has never heard his name involved in any scams, has never heard him indulging in rethoric ignoring facts and has certainly not seen him demeaning other people bcause of their beliefs.

                            I loved this wonderful article. Pai has come a ways of late, and has improved his writing skills by leaps and bounds, e.g., he writes grammatically correct sentences (or has them written well). But, Pai, realize it is irritating to see randomly capitalized words many many times in the article.<br/><br/>
Few questions here. When you were profiting from the back-breaking, uncertain and stressed lives of a lakh odd workers at Infosys through repressive management techniques of fear and instability in work and in evaluation, did it occur to you that the capitalist system is a failure? That it can only give a handful of people like you - aggressive, with ordinary skills but very useful as amoral tools of management - a toehold in the system of efficient exploitation of human resources created by a Murty here and a Premji there?<br/><br/>
When you put up your incompetent lackeys across your spheres of influence in your previous company, did you ever reflect upon how hypocritical your talk about "zero tolerance for non-performance" was? What was your own competence to speak about India's IITs and other institutions about whom you spewed so much abuse?<br/><br/>
Is your current spitting of bile towards student politics and government subsidized education a strategy to "farm" more people towards your beloved Manipal education services?

                            The basic premise of kanaya speech itself is not valid as jnu has stopped many people to speak in the campus , so where is the freedom or azadi their .. That itself shows the hypocrisy?

                            1. Very nicely articulated article with substance unleashing, about Mr.PHDKumar28. But Mr.PHDKumar "28" still dont know how the society works and how to earn money n how to lead a good life. He is still in the Student President Mania!!I am earning money and studied without any Govt Scholarship, without any Govt Financial Help. Nor do I have any Govt JOB. To certain extent I must accept that Capitalism has changed the life of Indians to large extent, even though we have Bad side showing up which we need to deal with cautious!!<br/>
2. Mr.PHDKumar28 , its very nice to have a slogan of freedom from Hunger( But do you really know how to raise the funds in a society where you have different mindsets, varieties of views! Ask Mohan Das Pai, to know atleast how to plan smoothly ! u cant force people to do things which you want to takeupon! Humbleness with Smartness n knowledge is impaortant.Some say we need to help out to cure hunger and then educate, some say they need to comeup with littlehelp, but we need to give them education so that they can only take care. India is not a homogenous society like you think of! neither your slogans will be followed in the contemparary society where everybody questions each step, and each is becoming independent economically , and u know India is mainly driven by "Bhaavana" and "Trust" and "Humble" ness : Not by Force or oppressive thought! <br/>
3.As Mr Pai said, where are core substance in your speech apart from Opression, Hunger, Capitalism, Implementing Constitution on the ground(be aware our nation did not born due to constitution and mere constitution cannot change the cultural aspect how people behave!! Our constitution indeed good, but done by keeping the view of our people much.)

                            Spot on. Anyone foolish enough to espouse the left ideology of any nature is doomed to failure. Kanhaiya will sink into oblivion as quickly as he rose from it. He was always just a media creation. Now the bubble has burst. By the way, what is the condition of his academics, for which he is primarily in JNU? Mere waste of the nation's resources to try and educate the chronically illiterate?

                            Well said Mr. Pai. At least you were able to see through the game and chose to write about. The Press is considered to be a pillar of democracy. But off late in India they have become a law unto themselves conducting media trial on major national events in the name of channel discussions with a stream of ready made panelists to create sensationalism to gain TRP. This circus has all the thrills of a soap opera and recently one actor turned MP supported by Mr. Yechury's party in Kerala wrote a column in one of the vernaculars that watching the Solar scam channel discussions in TV contributed more in his fight against cancer than the Oncologist of AIIMS Delhi. Such is the power of the channels!! You have rightly said that Kaniah Kumar will become worldly wise once steps out into the real world after completing his studies in JNU. He would become more wiser if he spends a few months in any one of the countries which follows the failed ideology.

                            Usually we as Indian always have sympathy for poor and try to help on all capacity so Kanhaiya being poor student draws sympathy and also smart orator as well as thinker but he is definitely misguided and distracted on many things he talked in interviews and his speeches.He can do better positive work for others instead of spitting venom for Hindus and brahmins around him because in this 21st century all those cast based discrimination are unacceptable to almost every one and on the basis of stray odd  incident must not labeled tire Hindu community black.This shows his immaturity or rebellion provocative and revenge is king intention for hear and say stories as it happens to be brain washing of jihadus or extrimists.

                            Mohandas Pai is very intelligent. He do not go into economic cost of developing IT sector. Typical behaviour, use label to brand a person who differs with you.

                            He made some slogans and raised issues it happened inside the walls of JNU, now the culprits running scot free but govt failed in putting real culprits behind the bars. who bothers none?? this nation has more issues than Kanhaiya,, but BJP and other PRO BJP stalwarts like Mohandas Pai shows lukewarm approach in puking insecurity about his growing popularity, please stop writing about him ..instead of demeaning our judiciary about his cases will go by years pls write something about sedition case and its abolition  .. Also JNU is failed issue by government no one cares about it, start writing something productive about how to handle doctored videos by media which incited violence and created ruckus in national capital to avoid these issues ..

                            Sir your peace of advice for K will work better when serious personalities like you can arrange some events for such upcoming educated folks. am sure that will give plenty of good n energetic ideas to them. n may be some of them will actually join politics. those should be a better lot of politicians than those who inherit from family or the typical street goons. I will be delighted to have your thoughts on this.

                            Look at girls talking about joining fighter planes on one hand and on another hand girls shouting at JNU along with Kanhaiya - aazadi chahiye from Hunger and aazadi from garibi. They keep forgetting they are eating subsidized paneer pakoda at JNU canteen and shouting aazadi from garibi. What a joker this left communist ideology

                            Mohandas, he is an idealist never the same. Your good wishes look so laboured. Give some opinion on tongue slashers, condom collectos, murderers, church violators-they are dime a dozen, come out of the woodwork, after getting a fresh lease of life.

                            Kanhaiya is not only misguided but brainwashed too. So are many profs in JNU. I was watching a lecture given by lady prof Menon who was talking about history of Kashmir/NE etc. I just wondering how come she got a job there? She doesn't even have a basic knowledge or perhaps intentionally distorting 'recorded &amp; undisputed' facts.
