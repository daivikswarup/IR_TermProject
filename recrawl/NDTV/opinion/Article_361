Headline::::Then, Parveen Babi. Now, Deepika.



DateTime::::2015-01-21T03:07:00+05:30



(Shobhaa De is an established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator, who is considered an authority on popular culture.)Parveen Babi was ahead of her time in many ways. Ironically, this applies to her fragile mental health issues as well. It's a little sad when one realizes that this luminously beautiful movie star died tragically young and desperately lonely on 22nd January 2005, without her countless fans and colleagues understanding what really led to her premature death, aged 56. Perhaps, the only person who had any inkling about what Babi was going through was her one-time partner, Mahesh Bhatt. But even he was no longer around to pull her out of the abyss when the end came. Parveen Babi died alone, locked inside her apartment in Juhu. By then, she had been declared 'mad' by Bollywood and the press. "Woh toh paagal ho gayee hai," people would shake their heads and declare authoritatively. Poor Parveen Babi. She was not 'paagal' - she was ill. Seriously ill. It is believed she was suffering from a long term, severe mental illness that few cared to figure out. Some say it was depression, others insist she was schizophrenic. Either way, she battled her mental demons on her own, eventually abandoned by even those who claimed to love her.It's a totally different story today. The fresh, new scripts about mental health in Bollywood are being written by two attractive and successful female stars. I am ready to bite my tongue off for saying this, but in the case of Deepika Padukone and Anushka Sharma, I believe there is a bigger marketing plan behind the sudden disclosures. The timing is rather suspect. Is it a mere coincidence that Anushka went public with her anxiety attacks one week and Deepika promptly followed with her own 'I suffer from depression' the next? Deepika has left a telling clue behind by ending her piece with a footnote which says she is working on something major to generate more awareness about mental health in India. Anushka stopped at talking about her own mood swings and emotional dips. Perhaps we'll get to hear announcements of both these gorgeous ladies being nominated brand ambassadors for a jumbo pharma company soon? Regardless, the response to these celeb confessions has been phenomenal. Fans went from expressing disbelief to applauding their 'guts'. One huge taboo had finally been broken - that too by two Bollywood A-Listers. "Bravo!" chorused India.  In a nation where mental health remains low priority and is frequently dismissed by family and friends as being nothing more than 'dramabaazi', it did take guts for these two accomplished ladies to share their emotional traumas with the world at large.Bollywood prefers to keep such sensitive stuff strictly under wraps. Bolllywood hides its scars well. Bollywood protects its secrets. Mental health is an area Bollywood stays miles away from. Whether it was Parveen Babi's fragile state in the 90's, or Geeta Dutt's death on 20th July 1972 at the age of 42... Bollywood chose to keep mum. Take a look at other stories: Was Meena Kumari really an alcoholic? Why did she seek solace in spirits? What killed Rajesh Khanna - cancer, booze ... or loneliness? So many Bollywood biggies descended into private hells after tasting enormous fame and glory. And yet, nobody was ready to confront a few ugly truths behind that descent.  It hasn't changed all that much even today. One hears whispers and stories about yesteryear legends popping pills, knocking back booze, behaving uncharacteristically, talking incoherently, cutting off from the world... getting more and more isolated, and finally dying an inglorious death in penury and obscurity. Who cares? Who bothers to find out what the person was suffering from? There is no space in Bollywood for people who are no longer in the running... people who are mentally troubled, weakened, unable to deal with extreme stress levels, incapable of playing the parts assigned to them. This is where Deepika and Anushka can play key roles, not just in Bollywood but in a far larger context. We don't have enough awareness of various forms of mental illness. Most people divide this hoary, misunderstood world into two broad categories - 'paagal' and 'gone case'. Parveen, unfortunately, fell into the 'gone case' category. In the sense that she was unable to engage with the world like everybody else and had become severely delusional. Abandoned by all, she was locked in her own world, dealing with fierce demons and fears minus any emotional support systems to fall back on. It was easier to shun her. The once ethereally beautiful star with a svelte body had turned puffy and unrecognizable towards the end. She couldn't save herself. And nobody bothered to save her.The strains and pressures of being in showbiz are best understood by those deeply immersed in it. Stars like Deepika and Anushka. Often, fans are told a young actress has 'fainted' or 'collapsed' on the sets. The reasons are attributed to 'exhaustion'. Physical exhaustion. The truth of the matter maybe different. Chances are it is more a mental breakdown than a physical one. Is that so hard to accept? Maybe, with the well-timed revelations and interventions coming from Deepika and Anushka, there will be a heightened sensitivity towards several mental afflictions that have previously been swept under the carpet.There is no condition on earth - mental or physical - that cannot be helped, if society cares enough. It's high time we did.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Somehow this article is reflecting more sarcastic view than a sympathetic. What is a logic comparing Deepika with Parveen Babi? It could have been better if Deepika's guts were admired to share her life in public instead pointing out how Parveen Babi died. Hates off to Deepika's courage and talent who made her space in the industry and shared her life in public. Longer, shorter, peaceful or chaotic  life is insignificant if a person lives a symbolic life in a way which can be remembered by generations to come. Tell me if Deepika reads your blog ( by mistake) is she gonna be delighted or more dipressed... Hope you focus on sensitivity of individual's rather then utter something coz u got platform to do so.

                            Mahesh Bhatt once said earlier that he left Parveen babi when she was diagnosed with a serious health condition, what a great man. Now he keeps preaching how to be good human being. The first thing a person with serious illness will face is his circle changing. In a way disease is the greatest teacher in this world. It differentiates real from fake very easily.

                            Yet another useless article written by Ms. Shobha De. Instead of talking about how friends and family can help these people, she kept ranting about how they don't. We already know that Ms. De! I was hoping you'd at some point talk about how we can help!!! But of course not and continued with the usual allegations on Bollywood, when in reality there wasn't much awareness on depression not just in India, but around the world.

                            Even if these are marketing gimmicks, one thing is for sure, it's time to get out in open &amp; discuss this issue. Mental illness is status,fame,money,success &amp; beauty NEUTRAL. It afflicts millions who suffer in silence &amp; apathy.  It's refreshing that marketing companies are opening up to this issue.

                            For a change, I totally agree with Shobha de. Bollywood is full of fake friendships and relationships. Every actress when they progress from struggle phase to established phase, they cut off their old relationships and start a new one which matches their new financial status and try to live in an atmosphere of चमक धमक.

                            Let me try to understand this. Does this happen only in bollywood? If it does, is the addiction to fame at the early stage of a career and the lack of it towards the end, cause of it? Schizophrenia is also caused by overuse of recreational drugs.

                            It happens when people get involved in their career too much, thinking of it 24 hours. Keeping family, friends far from it. It doesn't matter how many hits u have on box office, ultimately u should have ur own family, spouse, kids, who can love you unconditionally. Look at Amitabh, Shahrukh, Jitendra, Rishi kapoor, Jaya bachchan, Tanuja, Mumtaj etc. All these people had a set family life so they maintained their after career life well. Work and family both should have equal importance.

                            Good Stuff. I echo that its not easy to accept your mental state but at that time you don't even realize that something is wrong with you.. You continue to go through that stage and damage yourself.. the acceptance comes only after the damage is done or the correction has happend. So its more important for the close ones to notice / acknowledge/accept the situation.. A social stigma for going to a psychiatrist should remain with the society only.. not for your loved ones.. I have realized many times that I need medical help to get my minds stablised but was shunned off all the times.. SAD SAD SAD.. Don't want to die alone like Praveen babi.. but want to come up strongly and openly like deepika padukone.. Thnks Deepika for making me realizing me what has happened to me.. I owe a lot to you...

                            I don't see any harm if either of the two starletts come up with an endorsement or become brand ambassadors of pharma companies. What they have done is appreciable. Mental health is not just a high society or Bollywood issue. Its a global issue. Having been in denial about the mental health of a very close family member, I am very happy that such things are being discussed in India now.

                            Thank you!<br/>
I had been a counselor. I understand what you write here.<br/>
Mental illness, whether yours or your loved one's isn't something to run away from. It is also not a curse or an incurable condition or something to feel scared about. Like physical illness, most mental illnesses are curable or manageable. Very few of them are terminally harmful to the patient and in even rarer conditions, to their family. Most depression cases don't even need medicines. <br/>
Psychological illness seldom arises in vacuum. To treat such a patient, often the family also needs counseling - and that is where people don't understand and refuse.<br/>
Again, thank you!

She is strong minded, disciplined, professional and is much open person... which she should be commended for....  your point abt mental illness is fine but there was no need to do a comparative analysis.....

                            This article shows the poor moral character and limited intelligence of Shobha De. With all those cruel words used in quotation marks, it's as if she is using those words herself and quotes are her disclaimer strategies while taking shots at people with mental health issues. Society will have 100 words for someone with mental illness but using those here was completely uncalled for. In addition, with a veneer of fake sympathy she is displaying her cynicism when questioning celebrities coming ahead to discuss mental health issues openly. Of course, no matter what celebrities do, it will be a news. At least in this example, they are making waves about a good cause, what's wrong with that? And questioning their timing is fatuous, since no time is a bad time to discuss this issue. The passive aggressive tone of this article is disgusting! If she was in the US, people dealing with mental health issues and their loved ones would have sued her!

You as an accomplished write and columnist and many other things would do a great service to our society by stepping back and addressing a society at large where people need to be made aware of mental sickness issues as another sickness which needs to be treated not looked down upon.

                            It is surprising in a country like India where thousands of patients are down in mental health and this domain of health care is getting least of attention,mental health conditions of two film stars has become a big topic for the country.<br/>
It is not only the two actoresses who need to be attended for alleged deterioration in their  mental health but a large population of the country which is suffering and does not  have access to a proper treatment be also taken care of.It is necessary that domain of mental health itself  be given adequate care so that thousands of "patients" falling in this category could be treated.

                            This is a very normal thing affecting anyone. Anyone who wishes to have extra from normal has to go through these stresses and strains. They being celebrities, people are very anxious to know in detail. detail meaning even going to the extent what they do on the bed too. with whom they sleep and what not. This is nothing but putting pressures on the person. Now since you earn because of these people they also have the right to know these details and in the process all these ills like depression etc takes place. Being celebrities it gets highlighted. it happens in our lives too but are not highlighted because we are not celebrities. That is why god always sends a message to stay away from materialistic attractions and go for spiritual upliftment. but the craze for being noticed and becoming celebrity is so high that people overlook the negative consequences and just go for it. when breakdown happens then they repent. ITS NATURE AND VERY NORMAL. NOT MUCH IMPORTANCE SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THESE ISSUES.

                            This is an excellent article. Bollywood and regional cinemas too had several such cases of mental illnesses. Is it because the beautiful Mumbai has now become a rotten place, like many places in India. New Delhi in good old days was beautiful and look at it now. Bollywood actors deal with beautiful world, in at least movies, and for them it must be shocking, over time, to see that their surroundings are getting rotten. I have a feeling that many old Indians have mental problems because they see a decaying urban and rural structure under the pressure of huge population pressure which their country can not with stand.
