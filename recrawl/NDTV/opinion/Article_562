Headline::::AAP Government's Defamation Diktat is Not Excessive



DateTime::::2015-05-13T02:46:00+05:30




                                I spent 23 years in journalism - four years in print and 19 years in TV (I was among the first to move to Television in 1994). At the time, print used to look down upon us TV reporters; they called us "byte soldiers" or "headless chickens". We were the subject of ridicule and contempt over many a drink in the Press Club. In fact, a very senior and respected editor went to the extent of saying that those who had failed in print had joined TV. But as time passed, Aaj Tak and News Tonight of NDTV became popular, and people on the ground started recognizing TV reporters. The perception started changing from "ridicule" to "indifference" to "respect", and finally to "envy". We were better-paid, better-recognized and had better access in the powers of corridor. From cabinet ministers to top bureaucrats - they wanted to address a bigger all-India audience, wanted to make an impact, and they preferred TV over print. By the year 2000, 24-hour news channels had changed the rules of the game completely and TV was the new king of media.
This was, in my opinion, the golden period of TV journalism. There were, at the most, three 24 hours news channels. "TRPs" was not a buzz word. Content was clean, discussion was meaningful - and audible. Senior politicians used to visit TV studios. OB vans had not mushroomed. Crime and tabloidisation were not encouraged in the news rooms. One could feel proud at the end of the day of the journalism one had done and go home satisfied with a job done well. But from 2004, with the launch of a few more TV channels, the narrative changed and the downward slide could be seen. Sex, sleaze, stings, crime and sensation began rearing their heads as new content leaders. Crime shows became the new channels drivers. TRP was the new monster. Ghosts, snakes, aliens, astrology, religion, mysticism and concocted stories captured TV screens. A fellow editor, an expert in creating TRP-winning shows used to say - "Jitne neech girogey, utni ratings aayengi" (The lower the quality of content, the higher the TRPs).
Sensation was the winner. A new style of writing was invented. To garner more ratings, a below-the-belt attack on any subject became the order of the day. TV started discovering a villain a day. Discussion on TV was still a rarity, except on English news channels. But with the 26/11 Mumbai attack, a new type of journalism took birth. Extreme nationalism, calling for destruction of the enemy country and not allowing others to speak raised the decibels to unprecedented levels in the studios. Anchors turned into judge and jury. Within one hour, the verdict and the conviction was to be pronounced, and those who could not do that were called names. Anchors became the moral guardians of society. Senior and serious political players started disappearing from studio discussions, and only those were left who were willing to be insulted for a few minutes of TV appearances. But another twist in the tale was to come.
The 2014 national election threw up a new kind of journalism and new kind of journalists. "Paid news" was tossed about. TV journalists and media became a willing partner in the annihilation of rival political parties and leaders. A section of the press openly sided with Modi allegedly due to financial lure by some backers or out of fear.
I had left media by the time elections were announced, and as a political worker, it was a new experience. Some self-respecting editors and top journalists had to quit their jobs. From the point of view of journalism, the Delhi assembly election in February 2015 would go down in history as the darkest that I have witnessed. And I repeat it was "supari journalism" at its worst. Five channels openly boycotted AAP and Arvind Kejriwal from their channel. Those who don't believe me should institute an independent inquiry. Once elections were over, I had thought picture would get better but I was wrong.
I cite three examples. Farmer Gajendra Singh's suicide was painted in a section of the media as a conspiracy hatched by senior AAP leaders like Manish Sisodia and Kumar Vishwas to attract people's attention to our rally. All kinds of stories were concocted - how Manish was in touch with Gajendra Singh; how he came to meet him; how Kumar was seen to be conspiring behind the stage for the suicide. This ran for a good three days without any verification and confirmation of the same. Any self-respecting reporter and channel should not have carried these unsubstantiated allegations, at best, and fabrications, at worst.
Secondly, an "illicit" relationship of Kumar Vishwas was invented by few TV channels when the woman concerned had not suggested anything of the kind, but again, the facts didn't get in the way.  For four days, the story made sensational headlines; the issue was debated for hours. Nobody was bothered about its impact on Kumar's family, his grown-up daughters. His father could not bear the pain and was hospitalized. Remember Snoopgate? In that case, government machinery had been misused. Yet, TV channels were so circumspect about what they said and how it was framed because it was related to Modi and Amit Shah.
A minor Delhi government official was removed from his posting, it continued as a headline for two weeks. But when the union Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary were removed most unceremoniously, the news disappeared quickly. Why this double standard by media?
Today, those who are crying themselves hoarse about the defamation circular issued by the AAP government should also talk about this "cannibalistic" journalism. I want to ask the Editors Guild of India (EGI) and Broadcast Editors Associations (BEA) what have they done to extricate the media from this malaise. Have they ever spoken against the forces of fascism who want to end the media freedom through intimidation? The fact is that today the media, especially TV, is living in fear. Freedom of the press is not compromised due to a defamation circular - after all, that right is enshrined in our body of laws. But yes, media freedom will soon be exterminated if institutions like EGI and BEA decide to keep mum over the bigger dangers to democracy.
AAP does not fear criticism, rather it welcomes it, but it will fight cannibalistic journalism.

Every move right from Arvind cough was shown to the people and now since you guys have come back to power and unceremoniusly sacked Yogendra and the Bhushan's, media shouln't question you guys? You guys are sick and reek of double standards

You use media to its maximum to garner votes and when it speaks something against you, you try to gag it. Sir, people are watching.Your actions are speaking louder than your words.So better put your acts together and do some thing for Delhi, rather than writing blogs after blogs.

Almost every other day he would selectively pick up someone &amp; would call him corrupt with half cooked evidences.press was too keen to oblige him. Now when they are in owner they have started singing a different tune. Ashutosh in nutshell you are defending the indefensible.

                            So, the quality and credibility of media has fallen since year 2004? Did you raise a strong voice against it from 2004 till 2015? Or is it that you realized the degradation only when AAP was criticized? Your boss incidentally does not mind throwing unsubstantiated charges against others, the same crime that you are accusing the media of.

It is unfortunate to see how these activists for free speech and transparency have flip-flopped and now are taking steps to curb freedom of expression in such a draconian manner.

                            Why does Ashutosh write like a 12 year old? I don't mean the language(thats perfectly fine), but what I mean is the "tone". This article reads like the sort of justification that a child would give for why "his/her sibling should be punished by the parent"-- "She took my ice-cream", "she broke my toy car". What's with the "media did this to me" stories? Does he actually think the effect of "sensationalism" on AAP's image counts as a justification for this "diktat"? Every politician feels the same way about whichever stories that come our against their party. A congressi would feel the UPA scams were overblown, A BJP worker would feel Ghar-Wapsi was misrepresented by the media. They even "voice" their displeasure routinely by using the very same "TV media". What you call sensationalism is another man's "breaking news" or "investigative journalism". By this diktat, the AAP is trying to make the media scared of reporting anything against the govt(because of a fear of facing litigation). The delhi-govt should improve their PR machinery by holding more frequent press-conferences and briefing your politicians on the "what the party line is". But finally, there should not be any scenario where the govt and media behave like "bhai-bhai", because that is not the sort of relationship that "we" the viwers need. We need the media to be "critical" and "opinionated" not a parrot that reproduces what the the govt tells them. I would like to remind Ashutosh about what Kejriwal told right after the election. He said "The BJP lost because they got arrogant, we should not be arrogant like them". The 67 seats is not a mandate for screwing with the media, it is a mandate for development. Do your job, if you do it well, people will vote for you. If you become too "self-important", the same 55% of Delhities will throw you out. Its funny that Ashutosh uses "diktat" in his article's title. Here is what diktat means-- "A diktat is a statute, harsh penalty or settlement imposed upon a defeated party by the victor, or a dogmatic decree". Surely, Ashutosh would know what a "Freudian slip" is?

                            Well said Ashutosh! Media especially tv media has lost its credibility. It is gaining same notoriety as politicians. They are fast loosing public sympathy and seriousness. Example is Delhi election tv media tried their best to defame Aap even they used to show them as loosing result was evident. I would say ppl did not reject BJP instead rejected media. Now people stopped believing media..and media is on its way to harakiri.

This is precisely folks like me have started moving away from the core voter constituency of AAP. your rise by media is documented . Many of hte leadership were also current ( then) and ex- journos who hailed emperor Kejriwal. But it did nto stop there... you went on the abuse RaGa a bit and went with teh secular bandwagon and abused Modi most. You thought hte best way to call yourself secular was to abuse modi anyways..... <br/><br/>
where was your ethics when your party men and the likes o=to Tehe.llalka abused journalistic ethics... You are getting a taste of yoru won medicine that you gave to Modi... I;m no modi suporter but definitely, the cheaper you went to gain TRP's for your party andmedia attention  has costed you ...

                            Well said Ashutosh. BJP+Congress are from the same breed and were able to garner 51% of vote share during LS elections. The Janta parivaar, the Maya's<br/>
and Jaya's are all dipped and roasted in corruption scandals. What happened to CPM? The left had a golden chance to make Bengal corruption free in 12,410 days. Corruption is root cause of all economy and communal harmony. Let the law deal firmly with communal elements, the mafias and goondas. Let the law deal with corporates who are corrupt. Even the judicial is influenced and that is amply clear with the Maya and Jaya verdict. 18 years after crime, Salman is still roaming scott free. I will cosume 100 GB of disk space if I continue to list all the corrupts in independent India<br/><br/>
Not all of your MLA's will be 100% corruption so you need to have a careful watch. Each and every move of AAP govt is heavily scrutinized. BJP folks are  desperate. shame that they called bus workers strike for a crime that has nothing to do with AAP govt. Let the Rajnath Singh controlled Delhi police protect common man. Shameful to see the head constable beating the women with kids and caught red handed. A powerful section of media will continue to target. Be prepared for it. Your pro-people policies will keep frustrating the marginalized opposition.

I am a delhite and I know that how much our city is struggling, especially since you guys took over.<br/>
Do not dare to talk about the reduced electricity and water bills, I am an educated man so such idiotic unplanned acts without any economic sense behind them do not matter to me.

Why no mention of the constant attacks by little Kejriwal and his little helpers on industrialists, the same industrialists who provide crores of jobs to ordinary every day Indians.  Industrialists produce things that people want.  Politicians and 3rd rate journalists (Ashutosh is a combination of both) produce hot air.  I look forward to Ashutosh having the guts to debunk Kejriwal's professed simple lifestyle and showing the luxury lifestyle he is leading.

Ofcourse, P-TUTES should take responsibility along with Freedom of Expression but the act of Delhi Govt. too is equally bad as P-Tutes.

                            There is a cultural symbiosis between one part of the elite and the other. Here in this case, it is between the politicians in and out of power and the Media elite. The elite walk together even showing paradoxes of behaviour within the overall boundary of elitism. The AAP with its present state when all its idealism and idealist constructs of behaviour are out of its working domain, is not yet accepted fully by the pre-existing dominant elite, that is corrupt, arrogant, and eventually self-annihilating. If I  may put it in the rough journalistic way, it is still the ragging stage for the AAP in the bigger class of the (C.Wright Mills') Power Elite of the United States of India. And so is the case for the Media, especially for the byteing ones.  It is a process of gaining entry. So the word of advice for the AAP is ( if a common man can still give a byte or two to the `leaders' legitimized initially by the moral shafts of Anna) that what was for Dr. Faustus: Lente lente curite noctis equi- O slowly move the steads of night. In the morning anyway the devil will come and take away the soul, to enter this new world of soulless little imps.

                            Clearly the media and the bhakts were more interested in discussing what goes on in kumar vishwas's bedroom than discussing matters of national importance and governance in delhi, hence the decision by kejriwal to put a stop to all this nonsense, well done kejriwal sir, only you can set straight these sickos

                            This is a law. Should media be allowed to talk rubbish, without a minimum level of credibility? Remember the Daryaganj teacher's story run by Live India and other news channel, if you don't know search on google, which proved wrong later on. Live India was penalized but nobody run that story.<br/><br/>
It ruined that teacher's carrier. Sensationalism and sponsored journalism is the truth of the day and should be opposed. And govt. has invoked a 155 year old law. What's wrong in that? Govt. is going to court against defamation, a valid route if they feel so, how can somebody call it muzzling, only the Bhakts can.<br/>
Who will pay for the expenditure could be debated though.

Supreme Court has taught him lesson and thrown his circular in dust bin.

                            The first half of the column seems to be a self confession by a former TV journalist who did all that he has accused his colleagues of. The second half has a heady mix of snippets of truth mixed with a generous potion of antipathy bordering on jealousy of the PM and the BJP chief. But at no point in the article has Mr. Ashutosh who calls himself a senior journalist with 19 years experience; even put out a single valid argument to justify his party's recent circular to file defamation cases against the media.... their only sin as he himself unwittingly admits did, they did not back support AAP as they used to in the past. Looks more like the ranting's of a jilted lover.

                            Throughout the article the writer has only expressed his rancour on account of news not being in favour of the party he represents. Hence the circular is justified as the media is against them. I thought the circulars of the government are purely impersonal. AAP will now take action against people if they dont like him/her.

                            Sir, I read your full article which you wrote and I feel what you said is very true and Im many others feel the same. <br/>
Many a times I've notice debates being one sided...even when AAP members were attacked with batons in Ahmadabad while AAP tried to defend themselves with their party symbol  - Times Now Portrayed AAP members as villains and BJP as angels - overlooking the fact that the BJP members were already prepared with batons to attack AAP members. <br/>
There are many times which the media has NOT focused on the real issue.<br/>
And I do agree with you, a section of the media is now become biased maybe because of money, allurement or fear.<br/>
But whatever it is the common man are NOT fools and we know which of media channels are hyping up the news and which are not and we will stand for justice at the time of elections and rest assured,  the parties meddling with the media with allurement or whatever will be thrown out - body and soul. You've seen the power of the common man in the Delhi election. This is the power of the common man. We are with you.

As per the argument of paid news, you rode the tide till it suited you. AAP were hailed by the media, portraying Kejriwal as the saviour. Don't bite the hand that rocks your cradle. You are not holy saint your self. <br/>
And for poor Gajendra.. You just watched and blamed his death on Center when it was a publicity stunt gone wrong, and on top those crocodile tears. BJP is bad, Congress pathetic, but AAP is outright disgusting.
