Headline::::Be Warned. Today Greenpeace, Tomorrow You



DateTime::::2015-06-02T15:12:00+05:30




                                To his somewhat startled surprise, Modi has discovered that he can't do in Delhi, as freely as he did in Gandhinagar, all he wants to do and get away with it. For the Constitution that Ambedkar gave us and the democracy that Nehru nurtured have taken such firm roots that Modi, unlike Hitler who overthrew a fragile 14-year old Constitution and the frail democratic Weimar Republic, is confronted in Delhi with the rule of law, a Parliament in which he lacks a majority in the Rajya Sabha, an alert media, and well-established institutions of governance, including, above all, the courts that cannot be trifled with.
 
Thwarted in his efforts to undermine the basic functioning of our democracy in the political and administrative sphere, Modi is now probing the Achilles heel of our democracy - the Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) who have evolved under the umbrella of the Constitution's Fundamental Rights but do not enjoy the protection of any direct reference to them in the Constitution. This is perhaps because, back in 1948-50, when the Constitution was being framed, there were few NGOs. At any rate, they did not loom large on the political horizon. In any case, the Constitution assumed, as it did with Panchayat Raj, that the need for local self-government and an active civil society were so obvious that any special provisions for them in the Constitution were unnecessary.
 
In regard to panchayats, the Constitutional lacuna was filled at Rajiv Gandhi's initiative that led in 1992 to the passing of the two longest amendments to the Constitution (Parts IX and IXA relating respectively to 'The Panchayats' and 'The Municipalities'). It now appears necessary to similarly safeguard, sanctify and sanction NGOs as Modi has begun his assault on unprotected NGOs, making an example, on the one hand, of Teesta Setalvad who bravely continues baiting him on the pogrom in Gujarat in 2002, and, on the other, Greenpeace India that continues with the noble work it has been engaged in for a decade and a half. Teesta is entitled to a column - indeed, an encyclopaedia - on her own. I will here focus on the persecution to which Greenpeace India is being subjected.
 
The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) have charged Greenpeace India, and its affiliate, Greenpeace Environment Trust, with misusing foreign funds and foreigners for "anti-national" activities. MHA apparently regards testifying about India before a meeting abroad as "anti-national". On the other hand, it seems MHA regard it as perfectly patriotic for the Prime Minister to go abroad and claim on foreign soil (once in the presence of a foreign PM) that all Indians were ashamed of being Indian until he, Modi, became PM!  
 
So, in MHA's twisted logic, it is patriotic to lie about India's great past and denigrate everything India has achieved 15 August 1947-26 May 2014, in New York, Sydney, Toronto and Shanghai, but anti-national to explain why Greenpeace India is fighting for displaced tribals, forest dwellers' rights and protection of the environment - all of which is written into the law of the land by the holiest shrine of democracy - our Parliament. Else why did they detain Priya Pillai, a Greenpeace activist, as she attempted to board a flight to London in January this year to address a meeting of those who seek to protect the global environment?
There would appear to be little difference between Rajnath Singh and Rowlatt of the Rowlatt Act, 1919. And, to protect our precious fundamental rights, we will have to fight Rajnath Singh and Modi quite as vigorously as we fought Rowlatt and Lord Reading to protect and promote our freedom and liberty.
 
Standing firmly behind the nation's and the NGO cause are our courts. On 20 January 2015, the Delhi High Court delivered a stinging retort to MHA when it invalidated their order freezing Greenpeace India's accounts in the wake of Pillai's detention, the judge stating in court that MHA's conduct was "arbitrary, illegal, and unconstitutional" (which would be a good way of describing the Rowlatt Act!). On 12 March 2015, Priya Pillai's constitutional right to travel was decisively upheld by the same High Court, Justice Shakhder "rubbishing the reasons given by MHA" against her travel abroad.
 
Nevertheless, the persecution continues. At MHA's instance, the Reserve Bank of India on 23 March 2015 blocked all transfer of funds from the renowned Greenpeace International to Greenpeace India. MHA then followed this up with an order to banks to deep-freeze Greenpeace India's accounts with immediate effect. For the last three months, Greenpeace India have not had access to virtually any funds, domestic or foreign, with which to carry on their good and great work.
 
That is because Modi and Rajnath do not regard Greenpeace India's work as good and great. They regard it as "anti-national" for an Indian NGO, which receives 70 per cent of its funding from Indian sources, to fight for Indian causes that have twice within the first quarter of this year been upheld by the courts as perfectly legitimate and kosher.
Thus, the right to freedom of thought, speech and action is being throttled - only because Greenpeace India's conception of what is in the interest of the Indian people is not the same as that of our suit-boot sarkar. What, after all, is "anti-national" about demanding clean air and safe food, standing up for forest and community rights guaranteed under Indian law, and highlighting the dangers of climate change?
 
At the same time, the Modi-Rajnath duo is running a clandestine smear campaign against Greenpeace India. They thus seek to silence criticism and dissent - which are the blood stream of democracy, in India if not under the Gujarat of Narendra Modi. They claim to have conducted an "investigation" last year into Greenpeace India's affairs, but even six months after the submission of that "intelligence" report - which seems prima facie to be wanting in that one quality - those arraigned are not being given access to the dossier on the specious ground that the report is "secret". This is similar to the grounds on which the Prime Minister's wife is being denied information that is hers of right under the Right to Information Act.
 
Some of Greenpeace India's domestic accounts have been frozen although the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) has nothing to do with domestic donations. International experts who have visited Greenpeace India on valid visas are being defamed and prevented from again lending their valuable services. Bogus claims of Greenpeace India endangering India's "economic security" are being bruited about. Blatant lies are being spread by and on behalf of the government regarding a foreign TV programme about a proposed British investment in a mine project in India. What if not a smear campaign is this by a jackbooted government? Be warned. First an NGO. Next - YOU!(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            For a change, why don't you write what you as yourself, have achieved in your whole 4 decades of public life instead of chanting what your master family did in 6 decades? Sycophancy will only make a person kneel down Mr Mani,it will never let you hold your head high. OK, Modi could not do in Delhi what he did in Gandhinagar. The difference however is, he had less idiotic, ganged up, crooked and disruptive opposition like yours for his developmental projects. My response to your fancy blog titled "today green peace tomorrow you" is, better remember what has already happened to you yesterday..

Media is doing a great job but with allegations of media being paid, anytime Media can go silent. People be aware!!! lest we lose our rights which have been won with great sacrifice from our ancestors.

Certainly,  your Adani's, Shah's, Ambani's and Patel's will not benefit, well that's totally fine look at the larger picture.. And the Indian growth story, You definitely don't deserve the credit (atleast yet). An amazing piece by MSA! Very much appreciated.. It's been a year and the acche din PM has not had a single press conference, apart from the multiple one side talk shows, clearly goes on to show his mettle to deal with criticism.

                            Sir, first of all, tell me in 2013 when the GOI under congress charged Greenpeace with anti development activities, where were you? MHA has acted upon the charges laid down by the UPA government in 2013, and now you blame modi and Rajnath singh for the same. Much like RaGa blaming the Modi government for shutting down the food park in amethi, when it was the UPA government which had not started the project for four years and later deemed it not feasible to do so. Modi government only sent out the notification for the judgement made by UPA. And you have the guts to openly lie and fool the people of India. Is this what Democracy is?<br/>
As far as constitution is concerned, Greenpeace India has used more than 60% of its Foreign funding for administrative expenses, where as the law (enacted by the congress) says that they cannot use more than 50% of their expenses for administrative use. Why did not the UPA govt change this when they were so concerned about the Greenpeace.

                            Since May 2014, every article that Mani has written is about bashing Modi. He also takes the names of &amp; praises Nehru, Indira, Rajiv, Sonia &amp; Rahul Gandhi. That is the essence of what he writes. <br/><br/>
Modi is not a mahatma, we all know that. He has his flaws, insecurities &amp; will take revenge on some organisations using his clout as PM. Same things were done by Sonia for the past 10 years and even now when Uttarakhand scam came out, the Gandhi's disappeared into some hole. What sort of leader's disappear during crisis letting their partymen handle the crisis? Just so they are insulated from the effects of the scam? Just because their image should not be tarnished? When will this joker write an article on these so called 'leaders'? And yes when will this fellow write an article about the Uttarakhand scam?

                            Only complete fools and gullible or fanatical fascistic supporters of BJP will disagree with Shri Mani Shankar Aiyar's analysis. <br/><br/>
His warnings about the real disasters which can occur due to authoritarian, dictatorial, illegal,  immoral and evil-minded misdeeds  of Modi led BJP government are real.    <br/><br/>
Decent people staying quite over Modi led government victimising The Green Peace India will live to regret if they fail to come to their senses even after reading the last few words of M.S Aiyar's article i.e "Be warned. First an NGO. Next -- YOU"<br/><br/>
All those who care about India but are not standing in solidarity with Green Peace and other victims of Modi regime should learn from what Niemoller wrote after surviving close shave with Hitler's Nazis: 'First they came for the socialists and I didn't speak out because I wasn't socialist. Then they came for trade unionists and I didn't speak out because I wasn't trade unionist. Then they came for Jews and I didn't speak out because I wasn't Jew. Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me'. <br/><br/>
So those who ignore constant real and serious warnings  by regular critic of Modi, the fearless  Aiyar will live to regret.

                            Mr. Aiyar lost his seat from Mayiladuthurai in 2014 and lost his deposit (came in 4th). Then he got nominated, yes, nominated and not elected to the Rajya Sabha.  Clearly has little understanding of India or his home state of Tamil Nadu.  Has been voicing largely irrelevant views so someone in the Congress party will take notice and reward him with another term in parliament.  For him, regrettably they have bigger problems.  His Rajya Sabha term ends in early 2016.  Good riddance!

                            Poor Aiyer! Waiting to pounce on Modi to prove his loyalty to his Italian masters. Shame on you. Don't you know that you are supposed to be an Indian? And why are you suddenly concerned about Greenpeace? You have never written about them earlier, good or bad, and now you are their staunch defender? It is for the Government to decide whether Greenpeace's activities are anti-national or not. And for the Court to decide whether the Government was right or not. This is common place. So what is your problem? Feeling ignored that nobody, even in the Congress, considers you anything more than a antique gasbag? So letting go now and then to get some relief? Life is not fair. What to do?

                            Every right wing government in the history of time uses patriotism to further their own agenda. Everything said against them is anti-national and against national interest, that is how they barge in policies that favor corporates and make disadvantaged people poor and landless.

                            Considering every time fearlessly outspoken Mani Shankar Aiyar's articles apper on line the whole of the Snakepit starts spewing their pro BJP venom is the perfect proof that he has only told the truth, which hurts those badly who support immoral and often illegal evil actions of BJP government led by Modi. This website also is not neutral because often comments submitted which may be critical of establishment and strongly oppose Modi do not get displayed.

The constipated character of Bhaskor would have been best played by this flatulent gentleman Mr. Many Sanka (omitting "r" purposefully) Iyer. He writes as if he is always irritated by his severe constipation and tries to find fault with Modi for it. Please search elsewhere - not Modi, not this world is the cause of your problem Mr.Iyer - it's you &amp; you alone! By the way, drink lots of water, sleep well, stay away from CONgress &amp; don't write. You'll be alright. We pray for your wellbeing!

                            Always enjoyed reading his articles, Very good.Every week I always make it point to read the articles written by a few  good , clear thinking people.One of them is Mr,Mani Shanket Aiyer, I am surprised at the venom that is spewed in this column.The respectful language we use show the culture of our up bringng.No need to call names like idiot ,moron sycophant etc.Words which we wouldnt use to his face we shouldnt  use behind his back.Its like stabbing a person in the back.All of you, Mr Modi admirers cannot seem to see the real things happening in our country, So you may be the ones who needs to introspect and learn the truth.A person who is loyal to his leader especially during hard times is to be respected, BJP has welcomed disloyal people from other parties to join them.Most of them ,,.the top <br/>
ones had serious crimes against them..Yet all of them have beem acquited ...the latest being JJ...She has sold her soul to the BJP.and traded her support for her freedom.Congress has made some mistakes in the past but they did great things too. BJP may promise Great things but if its at the cost of the poor people it will not prosper,..for it is said  the cries of the poor and the shed blood of innocents laments before the throne of God...and retribution comes.So please do not be blind...Read learned peoples articles of different affiliations and learn to judge prahmatically,<br/>
Thanks for your articles.They are good.

                            One thing I really do not understand is, what is this great work that was done by greenpeace that is being highlighted by the author. Why do they need to testify to foreign govts or agencies to bring about a change in our country and if so when has that happened? It is true that our tribals and oppressed castes need a lot of help, but that's not going to come from anywhere from within. MSA is heavily biased author who conveniently ignores truth to make his points sound intelligent along with a regular nauseating dose of the Nehru Rajiv obsession, so I don't take him seriously.

                            Mani and his team are not used to change. The present structure and systems only favours 10% of the populations and because of which in the last 65 years this country has given poverty and inhuman living conditions to millions of Indians. Lot of south Asian countries have improved their living conditions with good infrastructure and utilities for their people. <br/><br/>
We in India are good in debate and opinion but do not have  convictions to work for betterment of our society. Every politician and NGO are in the business for getting money and power and not necessarily (Seva for the masses).<br/><br/>
We need to change this 180 degree , or we will be the poorest country in the world soon with fast natural resources and people strength.<br/><br/>
Thanks to People like 'Mani'  , who have got us this far. Do nto get confused with our living conditions when you read this as we are only 15% of the populations where 85% have to struggle to live a dignity. <br/><br/>
Modi is changing this to give security to poor people with pesions and insurance. He is also trying to have factories and economic activities near their home with land accusations for rural development.<br/><br/>
I am now in China and you will be amassed here as no body is interested in free speech and democracy as they get world class infrastructure, good living conditions, clean roads and lighting everywhere. People need good life which they are getting but we in India got only debates and talks all these years ( 65 to be precise) and thanks to narrow minded politicians and leaders who get us here.

By the way stop quoting some non-sense names and years of past where those people where they lived have developed their counties and today we are begging from them for knowledge and expertise, tehnology, these non-sensical and biased NGOs created by them and thier super companies so that other countries should not grow.<br/><br/>
Maniji you are living in the past... come on... even Rajiv gandhi would have kept quite the way people of india reduced you to rubble. grow up show some grace. let modiji carry on his work good or bad nobody questioning his honest way of developing the country, I think it is golden opportunity for India and your grand-grand son's future.

                            Excellent article! If the govt has reservations against some of the NGO activities, it can fight them legally. That's what courts are for. They're trying to bring in sweeping changes at their whims and fancies. And even after the court's wrapping its knuckles, they can't stop. Opposition to hate speeches, ghar wapsi programs, and now against their attempts to curtail the IIT Madras study group, Modi is slowing beginning to realize what true democracy is all about.

Only people knows who are working with them. Don't worry, all are free in democracy to speak. If something is unjustified, keep on writing to influence the mass. It will work. Unfortunately, 'chiwala remark' has change the political scene in india. Dont underestimate the power of common man, people are intelligent enough and let them decide by whom to get influenced.

Whenever you or anyone tells a truth that is uncomfortable to the BJP or the Sangh Parivar, these battery of zestful supports divert the topic and take the topic into another direction. Another tactic used by these zestful supporters is to do character assassination of any person seen as a threat to their ideology. How predictive these guys are.

                            That Mr.Iyer is able to write all his crap &amp; publish on NDTV is a sign that dissenting voices are not muzzled today. It's a different matter that people don't (can't!!???) read beyond the headlines of what trash he writes and come straight to comments section for some good entertainment.

                            Forty years ago Indira Gandhi tried to muzzle the nation; Modi-Rajnath is trying to do the same today. So what's new? It doesn't matter what colour they wear, all politicians are the same, their rhetorics are the same, their greeds are the same, their hunger for power is the same. Anyone blocking their way is an enemy to national interest. Let's face it, it's their personal interest that is at stake and they don't want anyone messing it up.

                            So, Mani has already given his verdict on Guj riots and branded Modi as culprit and Teesta as the savior.. what a crap.. For me, I was not ashamed to be an Indian before Modi came to power... But now I am proud to be an Indian under Modi's rule..

                            I know Mani shall not read it, forget replying. He is a know stooge of Italian Amma n Rahul (who is borne to rule). But can any body elaborate:<br/>
1. What form of democracy Nehru nurtured by forcing himself to be PM when he was thrased out by his party 1-14 in favour of Patel?<br/>
2. What form of democracy Mani represents, when he is CHOOSEN as nominated member of Rajya Sabha by the Amma as a reward to licking her boots?<br/>
3. What form of law is adhered to by NGOs who had been commmented adversely upon by IB report initiated during UPA regime?<br/>
4. What form of law is being adhered to by NGOs when they mix foreign and Indian contributions despite fact that such accounting is forbidden by law?

                            Mr. Mani, what is it that motivates you to write on NDTV forum? Don't you ever read the responses to your articles? The army of saffron brigade would start calling you names now and lot of abuses as well. No logic, no reason just plain simple stupid stuff. Come on Bhakts, start at once...
