Headline::::'India's Daughter Banned?' It Should be Compulsory Viewing



DateTime::::2015-03-04T21:45:00+05:30



Shobhaa De is an established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator, who is considered an authority on popular culture.
	 
	Rajnath Singh  has missed the point... and lost the plot.
	Come on, Mr. Home Minister , what exactly are you "furious" about? That the world will soon know what our men in India think of us - the women of this country? Or that India will get a 'bad name' internationally, thanks to the documentary aptly titled "India's Daughter"? Rajnath Singh is worried about the "embarrassment" the documentary will cause to our Bharat Mahaan, where women are compared to exposed sweets left by the roadside for dogs to attack (this priceless quote comes from ML  Sharma, one of the defence lawyers handling the Nirbhaya case).
	Just look at the irony of it all. Instead of acknowledging the gravity of the situation and promising to tackle crimes against women on a war footing, the Home Minister is diverting attention from the tragedy itself and concentrating on prison procedures (who granted permissions to the crew to shoot inside the infamous Tihar jail? Why?).  
	Instead, shouldn't Rajnath's fury be reserved for the lack of political will in tackling rape and related acts of brutality against women of our country? If he cannot address the real issues, he should step back from getting involved and finding convenient scapegoats, like the film-maker or those seeking to broadcast the documentary.
	Will banning the documentary achieve anything? Stop future rapes? There is no face left to save in any case. The international community is aware of  India's shame and openly labels Delhi the 'rape capital of the  world'.
	59- year-old  producer ("East is East") Leslee Udwin's expose, shot over two years, merely highlights ghastly truths about our rabid, anti-women society. When Mukesh Singh, the driver of the killer bus, blatantly tells his interviewer," censored by authorities" (censored by authorities) Yes. It's that grim.
	Mukesh issues a direct threat when he says,"censored by authorities" (censored by authorities)
	   
	Advocate ML Sharma states brazenly, "Indian culture is the best culture (right! Tell us about it!). In our culture there is no place for a woman." Shocked? I'm not! Once again, I can visualize millions of heads nodding in agreement. Leslee Udwin, armed with 50 questions, and assisted by a psychologist, interviewed eight criminals inside Tihar Jail. She herself was a rape victim, she says, in an effort to explain her strong motivation to make this particular documentary. Instead of anger, she experienced a "sense of overwhelming pity" for the brutes, she admits, because ".... we live in a world where women are treated in such a degraded and depraved manner."
	Udwin must be a really evolved woman to rationalize her feelings in this manner. I felt waves of unbridled rage, indescribable revulsion and a deep sense of loathing reading Udwin's interviews. When she added, "What they (sex criminals) have in common is the belief that women are of a lesser value.  They feel that if women break restrictions men have imposed on them, it is a reason to attack them."
	ML Sharma's responses bolster Udwin's theory. He blames Nirbhaya's parents squarely when he says, "Why did they send her with anyone that late at night? He wasn't her boyfriend. Is it not parents' responsibility to keep an eye on where she goes and with whom?" Mukesh also echoes the opinions of many men when he says,"censored by authorities ""(censored by authorities)
	A "decent" girl  should not be out at 9 p.m. That's the cut- off limit for establishing a woman's decency - get it? Men's indecency does not come into the picture at all - regardless of time.
	These are arguments one hears over and over again. Blame the parents. Blame the victim. Blame movies. Blame music. Blame clothes. Blame alcohol. Blame cigarettes.  Blame night clubs. Blame , blame , blame. Assume zero responsibility. Do nothing.
	Punish the victims - but not too severely ( the underage criminal who raped Nirbhaya  will be roaming the streets and stalking  other  victims  just three years from now). The other two, Akash Thakur and Pawan Prabhu, displayed no remorse when confronted on camera, and calmly pointed out that the same levels of brutality  were committed in the Rohtaak and Barabanki sex crimes. Almost as if that's "normal".
	This has got to be the most chilling aspect of the documentary - the  absence of guilt and regret on any level. Men who can stare straight into the camera and say, "She asked for it!" Or worse, "She deserved it!" And even more worse, "We will do it again... and again... because women need to be taught a lesson."
	What if women block their ears, minds and hearts... and refuse to conform to diktats?
	What happens to women who dare to dream, laugh, go out, have fun, have a drink. Women who have ambitions, work hard, get ahead in life.
	Women with minds. Women who value their many freedoms.
	Such women are dangerous to society. Such women must be fixed. With rods, nails, chains and ropes. Play by 'their' rules. Or, pay the price.
	For if women are not shown their place, men will become irrelevant. How can any society handle that - men being rendered irrelevant?
	Perhaps Rajnath Singh has the answers.
	'India's Daughter' must be made compulsory viewing in our schools, colleges and government offices.
	Because if there is one thing any society that calls itself civilized must not shun, it is the truth.
	Rajnath Singh - hold up a mirror. See what's going on around you. Deal with it. The real 'embarrassment' India needs to confront is its own horrific reality... and the shame that goes with it.

                            Indian public goes crazy even before they understand what is happening , I think everyone should just take a step back and introspect what is happening. What the rapist said was the mindset of society , men and even women in our country . why is everyone trying to kill the messenger instead of listing to the message and finding a solution  @least changing there attitude !!!!

                            Since its become a no holds barred controversy, maybe someone should do an interview with the wives and family of the defense lawyers. That should give us an insight into the other side of the profession. <br/>
How  come in all such cases where the defense is for such ghastly acts, we have not heard of the wives filing for separation...does it mean that these wives have such a high threshold of endurance for thekind of activities that their husbands defend...

                            Thank you Shobha De for writing this. I couldn't agree more. I hope every one of our MPs reads this. Everyone in our society reads this. I hope this message reaches everyone in the Govt and elsewhere who can effect a change ".. if there is one thing any society that calls itself civilized must not shun, it is the truth.........The real 'embarrassment' India needs to confront is its own horrific reality... and the shame that goes with it."<br/>
Things are so bad when it comes to the mindset people have, that sometimes I feel that nothing short of a revolution can change it. Indians are born and raised with the belief that men are superior and women need to be controlled. It may sound harsh, but 'Indian culture' as it is today is embarrassing. We grew up hearing about the greatness of our 'culture'. We believed it. As an adult when I think about it, I don't understand where the greatness is? Sure, in a good family we respect our elders, look after each other, and talk politely. But so does every other civilized society in the world. That is a mark of civilization, not Indianness. We gloat over our 'culture' thinking it is unique. It is not. And it is definitely not one that is superior to any other in the civilized world. Anyone who has experienced life in other civilized and modern societies knows that we are more uncivilized than most. Look at how the Indian public behaves in crowded places, at bus/train stations, markets, streets. Look at how men stare...like animals, and poke and grab women in crowded buses. A majority of Indian men think that women are to be used, they may not have the guts to say that, but that is what they think. It is time for a reality check...Indian culture today is a major embarrassment, something that needs fixing.<br/><br/>
And politicians – please be not concerned about how this documentary is going to affect tourism. Be concerned about the women in our country…..before that.

                            I agree with Shobha De that truth should not be hhidden.But we don't want to give airtime for these thugs who have no remorse or conscience.  Its enough to know   that they are not remorseful. We don't have to see it on camera. All criminals try and justify their crimes. Who cares about what they say.

                            I am not a big fan of Shobha De as a writer/commentator. Most of her commentary is not good (in my humble opinion). But this one is spot on and bang on target. This interview of the ill-bred thugs must be able to shock us - and shock us so deeply that we immediately rush out of the comfort zone and build up an environment of equality and justice.<br/>
As for the culprits, they are pronounced guilty and our judiciary will deal with it. I only hope it is not delayed much.<br/>
And for this interview - it only reflects what a lot of people think. This is the sad part and we have to rise. Banning the broadcast of the interview is like solving the symptoms and hiding the root cause.

                            Here's the thing Ms De, the parents hold the key as to whether or not the documentary should be shown. Sure, you want "the world to know about Indian men", but not at the expense of their daughter if they are not comfortable about it. Period.<br/>
Also kindly stop generalizing the "mindset of Indian men". If you interview a person who is filthy enough to commit such an act, you are asking for filth, and then you will use it to stereotype Indian men. And remember, filth is there everywhere, not just in this country!

                            The HM appears more interested in protecting the rapists. The irony of the fact is that it took the SC who had showed overreaching activism in recent years took more than a year to decide on this open and shut case.

It is not going to change mentality and will generalise that all indian think like that, which is rubbish. This is view of a mentally retarded guy. He must have been brought by a woman who think low of herself. He was challenged by a real woman during that rape event which he cannot tolerate.

                            As usual, Shobha De is right on the money with this one. The documentary only confirms the depraved male mentality. Mr Rajnath Singh would be better of trying to find out why the fast track approach has got derailed in this case. Two years on , and the matter is stuck in SC. While the SC can give urgent hearings to Jayalalitha and N Srinivasan, it seems to be oblivious to the rage felt by the society in this dastardly crime. <br/><br/>

                            The film actually opens up an opportunity for the society and individuals to do an introspection and plan for  corrective course of action for one of the grave ills that ails our contemporary society. Banning them film is like ignoring the elephant in the room and missing out on what promised to be an opportunity to do Introspection and Course Correction. Surprisingly, rapes can't be banned, rapes scenes in movies are not banned but a harmless documentary is being banned on flimsy grounds

In place of taking inspiration to provide effective and timely justice and how to change mindset politicians are as usual politicize and ban it.

                            The lawyers Sharmna and Singh should be struck off by their professional body.  As officers of the Court, they are obligated to carry out their duties in accordance with the Constitution which includes treating all Indians (and that includes women) as equal citizens.  The rapist looked to me like a well fed thug raring to get out and commit the same offence again.  When a slum dweller from Bihar can get away with such a rape in the capital city of India, and live a happy life in Tihar, India needs to think urgently and put to death such scum.

                            Home minister should accept responsibility on how Indian men view women. There is clearly something wrong in how we bring up a male child in our society. Suggest govt to kindly do a survey and find how many men think (and possibly act when given an opportunity) like Rapist Mukesh Singh and fellow convicts. And then work towards addressing the root cause whilst giving out strong punishment to all rapists to deter others from committing the heinous offence.

As a woman, I too want that the BBC film must be seen by short-sighted lawmakers and administrators of India, for Indian society to badger them about taking brutal criminals like rapists seriously- much more seriously than they do now-  and giving them immediate and long-lasting punishment.<br/>
Just a few very ugly and obscene expressions used by the rape-interviewee may be left out, but the horror of it all must be brought in front of the nation, in front of thick-skinned, low-mentality men, till people blast them with a demand for extreme punishment to brutal, barbaric men committing crimes on women.

                            I watched this documentary on the You Tube and strongly feel it should be banned from telecast. I am in favour of freedom of speech. I am more concerned about its potential negative repurcussions: seeing these rapists on national television, many men would be motivated to indulge in such criminal activities just to gain his "5 minutes of fame" by being seen on the television which would not be possible otherwise. Importantly, Indian courts should take suo motu cognizance of defence lawyers unprofessional utterances against woman and permanently revoke their license to practice law. If educated professional people like this hold this type of views, then God bless our country.

Honestly, I feel the government felt they needed to do something on this AND the only thing they can do it BAN it. And start a witch hunt on the makers and policies etc. <br/><br/>
Well its called putting your head in sand (closing your eyes) and hoping the problem will go away.<br/><br/>

It is clear that in future under this and any other Indian government  truth will be suppressed and people will hear only what likes of Rajnath Singh wants them to..total control over everything, we know what is good for the country and society..total dictatorship.

                            The documentary has been released on BBC website few hours ago, i just finished watching it.<br/>
There is absolutely nothing which warrants banning it, its so plain, it doesn't even make sense why some are so worked up over it.<br/><br/>
This is another instance proving that Modi has surrounded himself with idiots.

                            All men are same, at least in India!! So let's kill all men. Then only India will become free!! Is it ?? Criminals are criminals. View them as criminal, not as Men, Hindu, Muslim, Poor, rich. These criminals will be sentenced. Delay is questionable (always) but can that be barometer for all Men? All businessmen, corporates are criminal, all politician criminal, all Govt. employees are criminal, corrupt, thief. ... is this what our India is made up of ?? Everyone is thief, that's what general belief or opinion is expressed here. Not only by Ms. De but all who commented. Rage, outrage, public anger.... painting each and every person in the class or section of an individual criminal with same brush, is what we believe. Wonderful  !!! Or Shameful ??!! Depends on which side of social media you are. Please have balanced view. For God sake.

                            It is shameful that government and some people including some media does not want to show the reality of animal instinct of a man. India proclaim itself a free and democratic country and it should prove to be so otherwise it is a sham. some unbiased people should first see it and if there are some really objectionable matter or scenes those can be cut.

                            Why are indians making a mockery of theme selves infront of the whole world and insulting themselves. I guess this comes out  from their self hating nature and slave and inferior mentality. Does this lady not have a father or brother who loved and cared and took care of her. How the words of a pervert rapistt have become the words of the male society of India.? We made India as a rapistt country. Now if an indian girl is seen outside India, people may ask how many times she was rapped. There are serial killers, and rapistts, cannibals and mass murderers of 5 to 6 year school kids and brutal sycopaths in western and many other developed countries. Even after the 10s of school shottings in US , nobdoy says US is not safe for school kids. India is not even in top numbers in terms of rape but many western countries are in top 10. In allmost all western countries and developed asian countries there are many dangerous places and times and almost all people are educated in crime prevention. A girl is not safe at 12 midnight in India and A girl or a boy is not safe at 12 midnight in any so called developed country. We dont see any documentaries and media blitz on the 100s of syco paths who are in jails in countries like US and many more western countries. Looks like there is conspiracy to shame and defame India and stop its growth and some of our media is helping in that mission. with freedom comes responsibility also and looks like Indians want only freedom to do what ever and pass the responsibility to govt. It's like saying i will jump into the lion's den and govt has the responsibility to stop the lion from eating me. Instead of focusing on this case where the culprits are already punished, the media and others if they have any responsibility should educate Indians on taking crime preventive measures. The govt can not be in each and every corner at any time, The people have the responsibility to take preventive measures also. In most western and developed countries, they have seen worst cases than this case and this incident will not happen because there people are educated not to travel or go with strangers and take public transport system.

                            Being a person of Indian origin residing abroad such as in Canada like me, I have a different perspective to airing this 'controversial documentary'. No doubt this documentary would make every watcher condemn the opinion or remarks made by Mukesh Singh. But please just think what would be the take-away message by the people from developed nations (say, Canadians, Americans and Europeans) after they watch this documentary. I am so sure that they would all think that India as a nation is filled with 'slum dogs' and men with rapist mentality and disrespect for women. This take-home message forms a 'blanket statement' about all Indians living in India as well as outside. The 'slum dog millionaire' movie has already caused ample embarrassment and damage to all the so far earned 'Indian' image for us here. Now that Mr. Modi has forced developed countries to rethink 'good' about Indians with his charismatic image and trying to get the growth engine back on track, this documentary would likely embarrass us again instead of conveying the genuine message of the documentary. Some of these politicians, columnists and journalists who are now criticizing the 'ban' may need to be ready to feel ashamed or embarrassed when travel abroad. Tourism sector seems likely to incur some losses. Just imagine if an Indian film maker goes to a developed country and picks up a socially demeaning topic and makes a film, I would doubt that any such country with REAL patriotic people would ever allow its publication. Like it or not, so, I along with many others of my view proudly stand by the Indian Govt's stand of banning this documentary. <br/>
India needs to wonder as to why do these foreign film makers get attracted to India to make movies like 'slum dog', 'India's daughter' and others when such incidents do happen in their countries too and in fact, in some places, deliberately not or under reported. Ironically, some Indian film makers pick up some Indian issues (embarrassing) and make movies such as 'water' and others to compete for internatnal awards.

                            If we are sensitive to such issues and we think we are right in been sensitive to such societal problems, then its our duty to sensitize others. This documentary does that. We Indians have a sense of honour and pride... but honor is in facing the truth...  hiding the truth for honor is no honor.. India is not a kind of country which will be defamed by such a documentary... <br/><br/>

                            Rajnath must know that "Facts do not disappear by closing the eyes". The move to ban the documentary is a foolish and retrograde. Let people know, realize and appreciate the gravity of the matter.<br/><br/>
You can't Clean India without knowing how much muck is there. Let the muck be known to all by throwing it to people's eyes and not hide it under the carpet.<br/><br/>
By the way, if you listen to the rapist's retrograde and stereotype role of woman in the society it sounds as if some pracharak of Rajnath's parent cultural oraganization is giving sermons about how woman should conduct themselves - in what kind of dresses, in company of what kind of people and on the road up to what time etc.<br/><br/>
Is this the reason why Rajnath wants a ban on the documentary, because it exposes the cultural backwardness and bankruptcy of his parent and brother sister cultural organizations like RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal, Hindu Sene ........... There are countless heads of the cultural Ravan, which is Rajnath's opinion is the patron and protector of Hindu culture.

                            Dont men have the "tools" to rape women in other parts of the world? Are women not being raped in other countries? In particular, are women not raped in Britain? Why is this British woman trying to portray every Indian man as a rapist and why should she do this documentary based on an Indian girl and an Indian animal rapist? She could have done it elsewhere and got slippered for it. Just because the congress govt, especially Sushil Kumar Shinde and his team, gave the filmmaker the permission without caring to know what she would be doing, how commercially she would exploit the incompetence of the then UPA govt, etc., how could anyone go about defaming or helping the accused explain in explicit detail how he went about outraging the modesty of an innocent girl and killing her too! This is an issue which even the "aliens" would vomit upon. There are some activists, columnists and filmmakers in India who would want the documentary aired because they wanted to know and show the public the "mindset the rapist has" during the time of the actual crime. How nauseous can this be? I hope a girl of whatever age, right from 3 to God knows what age, from the family of these people who want this film to be aired, be raped, almost killed, and then giving the chance to the rapist to explain how he did it on national television under the glare of the entire Indian public, even mentioning the relationship between the victim and the columnist/activist/filmmaker/politician as to how he went about his job raping the girl. I would like to see their faces when this is being aired. We concede that rape happens every day in India, but to glorify the accused and take his version on graphic description of the crime is utterly condemnable. The BBC documentary maker acts as though there is never a crime committed in UK. If she is so committed to knowing the mindset of criminals, why does she not go with her camera and retinue to the part of the Arab world where people of all nationalities are being shot point blank on camera or beheaded and those tapes being sent to the respective embassies. What does this British filmmaker think of those "mindsets?" Ask her to find out their "mindsets" too before airing this interview with Mukesh if she has the guts to do so. ISIS would be too happy to make a meal out of her....Hypocrisy is one of the things the British gave us before they left India and we or some of us like the indian filmmaker, columnist, politician and activist shamelessly still practice and swear by it. Disgusting even more when these people call it "freedom of expression." Our founding fathers would have kicked them on their faces for their interpretation of our fundamental rights. I hope this message goes loud and clear.....thanks only to NDTV if it decided to carry this message. If not, I would not whine like the activists/columnists/politicians/filmmakers etc.

                            I also was opposed to the idea of this documentary. But on second thought, this documentary does show the ugly but truthful side of our society. The documentary clearly shows that the problem of rape, is till prevalent due to the ingrained mentality that women are beneath men. This doco challenges us to look deep within, and finds that the answer to healing us is with ourselves only. A society in which women themselves are involved in instilling in their children that the female sex is undesired for as a child, and to owned like an animal, when a spouse.<br/><br/>
The irony is that a majority of men in India (I'm a guy) think around the same lines. Many voices are being raised against this doco as suddenly you see a rapist voicing his thinking, and other men are shocked as thats the same opinion that they have, and are disgusted by a rapist having the same mentality.<br/><br/>
Its nothing but guilt talking when they ask for a ban on this

                            I watched the documentary and found that it had a very powerful message. It seems that in India, for the vast majority,  neither position nor poverty seem to matter when it comes to the status of women. Whether it comes to picking up the dirtied plates after the men of the household have finished a large meal, or getting a chance to air views on world matters, women seem to take a second place in both heart and hearth. I am appalled, truly appalled. The lawyers only spoke what a majority of men in India feel. I am ashamed that our country has banned a movie that is a reflection of the sullied thought of the Indian male. As a woman, I celebrate spirit and spunk of the Indian woman. I pray that we have more role models in India, and I hope channels like NDTV give more women a chance to speak up. And speak out.

                            Before we can consider Shobhaa De's elegant (as usual) endorsement of the line of the producers of India's Daughter against the ban on it in India, we need answers to a few questions: 1. What is the proof that rapist Mukesh's responses were not tutored or pre-scripted by Leslee Udwin or the actual interviewer Dibang, or both? Don't we need to watch the 5 hour 50 minute portions of Dibang's six hour conversation that were edited out? 2. Ditto, for the interviews with the two misguided lawyers who have defended Mukesh. 3. We are being asked "if Nirbhaya's parents have no objection to the film, why are others agitated". But is this argument not akin to the 'blood money' provision in some Middle Eastern Laws under which the relatives of a victim can forgive the perpetrator for appropriate compensation. After all, the parents must have received a hefty amount for appearing in the film, considering that Mukesh was paid Rs 40,000 for his interview! 4. Does Shobhaa De agree with Leslee Udwin's action in revealing Nirbhaya's name to the whole world, whereas we in India have scrupulously attempted to keep her identity a secret?  5. Why is Mukesh's address shown as Jhuggi 49, Ravidas Camp, RK Puram Sector 3, New Delhi, in his ‘contract' with the producer of the film, who is appropriately named ‘Assassin Films', instead of as Tihar Jail? Is it to enable the ‘blood money' for the interview to be paid out to the rapist's mother, who must have been separately paid by Udwin for her piece in the film? I hope Shobhaa De will enlighten us on these queries.

                            Are Indians angry because foreigners are watching the documentary? Why should we worry about what others think? Is prestige abroad more important that reality of India? Thousands of women are being abused, raped and killed daily isn't that important?  Yes the world now knows that 250 sitting MPs are charged with such crimes and nothing can be done about it. The reality is India is still not a real democracy, where British style Raj still continues. We the citizens are totally powerless and are unable to question our public servants. Once elected they become our lords and masters. Politicians charged with corruption are walking free enjoying their loot and may never ever be convicted. Unless and until we Indians become the true masters of our democracy, we can not expect the world to respect us.. Why worry about what others say, let us clean up our own homes and stand with our heads high. The rest of the world can go to hell.

                            Are we Indians angry because foreigners are watching the documentary? Why should we worry about what others think? Is prestige abroad more important that reality of India? Thousands of women are being abused, raped and killed daily isn't that important?  Yes the world now knows that 250 sitting MPs are charged with such crimes and nothing can be done about it. The reality is India still is not a real democracy, where British style Raj still continues. We the citizens are totally powerless and are unable to question our public servants. Once elected they become our lords and masters. Politicians charged with corruption are walking free enjoying their loot and may never ever be convicted. Unless and until we Indians become the true masters of our democracy, we can not expect the world to respect us.. Why worry about what others say, let us clean up our own homes and stand up with our heads held high. The rest of the world can go to hell.

                            The hue and cry has created too much of a sound, discussions and debates have consumed much time and the reality is, problem of rape is stranded.<br/>
The enormity of human behavior and short coming can not be fathomed and it is an addition in that direction of such dimension of human mind.And it can not be ignored.<br/>
Better we equip ourselves to deal with such evil thoughts, that is simply what comes to my mind.

                            What I found particularly horrifying were the views of the two defence lawyers.  Educated men, senior members of the Indian legal profession, expressed the opinion that it was okay to commit violence and murder if the victim was female.

                            The author had said it mildly. It must be shown in all the theaters free at Govt cost to arouse our conscience to respect women as our mothers in whose wombs we formed and came out. Most hypocrites of the world, we the Indians let us awake. We pray Lakshmi, Saraswathi and maa Durga while we treat them as subhuman in reality. We venerate Ramayan where the hero send his pious wife to forests on the word of a scoundrel. In another the King gambles his wife in a game of dice and we call him as Dharmathma. We allow all dirty cinemas where a boy chases a girl and treat him as hero, what the youngsters are supposed to learn from it? What a horrible nation.

                            The author is very mild.We Indians are the worst hypocrites in the entire world. On the one hand we Pray Goddess Parwathi, Lakshmi and Saraswathi as even more important than their consorts and at the same time treat women as semi human. We have puranas where one Hero sends his wife to forests simply because one scoundrel said some nonsense and one kings gambles his wife and adore them.We forget that every woman is a fantastic creation of God to produce an offspring in her womb and man to support her in her divine duty. There is nothing in that film except that it arouses our conscience to our depravity.

                            From An Indian man who has lived in India<br/><br/>
I think a lot of Indians need to bear some sort of responsibility for the atrocious act. Many parents in India (especially the north half where it is worse than the south) raise boys differently compared to girls. There are given extra attention, extra love, even extra food at times, all at the expense of the young girl. They grow up feeling entitled, that they are better than women and women are just mere objects. Even when the parents die they give their land and possessions all to the son, while the girls are married off and in the "possesion" of their new husband's. So this comes to me as no surprise. This upbringing has led to many men in india being chauvinistic and misogynisitic. Heck, some girls have their education careers cut in favour of the son. (Now I know I shouldn't generalize all Indian men are bad and that we have hugely diverse country with 32 official languages and whatever 56 religions and all that jazz) but this patriarchy exists in many parts of India. I find it hard to defend India anymore and even harder to call this an isolated incident even though there are hundreds of millions of good men in India. <br/><br/>
Another thing is that laws don't do anything in India. So that really would not cause a shift. The implementation of laws of any kind by police officers or authority in India is poor. Mass re-edication is required, starting with empowering girls.

                            The ban on the documentary by India is a better advertisement for the whole world to watch the horrors of the so called, ''emerging superpower.'' I assure you, now more people are aware of what's happening here in India over this issue, while our Home Minister was so graciously trying to avoid the exact embarrassment.

                            A BJP MPs says we need programs in schools where kids are taught to respect women....but what about all those thousands of government run schools for the poor? I would urge you to visit just one govt/municipal school in India and see how pathetic the conditions are. We have traveled through rural areas of north India where the schools were not functioning. The villagers told that teachers seldom show up. The official in charge doesn't care and probably pockets money allotted to the school. The CMs don't care either. We have generations of frustrated youth growing up undereducated and underemployed roaming the streets committing rapes and other crimes. We have millions in India with no ethics or moral education. The lady MPs who are speaking so eloquently need to address this. Citizens must visit their own neighborhood schools, take pictures and talk to the officials. We need action, not speeches.

Why should the rapists be allowed to live any longer? So that they can spill venom like this for more time? Just hang them now and don't let so called juvenile who escaped with minor penalty roam free ever to commit more crimes. If government is really serious instead of banning documentaries they should request Supreme Court to speed up the verdict.

                            There was a campaign started in UK against domestic violence among Indian community. In the campaign they showed paintings/pictures of Indian goddess Saraswati, Lakshmi, Durga, Parvati with blue eyes sores, whiplash signs of violence of face, arms, and hairs. That will make some sense. But in India we can't do it. Again the same people who indulge in violence against women will come forwards and will indulge in further hooligans that our religious sentiments are hurt. Sentiments hurt more than hurt women.

                            The advocates who hold regressive views should be pulled up by the Bar Council. The advocate who said he would pour petrol and burn his daughter should be booked under IPC for intent to commit murder and the Bar Council should cancel his license to practice. Unless serious action is taken against those who hold regressive views, nothing will change. Make an example of the two advocates who are shown in the documentary.

                            Sensitivity is compassion - sharing of our common humanity - not to inflict pain with word and deed.  Hold a girl child close to your heart and feel the love of God.  Girls are a blessing and we in India disrespect the unique gift of life.  What the world be without girls.  Our political, law and order system is dead.  The pain of parents bring a tear at our helplessness not to share in their grief.  Please do not insult a dead child and dead living parents with such trivial behavior.  This is an opportunity for India to share their pain.  India to see how the parents have been firstly by sorrow inflicted on them and then the delay in justice.  Why we want to ban the screening.

                            The author has put up a very stirring article. I find myself horrified by the statements made on women by the politicians. I fully agree with the author that the film should be compulsory viewing instead of being banned.<br/><br/>
BUT....<br/><br/>
All men think like the brute who was interviewed? Really? Such unfair stereotyping. There are all kinds of men, just like there are all kinds of women. There are probably more than half a billion men in our nation. Labelling all of us evil in righteous rage isn't the way, Ms.Shobhaa De.<br/><br/>
Quite a good percentage of us were raised to respect women. We likely feel otherwise thanks to the  highlighting of the negative happenings by the media. Let us classify with a clear mind here: there are GOOD people, and BAD people of India. Men are not all inherently bad, and women are not all inherently good. <br/><br/>
People are people, and we are all capable of great brutality and kindness.<br/><br/>
So let us condemn the abhorrent statements made concerning the subject of violence against women; let us take a firm stand against people who are so callous as to make statements towards indian culture without even knowing what it is.<br/><br/>
But at the same time, let us keep a sense of proportion and perspective. We must be clinical and cold in excising the bad parts of our society...surgical even. Not like the fire that destroys needlessly in its wake to burn the wicked.
