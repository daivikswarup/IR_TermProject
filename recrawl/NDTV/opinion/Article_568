Headline::::From Didi to Amma, Modi's Big Outreach



DateTime::::2015-05-15T23:32:00+05:30




                                A day after he shared the stage with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee displaying an on-again-off-again camaraderie with the satrap, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up Tamil Nadu heavyweight Jayalalithaa to congratulate her on her acquittal in the disproportionate assets case. The Prime Minister's election campaign focussed on anti-corruption, so the support for Jayalalithaa, who has been forced to quit as Chief Minister twice over allegations of graft, may seem at odds with that stand.
But even Subramanian Swamy, who had filed the petition against Jayalalithaa in court, appeared unusually mellow, stating, "Such decisions by court arise and many political figures have benefited from it in the past."
So what's really brewing?
Both Jayalalithaa and Mamata Banerjee are formidable regional powerhouses whose support could help the government push through key legislation in Parliament, which will be key to improving Modi's less-than-average performance as Prime Minister in the last one year. It must be remembered that not very long ago, BJP chief Amit Shah had aggressively declared that he would drown Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress in the Gangasagar.
Pressure was built on the Trinamool citing the Ponzi Saradha scam and the Burdhwan blasts which provoked Ms Banerjee to accuse the Modi government of using the CBI and National Investigation Agency for political games; in fact, just before the Lok Sabha elections, Didi had promised to send Modi behind bars after he appeared to question the purchase of her paintings by a rich industrialist. So after the recent friction, it was surprising that Modi did not just share the dais with Mamata Banerjee in Bengal, but also held two meetings with her alone, where she allegedly lobbied for a massive debt waiver for her state.
That Mamata Banerjee has 34 seats in the Lok Sabha, is being seen as one of the reasons the PM decided to break the ice after a parliamentary session that saw crucial reforms being stonewalled by the opposition.
But this story is not as much about Mamata Banerjee as it is about Jayalalithaa, revered by her followers as "Amma". With her recent acquittal, Jayalalithaa has not just scored over her political rival in the state, the DMK, but also her rivals at the national level including BJP leader Subramanian Swamy. With Amma's AIADMK forming the third largest party in Parliament, it is reliably believed that Modi has asked for Swamy to be sidelined and for the party to distance itself from any political statement made by the maverick leader.
Jayalalithaa meanwhile has been able to prove that the perception of her as arguably the most formidable woman politician in the country unafraid of vengeance towards her opponents (remember how DMK chief Karunanidhi was arrested from his home late at night in 2001?) but never her "children", the Tamil Nadu voters.
On the 22nd of this month, Jayalalithaa has called a meeting of her party ostensibly to review plans for her comeback as Chief Minister. Much will depend on whether the Congress government in Karnataka, where she was tried in the disproportionate assets case, will appeal in the Supreme Court against her acquittal. The Congress will have to weigh not just the legal but political repercussions of its decision. Jayalalithaa seems to be confident that by the 22nd, there will be some indication of the same. If the Karnataka government decides against an appeal, it will be easier for the BJP to grab support from her 11 MPs in the Rajya Sabha, where the government is in a minority, and needs opposition support, especially for the Land Acquisition Bill which is turning out to be a huge prestige battle for Narendra Modi.
Another significant aspect to be discussed at Jayalalithaa's meeting next week with her party is whether the AIADMK will ask for early elections in Tamil Nadu (not due till next year) in an attempt to maximize the public sentiment around her acquittal.
AIADMK sources say the party agenda will focus on launching a statewide campaign alleging a smear campaign against Amma by the DMK, which followed up on the case that was filed by Subramanian Swamy.
The BJP which has been on an electoral decline since the Lok Sabha elections - it fared disastrously performance in Delhi and was routed in the recent West Bengal municipal elections - does not, according to sources, have very high hopes from Bihar, which votes in a few months. Many in the BJP suggest that the remerger of the Janta Parivaar which includes Nitish Kumar and Lalu could keep the BJP from the victory it seeks. Â 
In the event of a defeat, an unofficial ally like Jayalalithaa could make a world of a difference for the purposes of parliamentary support.
In a column I wrote for ndtv.com last year when Jayalalithaa was convicted and sentenced to prison, I had opined that the verdict was a mere career slump and it would be unwise to write a political obituary of the iconic, authoritarian leader. Make no mistake. Jayalalithaa's back.

                            The author's sweeping generalised comment without any data to back it " Modi's less-than-average performance as Prime Minister" indicates a clear bias in the author's mindset and hence don't think this article is worthy as an objective commentary on this issue.

                            Totally biased column, "a less than average performance by the Modi govt" but more than 60 % of Indians would not agree as multiple surveys show and the reality on the ground. The situation in Bihar points to every likelihood of the BJP forming a govt with the Janata parivaar still bickering over spoils even before they are made available. As far as Mamata Banerjee/Amit Shah's utterances this is par for course in a democracy, no one take them seriously, and as far as the parties cosying up this real-politics which any political analysts anywhere in the world will vouch for. Sad that columnists who are given space get away with half truths and innuendos.

                            If you are writing based on facts, you should have written 'electoral decline since Delhi elections'.. but since you are not writing based on facts and writing based on your wishes, we see things like 'electoral decline since loksabha elections'.. how biased is this writing.. what is the whole point of your article? PM speaks with a CM and a 'to be CM'. You interpret thousands of things from this.. lazy journalism..

                            Politics makes strange bedfellows. Both Mamata and Jayalalithaa are senior politicians, as is Modi. Each of them makes political calculations based on their respective interests. Ayyub has an axe to grind with Modi as her columns show. She is entitled to her opinion regarding Modi's performance in the past one year. In that case what about Rahul Baba, clearly Ayyub's pet, over the past 10 years? Come on, tell it like it is. Cheerleaders like Ayyub will not propel Rahul Baba into the PM's seat. Only the people of India can. And they spoke very clearly last year. And will continue to speak every five years. Modi's performance may not be perfect. But much better than the Congress over the past decade. Ayyub should realise that there is no use in flogging a dead horse. It will not rise up to speed past the winner's post. That is all over and done with. God bless.

                            In T N state, Bjp spokesperson participating in debates do not know anything to counter. In one tamil T V channel, a communist columnist told that modi promised to bring investments for High speed bullet trains and high speed trains for four sectors promised in the first budget, no progress took place for which Bjp Spokesperson was not able to counter with clear answer. Later i browsed the website of HIGH SPEED RAIL CORPORATION LTD meant for this projects, i found progress has been taking place from july 14 onwards steadily with MOUs signed with china and japan and feasibility report tenders and discussion in high level meetings with photos. So i presume modi is on the job but BJP for obvious reasons not interested to reveal since always communists and congress will oppose any development. i am of the view modi is the best P M ever india had.we need to give modi 10 years time as he is not magician to bring limelight in a span of one year.

                            Rather than saying the Land bill as prestige matter for Modi, can you please dare to mention what flaws it has or what advantages it has. Please don't misguide people by such invalid opinions. He wants to bring that as he strongly believes it helps people of India. <br/>
Yes off course when you lead such a big country to get bills passed he needs help of others and there is no wrong in reaching out to them. But reaching out to them doesn't mean he is encouraging corruption. In that case you guys bringing lot of coverage on false statements made by ignorant Rahul Gandhi should be called what?

                            Since we are all over here stating solid reasons for the greatness of Modi and bashing Rana let me give you my solid reasons for the opposite view. Modi is still like an emperor without any clothes. All bluster No boom. Below average is giving him too much credit. Another year like the past one and he will be in full panic mode. As for Rana, why are people commenting and reading her articles when they think so lowly of her? Don't you have better things to do? Obviously not and trolling probably makes them more money than wearing chaddis and attending morchas. And most of you seriously need need to learn basic English before commenting in an English news site. YOU MAKE NO SENSE.Peace!

                            Knowwingly or Unknowingly she explained the shrewdness of Modi. If Modi is trying to get more friends for smooth passage of bills that he believes as good it is still a better approach. Today most of the bills passed by the Govt are stopped in RS becasue BJP is minority there. Honestly it is number game in India with no proper discussion on Pros and Cons of the bill. In such case, Modi has to get his strength in RS. Probably he is doing that right.<br/><br/>
I remember how PV Narasimharao got his proposals passed with his Govt running as a minority most of the time. Still, that was the time when India took many important steps that laid the foundation for growth and stability. He could not have done it if he thought everything within the Party lines

                            While I agree that Manmohan singh's performance was a fail, at least visibly, Modi is no better. Well, comparatively he seems better than Dr. sing. But definitely not an above average. The writer is absolutely right in this regard.
