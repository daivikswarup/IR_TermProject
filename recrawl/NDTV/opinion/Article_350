Headline::::Modi's Delhi Rally Has AAP Very Relieved 



DateTime::::2015-01-11T15:38:00+05:30



(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)I am tempted to call the Modi rally in Delhi a flop show but I will not. I will leave it to the wisdom of the people of Delhi and political pundits to decide. I am also tempted to say that AAP is winning in the Delhi assembly elections with a big margin, but let us leave it to the announcement of the final results by constitutional authorities. What I will certainly say is that Modi in Delhi has met his match in Arvind Kejriwal. The die is cast and the battle will be a historic one for everyone to watch and remember for posterity.They are two individuals with contrasting personalities but both have one thing in common. Both have single-minded pursuit of their goal as their basic trait and are driven by passion unfamiliar to most people. Both of them have a modest middle-class background but the comparison ends there. Modi is more pompous and believes in hyperbole and showing off. His rallies during the 2014 parliamentary elections and thereafter are classic example of money power and power politics. His rallies are always an attempt to showcase him as the most popular and most powerful leader this country has ever had. There is no denying the fact that Modi attracts huge crowds where ever he went for campaigning. Everything in his rallies is well-choreographed like a symphony, micro-managed to the last detail.How will the stage be erected, what background will be chosen, how will TV cameras capture pictures (at Modi rallies, the video feed is not independently captured by the TV channels but provided by the BJP team as a common resource), what will Modi wear and what issues he will raise - all this is worked out carefully. He loves to send his own team in advance to supervise every detail of the rally. His social media team works independently and creates an atmosphere of 'winning'. I am also told by members of his core team that there is a separate team of volunteers whose shouts of 'MODI' 'MODI' reverberate; in terms of TV metaphors, it creates a euphoria which is normally reserved for rock stars.All these attributes were for some reasons were missing at the Ram Lila ground this weekend in Delhi. There was supposedly a crowd of 1 lakh but there were barely 25,000 people at the ground. The Modi connect with the crowd was missing. The BJP's social media campaign was missing its bite. And above all, Modi's attack on Kejriwal was negative. He failed to put forth a positive agenda, a vision for Delhi. Calling Kejriwal an anarchist and a Naxal is not enough. Even Gandhiji, Shaheed Bhagat Singh and JP called themselves anarchist but they all were deeply loved by their countrymen. In his enthusiasm, Modi forgot that he himself had claimed to be a chaiwala who aspired to become a prime minister and finally managed to reach South Block, so how does he now say that people should only do what they are suited for? In that context, he asked the people of Delhi to send Arvind to the jungle (as a Naxal). He was shrill and it showed his weakness. He was not in his element. He looked dissatisfied with the crowd management and lack of enthusiasm in the crowd.In comparison to Modi, Arvind's rallies have everything but money power. It's not an expression of that. AAP just doesn't have that kind of money. I have accompanied Arvind many times. The stage is ordinary, the background simple; there may be a banner that depicts Arvind and the candidate. There is hardly any distance between him and the crowd and any one can walk in to shake hands with him or get a selfie clicked. I have seen women coming with their children to get photographed with him while he was on the stage. Unlike Modi's rallies, there is no security paraphernalia. There is hardly any attempt by his office to micro-manage the affair. He has no qualms about the venue. He can go for any nukkad sabha. For the last three months, he had been addressing two to three jan sabhas very day. By now he has already covered Delhi twice. Arvind is not a great speaker. He rarely raises his pitch and never delves into hyperbole. His speeches are not about himself. Modi loves to boast and projects himself as the messiah. But Arvind has a tremendous connect with the masses and he rarely unleashes negativity. He always focuses on the issues of the day. In Delhi, he has only been talking about the achievements of his government. How policemen and government officials stopped taking bribes in the capital, how he fulfilled his promise of slashing electricity bills by half and making water available free of cost. Then he compares his achievements with those of the Modi government in the last few months, and finally, he talks about what his government will do for Delhi once it is in power. Modi in contrast does not spare his opponents. He calls them names - he referred to Rahul Gandhi as "shehzada" (prince). This does not mean that Arvind spares opponents. But his criticism is more issue -based. If somebody has indulged in corruption or wrong practices, Arvind will not spare them. Modi is certainly a good speaker. His command over Hindi is commendable. But he rarely uses urdu words. His is mostly a sanskritised Hindi. Arvind does not have any inhibitions about usage of any particular language or word. In a Muslim locality, he can start his address by saying "adaab" and in areas like Tilak Nagar and Hari Nagar he greets people with "Sat Shree Akal." He does not shy away if he asked to don a skull cap or a pagdi. Unlike Modi, Arvind is very careless with his clothes. He is not bothered at all. His Raj Kapoor style attire has become a different kind of style statement. Old fashioned -trousers and shirt is his trademark. I have never asked him about his look, but may be it helps him to connect with the Aam Aadmi.Let us not forget both of them had raised hopes. The 2014 elections were a verdict for change. Modi could position himself as an agent of change nationally and as someone with a vision for the future, determined to make India a great nation. People believed him. The BJP got a majority on its own but Delhi has another agent of change. His name is Arvind Kejriwal. AAP is the party. Delhi has seen and experienced Modi rule by proxy in the last seven months. It is time to experience the real thing now. Ram Lila Ground has sent a clear signal. People are not happy with the proxy rule. They waited for the electricity bills to be cut by 30% as promised by the BJP in the previous elections, but nothing of the kind happened. They have hope that Arvind can do it as he did during his 49-day term.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            free water and half-priced electricity is not what we need. we need a government which helps in creating jobs so that people can pay their water and electricity bills and raise their standard of living. i have not seen any thing on AAPs agenda to spur development. AAP will do more harm to Delhi than communist did to west Bengal. AAP's ideaology (they don't have much of it) just does not sit well with Delhi's free spirit and business oriented culture. Majority of people in Delhi want to work hard and succeed and don't want to live on government's free water &amp; electricity

                            Ashutosh be realistic and cannot really compare Arvind with Modi. Pls do not under estimate our intelligence. Pls also write a para on Arvind's credentials, his experience and background in governance and politics. He lost at Varanasi and in the country.  By such articles you are in fact hampering your chances and antogising people.

                            I think in this article, there was no need to focus on points like use of Sanskrit based hindi or urdu, use of religious words. You are again creating perception of a party playing vote bank politics. Use of religion, caste for getting votes is the worst politics we have in our country. If you really want to change stop this thing first. One more point is you can not say everyone is bad, first congress now BJP. If everyone was bad how are we growing today at the rate of 5%. So please offer what you can do new, instead of blaming others.

                            Kejriwal quit as CM of Delhi thinking he can become PM &amp; that is the reason he decided to take on Modi in Varanasi. He grandly announced in Varanasi that he is here to stay and will stay back and serve the people of Varanasi even if he loses. How many times after May 16 has he gone to Varanasi? Stop fooling people. I can't speak about Delhiites &amp; they may well vote for AAP with a majority and that's their choice and luck but surely AAP doesn't deserve another chance so soon.<br/><br/>
A lot of times questions are asked about results of 7 months of Modi as PM. If we want to change something about ourselves , it takes more then 7 months. This is the country we are talking about. You want to know the difference between Modi and AAP. AAP had the chance but made a daily tamasha of governance for 49 days and decided to run off. Modi has dug in knowing he has won a 5 year term and is trying to get things done. he knows the promises he has made and is working hard to achieve them. That is the difference. One may question where is black money in 100 days? In elections, there are some statements made for effect, some statements are hyped. Only a fool would believe that the country's black money will be brought back in 100 days but the same countrymen can see that the government has initiated the process and are working hard to bring back black money. It may take 6 months, 3 years, 5 years or maybe 10 but the government is doggedly pursuing the issue. It's all about niyat which AAP failed to show in their 49 days. You cannot run a government from tv studios. People may have forgotten the spectacle of the CM sleeping on a footpath, signing work files over there and grandly announcing he cares shit for the independence day parade coming up until his ego is not satisfied. The tamasha of 49 days is very much fresh in our minds. Only hope it's fresh in the minds of the people of Delhi.<br/><br/>
As for cheap/free electricity &amp; water. Those who vote for these short term subsidies and freebies should not cry when government hikes excise duty on petrol and diesel instead of giving us price reduction. People should realise that Kejriwal is not giving free power and water out of his pocket. he is using our tax money to give us free stuff. Something has to give. Someone somewhere has to pay because there are no freebies in life. Guess who ultimately pays? So like Mr.Modi said in his speech yesterday, he doesn't plan or promise to give us free power but he definitely promises to give us 24X7 power. I am wiling to pay for consistant power and help my country to move forward. Condition is if I see my leader's having the vision that people will happily pay for services if they are reliable.

We know how Asuthosh ran his news team when he was the editorial head of that channel.  Usual contributor to this blog ST is missing since fir, and this gentle man will also disappear after Delhi election.  BTW how is that most of the time MSI,ASU,RA and ST find place often in this blog.

                            Hi Mr. Ashutosh U have forgotten the basic courtesy to respect PM of the country by calling him singularly as MODI . As I have been told that you are a ex media guy so u have to be arrogant so please carry on along with arrogance of Mr. Kejriwal , Mr. Bharti , Mr. Shishodia who even showed gate to Respectable Shri Annaji . But not to worry Delhi will throw you &amp; AAP out of it's borders in few weeks time.

That will be a good choice for Indians to compare and decide if both models solves common man's problems.

While we all are very happy to see Modi ji speak hindi that we all look forward to hear him everytime, I must say your English has also improved. Unless this write up has been done  by one of you media  team member. You see we all know your capabilities with the Queen's language. Yeh to rahi bhasha ki baat, abb aate hai numbers pe. 25 thousand had  three zeroes and not four. Numerically you have actually written twenty five lakhs. This shows the haste in which you want to bring down the popularity on our PM. So basically AAP bhasha aur numbers dono me hi..gul batti hai.

                            Dear Mr. Ashutosh, i can understand that since you are in the media you have expertise to draw a "HIT RALLY" into a "FLOP SHOW" :) You were so unethical yourself when you were an "Anchor" a sleeping AAP Anchor !! weren't you? Modi has earned it, he deserves it, he has not just left a job and jumped into the political arena by stabbing "Anna" from the behind. Modi has worked hard for over 30 years, he obviously has more influence, his party has more money, his party is national party. So why do you even compare your party to his at your own convenience !! You were cheating the "Media" by being an anchor though you had a hidden agenda. Modi will win Big, Modi speaks loud because he has given outputs unlike your party which only believes in poking or nibbinng others !! your party stoops to all low and then defends it !! Your gimmicks will end on the result day , dnt you worry. <br/>
BTW i am not from the BJP :) i am a free citizen

                            Mr.Ashutosh, don't compare Kejriwal to someone like Modi. Modi's superb campaign brought him 300+ seats, what about the over-hyped campaign of Kejriwal. People thrashed him everywhere and you people could manage a shameless 4 seats only. You people have no right to speak about Modi

                            Please do look at some of my comments on Charlie. On these one, here is my logic.<br/>
life is not possible in extremes ( cold or hot), aag or paani dono proportionate ho to , it results in the best output/life...so it is all about the balance.<br/>
- anybody has problems with Modi's intent - No<br/>
- Do we have problems in Modi's way - Yes/No ( subject to interpretation)<br/>
ex: He is not bringing down the petrol price proportionately as per global downtrend. He is using this opportunity to collect funds which he can use for development activities. Now intent is good, but if he doesn't use the money ( and people like gadkari siphons it off), then we have a problem.<br/>
- is he surrounded by fools ( except some other good cabinet ministers) - Yes<br/>
- Is he supporting Adani - Yes<br/>
- do we question Kejriwal intent to bring a change ? - No<br/>
- Is he having personal ambitions - Yes ( but who cares even if he takes support from others.)<br/>
- Does he have a good team ( not sadhu and sants) - Yes<br/>
don't take me as a aapian, but purely from citizen perspective. best combo PM modi, Delhi CM - Arvind. Now modi will become more earnest in executing his development agenda and kejri will be more earnest to impelement his pro poor/anti corruption agenda. when there is competiton , we citizens will gain. Only bad point is, in some case, kejri will not get enough for support from centre ( which is logical and we need to live with it)..<br/>
so good combination of aag and paani. Upto supporters to think who is aag and who is paani, but from my perspective, this is the best thing can happen to india. Both these leaders will keep the other in check...<br/>
bhakts/aapians - think like this...it is like, if a batsman sees another good batsman taking his place, he will play even better/harder, like wise the competitor batsman will also play better...who gains, india as a country..

Where were all u guys for the past 10 years????? When there were no development happening in the country. Modiji has just completed only 7 months in office and within this short period he has made the entire world look,at us.

Just go and check what has he reaped out of his foreign trips, his vibrant Gujarat is another DRAMA where in 2014 out of 21 lakh crore investment promised only 1% was invested. Same will happen in 2015! People who are ridiculing AK will see the results themselves when he will become the CM, as I m a Delihite and I know what is the sentiment. He will be the CM. 1 PM, 3 Minister, State and National Party leader, 7 MPs came to speak against 1 Man and you say BJP is not scared! Face the reality people. Modi is having sleepless nights. Oh yes, we cannot compare AK with Modi, AK is educated and done something which 98% of you couldn't do.

                            Is Delhi only for slum dwellers or people who have encroached land illegally?<br/>
Or is it for muftkhors (people who want water &amp; electricity for free)?<br/>
What about those middle class people who have paid for their flats through their nose and pay Income Tax year after year.<br/>
Do they deserve such poor living conditions (which will become much worse if AAP will come to Power)?<br/>
If water, electricity etc. will be free, who will pay for it?<br/>
I am sure all the finds meant for infrastructure will be siphoned to pay for AAP's misadventure.

                            Bjp seems totally vision less in case of Delhi! <br/>
In other states bjp won due to the anticumbancy present,,but Delhi is a totally different case ,here ppl already have a best option Arvind and AAP,so bjp should not even think about Delhi,,DELHIITES have already choosen kejriwal which  is clearly visible from the overwhelming support of ppl in his rallies!<br/>
So bjp should think of reviving MCD first,,KejriwL will take best care of Delhi,,:D<br/>
We don't want bjp here!<br/>
Good luck AAP! Delhi needs you!

                            I don't see BJP has done much in past few months except big marketing to invite foreign companies to invest in India. We need AAP to come up as big alternative to congress(&amp; free from Nehru family)

                            If AAP is going give out free electricity, water and subsidize everything, Soon Delhi Govt will go Bankrupt. Invest in infrastructure and give the tax payers value for the amount of taxes they pay.
