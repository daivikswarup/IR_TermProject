Headline::::When the BJP Tries to Manufacture Heroes



DateTime::::2015-12-17T21:22:00+05:30




                                It has been a practice in India that important buildings and roads are named after historical figures as a mark of respect to their memory and their contribution to India. There have been controversies in the past on the naming of airports, universities, sports complexes and so on with a recurrent widespread opposition to the practice of the then ruling dispensation led by the Congress party to name public institutions in the names of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family - as though it was only they who were the heroes of India's freedom struggle and contributions to independent India's development. Under the BJP-RSS combine, that objectionable practice is sought to be replaced by renaming such public places in the name of the manufactured "heroes" of the Sangh Parivar.
 
The latest example is the shameful controversy on the naming of the new airport terminal in Chandigarh in which a new low has been established because it involves India's most beloved national hero, Bhagat Singh. His name is being dragged into petty politics by those who have never contributed a drop of sweat, leave alone blood, for the freedom of the country.
 
The controversy has been created by the ruling regimes at the Centre and in two states in which BJP is in government, namely, Haryana and Punjab. The facts are as follows:
 
In 2009, the Punjab Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution to name the proposed airport in Chandigarh after Bhagat Singh. This was conveyed to the Centre. A year later, the Haryana government also unanimously adopted a resolution endorsing the proposal of the Punjab government for naming the airport after Bhagat Singh.
The airport is a joint venture with the Punjab and Haryana governments holding 24.5 per cent of equity each, and the Airports Authority of India, a government undertaking under the Civil Aviation Ministry, holding the remaining 51 per cent. The Prime Minister inaugurated the new terminal in September of this year. However, there was no name to the airport.
A week ago, the reason for this unprecedented situation was revealed in the official written response by Minister of State for Civil Aviation Mahesh Sharma to a question raised in the Lok Sabha by Congress MP Ravneet Bittu. The reply stated that "...In a subsequent letter, the Chief Minister of Haryana has requested naming the international terminal as Dr. Mangal Sein International Airport Chandigarh. The proposal was examined in consultation with the ministries concerned and the Governments of Haryana and Punjab. However due to non-consensus between Haryana and Punjab, the airport terminal could not be renamed."
 
This is a totally deceptive explanation. The so-called non-consensus is between two minority shareholders. The majority shareholder is the Airports Authority of India which is under the Central Government. What does this organization have to say about this unseemly controversy? When Mahesh Sharma replies that all concerned ministries have been "consulted", what was his own ministry's position in the course of these consultations? Why is he silent on this issue, misleading Parliament? Clearly, Punjab is for renaming the terminal after Bhagat Singh as per their earlier resolution; if the Civil Aviation Ministry also agrees, then the majority opinion would be against the Haryana Chief Minister's objectionable intervention. But the central government under Modi itself is unwilling to displease the RSS-backed Chief Minister. There lies the problem.
Who is Mangal Sein? A long-time RSS ideologue who became Deputy Chief Minister of Haryana for a short stint between 1977-1979; he was also the BJP state President. If Khattar wanted to name his party bhavan after Sein, that would have been his right. But who is this Chief Minister who can, behind the back of the Haryana Assembly, overturn its earlier resolution about naming the airport after Bhagat Singh? It is only an RSS pracharak who can think of replacing the name of Bhagat Singh with one of their own.
 
This is what is called manufacturing heroes, and this is what the BJP-RSS combine is adept at doing, given the slightest opportunity.
 
In its earlier stint in power under the Vajpayee Government, the then NDA insulted the freedom fighters by naming the airport at Port Blair after VD Savarkar, the author of the Hindutva concept. It was from the cells of the Andaman Jail that Savarkar wrote his now infamous letter of apology to the British Government literally begging for mercy calling himself the "prodigal son" offering " I am ready to serve the Government in any capacity they like" in shameful surrender before the British empire. It is not the early Savarkar that the Sangh celebrates..the Savarkar as a freedom fighter, was a rationalist, an atheist, who considered cow worship as superstitious and irrational, but the Savarkar who during his incarceration of two years turned to a virulent form of communal and divisive thinking which weakened his will to fight the British and ultimately led him to Hindutva, the concept which is at the core of the RSS agenda of Hindu Rashtra. 
 
The plaque reads "Vinayak Damodar Savarkar Indian patriot, philosopher lived here." A "patriot" who surrendered to the imperial power. There were real heroes who spent years locked up in the cellular jail, facing the most terrible torture at the hands of the British, including the youngest of them, teenager Subodh Roy, but none of them were considered fit by the then government to have the Port Blair airport named after them. History had to be manufactured by insulting true patriots.
 
Recently on December 6, the death anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the chief of the RSS, Mohan Bhagwat, made a speech in which he compared the Sangh's founder chief KB Hedgewar with Ambedkar. The former founded an organization -  the RSS -  which worked against the very idea of India for the establishment of a Hindustan only for the Hindus. The latter was one who chose to renounce Hinduism and its caste-based inequalities. That is the most obvious dissimilarity, which in fact stretched to all spheres of their thinking and their practice. Hedgewar is not known outside the  circle of the Sangh Parivar. Bhagwat's comparison is not just an insult to Ambedkar, but another example of how the Sangh Parivar wants to latch on to the heroism of acknowledged national icons, and, through false comparisons, squeeze in a place for themselves.
 
They are welcome to their attempts which will find little resonance. But when they start misusing public money and Government institutions to manufacture heroes and rewrite history by insulting martyrs like Bhagat Singh, there has to be a full stop put to such attempts, if not by the Government, then by public opinion.(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            The basic problem is that all the Sanghi types did not lift a finger for the nation's independence. <br/><br/>
While Nehru and Gandhi and others spent years in jail away from family and friends, these people basically helped the British implement their divide and rule policy. So they are basically on par with Jinnah who helped the British implement the Muslim side of the divide and rule policy. Not surprisingly, neither the Sangh parivar types nor Jinnah spent a day in jail. <br/><br/>
And now their successors are busy trying to rewrite history to make them into the heroes they were not.

                            Insulting Swatntraweer Vinayak Damodar Sawarkar publicly is insulting 12 crore Maharashtrians, Read his biography, his work on caste equality, his escape from  British ship by jumping in the high seas, and swimming to France, and then again get caught there. His Kalapani or life imprisonment in Andaman and Nikobar islands, his contribution to Marathi language by giving more than 1000 words, yes thankfully we have Marathi words for very common English words used in Hindi, and we pride we can talk in Marathi more cleanly without using English words, inventing an appropriate and accurate and concise Marathi word for an equivalent English word and that too 1000 of them needs a Sahitya academy award. But his struggle for independence also mandates a Bharat Ratna. Yes he did not like the Leftees and Atheists  and Nehru Gandhi pariwar, that I agree.  Vande Mataram.

                            While in jail, Savarkar wrote the work describing Hindutva, openly espousing Hindu nationalism. In 1921, under restrictions after signing a plea for clemency, he was released on the condition that he renounce revolutionary activities. Travelling widely, Savarkar became a forceful orator and writer, advocating Hindu political and social unity. Serving as the president of the Hindu Mahasabha, Savarkar endorsed the ideal of India as a Hindu Rashtra and opposed the Quit India struggle in 1942, calling it a "Quit India but keep your army" movement. He became a fierce critic of the Indian National Congress and its acceptance of India's partition. He was one of those accused in the assassination of Indian leader Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and was acquitted in the trial.<br/>
unlike other patriots like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Ashfaqullah, who refused to ask the British Raj for mercy even at the cost of their lives, Savarkar, the father of the BJP's Hindutva ideology, had actually sought clemency while lodged in Andamans' Cellular Jail. <br/>
.<br/>
 Savarkar's letter asking for forgiveness dated November 14, 1913 is reprinted in a book, Penal Settlement In Andamans, published by the Gazetteers Unit of Union ministry of education. <br/>
.<br/>
 Savarkar described himself as a ''prodigal son'' longing to return to the ''parental doors of the government''. While referring to his earlier letter of clemency in 1911, Savarkar wrote, ''...if the government in their manifold beneficence and mercy release me, I for one cannot but be the staunchest advocate of constitutional progress and loyalty to the English government which is the foremost condition of that progress. As long as we are in jails, there cannot be real happiness and joy in hundreds and thousands of homes of His Majesty's subjects in India, for blood is thicker than water; but if we are released, the people will raise a shout of joy and gratitude to the government, who knows how to forgive and correct, more than how to chastise and avenge.'' .<br/>
 Savarkar went on to add, ''Moreover, my conversion to the constitutional line would bring back all those misled young men in India and abroad who were once looking up to me as their guide. I am ready to serve the government in any capacity they like, for as my conversion is conscientious so I hope my future conduct would be. By keeping me in jail, nothing can be got in comparison to what would be otherwise. The Mighty alone can afford to be merciful and, therefore, where else can the prodigal son return but to the parental doors of the government.''

They have dumped all bills, diverted people's attention and misled public that they are in winning side. Dear countrymen, rise and awake. ask these lawmakers not to waste time and no more abuses. They should have to show their worth and honour people's verdict.

                            A very strong argument on why the airport needs to be named after one of India's freedom fight hero Bhagat Singh. I hope more public support rises for this just cause. As for the current establishment and its vain activities, there is no use saying anything. Only people need to give a fitting reply.

                            and who is your / congress hero.... Rahul Gandhi ????? Common Brindaji... have some self respect and show you are educated and literate. The article talks what BJP is doing... where were you when Congress was doing all these things? What happened to your thoughts, your education at that time? <br/><br/>
The school text books are so skewed towards the Gandhi - nehru parivar....ask a school going kid.. what is so great about 2nd October and you will hear it is Mahatma Gandhi's birthday...you will have to prod the kid by asking what else is so great about 2nd October...the kid would be wondering...whats so great...and when you tell the kid something about Lal Bahadur Shastri and the kid will say...aahh..yes<br/><br/>
That's the kind of ignorance the school text books show towards people who do not belong to Gandhi-Nehru parivar. That's what the congress has been teaching for last 68 years. Its time, someone stood up and wiped the slate clean. We just don't want Gandhi-Nehru names reflecting anywhere..does not matter who they get replaced with...but no more gandhi-nehru..we have had enough of them.

                            The CPM is fast becoming a fading party. Naming a street or Airport after some one is a non issue. There are more pressing glaring issues like the Reservations Raj and the direction of deliverance of Justice. Even after 67 years , meritocracy does not prevail. Tainted politicians walk free, and probably will die free. Corruption breaches  3000-5000 crore range and will soon be more dynamic mode. Pot bellied force reigns the Police and Defense cadres at all levels. Education had become and Trust and capitation business. The whole country is filthy beyond belief. There are burning issues.
