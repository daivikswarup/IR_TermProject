Headline::::Child Development: Kerala Tops, Gujarat Flops, Bihar Hops



DateTime::::2015-11-18T18:53:00+05:30




                                Children have been out of focus in recent debates on public policy in India. Even when budget cuts threaten to undermine child nutrition programmes, the mainstream media barely takes notice. The recent release of summary findings of the Rapid Survey On Children 2013-14 (RSOC) is an opportunity to correct this bias and take a fresh look at the state of Indian children.Helpfully, RSOC figures are comparable with similar data from the third National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3) for 2005-6. In earlier work published in Economic and Political Weekly, we used NFHS-3 data to construct a simple child development index analogous to the Human Development Index, but based on child-related indicators. This can be done again, with minor modifications, using NFHS-3 as well as RSOC data. This time, the four component indicators are: proportion of children fully immunised; female literacy in the age group of 10-14 years; proportion of births preceded by an ante-natal checkup; and proportion of children who are not underweight. In the absence of survey data on age-specific female literacy rates, we use the 2001 and 2011 censuses, respectively, for the literacy indicator. The indicators are normalised using the standard HDI method, and given equal weight (See here)The results are presented in Table 1. Note that the absolute value of the index is not strictly comparable across years - what can be compared is the ranking of states in 2005-6 and 2013-14. As it happens, the ranking is quite similar in both years and its basic features are familiar. At the top of the list come Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu - states that might be called "supermodels" if Gujarat were a model, which it is not. Indeed, Gujarat ranked 14th in the list of 20 major states in 2005-6, and slipped to 15th in 2013-14, with a child development index well below the all-India average.Predictably enough, the other lagging states belong to the region formerly known by the unflattering acronym of BIMARU - undivided Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. However, some important contrasts have emerged within this region. Chhattisgarh, for instance, has detached itself from the rest as far as child development is concerned. Indeed, the child development index for Chhattisgarh is above the all-India average, and of course above Gujarat. Uttarakhand is doing even better. Uttar Pradesh, on the other hand, has replaced Bihar at the rock bottom.Bihar is still close to the bottom, but in absolute terms, it has progressed a great deal (from an abysmally low base) between 2005-6 and 2013-14. For instance, the proportion of births preceded by an ante-natal checkup in Bihar shot up from 34 per cent in 2005-6 to 85 per cent in 2013-14 - the largest improvement among all major states by a long margin. Similarly, the proportion of children fully immunised jumped from 33 per cent to 60 per cent. For a state that was thought incapable of running basic health services until very recently, this is a real breakthrough.We explored variants of this index e.g. using stunting instead of low weight as the nutrition indicator, or looking at breastfeeding instead of ante-natal care. While some of these variants lead to a somewhat different ranking, the basic patterns are fairly robust: Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh are at the top, the former BIMARU states (minus Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand) at the bottom, and Gujarat near the all-India average.So what do Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh have in common? One part of the answer is that in each case, rapid progress followed a major expansion of elementary education. The timing differed, but mass schooling was the prime mover without exception. Second, the constructive role of the state also extended, later on, to the provision of a wide range of essential services and facilities - from health care and clean water to social security and basic infrastructure. Third, active social policies enabled disadvantaged groups to have a voice in the democratic process, and that, in turn, led to broad-based support for social development across political parties. Fourth, none of this prevented any of these states from doing well in terms of economic growth - on the contrary. Finally, despite regular warnings that this approach is not "sustainable", Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh keep expanding the reach and quality of public services. Tamil Nadu, for instance, has recently introduced pioneering schemes of maternity entitlements, community kitchens, and even nursing rooms at bus stands.Can other states take a leaf from these successful experiences? Kerala used to be thought of as some sort of anomaly among Indian states, but now Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh are in the same league. And other states, including some that looked like basket cases not so long ago, are catching up too. Here is some food for thought: in terms of the four indicators considered here, Bihar today is more or less on par with Tamil Nadu in the early 1990s (see infographics below). This can be read to mean that Bihar is more than 20 years behind Tamil Nadu in this field. But if the gap between Bihar and Tamil Nadu continues to narrow, as it did in the last 10 years, this also suggests that Bihar may take less than 20 years to look like Tamil Nadu today as far as child development is concerned. That is certainly a cheerful thought. And if Bihar can catch up, why not every state?(Reetika Khera is a development economist and teaches at IIT-Delhi)(Jean Dreze is a development economist and visiting professor at the Department of Economics at Ranchi University)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            What is so surprising about this data? It is in-keeping with what everyone knows. If you ignore the so-called 'Gujarat Model' which is creation of some very fertile PR agencies and political minds ... these are things that come as no surprise. Buildings malls and flyovers is not development. Development has many aspects to it: Economic, Social, Cultural, Child &amp; Gender aspects, Education etc.  In almost all aspects like Education, gender, children ... Gujarat is horrible. Tell me one thing simple: How many educated youngsters want to move to Gujarat? We would rather move to Bangalore or Mumbai or NCR but Ahmedabad or Surat ... no way!! That says it all. If a place is really well developed in all angles, educated youngsters would like to migrate there.

                            OK....you have very cleverly not made it clear who ran this survey. If Jean Derez led the survey then there is no question that Gujarat would be made to look worse that in actually is and commie states will be made to look better than they actually are. Surveys in India are as reliable as the people who are running them and are often used to reinforce the opinion of the survey taker.

                            Thanks to massive remittances from Gulf Countries, the money received in Kerala households get channelized into different sectors like Health Care, Education Sectors, Child Development etc. All these contributed to high Human Development Index(HDI) in Kerala, not due to any State Government efforts. It is MONEY FLOW from Gulf Countries, not COMMUNISM that contributed to Kerala's prosperity and Human Development.

Explain that first in this space and then indulge in Bihar-Gujarat-Kerala jingoistics.

                            This report is an absolute white lie and there is something fishy about this report. I am from Tamil Nadu and I know Kerala first hand.  I live in Gujarat in Surat and I also move around the villages around Surat quite a bit and have visited most parts of Gujarat.The TRUTH is Gujarat is far ahead of these two states I mention in every aspect. Believe me, every one including Women and Children are safe here which you will not feel in the other two states with goons, thieves and rapists all around. In all the Cities of Gujarat you can see this. You have to live in all the places to know the difference. That is why most of the Malayalis come to work here in Gujarat and make a living. Gujarat is a paradise. Some people say Mumbai is a good city come and live in Surat or any other city of Gujarat, you will know what you have missed. This report is biased and has Mr. Dreze in it so it says a lot about the validity of it. Ask anyone who lives in Gujarat. They will tell you the truth not some congress or left sympathizer from elsewhere who has some shoddy data deliberately manipulated to his/her convenience.

                            Generally, Southern States have always shown greater prosperity and careful attention to social indicies. Hence Kerala and Tamilnadu doing well is expected. But, Gujarat model is a matter for huge concern because a 'trickle down' economic model delivers very little in terms of social indicies

                            I looked at the stats mentioned. One thing that I could not understand is Gujarat's stats improved on all four variables. Proportion of fully immunized children from 45% to 56%. Female literacy rate from 82 to 93%. Proportion of birth check up from 87 to 88%. Proportion of children that are not underweight from 85 to 88%. Where as the overall child development index is negative from .561 to .484. I could not understand how the overall index is down when all factors improved.

                            Instead of politicking on the findings it is important for the poor performing states to send delegations particularly to Kerala and Bihar to understand how they are able to make this impact. Even though Bihar continues to be among the bottom 4 states they have recorded the highest positive growth of 76%, while Kerala has continued to hold its leadership position. It is sad that the 3 states with the highest negative growth are UP (-131%),MP and Gujarat (-16%).

                            Developmental index is based on incremental percentage increase. These idiots will twist the fact to their liking and misinform.<br/>
So if an attribute is at low coverage and even if there is slight increase it will show larger percentage increase and index. Similarity is Bihar development index.<br/>
Gujrat etc are already at higher index so there is little or sometimes no percentage index.<br/>
The observation are  correct but presented in wrong way to audience for interpretation.
