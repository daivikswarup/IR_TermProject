Headline::::How AAP Won a Historic Result in Delhi



DateTime::::2015-02-10T13:17:00+05:30



(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)
	Historic. Yes, history has taken a decisive turn. The Delhi elections are finally over and the results are out. Many myths have been busted. The leader often described as most popular and most powerful has been humbled. The aura of invincibility is broken. The impossible has been achieved. The Aam Aadmi Party has won. The BJP has lost.
	If we had predicted something like this a few months ago, people would have laughed at us and called us a bunch of loonies. I still remember how just some weeks after the parliamentary elections, people in Arvind Kejriwal's constituency shut doors on his face. He once told me how a local guard, seeing him walk by, had commented sarcastically about wanting to be the PM. His reference was to Arvind going to Varanasi to contest against Modi, then the darling of the masses.
	The last Parliamentary elections were the worst thing that could have happened to any party or leader other than the BJP! AAP had lost all the seven seats in its pocket burrough of Delhi. It had contested more than 400 seats and its candidates had lost their deposits in almost 90% of the seats. The Party was ridiculed as zamaanat zapt party (the party which has lost its deposits).
	Arvind Kejriwal was ridiculed no end. He was badly bruised. Experts had written his obituary. AAP as a party was declared dead despite improving its vote share in Delhi by 4% and winning four seats in Punjab.
	We all were down. We knew elections in Delhi were due and could be announced any moment. We had to pull ourselves together and above all, we all had to believe that though we had lost the battle, the war was still on. For the first time, I saw Arvind shaky and vulnerable. He was not the same person. He seemed tentative.  But like a General, he slowly gathered himself and decided to face the miseries of life with courage and made plans on 'how it could be done'. For us, it was a do-or-die situation. Victory was the only alternative. A plan was chalked out. We identified our negatives and listed three major ones:
	1. We realised that the people of Delhi were very upset. They felt cheated. They had wanted Arvind to continue as the Chief Minister. He should not have resigned.  So Arvind openly admitted that he had committed a mistake. He admitted he should have continued despite his failure to make the Jan Lokpal a law.  He was still considered honest. His integrity was unmatched. He tried assuring people that he would not resign again. He asked for Forgiveness.
	2. As a party, AAP has been accused of specializing in 'Dharna'. Our record as a party of governance was very poor in the eyes of the intellectual class. We looked for a framework. Delhi Dialogues was one such idea. It broke the myth that manifesto-making is a one-day phenomenon. AAP decided to bring back the equilibrium. AAP had to prove it could be a party of governance. The party unleashed a policy framework; it took the discussion about Delhi development to the people, the 'common man.' It was decided to make the campaign 'positive', to keep the development of Delhi as the main focus.
	3. During the last assembly elections, our volunteer base was very strong but it did not have a structured shape. It was decided to augment the energy of the volunteers and strengthen the organisation to the booth level. More than ten frontal organisations were also created. By the time elections were declared, AAP was already a well-oiled engine.  And Arvind had already toured every constituency twice.
	Once the list of negatives was made, the effort was to overcome these with an open mind. It was tough but not impossible. Arvind was of the opinion that AAP, as a matter of strategy would not participate in any election, be it assembly or municipal outside Delhi. Some of the leaders did not like the idea. Arvind was adamant. He did not want any adverse impact on Delhi elections.  Energy was to be consolidated.
	By mid-December, we had regained our confidence. We knew it would be a tough contest but we would pull through. Modi was the only hitch. We waited for Modi to address his rally at Ram Lila Ground. The rally flopped. We were ecstatic. The BJP's trump card had failed. The BJP became desperate and started looking for someone who could be as credible as Arvind. It could not find one in its party. It had to borrow from outside. Kiran Bedi was declared  the Chief Ministerial candidate. We were a little apprehensive. But we knew that if she started talking to cameras, she would be a great asset for AAP. She delivered. Our script was complete. Bedi could not control herself.
	The BJP committed another mistake. In trying times, it resorted to negatives and abuses. We were careful and decided to stick to our development plank. We talked about eradication of corruption, providing electricity at half the current price and water free of cost. Free Wi- Fi was another hit. The poor and marginalised were strongly with us. Minorities joined us as the Congress was nowhere in the contest. The middle class which was disenchanted with us due to our shrillness when we were in government, got disillusioned with the BJP's negative campaign. The BJP's personalized attack on Arvind put them off. Big promises but zero delivery broke the myth that Modi was in any way different from Manmohan Singh. We wanted these elections to be a referendum on Arvind and in the end we succeeded in doing so.
	These elections will go down in history as the turning point- a game-changer. They proved the point that clean politics and affordable politics is possible. AAP did not have the money to match the might and resources of the BJP, but it had the moral edge over its opponent. People of India are fed up with traditional politics of money power, muscle power and manipulation. They are looking for an alternative.
	AAP's massive victory will start a new alignment of forces; a new dawn has appeared. It will make politics cool. The common man can now afford to enter politics and succeed. It will no longer be a game of only scoundrels. A small step by AAP, but a big leap in politics.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

Well said Mr.Ashutosh. Modi and BJP forgot that they were elected to give good governance and for development. The heady of mix of power and electoral victories in couple of states intoxicated Modi and BJP leaders and they started going astray from the path to be trodden. Modi and BJP must realise that Hindutva is not going to feed the common man and only development leading to job creation will satisfy the common man who voted for them in the LOKSABHA polls. Modi must publicly denounce the atrocities perpetrated by the so called fringe elements of the Sangh Parivar and start taking India in the right path.

                            Congrats AAP. Winning is understandable but winning with such magnitude does create history. This win is actually a win against power and might. It's very important to send right signals to national parties not to get overboard by their history. Hope AAP fulfills their promises unlike BJP, else people won't take too long dump those who take them for granted.

                            Arvind is a real hero. I'm a big fan of him and now you have become a role model for a common man. "Never underestimate the power of a common man". One thing is clear that if you have good intentions,determination and self belief, God will always help you.

Sad that Delhi which is considered one of the world's emerging great cities will fall to the level of Kolkata in 5 years. Delhi will be a communist like city under AAP..Sadly, Kejriwal doesn't have vision....Delhites fell for his cheap tactics.....

                            Some important points why the BIG, the MIGHTY lost -<br/><br/>
1. Delay tactics in holing the election, running the Govt keeping Governor as the face of it. It's only when the SC scolded them, they had to go for it.<br/>
2. Extreme negativism. No positives or constructive campaign.<br/>
3. Huge banner, hoardings, posters with ONE and ONLY one person as the face of the entire party. people are slowly getting tired of it, if not completely.<br/>
5. Last eight months, since the time the central Govt came to power, every alternate day we get to see some sort of campaign. Be it in USA, Australia, Japan or elsewhere. All are very extravagant, mighty and stage managed. Nothing has really been done on the ground. People are cautious this time. Thought let's put some checks and balances on it.<br/>
6. In spite of the might shown everywhere, lack of seriousness observed to control the fringe elements, who are spitting venom day in and day out. No efforts are observed to put a check on them.<br/>
7. Delay in announcing the CM candidate and the right candidate. They should not have broken the winning combination. Remember last time (2013) also they won with a touch short of majority. <br/><br/>
As a humble citizen, who is watching this election from far away, my suggestion is, everyone should focus on their WORK. Enough display of power and might, now this is the high time to do some serious work that can really benefit India and take us to the next level. Otherwise only the oratory skills and vision statements can not guarantee the next term.

                            Heartiest congratulations to Ashutosh, Kejriwal and team. In fact its a well deserved result. Still, I truly feel the real winner is the people of Delhi who overcame the communal and polarization tactics of other parties and voted for development and well being of common man. India is above any religion, caste, gender or state. The persistent politics of hatred in the form of ghar wapsi, love Jihad, population expansion, antichurch propaganda and omitting secular word from constitution will pay no dividends. Lets not forget that whenever we demonstrated full religious unity we succeded. We are Indian, we love India and we will die for India. I am cent percent confidant that AAP is truly Indian and secular in character. JAI HIND.

                            Well written and so true! <br/><br/>
This is a turning point in the history of Indian politics and perhaps, in the entire world. I do not know of any other political party that lists its donors in a transparent manner. Nor do I know of any other party that goes to every street in a city and meets with its citizens to ask how to spend the money allotted to their constituency. I do not know of any leader who refuses security and travels in a beat up car.<br/><br/>
Arvind and AAP: you are truly inspirational. I know that Arvind gets his strength from his regular practice of Vipassana meditation. <br/><br/>
Now, use this strength to: 1. Pass the Lok Pal bill;<br/>
2. Audit the electricity firms;<br/>
3. Give the water to the needy;<br/>
4. Reach out to all segments of society.<br/><br/>
Nobody is expecting miracles overnight. But, keep working with your head down: do not react to the taunts, barbs and criticism that will come your way. The results will follow.<br/><br/>
Take a bow! Enjoy your moment. Rewrite history. Gandhiji will approve.

                            Beware of AAP. They are nothing but Congress V2.0.<br/>
I would never vote people who are being praised so much by Pakistan.<br/>
I really doubt their ability. I have seen BJP performance in Gujarat they have proven track record but this guys does not look serious at all.<br/>
Let us see what they do.<br/>
I would not get that excited yet.

This is no doubt a fitting reply to our popular PM Modi's long silence to the atrocities meted out to the minorities in the nation. How can he shut his mouth and close his eyes and ears on such hate speeches by his allies in the party. Act Modiji Act, before it's too late!

                            For a change Ashutosh has come up with a rational and reasonably thought out article. I am not an AAP fan, but what I admire about Arvind Kejriwal is that he has the guts and gumption to admit to his mistakes, rectify them, learn from them and move forward. But what AK should be careful about is that his party members do not get arrogant. During campaign the AAP was telling people that in spite of being in power for about 9 months, BJP has not been able to fulfill all its promises. It will be the same story with AAP. Remember that BJP has to fight through the Rajya Sabha to get any bill or legislation passed whereas AAP does not have that cushion. They have a brute majority and any delay in even the most minor matter will probably be held against them.

                            Congratulations on your win. Now walk the talk. There's a lot of comparison to Modi and rightly so. But, can Kejriwal do what Modi did for Gujarat? It's one thing to promise free water, electricity etc but it's another thing to make it happen. Good luck. The party is over time to get down to work.

                            it is always easy to analyse after the event. To say that these steps worked is frankly foolish. BJP lost because of arrogance - full stop. It is not because AAP is a better political party. We all root for the underdog and that's what gave AAP a victory. Amit Shah needs to rethink, so does Modi but AAP needs to be supremely careful. Mistakes are easily made, and with a party full of young hot-headed people, that is not far off. <br/>
Good luck to AAP and better luck to BJP!

Winning election is a mean to an end, which is to improve the lives of the people. 3 years back media and nation was celebrating just like it's now, everyone thought akhilesh yadav the young cm will change the face of UP.

                            Though I hardly with any analysis of Ashutosh, fully agree with this article. Why AAP won &amp; BJP lost.<br/>
AAP with its systematic campaign took fight on neck to neck in mid Jan. Blunder of BJP started with announcement of KB as CM and then full negative campaign. From 28th Jan to 7th Feb - last 10 days, AK not only crossed BJP but became Tusanmi and rest is history. <br/><br/>
Good luck AAP

                            You can do a 10 page analysis but matter of the fact is that BJP did not lose its vote share of 31%, niether did BJP gain any. AAP did not lose its share of 30% neither did it gain any.It was en bloc shifting of congress plus 'other's vote of 21% to Aap as this bloc wanted to stop BJP.BJP's failure is that it did not increase its vote share neither it stopped the shifting of opponent vote. But its OK. BJP just needs to ensure that there are at least two parties in its opposition in any election.AAPS RISE WILL ACTUALLY HELP BJP IN LONG TERM AS IT WILL HELP SPLITTING OPPOSITION VOTES.

Do not make the same mistake of what other parties did by promising big and doing little. The mantra for success is simple. If you take care of the country and people who voted you, then you do not need to sweat for next election as your record will speak for it.  Anyway, good luck for next 5 years with less "dharna"  more "dharma" :)
