Headline::::The Shameful Persecution of Teesta Setalvad



DateTime::::2015-07-20T14:37:00+05:30




                                The news recently carried a statement made by the CBI to a special court about someone being a threat to national security. As a citizen of India, who would you consider a threat to national security?
Did you say terrorist? Not many would disagree with you. Regardless of the name of the  religion under which terrorism masquerades to kill innocent people, a terrorist is just that, a terrorist. You must have been concerned therefore, when you read that a courageous woman public prosecutor was being pressured by an officer of the premier National Investigation Agency to go soft in her prosecution of terrorists in the case in Malegaon which had killed many innocents. Your concern would have mounted by the subsequent reports that 14 prosecution witnesses in the Ajmer Sharif case had turned hostile. Yet they have not been charged with perjury. Most of them are RSS workers. One is a Minister in the Jharkhand Government. He had defected to the BJP and was rewarded. 
What is common in these cases? The acts of terror were all committed by groups acting in the name of Hindutva, in which links with top leaders of the RSS have been alleged.
But these are not the people who were being referred to as a threat to national security by the CBI.
Or, as a law-abiding citizen, you may think that if those mandated to uphold the law act like criminals, who can feel secure? In that case, you would be really concerned at recent developments when police officials who are accused in several cases of encounter killings, all of them in Gujarat, have not only got bail but been reinstated in their jobs, even as they are being tried in cases of murder. One of them is now the Additional DG of Law and Order; another has been rewarded with the post of the Superintendent of Vigilance. All the witnesses in their cases are police personnel subordinate to them. The then Home Minister of Gujarat was also an accused in the case. He was in jail for several months. Recently, the CBI Special Court exonerated him.
It was said by the learned judge that he accepted the arguments of the accused, the then Home Minister, that the 343 phone calls made by him to one of the police officers involved in the encounter killings, and the 38 calls to another in the period before and after the encounter killings, was part of the way he functioned! The CBI has not appealed against this bizarre judgement. Of course it may have something to do with the fact that the then Home Minister is now the President of the BJP.
So it was not the accused in encounter killings, all out on bail, who the CBI was referring to as a national security threat.
Could the CBI be referring to the killings of witnesses in the unfolding murder cum corruption scam in Madhya Pradesh? At least 30 mysterious deaths of witnesses or accused have occurred, but the Home Minister Rajnath Singh backs Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to say that there is absolutely no need for a CBI inquiry. It takes a public interest petition in the Supreme Court to which the Court responds by ordering a CBI inquiry. 
For the CBI, the threat is none of the above. For the CBI, the threat to national security is Teesta Setalvad, relentless campaigner for human rights and in particular for the rights of the victims of the Gujarat genocide. 
Shame on this Government for its double standards.
In the most recent case against her filed by the notorious Crime Branch of the Gujarat Government, Teesta has been accused of taking money from the Ford Foundation in violation of the Foreign Contribution Rules Act (FCRA). The Gujarat Government started an investigation into these charges. Teesta fully cooperated with the investigation, giving 25,000 pages of documentary evidence in her defence. Even as the investigation was proceeding, the Crime Branch referred the case to the Ministry of Home Affairs. Rajnath Singh, who found no reason for a CBI inquiry into the Vyapam case, who apparently did not urge  the CBI to file an appeal against the bail to policemen accused of cold-blooded murder, immediately ordered a CBI investigation into Teesta's case. Within a few days, the CBI conducted a 12-hour "raid" in Teesta's home. The CBI spokesperson in Delhi implied that "incriminating documents" had been found. In fact, as the panchnamas which are available in the public domain show, they took the same documents which Teesta had already given to the investigating team.
Teesta's work is not a threat to national security, but it does pose a threat to those who want to escape culpability for the communal murders and violence in Gujarat. Because of her work and that of her team, including her husband Javed Anand, 120 persons guilty of murder and violence have been convicted. With her support, Zakia Jaffri, the widow of Ehsan Jaffri, the Congress leader burnt to death in 2002, is fighting for justice to bring to book the top leaders involved in instigating the violence including Narendra Modi. She has thus become the target. If she had compromised, if she had given up the cases, she would not be facing the kind of constant harassment and mental torture that she is today.
Her personal accounts have been frozen. Her passport has been seized. The aim is clearly to send a strong message to those who dare to oppose the leaders of this Government and their policies: you are either with us or you face the consequences. They want to take her into their custody. They want to humiliate, defame and intimidate her today so that tomorrow other voices of dissent can be prevented. It is also a blatant misuse of power to follow a vindictive agenda.
Members of Parliament cutting through political lines have criticised the vindictive nature of the official hounding of Teesta Setalvad. They have demanded that the harassment be ended. It is a sentiment and demand widely shared by Indians across the country and the world.(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            A so called party which supported "China" during the Indo-Sino war, has so moral authority whatsoever to talk about the issues concerning national interests. Teesta, apparently has committed blunders. Talking in favour of an "accused" further shows how low Left can go. Don't oppose for the sake of opposing. Be factual. <br/><br/>
Dividing the nation by communal terms when "national interests" are in question, to gain political momentum is shameful. Parties like the CPI, TMC, Congress, SP etc., should now focus on the development of the nation rather than the development of their respective parties. That being said, it is high time for BJP to prove itself now and sack those tainted to prove themselves.

Modi and Amit Shah are not different with the support of all bhaktas. The nation learnt a lesson with the huge mistake of electing BJP into power. They are far worse than Congress, no doubt.

                            The state of investigation, prosecution and judiciary system in our country is such that we are ruled by a criminal and the ruling national party is headed by a criminal. All those who support these criminals are rewarded and those who may oppose are threatened (govt servants are busy in this). Thanks to the CPI (M) leader for writing on that when even media turns away because of low TRP potential.

                            Well written article , CPI-M can also be prosecuted for the following below:-<br/><br/>
a) Always attacking Upper caste and silence on BCs (who are more dominating)<br/>
b) Always hitting Hinduism and protecting other religions<br/>
c) Hiding the paid christian conversions<br/>
d) Not allowing BCs and SC/STs in the polit burou<br/>
e) Saying caste does not exists and passing "caste based reservations"....<br/><br/>
In the last i agree Teeda is becoming a target because she went against Modi...

                            The shocking 14th July CBI raid on Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand's home and office in Mumbai is the latest example of the impunity of this government. Under the pretext of search and seizure of documents, the raid was meant to publicly humiliate and threaten Teesta and Javed and their family. The more sinister motive is of course to remove the thorn in the government's flesh as these activists are actively pursuing the Zakia Jafri case and the Naroda Patiya appeals among many others related to the 2002 Gujarat anti-Muslim pogrom.

                            The real motive of such hounding of Ms Setalvad is nothing but a clear cut vendetta  of Modi Govt as a revenge for her active role against the 2002 Gujarat Program. She had been relentlessly continuing the legal fight for all these years so that politically influential culprits are brought to book and punished. Moreover such act of CBI can never be justified in view of Ms Setalvad already assuring her full cooperation in any investigation into transactions and functioning of her NGO.

                            Face it. Gujarat was and is akin to a police state under Modi and his team. And now since that team has shifted to Delhi, the country is slowly undergoing a similar transformation. Only those blinded by Modi's charisma are unable to see the sinister moves taking place by him, his team, RSS, and the hinduvata forces.

                            As I understand it, the common practice is when the prosecution throws the book at you, they always throw everything under the sun at you. Sad that Brinda does not have a word to say about Teesta's dishonesty. Nor does she have a word to say about her persecution of Modi. The Supreme Court has already thrown out her arguments once. As a member of the public, I'm tired of her divisive attacks. I feel sorry for Ehsan Jafri's widow, that the culprits aren't being caught, but Teesta nor Modi are not the answer.

Malegaon blast case: six years of investigations and not a charge sheet filed against Purohit, Thakur et al. But they continue to languish in jail even today.Meanwhile, the six SIMI activists get exonerated and roam free. Why? Why does'nt ur heart bleed at this injustice to Hindus?<br/><br/>
Vyapam: It commenced during Digvijay singh's tenure. Most of the death occurred over a six year period. And the most recent case(Akshay Singh) turned out to be a genuine heart attack case as was confirmed by both the AIIMS &amp; the Gujarat autopsy reports. Why din't u mention the obvious Congi involvement in Vyapam? Can u truly be unaware that investigating in to Vyapam's (2500 accussed) would require tremendous man power resources which the CBI simply doesn't have? Was it the Commie-Cong objective to scuttle the Vyapam probe by handing it over to the CBI? Has any court made a single negative observation of the conduct of the Vyapam investigation by the state SIT?<br/><br/>
Coming to Gujarat, why don't u in the Commie, Congi, MSM,Sickular fraternity ever lose sleep over the Hindus of S-6, who were burnt alive in the coach at Godhra? Why do u deliberately overlook the fact that 258 Hindus also were killed in the riots? Doesn't the figure tell u something? that it was indeed a Riot and not a Pogrom or Genocide that had occurred? or is it ur case that Hindu lives are expendable? or that Hindus don't matter in ur scheme of vote bank politics?<br/><br/>
Why din't u work with the same fervour for 5000 SIKHs killed during 84 riots? Not a single conviction till date? Why don't u ever raise an issue over the fact that over 5000 muslims were massacred in six hours in the Nellie riots and not a single Congi leader was booked? Or in bhagalpur riots which killed more than 2000 muslims? or in Meerut? There are atleast 10 major riots in which more than 2500 Muslims have been killed since 1947 in Cong ruled states. And yet no CM or Cong leader has ever been booked or held to account for the obvious cases of GENOCIDES/POGROMS WHY?<br/><br/>
Ur political tilt and the "Sickular" propensities in favour of Congress and anti-BJP agenda is all too obvious, Lady. Commies screwed up governance in Kerala &amp; in Bengal. Do u wish that the same happen all over India? <br/><br/>
As for Setalvad, the less said the better. If she is indeed that clean, why does she have to tutor members of the Jaffri family to lie in Court? IS it not wilful assistance to perjury? Why doesn't she account for the money she has received from the Foreign agencies? Why was the money received DIVERTED for purposes not meant for? Ask her to come clean befor u launch tirades against the Government. The Commies, Congi, NGOs do not care for the Hindus of this nation. But u forget the fact that the Hindu of today is better informed and is fully aware of ur anti-hindu politics. And we r not forgetting this, Brinda ji.

                            Good job by CBI. Teesta was illegally receiving funds from ISI, USA, Middle East etc. For national security, her bail plea must be rejected.

                            One Modi hater coming to rescue of another is a hilarious scene. Brinda Karat is a kind of person who is so blind folded by her speudo-secularism that it futile to logically argue with her. However if any sanity is remaining in her then she should  remember that the actions against Teesta are initiated against the complained registered by the very people she earlier represented. Her Crimes involve taking maoney from Foreigners and enjoy goodies in the name of victims of riots. There are many deserving people in India who need attension of powerful person like Brinda and she should concentrate on them instead of wasting time on Teesta.

                            Brinda Karat obviously does not read the newspapers. She would have known that Teesta Setalvad and her cohorts had received illegal foreign money which was being investigated. This is not a witch hunt. Every citizen has to respect the laws of the land. Teesta and Brinda are free to approach the courts and claim compensation and damages if it is found that the raids were unjustified. But were they? Is it Brinda's stand that all those she supports are not to be investigated for their illegal activities? That is not surprising. Brinda belongs to the CPM. They were notorious for mass murder, violence and other criminal activities when they were in power in Kerala and West Bengal. The voters kicked them out in both states. Even there, CPM honchos like Brinda were vociferous in demanding that these crimes should not be investigated. The police in both states were coerced into not taking action against hardened criminals used by the CPM to loot and terrorise people. This is public knowledge and anyone in those states, including the CPM cadres, will tell you this. So now it is fabulous that someone from the CPM is teaching the Government of India on how they should deal with lawbreakers. No wonder that within 10 years the CPM will only remain as a memory in India. People like Brinda and criminal parties like the CPM have no place in modern India.

However the tide has now changed, people have understood that Teesta is nothing but a Liar. The lefts will obviously support Teeta, no surprises. I hope the government handles this matter sternly and this should be a strong lesson to all hypocrites and so called human rights activists.

What did these people do when they were ruling in Kerala and WB.  In Kerala, specificially, was it not the cadre which used to decide who should be put in lock-up and transfers in Govt.  Less said the better.  Teesta might have been doing a tremendous work as far as Muslims killed in riots.  In the same manner Hindus were also killed.  May to a lesser extent.  Is she is taking up anything.  Truth is not everyone wants.  Convenience and activism to be in the picture always and in news.  Communication is what is important in this age, and whoever is good in that, they do well.  Media is also  after them for news.  This is the truth.  Truth many times is hidden and no one is ready to bring it out.

The govt. has something on her and it most likely is use of foreign donations to work for a foreign donor.<br/><br/>

He has been offered Reward for that.It is beyond doubt that Teesta Setalwad is ha sbeen getting huge funds Regarding Anti National Aspect Proofs shall be there.Another instance is the Case of Dr Binayak Sen who has been convicted by a Sessions Court in Chattisgadh for TREASON.All these Leftists made a Hue and Cry and led processions.Amarthya Sen led a Procession in Network with 40 Nobel Laureates.

What is shameful is people in the press supporting high profile accused such as Teesta, movie stars etc.  If the evidence shows that Teesta did not do any wrong, she will be acquitted.  If not, she should be convicted.

                            Why are the left &amp; Congress fellows assuming that Teesta is innocent? Just because she fought for riot victims? What about cases filed against her by the same riot victims? Are they supported by Modi too? What about Bilkis Bano case? Have they forgotten all of that? What about Teesta's reaction to Godhra train burning? What about embezzlement case filed against her by Gulmarg Society members? The same Gulmarg where Ehsan Jafri died? Are all these people supporters of Modi?<br/><br/>
What Teesta, via her masters in Congress, did for so many years was pure vindictiveness. How does someone running a NGO get support from all the top lawyer's who rush to defend her in SC? How does a person running a NGO get politicians to support her so openly? By the way, this NGO business is really lucrative. There are more NGO's per 100 people in India then cops. Most of them mushroomed during Sonia's government flouting all rules. Today they are being asked to simply comply with legal requirements. Why can't Teesta comply with the laws of the land? Why does she want special treatment? Why does she think she is above the law of the land? Why do Congress, left and all politicians want Teesta to be treated above the law?

                            I hope the BJP is really tough on foreign funding and if they are ....they should start with themselves as they have been convicted of accepting foreign funding by the High Courts .....stifling all activists, calling anybody who opposes BJP as anti national will only last till a short time ....as you sow , so shall you reap......if a day comes when we get a really honest leadership that day both BJP and Cong can shut shop and start jail time........ and its not far as no dictatorship has ever survived for long...

                            Let law take its course if she and her husband comes out clean you take a position. Politicos taking position on judicial/legal matters is a big nuisance. Being law makers you have to more responsible.

                            Madam We were shamed enough all these years along, We were shamed when the sovereignty of the country was put on stake undermining the Judgement of courts and our parliamentarians started signature campaign against their own country's sitting CM ,rather than standing to-gether as Countrymen against any outcast from any body around the world<br/><br/>
Today u writing the same is telling the world , see how oppressed we are as if the King has been De-throned by some enemy.<br/><br/>
stop looking Our great nation as some Banana Republic and Start feeling some Proud On The BIG BINDI u put on your fore-head

                            The difference was that in the Teesta case, a PM of the Indian Govt. was being accused of MURDER. That makes it an issue for the Home Ministry and a very urgent one. <br/><br/>
The CBI may have found an email from a Ford Foundation employee that is very simple saying "Modi must be stopped from being the PM of India at all cost". And that coming from a foreign organization and Teesta working towards that agenda justifies hanging Teesta by a rope in the middle of the Supreme Court.

                            it is being conveniently ignored what the courts have said about her/her company. She is free to file any appeal in any court for what's going on right now. Oh wait... why doesnt Mrs Karat file for a PIL on the matter?
