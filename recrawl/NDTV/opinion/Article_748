Headline::::Modi Government's Complacency Hit By Reality



DateTime::::2015-08-10T15:28:00+05:30




                                Every economic problem to be solved assumes a political problem has been solved before it. The government forgot this important lesson, and now it has to beat a hasty retreat on the Land Bill.
 
In matters of economic policy, the Modi government is dogged by the criticism that it has failed to bring any new ideas to the table. So far, most of its initiatives are a continuation of the UPA's schemes, repackaged with much fanfare. It came closest to a change, albeit a small one, when it tried to amend the 2013 Land Acquisition Act. Its failure to do so raises some critical questions about the so-called reform agenda and the Prime Minister's resolve to push it through.
 
Supporters will point to the missing majority in the Rajya Sabha. Clinging to this excuse will not obscure the fact that this government has displayed a legislative and political timidity that stands in stark contrast to its energetic campaign before the Lok Sabha elections. We know from Narasimha Rao's example that policy acumen and political charisma need not go hand in hand. Unless it gets its act together fast, the Modi government seems poised to prove that again, only in reverse.
 
Having the numbers is neither necessary nor sufficient for major legislative action. What is needed is a vision backed up by well-thought-out ideas, belief in those ideas and skill in parliamentary maneuvers like log-rolling and alliance-building. Rao's minority government managed to fundamentally alter the course of India's economy. The balance of payments crisis provided some political cover but pulling it off was still a remarkable feat.
 
In contrast, the current government's game has lacked conviction inside parliament, and has been worse outside. Perhaps the thinking was that a decisive electoral mandate will automatically translate into popular support for whatever it tries to do, and an emaciated Opposition will simply roll over. This complacence has now met with a strong dose of reality. The push to remove the consent requirement and social impact assessment from the 2013 Act, without even touching the jacked-up compensation amounts, was quickly and successfully branded as anti-farmer by opponents. The government's feeble attempts to erase this taint came to nothing. The subsequent retreat has less to do with parliamentary arithmetic than the message war, which it lost badly. 
 
What does this spell for the prospect of reforms? 'Reforms' is a buzzword among a section of the intelligentsia that was disenchanted with the Congress's 'populist' policies, and perhaps saw in Narendra Modi an Indian version of Reagan or Thatcher. Broadly speaking, populists emphasize the need to make a frontal assault on poverty straight away, while reformists stress measures that boost productivity and growth as a means to tackle poverty in the long run. While these two goals are not always in conflict, there is a simmering tension between them that is never far from the surface. 
 
One example is the budgetary question of whether to spend more on the social sector or on things like power and infrastructure. Land acquisition is another issue where the conflict looms, since many of the measures that protect the interests of farmers may make industrialisation difficult and expensive.
 
In India, where the average voter is poor and rural, how policies are framed in the public mind assumes great importance, therefore. Populists have an advantage since the pro-poor impact of policies like NREGA, the Food Security Act or farm loan waivers is immediate and apparent. Reforms in labour law, business regulation, infrastructure financing and land acquisition rules seem either distant from voters' interests or in opposition to them. The reformists have their task cut out, especially with elections in large agrarian states like Bihar just round the corner.
 
The Opposition's framing of the economic agenda as the government is working to help big business at the cost of the poor will tend to stick since it is prima facie plausible. Selling reforms to poor voters requires a much more difficult framing: that sarkar is not indifferent to their plight but is practicing tough love; that it has embarked on a path which will bring larger but delayed rewards to the loyal. In the context of the land bill, the government's challenge was to convince farmers that the prospect of industrialisation and alternative livelihoods made it worth putting up with fewer protections.
 
Arvind Panagariya, the head of NITI Aayog, has long advocated a strongly growth-oriented reformist philosophy, but many people will say that trickle-down does not work without enabling government policies. Economists like Amartya Sen have argued that a lot of assistance to the poor is not merely dole but investment in a productive work force through improvements in health, education and skills. Irrespective of whichever side one wishes to lean on in this debate, it appears that the reformists overestimated this government's ability to persuade voters about the merit of their ideas, or even its own commitment to those ideas. 
 
Modi's campaign brilliantly tapped into the aspirations of the electorate. That it was rather vague on the road map to acche din was an advantage in the elections, but is proving to be a drag in governance. Rapid economic change is always associated with pain and uncertainty, especially if the strategy is to move away from populism. The government finds itself in a situation where it has encouraged many dreams but has not created the political ground for any tough choices that are necessary for fulfilling them. 
 
The main flaw of the UPA's Land Acquisition Act is that its compensation formula is completely top-down and ad hoc, which is why cumbersome procedural safeguards like consent and social impact assessment had to be stacked on to it. A more rational method of determining compensation, through competitive land auctions for example, would have made these superfluous and created an acquisition process that is both smooth and just. We will have to wait and see if the 2013 Act manages to lift us out of the quagmire. If not, the government will have a bigger problem to solve.(Maitreesh Ghatak is Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics and Parikshit Ghosh is Associate Professor of Economics at the Delhi School of Economics.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            History will never forgive BJP for wasting huge mandate of people. People brought them to power for reducing corruption and development of India. But BJP has other agendas, to protect minsters with impropriety, to carry forward ghar wapsi, to keep silence on church attacks, to enforce cow protection, to demoralize other communities, to thrash and rebuke opposition despite having minority in rajya sabha, to show aggressive postures towards pakistan, to create false scenario of development by bullet trains, make in india. It is sheer waste of our votes.

                            What a moronic logic that you have to bring new Idea in order to impress some wannabe analysts. In one of his interviews before elections Arun Shourie categorically said that Modi will make sure the old policies are made more workable and result oriented with authoritative persuasion.

                            Its funny how the criticism of Indian economic policies largely stems from the fact that every time the government changes, the policies changes as well. Finally, we have somebody trying to make the previous policies work (with the required fixes and updates, of course) and they get criticised for not making new policies. Unfortunately, we have become too accustomed to a newly formed government destroying the policies of the previous governments (resulting in closure of unfinished massive projects in the middle and waste of tax payers money) that we don't like anybody who is trying to fix that. <br/>
Way to go! (oh ya, brand me a bhakt or whatever you want to. you know the best!)

                            I am no fan of the current government and especially their attempts to impose Hinduvta down our throats when the campaign was about development, but this article in not a balanced evaluation. (The authors have praised the UPA's economies policies before the elections). It is true that the kind of broad legislative overhauls that the government should ideally have achieved didn't happen - like comprehensive land or labor reform. But these issues are so controversial that the government has rightly decided to leave it to the states. And unlike UPA, they have signaled that if any state government passes forward looking laws in these areas, the central government will support it. So a competition among states is emerging (to pass more business friendly laws and bring investment) and it will intensify in future. Additionally there are many other areas which doesn't require major legislation where the current government has been far more energetic. In two crucial areas, building infrastructure and cutting red tape, the current government has taken major steps which were not taken by the previous government locked in ideological battles. Today India is among the most promising emerging economies in Asia - India is expected to grow at rates that are higher than most major economies. A company like Foxconn betting big on India is part of that. All this would not have happened under UPA3 - that's why people kicked them out.

                            Mr ghosh and ghatak , forget all jargon.  Face the reality. Bengal is a failed state in terms of economic model. Where as gujarat and maharashtra are progressing by the hour. If centre starts listening to you text bookish thesis, we also would land up in 'Poribartan' madness &amp; end up in shutting down industries. Wether UPA or NDA , both are better than Nonsense Leftists &amp; impulsive  mamta baneejee.

                            How convenient to compare Modi with Rao. One must not forget that no political party was trying rip through Rao for everything he did as a against every single party that'S not part of NDA and even every single person who did not vote for BJP is trying to find faults in every single word spoken by Modi. Of course they are entitled to their opinion but the stupidity must also have some rationale to be accepted as one's opinion. <br/><br/>
Well, its actually nothing new that so many people would oppose a person trying to change the way things work. But its definitely unfortunate for the country and neutral people like me who have long supported everyone who is trying to do something good for the country but I guess those days will never come.

                            Author'a anguish is understandable that reforms are not taking place at expected pace. It is true that Modi and BJP are not trying to build consensus in parliament. But it is not timidity as author thinks. I believe it is a strategy. In last 3 terms (including NDA-I) alliance were built on opportunism instead of trust. Regional parties used to blackmail major stake holder. While CBI etc were used to tame regional parties. There is no assurance that rushing reforms will induce faster growth. PV did not rush any reforms. He rather 'introduced' reforms. Vajpayee had shown some haste and eventually paid for it. Couple of more states under their rule, BJP should be able to demonstrate reforms in better way.

                            Can 'competitive land auctions' ever be fair in cases where a clutch of farmers own small pieces of land? Who can monitor 20,000 or so land auction transactions? Is that possible. Best way out is make compensation so attractive that farmers readily give their consent to sell.

                            We need totally new ideas for the country to leap-frog. There are enough people to take advantage of any change for their personal benefit. Capitalism became crony capitalism and NPAs, Socialism became populism, reservations led to mediocrity.

                            The real roblem wit Modi and his BJP teamis that they expect things to go their way merely because of their mandate at the polls. One lesson in democracy is that poliicians take themselves too seriously at their own peril. The mandate to Modi was more a rejection of he Congress Govt,which Modi brilliantly exposed during his campaigns. Now n power, Modi is floudering! He seems so surpised that any opposition is even possible, shs how ill prepared he was tolead 1.2 billion Indians
