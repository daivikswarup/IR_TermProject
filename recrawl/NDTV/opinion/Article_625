                            Mani - The language and history "scholar", the master of trivia who has lived on public money (Rajya Sabha MP) has contributed little to nothing in public service but has audacity to blog his useless views and criticisms here every week. Can anybody even in 70s not be enlightened that he is PAID PUBLIC SERVANT and he is PAID to contribute to our country. Meaningless criticism, harping on the past is not contributing to the cause of 1.25 billion people who are paying Mani every day to feed him. But Mani's huge ego  Not realize this basic fact and he wastes this public money in meaningless criticism that does not add value to the 1.25 billion people that is paying to feed Mani. For example, Modi is trying to bring meaningful changes to the Land Acquisition bill that congress had tabled. Mani does not here in his blogs ever articulate what clauses he is opposed to and why and provide supportive evidence for his rationale. Instead he sticks to his "suit-boot" arguments and meaningless obstructionism. What an insult to the 1.25 billion people feeding Mani. Does Mani care ? No he thinks this is his entitlement. After all Mani is a language and history "scholar" and he is subservient to 'The' family. It doesn't matter if he is contributing to the 1.25 billion people.

At the worst they have scored 4  and at the best 7.5  and if take the average its around 5.5 to 6.0  out of 10.<br/><br/>
Which is not bad for  a first time govt which has inherited the mess from a previous govt.<br/><br/>
Not a BJP supporter but have full hope that they will do far better than the UPA/Congress govt in 5 years of there term

                            I am not sure why this guy is still allowed to write articles that are full of hatred and no substance. Before grading the current Government, if Mr. Mani can grade his own Government and the state of affairs when they passed it on to the new Government, then we can have a fair comparison. During the UPA rule, nobody in India were having acche din except the corrupt Congress politicians. Now, at least the businesses are flourishing (that means Government exchequer will get some Tax that can be used for Countrie's growth). Having a leader who is not afraid to lead from the front is better than a PM who is afraid to talk and requires permission from PROXIES for everything.

                            Dude, How much time you spent to figure out words to tie back to the alphabets? I wish you would have spent that time in nation building activities like planting a couple of trees or helping a physically challenged cross a road on busy day, or distributing 10 glasses of cold water on a hot sunny day! None of these cost any money. Just needs good will and the time you spent on writing this blog. If you are running out of ideas, just let me know, I can guide you. I am right around the corner watching you. I am the "Common Man".

                            Seems, NDTV keeps Mani's articles for its readers to make fun on this senile clown. Mani had to eat his own words on Modi being India's PM....! He still is a slave of Gandhi Dynasty. Duty bound.

                            A book of his silly blogs! That takes the cake. But vastly amusing, if totally incorrect and pointless. Aiyer venting his venom on Modi reminds me of the village dogs barking at the elephant walking by. More than the blogs, the comments are really entertaining. But Aiyer keeps barking nevertheless. Shows what abject sycophancy and a thick skin can achieve. Really nothing.

                            Mani Shankar Aiyar is a negative person who just criticize Modi for the sake of criticizing. He has been eating his own words that a chai wala can't become PM. The Congress is still not able to digest that a non-congress man can run this country better than Congress. The congress wants to be in power as they are power hungry party. Can Mr. Aiyar justifies 60 years of Congress misrule?

                            A is for Acolyte. Which MSA is to the Gandhis and the Congress.<br/>
B is for Bitter. Because neither MSA nor the Congress has any more hope in hell.<br/>
C is for Chamcha. Enough said. <br/>
D is for Dumbfounded. That's what NaMo has done to MSA.<br/>
E is for Enough. Seriously, don't you have anything else to say week after week, Mani?<br/>
F is for Fullstop. NDTV, stop giving this idiot a platform to express his one track mind. <br/>
G is for Googly. Clean bowled MSA and Congress. <br/>
H is for Hoodwinking. It's what MSA and Con-gress have been doing since 1947.<br/>
I is for Imbecile. Self explanatory.<br/>
J is for Joker. Ditto.<br/>
K is for Hindi word for Dog. <br/>
L is for Lampoon. That's all what MSA knows to do.<br/>
M is for Mani Shankar Aiyar. The one and only of his kind, thankfully.<br/>
N is for Nepotism. MSA's only quality which has kept him alive. <br/>
O is for Opportunist. It's what makes a Chamcha survive. <br/>
P is for Pessimist. MSA's outlook to life. <br/>
Q is for Quisling. MSA should be booked for sedition, methinks.<br/>
R is for Rascal. Nothing more to add.<br/>
S is for Scumbag. Again, nothing more to add.<br/>
T is for Tyrant. Create fear, raise a bogey, keep yourself alive.<br/>
U is for Uxury. Typical intellectual/zamindar mentality. <br/>
V is for Vanity. Which MSA has heaps of.<br/>
W is for Wishing. MSA and Congress need a lot of that.<br/>
X is for XRay. A Roentgen examination of his thick skull is imperative. <br/>
Z is for Zzzzzzz....what MSA's posts evoke in people to dare to read him.

                            Mani - A seasoned politician like you can do better than write a primary school going child like blog. Seriously, its not funny nor does it feel good for such a source. Look at how Tharoor writes and take some inspiration. By the way, I used to be a congress supporter once and now am a Modi Fan. He gets things done unlike the congress. And BTW do remember one thing, when you point one finger at others, 4 point at you. Take your first letter A - Well BJP lost but so did congress!!! At least BJP won 3, Congress was wiped out. So please get your facts right, get your house in order and please stop being a primary school prose writer.

                            Iyer is still very bitter, and with good reason. However, he should be bitter with his Congress for they are the ones who sidelined him because of his cynical outlook and twisted thinking. He is now trying to come back into the good books of the First Family of Congress by launching diatribes against the BJP. Iyer probably believes that with a tally of 44 seats, he stands a good chance of making "big bang" noise. The problem is Iyer has always been a "has been" and never the person for the moment. He needs to retrospect, why Congress is down to 44 seats in the first place. Wake up and smell twitter. It spreads the news in seconds and the truth will out! irrespective of how you try to package your deeds!

                            Hear what Pradip Baijal says," Whatever I discussed with PMS(PM), every word was known to Dayanidhi Maran. He says MMS, P Chidambaram and Kapil Sibal all knew 2G scam and working in tandem in guiding CBI what to inquire and what to hide." This is really shameful, disgusting and criminal too. <br/>
Dear Mani, do you have any answer for this? Rather than answering such serious questions, you, PC and Sibal just write articles. It is not your articles but your money is getting printed in media.

                            MS, this is hilarious stuff. You do have a sense of humor. Now let's get back to serious stuff. Stop cribbing about the fact that you are increasingly becoming a liability for Congress. Rhyming this ABC might give you goodie points with Rahul baba...

                            When some member of our 'highly' informed masses comment that 'Modi is doing nothing' I wish they could give some illustration of what Modi could have done but has not done. It is because of such subsidy seeking masses that UPA has been able to rule for so long and devastate the economy to this sad state.
