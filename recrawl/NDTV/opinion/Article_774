Headline::::Why Pakistani Army is Needling Modi



DateTime::::2015-08-21T22:28:00+05:30




                                It is convenient to say the confusion over the National Security Advisor (NSA) level talks is the result of a fitful and unpredictable Pakistan policy on the part of the Narendra Modi government. However, this is both true and untrue.
There is no doubt the Modi government's approach to Pakistan in the past 15 months has seen shifts. It has oscillated between no engagement and placing red lines that were difficult to defend, between agreeing to Foreign Secretary level talks prematurely (in May 2014 itself) and a strong and - in strictly military terms - disproportionate response to provocations by the Pakistani army on the border.
Having said that, the current drama, and the questions about whether the Pakistani NSA will actually turn up, cannot really be blamed on the past year. For a few months now, and the Ufa (Russia) meeting of the two prime ministers reflected this, Modi has realised a certain degree of engagement is unavoidable and indeed to be recommended. If nothing else, it keeps communication lines open and reassures the international community and other SAARC countries that India is sufficiently engaged with its most challenging neighbourhood relationship.
Of course, both Modi and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif acknowledge this is not the moment for blockbuster conversations, and that there is no domestic political capital on either side to discuss solutions to Kashmir and so on. Conditions are not what they were in the early 2000s. In Ufa, both Prime Ministers agreed to a limited engagement plan, with formal talks on terrorism in Delhi, even if other issues were mentioned in passing, as always happens when officials meet for hours. This would lead to a second meeting in a couple of months and start a series. Both sides were testing the waters.
The problem really is the Pakistani side, particularly the army, has come to realise the Indians are keen to be seen as engaging. The Pakistanis are calculating they can provoke the Indians - by firing on the border, making statements about how Kashmir must and will be discussed, and sending out invitations to the Hurriyat leadership - but that the Modi government would not want to be perceived as the spoiler yet again, and would not want to call off talks.
Essentially, the bet is the Indian side does not have the space to repeat what it did when it cancelled the Foreign Secretaries' talks in 2014, on a similar issue of Pakistani officials meeting the Hurriyat.
Why is the Pakistani army so needling Modi? It is not just about making him pay for the snubbing of a year ago. It is because conditions in Afghanistan have changed in the past year and increased Islamabad's strategic comfort. Yes, there are minefields for Pakistan as well. The announcement of the death of Mullah Omar, who Inter-Services Intelligence was claiming was in agreement with its "peace plan" even when he was actually dead - has weakened the Pakistani hand. It has brought into question the army's claim that it can deliver a deal between the Taliban and the government in Kabul.
Yet, this cannot take away from the bigger picture that the West and the United States have bought into the idea that the stabilisation of Afghanistan necessitates the providing of some role and influence for Pakistan. This equation was not as clear cut in, say, May 2014. As such, irrespective of whether Modi had engaged or not engaged with Pakistan from Day One, Pakistan's (and the Pakistani army's) response was bound to have changed between then and now - for reasons absolutely unrelated to India or its Prime Minister.
Through its history Pakistan's army has been tactically proficient but strategically deficient. If it insists on the Hurriyat meeting as a pre-condition to the NSA talks and the talks are called off - essentially if the Modi government calls its bluff - then how will it (the Pakistan army) explain its action? India can always make the case that it could not allow the Hurriyat to be seen as the legitimate representative of the Kashmiri people, over and above the elected government of Jammu and Kashmir and bypassing even the ruling People's Democratic Party.
On the other hand Pakistan would essentially have said it prefers meeting the Hurriyat to meeting the government of India - and has made a meeting with the Hurriyat a precondition to any meeting with the government of India on any subject. Such grandstanding may suit General Raheel Sharif, but New Delhi believes that is not an approach that finds favour with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who privately admits domestic and public support for the Kashmir cause is ebbing.Â 
Is the world going to be sympathetic to a Pakistan that turns down an invitation for bilateral talks because it would rather have a chat with Hurriyat busybodies who are anyway losing relevance? The Hurriyat was a creation of American and British diplomats in the early 1990s. Those original godfathers have long orphaned it, leaving the Pakistan army as the only foster parent.
That is why the eventual fate of the NSA talks will be decided not in Delhi, but in who wins the more important standoff between the Military HQ in Rawalpindi and the Prime Minister's Office in Islamabad. India can live to fight (and talk) another day.(The author is senior fellow, Observer Research Foundation.

                            Excellent article. In effect, India is not going to lose. I understand that Secretary of State at the time Albright, had a major say in creation of Hurriyat. Why was it done? Because India's ruling party for years and years badly mismanaged its position at an international level. Kashmir was always mismanaged by Congress. In effect, it had no policy. Under PM Modi, India is carrying out a much needed change.

                            Nice article, Ashok Malik. It is true that Modi's government is oscillating in Pakistan issue. It seems Modi is stuck between befitting response and economical reforms. However, I am happy that at least this government stops the hurriyat leaders meet with Pakistan diplomats. We Indians are so pathetic that we have made our minds these days to get happy about these miniature things. Other than that, no matter which government rules India, India is gradually becoming soft towards Pakistan. I dont pretend as though I dont want to punish them at least for Mumbai attacks..

                            Pak behaving just like congress shortly after 2014 general elections. BJP lost good number of by-elections (lol! congress got some of them) within months of LS win. Congress went on declaring Modi wave out. With-in months BJP formed government in 4 of 5 assemblies. It will be same for Pakistan. Once its army lose edge in Afghanistan, it will go quiet.

                            Pakistan Army is needling Modi because they know Modi has myopic detractors who hate him as he is here to pull India out of congresserian curse of perpetual mediocrity. They know Modi can be made a polarizing factor as plenty of vicious propaganda and misconceptions are already institutionalized against him in India. Unsettling and challenging Modi will give plenty of ammunition to domestic detractors/trolls thus sure shot propaganda advantage which is very important for every military and strategic misadventure Pakistan army would like to mount against India. Since Modi has become PM every opposition party and media crook sounds like Pakistan apologists; tell a lot about why Pakistan will target the state head Modi with impunity.

                            At the moment, the Pakistani army feels completely pushed into acorner. In Afghanistan, the US, Russia &amp; China enabled it to get a place at the table by keeping out India. Pakistan promised to bring Taliban to the negotiating table but subsequent events have got the Afghans &amp; Chinese upset. The US has now taken a position that the Pakistani army claims of taking on terrorists is false and not supported by factual evidence. The actual situation is that the Pakistani army generals are scared.

                            Seriously, why at all do summit diplomacy when you cannot even enforce the basic things that are agreed/signed?!!  When two LEADERS sign a document (in Ufa), everything should have been sorted out to the last dot.. Looks like Modiji just signs documents, but cannot enforce a damn..<br/><br/><br/>
See Obama handles negotiations: he does whole ton of back channel diplomacy, clinches the deal *and* then  meets the leaders.. Modiji is just doing photo ops without any concrete ground work.. Whoever advising Modiji is an idiot, or MOdiji is too idiotic  to listen to sound, diplomatic advice...<br/><br/>
Modiji is making India look like a LAUGHING stock.

                            Pakistan can not get sympathy on the pretext of failing to have bilateral talks because India does not want Hurriyat to be consulted. Creators of Hurriyat had deserted it for solid reasons and they will be pleased with India's stand.

                            It is useless to microscopic inspection of issue.Pakistan's hostility to India is permanent. Pakistan army and elected government compliment each other in achieveing desired objective.<br/>
    Pakistan is behaving as if they are going to dictate terms to India.Why not ,having atom bomb and China to it's side and blessings of America it is posing threat  to piece and stability in the region.<br/>
       Modi's problem is he do not take opposition in confidence and takes opposition support for granted the same way Vajpayee used to practice. The wrong doing of Vajpayee enabled Pakistan to acquire atom bomb and India lost all suprimacy over Pakistan.<br/>
       One step forward and two step backward approach of Modi will lead us no where. Roaming around the world is one thing and prevailing upon is another.<br/>
       Sushma's silence is defining. So Mr. Modi need of the hour is play as team and don't try to take credit only for you yourself.
