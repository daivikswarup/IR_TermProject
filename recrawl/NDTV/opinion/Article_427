Headline::::Modi, Ever the RSS Pracharak



DateTime::::2015-02-23T14:57:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)
	The 56-inch mountain has at long last heaved - and produced the proverbial mouse.
	After eight months of maun vrata over issues of religious tension, Narendra Modi has now disclosed that his "government will ensure that there is complete freedom of faith" and "will not allow any religious group, belonging to the majority or the minority, to incite hatred against others, overtly or covertly".
	Excellent - except that this is what he should have said - and done - at the Shah Alam refugee camp in Ahmedabad in 2002 when an anti-Muslim pogrom was taking place under his watch.  There was neither a word of sympathy then, nor any action to establish that his Government was with the victims, not the perpetrators.  Indeed, it was not until he was compelled to accompany Prime Minister Vajpayee to the Shah Alam camp a full month later that he even made his first visit to the camp.  And when, finally, a word of sympathy came from him a decade or so later, it was to compare the murdered, injured and looted Muslims to a puppy dog accidently coming under the wheels of a car.
	Nor is this the first time Modi has declared  that he "strongly condemn(s) State violence".  He had said it before to the BJP's Parliamentary Party.  But with what result?  Only the filthy statements from those he selected to represent his Party in the Lok Sabha and adorn his Council of Ministers.  Perhaps he cannot deprive Sakshi Maharaj of his seat but by what standards does he continue to include Sadhvi Jyoti among his Ministers?  In the behavior of a whole cohort of his most ardent supporters, there is no indication that "equal respect for all religions" is in their "DNA".  If they do not have that in their DNA - as manifestly they do not- what are they doing sitting beside and behind him in Parliament?
	And talking of Parliament, why did Modi so adamantly refuse to come to the Rajya Sabha and say exactly what he did to the Syrian Christians? The Opposition was demanding no more.  They wanted him to unequivocally declare on the floor of the sacred precincts of Parliament that he "consider(ed) the freedom to have, to retain and to adopt, a religion or belief (as) a personal choice of a citizen". He did not because he was afraid of being questioned about the gap between such an oral declaration and the ugly effects of ghar waapsi, love jihad and election-oriented riots strewed around him.
	The RSS pracharak in Modi is manifested in virtually every sentence of his speech.  Note that all his quotes come from Hindu religious texts.  He finds nothing in the Dhammapada or the Holy Quran, in the Zend Avesta or the Torah or even the Guru Granth Saheb to share with his audience.  He talks of "spiritual exchanges thousands of years back" between "the Indian saints and Greek sages", but rears away from even hinting at the spiritual exchanges between Muslim saints and Hindu sages over more than a thousand years that have given rise to the synthesis of spiritualism that defines the whole of India today. Nor does Modi's constricted conflation of "India" with "Hindu" allow him to talk expansively of the profound influence of Buddhism and Jainism on Hindu spiritual thought and traditions and over most of the period from Asoka (3rd century BC) to Harshvardhan (7th century AD) - that is close to a millennium - which eventually gave rise to Sankara's Advaita which resolved the age-long disputation within the Hindu fold of whether Mind or Matter are one or separate.  No, his quotes are all from Rig Veda and "ancient Indian sayings".  Nothing from Guru Nanak or Guru Gobind Singh, nothing from the saints of the Bhakti Movement.  Indeed, given  that Modi was in a Christian church,  neither he nor his speechwriters could find anything  to cite from the Bible or more recent Christian philosophers.  Surely, Gandhiji's devotion to "Lead Kindly Light" or the Sermon on the Mount could have found more reflection in his remarks.
	"Spiritualism", said Modi, "is rooted in India's heritage".  Of course it is.  But it is a spiritualism that derives from India being  a confluence of virtually every religion the world has or has known.  Compare any page of Jawaharlal Nehru's Discovery of India and Modi's speech, and the gap becomes glaring between a truly profound understanding of India's numerous spiritual traditions and Modi's one-way street. For Modi to affirm, however, that important religions have gone into the making of India's contemporary spiritual heritage would be to deny Savarkar's fundamental proposition that only those Indians are genuine Indians who regard India as not only their "pitrubhoomi" but also their "punyabhoomi".  That is precisely why he spoke of "Mother India" having given "birth to many religious and spiritual streams" but completely ignored the many religions and spiritual streams that have come into India, that have been imported into our cultures and civilization over and over again.  Consider the contrast between Modi's boast that "some of them (religions born in India) have even travelled beyond Indian borders" with sidelining the religions born outside India but which have travelled into India, crossing Indian borders and becoming part and parcel of our composite Hindu and non-Hindu heritage.  Modi's speech privileges those religions born within India over those whose origins lie elsewhere.  That is not the Hindu tradition.  It is Hindutva at its most naked.
	Let us not forget that when Modi presented a copy of the Gita to the Emperor of Japan, he sneered that "secularists" back home would object. That is to totally misunderstand "secularism".  Secularism is not about being anti-Hindu or anti-Gita.  We secularists regard the Gita as integral to not just the Hindu Way of Life, but the Indian Way of Life.  We would also applaud Modi presenting a copy of the Holy Quran, printed at the Darul Uloom, to Prime Minister Koirala when he next visits Kathmandu; or of Dara Shikoh's Persian translation of the Upanishads to Nawaz Sharif were Modi to ever meet Sharif again; or even a copy of the Torah printed in Jew Town, Kochi to the Israeli President:  that would be to give full expression to India's pluralism.  It is in the active celebration of all of its faiths and beliefs, in rejoicing that all things Indian are not only Hindu, in bringing together all Indians instead of sequestering some of them in khaki half-pants in Nagpur, that the true spirit of India lies.
	The time now is for Modi to fulfill - particularly with respect to his own Sangh Parivar and associated outfits - that he really will "act strongly in this regard."Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            congress was in power for 60 years in India. If they were truly secular and wanted India to be a true secular nation, they would have implemented uniform civil code from 1950.With uniform civil code and uniform population code, India would not have faced any communal riots and all citizens would have identified with nation only and religion would have been within their personal self. Today because of Congress secularism,Indians are identified by secular political parties by religion and given benefits and reservation based on religion  for votes. with uniform population code for all Indians across all religions, we would have eliminated poverty and would have had more resources for all Indians and no need to give benefits based on religion which is going on because of congress party's secularism. Why is Mani talking when his party has taken India on the wrong route for so many years and caused so many communal riots and poverty.

He quotes from Gita or Gifts Gita doesnt mean that he is communal and has hatred for other religions or smething hidden in him. yesterday itslf Christian father was crediting Modi for his release from Taliban, wat does that mean according to ur analysis? lol, u want to present Quran or some other religious text to others to prove secularism? Why congis want to appease few so much? Come out Mani, lot more topics are there to debate upon, ur secularism is just appeasing few and we understand that.

                            Mr Aiyar is spreading discord and hatred among Indians just as the Congress did for the last 67 years.His pathological intolerance of Modi borders on insanity.His ire and frustration at the rejection and humiliation he received from Sonia and the Congress is a festering wound that has no malady or remedy.This unresolved resentment emmnating from Congress rejection against the senior most leadership of Congress is now channelled unreasonably and unfairly at destroying the credibility of an honest and sincere PM of India who's vision is to unite and promote a shared prosperity amongst all Indians.It's very sad that Mani's poisonous rebuke does more to harm Indian solidarity than all the false accusations and incitement he piles up against PM Modi.

                            Aiyer should analyse why dear Rajiv said that the earth shakes when a big tree falls. About the 3000 Sikhs who got killed in the 1984 riots under Rajiv, whose ardent chamcha Aiyer was. About Tytler and other Congress leaders who were held responsible by the Courts for mass murder. Then talk about religious tolerance.<br/>
Modi was exonerated by the Supreme Court. The BJP was elected by the people of India with Modi as PM. Not by stooges like Aiyer.

                            This is just an act of desperation by a man who is not relevant in today's politics and certainly not relevant in his own party. He is clinging on to the last strands of public life left for him by spewing venom against Modi. In every article he uses the same beaten and overused formula of communalism and inter-lacing it with "lessons from history". <br/>
Yay! You've read Discovery of India by Nehru. We get it. While your own party is creeping towards oblivion, you're more concerned with wagging your high and mighty finger at others. This is your desperate attempt at staying in public view. It's a shame you're doing using the name of your worst enemy - PM Modi.<br/>

Be honest Mr. Mani shanker Iyer, and please come out with a white paper on your track record and take (as a so called secularist) on these two riots. Proof pudding is in its eating, not in its label.

                            Poor Mani. He is so educated and talented but is so scared to lead Congress as PM candidate and help India. All his education is only in the media. He was in Congress for so many years but has no courage to at least head congress and be the CM candidate for Tamil Nadu. Modi being a tea vendor has enough courage to be the PM candidate than highly educated MAni. It is a loss for India and a lost opportunity for Mani himself. Lucky for Mani some media give him job of writing stories in their media.

                            In every article he writes ( and he writes only about Modi ) , his hateful feelings seep through his words and know no bound. It is stated in INDIAN PHILOSOPHY that hatred is enemy of self and slowly destroys thinking power. Modi has himself said and world knows that he is  deeply associated with RSS. What special Ayyar is stating here. The concept of secular word as defined by Ayyar and his party has been totally rejected by people of India. Now they want real secularism. The congress and the DEHLI CLUB had enjoyed vast powers and money for last 60 years by creating a fear in the minds of People. those days are over.<br/>
 His articles have almost zero effect on Modi's future. But  Ayyar's future is in doldrum. Why cannot write something on what congress should do revive itself?

You are from a rival party so you can be critical but i am not sure if you even realize that your articles against Modi are not criticism but gives impression of deep jealousy, heart-burn. The kind of venom you keep in your mind is too bad for us to have you in parliament. Sorry to say this but Sir, but you should be ashamed of yourself.

Disagree. I don't think it defines whole of India. What synthesis are you talking about? What did the Hindu faith (or philosophy) absorb from the Muslim saints? My limited reading says nothing substantial.<br/><br/>
Please do not force your brand of secularism on everyone. If this is indeed a free market, then everybody must be free to peddle their brand of secularism. Thank you!

                            Modiji would obviously quote from Gita and other Hindu texts as he is a Hindu. Would a Muslim person quote from the Gita. Have you gone Nuts Mr. Mani. Your Article show the utter frustration of yours and your Italian Clan.

                            Mr Aiyar, excellent piece of writing. I have always enjoyed reading your opinion piece because you articulate intelligently though sometimes I do not share the same view. But then why should I or you, in a democracy everybody has the right to share his or her opinions or be critical concerning our government and the ones governing the people. I am sure many will disagree with my comment but then many who do are blind bakhts or driven by just pure dislike for Mr Aiyar.

                            Modi is the greatest pretender ever to become PM of India. The man has used every bit of partisan acting and manipulation available to him to enscone himself in Delhi. One only has to hear his bombastic statements that are meant to incite and divide people, and the way he interacts in the background with the worst elements of his alliance parties, while claiming he is holier than thou.<br/><br/>
The latest shoddy instance of this man occurred in the Delhi elections. He was the primary face of the BJP and used all sorts of dirty actions and phrases to discredit the AAP party. Then, when BJP lost, he claimed he had nothing to do with the Delhi elections.<br/><br/>
Indians would do well to recognize this man for what he is. The sooner they do this, the better prepared they will be to counter the many harms that this man will bring in his remaining term.

                            Brilliant article! Diverse perspectives indeed and a deeply intelligent article. Mr Modi if he indeed is steering towards the moderate as his ardent supporters opine based on last week's speech, should make every effort to repose faith through actions. India is blessed to have intellectuals like Mr Aiyer. He may not sugar coat, but his views cannot be ignored.

                            We secularists regard the Gita as integral to not just the Hindu Way of Life, but the Indian Way of Life.  We would also applaud Modi presenting a copy of the Holy Quran, printed at the Darul Uloom, to Prime Minister Koirala when he next visits Kathmandu; or of Dara Shikoh's Persian translation of the Upanishads to Nawaz Sharif were Modi to ever meet Sharif again; or even a copy of the Torah printed in Jew Town, Kochi to the Israeli President: --- Mani, this is best you can advise to promote your brand of Pseudo-secularism. Instead of exchanging books why not exchange technology? This will be useful to mankind in general. Congressis like Mani has plundered and ruined India just to please religious fundamentalist vote bank. Shame on ilk of you Mani. Oh, Indian brothers and sisters lets achieve Congress free India in letter and spirit.

People who looted India for 60 years and held it back should be quiet. No matter what, I'll say one thing for Modi: he loves India and Mani loves the Gandhi family.

                            In a democratic country any leader may be criticised . But we should not forget that Modiji has won the election after consistent antipropaganda by his detractors. Further he brought a very positive victory for his party (Bharatiya Janata Party). Mr. Aiyar can wait for another four years and then he is free to win the election and become Prime Minister of our country and solve all the problems.

                            At least he acknowledges Vajpayee as Prime Minister, if not Modi. PM Narendra Modi is THE PRIME MINISTER of India whether Mani likes it or not. He should address the PM as PM and not "Modi" in his articles. I have noticed that the man never addresses PM as PM in his articles. He has a right to disagree with the PM but not disrespect him. Maybe he should put his own virtues to use himself first, before preaching to others.

                            I do not know why and how Mani Iyer is allowed to talk and write so freely in media. PM had alrady declared that he is Hindu Nationalist at very first stage of his Lok Shabha poll.  So what was Man doing then to speak all rubbish about PM now. If Mani says that PM is RSS pracharak so whats bothering Mani and his team. Is Mani not a Sonia pracharak. Why does Mani talk of 2002 now and why not he 1984 sikh riot in Delhi.  Mani is all of a sudden becoming a noble person by speaking of religion in India. Where are all these Muslims and Christians in Dia have come from. Have they come from heaven or Italy. Naturally thet were converts from Hindu which fact no one can deny. Then why Mani is wasting so much of space in NDTV space.

                            India likes anything foreign, whether it is an ideology, or religion or persons.  We live to get appreciated by others, not for us.  West lives for themselves and try to guide others to live for themselves.  India has great cultural history and it can do great things too.  Just do what we need for India.  In that, sense PM Modi can be Hindu, RSS Pracharak, and equally govern India with equal rights to every body.

And why is that you are spreading hatred against other religions when our own  religion has so many castes &amp; so much of caste bias. We have created this situation where we do not respect people in our own religion. Most importantly, you do not love/like people based on their religion/caste and if somebody is doing it do not worry...end of the day once the living status of a person improves (Like in US), these all things become immaterial.
