Headline::::The Seeds of Modi's Future Failure?



DateTime::::2014-12-08T14:00:00+05:30



(Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 14 books, including, most recently, Pax Indica: India and the World of the 21st Century.)I have just sent to the press the manuscript of my 15th book, India Shastra, which will appear in January. India Shastra is a collection of 101 articles and essays, some longish, some rather short, that seek to convey a portrait of contemporary India from the perspective of late 2014.With India Shastra, I have concluded a de facto trilogy of works attempting to explore what makes my country what it is.India: from Midnight to the Millennium (1997), slightly revised and republished at the turn of the century as India: from Midnight to the Millennium and Beyond (2000), took in the broad sweep of India's politics, economics, society and culture in its first 50 years of Independence. The Elephant, the Tiger and the Cellphone (2007) was a collection of various writings on the same themes, bringing the narrative of India's transformation up to the 60th anniversary of India's Independence. India Shastra (2014) updates the story with more recent writings, and takes into account the dramatic change in Indian politics today with the ascent to power of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party.My basic thesis about India has remained consistent in these three books. It is a land of extraordinary pluralism and diversity, where political democracy is indispensable to national survival; a country of great economic potential held back by some of its own policies and practices, many of which are in the process of being re-examined and reinvented; and a lively, contentious and exciting society which is far removed from the timeless and unchanging land of well-worn clich&#233;. A Rip Kumar Winkle who had fallen asleep at the end of the Second World War 70 years ago would be unable to recognize the India of 2015.Everything has either changed dramatically or is in the process of changing: the nation's politics, its economic preferences, its social assumptions, the relations amongst castes, the material and professional choices available in the country, the patterns and habits of daily life, and the intangible attitudes of Indians towards everything from religion to profit-making.I am, I suppose, an old-fashioned liberal, one who believes in political liberty, social freedoms, minimal restrictions on economic activity, and a concern for social justice. This has tended to put me in a very small minority in India, where political opinion is divided between a "left" pledged to upholding socialism and state command of the economy, and a "right" defined principally by its adherence to religious and cultural nationalism, rather than economic or political convictions. The one liberal political party that largely embodied my views, C. Rajagopalachari's Swatantra Party, disappeared in 1974, and it was only after the liberalization policies undertaken by the Congress Party in 1991 that I was able to find a congenial home there, albeit, on some issues, on its fringes. My political isolation in many respects has been compounded by the robustness of my views on foreign policy and national security, laid out in greatest detail in Pax Indica: India and the World of the 21st Century (2012). A liberal hawk is a rare bird anywhere, but particularly in an India whose social and economic pieties and peace-loving credentials were sanctified by the hallowed freedom movement led by Mahatma Gandhi.And yet, as my book suggests, India may be coming increasingly around to the point where my beliefs might one day even appear mainstream. Prime Minister Modi's speeches and sound bytes since his election could certainly have been scripted by a liberal, though the gap between articulation and implementation, in his case, remains currently wide enough to drive a rath through. What can one make of a man who speaks of tolerance and accommodation while condoning hate speech by party members he has appointed as Ministers? How does one interpret a PM who speaks of "minimal government, maximum governance" but is in the process of running the most centralized, top-down, bureaucracy-driven, personality-cult dominated central government since Indira Gandhi's Emergency rule? What conclusion can one reasonably derive about a leader who says "the government has no business to be in business" but has never said a word to question the anomaly of his government owning and running airlines and hotels? How can one interpret the intentions of a Prime Minister elected on a promise of delivering results, whose very fine speeches and liberal pronouncements appear completely disconnected from any tangible action plan, adequate funding or execution capacity?So the jury is still out on how much we can celebrate the "Modi-fication" of India. What are the prospects for the expansion of the liberal space in India over the next two decades? This desirable objective requires both growth and equity. Progress is being made on both, but there's still a lot that needs to be done before we get there.We cannot think of economic growth in India without also thinking of bringing its benefits to all our countrymen and women. (As I have written elsewhere, whether we grow at 9% or at 5%, we have to ensure the benefits reach the bottom 25% of our population.) The most significant facts about the Indian people today are that the majority of them are young, and the majority of them are poor. The availability of human resources of such magnitude only means anything if we can feed, house, clothe, educate and train these young people so they can actually contribute to achieving socio-economic change in their own lives and in the country's fortunes. If we can't do that - if we fail to provide them the opportunities to make something of their lives in the new India - the same youthful and aspirational population could be not only a burden but even a threat, since so much of terrorism and extremist violence in our country is carried out by embittered, under-educated and unemployed young men.As a political representative in India today, I certainly do not take the prospects of success for granted. The process of doing what I have described is not just huge in itself; it also involves something no society, not even China, has yet attempted. And that is to connect millions of citizens in a functioning democracy to their own government: not just to announce entitlements that they are expected to grasp for themselves, but to create delivery mechanisms that ensure that these entitlements are not just theoretical, but real and accessible. Prime Minister Modi seems to understand this, if his speeches are anything to go by. But in India, the right diagnosis does not always result in the right prescription, and even when it does, there is no guarantee that it will cure the condition - implementation of good ideas has long been our national weakness. If Mr Modi can change this familiar narrative, he will have earned his place in history. So far, we in the Opposition have not seen enough to dispel our skepticism, though it is reasonable to argue that six months is far too short a time to draw emphatic conclusions either way.There is a paradox at the heart of Mr Modi's ascent to the Prime Ministership. His speeches and rhetoric appear to recognize, and harness, a vital shift in our national politics from a politics of identity to a politics of performance. Yet he has ridden to power at the helm of a party, the BJP, which is ill-suited to the challenge of delinking India's polity from the incendiary issue of religious identity that it had built its base on. And his rise to office has empowered the khaki-shorts wearing "cultural organization", the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), whose views on every subject - economics, politics, history, culture, morality, gender relations, even matters of appropriate dress or conduct - are totally illiberal. Mr Modi has built his appeal by putting the focus on what the Indian people manifestly need - more development, better governance, wider socio-economic opportunities. But having won an election by attracting voters to these themes, he has given free rein to the most retrograde elements in Indian society, who are busy rewriting textbooks, extolling the virtues of ancient science over modern technology, advocating protectionism and self-reliance against free trade and foreign investment, and asserting that India's identity must be purely Hindu.Mr Modi cannot be oblivious to this fundamental contradiction, but he can only resolve it by jettisoning the very forces that have helped ensure his electoral victory. I am not sure whether such a fundamental contradiction can even be resolved, and in that may lie the seeds of Mr Modi's future failure.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Agree with Tharoor to a point. But it cannot be said that Modi has just said things without any plans or execution. I was just going through a report from Morgan Stanley which says about the decisions which the govt took in last 6 months (which itself is a comprehensive list) and its long term positive impact for the country at large. Just join all the dots of small decisions which the govt has taken in last six months and you will get the bigger picture.

                            Agree with ST if Modi fails India will be in trouble. For the pleasure of CONgress, Modi will lose. But what happens to country? New government is struggling to correct the last 5 years bad governance. Can we afford to lose another 5 years? After 5 years can another opportunistic coalition correct the decades problems? So Mr. Tharoor ask your party to raise above petty politics and co-operate with new government. Do not wish Modi's failure which will be India's failure inevitably.

                            The people who think they done an awesome job by bringing BJP/RSS to power have failed to understand and anticipate what India is going to become after 10 years. Pakistan destroyed themselves by voting some hard core fanatics who does not even understand the religion. In the name of development this party looks to take a total diversion towards spoiling the harmony &amp; peace. Still out of hatred towards communities this comments might not be liked but ..... back of this will be clicked.

                            As if the Congress did everything right!!! If India is in a mess a large portion of the blame will be at the doorstep of the Congress party of which ST is a member. It is best if these Congress 'liberals', (shamsters peddling secularism for minority appeasement with no benefits to the intended communities since independence), stop peddling free and unsolicited advise because the UPA was famous for what it did (mega scams) and what it did not (policy paralysis and dividing communities). That NDTV gives regular space for such columns which really does not reflect alternative viewpoint is a surprise.

                            ST: May be BJP &amp; RSS are illiberal and Congress is not. But your writings seem to suggest Modi is best among all leaders available esp. compared to leaders of Congress. Then why stop short of suggesting that Modi's leadership with Congress party under him will be the best medicine, eh?

                            I can see India(after 10-15 years) dominated by the capitalists, working class in a economically very poor condition. environment degradation where a lot of expenditure will be incurred on health services thanks to make in India free for all, no restrictions or check on hazardous industries.  Further there will be large divisions among society on the basis of religion, caste, lang. Education system will be for the serving interests of industries or satisfying egos of fundamentalists.  I am very sorry but this is the picture

                            Read the Article. After all what is being asked of Mr Modi. The country of such complexities and outstanding issues cannot be subjected to a complete break from the past without a viable and alternate institutions in place. To say that the old relics are still in place has to understood in the avoidance of any ill conceived and untested replacement. The Party which was in power sat still watching the institutions to rot and now want Mr Modi to cast away the rot in a matter of months. Any slip up would be met by 'We told you so". I don't know what paucity of ideas do some people harbour.

Very well researched views.One cant govern the country only through speeches and event management. Last 6 months, except for "old wine in new bottles" nothing of substance.Hyped hope likely to soon give way to all round frustration.

                            Today if someone wants to quit smoking or drinking it takes more then 6 months for him to kick the habit for good. If you want to lose weight, get 6 pack abs or a better physique it takes more then 6 months. When 1 human being takes more then 6 months to change something about himself or in himself then how can the country change in 6 months?! We need to stop living in the 2 minute Maggie noodles world and realise it takes time to build &amp; change things. Even Gujarat did not develop in 6 months. Almost no visible change happened in the first 4-5 years, it was in the second term that the state started running ahead.<br/><br/>
Having said that, may we ask Mr.Tharoor to ask his partymen to stop the lockjam they have created in the parliament so that bills &amp; legislations that will put the country to progress can be passed? Progressing the country &amp; developing it are not only the job of the PM or the government in power. Even opposition has a hand in running the country. That is the beauty of democracy but dynastic parties like congress will never understand that.

Coming to actions, he is in right path and doing his job, 6mnths is not big time to see results.

                            What I understand with the nature of recent events both in and outside the parliament is a mere weak strategy to corner the government. One must understand that till now opposition has shown no signs of helping government to bring India back to growth however definitely showing a continuous sign of weakening the positive sentiments. Of course, what one of the BJP MP said was incorrect but are we so immature to not understand the logic of difference between a callous comment on one side and national development on other. They sure do understand but what to do as we have permanent curtains of greed for power in front of our eyes. In that case, yes, we should definitely increase much uproar and paralyze functioning of one more session of parliament.

                            I heard a few speeches of PM Modi outside India. I don't find any trace of Hindu Nationalism in his speeches. I know, he is a Hindu by family and party background. But he sounds very much like a secular PM outside India. He has already said that the religion of the government is its constitution. The PM of India, Hindu by tradition and secular PM by constitution, is highly relevant in the current context of Nepal. Any thing he speaks or does has enormous indirect impact in Nepal. If he fails, Nepal may follow him.

your last 3 paragraphs are correct and that is where Modi's downfall has already started. Modi himself in his speeches is following a path of Jawaharlal Nehru and it is sad that his people are bent on destroying Nehru's legacy. I wonder why you are reluctant to say this. May be because in your heart you love Modi and are finding that the Modi that you are dreaming is just an illusion.

                            Shashi, it is the so called neo-liberals who are responsible for the current decline of a great country India. You and your party always were worried about the vote bank, had no shame wooing and siding the minorities for votes, were in the same bed with a communal fanatic party like MIM (till they kicked you out), but keep preaching SECULARISM. You have the most useless politicians heading your party who lack common sense, purpose nor intentions to do anything good for the country except to support corrupt colleagues in 2G, 3G scams. Yet, you kept silent on all the damage they did to the nation. RSS has been a great organization for India and Bharat and will be, yet hypocrites like you will keep spreading misinformation, hatred towards RSS. You have no shame in criticizing the other psuedo-seculars, but keep pointing fingers like your other brother Mani (master in intellectual diarrhea). In India MODI &amp; RSS are the most abused names if you hold an survey. The more you try to malign the PM, he will emerge stronger to lead us to a new India under his able leadership.

                            Larger picture which Sashi Tharoor is missing out is the silence of NaMo against, now frequent, communal rants of his colleagues/RSS, also on the effort being made to saffronise Education which makes us believe that is this the smaller dots whe joined gives a bigger picture which is being drawn by NaMo. God knows. One more most important part is there were lot of policies rolled out by the UPA &amp; continued by NDA (Even though there was vehement opposition to the same by BJP before elections) &amp; the challenge which UPA faced was implementation of the same. There is no dearth for ideas. Implementation is a challenge which is also continuing in the present govt structure. The last problem is instead of strengthening the social schemes the current govt is diluting the same and on the other hand trying to cajole the Corporates &amp; Foreign Investors. Look at the

                            Mr. Tharoor has made a fundamental mistake. Though his conclusion is correct but the point on which he has based his argument is wrong. Modi is not a "Hindu Messiah". Mr. Tharoor has utterly failed to understand this. RSS and L. K. Advani deliberately put Modi in focus to get the huge mandate in favor of BJP. RSS and Advani along with their "CHELAS" the VHP and Bajrangdal realized that if they come in front Congress will win. Now let me explain how the conclusion of Mr. Tharoor is correct. Modi is allowing crony-capitalism and he cannot control the entire corrupt BJP alone. Thus corrupt BJP along with RSS, VHP and Bajrangdal will cause "Future Failure" of Modi.

                            few points that I picked from Mr. Ts above comment:<br/><br/>
1.  "I am, I suppose, an old-fashioned liberal". ...... "This has tended to put me in a very small minority in India"<br/><br/>
2. " A liberal hawk is a rare bird anywhere, but particularly in an India"<br/><br/>
3. "And yet, as my book suggests, India may be coming increasingly around to the point where my beliefs might one day even appear mainstream"<br/><br/>
So he builds a nice narrative that today India lacks liberals but tomorrow  (sometime in future) between  the left and the right I will have my own true "Swatantra Party'. High commended by Mr. Shashi Tharoor; hence True Swatantra Party.<br/><br/>
Then he picks interesting approach t find seeds of failures in current PM of India and in words of Mr Shashi Tharoor  "gap between articulation and implementation" , this argument could be extended back decades and would equally apply to almost all of leaders of India congress or otherwise; well actually this could apply to all the leaders of the World. <br/><br/>
Mr. Shashi Tharoor you are refined version of Mr. cleaner (Arvind Kejriwal) he found gaps everywhere to fit his story and you are finding gap in anti-BJP party. At least have courage to stake claim form a party, run a party, and sell your idea of liberalism to India and it's people.  why are you hiding behind Congress and taking pot shots at Indians?

2. Let's wait for PM Modi to complete his tenure to pass any judgement.

                            Mr. Tharoor has written an excellent piece as an analyst and cleverly interspersed it with well articulated political pot shots at the inherent contradictions. Unfortunately for him his own party does subscribe to this mature line of political opposition.<br/>
It would be interesting to listen to Mr. Modi and Mr. Tharror articulating on various issues and the approaches to the challenges facing the country; instead of the shouting slanging matches that goes on between Congress and BJP spokespersons that goes on in the news channels daily in the name of political debate.

                            A goodish piece. The most apt part is the last but one para - "Mr Modi has built his appeal by putting the focus on what the Indian people manifestly need - more development, better governance... But having won an election by attracting voters to these themes, he has given free rein to the most retrograde elements in Indian society, who are busy rewriting textbooks, extolling the virtues of ancient science over modern technology, ..that India's identity must be purely Hindu". The appeal is just the facade for the agenda behind. People saw it in Vajpayee's 5-yr stint also. A schoolboy asks the PM "how" he can become a PM and PM answers 'start preparing for 20XX elections' - can you beat that shallowness from a  country's PM ?

                            Shashi Tharoor is partly right about Modi's rule during the past 6 months, but is in too much of hurry to extend his imagination. Of course, there is no doubt that, some staunch - not fanatical, mind you - supporters are, no doubt, getting restless at the way the government has been handling issues, which have absolutely no relevance to the governance, like the so called Sadhvi's condemnable utterances. Such people only are capable of taking everyone down along with them. Modiji should control them with iron hand. We do not want the government to fail, for Gd's sake, definitely not due to some silly statements.<br/>
Tharoor does not want to comment about Didi's rule in West Bengal, where she is the CM and also the cabinet. Down South, Telengana is another example for single family's rule.

                            Mr Tharoor is right. Modi's government is faced with a grave internal contradiction between politics of performance, development and equity, versus politics of identity. While Mr Modi realizes it is the former that the nation needs and people want, BJP as a party is founded on Hindu identity as defined by the Brahminical and Baniya classes who looks at others - Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Dalits - with suspicion, as if they will defile the pristine purity of India. Unfortunately Mr Modi has to depend on his retrograde party colleagues to stay in power and therefore, will be forever beholden to the reactionary polity of his party.

                            The brand of politics Narendra Modi is doing in India now has made many old timer politicians very insecure because they feel that their shops are going to be closed forever.Think a small school teacher called Mulayam joined the politics and now his family is the royalty in UP.tHEY MAY BE THE RICHEST people of that state. One person who claimed himself as GAWALA (MILK SELLER)CALLED Laloo is one of the richest person of Bihar. Aa dalit daughter called Mayawati could not afford a bicycle before joining politics today she owns bunglows in Luckhnow and Delhi and she and her brother are among the richest people of this country.Like them there are many others in all the parties.Neither Modi nor his family own any property.He gets all the facilities which he requires to remain in politics and to serve this nation.Nothing for his own benefit.He is not giving too much freedom to his ministers for obvious reasons.If he gives them free hand they will also get involved in corruption because everybody is not Modi.Therefore let us support this gentleman because India needs him,the poor needs him,the business needs him.Let us invent BHARAT and its great culture and feel proud of it.

                            Most of the people know that the current govt. has promised too much too soon. The dream sold was well received and hence the majority. however the angst among the people is about the false promises, black money is a big one. However all is not doom and gloom as the article might try to imply. Many emotive issues, like Gita, hindi language, veg - non veg canteens,foregin visits and MSG speeches  etc. have been given more space and lot of chatter. Core issues, like development, fuel excise, jobs, farmers deaths, security, MNREGA policy etc. are not being discussed. It will catch up and if in these policies have too much RSS involvement then we are going to face difficulty. As such organisations don't have  understanding, think tanks, subject experts or any experience in even discussing them. Cultural, religious or lingual flair to such issues just brings in the emotions but not any thought process or research to support such decisions. But all is not lost, however the govt. needs to be kept in check and concerns raised to open a dialogue, which is currently missing. No press conference, no CIC, one cannot run govt. using twitter.

                            India is a liberal secular democracy, not because of Congress, but because of its people. Right now Congress is in minority. However people are still the same. So to conclude that liberals are in minority would be wrong. What HAS gone into minority is certain definition of what constitutes liberal-secular ideology. This should shock no one. Our definition of liberal-secular ideology has always been different from the French or American definition. Please note that American and French secularism are not the same. Mr Tharoor has an intellectual that would put the combined intellect of Congress high-command to shame. I am sure he sees the inherent deficiency of Congress ideology. If he talks about it, it will be a career limiting move for him.

By placing himself in the position of Swatantra Party that he so endearingly remembers, he is clearly giving feelers to the right and creating ground for himself in the new government dispensation. Its now clear as daylight- The guy is switching sides.

                            The biggest problem the country is facing inequitable growth since 2000. As per credit suisse reports published in The Hindu, one can see 3/4th of country's wealth shared by top 10% and it looks even disturbing to see nearly half of it is owned by 1%. In order to bridge the gap, it's NAC under the chairperson of Sonia Gandhi initiated major steps like MNREGA, RTE so as to bring the benefits of growth to more or less completely left out population of around 20-30% of India. Unfortunately louder voices in the name of development either it being business community or media or ruling party particularly Modi's agenda raises fears of further marginalisation of poor into poorer and turn the middle class into neo poor unless and until the growth is aiming for more equitable one.

                            Sashi Tharoor is not a genius to predict the future of Modi or India. After all he is an MP and a former emploee of UN.   He is not justified in criticizing Modi. His history is not very encouraging.

                            Six months of Na Mo's rule needs to be judged from angle of  legacy it has inherited from UPA I &amp; II in specific and Congress in general. In Roman mythology it had taken years to clean Agean's Stable.The Supreme Courts pronouncements related to coal scam and 2G scam are part of this mess in the stable.cancelation of coal blocks allotments by SC has brought the back to square one. It has cost power industry and lending banks (and the nation)dearly.The 2G and other scams are no different in their penalizing costs. Mr. Tharoos, why all this mess left over by your governments at first pace? And you are prejudging the successor who is engrossed in cleaning this mess.Land acquition act enacted by UPA II for public purposes and industry is another bottle neck that needs to be re-amended to kick start the growth. This act is now criticized by Congress ruled states also.This particular act has made land acquisition an impossible task.Indian Railways need funds to modernise and take up big projects. The track record of raising railway resources under your UPA I &amp; II is a nightmare. This is evident from the Dinesh Trivedi Vs Mamata saga; and not to mention Pawan Bansal's  Railgate.

                            No matter what, know one thing, Dynastical congress can not solve India's any of the problem. Yes Modi says lot of things, all of it may not materialize. You were a Minister, your party's Govt has been in power for so many decades, you were clever enough to NOT SET ANY BENCHMARK knowing fully well that you are more interested in winning elections rather than talking about Governance. Just because you didn't set any bench mark doesn't make you better, infact it makes you far worse.

                            Agree. Any country that allows only one mindset to flourish without recognizing the importance of a diverse debate pretty much travels on the path of prejudice. All Islamic countries drove down this path, because the state sanctioned one religion above all else. Europe was mired in Christian beliefs earlier, which is why that era was rightly called "Dark Ages". BJP doesn't want to push India on a similar path, but their actions surely will. The sooner they realize this the better.

                            Dear Tharoor, atleast there seems to be some action and some plan to do something for country..may be its too much of bureaucracies,strict central government control, may be government is running airlines and hotels,but what does common citizen has got to do with it..lets assume that the situation is vice versa, then too how is it going to affect a common man whoes daily struggle involves earning salary to feed his family.From where I see, petrol &amp; diesel prices have fallen down in last six minths, basic necessities are becoming cheaper,police and other government authorities behave sincerely, all local body employees are available on regular time,there is free insurance banking account for all,what more do you expect?why not give him some more time and see what he can do....we have all witnessed what congress has done in all these years &amp; I am sure wildest of mis management and wrong governance can do any further damage to it.

                            Modi could have avoided appointing people like the Sadvi, who have no experience as told by himself(first time MP and rural background). Such type of people only bring embarrassment to his govt. When there is no shortage of good and experience MPs, why he chose to appoint such novice, he only know. But it seems he is under pressure from somewhere. The danger of Modi govt is from within and not from outside. If RSS act like 10 Janpath of the last govt, then "achha din" may not last long. Till now, the govt's performance is quite appreciable, but as stated above he should be allowed to run his govt, which MMS was not allow so. He should not be overwhelm by anybody, again like Manmohan Singh. He is the PM of the country and he should be the final authority, which he maintain till now.

                            Shashi Tharoor is undoubtedly a matter craftsman with words. What however is glaringly visible is his utter discomfort with India becoming de-westernized. His words betray his dislike of a culturally rich traditional Bharat, afraid possibly that the westernized elite class of which he belongs to may lose their importance and glamour. His anxiety that the Modi govt may not act inclusive when it comes to implementation sounds hypocritical,  coming from a Cong man.

He should have utised his brain when he was in power than now.

                            Modi heart is with RSS and mind is with governess. hope he thinks with mind and takes india forward. become a lifelong RSS man it is big challenge to him. he can follow his heart and see India bleed . time for him to take a resolve for development of the country but not at the cost of communal disturbances. History will not remember whether somebody has run a stable govt or unstable but will judge by what the country has got during that period.

                            Well done to Tharoor for using the 'old boy' network in NDTV to plug his writings.  Going by what he has written so far, those Indians who actually buy the drivel he writes will be in for a treat of platitudes, homilies, patronisation and made-up analysis.  The truth is that when the British vacated India in 1947, having divided the country along religious lines, Nehru just took over!  Notwithstanding that fellow parliamentarians had opted for Patel, Gandhi, without anybody's mandate overruled the parliamentarians and 'appointed' Nehru.  With this undemocratic start, India was bound to descend into chaos and far from being administered in a fair and equitable manner was left by Nehru in the hands of directionless, unmotivated and selfish babus who were the remainders of the British Raj.  This babudom has continued apace with the likes of Moron Shankar Aiyer and Tharoor himself availing themselves of the advantages but not giving anything in return.  Nehru was in power for the sake of being in power and, he himself having inherited his position from another chancer, his father Motilal, was never going to allow anything other than a dynasty of his creation to succeed him.  Hence, Indira was foisted upon an already battered India.  Her legacy of leaving India even more battered and exploited is all too obvious even today.  India was fortunate in that one of Indira's sons Sanjay was removed from the equitation.  Sadly, the other son Rajiv acted and did what he pleased as if India were his personal fiefdom.  The most significant threat to date to India has been the legacy left by Rajiv Gandhi in the form of his wife, the semi literate Sonia who until she was nearly 40 decided that Indian citizenship was not good enough for her.  She was the evil power behind the throne occupied by a pliant, weak and totally ineffective babu called Manmohan Singh.  Under Manmohan and with the connivance of Sonia such corrupt characters as Lalu and Raja thrived.  Why, even characters charged with murder such as Soren held sway.  Perhaps the Gods were kind to India in that Sonia's attempt to foist her useless offspring Rahul went awry.  Rahul had his arse kicked by Modi.  If the Gods' kindness continues, babus whether serving or ex such as Moron Aiyer and Tharoor will also have their arses kicked.  The aggressive goons who act as the 'frontmen' for Congress such as Tiwari, Singhvi and Chowdhury (and you don't get more 'manly' than Renuka Chowdhury as evidenced by her aggressive body language which to any sane person would amount to threatening)will be next in line.  Already Tiwari fled the scene rather than face the electorate, Singhvi has perhaps resorted to what he knows best, namely having certain body parts licked by 'wannabe' judges and Chowdhury is in temporary slumber probably plotting her next attack. <br/><br/>
Jai Hind; Sab ka Sath Sub ka Vikas.<br/><br/>
Modi has moved India for ever to a place where the 'dynasty' does not automatically get any sort of mandate from the people and the age of diffidence has gone for ever.
