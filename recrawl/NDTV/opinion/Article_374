Headline::::10 Questions Modi and Obama Should Have Been Asked



DateTime::::2015-01-27T14:57:00+05:30



(Siddharth Varadarajan is a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Public Affairs and Critical Theory, Shiv Nadar University)If you watched the "press conference" Narendra Modi and Barack Obama addressed on Saturday evening, chances are the same thought went through your mind as mine: what a waste of an opportunity!I mean, how often is it that journalists, especially from India, get to put a question to Modi? Since he became Prime Minister last May, Modi has taken scores of selfies with Indian journalists but not fielded a single question on the record. Not one. In August, he spoke to Japanese journalists on issues of bilateral concern. Last September, he gave an interview to Fareed Zakaria on CNN before his visit to the US, but the interaction had a scripted feel in which an English voice-over took the place of Modi's own Hindi replies. So starved has the Indian media been of the chance to interview their Prime Minister that it had to settle on the next best thing: talking to Zakaria about what his experience with Modi was like. The CNN anchor didn't say much but he did reveal that the deal involved very tough negotiations with the Prime Minister's Office, the details of which he was not at liberty to disclose.As for Obama, the White House press corps frequently interacts with him, but till he landed in Delhi this time, Indian journalists, by my count, have only managed to ask him five questions: three on Pakistan including this gem of an exchange, one on job creation, and one, an utter clunker: "What is your vision for India in the next decade? And how vital is this relationship for your administration's worldview?"When Modi went to Washington, the Indian side refused to allow any questions to be put to him so his "press interaction" with Obama was limited to the two leaders making their own statements. This time around, the US side was insistent that questions be allowed. Reluctantly, the Prime Minister's Office agreed, on the condition that there be just one question each from the American and Indian media, to be chosen by the White House and Ministry of External Affairs spokesman respectively.The US reporter asked Obama about the Ukraine and Yemen, and then slipped in a question to Modi about climate change. The Prime Minister gave what I consider to be a high-quality answer, the details of which have been reported elsewhere. But the question put to him by the Indian reporter "selected randomly" about the chemistry between the two leaders was such a dud that it was positively embarrassing. To make matters worse, the reporter congratulated Modi and Obama for having had such an excellent meeting!As I scratched my head in wonderment, I thought, OK, either this presser's been rigged or the selected hacks blew it. Reporters attend a press conference to get news, not to massage the ego of national leaders or let them waffle. So what could they have asked Modi or Obama? Here's my list of ten questions:1. To Modi: Both of you have spoken of a breakthrough in the nuclear deal. Could you tell us what assurances were provided to American companies on the liability front, and whether it's true that your government told the US that Indian victims of a potential nuclear accident will not be able to sue a US supplier for damages even if the accident is its fault?2. To Obama: American law allows nuclear operators to pursue damages from their suppliers in the case of an accident, so why has the US government been resisting this provision in Indian law? And when American nuclear suppliers can be sued in US courts by victims of a nuclear accident -- a California court had admitted a case against General Electric, brought by US sailors for the Fukushima accident - why are you worried about Indian victims suing American suppliers in an Indian court?3. To Modi: In 2008, your party had officially described the Indo-US nuclear deal as a sell-out to America and Ms Sushma Swaraj, who was then Leader of the BJP in the Rajya Sabha, told the media that a BJP government would renegotiate the agreement. Now you are saying this same agreement is the "centerpiece of our transformed relationship" with the US. What has made you change your mind?4. To Obama: You have sanctioned Russia for violating the sovereignty of Ukraine. Why has the US been unwilling to take any punitive measures against Israel for its illegal settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories?5. To Modi: What does the Indian government think about the secession of Crimea from Ukraine and its subsequent absorption into the Russian Federation?6. To Modi and Obama: Do India and the US agree that the forthcoming Paris agreement on climate change should not be legally binding, and not permit a review of emission targets? And does the US believe the new agreement should distribute the burden of emission reductions based on historical emissions, the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities, and equity?7. To Obama: The whole world has seen the Senate report on how the CIA tortured prisoners. Isn't the United States obligated under the Torture Convention ( which it is a party to) and its own domestic laws to prosecute those who committed - and those who ordered -these brutal acts?8. To Modi: You have said you are proud of your association with the RSS, but ever since you became PM, individuals and organizations connected to the RSS, including MPs from your party, have been saying and doing things which make India's Muslim and Christian minorities insecure. Do you endorse those activities? If not, why have you never publicly and directly condemned these individuals and organisation for spreading hate and intolerance?9. To Obama: The US, including your administration, denied Mr. Modi a visa to visit the United States despite the fact that he was an elected Chief Minister of Gujarat, something even the previous government criticised you for. Do you concede you made a mistake? Did you change your mind on the visa issue only because he became PM and you finally realized your boycott would adversely affect bilateral ties?10. To Modi: Your government has passed several ordinances, including one which amends the Land Acquisition Act and farmers are once again apprehensive about their land being taken away to benefit corporate India's projects. If there was indeed some urgency involved, why was a draft not circulated soon after you came to power, so that its provisions could at least have been debated in the Lok Sabha and by the general public?Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the

                            This guy has been very frustrating since Modi became PM.<br/><br/>
Prior it, he was constantly undervalued Mr. Modi and specially raising questions about Modi's English &amp; how would Modi hanle foreign policy, Modi's relation with USA specially due to Visa raw.<br/><br/>
Now Modi became PM and he is proving better than any PM in Foreign Policy matter. Still such frustrated guys are rising questions which have no real answer. All questions are based on hypothetical and practically no fix answer. Instead of seeing what good is happening, they are interested in raising questions only.<br/><br/>
And they forget that Modi is not answerable to journalist, he is answerable to Indian People and Indian Parliament. He communicates with both regularly and he doesn't need to give answer likes you.

As I read the sentence I was expecting the sentence to end with words "the US President". Unfortuntaely (but rightly and that's why unfortunately) it ended with "Modi". Tragically hilarious.

                            Few of them are really gud questions, but few of them can be asked in some other forums (like, Israel one, CIA rorture one, RSS one, Land aquisition etc) and few of them are useless like VISA one. He shld have also asked abt ISIS, BokoHaram and etc, if he is so particular abt Israel, Ukraine etc.

Please keep national interest first and then think about others

                            Good questions. I would particularly like to hear the BJP answer why it opposed the nuclear deal and threatened to renegotiate it and now that it has come to power, it has embraced it? Its a pity if parties vote no on such important national issues merely because they are in the opposition and want to oppose what the ruling party is proposing. If BJP had behaved better as the opposition party, it could have demanded better behavior from the Congress now.

Not likely. Modi likes monologue not dialogue.

Have these professionals forgotten the basic definition of Journalism? Have they lost the art of sensing the pulse of people? Or it is just one more JOB to be a reporter?; if so, please take up something else. Reporting is much more than mere buttering up with those in power.

Where RSS comes in picture in this visit? Come on man …. This is not expected from a learned and mature person like you. Your questions are full of negativeness and biased. <br/>
You must ask some strategic question rather than generic one on RSS …which congress sycophants use to ask every time. <br/>
I am sure you must be preparing yourself for fighting next general election on Congress Symbol. <br/>
Why not any question related to India's bid to secure permanent membership in UN Security Council and how Obama's visit going to help India in this mission. I think this visit is going to help India in big way.<br/>
I like only one question out of 10 which is related to climate change negotiation.

He did give interview to Arnab, the most hostile journalist you could ever see in India. He did put some tough questions. Modi made it a damb squib by clarity and straight forward answers. But same cannot be said abt journalists who are aap supporters, journalists who receive padma awards for criticizing and hounding modi, so those newstraders dont deserve his interview. Modi is not a only one, remember even JJ was furious with karan thaper, bcoz he questioned Jaya for worshiping hindu god? who are journalists to question which god she worship? is tat not encroaching into her freedom of expression?.

First of all Narendra Modi personally do not like to interact with English Media which wanted to see his political,Social and if possible Physical Eemination from 2002 onward Indo-US Nuclear Deal is being taken as the Basis for future negotiations.Why all these People never opened their mouths for the misrule of Congress led UPA Government?All Scams and corruption Charges came in to open by Supreme Court ,CAG,CVC and People like Dr Subramanya Swamy? Why all thes epeople never questioned about theAnticednts of Sonia Rajiv . They have gone deep in to personal lifeof Narendra Modi whichneveraffected any one.Everyaspect of Sona and Rahul have been top secrets till UPA Remained in Power. Why all these people did not question when Conversions were taking plce in to Christianity and Islam. RSS  also has a Right to propagate Hinduism.Why should Narendra Modi condemn them? The Heasrt and Stomach Burning of all these Comrades will be understood by all who follow Current Affairs of India now.

                            All your Questions are good, but What will India gain by posing those questions? Need of the hour is to move forward for economic prosperity of India and not for becoming self-proclaimed Upright Political nation of the World. From world point of view being second populous country does not count much. First of all, India should become economically and militarily strong and then pursue what is right.

                            3 out of 5 questions were on Pakistan..no wonder Modi considers Indian media a compkete waste and pseudo liberals and has totally bypassed them through direct social media outreach...

                            Old issues should not be dug up.Denial of US visa to Modi when he was Chief Minister of Gujarat was based on circumstances existing at that time.Political situation,circumstances go on changing all over and old issues become obsolete..We have to look forward to future,not the past.

                            The Indian Press was relentlessly blaming and targeting Mr Narendra Modi for the 2004 riots no such treatment was meted out to Rajiv Gandhi when much more human life was lost at a national level. There have been riots in UP and Bihar that where large in scale than the Gujarat 2004 riots. I never understood why Mr Narendra Modi has been singled out by the press. I have no religion my religion is love and respect for all humans. I am not surprised the hurt and mistrust he carries. When he see the press he must be getting the feel the only question they will have to ask is about the 2004 Gujarat Riots and nothing more. The press has been biased against him when it came to Mr Narendra Modi and it has been opinionated that is the unfortunate truth.

                            He never had guts to ask questions to MMS, Sonia and her son from last 10 years. Now suddenly he wakes up from the long sleep like a Kumbhakarna and pretends to be the unbiased leader of the fourth pillar of democracy. We know you !!

                            The two issues Ukraine and Israel cannot be equated.US imposed sanctioned against Russia because it violated Sovereignity of Ukraine.Nothing of the sort happened in relation to Israel.US and Israel are allies.How can an ally impose sanction against its partner and that too when nothing material negative has happened.Can US ever impose sanctions against Britain, or for that matter can Britain impose sanctions on any member of Commonwealth.It is the prerogative of imposer of sanctions to find fault with any particular country against whom this extreme action is taken.

                            Retarded Varadarajan..is a sick man, and retarded after Modi's big wins!! All you losers will only loose more...All your questions are answered more than once. A nuclear reactor is set up supplier 20 years back and you hold him responsible for not maintaining it neatly by the governments and authorities? Get some peace dude. Tracking rules if off the shelf ..so India need not share the details on why it has to use and develop reactors. These guys are spreading fear and making wrong noises in the name of nuclear reactors and suppliers without any substance. Anti nationals.
