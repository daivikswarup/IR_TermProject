Headline::::Shashi Tharoor on PM's Invite to Join Clean India Campaign



DateTime::::2014-10-04T18:35:00+05:30



(Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the 
Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, 
the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human 
Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has 
written 14 books, including, most recently, Pax Indica: India and the 
World of the 21st Century.)I landed in Romania on Thursday this week to attend and address the Bucharest Forum, only to be greeted by a flurry of messages. The Prime Minister's office had been trying to reach me while I was airborne. While I was travelling and uncontactable, the PM had gone ahead and announced his invitation to me to join a panel of nine prominent Indians to promote his new Clean India campaign. Some in the media, inevitably, were trying to stir up a controversy: I was the only politician, and worse, the only Congressman, on his list. What did this portend? Was I defecting to the BJP? Would my party be furious if I accepted?I was honoured, of course, by the invitation. Which Indian worthy of the name would not be humbled to be tapped by his Prime Minister for a national cause? At the same time, I was a bit mystified by the fuss. This was not the first time the PM had reached out to me for a non-political purpose: less than a year ago, then-Chief Minister Modi had asked me on Twitter to join him in exhorting young Indians to register to vote. I had already been doing just that in my constituency, and I had no difficulty in adding my voice to his on social media to make an appeal to young voters. I saw the Clean India campaign in much the same light.A clean India would benefit all of us, and I am delighted to support the Prime Minister's initiative. At the same time, as I also said in accepting his invitation, I am not a fan of tokenism, and I was worried the campaign would descend to symbolic photo opportunities for grandees who would never touch a broom again after October 2. Clean India is a great campaign idea, but the real challenge will be to sustain it beyond a week of photo ops. The Prime Minister asked those who joined him at the campaign launch at Rajpath to take a pledge to "remain committed towards cleanliness and devote time for this" and to "neither litter nor let others litter."That pledge will have to be honoured not just for a week, but every day for the rest of our lives.As for the Congress party, it reacted maturely to the announcement, with former minister Rajiv Shukla rightly decrying the silly speculation about "Tharoor inching towards the BJP". "Why should we be surprised about it?" he asked. "There are a lot many things which every government has to do and the Opposition has to cooperate". Shuklaji is right: indeed, as he said, the Congress would have welcomed it if the Prime Minister had invited many other Congress men and women to join his effort. After all, it had been launched on the birthday of the greatest Congressman of us all,Mahatma Gandhi, who once said, "Sanitation is more important than Independence".Mr Modi has been effective in using his Prime Ministerial position - what Americans, in Theodore Roosevelt's phrase, like to call the "bully pulpit" that comes with high office -- to drive change from the top.Like so many others, I myself have written articles about our appalling lack of public hygiene (one of which, long before I entered politics, was made a required text in Kerala high schools by the state's Communist government), but no individual Indian can match the reach of a Prime Ministerial initiative. When a PM picks up a broom, it is news; the country pays attention. By launching his 'Swachh Bharat' campaign on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti -- which over the years has been reduced to a casual holiday in which the last thing on anyone's mind is the Mahatma or his beliefs - the Prime Minister has grabbed the nation's attention. His invitation to nine people who are not part of his government helped portray it as a people's movement rather than a government drive. Who would be churlish enough to refuse an offer to participate in a people's movement, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, thatwould improve the lives of all Indians?Let's also remember that the Swachh Bharat campaign is an attempt by PM Modi to give a new fillip to a national effort of successive governments -- one that has failed to achieve its objectives for years. Congress gave the nation a Rural Sanitation Programme, which in 1999 was changed by the first NDA government to a Total Sanitation Campaign, with equally modest results. The UPA government in 2012 subsumed that into a Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, with the objective of making the nation Open Defecation Free by 2022. Modiji, who acknowledged the work of previous governments, has advanced the UPA's deadline by three years and given the effort a national visibility that sanitation has not enjoyed before. But there is no guarantee that it will succeed any more than its predecessor programmes.The fundamental problem lies in our people's ingrained behaviour patterns - and mindsets are the hardest things to change.The government has announced that it would spend about Rs. 2 lakh crore on building more than 111 million toilets, and invited contributions to a new "Swachch Bharat Kosh" (Clean India Fund) to attract contributions from corporates and well-heeled individuals. The UPA named Swachhata Preraks or sanitation coordinators who were working in the rural districts.The Clean India effort would make swachhatapreraks of us all. The PM's personal involvement, his websites and Twitter feeds, his Walkathon and the reach-out to nine Indians (who are each supposed to reach out to nine more, and so on) are intended to enhance national awareness of the campaign. It reminds me of the mass movement that brought Kerala to full literacy, as volunteers fanned out to remote hamlets, leper colonies and tribal hutments to reach the unreached. That's the kind of sustained effort that will be needed to make Indian clean.As Health Minister Harshvardhan has pointed out, poor sanitation breeds infections and leads to major public health problems; studies have proved a correlation between poor public hygiene and the stunted growth of many poor Indian children, while better sanitation leads to lower infant-mortality rates. A study by scholarsDean Spears and Sneha Lamba proves that children using toilets have better cognitive skills than those who don't. "Our results suggest," they conclude, "that open defecation is an important threat to the human capital of the Indian labour force."But our government has discovered that even when toilets are built, people continue to defecate in the open, most out of sheer habit. An estimated 53 per cent of Indians still do so: one survey across several north Indian states learned that 47% found open defecation "pleasurable, comfortable or convenient". Litter is everywhere because we are used to discarding things in public places - roads, pavements, beaches - and because there are few public garbage bins anywhere. An attempt to install wastebaskets at every street corner in Delhi and Mumbai found they were being stolen; when they were replaced by iron or concrete bins that could not be removed, those became tempting targets for terrorists to drop lethal explosives into, or so the security wallahs claimed. Thus ended our very brief attempt at abolishing littering. As one who habitually carries everything from used chewing-gum to discarded wrappings in his pocket till I can throw them into a bin, I can testify from personal experience how difficult it is to find a public dustbin on the streets of India.We also have a cultural problem: we are a nation full of people who live in immaculate homes where we bathe twice a day, but think nothing of littering public spaces, spitting on walls, dumping garbage in the open and urinating and defecating in public, because those spaces are not "ours." It is this individualistic mindset and lack of civic consciousness that makes our country a land of private cleanliness and public squalor. Educating Indians about public hygiene must start in schools and be drummed into the minds of adults through information campaigns, exhortations and warnings - as well as fines and punishments for willful disobedience. If we can fine people for exceeding the speed limit or not wearing a helmet - on the grounds that such behaviour is a menace to others and a cost to society - we should fine litterers and despoilers of public spaces on the same grounds.It's a long hard road ahead. All over the country, thousands of government employees attended office on Gandhi Jayanti to put in a few hours of manual labour to clean the premises and the surrounds. As one who has long argued that the best way to commemorate the birthday of the man who declared "Work is Worship" is to work rather than take a holiday, I find that gratifying. But the challenge is sustainability. Once the initial enthusiasm has waned, how do we keep it up? And what about the structural problems - where do we get rid of the waste we sweep up? Do we have enough landfills, waste disposal plants, incinerators, recycling plants, compost heaps? Building toilets is not enough - we have to create entire systems, while changing mindsets all the way.Since I was in Bucharest, I asked the Ambassador if the Embassy needed cleaning, but she and her staff had already just done that. When I come back to India, I'll focus on honouring my commitment to the Prime Minister - and the nation -- by identifying a good placein my constituency to start with. Let's see whether by next Gandhi Jayanti we have all succeeded in making a visible difference. Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the

                            You must propose 6 other congressmen to join the campaign. Remaining 3 must be those who opposed you in the last assembly elections. Publish the street that you will be taking up for cleaning so that there is accountability and visibility on the progress.<br/><br/>
My street is Kottaralane, 3rd street, Gourisapattom, Trivandrum. I am an NRI, so i will clean when I am back in India.

                            Appreciate it Mr. Tharoor. Not because you spoke well about Modi, but you spoke the voice of a common Indian. Just hope your party-men learn a bit from you. After all Mr. Rajiv Shukla was not kind enough in his statement when he said Modi should have called call politicians from all parties. We understood Mr. Shukla's intention.

                            The PM's choice for involving 9 prominent citizens of this country, including that of Tharoor couldn't have been any better. The man is pragmatic and polished and he couldn't have articulted his thoughts any better way. Like Tharoor has mentioned, it is very important to change the mindset of the people as far as cleanliness and hygiene is concerned. One can understand an illiterate person dirtying his surroundings, but it is painful to see so called educated people opening the doors of their mercedes or BMW and spitting at trafic signals. Afterall, the onus of making  the Swach Bharat campaign a success is entirely in our hands.

                            Dear Mr Tharoor, While I welcome this well balanced opinion expressed by you, may I also request you to not demean India and Indian culture by saying 'We also have a cultural problem'. It is not a cultural problem but a problem of forgetting our culture. The problem also lies with the population burden that we face and related management issues. Go to an event in a clean city of the world where there is a huge footfall and you will realise that human mentality is the same across the world. Of course that does not mean that I defend littering. The point I am trying to make is the approach and the mindset of those who consider themselves 'representative' of India.

                            Good one Shashi. Admire your attempt to remain neutral and focus on the topic on hand rather than mi politics with it. I feel that you are the only one in the Congress party capable of seeing things in a larger perspective. I am also sorry for the Congress leadership to have been stuck with Rahul Gandhi. Rahul needs to either step up and take responsibilities, or step down and give place for others. Status quo wont help.

Meanwhile, why don't you do your best by cleaning up of your own city. Use ur MP funds, and make your city cleanest in India. You can do it, good luck.

In Bengalore I have not found any one spitting on the road after chewing pan. But in Lucknow like other Indian cities spitting after gutka is rampant. Bangalore municipality has solved its garbage problem with its citizens. Why not same policy will be taken by all the municipalities of other cities. Mind set will be ready after public littering or spitting in public is made a criminal offence and quick action is taken by the police. Concrete Bins may be placed in convenient places for littering and spitting.

                            Clean India programme should be a bipartisan project  and it should not be looked upon as something to score political gains of a ruling party or a PR stunt of the Prime Minister Modijik and in that sense , every Indian must  join this campaign. I  greatly applaud  Shash Tharoor .  Yes,  the core issue is how to surmount the structural problems Mr. Tharoor has elucidated in his column .  Where do we get rid of the trash ? What about the investments in waste disposal plants , incinerators.  Here the private sector can play a big role . The country where I am living , namely , Germany,  the trash is a huge source for generating money for private investors.  Communities and municipal authorities collect money for the service and people are willing to pay for that.  Of  course ,  it is a cultural problem.  Every German on weekends clean not only his house but also the  premises outside their houses and so that  house and surrounding looks tidy . They give value not only a clean house of their own , but also a clean neighbourhood , community where they live, parks they and children go to and the kindergarten and schools they sent their kids.  A good beginning is made in India and hopefully this awareness is sustained and made in to a mass movement until we get rid of the sheep of trash that we see in India everywhere.

                            Why only Tharoor &amp; not others from Congress?  This is because Mr.Tharoor is quite articulate in his praises or criticism.  He never personalize the debates rather generalize it and doesn't give room for arguments or fights during discourses that we keep seeing in various TV News Channels where he would have participated representing Congress.  Not only the BJP even the other political parties too admire him for his gentleman behavior.  His selection from Congress does indeed make sense.

                            IT is not Tokenism but ACTION-- USAID, Gates Foundation to join in Clean India<br/><br/>
New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit that saw him take up the issue of hygiene and toilets for all Indians during his much-applauded talk at New York's Central Park has also led to the US aid agency USAID and the Gates Foundation join in his mission of improving water, sanitation and sewage in municipalities across India.<br/>
The prime minister's five-day visit, (Sep 26-30), also saw him discuss his plan of skill development for Indian youth and the development of smart cities and the two countries have also agreed to work together in these spheres, an official source said.<br/>
India and the US have also agreed to collaborate in the smart cities plan with India's urban development ministry in partnership with US firms to develop three Indian cities -- Allahabad (Uttar Pradesh), Ajmer (Rajasthan) and Vishakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) as Smart Cities.<br/>
USAID, Gates Foundation to join in Clean India<br/><br/><br/>
US aid agency USAID and the Gates Foundation join in his mission of improving water, sanitation and sewage in municipalities across India.<br/><br/>
The US firms are to be the lead partners in the project, the source said.<br/>
The urban development ministry is working out the details of the collaboration for these three cities which will be at the cutting edge of current Smart City technologies.<br/>
The US is also participating in the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Partnership for 500 cities under which water, sanitation, solid waste management and hygiene are topmost in the priorities for the Modi government.<br/>
Modi launched Swachch Bharat on Oct 2, Gandhi Jayanti, as a national campaign for cleanliness, eliminating open defecation and improving sanitation in the country.<br/>
The WASH partnership with USAID and involving business and civil society - such as the Gates Foundation - will serve as a knowledge partner for municipalities and state governments to leverage private capacity for innovation, expertise and technology to upgrade water, sanitation and sewage, the source said.<br/>
This initiative will cover 500 cities under the National Urban Development Mission and will be a step towards achieving the goal of Swachch Bharat.<br/>
The US is also a major contributor towards the prime minister's initiative of skill development. India and US have agreed to collaborate on rapidly accelerating world class skill development in India to prepare young Indians for 21st century employment opportunities.<br/>
As part of this, the US will help bring global standards for skill development in India through nation-wide certification systems and new institutions such as Skills Universities, the source said.<br/>
The Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN, or Knowledge) partnership for higher education will see collaboration between academic institutions in the two countries to help overcome the lack of faculty in India, which will invite and host up to 1,000 American academics from the top 100 universities each year to teach here at their convenience. They would continue to draw their remuneration from the US universities while being paid an honorarium for their work here, the source added.<br/>
India and the US are to also enter into a knowledge partnership for a new Indian Institute of Technology. One of the most visible successes of India-US partnership in the education field has been the setting up of IIT Kanpur, which is among the best technical institutions in the world and was set up with US assistance through a consortium in the 1960s.<br/>
Renewing the links in this area after 50 years, US will now be the knowledge partner for one of the new IITs to be set up in Goa, the source said.<br/>
This would be done through a similar consortium of top US universities so that the curriculum, faculty and facilities at IIT Goa will be at the cutting edge of technology and innovation

                            Shashi Tharoor`s elaborate comments covers a lot of issues, especially the die hard Indian habits of using public places for open defecation, urinating, spitting on walls etc.  He surprised as he was chosen by Modi, for which he seems to be embarrassed. His worry was that Modi would be meeting the same unenthusiastic results as of UPA.  The other fault he found was that why only 9 and why not others to be added.<br/><br/>
This 9 was asked to add their own 9 and so on as a chain.  9x9x9x9x9x9 is going to be more than the population of India.  It is well thought idea of picking 9 prominent people to start with.<br/><br/>

I am very pleased that you accepted PM invitation in nation building. All Indian need soul searching. This remind me a lecture by Shree Rajanish, what he has said that "What ever is within is truth, outside is waste.". This so called religious teaching has created society of selfishness. Most Indian doesn't have sense of civic responsibility. Same Indian who reside in other country adopt concept of cleanness by virtue of default.<br/>
I am glad that you made a very conscious decision leaving your political affiliation.<br/>

                            Shashi Tharoor has stated that a clean India will benefit all of us but he has pointed out that he has an apprehension that this campaign should not be reduced to mere photo opportunities but should continue even after that. Shashi Tharoor has a point....We should not hold brooms in our hands just to be photographed..If we look at our country, a larger part of its urban and rural areas have turned into big dust bins. During British rule,people caught spitting on Mall Road in Simla. In a country like Singapore,spitting is a criminal offence. We have to teach ourselves. If every citizen of India joins this Clean India movement India would literally become a clean country.

                            An impressive article by Dr Sashi. As rightly pointed out by him what needs to change is the mindset of people. Now with PM Modi (Movement of developing India) having set ball in motion, a small push by each one of us in that direction would make it to catch the speed. I am hopeful that in our Mindset, albeit slow, would come and we would see a clean India in the years to come. Let us all join to make this a mass movement and make The resolve of our dynamic PM for Swachch Bharat a grand success. Bharat Mata ki Jai.

                            i agree with mr.tharoor, issue is our own thinking, some yrs back when i was in college rotaract club, we had got sponsorship for dustbin on railway platforms in mumbai, we started with few stations, inspite of warning from railway head, that it will create dirt, we still went ahead. to our horror- railway head words came true in just week time, there was more waste near dustbin rather than in them, people will try to throw from all angles to put was in dustbin, but will miss it and it will fall outside, non will bother to pick up again throw in dustbin. we need to change our attitude , our thinking, and nation will become clean.

                            Good one Shashi Tharoor! This is a people's movement and beyond politics. It's for us, every Indian, and for our children. To think our children and the next generations to come have to live In a dirty India, gives me shudders. Time to do something here! I will do my bit as a citizen . I am very excited with this initiative and don't want this to die due to pessimistic thoughts lot of us have , dirty politics or corruption.

                            I think the reason Shashi brought in tokenism is because how congress works. They talk about everything from Garibi hatao to clean India but nobody knows anything about it. There is no nationally accepted leader in Congress who can galvanize the country ( they may be able to win elections by secular/communal, caste divide).<br/><br/>

Not only do you disrespect Gandhi by taking part in this megalomaniac's campaign but you spit in the face of all those who have fought for independence, fought for basic rights such as adequate compensation, rest and freedom. You should quit politics and take Modi with you.

Cleanliness must be given such an importance as Mathematics,Science are being given at the schools.If not by 2019 , by 2029 I believe we have a matured society .

If Modi could take his advice in foreign policies and other mass contact programmes it would be very nice. One can not replace intelligence with any thing else. Tharoor is great presence in Indian politics.

                            BJP is full of rotten lots, which may be the reason why Modi desires you to share responsibility to contribute to the nation building. Your outlook and approach can provide boosting to developmental dreams of Modi. Either corrupt or fanatic lot in BJP can hardly contribute anything towards development of India.

                            Mr Tharoor,  you mentioned drilling the concepts into the minds of Indians from early stage i.e. in schools, but it's kind of lost in your lengthy article.  It will take generations for Indians to come out of the mindset of self space vs public space and the concept of hygiene. But, introducing must-have subjects like environmental science, in school curriculum, would speed-up the process manyfold.

Your articles on the BJP having mellowed down definitely has sent that signal. And as we all know rumour becomes thick when it is spread!! Good luck and keep your fingers crossed - pun intended.

                            Of course, Mr.Tharoor has started his campaigning for the next national elections. He's going to make a serious push to be their prime ministerial candidate. He sees the void in the leadership, and the Sonia family can't legitimately pose a serious threat to anyone on intellectual grounds or on grounds of political prowess. Tharoor is sensing this opportunity and endearing himself to the educated youth through these articles. I see no issues with that...I think he is one of the handful of few decent leaders in Congress. A worthy opposition is a vital element of a functioning democracy

                            Ideas are good. It needs to be seen how the Government is going to implement it. Not sure if Modi is having the real intention, or whether this is just 'Politics'. Saying so due to reasons such us 'the mygov.nic.in website is just being an eyewash, with Modi trying to create an illusion as if people is participating in governance. People are just wasting their time out there and no one seem to notice the suggestions posted','In PMs address to NRI in US, he brought up cleaning Ganga and kept talking about the sacredness of it to Hindus - Shows his narrow mindedness'. Modi is talented. If only he doesn't confine himself to Hindi and Hinduthva, India would have the greatest PM.
