Headline::::AAP's Tumultuous First 30 Days in Office



DateTime::::2015-03-16T03:56:00+05:30




                                
	(Nalin S Kohli is spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Director of the party's Public Policy Research Centre. He is also a lawyer and has extensive experience in media and education.)
	James Harold Wilson, a former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is famously quoted as saying "a week is a long time in politics". However, for the defenders of the faith within the Aam Aadmi Party, perhaps the tumultuous first thirty days in office might appear an eternity.
	With no shortage of "masala" or drama, the events hold the potential to be viewed as a blockbuster movie in a swanky multiplex. The chief protagonist appears to be a humble and idealistic soul out to change the big bad world. His vehicle for enabling utopian change is a dream organization supposedly based on high moral standards and glorious ideals of perfect internal democracy, collective leadership, ethical standards in candidate profiling and selection, among all else utopian.
	His fellow travellers are also painted with the same brush. All are supposedly united as a melodic choir singing in harmony a hymn of change.
	Thereafter, the "hero" and his worthies first launch their tirade of allegations against all and sundry. In the process they ignore the very foundation of the rule of law. For them, every person outside their fold is guilty till proven innocent, and their word is to be treated as core evidence for accusation, prosecution and sentencing. Given the hype around this high-pitched drama, they occupy great space in an age of 24-hour news channels. Their critics, however, label the movement as one of the media, for the media and by the media.
	Applauded, then damned, events turn for them again. In true Bollywood style, a miraculous victory is achieved and the hero leads his army to a historic sweep, snatching virtually all assembly seats in Delhi. During the campaign, and after the result, there is song and dance. Everyone celebrates.INTERVAL.
	How can a post-interval script not have a twist? Suddenly, the fellow co-travellers display temerity in questioning the hitherto unanimously supported leader about a rather evident lack of adherence to his proclaimed ideals of internal democracy and transparency. But, since the hero can do no wrong, the questioners find themselves being questioned for asking questions. Their motives become eminently suspect. Suggestive leaks seek to paint them as a band out to sink the ship at the altar of personal ambition. In high drama, banishment from the high round table is meted out and the original knights in shining armour find themselves out of favour with the King!
	Now that the King has displayed a tough and hardened stance, he must have a soft heart. A book launch becomes a convenient event to confirm this. The author of the book bears testimony to the abilities of the leader who apparently wept like an inconsolable child and sought self-banishment from authority when questioned by the now-banished paltan. But true to expectations, persuasion prevailed and he "reluctantly" agreed to retain his position.
	That, however, was before victory and power came knocking, this time in good measure through Delhi's voters. With power and office, change becomes possible and the reluctance to hold position metamorphoses 180 degrees into a reluctance to leave position.
	Accusations, insinuations, statements follow both ways. As an explanation, reminiscent of the decades of 1960s and 1970s, some sell conspiracy theories as the scourge behind all these events. A few worthies within the fold propagate these conspiracies rather wholeheartedly to distract focus from their own omissions and commissions.
	And in the grand finale, the cinematic climax (at least so far), the great Indian propagator of sting operations finds himself stung! A clandestinely-recorded audio clip all but robs him of every layer of his meticulously-crafted holy sheen.
	Through all this drama, the AAP has appeared more like a daily political soap opera rather than a political entity focussed on governance and delivery. Political cohesion within a party is built on the foundation of a shared ideological bonding and agenda within its leadership and cadre. Any entity founded on a bed-rock of half-truths, untruths, shifting stands and internal conflict is an entity hastening its slide.
	A people's mandate is an opportunity to serve. Those with lesser values and moral standards consider it as an opportunity to serve themselves. That is the usual lament when it comes to the political standards within the country.
	It is clear that the AAP and its leadership has been preaching values and ideals without adhering to them. If Mr Kejriwal and his team are serious about what they say, they need to ensure that the citizens of Delhi don't get a raw deal for the mandate they have given to the AAP. Every citizen of the city is entitled to expect an improvement in their lives as well as in the facilities to make the capital of India a world-class city.
	However, given what one has witnessed over the past thirty days, one wonders whether Delhi needs to brace itself for a whole new level of blame game and excuses to enable the AAP to wash its hands off implementing an agenda. So far the story has focussed on Fights, Lies and Videotape......Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mr Kohli is well advised to intropsect BJP's performance so far. 'Dream Merchant' has not performed except his usual 'Big Talks' and forein jaunts. Your party is all 'guns blazing' at AAP which is not only honest but started delivering on ground. Rather than starting 'Ban Raj', BJP better keep your election promises.

                            Now Mr Kohli, Shall we talk about the silent removals of Smriti Irani, Hema Malini and other prominent leaders from your party's National Executive. However much the drama was played out in the open provided (very cleverly) entertainment to everyone, one can at least say it was a democratic process of voting which finalised the removal which is more that what one can say for the way the mighty duo runs things.

By the way Mr. Kohli we know how you have sidelined your senior leaders in a dictatorial way with no questioning and disgruntle whatsoever coming from the party cadres or volunteers. Yes, you understand it correctly. What makes AAP different from your sick party are its volunteers and supporters who question their leadership unequivocally when they sense something wrong. And this is something you can only dream in BJP.

Spent so much time in writing this script while his PM says "AK is not worth my time". It is clear that AAP is a major threat to the bread and butter of these traditional politicians. These people go on TV studios and just tell lies in polished english! That's all they do and now they have started writing movie scripts in blog sections.

                            Sir, you can write whatever you think, but despite everything whatever has happened inside the AAP government, their report as a government is more transparent and more visible than your Modi government.<br/><br/>
Within 30 days, they have almost implemneted their 3 major manifesto points like electricity, water, cctvs in government schools, start to induct marshals in dtc buses, issuing show cause notices to private schools for overcharging etc.<br/><br/>
Hope your government in the center also does so.

He didn't have courage to write in detail about "Promises AAP made before poll and it didn't take any action on any of its promises.".<br/>
This used to be a simple line every opposition writes about other party. Fortunately, just within 30 days, AAP is showing action on EVERY POINT of its promises.<br/>
It shows AAP is not in power to enjoy luxury, but to show corruption-free and transparent governance.<br/>
What happens inside party, needs to be resolved. AAP has seen many storms in the past and it always came out stronger.

                            When I was a small kid this behaviour was classically explained with "Jalee, Jalee, katee , katee" basically a case of sour grapes ... the BJP has a full right to complain and go back to this tone and tonality rubbishing the rise of AAP however at the end I am more interested in certain BJP traits: Can and should BJP also display its funding transparently ?? They raised all this hype on the bigus companies but the fact is they found out about the same from the AAP website :) , Can a party convicted of foreign funding really raise allegations on other parties ? Can they tie up with anti national parties (PDP) release terrorists and still be nationalist just by saying 'Sorry', can a party which is under the scanner for duplicate cheque numbers on donations really raise questions? can a party where nobody dares challenge or talk against Modi talk about internal party democracy ? Can a party caught red handed in Bihar trying horse trading ...really talk about ethics .... AAP might or might not be junk Mr. Nalin but maybe its time for you guys to clean up your own act rather than trying to preach to other people ...is all I am saying.

                            It is unfortunate that politics in India continues to remain a dirty game of a few rather than trigger for a national movement to inspire equality, education and plain common sense. A periodic circus of ballot and adult tantrums with potential to achieve nil and lead none.

                            Nalin Kohli, first do an introspection on your own party. The Acche din that you guys promised have only come for corporates. Poor and middle class got babaji ka thullu and increased service tax for voting for BJP.
