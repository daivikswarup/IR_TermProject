Headline::::A Picture Changed The World In IST (Internet Standard Time)



DateTime::::2015-09-08T13:42:00+05:30




                                Attention is the start of empathy. You really have to look at the world. Physical details matter, context matters. The meaning you make from those things is only as sound as your observation of them.
When photojournalist Nilufer Demir photographed a dead baby on a beach in Turkey, she could not have known that the images would rocket around the world and significantly impact global attitudes, both public and official, towards the Syrian refugee crisis. In one image, a tall Turkish official stands near the small body, making it look smaller still. In another, the officer is carrying him away in his arms. He was later quoted as saying that that body, light as a feather, was the heaviest burden he'd ever carried.

But perhaps the most arresting image is a close-up of the baby, photographed from behind and low down. It captures the sweetness of babyhood-his rounded head, his plump little bottom, his tiny shoes. He could be any baby napping, except that he's lying in the surf.
That image of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi became the defining image of the Syrian refugee crisis in Internet Standard Time, which is to say, no time at all. It forced people to confront a statistical abstraction at a personal, emotional level. What does it mean to be a refugee, fleeing war and oppression for a precarious future? It means risking everything. It means heart-breaking, desperately unjust vulnerability. It means that dead babies wash up with the tide. Suddenly, the whole world empathized with a conflict that had long ago fallen off the front pages.
But, also in no time at all, those images were subjected to a kind of maudlin fakery that is somehow worse than frankly not giving a toss. They were manipulated in any number of ways. One illustrator represented an image in cartoon or graphic form; someone added angel wings to the boy's back and a rose to his hand; someone had a bunch of cartoon squids and whales sticking out of the waves, weeping over his body. Someone placed his body in the same attitude but sleeping safe in a bed.
These memes come, no doubt, from a good place. But it's a place of empty platitudes. They try to make palatable what is not palatable. They sanitize the scene, appealing to sentimentality rather than speechless pain, skipping the horror and going straight to "a better place". They vandalize the original image by not paying attention. Because that child was not holding black balloons, he was not flying up to heaven; he was face down in the surf, nostrils filled with wet sand, his body already decomposing.
Is that offensive? Yes. It should offend us that a child is dead. But we can only be truly offended if we are very clear on what it means to be dead, and we can only be very clear if we look at the reality with attention.
The world endlessly debates the ethics of shocking visuals. Those debates at least partly elide the fact that we would rather not be forced out of our comfort zones, would rather not be invited to examine our responsibility. I cannot see how shielding a viewer from disturbing truths is more important than drawing attention to those truths so that the world might be moved to act on them.
Aylan Kurdi's image in death was widely published and broadcast as media companies correctly determined that doing so served the larger good, and it did. The images galvanized global attention around the Syrian refugee crisis that has thus far largely been missing, and spurred many private citizens as well as governments to action. They might increase the world's investment in resolving the horror that is Syria. Germans have cheered and applauded Syrians in welcome; the UK has been shamed, including by its own citizens, into reconsidering how many refugees it can take; Hungary has gotten bad press for its hardline anti-refugee attitude.
And the images come out of the fact that Syrians can no longer wait to be noticed. They have stormed the barricades of the world's complacency, metaphorically and literally - as refugees and sufferers of conflict everywhere are trying to. The tragedy on the beach in Turkey is only one of innumerable tragedies that have taken place in that attempt.
And that's the other half of the arc of attention that these images command. The death of a child always seems particularly heartbreaking. But Aylan Kurdi wasn't just a baby: he was a Syrian person, one of millions of Syrian people, who bear the cost of a war not of their making, either by staying or by fleeing. All of those people are going through hell. The empathy we feel for Aylan Kurdi should extend to all of them: they are all innocents.
Images of tragedy and violence should offend only our sense of natural justice. We live in a country where words like "ass" and "bastard" are muted in television sitcoms to protect our sensibilities, while we walk blithely by hordes of destitute people suffering and dying on our own streets. There's something terribly wrong with what we choose to look at and what we find offensive. Our greatest failing is our inability to pay attention to reality.(Mitali Saran is a freelance writer and columnist based in New Delhi.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Thank you Mitali, appreciate your kind write up a lot. The little boy Aylan could be anybody's own son, when I first saw that image I felt the same, I have shared that image on my fb as well.<br/><br/>
As far as refugees are concerned, India as a great nation have taken lakhs of refugees from Bangladesh and we have done our part as neighbors offering a full human touch to the people of Bangladesh.

                            Thanks Mitali for giving voice to what I felt when I saw the image for the first time. I had put it on my FB post, with similar thoughts (and therefore similar reactions), but a lot remained unsaid due to my limited facility with English, which got expressed here. I am a regular reader of your columns in Business Standard and I like them as much for their use of English as for their honesty.

                            A quote from a book by the next generation of a refugee in 1947:-<br/><br/>
"Sight of a woman in rags, and rheum in her weepy eyes triggered in his mind the partition pistol. He recalled his mother's words and got the flash that he, at that time, stood at the de facto `Gateway of India' for his family. At platform no. 1; under the huge over bridge, where on a thick sticky red carpet they were welcomed by the history, and where in September 1947, his aunts, uncles, mother, father and grandmother mourning her husband's day-old murder, and kids and dogs, scratched through the daily meals that came through the ushers of charity in the plates shining with feeble, trembling rays of a nervous sun of freedom. He looked around himself and thought, `they must have breathed here, in this space under the first flight of the steps.' <br/>
Now, in 1969, the space sheltered two wheelbarrows, a few broomsticks, some odds and ends including the trembling woman with rheum in her eyes- an ambassadress of 1947 to the time that changed for others. He imagined his uncles, aunts, grandmother -all younger by twenty-two years, huddled up there. A tangible horror of misery and wretchedness seized his mind. He felt helpless and poor. One of them. Poorest of the poor. Without spare clothes; sans food, sans dignity, sans a sensible meaning of life. A subject of charity.  The refugee.  Member of a race, the refugee, that comes back every time the history wails on the excesses of her brutal man. The race that pays the price of every intrusion or independence at every counter of life... mostly across several generations."

                            Mitali, this was such poignant and profound presentation of the unforgettable image and tragedy.<br/>
You said volumes about the whole grim situation, in the first paragraph of the article. No wonder you are a good journalistic writer.<br/>
Kudos

                            everybody is trying to portrait it as Refugee Crisis and blaming European countries for not allowing illegal immigrants. The media or social activists are nor uttering any word against the ISIS which is causing such exodus. Are they concerned about the persons who do not have money to pay for agents who help them getting illegal entry in other countries and, therefore, are compelled to live in hell-like situation in Syria and other countries ruined by ISIS?

                            Completely agree with the author's viewpoint. We are aghast at the treatment meted out to the Nepali maids of a Saudi diplomat, but nobody then tries to find out if there are any other "Nepali maids" in any other diplomatic household across India..... If this Nepali maid's issue is sorted out, then voila, all Nepali maids' problems are taken care of !!
