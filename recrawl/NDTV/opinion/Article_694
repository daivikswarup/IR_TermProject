Headline::::An Open Letter to Hema Malini



DateTime::::2015-07-09T15:31:00+05:30




                                Dear Hema Malini,
 
What happened last week was the stuff of nightmares. To be involved in a major collision on an Indian highway is scary and dangerous for everyone involved, no matter how big or small their car. But what you are going through right now is a cakewalk compared to the anguish of Chinni's parents. And at a time like this to be releasing insensitive tweets blaming a grieving father is not just callous but downright inexcusable. 
 
We can debate for years whose fault it was. Was your Mercedes driving too fast? Did the Alto ease into the highway with proper caution? At this moment, these questions seem immaterial. Because regardless of which driver is to blame, I can say with certainty that it was definitely not Chinni's fault. Her life was senselessly lost, forever extinguished and she will never return to her parents. There will always be an empty seat at the family dinner table even when Chinni's favorite food is cooked and there will always be an empty bed even as her mother sits down to recite her favorite bedtime story. And no amount of monetary compensation will ever fill the void in her parents' hearts. As a mother with daughters of your own, it is unthinkable that you are choosing this moment of grief in what seems to be an attempt to free your conscience (and manage your public image) by blaming a father who has lost his youngest child. 
 
I am willing to concede that you were also an injured party. You suffered a gash to your forehead and if the media pictures are anything to go by, you were bleeding profusely and were probably in a great degree of pain. It's also clear that you were not driving your car and your car too was hit badly. It was a terrible accident for both parties. I get it. Movie star or not, in that moment of vulnerability, you too were dependent on the kindness of someone to rush you to a medical facility. But was it so unthinkable to put that little girl in the car with you? What kept you from doing that? Was it the fear that you would be blamed if something happened to her on the way to the hospital?
 
As a Lok Sabha MP, I wish you would look at the larger picture in this situation. India has several hundred national highways that form the economic backbone of the country. These roads cover almost 96,000 km across India and there are several other ambitious roadways in the works. Along these major roads, there are thousands of accidents that happen involving countless Chinnis. Instead of senselessly ascribing blame to a grieving parent, wouldn't your star power be better used to mobilize lawmakers? As we add more roads, we need to add equally modern Emergency Medical Services to handle accidents and mishaps. The particular highway that you were on is a major artery between our national capital and the capital of one of our biggest states. It was not an obscure dusty village road and yet the emergency medical service provided was allegedly questionable at best. Wouldn't your time be better spent empowering our district hospitals with both the technology and the talent needed to save lives? 
I was not there at the particular district hospital that Chinni and her family were eventually taken to but I'll go out on a limb to suggest it's likely a sleepy place with rusting beds, out-of-stock medicines and helpless personnel who can't do their job because essential equipment is missing.
You are a potent combination of politician and movie star which gives you access to both lawmakers and media - two forceful influencers.
Please launch a campaign or an initiative to address road safety and emergency service. At least that way, something positive can come out of this terrible tragedy. Because that's what a real Dream Girl would do. 
 
Yours truly,
Neha J Hiranandani

In the guise of compassion and humanity the most critical aspect of road safety is lost. We should identify whose fault it is. In India by defualt the larger or faster vehicale is at fault. Media is interested in printing gory pictures of a film star or sad tale of a child's death but not interested in going to the accident site and figuring out whose fault it was?

                            People of this country including a common man, a politician, a celebrities have no regard for traffic rules.  No one takes driving lessons from qualified instructors about how to drive on a highway. Entering and exiting a highway requires training by a qualified driver. Also the highways that we have in our country are not built scientifically. In developed countries highways are built in such a way a that traffic joining the highway join in such a way that they do not obstruct the free flow of existing high speed traffic. In india we built junctions to join a highway. How is this anyway correct? We see all kinds of videos on social media of accidents happening on highway junctions. Our highways have to de redesigned, people should be taught to drive, respect the rules and have compassion towards other road users. Only then we will be able to avoid such incidents.

                            Very well said Neha. You have understood and conveyed the issues and pain a common citizen of this country goes through in such hearth breaking incidents.<br/><br/>
The mail sub-text to this is you high lighting the absolute absence of conciseness, care and compassion we have in India for each other. What is more alarming and sad is when people of power and influence, people we elect to represent us, show this apathy. Unthinkable, like you said what was poor Chinni's mistake in all this, a beautiful and young life lost - and to think of it, could have been saved by a small gesture of helping her and providing her timely medical help. The value of a common life in India is this, sad......

                            Whether Hema Malini is insensitive or not is debatable and not for us to judge. What the parents are going through is horrible, but how is Hema Malini actually to blame?? The person who is to blame is the father of the child (correctly pointed out by Hema Malini) for endangering the life of his child and the others in the car for not following traffic rules. It is sad that the child died but the responsibility rests on the father and people in India need to understand that cars are dangerous and driving without proper training and not following rules has disastrous consequences. I think the father should be prosecuted for involuntary manslaughter, reckless endangerment and rash driving. Yes, they are suffering but only due to their own stupidity!

                            The real questions the writer of the article needs to ask is why India does not have an emergency response system where paramedics are called to an accident site. It is NOT an accident victim's responsibility to provide aid, especially if she is injured. If the chuld died in her car, there would another level of media hype around that, not to mention legal cases. If there was an ambulance that arrived from the town where the accident happened the child would be alive today. Also, ask why our taxes are misused and why no medical facilities are provided in smaller towns for accident victims?? Why the victims have to go to Jaipur for treatment. Why in the 21st century national highways don't have proper signs. Why road rules are not enforced? Why parents do not use child seats and buckle children in (if they can afford a car why not a child seat)? Why the government does not mandate safer cars that actually pass international crash tests. It is not Hema Malini who killed the child it was our country that did!!

Who wanted her to travel from Mumbai to Mathura..instead enjoy your time in Mumbai and leave us alone with a local leader.

                            Making children sit next to the driver without seatbelt is dangerous. The government should enforce a law to disallow children to sit in the front of a car. <br/><br/>
We love our children so much and keep worrying about little things and completely miss out important things like seatbelts. If its there in a car its for a reason!

                            Neha: why pile on Hema Malini? It isn't her fault and just because a child died does not take away from the fact that her car was on the wrong side and the child was sitting in the front seat! In a accident all involved are shocked and are in pain and Hema Malini is after all a human being! Not her fault that the child died. So stop being irrationally emotional- it was an accident and the luge was lost due to the negligence and carelessness of the child's parents

While it's the saddest thing that the little child lost her life untimely which nobody can change. However, the future can be made safer by not encouraging driving in the wrong side of the carriageway and into the oncoming traffic! That's criminal neglect. Mad mad thing to do. The killer on Indian roads is not a vehicle but our apathy for traffic rules!

You are so much filled with fear, frustration, anger &amp; uncertainty, you can't be a normal person.<br/><br/>
Of course, I expect an MP to behave more intelligently than common man, however, taking on the spot decisions, in crisis, is not everyone's piece of cake, not even all the leaders (political, business or otherwise).

Its a very shrewd attempt. Very dissappointing. Indian culture teaches to be cordial even wid ur enemies in such situations.<br/>

                            I dont understand. When there is a child in a car, the driver should drive carefully. Who is wrong is material now. She also felt the pain of the child's death so she express that if the child father drove carefully this would not have happen. Whats wrong in saying this? And in an accident place the person who is injured would be quite confused and not in the right state of mind with blood dripping her face. You should blame the other people who took her and not blame her.

4 years back i met with an accident from my 2-wheeler and rolled thrice on the road with right hand fractured,no fault of mine.I couldn't think of anything that time as body was badly shaking and I was still young.Somebody took me to hospital.<br/>
Can't you empathize the mind of a 60+ year old female getting a fracture on the face?Will your response be the same if the person had been other than a cine star? Are you aware how much pain a cine star undergoes in life?<br/>

So, can you say for sure that the Alto driver would not have been driving on the wrong side or not flouting norms. How can then you pass such judgement.

                            Excellent point by the author. The accident hurt individual must first  make a panchnama, find out all who are injured , drop them at the best hospital and then let others helping you do the job of taking you to casualty of a hospital . Vow , ever realized that when one is so profusely bleeding and injured one can get even disoriented and not think straight.<br/>

Fingers are pointing towards Hema Malini just because she is an MP, a film star and was riding in a Mercedes...... but you cannot rule out that Chinni's dad had been at fault.....and he is now paying a price for being careless...

                            Very well written. Perhaps, due to the impact of the accident, Hemaji developed 'foot in mouth disease'. At the time of the accident, she was supposed to be sleeping; did she dream? In fact,  she also has failed in her responsibility by not admonishing the driver when he was speeding. To say the least, the grieving fathers deserves an unconditional apology.

                            I have heard terms being used as 'Political Class'and it would be an insult and a disgraceful act if we still continue to do so. Look at the 'political scene' for the last one year, common man especially ( inluding jawan &amp; Kisan) is being treated with utmost contempt, separate laws are being applied/enacted for these shameless politician,chrony capitalists and the 'thugs and looters' of this country. Majority of the politicians are in this nategory and they are bringing disgrace to 'still left honest' ones.<br/>
Ms Hema Malini has lost admirationas as an actress ( there was none for her as the politician). Most disgusting is the effort of BJP spokespersons on the TV channels to defend her actions'  <br/><br/>
Ms Hiranandani, thank you for echoing the feelings of common people.Hope, more people break their silence.

For those who are against she neither blame hema nor chinni's father.its an open letter of general thoughts which is also meant for you and me. It's unfortunate precious angel life was gone. But as a mother hema could have took the girl to the hospital however she might not have been in her right frame of mind out of shock and fear to see if anyone is alive out there.but it was harsh to blame girl's father blaming him at the time of grief.As a politician she can make better changes which can bring great impact in our country.if she is reading this. This is not an accusation or insults. It's the truth.

Probably all of those, who have been advising, criticizing Malini, did not experience SHOCK!!<br/><br/>
I did.<br/><br/>
During such occasions, we will be in a state of shock. Can not think properly. We become mum.<br/><br/>
But then, if Hema Malini is into arguments defending herself and her driver, even after recovering and not feeling sorry about the little girl, that can be criticized, as being an MP she is expected to be reasonable with the loss of kid.

                            Neha, grow up. If your forehead was ripped open in a car collision and your car was flung over 50 metres away from the other car, would you check the other car and it's occupants first, or for that matter, be in a position to even think clearly through the intense pain? Assuming you can actually walk over to the other car and check the condition of every single passenger inside it, would you then flag down a car for them and ensure that they are taken to hospital FIRST? If the answer is yes, you must be immune to pain and fear, OR you must be the last saint left in the world. <br/>
Celebrities are not immune to accidents, and the least you can do anybody, celebrity or otherwise is to spare them from unfair judgements. Either way, despite your emotional take on the situation, people like you do give me hope, going by the more practical suggestions in your letter. The solution does not lie with our MPs alone and must start at the level of each one of us. As somebody rightly said on this forum, bad road laws rarely cause accidents, but callous and foolish drivers do.

Why not make all cars with air bag mandatory, if end user want to make a choice for money or life now here is the lesson to all car owners and new buyers in India. <br/><br/>
Government should make these standards of the all kinds and class of vehicles as mandatory. Another example like Nestle Noodles MSG levels all of sudden it's banned but many years of consuming. Where standard and food Safety Company next to kumbakarna's villa?<br/>
Also look all two wheeler only helmets! What will riders do without legs and hands supersonic drive... after rood hits. No proper gear for body...likewise many are not considered for road safety. How cum insurance company are allowing them to ride without these checks.  <br/>
Please we need to take care once we are out of our house to see back our loved ones.!

We know the latter was drunk, and they say that he was driving but all that aside, lives were lost then and lives were lost now, and for that reason alone, there should be a trial.<br/>
I was surprised when I heard that the chief minister offered condolences to the actor's accident and then as a passing remark mentioned the victim. maybe the victim's parents were forced to not file a case, maybe the merc was too fast - we would never know. And from the looks of it, the MP is in no moods to let the truth prevail - she just passed along the blame and considers the matter shut.

I don't want to defend the actress (I don't watch cinema) but its clear that whoever comes into the highway fromva side road is at fault - he must yield right of way to the highway traffic.<br/>
Also to note: in a land where the speed limits are not notified on the highway, how do you define speeding?

                            Dear Neha, y is every1 blaming Hema Malini? Hema ji was taken to a hospital which was very far from the accident spot and Chinni needed immediate attention at any nearby hospital. How cud she take Chinni to the hospital with her? And during this shock, how wud Hema ji know which family member was seriously injured and which was not? It was a highway and a lot of people were there. And due to their effort, the whole family was taken to a nearby hospital. It is unfortunate that the little girl passed away but Hema ji shud not be blamed for this.<br/><br/>
There should not be gaps in between divider on a highway bcoz it is dangerous. The Alto should have waited for the traffic to clear before taking a u turn from one of those gaps because on a highway it is usual for cars to travel at speed of above 100kmph. The person driving the Alto shud have been very careful bcoz life of the whole family was at stake.<br/><br/>
So Hema ji is not to be blamed. It was an unfortunate event which claimed a life of a little girl.
