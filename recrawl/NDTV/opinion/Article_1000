Headline::::How We In Pakistan See Today's University Attack



DateTime::::2016-01-20T22:25:00+05:30




                                Pakistan finds itself reeling after yet another terror attack on its soil. Heavily armed militants stormed Bacha Khan University this morning in Charsadda, about 50 kilometers from the city of Peshawar, and opened indiscriminate fire on students and staff members where they had gathered for a poetic symposium to commemorate the 28th death anniversary of renowned Pakhtoon leader and proponent of non-violence Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, popularly known as 'Bacha Khan'.
Umar Mansoor, a commander in the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistani (TTP) and the mastermind of the attack on the Army Public School Peshawar in December 2014, first claimed the attack. But the official spokesperson for the Pakistani Taliban disowned it. More than 21 people are reported to have been killed and at least 60 others injured during a two-hour rampage; officials fear the casualties will rise. Four terrorists were shot after the security forces launched a remarkable counter-terror operation in the university's premises in a bid to control the damage.
The investigations into the terror attack are underway, but we must not avert our eyes from the fact that the attack was the result of yet another intelligence failure and a major security lapse, especially when only three days ago, rumors of security threats to educational institutions triggered the closure of schools in the same region.
In many ways, today's attack was reminiscent of the gruesome December 2014 terrorist attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar which left over 140 dead - most of them children. The message behind today's attack is the same. 13 months ago, they targeted a school being run by the Pakistan Army that is actively combating terrorists and eliminating their hideouts in North Waziristan. Today, they attacked a university named after Bacha Khan, the man who laid down the foundations of the politics of the secular Awami National Party that has rendered a number of sacrifices for standing up against the Taliban. The message given by the terrorists is loud and clear: standing up to them has a price, and more often than not, you have to pay that with your blood.
More than the identity of the outfit that has claimed the attack on Bacha Khan University, the people of Pakistan in general and those at the helm of affairs in the country in particular need to counter the mindset of the terrorists and the ideology they preach in the name of Islam. These terrorists are afraid of education. They are afraid of the power of knowledge. The very same mindset and the very same group targeted Malala Yousafzai in October 2012, attacked the Army Public School in December 2014 and stormed a university today, apart from  deadly attacks on polio vaccination teams across the country.
Despite the ongoing operation against the hardcore militants in the tribal areas of Pakistan, the TTP's ability to strike in the settled areas of the country should be a matter of concern for Pakistan's civil and military leadership. The rot is surely deep and Pakistan is passing through extraordinary circumstances which demand extraordinary measures. While it is obvious that it'll take significant amount of time to eliminate terror from Pakistan, the more worrying part is that the state of Pakistan has shown no clear intent or political will to counter the mindset that has been a major hurdle in developing a counter-terrorism narrative in the country.
After the horrific terror attack on Army Public School that jolted Pakistan's civil and military leadership, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced a comprehensive roadmap to counter terrorism in his 20-point agenda known as National Action Plan.
While the plan looked good on paper, the situation on the ground remains disturbingly awful and unchanged. The plan talked about countering hate speeches and extremist material, choking funding for terrorists and terrorist organizations and dismantling communication networks of terrorist organizations. Point 3 of the plan stressed the commitment to ensuring that no armed militias are allowed to function in Pakistan, while points 10 and 11 talked about the registration and regulation of religious seminaries and a ban on the glorification of terrorism and terrorist organizations through print and electronic media.
Ground realities suggest that little has changed since then - so much so that the incumbent government itself has accepted that the progress on National Action Plan has been unsatisfactory.
There is another aspect of the attack and that directly affects the already fragile and vulnerable relations between Pakistan and India. Hardliners in Pakistan are linking today's terrorist attack to a statement given by Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar after the Pathankot terror attack in which he said that "Those who harmed us will feel the pain". Former interior minister of Pakistan Rehman Malik went as far as to blame Indian intelligence agency RAW for this latest attack on Pakistani soil. The two reckless statements mentioned above underscore the need to show restraint and maturity in the face of adversity. The authorities on either side of the border need to realize that they should not play into the hands of the terrorists.
As far as Pakistani authorities are concerned, they need to focus on the security threats to Pakistan posed by militants who not long ago enjoyed state patronage, and show the intent to take on terrorists without making any discrimination.(Ali Salman Alvi is a freelance columnist and a political activist.

                            Every Paki wants Indian side to restrain, Go to any 3rd source and they will tell you, attacks in India are carried out by Paki terrorists, otherway round is not true. Infact, India should be much tougher on Pak than it really is. They can not hide behind non-state actors. State or non-state, if it is from Pak soil then Pa is responsible. Period.

                            Regarding Manohar Parrikar's statement, he did not take any names. Why can't we assume that his statement was only targeted against the perpetrators of the Pathankot attack whoever that might be. Where as Rehman Malik has directly attributed today's attack in Pakistan to RAW without any evidence which is political immaturity. So please don't compare the two.

                            Pakistan had declared the Ahmadis as non- Muslims. The Sunni Muslims have been harassing the Shias now. Its Hindu- Sikh population had been reduced by it from 27 to 4 %.. There is an insurgency movement in Baluchistan. There are mafias of disgruntled populations, smugglers, gun runners and drug traffickers in Pakistan. The ISI and the Army have an iron hand on the civil Power. ISI and many in Armed Forces have clandestine relations with all kinds of trouble makers. The PM of Pakistan can not implement his promise of curbing terrorism. In such a context, putting the blame on India is the best thing to do. It solves all problems for the Army and the ISI. The people will forget their miseries in their hatred to India. The Army's primary role in the Nation will continue unaffected The Policy of the Pak PM is derailed by such a claim. Also the terrorists under the Army's protection will not have any problems from public opinion. Well done.

                            Sow the wind and reap the whirlwind ! Pakistan an ideological failure has sought to intensify the islamic narrative which in essence is a fraudulent enterprise. The roots of pakistan's problems go back to its very inception when its founders' realised the error and instead of seeking to pragmatically rectify the historic mistake with a sincere interaction with men of the calibre of Nehru, they opted for an anti-India (Read anti-Hindu) islamic ideological project which will culminate in the destruction of the wretched country. The spread of the islamic poison goes too deep and wide in pakistani state institutions and society generally for it to survive. The Beduin hand seeking security through a mercenary army does not help.

                            The Pakistani Army set up Military Courts; essentially sham courts to kill whom they perceived as 'militants against Pakistan' and  ordered wholesale killings of people- including paraplegics and boys who were minors. The Army has used terror - whether against its enemies or its own people and it is obvious that they will hit back. Common Pakistanis, unfortunately, will bear the brunt of this foolish policy of the saviours of Pakistan, everytime.

                            Pakistan has become a snake pit of Islamic terrorism. Wherever you go and study the cause of terrorism in one instance or tge other....there is definitely a Ppakistan connection (and then a Saudi connection). So its natural that Pakistan would also get hit. So the Pakisrani Army and ISI should stop playing the good terrorist / bad terrorist. The only good terrorist is a dead terorist. Osama bin Laden killed in Pakistan Army top military Academy city - Good terrorist!!!

                            As the author rightly pointed out the terrorists are afraid of education and afraid of the power of knowledge.It is sad that the pakistani authorities didnt possess a strong political will to wipe out terror. How is it possible for a nation to tolerate cold blooded murder of innocent students? Pakistan government should attempt to control fundamentalism otherwise their future will be terribly bad.

                            Qaid-E-Azam must be rolling in his grave. He asked for a separate state for the Security and well being of the Muslim community.<br/>
In 1971 East Pakistan was formed because the Punjabi's and the Bengali's couldn't get along. What has the country achieved in the past 68 years. Even the nuclear knowledge was stolen from "the Hague". I worked for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and it was a very hot topic then.<br/>
Blaming external forces is out of question, so now even the Muslim's who were supposed to be safe in an Islamic state can see their children being killed right under the parents nose.<br/>
The terrorists trained by the Army and ISI have turned against their own masters.<br/>
People who are educated and have a say should put an end to the killing of innocent children without any rhyme or reason. The children had nothing to do with the "Dirty Politics".

After Peshawar, India kept its flag at half past. And now no condolence or sympathy for Pakistani's this time. In fact we Indians don't care about Pakistani's dying at the hands of their own dogs.<br/>
Second, Keep blaming India, still the fact is we don't care.<br/><br/>
As far as terrorist attacks in In India, we are done blaming Pakistan. If a terrorist attack happens in India, we will blame our political class and security agencies and we are going to hold them accountable. We will look inward and blame our 56 inch chest PM and ask him to flex his muscles and demand he keeps his promise. And if he don't we will elect a new PM next time who will.  <br/><br/>
So, Pakistani people can take their cries for sympathy somewhere else.

                            Of course , the write up so namby-pamby in opinion , would definitely find a place in NDTV , or perhaps any of FOX media publications.  An opportunist is one who mends fact in ways that suits his goals, in this case I cease to figure out one. The writer says nothing new, it is just a same old lullaby that every Pakistani antagonist is singing  be it in india or the west.  <br/>
Since the article is so redundant in nature that I find nothing much to comment on it but just a few thoughts are <br/>
1.	New York times, Washington post , think tanks US congressmen and global political commentators admit what the stats also verify, The operation Zarb-e-Azab has profound difference in the state of terrorism in Pakistan, yet the writer fails to acknowledge it. <br/>
2.	Secondly, terrorism attacks since 9/11, have taken over the globe, US, Europe, Asia, Gulf , the strongest of the intelligence and security setups have scum to the evil designs of terrorism. But the writer poses as if it all the only terrorism that exist is in Pakistan <br/>
3.	Fundamentalism has grown manifolds and is evident in the daily Indian lives. Minorities are not safe in India and the world knows it now. The writer apparently mentions statements , recorded on video, by Ajit Doval in which he literally admits to fund and finance Taliban for cross border terrorism in Pakistan, yet a Pakistani like him fails to address it as cross border effort and finds issues in the national action plan. <br/>
4.	For the record, Pakistan has been fighting terrorism for last 15 years, the days of patronizing are long gone, but of course if the writer won't mention it that we were the harbingers of terrorism in the world , then how will he find space in Indian journals.

                            Dear Ali,<br/><br/>
There voices of moderate Pakistanis who don't support terrorism are not strong enough.Their Military Bosses and agencies who openly support Terrorist activities in Af, Chin and Ind should think twice now. Instead of wasting their time in creating confusion in foreign soil, they should defend their own country and get rid of Terrorist Groups from Pak(both Good and Bad). If you breed Terrorist inside your own soil, obviously you are going to be its biggest victim. Hope your ISI, Military and Rulers will accept this reality.

As Hillary Clinton remarked , you cannot rear snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors ... Pakistan should stop hatred against India simply on communal lines and they should understand India has more muslim population than them ( even though some miscreants still look to Pakistan and think that is their homeland) ......Unless Pakis are genuine and stop telling lies , their fate will be only in the dustbin of History ..

                            it's déjà vu We have seen same opinion expressed after every such beastly act.  Pakistanis will never learn - this will continue for another 3-4 decades. At least in other Islamic countries the intellectuals are not in denial, they either support their conservtism or keep quiet in fear of reprisals.  Only in Pakistan they give India color to everything.  Why does the author have to mention Indian defense minister's statement in this story.  Just because he mentioned the stupid statement by one of their own.
