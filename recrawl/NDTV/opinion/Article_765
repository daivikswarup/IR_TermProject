Headline::::4 Urgent Questions Provoked by the IIT Roorkee Controversy



DateTime::::2015-08-17T17:48:00+05:30




                                There are those who hold, not without reason, that our national obsession with the IITs is counterproductive. Leave them alone to get on with it, they say. We have more urgent matters to worry about in the sphere of education: a gross lack of trained teachers, policy blindness and implementation lameness, inadequately equipped classrooms and labs, exams that proceed by rote or multiple-choice so that large cohorts of students today seem to find it hard to think beyond a simple 'yes' or 'no', uninspired research in our universities and, of course, mota and chhota scams wherever we turn.
Given this endless list of viruses that seem to have attacked our educational systems, the IITs may appear relatively healthy. Yet it would be a mistake to believe that they are somehow immune to what one might call general environmental pollution. If there is a systemic crisis, the IITs, which have been, in the words of William Shakespeare, the "shining morning face" of our universities, are bound to show spots and blemishes. Indeed, one reason why disproportionate attention is paid to them is that they function as a very visible diagnostic. National success stories, the IITs possess symbolic value.
Second, as we know, the IITS have long produced 'export quality Indians', a brand of professionals in demand world-wide (Vinod Khosla to Sundar Pichai, this list is impressive and the contributions of IIT alumni to American society has apparently been acknowledged even by the US House of Representatives). Now that we are supposed to be in a "Make in India" phase, it is logical that the role of the IITs is being reconsidered.
The third reason that the IITs are in focus is that they are premier technology institutes. In an age where Tablets, MOOCs and Apps dominate a world narrative of education, it is not surprising that the IITs are in the news.
Fourth, and most obviously, the IITs, perhaps on account of their afore-mentioned visibility, have become involved in recent tussles around autonomy, freedom of expression and student rights. Let's consider for a moment just this last cluster, of which the latest manifestation is the expelling and subsequent reinstatement of 72 students from IIT Roorkee.Newspaper reports tell us that most of the concerned IIT Roorkee students were from disadvantaged sections. We do not have all the statistics, but there is plenty of anecdotal evidence from the IITs, old and new, to suggest that poorer, rural students are finding it increasingly hard to keep up with others in both classroom and social space. IIT faculty take this issue seriously but opinion is divided.Question: Can we do more to help disadvantaged students, not only in the IITs but across our universities? How?
There seems to have been a sort of paradigm shift in this regard from the time the first IITs  were instituted in the fifties and sixties. Then, the IITs  were visualized, so to speak, as a 'non leaky pipe' where students entered at one end and emerged squeaky clean at the other. Now there seem to be holes in that pipeline with quite a few 'non-performing' students 'dropping out'.Question: Does this leaky pipe now need urgent mending or is it realistic to allow for some spill since there is today a much greater 'flow' of students?  
Some believe that the pipe is sturdy enough; if certain students drop out, tough. They really didn't deserve to be at these hallowed 'institutes of national importance' in the first place.Question: Should the IITs concentrate on what they 'do best' which is to train fine engineers and leave the pesky social problems to other experts to resolve?
Another larger group argues that that students these days often lack the 'basics' of PCM (Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics) and English. Coaching centres get them through the JEE exam, but foundations remain shaky. Indeed, recognizing this, many IITs have introduced year-long 'prep' courses in these areas, but pain and stigma remain attached to these courses. Still others feel that students from the 'reserved' categories lack  confidence and suffer from a lack of 'communication skills' - often mysteriously equated with command over English.Question: Why should we assume that a student in a technical institute who converses animatedly in hostels, playing fields and institute corridors in Hindi, Telugu and so on lacks communicative abilities just because s/he does not follow English well enough?
The four questions posed above concerning social disadvantages in education, communication skills, a possible return to the IITs 'core' role and mending that leaky pipe, are, to my mind, interlinked. It used to be said, in defence of the shoals of IIT-ians leaving for better prospects abroad, that "brain drain is better that a brain in the drain". But in a world dramatically altered by digital modes, this argument needs revision. 
If a national goal before us today is the improvement of the quite dismal educational scenario in India, we might ask how the digerati, in both the new and old IITs, could play a key role in imagining the future of technologically-led education. The IIT engineer remains, for better or for worse, a dream figure in the political unconscious of our nation, and where he goes, others might be emboldened to follow.
What seems needed for starters, then, is a non-snobbish public dialogue that engages key players such as IIT faculty as well as IIT alumni who have succeeded brilliantly as role models (Ashoke Sen, Narayana Murthy, Raghuram Rajan, Sandeep Pandey, Chetan Bhagat, Pranav Mistry), not to mention those who have enlivened our current politics (Arvind Kejrwal, Jairam Ramesh, Jayant Sinha). Coaching-centre honchos must be involved in the debate, given that more than 90% percent of IIT entrants, many with shaky English, attend these coaching classes. Most crucially, we must listen to our newbie students.    
I end with a perhaps impractical scheme to jumpstart such an imagined dialogue but take courage from the late President Kalam who often opined that we have a tendency to over-reify 'realism' at the expense of the idealistic and the innovative.  
Going back to basics, we find across India, as mentioned, a woeful shortage of teachers, maybe up to ten lakh, at the middle and secondary school levels, especially those well-equipped to teach PCM. Cannot students at the IITs - M.Techs as well as B.Techs - be encouraged on a voluntary basis to teach in rural schools and/or the second-tier cities for a semester or two or in the summers? This would both help the country and help them.
My suggestion is not that such work come out of their compulsory NSS hours or be regarded as 'charity'. Rather, it should be part of their training, similar to interning with a company.They could earn additional credits for this or be given incentives like 'green' certificates which would confer on them a clear advantage when they apply for corporate jobs - and CSR would involve giving due weight to this. In other words, IIT students could be valuable 'resource persons' to teach basic PCM and technology skills in our schools in a phase of major educational change. Many complain that the IITs seem too spoilt and entitled. Well, here's one way they could 'pay back'.
Students  own 'communication skills' would loosen up during the process of teaching, since the very knowledge of local languages which appeared such a disadvantage in an English-dominated IIT classroom would, in these contexts, be an asset. Self-confidence would be shored up. Simultaneously, the sense of being a part of a larger society would be inculcated in these elite students. And for the record, the scores of IIT students I have informally spoken to are quite enthusiastic about participating in such an enterprise. 
At a "higher" tier, IIT alumni and faculty could function as "masters of the matrix", providing crucial logistical and financial support, mentorship and guidance to such schemes involving integrative partnerships between school and college students and established achievers. As Professor Kakodkar, former Chairman of the Board of Governors, IIT-Mumbai, put it recently, educational reforms in India today are about balancing ideals of excellence with equity. The IITs across our states today are in a fine position to calibrate and influence that delicate balance.

                            Very intersting article. The idea of engaging students to teach partciularly seems to be great idea which would increasre self worth of kids who are struggling to cope up with new environment and at the same time one could hone communication skills.

                            Rukminiji runs her own agenda to be in the limelight by being sympathetic to the failures/loosers in any test who outnumbers the successfuls who are few in numbers, in any given system.  She is a part of a larger mafia group led by Pronoy Roy &amp; Comapany. people should not get swayed by this lady who is utter failure in whatever her proffession might be. People have to work hard to establish him/herself in whatever he/she does. Mere  getting a certificate from IIT/ any institute,  through a backdoor is against the ethos of any prode citizen and no panacea for success in life.

                            IIT IS LIKE A CASTE SYSTEM.<br/>
THE WAY CASTE SYSTEM RUINED INDIA THE SAME WAY THESE RUIN INDIA SO FAR AND MORE TO COME...<br/>
BUT WE FOLLOWERS OF CASTEM SYSTEM CAN NOT CHALLENGE THIS SYSTEM ALSO.. KEEP PRAISING KEEP FOOLING KEEP UTILIXING MUCH BIGGER CHUNK OF TAX MONEY YOU ARE THE BEST BORN EDUCATION INSTITUTE CASTE...<br/>
HOPE ONE DAY WE GET OUT OF THESE THEORY AND MAKE ALL INSTITUTES SECOND TO NONE BUT I KNOW A CASTE FOLLOWER COUNTRY CAN NOT BE INNOVATIVE.. SO LETS STICK TO IT GOOD LUCK INDIA<br/>
50 YEAR BEFORR WAS IIT 50 YEAR AFTER SAME ... AND REMAIN SAME THIS IS BEAUTY OF THIS CASTE SYSTEM IN EDUCATION

                            Nice article but I'd like to point out that the failure of students also reflects on how are they being taught rather than just their inability to cope up with the current education structure. I think it would be fair enough for the professors in these so called esteemed institutes to reflect on themselves about their mode and methods of teaching. They should also put an extra effort to make sure that the all the students in their course are at par with each other. It's intimidating for students if the professor in her first lecture comes with a list of 13 points why students should drop from the course they are offering. I hope RBN reads this comment. <br/><br/>
The author's suggestion about encouraging students to do a few months of teaching training in rural areas is great. Some of the students at IITs, from my experience, do engage with a lot of organisations working in the field of providing education to underprivileged such as AID, Devlopment Alternatives, Prerna etc. And this add value to their resume while applying for corporate jobs. Making it mandatory for students is a nice idea but I think that here the professors in these so called privileged institutions such as IITs or NITs should lead by example. They are more resourceful and can help in building up the necessary infrastructure and channels of communication with appropriate authorities. They can avail 3-6 months sabbatical to engage themselves in this noble endeavour of teaching kids in rural India. This would also hone up their teaching skills, and would help them address the problem of how to communicate basic ideas and concepts to students who are lacking the knowledge of basic concepts. As mentioned in the article it is the problem even with the students at IITs who are supposed to have certain basic knowledge in PCM.

                            since when 'anecdotal ' accounts be treated to make any assumptions? Its very unfortunate someone who is a teacher would say something like this " We do not have all the statistics, but there is plenty of anecdotal evidence from the IITs, old and new, to suggest that poorer, rural students are finding it increasingly hard to keep up with others in both classroom and social space.?"

                            The fact is that proliferation of IITs for political reasons has diluted their brand value. The writer is a professor at IIT Delhi, so her views are bound to be biased. Many of her proposed schemes are impractical in the Indian context.

                            The mad competition for the IITs and in general all engineering and professional courses means that acing language courses at school levels is taking a back seat. Heck, it might even be in the trunk portion of the vehicle. Every kid aspiring for an engineering, medical or professional STEM course is told to focus more on PCMB and just do enough to pass the language course with a first division. Because of this, language skills languish. And then all professional listen and attend personality improvement lectures where they say that communication skills are important. There is a need to emphasise on improving communication skills at school level and to do that through the school curriculum. But our mistrust of school administration is such that we wouldn't want them to have a larger share in the say of a student's academic qualifications. The only way to improve language skills (which ever it may be: English, Hindi, Telugu, etc.) is to read, write, speak and receive feedback on improving it. Then, wash, rinse, repeat. This can happen at school level alone.<br/><br/>
For those who missed the bus, training at college level is needed. How about asking universities to include language courses as a part of professional courses curricula? And not just one, but at least four, one through each year of the course. That would force students to learn the language and improve upon it. Finally, there is a need to uplift the rest of the universities so that they compete with the IITs and de-romanticize the passion with IITs.

                            Let us face it, Reservation is the root cause. Instead of ending it 10 years after independence it has spread its dangerous tentacles all over, exceeding 50% of seats. If the highest ranked reserved category does not even come near the lowest ranked general merit group at the admission stage, the standard can only come down if all the students are supposed to pass out because it is the politically correct thing to do. The faculty also is afflicted by the same caste system.

                            We are trying to solve the wrong problem.(1) We should focus on improving primary education by having a unified education framework that removes the divide between rural and urban, English Medium and Vernacular, rich and poor and give holistic education that teaches people about the country, culture and imparts a modern outlook. (2) Most of IIT output is not able to contribute to India, because industry did not keep pace in Aeronautics, Defence, Manufacturing ceding ground to other nations and employers unwillingness to pay the price-premium meant students drifted to IT, Finance, etc. Factories also have taken time to modernize and provide better working conditions. In many sectors like steel, people have rested on past glory and now finding trouble to compete with countries like China.

                            I could not understand the flow the article. Did she firstly attribute the case of failure in IITs to lack of soft skills namely spoken English. Secondly the dilution of fundamentals in the quest of seats by relying on coaching classes and lastly helping hand to the disadvantaged section in coping with the rigours of IITs. The solution suggested is at total variance to the diagnosis. The solution can only be reforming this coaching structure in which children of impressionable ages leave homes early and like the sweat shops blind themselves to the structured and unifocal cramming of the course content to the deprivation of anything else. In IITs this strait jacket vanishes resulting in the loss of direction and helplessness.
