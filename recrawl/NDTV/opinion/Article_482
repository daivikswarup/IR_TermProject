Headline::::Kumar Vishwas's Crass Comment Exposes AAP Predicament



DateTime::::2015-03-31T10:44:00+05:30




                                
	(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer. She is working on a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which will be published later this year.)
	In an interview to a news channel over the weekend, Kumar Vishwas, poet-turned-leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, tried to defend the cuss words used by party chief Arvind Kejriwal against rivals - the secretly-recorded audio of his invective was leaked by the anti-Kejriwal camp headed by Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav. "My father calls me an ullu ka pattha (a swear word for fool) on the phone," said Vishwas, indicating the bizarre new normal of AAP that has crystallized around stings, counter-stings, allegations of forgery and cries of the murder of democracy.
	At the airport, while Vishwas's interview played out on TV sets, a bunch of elderly gentlemen shook their heads in disapproval, while others laughed. One said "Yeh bada mazedaar aadmi hai, ekdum public ki zabaan bolta hai" (this man speaks the language of the people); another remarked "Yeh sab politician ek jaise hain, ye Kejriwal bhi sabki tarah nikla" (it turns out all politicians speak the same language, Kejriwal is no different).
	The same conflict swept across AAP volunteers and cadres over the weekend, when nearly 400 members met to decide how to settle the war of Arvind Kejriwal vs Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan. The Gandhi topi-sporting cadre fluctuated between moments of extreme joy and vindication to diffidence and suspicion.
	Neither Arvind Kejriwal and his team nor the rebels have managed to emerge from the crisis unscathed. Both teams have made a mockery of the faith that was reposed in them not just by intellectuals and activists, but also the aam aadmi they claimed to represent. Till the Lok Sabha election last year, when Kejriwal put up a brave front against Narendra Modi in Varanasi, the likes of Prashant Bhushan hailed his decision, lauded him in private conversations, called him a man with foresight.
	Why is it then that Prashant Bhushan misled the cadre, asked a supporter outside Kejriwal's residence. "If he knew that Kejriwal was encouraging corrupt candidates, was being unethical , was it not his responsibility to let the voter of this country, most importantly, us the party workers know?" he screamed in anger, when asked about the ouster of Bhushan and Yadav from the party's national executive.  A supporter of Yogendra Yadav declared, "Why did Kejriwal not sack them before the elections? We were with them because Medha Patkar and Yogendra Yadav were social workers. Kejriwal and gang have turned into lovers of power."
	At the meeting held inside, Kejriwal emerged victorious, staying on as Convenor, or top man of the party, after delivering a  speech that lashed out at his detractors, but also bore the trademark humility which endeared him to the Dilli janta.
	"I am not here to fight against Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan. I accept defeat, you have won. I have come here to end this...This is not Swaraj or inner party democracy," Kejriwal said, ending his speech with a clear ultimatum: "Today you have to choose between me and  them."
	What Kejriwal does not realize is that though he may have won "them or me" for now, he has forged an estrangement with the left liberal voter and cadre, which looked at AAP as an  option to fill the void created by greatly weakened Left and the Congress. In an ugly internal tug of war, Kejriwal has made the AAP look like a caricature of its own self.
	When some intellectuals complained to AAP leaders about the increasing importance of a leader like Kumar Vishwas, who according to them spoke the language of the Indian Right, Kejriwal and team said that the presence of Medha Patkar and Yogendra Yadav in the party should allay that fear. Now, with their exit, the reassurance counts for little. Some have decided to give Kejriwal a little more time, others wonder if the "Modi as PM and Kejriwal as CM" agenda of the AAP leadership was not as far-fetched as it was deemed to be.
	There was also the unpleasant manner in which Admiral L Ramdas was sacked as AAP's Lokpal, or ombudsman. He has been used  as a symbol of the transparency and probity of AAP leaders during the Delhi election that was swept by the party.  
	The repercussions for Kejriwal may take time to take effect. The average Delhi resident seems impressed with his delivering on the promise of cheaper water and power. But even if he is focused on just Delhi and is not thinking national, his vision appears limited - why isn't he thinking beyond just this term?
	It is this revelation that has disillusioned the AAP supporters across the country, who were willing to work for the party to help it fill the anti-BJP, anti-Congress space in other parts of the country. In a conversation with me on Monday, Prashant Bhushan alleged that Kejriwal had managed to win the Delhi elections with the help of the same corrupt candidates he stood against. "Yes, I would have liked the party to lose Delhi if it meant winning at the cost of compromising our principles. And Kejriwal and his coterie have proved to be a gang of opportunists. Cadres are coming to us and asking us what next, and we will chart out a path soon," he said, while allegedly busy with plans to bring together voices of internal dissent from AAP from across the country on the same stage in the next month.
	But will this move work? Will another movement of dissent by the dissenters be a viable alternative to AAP? The future of this movement could well depend on how Kejriwal leads his party in the next few months, and consolidates his image amongst his fans and followers. On the other hand, Bhushan, Yadav and other ideologues will have to realize that politics is a game of maneuvering, timing and smart play if they indeed intend to be in the business. As for the cadre, they have decided to delay a show of their cards till they have more information in this rude show of conflicting ideas and ideals.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            It is a power struggle within the party because they all come into politics to fulfill their aspirations and none of them left their jobs truely to serve the public. had they come into politics to serve the public there wouldn't have any power struggle.

                            It's really a pity on AAP that every work, action of its members is put through microscope.. These guys are into politics and differences are they very nature of politics. Give me one example where a group as big (or relatively big) as AAP has worked over the years without any differences?<br/>
What has happened to Janta party? Have we forgotten Congress split, twice? Or Have we forgotten Advani episode in BJP? <br/><br/>
They are being too open as this is what they stand for. Its not closed door opinion forming or drawing room politics that they adhere to.<br/><br/>
What Kumar Vishwas has said is what a common man would have said and its what a politician would say... Its a natural way of expressing one's state of mind.<br/>
Why do we like to place them as 'role models' when they are not as individuals.  They are here for clean governance.. and let them do it.. Don't just rush into criticizing every action of theirs. Let them me normal human beings.. not superhumans!<br/><br/>
Remember, they are here to govern. Judge them basis that... and not how they handle internal issues. Be Wise.

                            I have been an AAP cadre like many and have gone door to door campaigning for the idea and the new thought but in the last many weeks i am very disappointed with Kejariwal, Prashanth and Yogendar, they are unfit to be my leaders. Kejariwal speech at PAC gave an ultimatum to choose between "ME or THEM" i choose to be out of AAP. This is truly the murder and mockery of the idea and AAP too is like the other parties... just disgusting we gave our time to AAP and this jokers.

                            Some subjective comments by the author:<br/><br/>
1.  "When some intellectuals complained to AAP leaders about the increasing importance of a leader like Kumar Vishwas, who according to them spoke the language of the Indian Right, Kejriwal and team said that the presence of Medha Patkar and Yogendra Yadav in the party should allay that fear" -- Intellect does not imply being a leftist -- Stalin and Mao were also thugs.<br/><br/>
2.  "The average Delhi resident seems impressed with his delivering on the promise of cheaper water and power."  1.  is this correct. Any data to prove this?  2.  There is nothing as a free lunch.  Delhi needs money to meet higher demand for water and electricity....where will that come from.<br/><br/>
3.  "he has forged an estrangement with the left liberal voter and cadre"  Why the obsession of the press with left liberals.  How can a leftist be a liberal?   <br/><br/>
Fact of the matter is that AAP was and continues to be a party of dissidents and journalists.  Good at highlighting what they think is wrong.......weak in developing solutions and creating things.

                            No amount of criticism will help these paid trolls to malign kejriwal any more, pls look at the work he &amp; his party has taken up in delhi, AAP is very weak in promoting itself by showing the kind of wonderful work it has done so far &amp; have taken up some truly  menacingly concrete steps in making the lives of very ordinary &amp; underprivileged citizens of delhi a littel more comfortable. In all this fracas created by some over ambitious jealous leaders of its own party, the good work is not visible &amp; is  not known to people. It is appearing as a small news somewhere on the middle pages.AAP should concentrate of good work &amp; ignorw all criticism ratehr then reacting to each &amp; every comments posted against them in the media, At the end of the day or may be a year, they will be judged by the work that they have done &amp; not by the amount of justifications &amp; clarifications they have given to the media on all allegations made

There is a proverb in Hindi which says "Kath ki Handi Ek Baar hi Chadhti Hai" (A wooden utensil(deception) may be used only once).<br/>
However thanks to our FREE loving and/or disillusioned public, Kejriwal has been able to do it twice in Delhi polls. NO wonder his confidence is on sky high!

                            The Author has pointed out some concerns of AK , but still she has shown some soft corner to AK who has been proved that he is a clear opportunist. I WAS a big fan of AK since he was working for RTI movement. Now he is showing his IIT skills in cunning way of acquiring the power and rule the party by killing the internal democracy of the party.<br/>
Now we are not seeing any difference of AK and Jayalalitha, Mamatha, Maya, Karunanidhi, NTR, Lalu who ruled their party with dictatorship and through the people from the party if any one is not touching their feet. AK and his coterie has to face... except AK remaining coterie members are buffons.. without AK they are nothing..but how long AK can make them happy..<br/><br/>
Even congress and BJP are better in sending out good leaders in an indecent way..like, Sitaram Kesri or Juswant singh etc... they have done it openly and have not preached the values to the country..<br/><br/>
GOOD LUCK TO AK for his cunning attitude.. Hope he will be able to continue in his own way for next 5 years in delhi...

                            The media and BJP supporters are completely up in arms about what's happening within the AAP party. The same people who were totally anti-AAP during the elections. However, if elections were held again today - AAP would win yet again. That's because the people of Delhi basically want to get rid of the corrupt (and not for freebies as the BJP supporters keep insulting the voters with). The day Arvind Kejriwal is proven corrupt will be the day AAP will be destroyed - but until that day they will always be considered better than others by the voters of Delhi - and it's been proven so twice already.

Question is; Why do we need to rescue a thoroughly discredited left-liberal approach to politics and society. Rana Ayyub is a left supporter and it is not possible to expect any objectivity from left-liberals. A visit to WB during the left rule would amply show the atrocities and the cadre goonda raj that people had to endure.Tto see leftists come on media and spout holier than thou platitudes is sheer hypocrisy. TMC regime is following the template of violence laid down by the left front regime in Bengal. NDTV specializes in giving space to leftist for whatever reasons and Rana Ayyub, MSI etc. are regular on their website

                            India's polity has moved somewhat towards center in the sense that AAP was courting trading classes and even refused support from Shahi Imam. Conventional left politics is out of vogue, quotas and subsidies are not a differentiator, except new ones like "Pani Maaf, Bijali Half", which all sections of society want.

                            At a tactical level Yogendra Yadav wanted to take AAP in a different direction, probably more left of the center and people like Ashish Khetan more towards center where even trading classes voted for AAP. Also not sure who was driving AAP towards caste and communal politics away from Anti-corruption. It was not sustainable for AAP to represent all views and all sections. It would have been a different matter if they had left on their own. But the way they were pushed out was not good. May be they were voices of conscience  or simply voices that were independent. Either way AAP loses its character.

                            what is your point? The following are the sticking issues I thought:<br/>
a) AK wanted to focus on Delhi governance first. Once they prove in Delhi, AAP wants to spread the party elsewhere. Note that their experience so far has only been in agitation, event management etc. So the focus on governance is a sensible view. Not sure why YY in all his wisdom has issues with this and worse not willing to accept that spreading thin for the lok sabha elections was a major faux pas which has to be corrected.<br/>
b)AK has selected candidates with a sketchy past, has inculcated the high command culture, has run away from tricky issues, can't tolerate dissent, bypassed internal lokpal - which are all not what AAP stood for. At least not to the people who voted and supported him in the Delhi elections. YY and PB have a valid funamental point on this which AK needs to answer to the people and not just to his sycophant few. He is not answerable just to the NE like any other party but to the entire Aam Aadmi - that's what makes AAP different. If he can't come clean, AAP would be termed just like any other party and for sure will not survive beyond this term - as there are many more parties like them and better entrenched and funded. The key for survival of AAP is to live up to its promise of being different.

                            Well said Rana. AAP party under Kejrival is a bunch of cheap egotists who are crass opportunists and will stoop to any level to grab power. Look at AK cozzying up to Anna, getting max out of Prashant and Yogendra and then using cheap language. AAP is now a party of crooks with a crooked topi

                            Left-liberal voter in India? The left is NOT liberal in India, the communist regimes of West Bengal and Kerala have used violence to the hilt. That is the very antithesis of a liberal.

                            Thanks to people if Delhi for bringing AAP to power. Now the whole of India knows that AAP is another party with ambitions like congress , BJP SP RJD BSP TM CPI. Thanks citizens of Delhi for testing AAP and showing to rest of India that AAP is another party like congress and NJP AND above mentioned parties.

                            "The average Delhi resident seems impressed with his delivering on the promise of cheaper water and power"<br/><br/>
Can the writer elaborate on this comment on how he provided cheap water and electricity. Did AK pay for it through is pocket or did he curb the corruption or renegotiate the price per unit with the electricity companies, he did none of this. All he did is used tax payers money i.e. offered the hard owned money of regular people like you and me as freebies. This cannot continue for ever and has to end at the cost of sacrificing other important areas of development like education, housing, roads, sanitation etc.<br/>
Delhites should realize their folly and kick this fraud out immediately.
