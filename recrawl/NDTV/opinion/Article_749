Headline::::Mumbai Police Makes Khap Panchayats Look Good



DateTime::::2015-08-10T17:31:00+05:30




                                In the face of strong public criticism, Mumbai's Police Chief Rakesh Maria has ordered an inquiry into the shameful raids by cops on hotels and resorts in Madh Island and Aksa, and the subsequent arrest of 40 couples. But does it really require an inquiry to establish that the raids were illegal, unwarranted and an outright assault on the right to privacy?
The prima facie evidence that those arrested were adults in consensual relationships is enough to ensure the immediate punishment of the officers who ordered and led the raid, and to ensure fair compensation to the couples concerned. But this is unlikely to happen. The inquiry being conducted by the police itself will end up justifying the raids on the basis of "local complaints by residents".
The criminality of moral policing by men in uniform in this case is, according to the police, perfectly legal, backed by the  Bombay Police Act, which was adopted in 1951. The couples were arrested under Sec 110 of this Act on grounds of "indecency." This section states "that no person shall willfully and indecently expose his person in any street or public place or within sight of and in such manner as to be seen from, any street or public place, whether from within any house or building or not, or use indecent language or behave indecently or riotously, or in a disorderly manner in a street or place of public resort or in any office, station or station house."
In this case the Section does not apply at all since the couples were in private rooms behind closed doors, which the police forced open. Therefore there was no "indecent" behavior which the police or anyone else were witness to. 
So what was indecent? According to media reports, the police forced young couples to call their parents, or in one instance a young woman had to explain to the police that the person she was with was her fiance; who she was going to marry in a few months. 
 
In other words what was "indecent" to the Mumbai police was that the couples did not have marriage certificates framed on the wall which alone, according to them, makes sex permissible. A sort of AADHAAR card for sex! And therefore they can bully, harass, intimidate, humiliate, threaten and then finally arrest anyone from the privacy of a closed room, it could even be a home. 
 
The problem is that they have the legal authority to do so. The Bombay Police Act does not define "indecency". In Clause 2, it has 17 definitions from what are "cattle" to "eating houses" and "vehicles", but not a word about what constitutes "indecency." Presumably in 1951, it was taken for granted that the police had the required knowledge and therefore the complete authority to decide what is "indecency." 
 
You don't need khap panchayats when you have the Mumbai police armed with Sec 110 of the Bombay Police Act.
The law is an affront to democracy. It should be scrapped without any further delay. This case highlights the urgency of it. The Maharashtra Chief Minister should start taking the required steps.
 
The other important aspect is the right to privacy. Will the Maharashtra Government have the political will to defend an ordinary citizen's right to privacy? The question gains relevance because right now the Central Government has taken a position in a case before the Supreme Court that the right to privacy is not a fundamental right guaranteed by the constitution.
 
The case is based on a bunch of petitions which challenges the collection of biometric information for AADHAAR cards, which the petitioners rightly argue, constitutes an invasion of the right to privacy and is also open to misuse. The Centre's Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi argued on behalf of the Government that the right to privacy is not a fundamental right granted by the Constitution. In response, one of the three judges on the Bench stated in open court "If a man is not safe in his own house, then what remains in Article 21 (right to life and liberty)? Where is the liberty then? If privacy is not there in liberty, then what else can be there? To say that it (right to privacy) is not at all there will not be right. We will not accept it." 
 
A central government which does not believe in the right to privacy, a state government which refuses to publicly condemn moral policing by its own police force thereby supporting such actions, a police force that has the right to interpret "indecency" as it wishes, political forces that periodically incite lynch mobs to act to protect their perverted understanding of "Indian culture" ... all of this makes a deadly cocktail for the abuse of power.
 
The Malwani police raids were not just insulting to the couples involved, they pose a challenge to the very concept of democracy.

                            Before some bhakts (who usually don't even read the article) start talking irrelevant things like Communism/West Bengal etc, let me say it is a very well argued article and the author, irrespective of her party affiliation has been a consistent advocate for women's rights in the last 20 yrs. Forget feku, all of BJP doesn't have a single leader who can be described like that. What happened in Mumbai is utterly shameful and it made India seem less free and democratic than China or Iran.

                            Moral policing by the actual police and the self appointed ones is a featurethat appears whenever a right wing government assumes office. These people want to put society in a cage of unreason/ religion on the pretext that religion is the cure for all evil when the fact is that it is religion itself which is the most evil phenomena. This is all religion.

                            Cheap, intellectually-dishonest headline from Ms. Karat. But what more can one expect from an ideologue. <br/>
Police actions in Madh were surely an overreach - esp filing "public indecency charges". Madh police needs reining in. But its NOTHING compared to Khap Panchayats sanctioning honour killings &amp; ejecting entire families from villages, destroying thier lives in the process.

                            Ms. Karat, please go to Bengal and serve your party. They need some fresh faces. Why are you doing 5 start politics from Delhi? Your presence is necessary in Bengal, by the side of poor, in the street. Writing few columns in NDTV will not revive CPM. Are you scared of taking a leading role in Bengal?

                            I think this act of Mumbai police is highly objectionable .They take law in their hand and behave as a prosecutor ,judge, and all rolled in one.Juditiory's domain is always encroached upon as they punish people physically and mentally.They get away after every crime to the extent they are feared for fake encounter. People don't fear conviction as police rarely prove their aligation in court which is also a example of highhandedness.Police should be keep in control by concerned authority. If  Police keep on doing unlawful activity they wil be declared organised crime gang by judges and will be implicated under MACOCA..So Mumbai police learn the lesson before it is  too late..Set good examples, Don't take law in your hand only after that you expect emulators will be  good citizen.

                            Inane comments from a defunct party apparatchik. How do you compare the Mumbai Police with the Khap Panchayats? Have some basic common sense. The Mumbai Police cannot be accused of moral policing. This is part of their job. To keep an eye on shady characters. Nothing personal. If they did not do it, they would be accused of allowing shady activities to flourish under their watch. Fine, if the couples are consensual. Are you sure that it is not prostitution, which is still an offense? The Khap Panchayats are totally different, and carry a lot of respect in the areas where they function. They have been criticised for passing edicts against illicit lovers, which is a reflection of the moral standards in rural areas. But this comparison is really over the top and quite funny.

                            For those who see unlawful activity as a morale booster and pointing a finger towards offenders as a demoralising act, should introspect themselves. Minister of a party whose Presidents are known for criminal activity and jailed, cannot do better.It is a manufacturing defect of mindset of a person holding important portfolio which prevents him act with responsibility. I blame the superior boss I.e. minister for this excess. How is your morale and your party President's morale who has served the term?
