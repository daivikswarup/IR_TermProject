Headline::::Open Letter to Arvind Kejriwal by Prashant Bhushan



DateTime::::2015-04-03T23:49:00+05:30



(Prashant Bhushan is a famous lawyer-activist whose public interest litigations have helped expose major scams. He is a founding member of the Aam Aadmi Party.)
	Dear Arvind,
	In the National Council meeting held on the March 28, in your Convenor's address, instead of giving a review of the party's situation and the path ahead, you chose to launch an attack on Yogendra Ji, my father and me, making all sorts of false and inflammatory allegations against us. Your speech incited several Delhi MLAs- (who were invited despite not being members of the NC) to scream that we were "gaddars" who should be thrown out, and behave in the manner of hooligans. Such was the ferocity of the mob of these MLAs and others as they rushed towards my father, that he felt that he may not get out of this alive.
	You did not even allow us to respond to your allegations. Immediately after your speech, in the middle of shouting and screaming by MLAs and others, Manish read out a resolution for our removal (without any chair, and without anyone allowing him to do so). He then proceeded to call for vote by show of hands without allowing any discussion, forcing us to walk out of what had clearly become a farce.
	It was farcical for many reasons: Many members of the NC had not been invited or allowed to attend; more than half the people inside the meeting hall were non-members, which included MLAs, district and State convenors of four states, volunteers and bouncers; there was no orderly conduct of the proceedings for many reasons, including the hooliganism displayed by many people there; no independent videography was allowed, the party's Lokpal was not allowed, etc.
	What has happened subsequent to the 28th, however, has taken the farce to a level where it seems as if a Stalinist purge is taking place in the party. The party's internal Lokpal, a person of immense stature and independence, has been removed unconstitutionally, merely because he expressed his wish to attend the National Council meeting and was seen to be fair; other members of the National Executive are being suspended, again unconstitutionally, only because they had attended a press conference held by us after the hooliganism in the National Council meeting.
	Thereafter, you have ordered the release of a carefully-edited version of your speech at the National Council meeting, containing various false charges against us, and carefully editing out the portions showing the hooliganism of the mob. It is in such circumstances that I am having to write this open letter to you.
	In order to respond to your charges, I would need to go back a bit to see where my serious differences started with you.  If you will remember, my differences started after the Lok Sabha elections, when a series of things happened which began to show two serious defects in your character and personality. Firstly, you wanted  to push through your decisions at any cost in the party, despite the majority of the PAC or the National Executive disagreeing with you. This included  decisions that would have undoubtedly been very harmful for the party and against public interest. And secondly, you were  willing to use some very highly unethical and even criminal means to achieve your ends.
	 
	After the Lok Sabha elections, you felt that the party was  finished, and could only be revived if it were  able to form the government again in Delhi. So immediately after the elections, you started talking to the Congress party for taking its support again to  form the government in Delhi. When news of this came out, a large number of important  people in the party including Prithvi Reddy, Mayank Gandhi and Anjali Damania called me up saying this would be disastrous, and if this happens, they would have to quit the party. I was in Shimla at that time, I called you up, and I said that you should not go ahead with this unless there is a proper discussion in the Political Action Committee (PAC).
	 
	I immediately came back and we had a meeting of the PAC at  your residence. And at that meeting, a majority of the members - 5:4 - felt that we should not go ahead with forming the government with Congress' support. I had pointed out that this would seem extremely opportunistic, since there was no logical reason for us to change our publicly stated position. I also added that such a government would not last, as the Congress will withdraw support soon, and thereafter, for us to revive the party would become even more difficult.
	Instead of abiding by the majority decision, you said that while that may be the majority view, as the Convenor of the party, you have the right to take the final decision, and that you would go ahead with seeking Congress' support. At that point, I had a verbal argument with you. I said the party can't be run in this manner, and it has to be run by some democratic means. So it was decided to refer this issue to the National Executive which had many more people. This reference was made by email, and people were expected to vote by next morning. By next morning, again a majority of people opposed this decision in the National Executive and yet, a letter was secretly sent by you to the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi saying that he should not dissolve the Assembly for another week because AAP wants to seek the opinion of the people on whether to form the government again.
	 
	Immediately after the letter came out, Congress said they were not ready to support AAP and that left us with egg on our face with the result that you had to backtrack the next day and apologize. But despite that, the attempt to form the government with Congress' support or with the support of breakaway MLAs from the Congress continued, as is clear from the sting tape of Rajesh Garg which shows you were wanting to form the government with the support of those MLAs whom you had yourself accused of having being bought over by the BJP for Rs. 4 crore each. How could you even think of forming a government with the support of such people! And this went on till as late as November, just before the dissolution of the Assembly. In November, you called Nikhil Dey and asked him to speak to Rahul Gandhi to convince him to get the Congress party to support. But Nikhil told you that he can't talk to Rahul Gandhi on this issue.
	Can you deny any of these facts? All this, showed your willingness to go against majority opinion, break all democratic rules of the party, and seek unethical support of MLAs whom you yourself had accused of being corrupt, all in the pursuit of power at any cost.
	Then came the issue of AVAM or Aam Aadmi Volunteer Action Manch, which was a group of volunteers who wanted their voices heard in the party. Because this was threatening to brew into a rebellion amongst volunteers who felt that they were being used only like slave labour, and because you felt that it was necessary to crush this, it appears that the party got an SMS sent in the name of AVAM, saying that volunteers should join the BJP - the idea was to  suggest  that AVAM had become an agent of the BJP, though the SMS was  fabricated by the party itself in the name of AVAM. And using this, you announced in a Google Hangout that these people had become traitors because of that SMS. And on that basis, Karan Singh, who was the leader of AVAM, was suspended and removed from the party. He appealed to the national disciplinary committee, which I was heading, and he said 'I had been saying that this is not sent by me, please have this investigated'. So I asked you and Dilip Pandey and others to get this investigated, but you steadfastly refused.
	Eventually, Karan Singh had to lodge an FIR, and the police investigated the matter and it was found that a volunteer of the party, not of AVAM, called Deepak Chaudhary, created this identity in the name of AAVAAM and used that to send that SMS. You should know Arvind, that impersonating an organisation or persons in order to defame them, is a serious criminal offence. Unfortunately young volunteers in the party under your tutelage are being taught that use of such means is OK in politics, since any means used to defeat a "Bigger evil" is OK.
	 
	Then came the issue of whether the party should contest Assembly elections in Haryana and Maharashtra. Again the matter was put to the National Executive by email, and the majority - 15 is to 4 - said that that should be left to state units to decide in accordance with our principle of Swaraj. But you did not allow that decision to be implemented. And eventually, it was rendered infructuous, because elections came too close and finally in that National Executive meet in Sangrur it was decided that there's no point, and one should forget about contesting those elections.
	When the Delhi elections were announced and campaigning started, you instructed volunteers to start a campaign 'Modi for PM, Kejriwal for CM'. I said this is totally unprincipled. It means that our party has gone down on its knees before Modi at a time when it was positioning itself as the main opposition to Modi.
	When the process of candidate selection for the Delhi Assembly election of 2015 started, I found there was no transparency. Contrary to earlier practice, we were not posting candidates' names on the website. Even the PAC, which was meant to approve the candidate, was not being sent the bio-data or names of the candidates in advance to enable us to check the records of the candidates. In the second meeting of the PAC to discuss candidate selection, because I had received complaints about two of the candidates who were being proposed in that meeting, I pointed this out. You got very angry saying, "Why do you think we will be selecting crooked people?" I said that is not the point - we need to have some transparency and due diligence. That led to an argument between you and me, and I walked out of that meeting and wrote an email on November 27, that I cannot be a rubber stamp for non-transparent and questionable selection of candidates. That email is now in the public domain.
	After that, in the next list, again there were at least four questionable candidates among the 10 names proposed. Yogendra Yadav and I wrote a letter to the PAC on 10th December, detailing the objections against these four and pointing out that this time, the process of candidate selection was very different from the last time. This time, we were giving tickets to a large number of political entrepreneurs who had joined the party only for opportunism, who had jumped  ship from Congress, BJP or BSP at the last moment,  who had no ideological commitment to our party, had no record of public service, and whose sources of wealth weren't explained.
	Some of them were people against whom our party had itself complained that they were distributing money or liquor or had beaten up our volunteers. One of them (our initial choice from Wazirpur), went back to the BJP within 4 hours of us announcing his candidature. Your initial choice for the Mehrauli seat, Gandas, had to be dropped at the last moment only because his photographs were circulated with him showing off, with a glass of liquor in one hand and a revolver in the other. Yet, while he was dropped, his brother was given the ticket. Eventually, even he had to be changed because our Lokpal, Admiral Ramdas gave a strong report against him.
	Thereafter, AAP stopped having meetings of the PAC or sending names for the approval of the PAC, and started announcing names on their own. When all this happened, I said "Now enough is enough. If this does not stop, and if there is no credible scrutiny of these candidates, I will have to resign from the party and make public the reasons for my resignation." On that, an emergency meeting was called at my residence on January 4, by Yogendra Yadav, Prithvi Reddy etc which had 16-17 people from all over the country, important functionaries of the party. All of them felt that the party's campaign would be ruined if I resigned at that stage.
	 
	In that meeting I said, "Look, all these kinds of compromises are being made, various ethical corners are being cut and now you are selecting these kind of candidates without proper transparency or scrutiny. If you go with these kinds of candidates, then even if you win, the further compromises that you will have to make, will be such that they will completely destroy the USP of the party, which is of being a clean, transparent party, wedded to alternative politics. And instead of winning by using these kinds of candidates, it would be better to lose the elections by going with clean and honourable candidates". That statement is being twisted around to claim that I said that I wanted the party to lose.
	I had said that rather than winning by these kinds of candidates and means, it's better to go with honourable candidates and run the risk of a possible loss. Because winning with these kinds of candidates and means destroys the founding principles of the party in the short run, and will destroy the party itself in the long run.
	If I had wanted the party to lose the elections, I would have resigned and gone public with my reasons at that very time. If Yogendra Yadav wanted the party to lose, he would not have convened that meeting and stopped me from going public. Instead, he worked his heart out for this campaign, defended the party on innumerable occasions on TV. And yet you have the temerity to accuse even him, along with me, of working for the defeat of the party!
	At the end of that meeting, an arrangement was worked out with your express consent, that: We would immediately refer all the complaints against candidates who had been selected to the Lokpal of the party and his decision would be final. And the rest of the issues of institutional reforms about transparency in the party, accountability, swaraj, inner party democracy - those issues will be taken up immediately after the elections. So those complaints against 12 candidates were referred to the Lokpal. In the 4 days that he had to do this exercise, he recommended the  removal of two against whom there was clear evidence, recommended the issuance of warnings against six against whom there was some evidence, and allowed four to continue. Two were thus removed.
	 
	But the other issue of institutional reforms, which was agreed to be taken up within two days of the election results, were not discussed. Instead, the National Executive meeting of February 26, which you chose not to attend, started with Vishwas announcing your resignation and a no holds barred attack on Yogendra Yadav and myself by members of your coterie. The message conveyed by them on your behalf was clear: That the price for your continuing as Convenor was our removal from the PAC and NE. I then responded and pointed out the things I have mentioned above, and the issues of institutional reforms, but those were not discussed. The only issue that was discussed that day was whether you should continue as Convenor.
	We all agreed that you should continue, but thereafter, some people went to your residence to meet you, and you made it clear that it's either you or us, and that we have to be removed. And therefore, that is what happened in the next meeting which was held on March 4.
	A charge that is made against me is that I did not campaign for the party during this election. I had said that I can't campaign for many of these candidates, and given the manner in which these candidates had been selected, I was willing to campaign only for those candidates about whom I was fairly certain that they were the kind of people who would take the ideology of clean politics forward and work in public interest if they win. I had in fact given a list of five people that I thought were decent. But the party did not send me any programme for addressing public meetings. I therefore went for Pankaj Pushkar's public meetings who had personally invited me.
	The other charge made against me is that I stopped people from donating to AAP. When other people asked me whether they should donate etc, I'd said, "Look, you should donate to those candidates who appear to be decent and honest to you". You and your coterie have made the same charge against my sister Shalini Gupta. She also said the same thing that I had said to a closed circle of friends. In fact she strenuously encouraged the Global group to donate to deserving candidates, which is why several candidates got so much funds from NRIs.
	Your coterie have also accused my father, my sister and myself of trying to capture the party. Arvind, you know very well that none of us have even wanted any executive positions or tickets for ourselves or any friends or family members. We have only tried to contribute and help in every way that we could to see the party grow into a powerful and credible vehicle for alternative politics in the country. My father, apart from donating more than 2 crores as seed money to the party, has spent an enormous amount of time in giving selfless advice, legal and otherwise to the party. He played a major role in the draft of the Jan Lokpal bill. He worked for the well being of the party with his "tan, man and dhan". Yes, when he felt that you, for various reasons were not the right person to lead the party organisation, he frankly told you so. Apart from the reasons of ethical compromises mentioned above, he also saw that you were violating the constitution and rules of the party repeatedly, not allowing any working structure of the party organisation to be created (other than a coterie), and were not interested in formulating the policies of the party.
	For two years, the elaborate reports of the 34 policy committees that we had set up, have been gathering dust because you havent found the time or have the inclination to look at those reports and apply your mind to them. You accuse my father of having stated that you were his third choice for CM after Kiran Bedi and Ajay Maken. That was his honest view after seeing all the shorcomings in your character that he had been observing. I had immediately publicly disagreed with his opinion, but in the light of what has transpired subsequently, particularly the stage managed lumpenism that you got unleashed in the NC meeting, I regretfully wonder if he was right.
	My sister Shalini Gupta, as well as many other highly qualified persons, left their lucrative jobs abroad to help you build credible and efficient systems which would have proper cells and expertise so that it could function as a world class organisation. On repeated occasions you had yourself asked Shalini to give up her job for the sake of the country and said that her role as Organization Development Advisor was only an advisory role and not a formal position with any power in the party as discussed in the PAC before she was appointed.  However it became clear over time that you did not want any professional advice in this matter. Instead you asked Ashutosh who has no such professional expertise to come up with an alternative plan to make each cell of the party organisation an appendage to your coterie and accountable only to you.
	It is true Arvind that I have not contributed as much as you for the party. I have not fasted, nor gone to jail. I have been mostly involved in my various PILs against various scams, 2G, Coalgate, the CBI director, 4G, the Reliance Gas robbery, against GM foods, Nuclear Power Plants, destructive Hydel projects, Section 66A, Tobacco and Gutka, etc. I have spent the rest of my time giving legal and other advice to the party and fighting its cases in court. I have never been interested in any executive posts and I have seen my role in the party mainly as a person who will try and ensure that it remains true to its founding principles. And it is for this reason that I have raised my voice whenever I have found it to be slipping from its path.
	Arvind, this party was founded with a lot of idealism by thousands of people, especially young people, who came out and spent a lot of their time, effort, energy, money, sweat and blood in order to create a vehicle for alternative politics, in order to create a party that would practice clean and transparent politics. But unfortunately, all those principles are being betrayed by you and your coterie, who are currently in control of the party. And it has become a supremo-oriented, high-command culture kind of party.
	You feel that you can rectify everything by running the Delhi government well in the 5 years that you have. You think that if you deliver on governance, people will forget what you have done to the party. I wish you well in that endeavour. Even traditional political parties like Congress, BJP have done some governance.  But the dream that we started with for clean and principled politics and corruption free governance was much much bigger.  The fear that I have, is that after how you have behaved and the character traits that you have showed, this dream of clean and principled politics that the Aam Aadmi party was founded on may well turn into a nightmare. But still, I wish you well.
	Goodbye and good luck,

                            Frankly speaking, I have never supported the AAP as this party doesn't have any policy or vision for a vast country like India. They talk about giving free electricity but they give ticket to someone who has been opposing a major clean source of energy nuclear fission. No clear policy on kashmir, north-east etc regional issues either. No economic or infrastructure model. All they have got is some shinny 'freebies short of policies', which are totally fine to rule a village, town or even a city since the money required to full-fill their election promises will come from state or central governments and they don't need to bother about it. They don't need to develop any big infrastructure either. As a matter of fact it does help in winning elections. However, being a concerned citizen, I will always avoid such parties and vote for the congress and bjp instead despite some corrupt and religiously lunatic persons. The AAP is founded on the anger against both parties, which will fade away with the time. People, associated with the AAP, have visible or invisible political ambitions and due to tough competition in BJP and congress, they are reluctant to leave this party. not to mention that the AAP is in power. Although i never endorsed your views particularly on the referendum, I must endorse your views on the internal politics of AAP transcribed in this letter that has opened the 'bhanumati ka pitara'.

                            I supported the AAP as a party of all good people including Yogen, you and AK. Now dictatorial, arrogant and me only nature of AK has shuttered my perception of AAP being Party of difference, accountable and transparent. AAP as other political parties has become the coterie of sycophants. AK is completely exposed. I repent how could I contribute couple thousands of my hard earned money and emotional capital.

                            Prashanthji, if I may say so, this lunatic called Arvind Kejriwal is too intoxicated by power to understand what you have written in your letter. Leave alone reading to understand it, he would have asked one of his chamchas to read it out, preferably ashuthosh, sanjay singh, preeti memon, ashish khetan, or that sewage-mouthed Kumar (Bakwaas) Viswas. So whatever you write to him trying to explain a few things will be a waste just as advising a congress party leader not to get into corruption or any BJP leader or RSS leader not to issue foolish statements. These people will never learn and that is a pity! As for kejriwal, he is best ignored.....dont sully your image by immersing yourself in a pool of sewage water!

                            I do not quite understand your intent - why single point agenda to go after AK? Politics is all about mud slinging and you are making just that. Don't claim that you are looking for creating alternative political party for the country when you don't have required leadership qualities to create one. No leader is devoid of flaws. Do not look for utopian political organization - there is never one and I don't believe YOU can create one. Good luck anyways.

        Nthng will happen now. He is well established now in politics. The ppl of Delhi will continued to be misled by his social media team who portray him as "Nayak". Just because now you are saying, he won't become 'Khalnayak'. Rather ppl will blv that it's sour grapes for you. And don't forget his friends in media. He has incredible reach and grip on some media house. Probably you was also one of the person who helped him build this kingdom. Look what have you done !!!

                            After seeing all that has happened in the AAP in the last month, one wonders if even dreaming about the principles that AAP stood for at least in theory, when it began, is impractical in today's political situation. But the hopes that Anna movement had awakened among people largely due to the clean image of those who helmed the revolution, were real and passionate. It's indeed sad to see the death of that dream due to the ego of some opportunists. Very sad!

                            Mr Bhushan, you have done a great disservice to the movement for alternative politics by hiding the true nature of Arvind Kejriwal. Some time back I read the book 'Swaraj' written by Kejriwal. Only if I knew he is merely paying lip service to the concept of Swaraj. Shame on Kejriwal. What a waste of time.

                            There are regular politicians.  People really do not expect a whole lot from them.  When they betray your trust, it is no big deal.  It is almost expected.  You do not have great expectations.<br/><br/>
In Kejriwal's case, he started out fine.  He build the dreams of lakhs. Then he got a taste of the power.  He had decided to compromise everything to get the power. Then, suddenly Kejriwal is CM with total dominance and he has absolute control of the party. As the saying goes. 'Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely'. That has become true in case of Kejriwal.<br/><br/>
If Bhusan/Yadav wanted AAP to lose, all they needed to do was to resign a month before the elections. That would have ensured AAP's defeat.  They did not do that.  Just about everything Mr. Bhusan says seems to be true, if you think logically.  There are questionable people in AAP.  The presence of the likes of Ashutosh further consolidates one's suspicions.  The unceremonious sacking of their internal lokpal is disturbing.<br/><br/>
So Kejriwal has betrayed. He has compromised most of his principles. When you have people of less than perfect characters, it will show sooner or later. Not only Keriwal has betrayed his former colleagues, he has betrayed the faith of lakhs of supporters. That makes his betrayal beyond colossal.  At the moment, Arvind Kejriwal has to be the most corrupt person on planet earth.

Most volunteers believed AAP's idea not any one man. Hope AK realises his blunders and revives AAP's idea and bring PB n YY back. Otherwise AAP's idea is dead even if it wins subsequent elections.

                            I think Arvind Kejriwal mustread this letter and reply to Prashant. he is such a genuine guy.He was not in favour to break the party but AK wanted to break and form his own party. from revolutionay how this man has become arrogant ,corrupt and power hungry. I left my job once and took leave from my second job for delhi election 2015.I was there for 2 weeks. I went on buses to compaign ,went on flyovers with hoardings still when I asked question AAP FB admin has blocked me. Is this the party for we have worked and donated? Is this the party we dreamed for? is this the party of khetan ,ashutosh,pandey,anjali damania or party of Arvind,vishwas,prashant ,yogendra,sanjay. I think founder member are the real owner of the party and also the volunties.<br/>
Arvind pls apologies to prashant and yogendra and give them respective posts. they will help you Arvind..pls its a request

                            I agree with many of PB's views in this letter. However, the more I read it, the more I feel PB is not cut out for Indian politics.<br/><br/>
At the current juncture, it is impossible for AAP to be so virtous when you are fighting evil such as the BJP and the Cong. Just look at the Khemka issue - it gets one day of furore in the media and after that everyone forgets it. Campaigns and dharnas alone wont run the anti-corruption movement. You need to get into politics and governance to make the changes.<br/><br/>
That is what Arvind is doing. AAP is delivering a corruption-free government arent they? <br/><br/>
To me thats all that matters. Anything to defeat the bigger evil.

I am bit surprised you couldn't find out the same at the very first interaction with this impersonator. After reading your open letter I am definitely very proud of my judgement. Thanks again for this open letter.

It had educated and smart people of stature to carry  forward with principled leadership and road map to do clean politics. Its now very apparent you are a power hungry dumbo and a man with no word of honor.<br/><br/>

                            A very detailed and much-needed explanation of the inside-deals that have plagued AAP for months. While it would be of interest to see how AK responds to this open letter, this should no doubt cast a dark shadow on his modus operandi. There should even be a concern of illegality (and hence his continuing as a CM) if some of the allegations like participating in false SMS are made to stick as true criminal charges. I always had a lot of respect for Yogendra Yadav, it will be curious to watch what course of action Yadav and Bhooshan now take. Creation of a different party seems obvious, it will be worth watching who the real common people who supported AAP so far will now behave. A little surprised that this news has been out for 2 hours now, and not a single comment is yet posted in response!

Mr. Kejriwal has led the AAP to a historic victory and here is Mr. Bhushan playing petty games. Mr. Bhushan does not seem to understand how political victories come about and what might be needed to form successful governments. <br/><br/>
The cause of the AAP still remains, but good causes by themselves are not sufficient to bring changes. A political party needs to also win to bring lasting changes.<br/><br/>
Mr. Bhushan, if he is so self-righteous, can still work for the cause of AAP. Otherwise, he would be better off leaving politics entirely. He seems naive, vindictive, small-minded and just plain stubbornly self-involved.

AAP is not anyone's personal property but a collective fight to bring justice and equality through inclusive participatory democracy. AAP is answerable to the Aam Admi and its tireless volunteers. When those so called pragmatists trade ideal for good governance quick-fix, they betray the people's interest and the nation on a long run. The jumla culture must end for our good.

                            Seroiusly Mr Bhusan? Are you so naive that you never played a Game of Chess where creating a web of deterrence system is the key to win. Tinkering with congress support is that deterrence system .. you never understand ? It gave AAP multiple maneuvering space --- 1. It kept its own flock together particularly the faction of MLAs who wanted to defect;2, It kept BJP frustrated in its bid ;3. It gave AAP the enough time to prepare.<br/><br/>
 "In November, you called Nikhil Dey and asked him to speak to Rahul Gandhi to convince him to get the Congress party to support. But Nikhil told you that he can't talk to Rahul Gandhi on this issue." This episode was the masterstoke of AAP. However Nikhil Dey declined to talk with Rahul Gandhi , the news reached to Amit Shah. And desparate BJP was forced to dissolve assembly and declare election. Thats the CHECKMATE move , Mr Bhsuan. Are you so naive really??<br/><br/>
As the head of Disciplinary Committee you should have censored your father Mr, Shanti Bhusan, but instead you just distanced yourself from your father's 'honest'  views.<br/>
Sorry Sir,you should not have mentioned your father's seed money of 2 cr Donation. Its in bad taste for a political party where others too have left job which can be measured in moneytary terms. Moreover this mention gives the impression that your father is the OWNER of AAP and he wants to fire The CEO, Mr,Arvind Kejriwal and hire Mr, Yogendra Yadav in his place. Its very very poor taste.

                            AAP party is really Arvind Alone Party, and one day Arvind will be the only person in this party. The way key members are dropping out (6/21, 15 remain) of the party, the day is not very far when almost everyone will walk away. The people who is blindly following him now will eventually walk away for sure if he don't change his HITLAR like governance. You will be shown the door if you speak against him, and that is what is appearing from last couple of weeks. This is not democracy, and soon he will realize it but unfortunately time will not come back.

                            Disappointing to see how much AK has deviated from founding principles of AAP. If you do a mistake, then you follow it up by hundreds of mistakes to cover it up. The best thing is to come clean, accept mistakes and stay united. AK and camp does not seem to be in any mood to do this. I suspect they have done grave mistakes and reconciling with YY/PB will bring these to light and they want to avoid this. The only option they have is to somehow get them out of the way even through unconstitutional means. <br/>
YY/PB and team...keep fighting whether within or outside the party. The bulk of the comments are in support for you...

                            Prashant has spoken from his heart. Anyone following AK can easily make out how ambitious Kejriwal is. He would tell repeatedly that he resigned from IRS not for any power, but his actions show the contrary. It is a matter of time how long he and his coterie will last

                            I am stunned to see the other side of AK. Is this the same man who did drama and kept saying "Are bhai ye me apne liye thodi kar raha hui, aapke liye kar raha hu, desh ke liye kar raha hu." I guess, I shouldn't believe in everything what PB is saying. So I am hoping AK will also write open letter and explain all these charges. But this will happen only if he believe in transparency and openness. Thank you Prashant ji. I am hoping your Goodbye is not goodbye from AAP. Please hang in there else someone like AK will take over such a good cause and make it another Congress party.

                            Another one sided view just like Kejriwal's speech. I see negatives in both PB and AK. You clarified so many allegations by AK convincingly excepting one. Whose idea was it to go national without proving in Delhi? AK and co allege it is you. Seeing this email I would believe them. Considering you are so into contesting in Haryana and its autonomy. People of delhi didn't vote for swaraj in AAP. They saw a corruption free alternative to corrupt Congress &amp; BJP. PB please stick to what you are doing before AAP came into existence (fighting injustice legally). You are an idealist. You are not cutout of politics. There are so many idealists like JP Narayan (Lok Satta) and others who tried politics. How many succeded to power and to implement their promises to people? AK is wrong in approaching Congress or its legislators to form government. But I see his desperation to get into power to show that he can do good to people. How can you not have the urge to get into power, if you want to show difference and provide good corruption free government. Delhi need both AK &amp; PB. AK to provide good governance and people like PB to make sure there is no injustice. Stop cribbing about your injustice in AAP. You are not fit to be in a political party anyway.

                            After reading your long open letter one can only come to the conclusion that AAP is not a political party but a group of criminals who fool the people of Delhi to win the elections. You are as much to blame as you did not stop AAP openly, still you want to stick with AAP? AAP = It's just a name like Tom, Dick and Harry, nothing Godly in it. You are giving it a human Soul of a big collective just to fool the people. Please explain me the difference between "Bharat Janta" and "Aam Admi". Congress is a more honest name? You and YY are just throwing your reputation for Goons like AK, Sisodia.

In this letter you are painting Arvind as a cunning person, however PB and YoYa negotiated with the same person till the end.

                            Hi Prashant<br/>
This is the letter which was needed. When I read it I see the story of two brothers in "Deewar" where the one (Amitabh) who has got all the beating from the society, becomes a criminal (same is said for Arvind in the letter) and the second who had little less beating becomes police officer (Prashant).<br/><br/>
Few things are very apparent from the letter<br/>
1- Both of you want to do something great to change the life of public.<br/>
2- While Arvind has to respect your tremendous power to stand with truth, you must try to understand the psychology of the man who really traveled entire India during elections and got attacked wherever he went.<br/>
3- Such a heart-broken man with such actually may take examples from Mahabharat, where Krishna has allowed pandavas to use all tactics to kill Kauravas. (should be never tried by a normal human being)<br/>
4- I think this letter sets a platform for "saying sorry" from both sides.<br/>
5- General public must proud of you two who are so committed for their well being. IS THIS NOT RARE in this selfish world.<br/><br/>
Hope this message atleast reach to two people (Arvind &amp; Prashant)<br/>
Thanks

                            And the drama continues...<br/><br/>
AAP cannot survive without its usual dramatics. Now with almost 100% majority --- with almost no opposition, there has to be someone to blame. So why not fight amongst themselves. <br/><br/>
Delhi is rotting because of all the trash, but blame the blame game continues. You guys resigned the first time because of Lokpal, but fired your own Lokpal, when he did not suit your needs. You ridiculed all parties for lack of "Swaraj", even wrote a book about what it means. And when elected, decided Swaraj is bogus. You protested against "one" prostitute in Delhi (in front of the TV and the press), but you forgot that Delhi has one of the largest red light area in India, which apparently no one cares about. <br/><br/>
Sorry, please excuse me when I say AAP is all drama but no action. Your egos have now taken over the real objectives AAP was created for.

                            Prashant ji, I can understand your concern and believe every word you said but i do not also disagree with what Arvind did. He has learnt from last Election that just being honest and kind does not work in politics as you are up against the big fish of the indian politicians filth. To defeat them would take more than clever tactics and bend little things to first gain ground and once in power you can get things done that way should be. The way you suggested Arvind to go by would fail him once again and BJP would be in delhi ruling us. I guess that would satisfy you more than AAP downing its guards a little.

                            I am just surprise on why or how it took so long for people to realize he is a fraud and opportunist. It was clear when he used an old man (by keeping him hungry) to create his own his public image. Remember the days when there were stories in media "Who is this man next to Anna ?", IITian, Ex-TATA blah blah.<br/><br/>
Anyhow, such opportunists don't last and it's a matter of time. His own commandants (Manish, Ashutosh, Sanjay and Kavi Kumar) will betray him to take over.

                            With great respect, Mr. Prashant Bhusan organisations need discipline. Organisation need leaders who can take decision and take responsibility for the same. AK is doing both. You are trying to take decision but not responsibility of building the party. Patience could have solved this conflict in AAP. But it is more about taking control of the party outside Delhi. And AK has rightly put his foot down. Now it's time for you to shut up and do the good work you do for the nation, be in AAP or out of AAP.

                            "Media should play tape when AK said Janlokpal ke liye 100 bar CM ki kursia kurbban. Was he fooling public at that time? as he tried to regain CM post with bribing congress MLAs. He did not succeed but he did tried and for which YY and PB were right to oppose him for not to take this type of unethical step. YY and PB are honest people and should not be out of PAC as well as NE. AK seems hungry of power. Sisodia, Sanjay, Vishvas, Ashutosh, Khetan are chamchas and help ruined party. <br/>
Shanti Bhusan had given one corer rupees to start honest party for the future of our country in the very beginning. He must had knowledge of all these unethical things that is why he was criticizing AK and said we need YY and PB with AK as top leaders. <br/>
Please play that tape of Feb. 10, 2014 and remind AK what he said when he resigned. Was he lying to public as he may have thought out future planning.  <br/>
AAP's MLAs and AAP party should ask him to resign to save the party and if he does not resign then he should be voted out but it sad that his MLAs and Chamchas (Sisodia, Ashutosh, Sanjay, Vishvas) are signing petition to remove PB and YY. <br/>
To save the party, 1. AK must resign or voted out. 2. His chamchas should be removed from leadership role for five years and 3. PB and YY must be reinstated in leadership role in PAC as well as NE."<br/><br/>
It is sad that AK who is selfish, accusing unselfish Shanti Bhusan, Prasant Bhusan and YY. If Bhusans were selfish they could have easily asked for ticket for themselves or for their friends and relatives. Who else have donated such a hugh amount. Shanti Bhusan donated for the suture of our next generation for clean and corruption free government. AK and Catorie ruined for self gain. Now AK became CM, he do not need them so he dump them. If there is any honesty in Delhi's MLAs they should remove AK from CM post. I hope AAP party NC will meet again will take correct its past action and reinstate Prasant and YY and bring democracy to party.

                            Kejriwal - Power corrupt, will do 'anything' to grab power, he promised on his children he would never  ask support from congress, see what he has done. He didn't even spare his children, so how can you believe this man to be honest.? Say, tomorrow in some other state , there comes a situation where he is short of MLA's to form government or some other party need support, do you think he will be honest ? I thought AAP was a movement, but looks like selfish kejriwal thinks it's his own private property. He has to remember AAP is crowd funded party, so whats the rights of all the donors/volunteers? Prashant bhushan is an asset to AAP, on long term with his advice and support will help breed some new genre of leaders and not goons like 'ashtuosh or manish', they need to be kicked out of party. As prashant ji rightly said you will regret this at some point in future but it will be tool late then. It does'nt matter you say your good,honest when you nethier have an opportunity nor power to be corrurpt. But when you have an opportunity or power, will expose who you are. And you stand exposed now as a real you 'DIctator".  God  bless..

That is the only matter. If you can float a party of your own and show it can do something, then we are talking Otherwise it seems you are a freeloader.  Who wants political power and pelf without working for it.<br/>

                            Arvind clearly has egoistic tendencies where he sees his exagerated view of himself. Arvind needs to get back to his roots and AAP's roots and the ideals of swaraj. I wish PB and YY made all these points clear to him months before.<br/>
Arvind reaction towards PB and YY, were largely by his egoistic tendencies of fear, defense that "I am right", "look what you guys did was wrong"<br/>
"its either me or PB" "I cannot work with PB, he has betrayed my trust"<br/><br/>
Arvind has to understand the ideals PB is mentioning here rather than fearing that he may get replaced by somebody as CM. Arvind AAP was created as party of ideals. This implied AAP will NOT resort to the same unethical (no party democracy, high command culture, party candidates with questionable background) means as other party. I urge Arvind to sit with Prasant and come to terms with what he is saying. Arvind needs to suppress his egoistic tendencies and his fear of losing his leadership. If he is man of ideals he will do it without any drama.

                            this is the best reply to your comment:"I agree with many of PB's views in this letter. However, the more I read it, the more I feel PB is not cut out for Indian politics. At the current juncture, it is impossible for AAP to be so virtous when you are fighting evil such as the BJP and the Cong. Just look at the Khemka issue - it gets one day of furore in the media and after that everyone forgets it. Campaigns and dharnas alone wont run the anti-corruption movement. You need to get into politics and governance to make the changes. That is what Arvind is doing. AAP is delivering a corruption-free government arent they? To me thats all that matters. Anything to defeat the bigger evil"
