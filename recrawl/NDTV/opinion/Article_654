Headline::::Every Sign That Kejriwal Won't Last Five Years



DateTime::::2015-06-15T08:02:00+05:30




                                Though I am a Congress Member of Parliament, it gives me no pleasure - no, not even a smidgen of what the Germans dub schadenfreude, the satisfaction one gains from others' misfortunes - to witness the implosion of the Aam Aadmi Party. Like many Indians of an educated middle-class background, I could and did empathize with the anger and frustration that had impelled AAP's early days, and the idealism and volunteer passion that had sustained it. I had my doubts about the narrow-minded fanaticism of some of the party's top leadership and its collective self-righteousness, but I could not quarrel with the desire for an India cleansed of corruption and double-dealing, an India that AAP promised to bring about if only given the chance.
The first time AAP was given a chance, it was with the support and backing of my Congress Party, but after a few weeks of spectacular misgovernance - including a Law Minister harassing black women in their homes, and a Chief Minister sleeping in the streets while conducting a dharna against the Central government - we in the Congress concluded AAP was not fit to govern.
The voters of Delhi disagreed with us earlier this year, flocking behind AAP and giving it a record majority. Many traditional Congress voters, anxious to avoid what seemed the inevitable rise of the hubristic BJP to power, deserted us to vote for the stronger non-BJP alternative. AAP formed a government on its own.It has only been four months, but the experiment is in tatters. This time Mr Kejriwal isn't agitating in the streets, let alone sleeping on them, but AAP seems to have found new ways to disappoint its supporters. The party has all but split after a spectacular round of blood-letting that saw it expelling two of its most prominent and nationally-respected members, as well as its internal LokPal. (What could be a more devastating indictment of AAP's straying from its own ideals than the defenestration of a LokPal, the very institution for which the Anna Hazare movement was created?) The Delhi government of Chief Minister Kejriwal has been engaged in an unseemly and torturous tussle with the Lieutenant Governor, Najeeb Jung, over bureaucratic appointments. It has also declared war on the very media that fuelled its rise to power, threatening legal action and barring or restricting media access to the work of the Delhi government. And the issue that won Kejriwal the most middle-class support - the lowering of power tariffs - has been abandoned, with a 6 per cent increase in power tariffs being announced this week.What does this sorry four-month record suggest? Most damningly, a worrying lack of political maturity, best exemplified in the contretemps over the temporary appointment of a senior Indian Administrative Service officer, Shakuntala Gamlin, as acting Chief Secretary of Delhi for a mere ten days. A huge fuss was made by Chief Minister Kejriwal, whose reckless character assassination of the lady in question was not borne out by anything in her official record and reputation. Worse, the official reason adduced by the AAP government for objecting to her appointment - that she had issued a "comfort letter" to the power companies, thereby revealing her bias in their favour - betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and significance of such letters, which have been issued by many other officials in the past without any such criticism. But it transpired that Ms Gamlin had previously objected to unelected Aam Aadmi Party members, not in the Cabinet, attending confidential closed-door meetings of the Delhi government, and it was this that had incurred the Chief Minister's displeasure.
The fact is that officials must uphold the rules, and mature politicians must respect them for doing so. Governance involves a partnership between elected politicians - who must necessarily devote a large proportion of their time to attending to their electorate, and therefore will not always be focused on their administrative tasks - and bureaucrats, who execute the policies decided upon by the politicians. It is a long-standing truism that no political executive can truly succeed without the cooperation and trust of the civil service. Mr Kejriwal has forfeited this by his disgraceful conduct on the Gamlin affair. He will find it that much harder to get anything done as chief executive of Delhi.
If that weren't bad enough, he has made matters worse by his running feud with the Lieutenant Governor, who enjoys some administrative powers that other Governors don't, since under our Constitution, Delhi is not a full-fledged state. The details of the two duelling men's back-and-forth over appointments have played out in the media like a bureaucratic soap opera, culminating in the embarrassment and absurdity of two IAS officers claiming simultaneously to be the state's Home Secretary. The situation is as farcical as the earlier episode of Mr Kejriwal's Chief Ministerial dharna. Both suggest he does not know how to use the power he sought for the benefit of those he governs.In addition, his carefully projected image of probity and incorruptibility has been coming part at the seams. First came the expulsions of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan, two of the party's most prominent, eloquent and untarnished faces, along with professors Anand Kumar and Ajit Jha, lesser known but highly respected intellectuals. The unseating of the LokPal, military hero Admiral Ramdas, raised fundamental questions about the party leadership's integrity. And the icing on the cake was the revelation that the Law Minister, Kejriwal loyalist Jitender Singh Tomar, had faked his degrees. (I am not entering into the fresh controversy surrounding his predecessor, Mr Bharti, because it is unpleasant to drag domestic, especially marital, disputes into the public arena.)
Then The Hindu reported on June 12 that at least nine AAP MLAs have criminal charges pending against them, ranging from slapping a government official to stocking illicit liquor. How, one may ask Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, is the AAP any different from the parties it vowed to displace?At one time there was even talk of AAP moving beyond Delhi and representing at the least a new option for urban middle-class voters across the country. Today it can barely cling on in the place where it enjoys an unprecedented majority. I seriously doubt whether Mr Kejriwal is (and I don't mean the word in a legal sense) constitutionally capable of holding on to office for his full five-year term.
Arvind Kejriwal first came to public notice as a master of the politics of protest - the rallies, marches, agitations and dharnas at which he excelled were complemented by attention-grabbing accusations against a variety of targets levelled at televised press conferences. But governance doesn't work that way. It requires different skills and talents - patience, compromise, attention to detail, an ability to look at the bigger picture, and staying power - that do not appear to be among Mr Kejriwal's strengths. Civil society activism is no guarantee of the talents required to run an administration. The Aam Aadmi Party experience raises serious doubts about whether a party of protest can ever turn itself convincingly into a party of governance.(Dr Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

Immature voting!! It's not the mistake of AAP, it's their smartness they know how to make indian greedy voters fool. All the best Delhi!!

                            Mr. Tharoor has understood India only through books. It is no secret that  Tharoor fancied himself as the talent that India has been waiting for. His India was mostly in Twitter and his sense of citizenry also is limited to Twitter. <br/><br/>
The point is AK has slogged for 15 years in slums of Delhi before jumping into politics. Unlike Tharoor who was probably frolicking around in NY before jumping into Indian politics, AK has toiled to understand the system and its inadequacies.<br/><br/>
For a Tharoor, whi fancied himself a PM after MMS, it must have been shock to see Congress reduced to 44. AAP and AK's politics is for people - and that is difficult for you and your esteemed leader Rahul to understand.

Jokes apart, well written Mr. Tharoor. I agree with you, this joke of a party won't last 5 years...I, being a common man is embarassed to be represented by this bunch of immature jokers. I don't doubt their intent but they need to learn governance and politics to run a state like Delhi. All can be achieved if they keep their petty "Housing Society" way of functioning aside and realise what the have signed up for.

                            AAP is the first in the line of a series of democratic experiments. Granted they have chosen a poor confrontational and dictatorial route, alienating both the bureaucracy and the vote bank at the same time, whilst not giving an interlude of good governance. Whether u like it or not, PM Modi is also a part of that experiment when analysed objectively, at the risk of being called a Bhakt or a Tard. Ultimately this is all good, and should Swaraj Abhiyaan take over from AAP as the mouthpiece of honesty in politics, it's even better. Politics is dirty only cos the populace shares the same trait. People with a criminal record are appointed by the common man, so who is really at fault?

                            Mr Tharoor, your view of governance is stale- one of compromise and elongating your shelf life thereby relegating public issues to the background. Kejriwal represents a different kind if politics not seen before and maybe that is the reason you have trouble understanding the new style because it is quite different from what u r familiar with.

                            Dr. Tharoor shows weakness not of AAP but in the democracy itself.<br/>
Mobilization of mass (Advani) requires completely different skills than ruling by law (Vajapayee).<br/>
AAP's case was the former was well done and people trusted Kejriwal with the latter where he has done better than some, worse than some.<br/>
That is where 2014 national elections are explainable. Voting for Modi was trying out a promotion but voting for Rahul needed leap of faith.<br/>
Even now Rahul is making the mistake of becoming Advani (mobilizer) rather than Vajapayee (ruler).<br/>
I hope he reads this comment!

                            The problem with Sashi Tharoor is that even if he was half a man (in substance) than Kejriwal then he would not be sitting on a high horse and make patronising remarks and get away. The fact is- Congress and Shashi Tharoor has betrayed the mandate they received in 2009 and squandered it away to bring to centre stage the most right wing force in India today, (Is there any more right wing than BJP-led by Modi today?)The centre of Indian politics has dissolved, the official left in disarray and tailing behind the regional parties the only party with national potential and providing a counter to the BJP-Congress neo liberal political narrative is the AAP, which is playing the role of the official left of centre position.<br/>
When early this year the public in Delhi conducted a mini- electoral revolution, throwing out the entire national parties and sweeping AAP to power,despite many a  early obituary have been written on Kejriwal and AAP.<br/>
Sashi Tharoor fails to understand that AAP is a result of the expression and expectation of the people, not the other way around. And it is because of the continuance of these objective realities on the ground AAP is suceeding and continuing to grow despite criticism and occassional Tomar's.<br/>
Capitalism is in crises, and when we look at Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain &amp; the occupy movements in USA/ London today, when we look at these and then look at the entire build up of the movements since 2010- the Arab spring, the Anna movements and subsequent metamorphosis to AAP, we just but cannot ignore that there is a wave of change sweeping the world and Capitalism is unable to meet peoples expectations any more.<br/>
Mr Shashi Tharoor is wrong because as long as these inherent contradictions of Capitalism are not going to get resolved ( which doesnt looks like getting resolved anytime soon) Mr Kejriwal and the poltics he represents is not going to go away.

If you observe from last time to this time.. More over their MLA's are among the people not like other political parties.<br/><br/>

                            Tharoor has hit the nail on the head. It shows that idealism is a difficult concept when it comes to governance. One has to be practical, because the world is not an ideal place, especially when it comes to human issues. It is also sad, because Indians had high hopes from the AAP before it started to implode under its own contradictions. It will take quite a while before Kejriwal realises that curbing corruption is only one aspect of public service. People have to live in the real world, and be governed accordingly. Maturity is necessary for a CM.

How, one may ask Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, is the AAP any different from the parties it vowed to displace?" <br/>
Mr Tharoor , can you figure out from this question that you are putting up in the media that it is in a way an admittance of the fact that AAP is no different from other parties including congress to which you belong &amp; that COngress is , according to you, a party having MP,s &amp; MLA,s with criminal records, Isn;t it an admittance ?

                            People seem to forget that Rome was not built in a day, AAP is a fledgling and requires time and co-operation from all concerned, but will never get co-operation from other political parties or for that matter from the police, customs, excise etc or from the bar council.<br/>
This is due to the fact that all of them are tied to a particular way of working for the past 60 years, including Mr Tharoor, where you scratch my back I scratch yours has been the norm, It is all pervasive sickness and has very much infected the private sector too since there are many who have migrated from the public sector to the private sector and have carried on this "tradition" which is very important for the private sector to be in the best lobbying position with the govt, It is endemic to India and is prevalent in every nook and corner of this country, this was not the case so prominently in the 70's but really gather stream after the 80's.<br/>
The physiology simply boils down to the fact that in order for the person to survive in his job and provide for his family sycophancy very much prevalent in some class of Indian societies is extensively used, this has caused an almost automatic and set system to be put in place.<br/>
For example it is alleged that the excise, customs and police have a very clear payment system, where unaccounted cash is deposited into accounts of these personnel whether they like it or not and are forced in to joining the system, these men and women who work in this system can never pull them selves out of such a system and can be individually targeted or made social miscast. This desperation to survive comes from the fact that India is a country of many people and each person has to take some position to survive. This behavior is fine tuned all through out life and even after the person is well off, the change effected earlier in life becomes permanent.<br/>
In animal behavior this is observed in animals living in packs like wolves, dogs, hyenas where the weak are sub servant to the Alfa male/female.<br/>
In humans this trait must have been present in the prehistoric ages, but with rapid technological progress it has been relegated to a appendage kind of behavior in some races, but very dominant in the Indian context, may be due to the history that the country witnessed.<br/>
The younger India finds this concept alien mainly due to the fact of higher penetration of education and world awareness due to various forms of media.

                            Not sure how AAP cruises their journey amidst the storm by BJP. by the way, what did Delhi people thought in the fist place for local govt, when elected govt has no powers of any official ?<br/><br/>
one thing is clear.. Mr Tharoor is trying very hard to impress Modi so that, Mr Shashi can find a escape from his own criminal case.. time will tell, if he succeeds...

                            It's too early to suggest that but as the things are going on today,future seems to be uncertain.Feuds between Constitutional authority Lt.Governor and the Chief Minister have gone too far.

                            Mr sharoor   AAP ,s procedure is  a form of frustration because of misuse of power by central govt  in not allowing  AAP to  achieve the purpose . Congress will not return for ten years and could  crumble because of  terrible record of corruption.<br/>
In my opinion AAP, will regroup and reform and return

                            AAP will bring down Jung. Congress noted for corruption is out. (For years.)<br/>
 BJP should allow AAP to fight corruption or else even BJP will suffer.<br/>
Procedures are importantl but not more important than purpose.

                            Modi will be the PM again in 2019. He will do more development during the last 2 years to win again and so on.

                            AAP is fighting against corruption and there will be continued effort from outside and inside the party to  kill its momentum. All we are witnessing is just that. Hope AAP is strong enough to survive and the effort of honest people will not go in vain.
