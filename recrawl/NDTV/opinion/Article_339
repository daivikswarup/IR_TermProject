Headline::::10 Things to Learn From Anurag Kashyap's Ugly



DateTime::::2015-01-02T13:54:00+05:30



(Rishi Majumder is an associate partner at the new media company Oijo)Anurag Kashyap has been quoted saying people have told him Ugly is his best film ever. It's futile to get into such discussions. Everyone will have his or her own take. But what's interesting about Ugly - a film that fuses the genres of emotional drama and thriller-is that it's the kind of film that evokes a mixed bag of reactions, not from different people but within yourself. That's what defines an experiment.Â Here are some of those reactions. (A quick synopsis: the movie is about a child getting kidnapped and a series of events that ensue which expose the Mumbai underbelly as much as the darker side of the city's white-collared denizens.)1. If you decide to beat up someone who hit on your girlfriend in school or college, consider this: there is always the off-chance he will become a cop, stalk you, steal your wife and return the favour.2. Anurag Kashyap and his crew are masters of mood. Their attention to detail ensures you're taken straight to Planet Ugly. You may not identify with this planet, but the magic of cinema lies in making you realize you are separated from it by only 6 degrees or less. I hope, for your sake, it's not less.3. There are fine actors out there such as Rahul Bhat, Vineet Kumar Singh and Girish Kulkarni whom we don't know much about, but whom we should see a lot more of on screen.4. A poor, ambitious, unsuccessful father who loves his child is a popular film and life trope perhaps, but it may also lead to unintended schizophrenia. If you happen to be one, sort out your priorities or watch out for early warning signs.5. Pace does matter. Enormously. Characters may lose their audience at times, or just turn uninteresting, but a film that's well-paced will carry its viewers with it. Editors such as Aarti Bajaj embody this. She repeats her Black (Friday) magic here.6. Yes, those 'No Smoking' disclaimers are obnoxious. Someone has to explain to the Censor Board that an obsessive cop with self-esteem issues and members of the Mumbai underbelly don't constitute role models for today's youth. If they do, then smoking is the least of our problems. I mean, take a hint. The film is called 'Ugly'. Did you have disclaimers saying: "Kidnapping a child may land you in jail" or "The actors in this film do not endorse kidnapping"? 7. Smaller characters make a film too. Like Luca Brasi in The Godfather, Charlie Cheswick in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and so many from Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction or Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. The 'supporting characters' that reiterate the contours and rules of the film's universe can also give you something extra, like a surprisingly pleasant flavor from a dish which you didn't anticipate but which fits in. Ugly has such characters. Assistant Commissioners of Police played by the late Abir Goswami (a quiet but effective portrayal) and Madhavi Singh (a cop who's a tech geek) and other blink-and-you'll-miss-them roles such as the gun peddler who runs something like a dance bar, an Irani cafe manager or an old toy maker.8. Nobody cares about the butler anymore. If you see the film you'll know what I mean. 9. Thievery 101. If you're taking someone else's phone, don't put it into your pocket without turning it off.10. An ending that lingers on in your head long after the film is over-and not because it was unbelievably bad-is a reasonably laudable achievement. Ugly manages this.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this blog are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Watched this movie. Stunned and went silent for about an hour after watching the end.<br/>
Took a pledge that won't watch any of the salman khan, Sharuk khan and Rajinikanth or Vijay, Ajith's movie ever in my life.

                            Good movie. Unfortunately in a country like India people still go by brand names like Amir Khan and watch copied movies like PK. Wonder how marketing can over hype a mediocre movie like PK - when "Om my god" was much better starcast and storyline.

                            "No one cares about the butler anymore." Poor Vinayak. But jokes aside, this movie really caught me off guard. By far, Kashyap's best work. And the ending still haunts me even though I watched the movie three days ago. Take a bow, Anurag Kashyap and bask in the glory of being one of the best directors Indian cinema has at the moment.

                            Anurag kashyap is the best story teller today in India. No bakwaas, bas seedhi baat. He has brought art, reality and quality to film making. Bit relief for the audiences who were so far constantly fed with garbage stuff. Hope the non sense stardom give away to real art of story telling in Indian movies.

                            So don't agree with the article. Instead of appreciating the craft, the writer has got down to nitpicking and most of it is superficial. I personally found the story totally believable. Not because I live in an ugly place but the movie goes to uncover ugliness in all of us. And that's reality. We do not need Ugly to discover the importance of small characters or fine editing. But what comes through how everything has been seamlessly woven together to bring out a dark and edgy story. The thing to indeed learn from Ugly is that Ugly is beautiful.

                            About pt. 6: ".....Someone has to explain to the Censor Board that an obsessive cop with self-esteem issues and..." <br/>
Actually the obsessive cop doesn't smoke a single cigarette in the entire film. The only one he lights, is washed away in the final shot of the movie.
