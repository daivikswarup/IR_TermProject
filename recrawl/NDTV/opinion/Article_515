Headline::::Rahul, Please Note That Modi Takes No Sabbaticals



DateTime::::2015-04-20T02:33:00+05:30




                                (Siddharth Varadarajan is a senior journalist and analyst.)
Politics in India got a little bit more exciting on Sunday with the Congress's leadership declaring war on the Narendra Modi government over the Land Acquisition ordinance, the Prime Minister betraying his anxiety for the first time by delivering a defensive speech full of praise for himself, but dripping with bile towards the media for not adequately propagating his achievements, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) electing a dynamic new General Secretary, Sitaram Yechury.
Modi's speech to BJP parliamentarians covered the usual ground - our government is doing more for the poor than any previous government in the past sixty years - and was intended as a morale booster for his flock. But one sensed the barrel was being scraped when he also took credit for convincing the world, and especially countries like France and Canada, to offer India nuclear reactor technology and uranium. Are memories really that short in politics? BJP MPs clapped when he made that astonishing claim, even though dozens among them had voted against Manmohan Singh in 2008 when the actual deal that opened the doors for nuclear commerce with countries like France and Canada was being negotiated. The nuclear cooperation agreement with France was signed by Manmohan Singh in 2010. The agreement between Areva and Larsen & Toubro that Modi witnessed when he was in Paris last week is at best an appendage to that.
He took direct and indirect potshots at the media despite the fact that he has been treated with kid gloves so far. His praise for VK Singh for overseeing the Yemen evacuation of Indians will further embolden the former Army chief in his intemperate attitude towards journalists. While the Ministry of External Affairs, its two ministers, the Indian Navy and Air India deserve praise for the Yemen operation, Modi need not have pretended as if this was the first time India had moved to evacuate its citizens from a war zone. In 2006, Indians were rescued from Beirut, while in 1990, the Chandra Shekhar government's effort to rescue Indians from Kuwait following the Iraqi invasion of the Gulf state turned into the largest air evacuation in history.
At a time when farmers and the rural poor across India are beginning to feel under siege, it is natural for Modi to feel his political advantage slowly slipping away. What he doesn't want to admit is that the anxiety of farmers is the product of objective circumstances, and not political propaganda or media misrepresentation. Apart from unremunerative procurement prices for wheat, rice and cotton, the damage to crops because of unseasonal rain, the reduction of urea imports during the 2014 winter sowing season, and the dilution of adivasi rights to the forests, farmers and farm workers are now worried about the Land Acquisition ordinance.
For the second time in two weeks, Modi used his speech to put some distance between his government and Mukesh Ambani, the businessman whose name is a lightning rod for public anger over the government's pro-corporate biases. However, it is evident that the land ordinance is being brought in to make it easier for businessmen like Ambani to acquire farmland, and more difficult for farmers to resist their takeover.
While the Modi government is vulnerable to a political movement built around the issue of land and rural distress, it is not certain how effectively the Congress will be able to take advantage of this. The man billed as its future leader, Rahul Gandhi, took an unexplained leave of absence just when the issue was hotting up. Sunday's rally was timed for his return but the speech he delivered, though clever in parts, meandered and lacked the linearity and emotional appeal of Congress president Sonia Gandhi's own remarks. His anecdotes seemed disconnected, and the point he was trying to make, especially about the Australian diamond mine, was totally unclear. His repeated use of the English word 'bill' to describe the Land Acquisition law passed by the Manmohan Singh government was awkward. Despite reading from a written speech, Sonia Gandhi established a greater connect with rural India than Rahul Gandhi's extempore performance. Where he spoke loosely of the fears of 'kisan aur mazdoor', (suggesting, therefore, that he would also talk about industrial and mine workers), she used the correct phrase 'khet mazdoor', or farm workers. She mentioned the crop damage due to unseasonal rain. And she also had the political sense to thank the farmers who had come for the rally, taking time off from the busy harvest season.
The biggest mistake Rahul committed was to dwell at length about how the Congress-led UPA government was better than Modi's. While several commendable initiatives were taken during the time - eg. NREGA and the farm debt waiver - the Manmohan Singh years were not a golden period for the Indian peasant. In any case, when the Congress stood on that record and lost in 2014, there is little sense in trying to fight those battles all over again. Just as Modi needs to realize his government cannot guarantee its political future on the basis of merely running down the past, Rahul Gandhi must understand that praising the past will not get the Congress anywhere.
Curiously, neither Rahul nor Sonia presentedÂ  a political roadmap for where the Congress's opposition to the land ordinance would go from here. Nevertheless, the fact that they held the rally in the first place means that the party intends to fight things out.
Who will front this battle? If Sonia Gandhi's performance was not that of a leader on the verge of retiring from active politics, Rahul Gandhi's speech suggests he still has some distance to go before the reins of the Congress will be safe in his hands.
Politics is a bloodsport and not a hobby or indulgence. Modi takes no sabbaticals. Even when he is abroad on official business, he believes in fighting his party's opponents. The coming parliamentary session will be a test of how serious the Congress heir apparent is about embracing the burdens of leadership.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

Modiji has got mandate for 5 years and he would certainly take us to the glory for sure. Go Modiji go. Please Pass Land Acquisition Bill by calling joint session. We million of youth of this country want jobs and only Industries can give us jobs and not fragmented pieces of agricultural land.

                            So as per the author every agreement made in foreign tour of Modi was actually the contribution of congi. Then Modi hasn't done anything in these 10 months so Amul Baby is the better choice etc etc are the claim. So after all these introspection and rallies I am eagerly waiting to see how many seats congi is going to win in Bihar!

                            Siddharth the NRI journalist need to live in India to understand India. Sitting in AC room and writing and articular is very different from standing in the middle of war like situation and manage rescue of human being irrespective of country or origin. All cut and paste previous rescue comparison he made were done under UN supervision. Situation in Yemen was very different. It was a war where even the mighty US and UK with all political and military power had to rely on Indian mission to rescue few (not all) of their own citizens out of harm's way.<br/>
Even the foreign media had acknowledged the role of role of VK Singh. The only reason this mission was successful was because of VK Sing's previous military experience.<br/>
Take your AAP hat off and try to be objective journalist.

                            To write few lines of criticism on Prince Rahul,<br/>
Mr.Varadarajan had to bash Modi in 20 lines.  Why?  So, that you can give a misleading headline to get Modi fans to read. So you know there are plenty of them.  Have you wondered why so many who read English like him, except those who call themselves Journalists.  Indian Brahmins especially the one from TN, Bengal, Kerala and Maharastra have destroyed India. Of course there are exceptions.  Like Bharathier who himself was treated badly.   Begali Brahmins and TN Brahmins were stooges of British. Then Begali Brahmins led the masses with communism. Kerala one did the same with communism and Maharastra one with rabid racism.  Now the elites are again ruining Indias progress by supporting incompetent opposition who thinks India is their family property.  In any other country press would have question this kind of absence.  even the persons patriotism would have been questioned.  What is the guarantee he has not met and brain stormed with Chinese or with evangelicals.

If attack on Modi govt with blatant media lies is treating with kid gloves, then I shudder to think what will happen with kid gloves removed. India needs credible opposition to Modi, no doubt about it. But Rahul Gandhi is not  an option at all.

                            This is a trend I discern in your reporting where your main title has no nexus with the substantial theme of your writing. While the titles in those three previous articles have been catchy (read "misleading") enough, sadly the content was in some other parallel universe. Is it a linguistic gimmick to garner attention of the readership or is it symptomatic of a greater malady reflecting complete loss of any semblance of journalistic reporting? Or maybe an entrenched compulsion of being part of corporate media (read "NDTV") passing itself as full-blooded liberals?

                            There is absolutely no problem with an anti-establishment ideology and it actually adds vigour to the debate and makes it meaningful. But once you do that, so you not think that it is imperative for the purity of the argument that the headline of the article captures the substance of your point and not suggest something completely contrary to the gist of your piece, merely because your last line says so. I have been noticing this trend in some of your recent articles. My short point, therefore, is not about an judgement of your ideology. You are entitled to hold your views and express them as vociferously as you like but we could be a little less cagey, couldn't we?

                            It looks like both the general's comment on "presstitutes" and Modi's barb on some people who will never see any good in his government has hit home. It is quite clear that he is referring to the tired and biased journalists like yourself, Kumar Ketkar etc. Unlike Mani Shankar Aiyer who makes absolutely no bones about his singular lack of objectivity , there are others masquerading as "independent" journalists , but whose objectivity is just as suspect as MAS who is the gold standard. We have had 60 years of socialism glorifying "jai kisan" and has the old and tired ideas ( once again expounded by the so called "young" Rahul Gandhi yesterday ) done them any good ? Have any of your ilk ever questioned whether farming with small land holdings viable at all? Despite zero income tax , fertilizer subsidy , periodic loan waivers , year after year we only hear of farmer's suicides. Add to that there is no shortage of food , which logically suggests that farming cannot viably employ such a large percentage of our population and that the same amount of food can be grown with modern technology and larger land holdings by vastly fewer farmers. So we have two choices ... maintain status quo , keep paying lip sympathies to our "garib kisan" , write hypocritical editorials in papers on their plight and feel good about it OR get small farmers off farming , use the land to develop infrastructure and industries so that the people can be weaned off farming and be employed more profitably in manufacturing industries. The former option is what we have been doing all these years and the results are there for everyone to see. The latter option will be opposed tooth and nail by journalists such as  yourself as being "anti poor" which is exactly what is happening right now. Irony of life .. the quality of life of the poor can be changed only by following "pro rich" policies.

                            Yes true, Rahul takes sabbaticals, but Mr. Modi goes globe trotting shaming India in front of the world, promotes himself without any visible action to develop the country. Modi can atleast visit all the States in India before he starts off on another global tour and hopefully it will not be for an election campaign.

One has to face and endure reality if one intends to serve those who one intends to! Country and political systems are not any family's private possession and let there be no sycophancy or "chamchagiri" by anyone as it will harm in the long run! Be brave ye all well meaning people in Congress, rise on the occasion and give the people a credible opposition (no sabbaticals allowed) for the sake of democracy and patriotism!

                            Vadarajan your analysis is the most accurate about the current situation. Narendra Modi's foreign trip was marred by protests which is censored by Indian media. Modi's popularity is at its lowest amongst the common people but Rahul Gandhi particular and Congress in general is a boon for Modi. Other than Congress any opposition will compel Modi to beg DOSTI BANEE RAHEY.

                            The heading of the opinion piece is,  like the author misleading.  He rants on and only in the second paragraph of the piece does he allude to the sabbatical business.  Those of us who are seasoned observers of such matters will know that neither speech was authored by the speakers; both were composed by flunkies.  Emphatically, Rahul did not, as suggested by Vardarajan, speak extempore.  He had prepared hard!  However, hard work can never conceal a fundamental lack of talent.  There is also no doubt that mother and son knew the contents of each other's speeches to the last full stop.  This business of who was better or who made a greater impact is of no consequence; neither mother nor son will ever assume the responsibility that goes with power.  There are too many seasoned flunkies to do the responsibility bit as was evident to the whole world when MMS was PM.  He was, as the whole world knows, without any power but had to take responsibility.  As I write, I am listening to Kharge, in Parliament make a nuisance of himself in his aggressive, boorish manner.  Scindia, scion of a privileged 'royal' family that has never had anything in common with the poor is putting in his two paisa worth.  What is obvious is that neither of these two characters has the remotest chance of assuming leadership of the Congress party; that is strictly the property of the dreadful Nehru-Gandhi parivar.  The slave mentality of Kharge and Scindia is symptomatic of the reason the British were able to rule India for 200 years.

Modi is doing a lot, which will take India ahead and in that course all its people too. Unfortunately you guys are given platform as intellectuals. <br/>
Yes there is a concern about this government. This government is very pro development, they should try more to see how sustainable all this will be. Surely Modi's effort will make India a super power but at the same time we want it sustainable. None of the so called intellectuals have come ahead with some constructive points or even right criticism. Shame on today's journalism.

Do u know the pulse of common man?One is you are ignorant about provisions of land acquisition act. It is very clear you are part of land mafia lobby which wants to keep farmers under seize. They want avoid direct link between farmers and GOVT which is paying 4 times the earlier rate for their land.

Here this person has clear view like what mistakes our PM is doing(No one is perfect, its ok), what good he has done. How bad the speech of RaGa was and also how better Sonia is than his son in politics. At least we can have some view after such an analysis.

It is Congress government but run by BJP. No difference. So far we didn't see any real BJP achievement. It is betrayal to the people. BJP thought Land Bill will it's one achievement but that is causing great anxiety to farmers. It is one of the political suicide, Without rural support (farmers) it can't capture any government.

This young man has just returned from a sabbatical and they made him revert back to the same dirty game of politics forcing him to tell lies like themselves. Rahul, wherefrom did you get the facts of Modi having taken thousands of crores from industrialists in Gujarat for giving them land? Would you and your government have allowed him to survive even for a day were it true? If this is what you are promising to the nation, let me tell you bluntly that you are doomed. There was some internal conflict ( the Mahabharat every Bharat experiences)which made you undergo vipasana. Were you to waste it in this way? Either devise your own policy and programme or give up politics, because once the top disappears in due course, there will be anarchy in the party. What a joke to see the yoke on your shoulders after making a meat of the bullocks?

                            Mr. Vardarajan why not you start propogating the Robert Vadra model of land acquisition. May be you will also get a piece of the pie for praising it instead of praising that dumb Raul Baba who will not pay you anything for all your efforts in praising him left, right and centre.

Excellent piece. Some of the well couched barbs are interesting. However your pathological dislike for right wing party like BJP trickles our very clearly. No problem - mainstream media with honourable Menlo like you will try to work hard at supporting congress. We still will try the Modi model - at least it will be different from the UPA one.

It is better to provide an objective criticism than rhetoric ..... giving criticism generously and never appreciate for good work of any Indian will not make you a better editor.<br/><br/>

                            Nothing Wrong in taking sabbaticals. Why do you compare him with Narendra Modi. Modi isn't a icon to follow. He is newly elected PM. He has own style and similarly every one has their own's.Think about US president. He also takes sabbatical quite often. <br/>
Even when he (Modi) is abroad on official business, he believes in fighting his party's opponents. That indicates, instead of representing country as PM of a country, he is behaving like member of ruling party and criticizing opposition parties on foreign soil. Is that what you expect of PM of a country? Already parliament has been degraded to such an extent. Now, With all this mud slinging, PM of country like India which harbors more than one billion population behave like this people will not only laugh at us but they make mockery of our democratic system which alredy become one by these people.<br/><br/>
Apart from speeches, Let Modi should concentrate on deliverables.

                            I am of the opinion, like Judiciary, police, Buerocrates media should also be impartial. All the coloumnist though entitled to have their views but they should not be biased and twist the facts the way Shri S vardharajan always does in his column. He has written the column as if he is a person who hates whatever BJP or Modi does and at the same time advising the Ghandhis(even though whatever wrong they do) what they should do to dethrone Modi. My advise to Shri Vardhrajan please go to them and tell them directly what they should tell to the people of this country. Sir please have some self respect. Don't get blinded by either your hatred or sycophancy to wards Gandhi family. Think about your country.<br/>
 I want to ask few questions from shri S. V.<br/>
1. Do he love his country? if yes how can he approves of the looting which took place during the regime of Congress.<br/>
2. How a self respecting Indian can support a Party which support the Monarcy.<br/>
3. What did Modi Govt. do in last 10 months which made the life of poors, Farmer miserable.<br/>
4. All communal statements took place during the current period are becoming the front line news today while similar things were happening in the past regularly. take the examples of Church attacks.<br/><br/>
It is my advise to all columnist please be unbiased while writing any opinion, news information etc. Sir as I already said Journalism is a noble job please don't spoil the profession

                            While Varadarajan and Ashok Malik (who also wrote on this very topic for NDTV) both write very well, Malik bothers to back up his arguments with facts. We haven't forgotten how wide off the mark Varadarajan's articles before the general election turned out to be!<br/><br/>
It is OK to criticize the Land Acquisition Bill, and undoubtedly many farmers are worried. But what of the tens of thousands of crores worth of infrastructure projects already stalled because of difficulty in acquiring land? Many Congress ministers had warned about this some years ago.<br/><br/>
Also, Malik pointed out the Niyamgiri conundrum. For sure, some locals will have objections to an industry coming up in their area - but many, many more want the industry to come up so they can get jobs! This is why the Congress candidate lost humiliatingly there in May 2014, inspite of RaGa's "success" in stalling the bauxite project.<br/><br/>
People want jobs - and crores of them. That's why they voted Modi to power. Land acquisition may have to be made easier if industries are to come up easily, and only industries can provide mass employment. If people liked what the Congress has already done, they wouldn't have voted them out so totally.<br/><br/>
It is not the media that is treating Modi and VK Singh with kid gloves; it is the other way round. Earlier governments may have carried out similar evacuations, but VK Singh did his job exceedingly well too. No taking away credit from his for personally overseeing the entire operation. To focus on a sarcastic comment while overlooking the actual story was really abysmal of the media. That some politician used a derogatory word for the media is not news to me; that a politician for once did a good job is! I don't care who calls whom what, there's enough of that on Page 3!

The Kuwait evacuation started after Gujral was embraced by Saddam Hussain and US forces extending full cooperation.<br/>
Tne operation lasted two month entirely undertaken by Indian Airlines. Only challenges were issues of overtime to late <br/>
arrival at Mumbai and import duty on gold brought by Indians.To compare it with Yemen evacuation is totally misplaced

                            Modi talks well, and the way he talks, seems like he is doing everythig and everybody is useless. Yes, he is hard working, and committed, But committed to what? Is that a wrong question to ask? I think we should always be questioning the motives of the political class, so that they do not get carried away by there own dreams and hidden agendas, whichever party it might be. Blindly targeting Modi or Rahul, or Blindly praising Modi, as so may comments seem to indicate, does not bode well for our country and society.

NREGA and the farm debt waiver" The why cong ended up with just 44?.

Like many other Indians, the authors wants the nation to change under Modi in a matter of minutes like poor protagonist in Indian movies become rich over a song.<br/><br/>
A "journalist" should know that for a nation filled with corrupt politicians and people, it takes years to revert the damages done by the UPA and only Modi's plan can change the Nation now. If my fellow Indians had felt that Modi is no good to the nation, he wouldn't have won. So stop Modi bashing and do real journalism.

It was VP Singh and IK Gujral was the foreign minister. I was at that time in Kuwait and still remain grateful to VP Singh, Gujral and Arif Mohd Khan the Civil Aviation Minister at that time.

                            Mr Varadha Rajan,<br/><br/>
What do you expect the Prime minister to say or do?<br/>
If there are things other than truths, come out with that  and engage him.<br/>
Don't be an irrational opponent.<br/><br/>
Why don't you clearly say that, you represent a group of powerful people, possibly from U S A ( not the government), where they have a serious plan for the stunting the growth of India.<br/><br/>
You act as if you are critiques of Congress people also. That you think will give you a position of balance. <br/><br/>
I dont want to say this about any body but I am forced to say the following about you. Some body like you should never have been there in the first place, for you  bring out only negativity in the society.You see everything only through a squinted pair of eyes and you can see nothing good happening, while the whole world is hopeful of an Indian turn  around. <br/><br/>
You have always amplified 100 folds, the unfortunate but unacceptable utterances of some of the fringe elements in the ruling disposition time to time ( I am definitely not referring to statements on conversions and reconversions. They are very serious and we should have an extensive debate, for which the ilks of you are hardly ready) and you give a picture that the country is being torn down . And you say, the PM should take action every time. That is a ridiculous thing one can hear from a mature journalist( which of course, you are not) . <br/>
Many a time, the best solution is just to ignore. Can you point out  anything from the Government or the its various arms, of a conduct, which is outside the constitution or say communally differentiating?<br/><br/>
Just like the BJP and Modi, ignore, even to day all the nonsenscical comments from the likes of Mamata B, D Obrien, Ahmed Patel and a whole lot of others,about which you had no questions at all, it is a good idea to ignore negatives.   <br/><br/>
When the unfortunate Church attacks happened recently, all the journalists including you, took it upon yourselves to condemn the majority or at least some prominent elements in the majority community,and you took even the help from Obama to  put your point across. ( You never wanted to interpret what obama said, correctly. He said if India were to develop well that is possible one if it remains secular. All the efforts of any great government will come to knought if there were sectarial troubles among the population).   However,  when the enquiries conducted in each one of them, proved that they were all mostly law and order problems and even in that, no majority community personnel were involved, none of you repeat none of you had the guts to say sorry.Even today you keep on saying what you have been saying. In the same period of time, any number of temples have been attacked all over the world including different parts of  India, you did not see any thing wrong happening.             <br/><br/><br/>
Please come out with your true colour Mr Varadha Rajan.  <br/><br/>

                            Rather than criticizing that joker who suddenly disappear from national politics to re-invent himself and aspire to lead this country, this gentleman is busy in talking about memories of BJP MP's. Fact is that people are sick of your kind of biased intellectuals who always look at the darker side of anti congress party while you always choose to look at brighter side of corrupt &amp; dynastic congress who can not think of abandoning this joker even after such a long proven failure record in politics. I still remember how much this media took a swipe on Lal krishna advani while he was prime ministerial candidate and labelled him "PM in waiting" who will always be in waiting. I think you memory is also very short when you forget that issue which congress was pushing when they were in power are now being push backward by them, it is simple politics. I am not a BJP fan you your kind of reporting has forced me to write this comment since i am unable to differentiate between your wisdom and Many shankar Aiyar's wisdom. I have watched your TV debates and even a fool can see your bias.

                            As per the 2013 Land Act, 80% of the land owners  are to give consent for selling their lands. Now, it is reduced to 70% for some cases. How, this reduction is anti-farmer. If 70% is anti farmer, why UPA did not bring the 100% clause in its ACT? Even now, they can demand for 100% consent from farmers, instead of opposing 70%

                            Modi cannot afford to take any sabbaticals. There are many waiting in the wings of BJP to jump in and oust him at the earliest opportunity. So Mr Modi, don't ever think of taking any sabbaticals, you will have no seat if you chooses to return.(Varadabhai may not be aware of this fact.)

                            Can someone tell me what miracles Bhagwaan Modi has accomplished in the past one year? Apart from the miracle of having hordes of andh-Modi-bhakts line up behind him, what has he accomplished? Or if he has not, how long will it take him to do something meaningful for the country? Is there any time limit? 10 years, 20? 60 years maybe?

                            I dont think RGV (Rahul gandhi videshi) has done anything to take such a long holiday or he might have been kicked out of rest of the villages he had to go to sleep.... And there is a gap of around 20 years between them too....Not a Modi fan but this is one place where he is better than RGV but not good for the general public

                            @Deep: Last sixty years of dirt? The keyboard &amp; computer you're typing your comment on, did Modi make it? The networks you r using to spread your opinions, did Modi make them? Did Modi make ISRO? Did Modi sign the nuclear deal between US &amp; India? No. Did Modi sign nuclear deal between France &amp; India? No.<br/><br/>
In one year, WHAT EXACTLY HAS MODI DONE? Please tell us ordinary fools, what miracles your God has performed in the last year.<br/><br/>
Modi is no God, nor any avatar of any God. People like you who think that Modi, and only Modi, can do anything good for the country are nothing more than fascists.

                            Rahul should have first informed about Where he went all these days? All of a sudden appearing and making meaning less comments may fool only the fools and that too only few times, if it happening all the time, Even the fools, whom he is thinking as they listen his words will realize and make him the real fool by denying him by vote. It's important for India's best.

                            Siddharth - True, Modi does not go on Sabbaticals. But he goes only on overseas tours. Like Modi, also note that Rahul does not know the art of rhetoric speeches and drama-oratory full of slogans and no action to take home.
