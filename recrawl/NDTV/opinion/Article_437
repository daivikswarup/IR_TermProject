Headline::::Jaitley's Budget is for Sahib Log



DateTime::::2015-03-02T22:55:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)
	Every year around the end of February, the sahib log and the pink papers (and now, increasingly the TV news channels) whip themselves into a frenzy over what the Budget holds for them.
	There is no equivalent frisson of excitement among the broad masses of the Indian public. One reason, of course, is that the broad masses pay no direct taxes. Therefore, there is no incentive to discover how much less or more the taxman is going to snatch from them. But more important, I think, is that at least since we entered the era of neo-liberalism, the Finance Minister concentrates his attention on the corporates (who make or break his reputation) - and the corporates on him to see what's in it for them.
	The vast majority of Indians working in agriculture and allied activities (dairying, fisheries), as unskilled labour on the farms, in construction and domestic services, in petty retail and nano-to-micro-industries, are neither looking to the FM nor is the FM looking towards them.
	Of course, there is a ritual invocation of the poor and the kisan by every FM at the start of every budget speech, but once he has got over that hump, he quickly moves on to more congenial matters such as augmenting the annual Rs. 6 lakh crore subsidy given to fat cats and written off under the heading "revenues foregone".
	(However, not one FM mentions the figure in his budget speech for fear that if the figure is boldly stated, sharp questions will be asked why if this subsidy to the rich can go up year after year, it is only the subsidies to the poor that come under annual attack from sources who wish to portray the rich as prudent and the poor as profligate).
	Unsurprisingly, this has happened again this year. Arun Jaitley shed a few crocodile tears for the kisan and khet-mazdoor before devoting five-sixth of his speech to his real clients. And this despite the fact that in this year where the (statistically fudged) claim is that India is growing at plus seven per cent, will cross eight per cent next year and soar to double digits thereafter, the Government's Economic Survey 2014-15, Vol II, chapter 5, divulges the tragic truth that Indian agriculture has grown by only 1.1 per cent in this miracle year.
	With nearly half our workforce engaged in agriculture and nearly 60 per cent of rural households essentially dependent on agriculture for their household income, this horrifying story of stagnation in a period of stratospheric growth has merited neither the attention nor the concern of the Finance Minister nor any of the sahib log. It took a heroic effort on my part to get in even a word edgewise on this in the televised budget discussion in which I was entrapped for some six hours on Budget day. We, the sahib log, just don't seem to care.
	Every single agricultural crop of significance is down. Our output of rice, wheat and coarse cereals (jowar, bajra etc) is down; our output of oilseeds and pulses is also down. Only monkey nuts are up! What has saved the rural economy is dairying and poultry. All this is spelled out in the Economic Survey but merits no attention in the Budget speech. Moreover, the Economic Survey details what needs to be done to pull this most vital sector of the Indian economy out of the mire in which it is sunk. But the Finance Minister (and his PM) appear to have skipped Chapter 5 which succinctly sets out the steps to be taken.
	Chapter 5 emphasizes that the biggest lacuna in Indian agriculture is agricultural research and extension to address the twin problems of yield and productivity. It says "the paradigm shift in yield/productivity required for the second green revolution" renders it "imperative to make Indian agricultural growth science-led" and a nation-wide network of extension services provided to carry the message to the farmer. Studies show that two-thirds of Indian kisans do not even know that extension workers are supposed to get this new knowledge to them gratis. Yet, apart from Rs. 100 crore set aside in Jaitley's last budget for two additional institutes of excellence, the subject is not even mentioned in this year's speech.
	Moreover, no recognition is accorded to the heartbreaking story of agricultural credit despite numerous studies, most recently the 2013 NSSO 70th round, establishing conclusively that "the crop loans are not reaching intended beneficiaries and there are no systems and procedures in place at several bank branches to monitor the end-use of funds." These alarming facts are underlined at a time when 40 percent of farmers' credit requirements are still being secured from "informal sources" (which translates as the village middleman) and "usurious moneylenders account for a 26 percent share of total agricultural credit", both "issues that need to be addressed on a priority basis". The share of long-term credit in total agricultural credit has collapsed from 55 percent to 39 percent. Worse still, the bulk of so-called rural credit is availed of by corporate farmers from urban branches, while a disturbingly large number of kisans are not even aware of the credit facilities being made available by Government.
	Unless and until the Panchayat Raj Institutions are integrated into the agriculture credit and extension services system, there is no way "last-mile connectivity", underlined by the Survey, can be ensured. Yet, the Finance Minister did not even whisper the word "panchayats" and drastically cut the allotment for the Union Ministry of Panchayati Raj from over Rs. 6500 crore to just Rs. 95 crore.
	This is clearly a government that either knows nothing of India's real needs or is so obsessed with its corporate sponsors that it cannot look beyond the factory to the farm. The tragedy, therefore, continues of 60 per cent of India's population that lives in her villages having to make do with just 13 percent of the nation's GDP.
	Astoundingly, this neglect of the rural economy is received with applause by those who wish to see investment in private sector industry and PPP infrastructure rise exponentially. Agriculture's disaster in recent decades has  been the drying up of public investment in agriculture. For a whole decade, public investment has stagnated; it is now running at about one-eighth of total capital formation in agriculture. The Survey says, "Given the vast investment needs of this sector, greater public investment would only help increase private investment." Yet, the Finance Minister has seen fit to glide away altogether from this desperate need of the real aam admi - the kisan and the khet-mazdoor. This is deeply depressing as growth is ultimately for the people and needs to find reflection in employment. Agriculture is the most employment-intensive segment of the economy. Investment, public or private, in private big business and PPP projects leads to capital-intensive and technology-intensive growth, that is, jobless growth of the kind we have suffered for the last two decades and more.
	Where then should the priority lie? Please don't ask Mr. Jaitley because the poor man does not know. All he sees are the bulging bags of private domestic and foreign industrialists.  Hence, a Jaitley budget that is principally addressed to these corporate big-wigs and their fellow-sahib log.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Ha ha :) And you would rather they give empty slogans like "Garibi Hataao" and "Women empowerment" but take measures to ensure India remain poor for ever. Let Indians be always dependent on state. Let them have no real jobs, no education, but give them 5 Kg of free rice and 50 Rs to dig ditches for 100 days a year. Forget that 90% of money that state spends gets usurped by middlemen. It's time that this stupidity ends! <br/><br/>
Sorry, Mr. Aiyyar Indians don't believe in your words. No wonder you lost your deposit in the last election.

                            The moron strikes again!  This time he is playing victim!  His statement 'the televised budget discussion in which I was entrapped for some six hours on Budget day' is a straightforward lie.  I saw the debate, Aiyar was a willing participant who could have walked away any time.  The only problem was that Aiyar was out of his depth.  In any case, shouldn't the reply, or more accurately 'attack' on the budget have been led by Aiyar's choice as next PM, a certain Rahul Gandhi? And where was Aiyar's lord and master?  Bangkok? Uttrakhand?  Who knows?  Who cares!  As for Aiyar's analysis of the budget, he has probably got a research assistant to come up with a few 'negatives' and based his whole tome on those negatives.  So that Aiyar knows, not all of us regard industrialists and business people as being bad people who will exploit Aiyar's peasant friends.  One generation of Tatas have done more good for India than a thousand generations of Aiyar's ilk.  Tata and other industrialists have provided jobs for the masses, steel which is necessary for any modern country, goods that people want, roads that people use, hospitals that people require, petrol and petroleum products, 'pukka' roads, ports, bridges, houses and the list goes on and on!  India can not and must not be a subsistence agricultural country.  A million jobs are required every month for the youth of the nation and included in this youth are the offspring of the peasants whose cause Aiyar seeks to champion.  Any further analysis of Aiyar's piece will merely give credence to his alleged knowledge.. If there is one fact of life accepted by India it is that Aiyar has no credibility other than in the eyes of his hero Rahul Gandhi.  And finally, his sarcastic description of Jaitley as 'the poor man' who 'does not know' is par for the course.  Aiyar will have you believe that he is the font of all knowledge!  After all, did he not predict that in this 21st Century, Modi will never be PM. Never! Never!

                            Mr Aiyar<br/>
If you think your ideas are so great and wonderful that it solves the problems of India - what have you done to India in the last 60 years?<br/>
Why is that significant number still live in poverty?<br/>
The honest answer is that Congress pays lip service to poor people and the royal service to the corporates. You mentioned corporates are looking to FM, yes because what they see is what they get unlike with Congress govt where everything happens under the table. Every sector/industry/service congress leaders (from top to bottom) looked for commissions - even if it's for death certificate of parents (at panchayat level). You can probably claim corruption from top to grass roots level as your achievement for last 60 years.<br/>
You talk about farmers - what's your achievement - making Lalu as central minister who was involved in fodder scam.<br/>
Hence stop trying to fool people and realize that the time has changed.<br/>
Hope you feel better soon !!

The fact of the life is a humble Chaiwala can become the PM of this country with the blessings of the people but the elitist Cambridge Graduate can only become a coitre to one particular family.<br/><br/>
BTW where is Mr Shajayada ?? Sucha n important Budget Session and he is enjoying overseas... What an aspirational PM candidate we have ? Ha.. !!! A life of full waste !!!

                            One of the unwritten conditions imposed on India by international financial institutins in the 90s due to mismanagement of governance by Janata Dal (supported by the BJP) and SJP( supported by the Congress)was the appointment of an economist-rather than a politician- as the finance minister and India was too weak to resist it .P.V. Narasimha Rao's economic model-though helped to be in power- has only produced jobless growth for over two decades and destroyed rural India -real backbone of India- in about two decades. Unfortunately, successive governments have only been following the model set in  motion by Dr. Manmohan Singh and late P.V. N. Rao

                            A scholarly exposition of fundamental needs of India's economics . He has also subtly brought out the fact that even various governments in which his party was there in the last 20 years did not do what needed to be done and instead kowtowed before corporate houses (money bags) including conditionalities of international financial institutions. All this is not say that there were no leakges and seepages , which neede immediate fixing. The Congress party has been taught a lesson of its life time by the corporate houses (money bags), who were with the party so long as it suited their interests. It is time for the party to adopt a more humanitarian(not egalitarian) economics lest money bags swallow hook, line and sinker the only party with the ideology most suited to India's economic ethos.

                            How is lowering corporate tax is actually very pro poor. How is land reforms and labor reforms true pro poor policy. How leftist laws don't work, short sighted, communist and only mislead, give empty slogans? Brothers, pease read-<br/><br/>
Why not put MANUFACTURING up top? It is the largest jobs creator, and creates jobs for lowest segments of society, the unskilled and semi skilled labor. Right now the poorest indians are landless farm labor who have a job for only 3 months a year during the harvest. <br/><br/>
Mass manufacturing also produces local goods to reduce prices. This increase ppls buying power and living standards from both sides. <br/><br/>
And for mass manufacturing to happen, india needs *labor reforms* to allow companies to be scalable, easy to open and close loss making failed enterprises. And of course they need *land,* cant setup a factory on thin air. Modern manufacturing uses very top secret processes that the samsungs and sony want to safeguard from the other companies so they need 100%.control via *100% FDI in manufacturing*. Also needed are good roads ports to access market and raw materials, ie *infrastructure.* And *reduction of redtape* and fair laws. Lasty india has to compete for industry as thet can easily go to china ot vietnam. So we need to have *competitive tax rates.* If you are giving all other things bit tax rates is lower in vietnam or china, industry will go there instead of india.<br/><br/>
i think indians in power and outside it, have not learnt the hard lessons that 65 yrs of failed socioeconomic policies should have made clear long ago. I have highlighted in bold what india need to do all. Not doing anyone will block it all up.<br/><br/>
If india gets these things right, all other problems will be just too easy to tackle, most will solve themselves.﻿

they should give special status and 5 years economic help to the state. the AP state has a dynamic CM to take it to further level. Please help the state AP.<br/>

                            What Mani should be worried about is that the Panchayati Raj Ministry has almost ceased to exist if one goes by the allocation for it. As for the rest of his comments, they apply equally to the earlier Congress Finance Ministers. What to do? Do not worry, now that Rahul Baba is coming back full of energy to tilt at the windmills a la Don Quixote, why Mani may even become the next Finance Minister. If and when Rahul Baba becomes the PM. Did I hear you snigger? Beware, stranger things have happened. In the meanwhile, be happy that most of the independent commentators have rated this budget very highly. Since the country has elected Modi as PM, and Jaitley is his choice as FM, we all have to be happy with this budget. As I said, Kya Karega?

At least you could have been mindful to the fact that rapid employment generation can save this country from civil war. 33 percent of our youths are unemployed today Mr. Right.

                            Who cares for the poor,"Gharibi Hatao" is just a slogan.This is expected to happen when a lawyer becomes an economist,he immediately pleads for a stay order on the "Gharibi Hatao" programmes.

                            Mr. Aiyar Sahib seems mighty pleased that BJP has created a budget with him in mind rather than the ordinary aam aadmi and chaiwallahs of the country.

                            After a long time, MSA is bang on target- the issues highlighted by him are bang on and this is apolitical- we have reached this sad state due to indifference of governments across the line.

                            Agriculture sector requires immediate attention, otherwise the nation can not progress.In last 25-30 years this sector is most neglected sector as they do not have any lobby and can not pressurize the Govt.Secondly they do not have money bags to influence the politicians and babus.

                            Disgree with Mani - for specific sahib log and not all sahib log. The reduction in coal duty from 55% to 10% helps some specific corporate house with mining interests abroad. Possibly, the same corporate house to whom SBI is planning to disburse further loan for a new project down under.
