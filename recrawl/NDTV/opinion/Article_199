Headline::::Dear Arun Jaitley, Time To Resign



DateTime::::2015-12-31T15:19:00+05:30




                                The DDCA scam is a prime example of how brazen the BJP can be. The BJP, which regularly put the Congress and its ministers on the mat on corruption-related issues, is now shying away from having their leaders be accountable. There are very serious allegations against Mr Arun Jaitley, the Finance Minister of the country and still the patron-in-chief of the DDCA, but not once has the BJP said that the allegations against him should be investigated by a neutral agency; it is busy instead giving him a clean chit. They are hiding behind the report on the DDCA of the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) which is again a half-truth.
The report was submitted recently and the BJP says it has not indicted Mr Jaitley or mentioned him even once - but the party hides two facts from the public domain: this report was only for 2012-13 and not for 1999 to 2013 when Mr Jaitley was President of the DDCA. Secondly, the SFIO report has indicted the DDCA on 62 counts which highlights the seriousness of the corruption. The BJP has blatantly been ignoring the DDCA fact-finding report and another scathing report by two judges. Mr Jaitley and his party have been saying that he was the Non-Executive President of the DDCA and was not involved in the organisation's day-to-day activities. But the new facts, which I have produced before the media, clearly establish that not only was he directly involved in every matter and did not take actions against the guilty but was also involved in an attempted cover-up of corruption by DDCA officials.
The matter relates to the Syndicate Bank Club. There was an illegal attempt to usurp this club by a few senior DDCA officials by fraudulently trying to convert an institutional club into a private club. A complaint was made to the police in 2010. The Delhi Police initiated an investigation. On October 27 2011, Mr Jaitley wrote a letter to Delhi Police Commissioner BK Gupta, asking him to close the matter as the DDCA had done no wrong. Apparently, this letter cut no ice with the Police Commissioner. After a few months, another letter lands up at the table of the Special Commissioner, Ranjit Narain, who was supervising the investigation in this matter. This letter was written on May 5, 2012 and was again written by Mr Jaitley. In this letter, Mr Jaitley complains about DDCA officials being questioned and says that this questioning was harassment. Then he concludes that the matter be closed as no wrong was done by the DDCA.
This letter was a serious interference in an ongoing investigation and was an attempt to pressure police officials to close the matter which is an offence in the eyes of the law. But Arun Jaitley is not an ordinary person. When he wrote that letter, he was Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, which is a constitutional position. Mr Jaitley had been a member of the parliament for long. He was also Law Minister in the Vajpayee government. Before that, he had served as Solicitor General when VP Singh was Prime Minister and his party was supporting the government from the outside from 1989 to 1991. He is also an eminent lawyer who commands respect for his legal knowledge. A person of such repute knows very well what he was doing when he was writing those letters. He can't pretend to be ignorant of the law.
The entire country knows that Mr Jaitley has been a very powerful man in Indian politics for the last two decades. It's immaterial whether he is in government or not. He and his words carry a lot of weight. To close an investigation is not a right which Mr Jaitley can exercise despite holding a constitutional position. That prerogative lies with investigative agencies and courts have to endorse their action. So when he suggested to the Delhi police that they close the matter, he was basically asking them not to investigate any further and give a clean chit to all those who had indulged in corrupt practices- which is, of course, criminal.
As Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, a post of cabinet rank, he is duty-bound to protect the law and if he is willingly doing something which can be construed as interference in the execution of the law, then it is far more serious an offence. He can't take refuge in the argument that he was writing those letters as President of the DDCA, not as Leader of the Opposition. I would have appreciated it if he had written to the police asking them to investigate the matter in a free and fair manner and prosecute those who are found guilty, but he did the opposite.
Now the DDCA scam is in the public domain. The CBI has registered a preliminary inquiry. More than two dozen complaints are pending with the Delhi Police in this scam. Mr Jaitley is the Finance Minister. The Delhi Police and the CBI report to his government in the Centre. He tried to scuttle the investigation and save the corrupt in the DDCA when he was in the opposition, so it is easy to guess the fate of the investigation when he is a very powerful minister. One can infer that he is influential enough to not let the matter reach its logical conclusion.
May I remind Mr Jaitley what he had said about Manmohan Singh that Caesar's wife should be above suspicion? Mr Jaitley, why don't you follow what you preached to the then Prime Minister? Resign, Mr Minister!(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            So Jaitley will resign as the officer under him were corrupt though there is not evidence to indict him. That sounds fine. Will Kejriwal resign for Tomar, Somnath Bharti or his PS? Both should happen

You have 2 seats in the Lok Sabha and you guys behave as though you're the main opposition party. Work in Delhi...PROVE yourself.. and again I say as a Delhite, PROVE yourself before you point fingers at others. You say practice before you preach? (which you dont do yourself) I say people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones at others.

What are doing about the looting by your party MLA'S in name of high high salaries, if they thought the salary for public service was low they should not have fought the elections.

                            Not a single day passes without AAP accusing center. AAP has become hyper aggressive against the Modi government after the CBI raids. If AAP is serious about corruption in DDCA it can approach court and have a court monitored probe as done by Swamy. While the malpractices in DDCA is widely acknowledged, trying to malign someone without concrete evidence is nothing more than a farce. It is highly suspicious the way AAP has shown urgency in setting up a probe that too headed by a person who is not in good terms with center. AAP is also trying to hoodwink people by trying to setup probe agencies that are constitutionally invalid. Its time these folks spend more time governing Delhi than spending time in media. AAP needs to learn from other states which are not governed my NDA. There are imminent tensions between center and state especially if they are from two different parties but managing this delicate balance is something AAP should learn. They are yet to complete their first year. This confrontational attitude will do more harm to AAP and delhi than center.

                            From this article i understand Jaitley has written leeters to commissioner. The point being missed by AAp and Ashutosh is first letter was written after 1 year of investigation and 2nd letter again after 1 year. The benefit of doubt goes to Jaitley as he might written to highlight repeated questioning of Police with no substantiate evidence.  Had he written continuously we can understand he is putting pressure. <br/><br/>
However any layman can say there are scams in DDCA and beyond doubt every cricket association. Question to AAp why this selective target and why this public trial. Its better to file a case and fight rather than putting drama daily.

                            Correct 100%. Infact who lost their Loksabha seat ( like Arun Jaitley) and became central cabinet ministers , should be stepped down. Smiriti Irani is also one of them. Totally RSS sponsored ministers making mockery on our intitutions. Saviour sit Laligate &amp; Vysppam cases.That is why Parliament not working Modiji.

                            Ashutosh is the biggest disappointment ever. From being a A star journalist to a SIDEKICK of kejriwal. He has dropped many levels and i still dont understand .. FOR what? May god give him some intelligence and positive thought process so he understands that the biggest mistake in indian politics is ARVIND KEJRIWAL and he is the only one who should resign as he has made life of delhites worst. From water coming at 4am to odd even to no law and order to corruption to negativity to getting unauthorized colonies created at the fastest pace ever by getting 10,000 people from UP, Bihar and other poor states just to make them beg on the roads and use them as vote bank.I AM TRULY ASHAMED OF VOTING FOR KEJRIWAL AND I WISH TO HAVE PREZ RULE NOW INSTEAD OF HIM.

AAP has come to the power by accident, although you have no quality to run the Delhi state. Hence, now we have to tolerate you and other bunch of jokers for next 4 years.<br/><br/>
Therefor, you should not fly in the air and be in your limit. Fundamental right to express does not mean talk all insensible all the time and ask resignation of anybody any time like F.M. or abuse the P.M.<br/><br/>
This is really shameful on your part. You are insulting the central government now and then, who has come after big mandate from the country in 2014

                            Had Jaichand not helped Ghori, history of India could have been different. Despite having a very large numbered  military, Siraj-Ud-Daula was defeated in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 as his army didn't support him at the battleground because of Mir jafar. The traitors like Zamindars and worthless Maharajas were a main reason for the unsuccessful first war of independence in 1857. If Kejriwal is a patriot then the first thing he should have done is to take action on the corruption charges he had levelled during the 2013 Assembly election

                            Whether AAP did fraud or not is a separate issue. Why are so many comments here tying this fraud with AAP and saying if Jaitley resigns, so should so and so.  This is why we have accumulated frauds in this nation.  This article is about the fraud committed by the finance minister of the country ---and if he has any shame he should resign. When a train crashed in 1960s, the then railway minister Lal Bahadur Shastri resigned on moral grounds, even though he was not personally responsible for the tragedy. Today's minister have diffrent ethical standards and are clearly shameless.
