Headline::::Delhi Has Enjoyed Humiliating the BJP



DateTime::::2015-02-10T23:23:00+05:30



(Delhi-based columnist and author Sunil Sethi writes a column for Business Standard and hosted NDTV's literary show - Just Books - for 9 years.)  
	                                
	I stopped by at our popular halwai at a South Delhi market to buy gulab jamuns for a family lunch on Sunday, and overheard the shop keeper on his cell phone giving his prediction on the election result. "Ab kal dekhna kya hoga," he was saying, "Dilli saare desh ko hila degi"---Wait and see what happens tomorrow...Delhi is going to shake the nation. As it turned out, he was spot on, and clearly a fervent Aap Aadmi Party fan.
	 
	He is the archetype of the "muffler man"---comfy jersey, shapeless pants and brimming with confidence, though I doubt if, like his leader Arvind Kejriwal, he took the afternoon off to "chill"  go to see a movie called "Baby".
	 
	I tried to engage him in conversation, pointing out that shop owners like him are regarded as part of the BJP's traditional voter base in the city, so why the change of heart? "Don't forget," he pointed out, all smiles, "Kejriwal belongs to our community; he's a bania like us." On the basis of caste loyalty, though, he was only partly right. Not just the city's trading community but all shades of political persuasion - cutting across caste and class - came out in overwhelming support of AAP, in one of the biggest landslides the city-state has ever known.
	 
	Polling on Saturday at the local municipal school where I have been voting since the early 1970s was calm and orderly and solid the whole day long. Ours is a mixed neighbourhood with a dense working class area - one of Delhi's numerous lal dora villages - bordering an affluent residential enclave. Voters usually emerge through the day in a trickle, clutching their slips on a leisurely stroll, while the better-off drive up in their sedans and SUVs. But I had seldom seen such long queues. A stylish neighbor in a smart red wool dress could hardly restrain her enthusiasm. "I voted AAP," she exclaimed with unabashed glee. On sartorial grounds alone she is in the genre of Narendra Modi -- someone always dressed upand always on the go. Most likely, she voted for the BJP in May's general election. But this time, she said, she wanted to "show them".
	 
	This sentiment of "let's put the BJP its place" or "bring them down a peg or two" - especially after the party's seemingly unstoppable juggernaut in national and state elections last year - has been a key factor in determining AAP's spectacular triumph.
	 
	Delhi is a complex, problematic, spoilt and demanding place, a city more conscious of the shifting levers of power, more attuned to the antennae of political rumour and gossip,  than anywhere else in the country. It has among the highest per capita incomes, boasts better indicators in education and healthcare, more green cover and bigger spending on arts and culture than any other city. On any given day you can walk into free classical music or jazz concerts in its parks, go ticketless to the Russian ballet or Peking opera, or pay a few rupees to enter the best art shows. Its populace is so accustomed to a "freebie culture" that it expects everything to be heavily subsidised -- including water, power, housing and public transport. It is also a disastrously mismanaged, infernally polluted, traffic-choked and dangerous city. And if you want "Swacch Bharat", then see the large waste dump, opposite the municipal school where I voted on Saturday, turn into a festering mountain of uncollected garbage on weekends when its municipal employees go on the lam.
	Since the election of December 2013 that threw up a hung Assembly, and particularly since last May when the BJP swept the city's seven Lok Sabha seats, things have gone from bad to worse. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his strategic election micro-managers like Amit Shah are perceived as "outsiders", impervious to the capital's mounting stress levels. Kiran Bedi's nth-hour nomination as candidate for chief minister was seen as another instance of the party's arrogance and disinterest; it alienated not only the BJP's strong ground-level cadre, but further disillusioned Delhi's disgruntled voter. Bedi's half-hearted campaign was also rendered "voiceless" on account of her perpetually sore throat. When she did manage to utter, what fell from her mouth were either platitudes of Modi-worship or silly jibes against Arvind Kejriwal that he adroitly turned into sympathy for the striving underdog. That she lost from Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, former stronghold of BJP's best-known local leader, Dr Harsh Vardhan, now a Union minister, underscores the degree of schadenfreude prevailing in the constituency: it derived malicious pleasure in ensuring her humiliating defeat.       
	 
	One of Sheila Dikshit's contributions in 15 years of Congress government was to trifurcate its municipalities, yet they remain hopelessly unwieldy and incompetent. The police force is notoriously corrupt. The Jal Board with its thousands of grace-and-favour employees has been struggling to install automated water meters and computerize its records but - on the evidence of a visit I made a couple of weeks ago - failing miserably.
	 
	According to the 2001 census, Delhi recorded the highest number of migrants (5.6 million) after Maharashtra (7.9 million) in a decade. It is this teeming population of new arrivals, growing apace, that form the bedrock of Kejriwal's support base. How will he provide them cheap electricity, water and housing without bankrupting the city's finances is the question to which AAP has no clear answers. It was at the root of the confusion which caused its floundering 49-day government to fail in 2014.
	 
	I walked to the straggly village bazaar that abuts the municipal school just after polling ended on Saturday to collect an electric kettle given for repair and found the polling agents of the three parties tallying voters' lists at their makeshift tables. They presented a study in contrast as they wound down after a day that began at dawn. The BJP stall was the best-manned with smart laptops and a flurry of volunteers on cell phones. The Congress Party table had a group of young men in jeans and sports caps with Rahul Gandhi badges. They were sipping tea and gossiping-with astonishing accuracy-about the festivities lined up for Amit Shah's son's wedding in Ahmedabad today. "BJP ka band bajega aur baraat bhi," one of them sneered.
	 
	The AAP stall had just two earnest men, modestly attired in kurta pyjamas and AAP khadi caps, diligently ticking lists with ball points. They patiently explained their system of volunteering and door-to-door campaign which they had been carrying out since December. With quiet assurance, one said that he was certain that "all the poor people" - the working class of car mechanics, shopkeepers and household helps who live in the area - had voted for AAP.
	 
	At the electrician's, the TV set was turned up loud, and the afternoon's exit polls predicting a victory for AAP were being avidly discussed among shop owner and customers. When I reminded them of the public anger that followed Arvind Kejriwal's ignominious exit as chief minister 13 months ago, they were unexpectedly magnanimous. "Woh purani baat hai," said the electrician cheerfully. "Ek baar Kejriwal ko phir chance do. Sabse bari baat hai usne public se galti ki maafi mangi hai (That's an old story. Let's give Kejriwal another chance. The main point is that he's apologized to the public for his mistake)".
	 
	Most customers nodded in agreement. Arvind Kejriwal's sincere public apologies have warmed Delhi's heart and swung the vote for AAP. The BJP's overreaching authority and swagger has caused its comeuppance.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Blog is good. It explains to the rest of the nation how immature, selfish and foolish the voters of Delhi are. Just to "enjoy" defeating the PM and for freebies and minority agenda they have not minded stalling the nation's progress! This is a very unhealthy trend and rest of the nation should learn to safeguard and keep the nation's best interests at heart.

                            The PEOPLE of DELHI have been living off rest of India from time immemorial. During olden times (Delhi Sultanate, Mughal and even British time) the rulers LOOTED from rest of India to sustain GOOD LIFE in Delhi. When Mr Kejriwal promised FREE EVERYTHING to DELHI VOTERS they voted overwhelmingly for AAP hoping to LIVING OFF THE TAX PAID BY REST of INDIA and GRABBING Water, electricity Etc from neighbouring states while the PEOPLE of these states suffer deficiency. ........... There is an over all POWER and WATER SHORTAGE in India and DELHI only interested in snatching resources...Sad

                            Strange enough, a loss of nearly 1% of votes for BJP w.r.t. 2013 assembly election resulted in washout of the BJP. Its Congress Mukt Bharat dream has moved one step further. But the congress mukt dehli resulted in 2-corner fight resulting all congress vote shifting to AAP. I wonder what if Congress Mukt Bharat becomes a reality? Will it wipe out the BJP from the national scene, because on an average it has got only 30% national vote share. All votes consolidating against it will clearly make  Congress Mukt and BJP Mukt Bharat. But the biggest question is who fills the vacuum. Can AAP take the place?

                            Mr. Sunil, I dont think so. The differrence of  % of voters in 2014 and 2015 Delhi election for BJP is a meagre 1%. Delhites didnot vote against BJP. They voted against Congress and all the chunnu-munnu parties out. I think the first victory is not a mere calculation of continuos victory. They have to prove for second, third and on.

                            Did you not read the election results that showed 33% people voted for BJP and it was Congress who lost badly.   It was humiliating for Congress who has just become irrelevant in Indian especially Delhi politics after ruling in Delhi for 15 years straight. At least educated people should provide the right analysis based on the facts and figures.

                            BJP attacked Kejriwal for being a "bhagoda". Kejriwal promptly "apologized". I put the quote-marks because it was not a real apology, for that would have "I was auditioning for PM-ship because that's what I wanted, I used my time in the government to primarily get into the national conversation, I jettisoned the government strategically to pursue my ambitions for being a PM, I spread my resources too thin, and I am back now to my old job".

                            foolish people have not understood what modi had said regarding 15lacs. who had told the amount of black money is so huge that every one can get 15lacs. It does not mean that he will credit 15lac to all account. Surprised even so called opposition leaders are claiming the same. One thing is certain,what he had said that those who are paying income tax will be given 5% benefit(rebate) once black money is received back. Now God only has to save Delhi if he is there.<br/>
Fisrt Modi has to kick out Sakshi Maharaj, Avaidhyanath and some sadhu minister. Other wise he whatever good he does to country it will be clouded over by these people.

                            Democracy doesnot mean to protect interest of rich businessman and industralist in the pretex of economy stimulus. Government has to treat every citizen equal whether farmers, workers, traders, industrialist and businessman. But BJP has only agenda of one class of society to protect interest of rich people. <br/>
For poor and needy people BJP oppose subsidy but they want subsidy and subsidised mechanism to benefit rich industralist and businessman by grabbing land of farmers in the pretex of development agenda which is favaratism and nepotism and croni capitalism.

                            Dear Delhities, I voted for Modi in May &amp; Feb as well, the mandate is now with AAP to deliver &amp; ensure no more Govt. Changes &amp; dharnas take place.  As far as Delhi is concerned, majority of the voters esp. from low income group, minorities etc. have heavily voted in favour of AAP which used to be a Congress bastion earlier.  Secondly, my biggest fear is the Subsidy culture, Delhi has the highest Per Capita Income and the lowest level of tax payment compared to Mumbai &amp; still we need subsidies. My Driver from Gujjar community has land worth 8-10crores esp from the so called Villages getting tax free money in form of rentals from poor labrourers/daily wagers in tune of 50-60k, how are they poor &amp; why subsidies to be given?  Thirdly, Water &amp; Power are a resource we have in scarce, ask normal Gujrati he's not been given any such subsidy in Gujrat but yes 24x7 power &amp; water supply across Gujrat and state machinery as effective as an Private organization....this is what we all deserve I guess

                            brilliantly said GI. For a lot of media personalities too who have also been part of a freebie culture of grants &amp; gratis and favors, the BJP with its no nonsense approach in keeping media at arms length has been a big shock."So the Lets show them" quote is more a media sentiment than the common man's.After all 32% still voted for the BJP. <br/><br/>
And for many who have been lining their pockets for decades, bureaucrats ,babus ,corrupt clerks enjoying lazy weekends and even lazier weekday afternoons, a decent days  work was anathema and the BJP with biometric attendance and no basking in the sunshine during  working hours ,was like drinking poison. No wonder the BJP was not let in to ruin their acche din.

                            Delhi voters claim that they are not gullible and cannot be fooled is a fallacy. Because this is what has exactly happened. It seems as if freebies are a way of life for the Delhiites. Kejriwal judged this perfectly and announced a potful of freebies knowing that the Delhi voter will fall for it. And he was right. This shows that Kejriwal thinks that Delhiites like to live off others hard earned money (tax payers money will be utilised to give free EVERYTHING) and also that it is super easy to fool them. The trick is to only utter the word FREE.

Its a daunting and uphill task for APP to fulfill the basic needs like 24 hrs power supply with 50% reduction in electric bill and providing 20K liters of water for free every month as published in AAP's manifesto.<br/><br/>
Now Kejri will understand how difficult will it be to full fill all the false promises made to people of Delhi as they have been fooled very badly.

                            Most of Delhites could NOT have enjoyed Humiliating BJP, coz such feeling will come to people who have "Sense of belonging". AAP has been voted to power yesterday and to-day in any &amp; all interview, Delhites from Street dancer to Shop walla to mid &amp; higher income wallas in Hondas &amp; Mercedes, consistently been saying "That CHAYIYE &amp; This CHAYIYE". Typical of Delhi, only taking and NO giving. BJP proved their caliber,both by retaining their vote share of 33% in tact and as well NOT to succumb to demands of Delhites of feeding them, whether legitimate or NOT. Next election, in addition to other "freebies",  AAP will arrange for "free supplies" of ONE Pack of Halwai from South Delhi to every  voter and TWO PACKS for Mr. Sunil Sethi, to remain in power. AAP and learned Jurnos will accept that, intention of giving "freebies, including Halwai", in ONLY to improve manufacturing performance, which result in better GDP !!! God save India from philosophy Delhites.

At least we stand for the nation, foolish people of Delhi even sell out for freebies and minority agenda. Fellow Indians make sure your tax money is not going to this state that does not care for the nation's progress. All these years you never bothered about the khangress government's performance, now in so little period you remembered these issues and insulting the PM of the nation. This is not a win for Mango man but for vote bank and populism strategy.

                            It is high time BJP should start supporting AAP in all its endeavor and build a good partnership. Also AAP should distance itself from pseudo secular forces like Congress, JDU, SP, Trinamool Congress etc. It has a good image and the more it keeps distance from them the more AAP will gain strength. <br/>
Best example is BJP itself which is getting spoiled by RSS, VHP etc. <br/>
Choose your friend properly else the image you have gained will be lost in no time.<br/>
All the best to AAP and BJP.

                            You can do a 10 page analysis but matter of the fact is that BJP did not lose its vote share of 31%, niether did BJP gain any. AAP did not lose its share of 30% neither did it gain any.It was en bloc shifting of congress plus 'other's vote of 21% to Aap as this bloc wanted to stop BJP.BJP's failure is that it did not increase its vote share neither it stopped the shifting of opponent vote. But its OK. BJP just needs to ensure that there are at least two parties in its opposition in any election.AAPS RISE WILL ACTUALLY HELP BJP IN LONG TERM.AAP IS NOT GOING TO BE THE MAIN OPPOSITION A SINGLE OPPOSITION IN CENTRE OR IN OTHER STATES BECAUSE REGIONAL PARTIES ARE STRONG THERE,ITS APPEAL IS GOING TO GO DOWN WITHIN MONTHS OF COMING INTO THE OFFICE, AS DELHI PROBLEMS ARE HUGE BUT THERE IS LITTLE IN THE HANDS OF DELHI GOVERNMENT,AND THE PROMISES OF FREE STUFF AAP HAS MADE IS NOT FEASIBLE.No doubt anti BJP people are jumping up down but just wait.

                            Very poor understanding of the ground realities by the writer. Delhi vote this time is a result of all anti-BJP forces combining successfully to chanelise the votes to AAP vote box. Delhi elections being equivalent to a large municipal one, it was easy to manage it. That's why there was a sudden spurt in so-called Church attacks, AAP very cunningly exploiting caste sentiments, appeal from Imam and communal consolidation of Muslim votes, the entire political spectrum from CPM to Mamata and Nitish appealing to vote for AAP, Congress leaving the election battle ground virtually uncontested, and getting its vote share transferred to AAP etc etc. Add to these the promise of freebies from AAP and many in Delhi were sure to lap it up, as accustomed they are to this culture.<br/>
BJP failed miserably to understand this undercurrent, and the response remained unclear and confused. Of course, credit has to be given to AAP for a well organised campaign

                            I think everyone is looking at it from ones own point of view without really looking at facts. It is true that votes of those who were against BJP were consolidated &amp; that resulted in victory for AAP. After all every person has only one vote &amp; people in some groups may come together &amp; decide to vote in one particular way but it is futile to presume that all people came together and decided to vote in particular way.

                            TO all the impatient souls here who talk abt fake promises, I just have one challenge. Make a substantial difference to your own lives in next 9 months and then talk abt false promises. Dumb ppl. Cant take control of their own lives in 9 months and want a Govt. to bring substantial changes in their lives in 9 months.<br/><br/>
And to the fools who talk abt 15 lakhs in their accounts. Did u actually vote for those 15 lakhs? There cant be a greedier SOB than u guys. How could u b so gullible to actually believe it?<br/><br/>
And if you guys r blind, please atleast keep your ears open. There are many policies of the Govt. which are being set right so that during implementation, things become much smoother. For a robust governance, one needs strong policy framework and thats the right way to go abt it. And from the news reports, thats what the central Govt. is doing. As far as the fringe elements creating trouble in the society, these dumb ppl shud b given one island to live on and shud never be allowed to set foot in India. Modi Govt. should have reigned in on them which clearly they r not learning yet. If this continues, they will and should loose other states too.

                            Mr Seth, very poor understanding of dynamics of democracy where voters want to have many options n choices for different positions and same time.

                            Word 'enjoys' points to some sort of sadistic pleasure.Enjoying at the cost of some one' humiliation is not appropriate.The Party has been defeated due to its own weaknesses,there should be no place for enjoyment on its humiliations.In wars too the winning sides salute those who have been run over.

So chil Pil it is election not WAR.. enjoy new goverment and let INDIA move on... If Arvind Perform .. he will be Next PM .. nothing wrong.....

                            Dear Mr. Kejriwal:<br/><br/>
Congratulations on AAP's historic victory.  Most of us were expecting you to win but the number of seats won and the vote share were staggering and least unexpected.<br/><br/>
One hurdle is crossed and the next one is to pick good and right people who will help you to administer.  This is not going to be easy but something that can be done with honesty and transparency.  In whatever your administration does let it be for the good of the people and not for the party.  The people of Delhi have put their faith and trust in you and you must see to it that promises are kept and you offer the people clean and an efficient administration.<br/><br/>
Let honesty and humility be your guiding light as you take office on February 14.<br/><br/>
Wishing you and all the members of your party the very best in the years ahead.

                            People of Delhi will neither get free water nor subsidized electricity.<br/>
If they want to get everything for free, better to settle in village.<br/><br/>
We are living in a modern society, where everyone need to shed blood,sweat and tears to stand on our own feet.<br/><br/>
I really pity AAP for their outdated ideologies. If they generate some fund by curbing corruption, let them use that fund on developmental work.

                            I do not think the votes have any vindictiveness. They are just plain and simple frustrated and their lives have become living hell. They want their lives to be decent. The same is the case pan-India. All in all this article fails to catch the pulse.

                            While congratulating Arvind Kejrival for his stupendous win. Delhi election has seen how all BJP opposition parties ganged up to defeat BJP. Including COngress everyone new that they are going to loose. Here is teh game played that anyway we are going to loose let us ask all our supporters in few % to defeat BJP instead of voting to us. This game by opposition and Kejrivals Humble apology worked better. Delhi voters didn't  realize that they are playing to opposition gang. Arivind Kejrival foreseen how arrogance defeated other parties and cautioned his cadre. But AAP supporters started showing arrogance on tweeter. News media started relating it to many unrelated issues. Mater of the fact is Delhiets gave a golden chance to AAP and AAP has to work in cordial manner with central government to change the system. They shouldn't feel the arrogance that they are only best. Time only tells how they perform. lastly AAP has brought change in mindset of voters and slowly occupying space vacated by Congress

                            LET HIM WHO HAS NOT SINNED , LET HIM THROW THE FIRST STONE! hailed the Bible.  Can Sunil Sethi come upto that standard? Delighting in the misery of others and having a laugh at their discomfiture is a good pastime for the uncouth and  rather scared persons. As the old saying goes' One Swallow does not make a Summer'. So let us wait and watch the days following hereafter. Anyway  politics is getting better and better!.
