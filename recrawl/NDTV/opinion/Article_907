Headline::::How Brand Nitish Defeated Brand Modi



DateTime::::2015-11-09T18:27:00+05:30




                                The BJP's fate in the Bihar elections brings to mind a Bengali word go-hara which means "abject defeat" (literally "defeated like cows"). Given the salience of cows as an election issue by the BJP, the word does acquire an interesting twist in light of its crushing defeat! Did the BJP lose because the Bihari voters rejected cow-politics, or more broadly, all the divisive social issues that BJP harped on - the so-called polarization strategy - and chose instead the good-governance model of Nitish Kumar? Or, is it true as some commentators on the right are lamenting, that the Mahagatbandhan (MGB) has won because Bihar has rejected the development agenda of Narendra Modi for the caste-based politics of Lalu Yadav despite the jungle-raj that is associated with his (and later his wife's) rule of Bihar?
It is quite common for a party, if it wins, to highlight the "good" reasons behind its victory and for the opponents to point out the "bad" reasons for it. If the results went the other way, both sides would very likely have changed their tunes. The MGB would have said that BJP's communal polarization strategy drowned out Nitish Kumar's good governance agenda, and the BJP would have said Modi's development-model triumphed over caste and criminality in politics.
So was it a mainly a contest between the "good" causes - Nitish and Modi's alternative models of development - or that of the "bad" causes like cows versus caste?
The story is complicated by two factors. First, the BJP was the major partner of the coalition headed by Nitish Kumar that ruled Bihar for almost a decade successfully until the break up two years ago. Second, the turnaround in Bihar under Nitish Kumar's leadership is with respect to the poor performance of Lalu's RJD that ruled the state almost continuously for the previous decade and a half.  Even if Nitish Kumar's party did not have enough seats to get a majority in 2010 and does not have it now, there is no question that in the last two elections he was like the star who helps a film to be a hit even though his co-stars may change or in some cases, get more screen time! That may be unfair to Sushil Modi, the Deputy Chief Minister when JDU and BJP were in alliance, or to Lalu Yadav, undoubtedly a major force in the current election campaign, but that's the way it is. Those who are saying the RJD got more seats than JDU are forgetting that Nitish Kumar was firmly projected as the Chief Ministerial candidate all through the campaign by the MGB, in sharp contrast to the BJP which did not project a Chief Ministerial candidate. Nitish Kumar was the brand that was being marketed by the MGB, and the BJP's counter-strategy was the brand of Narendra Modi, undoubtedly the biggest factor behind the BJP's resounding win in last year's national elections.  
If we take the clash of the two brands of Development, Narendra Modi vs Nitish Kumar, what does the experience of the states they ruled tell us? In a study of the growth performance of Gujarat and Bihar under Modi and Nitish Kumar with Sanchari Roy I found that while Gujarat indeed had the highest growth rate of income among Indian states while Modi was Chief Minister, its growth rate relative to India was similar in the decade preceding Modi's rule. In contrast, Bihar's growth rate relative to the rest of the country under Nitish Kumar did indeed significantly change compared to the earlier regime. Therefore, if there was a prize for turnaround of a state's economic fortune, that should have gone to Nitish Kumar, not Modi.
Now, one may argue that it is easier to turn around a state that was at the bottom of the league like Bihar than to maintain, or to marginally improve, the performance of a state already at the top, like Gujarat. After all, there is greater scope for improvement in the former case. Conversely, one could also argue that it is more challenging to turn around a backward state, because if it were easy, someone would have done it already.  
The growth experience of both states, however, raises the question as to what extent the benefits of growth have trickled down to the poorer sections of society. Indeed, if one looks at the Human Development Index for different states, Gujarat is marginally above the Indian average in the decade before and after Modi, even though its growth performance was impressive. The fact that Gujarat's performance in measures of human development is not in line with its rank in terms of the level and growth rate of average incomes has been noted by many, including the 2013 report of the Raghuram Rajan committee. In contrast, while Bihar remains below the Indian average, its rate of improvement was faster over comparable periods.  
This suggests that Nitish Kumar's performance in terms of delivery of social services to the poorer sections - for example, the well-known bicycle programme for girls going to school, improvements in roads and electricity - has been a more inclusive development-model than that of Gujarat. But it was not just the Bihar vs the Gujarat model that was at play in this elections. The voters of Bihar did vote for Modi as PM in last year's elections. Therefore, this is also a reflection of the disappointment that has set in with the Modi government at the Centre. If there was a real economic turnaround after the Modi government came to power in the Centre (as opposed to statistical adjustments of the growth rate) or prices of essentials had come down, the situation may have been different.      
Those who are lamenting that Bihar politics is all about caste miss out two important points. In the national elections in May last year, the BJP-led alliance minus Nitish Kumar won a decisive victory - if those trends were maintained it should have won 172 seats, instead of the measly 58 it received. Was caste not a factor last year? The fact is, the Bihari voter did vote for the BJP last year in the national elections and the "good" cause of Modi's Gujarat model played a big role then.
Also, caste and class are highly correlated in the Indian context. While there is variation within all caste groups, there is no doubt that Dalits, Other Backward Castes, and Adivasis are on average considerably poorer than forward castes as many studies show. There may be genuine grounds for debating the reservation policy in India as I myself have argued earlier, but to dismiss them as a reflection of a traditional caste-oriented outlook ignores the reality of both caste-discrimination and distributional concerns of the poorer sections. It is not accidental that according to preliminary reports, the BJP's loss was particularly heavy in rural areas, where the poorer sections live.
It once again comes back to the question of inclusive development, or sabka saath, sabka vikas. A slogan worth repeating until the cows come home. That is the real lesson of the Bihar elections.(Maitreesh Ghatak is Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics, and his main area of research is development economics.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Pretentious and Fake is what best describes these analysts. Lalu not Nitish is the biggest winner in this election. Bihari People cast their votes by voting their caste. Grand alliance,with better caste equations won.That's all !!

                            Brand lalu with its castiest politics and vote bank politics defeated NDA. Brand Modi is far better then brand Nitish as it is with proven track record in Gujarat. Nitish won mainly because of caste arithmatics, other factors were not so important.

                            Surprised NDTV allows these analysts to publish their views without proof reading the article...<br/>
The Bihari vote for BJP+ in 2014 was 36% with a voter turn out of 56.9% and JDU+ had a total vote share of 45% at that time, however didn't materialise in seats as they were 3 different contestants. With the Union of the 3 they managed to keep their vote share intact and polled a total 43% of the total vote share compared to BJP+ receiving 35%.<br/>
As the BJP has post assessed they failed to break up the votes of the 3 Parties, surprisingly the supporters of the 3 Parties extended their support to the union of parties.

Nitish got fewer votes than in the last elections and he polled fewer votes than Lallu. JDU is a local party in a state that is plagued with caste based politics. Brand Nitish failed miserably despite all that - in fact Nitish took this election back to the dark ages of caste and religion based politics. As far as ramifications at the national level, the country is not filled with buffoons to vote for a coalition of Lallu and Nitish.

                            My take on this election is that Muslim are the real kingmakers as they vote in block. Once Hindu votes are fragmented as happened in this election , Muslims made all the difference. With nearly 20% assured votes, Lalu + Nitish+ Rahul-Sonia has to get only 15% votes from the rest 80% masses.<br/>
In the last general election, Modi could consolidate part of Hindu votes and Lalu / Nitish / Congress cancelled each other's fiefdom, and that's the reason for BJP handsome win.<br/>
The story is no different in Delhi where Muslims voted en-mass for AAP as Congress was not emerging as alternative. They voted for Congress in previous Delhi Election but Hindus voted for AAP and BJP. Since Congress played second fiddle to AAP, they changed over to AAP.<br/>
Watch out for similar happenings in West Bengal where Mamata is going to woo the Muslims to the hilt.<br/>
BJP can come to power only in states where Muslim population is less than 15%.<br/>
BJP has to think of strategies to neutralize Muslim Votes, only then it will have chance to come to power, be it UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Telengana, Kerala, or Assam.<br/>
By consolidating Hindu Votes in Jammu region, it has reached to current position in J&amp;K.<br/>
Question is how to neutralize Muslim Votes or consolidate Hindu votes?

                            It would be foolish to see the Bihar election as Brand Modi vs Brand Nitish. At best it was Development-pro progressive agenda of NDA vs Opportunistic caste-based divisive politics of Mahagathbandhan.<br/><br/>
This election could ONLY be seen as NaMo vs NiKu if only BJP and JDU fought with each other. But that wasn't the case. Yet, if we are hell bent on proving it to be a Modi vs Kumar, JDU with 71 seats wasn't so far head of BJP's 53.<br/><br/>
Yes, NDA lost against the Mahagathbandhan, rightly quoted as Mahaswarthbandhan. But it wasn't loss of Modi to Nitish, rather it was win of low caste dominant Bihar's preference of "Reservation".

                            Those who don't know cast formula in Bihar always try to give their opinion in different ways. Lalu would have never been defeated in Bihar after 1990 had Nitish not joined NDA in 1995 to divide the OBC votes. There is no anti BJP or anti Modi wave in Bihar. It is a tested cast politics of 85% (BC) vs 15% (UC) which used by V P Singh in late 80s. So please don't see these results in different ways. Again 15% are ruling the rest 85% but this time not the upper casts but YADAVs. It is evident from the seats won by this single cast in Bihar in the leadership of Lalu. Lalu used the same politics by abusing UC to appease BCs and linked BJP as a party of UC.

Nitish fate and future is in now squarely in Lalu's hand. Our Caste based politics is as bad as religion based politics.

                            Excellent. Nitish Kumarji being an Engineer has been striving to bring industrialization,innovation and avenues to provide employment in Bihar State.<br/>
He is ahead of other states in encouraging Innovations:<br/>
Nitish Kumar pledges support to small innovations, says will lead to sustained growth<br/>
Sun Feb 02, 2014 | 19:07 IST<br/>
#Patna #Bihar "Calling innovation inevitable for sustained development and transforming the lives of the poor, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has announced opening several innovation centres across the state soon.<br/>
While speaking at the knowledge event of second Bihar Innovation Forum (BIF II), organised by Jeevika with support from World Bank and Bihar government, the Chief Minister said it's important to realise the potential of small-time innovators and put them into practice.<br/>
"Under Jeevika, innovators will not only be recognised, they will be given all possible help so that their ideas can reach and touch other lives," he said.<br/>
His words came after he handed out awards to 32 innovators among 62 finalists who were invited at the forum by BIF (II) to showcase their ideas in front of a independent panel of eminent jurists.<br/><br/>
He stressed on the need for lowering the number of BPL families by means of capacity building for better economic growth of his state.<br/>
"By 2017, our target is to form 10,00,000 Self Help Groups. According to Jeevika, 1.25 lakh SHGs have already been formed. SHGs are helping women in increasing their income. Less educated women are also maintaning accounts now. They are also running PDS shops. They are doing everything that they haven't done before,"he said."<br/>
Energy is the prime mover of any country. Bihar needs energy for economic growth.<br/>
 At this juncture what Bihar needs to propel its growth further is to meet the electricity requirement with a strong political will to do so.<br/>
Bihar has considerable potential for New and Renewable Energy sources, which is yet to be harnessed, the Government of Bihar resolved to issue a revised policy for promotion of power generation from various sources of New and Renewable Energy.<br/>
Bihar's per capita power consumption is 85% lower than the all-India average, while only 26% rural households have electricity<br/>
With 104 million people, India's third-most populous state reported a peak power demand of 3,500 mega watt (MW) in 2014-15, about the same as Mumbai (which has a fifth of Bihar's population).<br/>
The per capita power consumption in Bihar is 144 kilo watt hour (kwh), 85% lower than the all-India average of 927 kwh. Only 26% of rural households are electrified, the worst of any state, IndiaSpend reported earlier.<br/>
It is clear that Bihar cannot meet the rising electricity demands of its people.<br/>
Power deficits fall, Bihar remains energy starved<br/>
The peak demand was 1,800 MW in 2007-08, which increased to 3,500 MW in 2014-15. Peak power availability was 1,244 MW in 2007-08, which increased to 2,831 MW in 2014-15.<br/>
Thermal 2516 MW<br/>
Hydro 129 MW<br/>
Renewables 114 MW<br/>
Source:Central Electricity Authority; Figures in MW; Data as on August 31, 2015<br/>
The installed electricity generation capacity in Bihar was 2,759 MW on August 31, 2015. This is 1% of India's power capacity and 8% of the eastern region (Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Sikkim, Damodar Valley Corporation and Bihar).<br/>
Bihar's power generation is primarily dependent on thermal energy (91%), while hydro and renewables account for only 5% and 4%, respectively.<br/>
Bihar is also challenged by high transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) losses, reported to be 42% in 2013-14 against the Indian average of 27%.<br/>
Financial losses, measured in terms of cost coverage, are as high as 52% for the north Bihar distribution network and 50% for the south Bihar distribution network in 2013-14. <br/>
Bihar has several natural and strategic advantages in terms of its location, climate and geographical conditions. The state has high solar energy potential, which could be the main source of energy for the state in the coming years. Bihar is primarily an agriculturally dominant state therefore it has high potential of producing agricultural residue which could be good raw material for energy production. Also, the state has great potential for small scale hydro power and small scale wind power in the northern parts of the state.<br/>
Renewable Energy Plan for Bihar :<br/>
1.Roof Top PV Solar <br/>
2.Solar Co-operatives on the lines of those in US. <br/>
3.Energy Conservation by replacing most of the inefficient irrigation electric pump sets(About 30% power can be saved). Agriculture consumes much power next only to Industry <br/>
4.Reading lights with reliable and quality dual powered(Solar/Electricity/USB) to save enormous energy. <br/>
5.Biofuel/Biogas for power generation and cooking from Agave/opuntia care-free growth,regenerative and CAM plants. In China Biogas for cooking is supplied trough pipes. <br/>
In the vast vacant land in India Agave and Opuntia can be grown and power generation established as decentralised locally.<br/>
6.KW size Biogas power/cooking plant for villages.<br/>
7.Growing CAM Plants in Waste and Vacant lands which act as Carbon Sink.<br/>

                            I don't think Biharis have done any complicated analysis like this professor here.  Bihar is a backward state still mired in caste politics. People like Lalu who are proud of their backwardness could exploit the situation and win based on caste + communal appeasement arithmetic.  Nitish has lost 44 seats; so where is the question of Nitish vs Modi and Nitish winning. What Nitish and BJP have lost, Lalu and Congress has gained. Bihar and India have lost on the development front because of backward Lalu.

                            All Intolerance issue stopped immediately after election. How. All media created anti modi wave. Nitish had no credits compared to Modi but the entire secular(Communal) media and secular(Communal) parties jointly Projected Modi as communal. BJP does not practice communal not is mature enough to handle communal so congress, AAP and alliance won. It is not Nitish wave. Now crime started in Bihar. Hindus are being forced to convert to Islam, Minor girl gang raped in DM campus but this does not come in news.

                            Congratulations to Nitish and more so over NDTV for its relentless efforts to get BJP defeated . It was a people rejection of the party but we should not underestimate NDTV's campaign to it.<br/><br/>
It is a huge win of Liberals, tolerables and english main stream media than of Nitish.<br/><br/>
You have enough time for UP elections.Take some rest and allow BJP/Modi to concentrate on some core issues. <br/><br/>
You can bring back to the agenda before any elections<br/><br/>

                            Centralization of power doesn't work, in politics or public life  it's equal to dictatorship. Modi should work as a PM and leave the party work to party president and other office bearers. There should be mutual respect between PM, ministers and party workers.

                            Just shut up. You should have written this before the elections, not after the results have been declared. Anyone can whip up a article after elections. It's good journalism if you speak to local people, gather credible data and analyse who will win.

                            Fact is that MGB had the best track record in the form of Nitish and also had parity in terms of caste(remember BJP also had dalits, kushwahas, paswans apart from BJP hindu core vote). The caste combinations of both BJP and MGB were on par with each other, but the brand of Nitish(which is improving) won the day against brand of modi

                            Are you insane or you are misleading?<br/>
Growing Gujarat at 12% yoy was significantly different and much harder than Bihar at 12%.<br/>
If we magnify and dramatize the difference with apology to Biharis, Sweden's growth at 12% yoy would be much more difficult to achieve than Haiti's.

                            Poor performance by allies of BJP and lack of strong state leader, not projecting CM candidate are key factors which impacted NDA/BJP
