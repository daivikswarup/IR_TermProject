Headline::::On My 'Praise' for PM Modi



DateTime::::2015-07-28T20:17:00+05:30




                                One of the things the 20th century is supposed to have taught us is that few things in life are black and white, that much of human reality involves complex alternating shades of grey. The one field, however, that is exempt from this simple principle is Indian politics. Our political life and discourse are the last refuge of Manichaeism, the doctrine that divided the world into mutually incompatible ideas of good and evil.
Consider the evidence from last week. I found myself launching and discussing a book by the scholar and columnist Raja Mohan, "Modi's World", on the NDA government's foreign policy. Since what was expected was an overall assessment, I began by crediting the Prime Minister for the personal energy he has brought to the conduct of policy, with his wide-ranging travels which had made a positive impression on the countries receiving him, and for having leveraged India's soft power as an instrument of our diplomacy through such initiatives as International Yoga Day - though I qualified that by observing that the pursuit of the Guinness Book of World Records was unnecessarily tacky and unworthy of a government. I then went on to point out that the Modi Government had not only continued the foreign policy of the UPA, but done so by reversing most of the BJP's positions in Opposition on issues ranging from the Indo-US nuclear deal to the Bangladesh Land Boundary Agreement. 
Even the emphasis on economic diplomacy with which the Prime Minister was being credited, I said, was nothing more than the implementation of what I have dubbed the Manmohan Doctrine, which posits that the overriding objective of Indian foreign policy is the economic transformation and development of India. I added, for good measure, that where the Modi Government had departed from its predecessor, it had embarrassed itself and the nation - pointing, in detail, to the yo-yo-like pendulum swings of our policy pronouncements and actions on Pakistan and Israel.
It was, in other words, a nuanced analysis, mixed but far more critical than laudatory, as anyone present in the audience (or a glance at the video - where I start at 5:50 and go on for eight minutes). What I wasn't prepared for was the slew of "Tharoor praises Modi again" headlines that promptly followed my remarks. "Tharoor sings Modi's tune again, says he's leaving 'positive impression'", declared ANI. "PM leaves 'positive impression' during foreign visits: Tharoor", echoed PTI. "Modi's 'Personal Energy' Brought New Dimension to Diplomatic Relations: Tharoor", announced Outlook. There were several more in similar vein, all omitting the 80% of my speech that fell short of praise. It was as if all I had done that evening was to applaud Mr Modi. There were a couple of exceptions - one headlined a "sharp debate on Modi's Foreign Policy" and another declared "Tharoor slams 'yo yo' on Pakistan." But these more accurate, if still partial, stories got far less traction; accuracy isn't saleable in the world of political news.
The reason is clear: our politics is not supposed to be nuanced. Our media sees every debate in the binary terms made famous by George W. Bush: "are you with us or against us?" (It is said, apocryphally, that when asked this question by former US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, Nehruji replied: "Yes".) Our media analysis admits of no other possibilities: one must be either for Modi, or against Modi; seeing 20% worth praising, 60% worth criticising and 20% neither-good-nor-bad in his statements and policies is too complicated for our scribes and analysts to digest. Even the Wire and the IANS the more balanced stories referred to above fell into the same trap; where other journalists had reported only my praise, these outlets had room only for my criticism. Whereas I had admitted some positives before weighing in strongly on the shortcomings of Mr Modi's foreign policy, readers of the news would only think that I had "again" praised him or attacked him - nothing in between.
The problem became more acute a few days later when Prime Minister Modi was kind enough to speak positively at a public forum about a speech of mine in Oxford that had "gone viral". Immediately speculation began that I must be about to switch sides; indeed television anchors asked me if I was about to do so. I pointed out that I had thirty years of published work at odds with what Mr Modi and his party stood for, but that was irrelevant to the commentators: the Prime Minister had praised me, so that must mean I was on his side.
There's something terribly wrong with this picture. Why shouldn't our politics allow for mutual expressions of respect across the political divide? Why shouldn't we be able to see or hear the good things said or done by those we fundamentally disagree with and oppose? Nehruji was remarkably cordial to, and respectful of, the Opposition parliamentarians who routinely savaged him and his policies, and even took criticism on the chin from some of his own Party MPs. One could disagree with a party's ideology, worldview or policies as a whole, but find common ground with it on some things. But we have reduced our politics to black and white today: either for or against, nothing in between. "Fifty Shades of Grey" could never be the title of a book about Indian politics.
This view of our politics, reinforced daily by the reports in our media, vitiates our political discourse. It reduces democracy to a zero-sum game where everything done by one side is automatically bad and unacceptable to the other. It explains the destructive Opposition politics of the last ten years, when the BJP ferociously opposed even policies it had itself worked for, merely because they were being implemented by the UPA. It precludes the possibility of fair-minded debate and prevents the public from seeing our politicians as well-rounded human beings with minds of their own. Instead, everyone is reduced to a stock caricature, defined in absolute terms by their party affiliation alone. 
This is a disservice to our democracy - which, as Amartya Sen has pointed out, is supposed to be a process of deliberative reasoning, resulting in the best outcomes for the nation as a whole. Democracy is supposed to be an ongoing process, one in which there must be give-and-take, dialogue and compromise among differing interests. Let us not reduce it to a game of kabbadi. Though unlike kabaddi, don't hold your breath expecting the score to change.(Dr Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Sad state of affairs, considering that Indians have historically been known for encouraging healthy discourses on public affairs. The media seems to have drawn inspiration from the saleability of Western pulp media, however they have to realise the extent of their influence on public opinion.

                            Tamil Nadu politicians should learn this magnanimity of Sashi to praise or criticize the opponent politicians. Always a good gesture to appreciate the good deeds of the opponent . I am afraid Sonia/ Rahul wont be in a mood to accept Sashi's praise for Modi.

                            Its this particular ability to differentiate between the various shades and opine on any issue genuinely that must be displayed by our elected representatives. Moreover this is a quality we should be promoting in all our schools at primary level. This also should be the rationale behind any debate - not to choose one side and keep defending it, rather put your points and bring out the best from all sides of the argument.

                            You are right - upto the last 2 paras- where you mention about the disruption of parliament for 10 years by BJP. Did you really mean 10 years - last 3 years may be more appropriate. I feel by that time BJP concluded (wrongly though) UPA II had lost morally to be in Govt. This was not because of the scams alone but also due to the 'cash for votes' which happended in the fag end of UPA I. And further, UPA II was scheming its revival in the fag end of UPA II with vote catching populist schemes just to stay in power without having a iota of guilt that they may be detrimental for the country in the long run.

                            People read media based on headline. People comment on news based on the given picture. People debate based on their party interest and they don't bother about true or false. People are selfish and they don't care about our country. But if you are a hero then you will be appreciated, here is why, VP Singh former prime minister died on the same day when terrorists attacked Mumbai and he didn't get any media coverage, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam died on the same day when terrorists attacked Punchab and media forced to cover about Dr APJ. Keep your good knowledge to develop our country Dr Tharoor.

                            I agree completely with what is written here. <br/><br/>
Media is always playing the mischief monger nowadays - there have been enough of instances where they selectively quote or present news to deliberately create a controversy. I guess India has the maximum 24X7 news channels and they have to be noisy to stay relevant &amp; more importantly, profitable. I think what's needed is strong defamation laws like they have abroad. When a channel has to pay millions in legal cases, responsibility will automatically come in reporting. <br/><br/>
Also, agree about politics. Irrespective of parties, their behaviour is same when they are in government or opposition. Like now, Congress is opposing everything BJP is doing. In 2019, Congress comes back to power they will do what BJP is doing for development and BJP will oppose everything!<br/><br/>
We also need to understand that foreign policy of any country is country specific. It has to be Indian foreign policy. We, as Tharoor also put it, talk in terms of Congress policy or BJP policy. Or we say Manmohan or Modi policy. That is why we fail. If today Modi is going around the world talking of ease of doing business in India then in 2019 Congress will have to continue that policy but ego will probably make them tighten some nuts just to show to the world that a new govt in place. That is where we fail. <br/><br/>
BJP opposed every policy of UPA and now UPA is doing the same. Question is who will show maturity first? Who will decide whats best for the country over their party first?

                            Tharoor is unfit for Indian politics. He expects that Indian democracy will follow the Westminister style of dignified politics. Totally wrong. We follow the village chaupal style of politics transposed on to the Parliamentary system. We are masters of innovation, and why should our politics be any different? Tharoor should learn Jugaad politics. Then only will he survive. Otherwise better quit politics. Indian politics is exemplified by Laloo, not Nehru.

                            Mr.Tharoor, why r u forgetting the fact that during 2004 - 2014 not even once did any BJP member praise the UPA. Okay, forget about praising the UPA, what the BJP did as the principal opposition party was a blot on the Indian democracy for it played the role of the most destructionist opposition party in Indian political history.<br/>
BJP, during 2004-2014, wiped out an entire session of lok sabha just on one issue. <br/>
So, Mr.Tharoor there is nothing wrong when ur BOSS asks u to disrupt the current parliamentary session. BJP needs to be taught a lesson for its behaviour during 2004 - 2014.

                            It is unfortunate that Mr. Tharoor needs to clarify (to anyone). Our twitter fed and binary minds cannot picture or understand more than a few characters - and lets not even include logic or nuanced perceptions. <br/><br/>
Even in the comments here - people want to jump to a conclusion in an attempt to paint a black and white picture - which the author in his very opening line has tried to dispel. What fortune awaits us as a nation is probably a very unfortunate state - oh wait - we are already there.

                            I wouldn't mind seeing a newly formed party headed by Mr. Tharoor. Congress clearly lacks leadership. BJP clearly lacks the will. And AAP clearly lacks.

                            Dear Mr Tharoor,<br/><br/>
Length of the Write up is an intellectual aggression. Politics in India understands only binary language because of harsh reality of treatment to the controllers  of politics (Ground level workers and hidden financers). These controllers win the elections not the intellectuals like you who write long write ups. <br/><br/>
Areas where elections are won by muscle power, ground workers are either dead or alive after election. Areas where money power dominates the election, hidden financers either gain or loose the black money. Go and check in UP , either you are Yadav or you are not Yadav there is nothing in between.

                            Completely agree! Effective communication, be it constructive criticism or the expression of one's admiration for another's actions/views, is the key here.  It's heartening to see that you 'get it!'. Unfortunate that most others in the current Indian political frame, don't!   P.S.: Fantastic rebuttal at the Oxford debate. Extremely poignant. Very proud!

                            How to 'understand' Television 'news', OR News producers' secret guide to produce content that will keep (uninformed) viewers glued to screen.<br/><br/>
1. Never Be Dull<br/>
2. Embrace willfully ignorant simplicity<br/>
3. Public (and by extension your own viewers) is stupid; treat them that way.<br/>
4. Always ignore the fact and the public record when it's convenient.<br/><br/><br/>
In short, NEVER FORGET THAT - "Television is an emotional medium. It's entertainment, not analysis or reasoned discourse."
