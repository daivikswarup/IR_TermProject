Headline::::Salman Khan Finally Loses Celebrity Cover



DateTime::::2015-05-06T18:26:00+05:30




                                Salman Khan started a line of merchandise whose proceeds were donated to a trust called 'Being Human' almost a decade ago, soon after a case was filed over his SUV running over a group of men sleeping on the pavement outside a bakery in 2002.
The actor was drunk, the court said on Wednesday. The hit-and-run took place as he was on his back at night to his suburban Mumbai residence. The victims, according to some reports, pleaded that he slow down, but the actor apparently ignored what Being Human entails.
It was around the same time that there were allegations of the actor being in touch with the underworld and resorting to violence with the women he was reported to be seeing. Years after the accident, he allegedly gatecrashed the shoot of his then girlfriend's film and abused the actor. His co-actors told the media that he was a spoilt child but "a gem at heart". There were certainly many who praised him for the money he would lavishly donate to crew members on his films who were in a crisis. He had a heart of gold, said supporters and he would spin around the streets of Mumbai with his fans cheering 'Salman bhai.'
In Bandra, outside his residence at the Galaxy Apartments, 'bhai' would emerge in his balcony on festivals like Ganeshotsav and Eid and wave at the sea of fans gathered outside. His female fans would stand outside with placards and roses waiting for salman. Male fans with well-built quadriceps are often found waiting to pose with him for photographs.
In 2004, after he was taken into custody and released on bail, he gave a TV interview wearing a Muslim cap and told the anchor that alcohol was 'haraam' in Islam and he would try to be a good Muslim and quit drinking. 
By sharing this anecdote, one does not wish to pass a moral judgement on Salman or his real or misreported drinking issues, but it's what comes across as one of a series of convenient attempts to approximate morality (along with the charity Being Human) that bothers one. In court today, his lawyers argued that a long jail sentence would mean the actor cannot donate to the trust; there are some reports that the actor gestured to the lawyers against trying to leverage his charity work in their request for a lenient sentence.
As I write, some of Salman's friends from the industry are talking about him paying the price of being a celebrity. Ask them about the first name of the man who was killed, and most are likely to struggle.
Perhaps Salman's well-wishers would want to answer where was his humanity when his driver stepped forward to claim he was at the wheel - a version firmly rejected by the judge today. 
Today, as Salman Khan is convicted of all the charges including culpable homicide and negligent driving under the influence the alcohol, his friends should refrain from blaming the legal system of being harsh on celebrities. For if that was indeed to be the case, Salman should have been sentenced thirteen years ago. 
Spare some time and thoughts for those pavement dwellers - the injured, the family of the man who died - who would have to shell out an extra rupee of their daily livelihood to appear in the court and testify for as long as thirteen years.
If Salman wants to set an example of being human the least he can do is to apologise to the family and face the sentence instead of employing a battery of high profile lawyers who could come up with another alibi.
My friends and I have been lauding the recently released marathi film 'Court' which portrays the ordeal of a poor and powerless man and his tryst with the law. Most of my friends from the industry suggested it should be our entry at the Oscars. Hope my friends agree with my sentiments and that of the middle class in India when we hail the judiciary today in the Salman Khan verdict. Justice delayed but not denied, that's being human!(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer.

For all the morons out there who write in support of this Khan, just think for yourself how the system would have treated you if youu had run over a pavement dweller.<br/>
Then you will realise that Salman Khan actually had a very good deal.

                            Every point you wrote is correct but, how come Court did not come up with "compensation" for the suffering which even the victim is asking for ? The lost life can not be returned and the family which lost one of his member would not be interested in the good work done by Salman (being human). A financial relief by the court could have done good for the victim.

                            Excellent article ! The travesty in India is that it takes 13 years for a criminal case to be impartially investigated and then prosecuted. Spare a thought for those who were killed and injured unlike Bollywood who is blaming the poor for sleeping on pavements! Perhaps they should offer them accommodation in their mansions or raise funds for shelters for the poor in Mumbai.

                            It is interesting to see how many of  his Bollywood colleagues are competing with each other in issuing stupid statements and giving him character certificates. Salman has failed all those who support him unconditionally by trying every trick in the book to escape from the law of the land for 13 long years. Since when did misleading the court and manipulating the system became equal to being human?

                            True. However its also a sad testimony of the criminal-justice system in our country wherein a case with clear evidence as this one needed 13 years to be settled. Forget about what the celebrities say..had Salman been a common man,say a taxy driver, he would have been incarcerated for all the years the trial went on and would have recd max 10 y sentence too!! Thats the power of the celebrity criminal. The day we punish the crime and not the individual behind it we will be a better society.

In India the justice system needs an overhaul to ensure timely justice. Lack of money should not prevent the poor from receiving justice. But a verdict like this, even delayed, gives one hope of better days ahead.

                            Another 10 years in High court, then another 10 years in Supreme court by then Salman will figure out what "Being Human" is being about. Till then homeless footpath dwelling citizenry might have to take little bit of caution and not sleep during night.....for "Being Human" might be in party mood, high on stupidity and low on brain juice might come and butcher them.<br/><br/>
But who is counting, 2,3....or 10 of poor people die. Justice or the mockery takes 10, 20....or 50 years, who cares.

                            Justice delayed is justice denied. Our judiciary is the worst of the lot. Instead of praising them we should sack the judge responsible for holding on to the case for 13 years. It was not enough that a human died our judiciary kills humans every day by delaying justice.

                            Characters like Salman Bhai are our creation. More specifically - our media's creation. As years go by they assume an aura and an air of invincibility. While we cannot stop gushing and sucking up. So who are to be blamed?? Only Salman?? Yes! He has to listen to his inner voice, apologize, not contest the verdict and face the sentence. We - Will we just move on to the next sound byte - as usual - as if nothing happened?? Will this episode just get drowned in the next news cycle?? Is that the price for the lives lost?? If so - we deserve people like Salman. Nothing more. Nothing less. While we need to spare a thought for the victims, more critical need of the hour is we need to rethink about ourselves. Feeling shamed can be a good way to start.

                            Its good that he was punished. But that is thanks to the media which kept the spotlight on the news. Otherwise he would have got away like Nooriya Hawaliwala, Alister Perira and dozens of others who have killed pavement dwellers and got away using money power with no jail tern or six months jail term. They too should have been punished but since the media forgot about them they blatantly cut deals with the police and prosecution and got away.

                            Another malicious article by a salman hater media person. First and foremost, salman has been doing humongous charity work even outside Being Human. Number 2 - salman deposited Rs. 19 lakhs for the victims as directed by the Court.  The court stopped him from giving them any further help for the fear of them getting influenced. No-3 one or two incidences don't take away what he has done for common people as well as industry people all his life. No 4- Reaching out to a friend is not a crime and worrying about salman doesn't mean being happy about somebody's death. Today, even the victims are more interested in money than jail for him and only hypocrites are beating their chests without really stopping to think how will they benefit from Salman's jail term? No 5- This is more about salman than victims or the legal system as this is a golden opportunity for his haters to malign him to their heart's content

                            Finally, something sane. I have been sickened in the absolute trust people have on the PR created version of this man. Just read an article by Manu Joseph which explains that when Salman called Viveck Oberoi called 41 times he used expletives of the worst kind and described how he had sex with all his exs to the poor guy. That is he real deal. That is the real Being Human Khan. Wish I could slap some sense in to the extreme stupidity of Salman fans.

                            My thoughts went straight on that footpath where people were sleeping . The first thing that comes to my mind is why do people sleep on the road . they are poor that I can understand but why not choose a safer place to sleep.<br/>
what is the government of india doing ? Not even a single person has questioned why the government doesn't do anything about people sleeping on the road . I guess the authorities are too busy taking bribes. the government of this country is rotten from inside out. And the rest are celebrating this judgement . What a sad state of affairs..

                            Stop preaching platitudes.It was an accident and every human being would try to save himself. Salman paid the price of being an actor. Nirbhaya rapists still not hanged after intentional brutal rape n murder. Not endorsing what Salman did, but the media/public reaction is plan jealousy and the satisfaction to see Salman suffer. It's just symbolic. May God give strength to Salman. Salman please when you return kick the media out of your life and stop all your charity since people feel even that has an ulterior motive. DO anything with your money, you have a right; it's your blood and sweat, your hard earned money. It hasn't fallen from the sky - which the media and public seems to think so. <br/><br/>
Abha some lady yelling on all TV channels, feels like she's lost her mind. Nothing better to do in life than spreading negativity and hatred. The  victims themselves say all they want is compensation, salman in jail won't help them. One said he even watches Salman movies. No one is worried about victims plight, all only want to see Salman behind bars.

                            Salman Bhai ...just like Russell Peters imitates a China man in his shows  " BE A MAN !!! " Face it ...no point running away from it ...make sure that those affected get financial assistance as well as a livelihood ... BE-ing A hu-MAN will then just follow automatically.... Lot of people look up to you as a role model ..Maybe 90 % of them for your looks and physique and the rest 10 % for the good deeds you have been doing the past years ...but the fact is ,soon the looks and physique will fade away as time goes by ....to ensure that these statistics turn out to be be the other way around as years go by ... Admit the mistake ,say your Sorry to the people you caused pain and hardship and help them , finally abide by the rule of the land and face the punishment . Good Luck &amp; God Bless !

                            Well written, Salman did commit a crime of rash and negligent driving under the influence of alcohol and even though 13 years is a long time but the wheels of justice have delivered and he should be man enough to take it on the chin - no two ways about it.

                            How is it even the judgement debatable ! He should be behind bars! It's astonishing and shameful how his fans can be supportive and  try to justify him taking a life!
