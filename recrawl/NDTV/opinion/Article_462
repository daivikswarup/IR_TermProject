Headline::::Sonia Gandhi, Back in Charge of Congress

	(Ashok Malik is a columnist and writer living in Delhi.)
	Watching Sonia Gandhi leading MPs from 14 parties to Rashtrapati Bhavan and raising slogans against the Bill moved by the Narendra Modi government to amend the Land Acquisition Law, many wondered if the backbone was back in the Congress. Rather than a categorical "yes" or "no", the answer is a cautious and mixed one.
	The Land Acquisition Law drafted by Jairam Ramesh, as UPA Rural Development Minister, and the Sonia-led National Advisory Council was marketed as one of the UPA government's major achievements. True, gaps remained. As is now apparent - following the debate and discussion over the Modi government's proposed amendments - there is widespread recognition that the UPA-era law, in its current form, is unworkable. It will only freeze big infrastructure, industrial and urbanisation projects.
	Indeed, within days of the land law being passed by the previous Lok Sabha, the UPA's Power Minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, had called for an amendment. He wanted ultra-mega power projects exempted from the (then new) Land Acquisition Law.
	Having said that, the law remains central to the Congress' left-of-centre positioning, which is expected to solidify in the coming months. As such, a hard approach to the NDA's Land Bill was always on the cards. It will be difficult for the Congress to compromise here, as it did on the insurance legislation in the past week.
	Sonia's aggression on the Land Acquisition Law also followed twin setbacks on the coal and mining Bills. The Congress had sought to corner the government, but found itself bereft of crucial state-level allies such as the Trinamool Congress. The new laws promise to give a greater share of auction revenues from, for instance, coal mines to state governments. This made parties such as the Trinamool and Biju Janata Dal reluctant to back the obstructionism of the Congress, given the state governments of West Bengal and Odisha would be beneficiaries.
	That is why key regional parties agreed to the government's proposal to send both Bills to select committees - as the Congress had demanded - but committed to getting the select committees to revert with their suggestions to the Rajya Sabha in seven days. In contrast, the select committee on the Insurance Bill had taken several months. The Congress found itself outwitted and its parliamentary leaders were forced to concede to the seven-day time frame. This led to anger among younger MPs, including high-profile names who are expected to be part of Rahul Gandhi's team when he takes over as Congress president. They attacked the Congress' parliamentary leaders for giving the government an easy route.
	Sonia's decision to take charge of the assault on the Land Acquisition Law needs to be seen in this context. It was a response to the growing perception that the Congress was only effective in Parliament (particularly the Rajya Sabha) when parties such as the Trinamool Congress, the CPI(M) and the BJD, and to an extent the Samajwadi Party and the BSP, allowed it to be. When the bulk of these parties opposed and delayed the Insurance Bill, the Congress seemed to have clout. When the bulk of these parties did a deal with the government, the Congress looked lost.
	Two implications flow from this. One, the Congress remains weak, whether inside or outside Parliament, and can only depend on allies and a coalitional road map for medium-term political rehabilitation. Two, this needs to be combined with voices emerging from the Congress that insist Rahul has determined that an even stronger swerve to the left is the only course at the moment. The Land Bill was a useful cause to adopt in this scenario.
	Going forward, two state elections will offer a test of the Congress' strategy for the next four years. In Bihar, an anti-BJP front led by Laloo Yadav is logical, but would require the Congress to accept a very minor position and give up hopes - as demonstrated by Rahul in previous years - of bravely going it alone. In West Bengal, the Congress has been reduced to a handful of constituencies and essentially two districts (Malda and Murshidabad). Party insiders don't rule out appealing to Mamata Banerjee for an alliance - though she is unlikely to oblige, as she has little to gain by keeping the Congress alive in her state - or even reaching a formal understanding with the CPI(M).
	Should it happen, that understanding with the CPI(M) could herald a broader national rapprochement. With Prakash Karat's term as CPI(M) general secretary set to end and Sitaram Yechury expected to succeed him, the hostility between the Congress and CPI(M) - a consequence of Karat withdrawing support to the Manmohan Singh government in 2008 - will abate. Both parties are at a political low, but if the Congress is serious about a left-leaning reinvention it may decide the CPI(M) is the first prop it needs. Marching together, taking along a host of vaguely socialist parties and protesting against the land law would be construed as a useful first step.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Congratualtion Soniaji, atlast to turning to right direction. First UPA won because of NREGA. UPA 2 was lost because of ambivalence and by that lost of core support base. AAP shows how popular support can be mastered by reamaining with the poor and weak.

                            A democracy can only floruish if there is a strong oposition that keeps the rulers honest.<br/><br/>
Not sure if Congress has the acumen to do it.

                            One problem with your analysis Ashok and that is your statement 'voices emerging from the Congress that insist Rahul has determined that an even stronger swerve to the left is the only course at the moment.'  You know and I know and indeed the whole nation knows that Rahul is incapable of determining anything.  He has various flunkies thinking for him, including Jayram Ramesh, Aiyar and Diggy Singh.  In such circumstances Congress has resorted to the tried and tested leadership of Sonia.  Not that it is 'leadership' in the sense that you and I would accept.  It is a system where grown men, educated in the best universities of the world, grovel and pay abject obeisance to a semi-literate Italian waitress.  These are also circumstance in which Sonia will be given free reign and laugh all the way to the Swiss bank!

                            When the 'Diya' (lamp) is about to go, it 'Glows' brightly and then shuts off. The position of Congress is currently like that last 'Glow' ! One can see in next year or two, many Congress related scams, loot etc will be being reviewed by the Law of this land. By the year 2018-2019 the last nail will be driven. They have to account for the last 60 plus years of loot in next couple years. Hopefully,  after 2018 the Nation will be 'Congress Mukt'!

                            Congress moving towards left would be most dangerous to Congress. It will only speed up congress mukta bharat. They should fight alone in all the states. It may not pay dividend in short term but will pay huge dividend in future.

                            Looks like Sonia Gandhi does not want to hand over power to Rahul Gandhi, some kind of cold war going on within congress / Nehru family

                            Strong opposition is a requirement of democracy. But if obstructionist tactics are followed then it becomes a sham. A resurgent Sonia Gandhi is not very good news. There are much capable, intelligent, logical and experienced people in the Congress. With resurgent Sonia Gandhi, the congress will always remain saddled with the Gandhi family which is not very good.

                            My feeling is that Rahul will return to India the day triumphant Dhoni returns. This way his return will not be noticed by the media.

                            How come there were no farmers in the crowd led by sonia gandhi? All looked like land grabbers and promoters of land grabbing? Luckily, rahul gandhi escaped this march led by his mother to "grab" attention and tell the nation that the congress still "existed" and not on the road to extinction.......welfare of farmers? What was the congress doing for 61 years after independence? Does anyone in the ruling party have the guts to ask them? No....they are all hand-in-glove in all crimes.
