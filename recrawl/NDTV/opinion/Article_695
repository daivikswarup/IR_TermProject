Headline::::10 Reasons Why I Believe Aarushi's Parents are Being Framed



DateTime::::2015-07-09T18:30:00+05:30



Journalist Avirook Sen has written "Aarushi", a new book on the murder of 13-year-old Aarushi Talwar, whose parents Rajesh and Nupur have been convicted for murdering her and their domestic help Hemraj in 2008.1.  It is likely that there were more people in the house on the night of the murders according to material I accessed and interviews I conducted. This means the simple math used by the CBI of there were four people in the house, two are dead (Aarushi and Hemraj), so the other two are their killers does not work. But despite having the evidence, the CBI chose not to pursue that line of investigation at all. There are clear indications of the presence of other domestic helpers (who were arrested and then released) in their narco narrations; those who conducted the tests say that what was revealed during the tests does suggest that other people were present.2. Where are the murder weapons? The CBI never seized any of the Talwars' dental equipment that it claims was used to kill Aarushi. In fact, the investigators had no clue what a dental scalpel looked like, leave alone understand what kind of cuts it could inflict; they didn't even bother to buy one to check. As for Rajesh Talwar's golf clubs - the one that had supposedly been 'cleaned' (and was therefore the weapon of offence) was not the one that the prosecution presented in court as the weapon. After having said all along that the Talwars wiped the stains off one club, the prosecutors told the court that it wasn't that club after all, it was another club - one like all the rest, with no evidence of having been wiped clean.3. Witnesses may have been coerced/blackmailed/schooled. The clearest proof of this is in the testimony of  domestic help Bharti Mandal, who worked briefly with the Talwars, where she says she was testifying exactly what was 'explained' to her. In the case of others, like doctors who conducted the post-mortem, and retired policeman KK Gautam who was a key witness for the CBI, there are clear suggestions that there may have been an element of blackmail. The investigating officer in the case had done exactly the same kind of thing in other cases he had handled - and appeared to be valued by the CBI for the ends he achieved.4. The trial judge who convicted the Talwars ignored what was happening and being recorded in his own court. For instance, in his judgment, he attempted to establish the motive of the crimes by saying that Hemraj's pillow and blood were found in Aarushi's room (the theory offered is that the Talwars killed Aarushi and Hemraj after finding them in bed together). But the pillow was in fact recovered from Hemraj's room - a fact that became clear when the actual item was displayed in the trial court before the trial judge.5. The complete disregard for the integrity of forensic evidence: several pieces of evidence were illegally unsealed in this case. The pillow covers, golf clubs, clothing, all of these were compromised. Photographs of the crime scene were also manipulated - some of them showed that events that took place say, on a Friday, were shot by the photographer on Thursday! All this is a matter of public record.6.  The crudely manipulative conduct of the prosecution: once again, this a matter of record and detailed in the book. The CBI invented a macabre e-mail address to send all its official communication to the Talwars, a tactic to intimidate them. It then lied about creating and using this email ID, and of course got caught lying. The defence would often not be told who the prosecution was going to examine on a particular day. The Talwars' lawyers were expected to cross examine even expert witnesses without preparation. When the time came for the defence to produce its witnesses, the CBI said none of the 13 the Talwars wanted to call (against the CBI's 39) were relevant, they would all waste the court's time. In the end the judge allowed 7 defence witnesses.7.  Witnesses were dropped because they would have blown apart the prosecution case. The CBI started with a list of 141 relied-upon witnesses, it stopped at 39. Many of those listed and later dropped had contrary tales to tell about what happened at the crime scene and during the investigation.8. The Talwars weren't given access to critical documents despite High Court orders. In order to assess whether a DNA report had got things right, one needs the details of the tests conducted, or the raw data. The Allahabad High Court quoted British law extensively to say that the defence had the right to this data so that it could approach its own experts. The CBI simply said that it did not have this data, and that the Talwars were only trying to delay the trial by asking for material. The judge agreed with this position. So the Talwars and their lawyers never saw any of the possibly game-changing data.9. Several of the documents submitted to court appear forged: this list is long, and the details are in the book. But among these documents are panchnamas (police documents) into which sentences were inserted; tags of forensic labs that were supposedly official were written out on scraps of paper, these were crude and error-filled. Witnesses' statements have sly inserts in them, and declare they have been read over and signed by the people making the statements when they clearly haven't.10. The unrelenting focus on the conduct of the Talwars. If this was such an open-and-shut case, then why wasn't hard evidence relied upon? Why was it that witnesses were simply brought in to say the Talwars weren't weeping when their daughter was found dead? One of them claimed that he drove 56 km a day for his morning walk all the way to Noida, then visited the crime scene out of curiosity on the morning the murders were discovered. He apparently saw no grief of the parents' face. But what was he doing there? More importantly, was he there at all?Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Apparently all the doors were locked from inside and so only someone from the inside could have done the murder. Many middle class people are uncomfortable with a middle class couple being convicted of murder of their own daughter (they wouldn't care much for the help). If the same incident happened in the house of a poor labourer, these same people would call the labourer guilty even before prosecution.

Can you believe that? Look at what is happening in the Vyapaam scam, the judge heading the SIT has said there is no evidence of foul play in the deaths mindlessly echoing the governments position.

                            When this entire case is sub-judice why do we need an author to write a book trying to prove a doctor couple innocent. What is his vested interest?  I am sure this doctor couple have enough of money and clout to fight their case and dont need an unheard of author to write a story on them.  The author is trying to prove he is better than the court which has spent long hours and days proving this case.  Time we have trust in our legal system and not get carried away by some story which has no legal standing in any court of law.

                            Clearly CBI wants to shut this case by proving Talwars guilty. No body cares to look into the facts, just going by the common perception and framing the most probable. Shame on our judicial system for losing its purpose and sanctity. Shame on us for failing to react and accept things as normal.

                            Personally I cannot rule out the Talwars, that house was like a fortress with 3 doors. The parents were sleeping in an adjacent room. Arushi's door can be unlocked by her or her parents. Everything happened between 12:00 to 1:00 AM and the parents went to bed little earlier. The murder weapons were golf club and surgical instrument (as far as the post-moterm results). The Talwars squarely blaming the murder on Hemraj on the morning of the murder in the presence of the maid (I believe this was done because the police will start searching for Hemraj and when everything is calm, they can dispose Hemraj's body lying in the terrace later.) Rajesh talwars reluctance in handing over the terrace key to the police. Between, the key to the terrace was with Talwars and who could have dumped Hemraj's body in the terrace ? and why was Rajesh Talwar hesitant to hand over the key ?. And what was there urgency shown in cremating the body, if the parents were keen enough to catch the perpetrators ? How did the mobile phones of both Arushi and Hemraj disappeared in thin air. I am not a detective, but I cannot rule out that Talwars in this double murder case.

                            The courts have found the Talwars guilty by using the available evidence. Avirook Sen, whoever he may be, feels that the Talwars were framed based only upon vague theories and suppositions with not a shred of evidence to prove his theories. Of course he would like to sell his book. But the Indian criminal justice system is not the same as paid journalism. Why does Sen not put his views before the concerned courts and find out what they think of him and his views? He might get hauled up for contempt of court.

                            Mr. Sen, <br/>
It is funny that in your seemingly 'intelligent' and 'investigative' piece, you forgot to mention and explain why and how the wi-fi router, which was in Arushi's room was turned on and off after the murder time. I am sure you did not see this fact in the 'public records'. <br/><br/>
Also what kind of mother (who, may I add, knows the importance of forensic evidence being a doctor herself) washes the room before the police arrives. A room where her own daughter was found dead a few hours prior. And it is not surprising then that they kept saying that the investigation was not carried out in a 'scientific' manner. <br/><br/>
And let us not even get into how Mr. Talwar kept screaming Hemraj killed his daughter, kept trying to keep the police away from the blood stained staircase which led to Hemraj's body. Let's not even get into these trivial facts because obviously, this proves nothing.

                            Who are you! If you are a lawyer, go and do arguments, show proofs and if could able to convince the judge then the results would be on your/talwars side.<br/>
If you don't want to go for arguments and wants to give judgements then go by proper procedure, make yourself a judge in the court and if the case would be under you then give your judgment according to you.   Ok! <br/>
This is not the place to decide cases according to your judgment.  You should know that courts are there for this.  Had it possible here then all the cases would have been finalized by their relatives or sympathizers according to their wishes.  Is not it!  But the right thing is they could go to court, not to media.

I don't think any of this could have been the motive behind Arushi's murder.  As per the proceedings in this case I feel there has been a total neglect of scientific facts and  a blatant to coverup inefficiency of the investigative team. It looks even if Talwars couldn't be proven guilty but they still were put in jail but no one has a right to question investigating agencies!!!

                            This case was not proved 100% and no solid evidence. Hence a benefit of doubt should have given clean chit until some concrete evidence is found. If I remember correctly the honorable judge said enough evidence in the closure report to prosecute the parents. Since this was a very much sensationalized in the media, honorable Court had to convict the scapegoats to satisfy large mass of people.

                            I have noticed there is a sudden spurt of release of books, TV discussions etc on the Aarushi-Hemraj murder case. Is the Talwars' appeal against their conviction set to come up for hearing before the High Court shortly?

                            I was really surprised when I read parents like Talwars have been convicted. What is their gain/motive? They are educated and they loved their daughters sincerely.<br/><br/>
I wish for the sake of justice thorough investigations are carried out.

                            The sheer number of pro-Talwar websites, propaganda and publications surprises me. Who are the staunchest supporters of these books and websites? The Talwars themselves. <br/><br/>
Please concentrate on the real cases of injustice happening all around us and stop projecting the Talwars as innocent victims! They are trying to say that the administration, law-enforcement as well as the judiciary are against them.  But why? Why would everyone be against them if there's nothing?

                            The case has been thoroughly adjudicated. Miscarriage of justice is always possible by humans but there is no motive for CBI and the courts to convict Talwars for no reason. Circumstantial evidence yes, innocent maybe not. Only the Talwars know whether they are truly guilty. Honor and shame will prevent them from ever admitting guilt or show remorse. I hope justice has been done and will continue to be done if they are innocent. They now have the time to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. Until then it is a crime of domestic abuse gone wrong. The novice reporter seems to be media trying the case all over again and does not make him more right than the investigating and judiciary systems.

                            CBI is a big dumbo. SC should put that case officer behind bars.

                            The book "Aarushi" by Avirook Sen is an eye opener for all of us. As he concludes the introduction by saying when Indira Gandhi asked Rakesh Sharma how India looks like from up there and Rakesh Sharma gave the memorable answer, "Saare Jahan Se Achccha". This book is about what it looks like from the ground.

                            There has been ample evidence submitted to prove that the Talwars did not kill their daughter as well as Hemraj. In fact the CBI themselves chose to close the case against them - but on the insistence of the courts were forced to manufacture evidence and bear false witnesses to keep it going. Even the CBI prosecutor must have been surprised when the court judgement was given. Makes you wonder what sort of other ridiculousness passes for justice in our hapless nation. Scared for the future generations when trolls and bayers of blood as well as TRPs decide guilt and not due process of law.

                            I do believe parents are 100% innocent. But, i also believe servants are too innocent.<br/>
I think, these murders are related with Aarushi's boyfriend/s.<br/>
It's possible that her friend visit the girl on parent's absence as per report too. <br/>
Servant was aware of that. Girl ditched boyfriend, 15 days prior to that fateful night.<br/>
Heartbroken boyfriend decided to eliminate his love and the witness(servant).<br/>
In some report, parents had objections with girl's relationship. According to Krishna's statement Rajesh looked very much worried, days before murders.

                            CBI should have let parents undoubtedly free and there was every chance for them to do next mistake in near future if they are really guilty. Missed opportunity but i blame a bit on media too for not letting CBI play there cards.
