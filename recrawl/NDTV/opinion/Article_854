Headline::::Why Narendra Modi's Make-in-India is a Mere Slogan



DateTime::::2015-09-28T20:02:00+05:30




                                Today I won't talk about how the rock star Prime Minister made fun of India's secularism in Ireland. I will also not talk about that most atrocious statement he made in Korea, when he said that people regretted being born in India before he became Prime Minister. I have failed to understand whether he makes such statements because he has a bizarre sense of humour or then he seriously believes that he is a miracle-man changing India's destiny.
What I will talk about today is Narendra Modi's Make-in-India project which was launched a year ago and has had no yield.
Make-in-India is a good concept and it was launched with a lot of fanfare to infuse new vitality in the manufacturing sector. It was an attempt to bridge the vital gap between the Chinese and Indian market. It is a known fact that China broke all rules to emerge as a manufacturing giant in the last two decades.
China was a poor country when Deng Xiaoping took the reins of the country. It was struggling with starvation deaths, political uncertainty and a rotten economy. Social unrest was growing and there was a severe power struggle. Deng realised that outdated ideology would not take the country anywhere. He had to be practical. He was one of the oldest colleagues of Chairman Mao, but he was not a prisoner of a dogma or of the past. His genius lay in the prognosis of the ills which had inflicted China as a society.
Deng's first formulation was that if China had to grow, then economic development and political stability had to go together and complement each other. He was far-sighted enough, unlike Mikhail Gorbachev later, to see that the Communist Party of China was the only vehicle which would take the country towards economic development. He said Gorbachev was stupid if he thought that political reform would lead to economic reform.
His second formulation was that China had to start from scratch and it had to admit its mistakes and weaknesses first. Deng was magnanimous enough to underline the fact that China lacked basics - it had no technology and the standards of education were very poor. These two areas were his sole focus in the initial years. Unlike Indian leaders, he did not find the departments of science and technology and education unglamorous. He took these two departments under his wings and made them the engine for future growth. He had no shame in borrowing technology from the US, Europe and Japan. And he encouraged Chinese students to go abroad en masse to the best of foreign universities, acquire quality education and then return and contribute to a national resurgence.
In India, unfortunately, these two departments are most neglected. Since Independence, no minister has wanted charge of the science and technology portfolio. No wonder that despite tall claims, India is way behind in scientific innovation and invention.
Education too has been very shabbily treated by our political establishment. There is no uniform curriculum and the quality is much below international standard. No youngster wants to be a teacher and teaching, with a few exceptions of course, seems to be the last resort as a career choice.
When the Prime Minister launched the Make-in-India project and talked about moving decisively in the field of business and economics, I believed that he would start with basics. He would create an ambience in which development did not mean only physical infrastructure. But to my utter dismay he talked about bullet trains, smart cities and highways. Education was not on the radar. Health was also missing. China built huge highways and invested more than 50% of its GDP in infrastructure development, but it also invested in human capital.
For the success of Make-in-India, foreign investment is a must and to become an investment destination, five components are needed - education, health, infrastructure, safety and justice. But here the order has been reversed. The budgetary allocation in education was reduced - the budget of the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan was cut from Rs. 27,758 crore to Rs. 22,000 crores and the outlay for the Mid Day Meal scheme went down from Rs. 13,214 crore to Rs. 9,236 crore.
As per data available, the budget  for health care and family welfare has been reduced from Rs. 39,000 crore to Rs. 33,000 crore. No attempt has been made to improve the law and order situation across the nation. Huge vacancies are left unfilled in the police and paramilitary forces. Despite a Supreme Court ruling, police reforms are still a distant dream.
Judicial reforms should have been of top priority on Modi's agenda for development. But industrial litigations are taking years to reach any conclusion. Infrastructure development is moving at a snail's pace. On ease-of-doing-business, India is ranked 142 among 189 countries.
The Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi has on the other hand, shown remarkable initiative in this area. Many experts sniggered when Arvind Kejriwal advised the Prime Minister that instead of Make-in-India, "Make India" is the motto the country needs to be a future super power. His argument is simple: unless we create an environment where doing business becomes easy and attractive, foreign investment will not flow.
One can visit the Facebook and Google headquarters many times over and shake hands with Mark Zuckerberg, but things won't improve and Make-in-India will remain a mere slogan.
It is with this thought that the AAP government in its first budget has increased its education outlay by 106% and health by 45%. It has made a plan to build 1000 quality neighbourhood clinics. It has already mapped more than 960 government schools and the effort is to make them at par if not better than any other private school.
The Rs. 10 lakh education loan is another such scheme to improve human capital. Arvind is not a rock star and he does not visit Madison Square Garden to grab eyeballs. But his vision is clear and is not loaded with an opaque understanding of realities.
Mr. Modi, first put your priorities in perspective and get a clear idea; the Zuckerbergs will follow automatically. Then, you won't need to visit them, they will come calling.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Why AAP is just other face of Mahathagbandhan (MAHAGATHBANDHAN)? You need to know the priorities right. For example, Modi is investing a lot on Swachh Bharat - that would bring good health anyways... people won't die because of Dengue! PM's insurance schemes would payoff the medical bill of lots of people. In Europe, everybody gets same treatment because of mandatory health insurance... irrespective how much they earn or contribute for insurance schemes.<br/>
AAP has lot all credibility and just misleading the people.

                            Today, I would like to congratulate Ashutosh for what he has archived. My mother and sister no longer watches Sas, Bahu and Beti Drama thanks to your drama.  You will soon get a call from Ekta Kapoor and you will also join Manishankar Aiyaar where you can actually progress.  You guys have nothing better to do than criticize every single thing Modi Does.  I don't agree with everything Modi does, but it doesn't mean I disagree with everything he says and does.  But I don't know why you two guys are always after him criticizing.  Perhaps, thats how you can stay in news, thats how you can get your blog listed here.  We live in democratic country, where patriotism had disappeared under previous governments rule filled with corruption, mismanagement.  It has been over half of century since independence and we haven't progressed.  What do you expect from Modi?  What anyone couldn't do in 60 plus years, you expect him to do in 2 years?  Shame on you.  Whatever Modi speaks or does, many take a while to get a result, may even fail to apply practically, but at least younger generation is taking interest in politics because of it, patriotism is returning.  And, I am sure regardless of your disagreements on every single thing with him, he will do way better in 5 years than previous leaders had done in 60.  So stop crying at everything, and do your part to govern better. By the way, where is Somu?

                            Yaar, pls stop putting your thoughts in black and white. Irritates ppl to the core. Without reading the full article (it was impossible to read the repeated rambling of this guy), I had to put out a comment.<br/><br/>
At least the guy is trying to get FDI in - what's Khujli doing, apart from trying to negate the positive environment that Modi's creating globally. <br/><br/>
Again, give him some time - FDI has already gone up. Infra, including social infra, doesn't grow on treetops, you need money for the same. Given some of our politicians, including AAP, dole out subsidies, we need foreign funds for infra.<br/><br/>
Don't pls act as a koop Mandook (read frog in a well) and open up your eyes to global Infra funds investing in India!

Now you being cynical all the time and ignore good will. Surat badalney ke liye sirat chahiye hoti hai.. Kam se kam sirat toh dikh rahi hai..

                            A good attempt at trying to cover up AK remarks about make India rather than make in India. Agreed that much work needs to be done to make in India but this cannot be done sitting in India and making grandiose plans with the money to create the infrastructure etc. needed. Therefore attracting foreign investment to set up the infrastructure etc will kick start the manufacturing sector and help it grow over time. It would be foolish to follow your thinking and set up everything in advance and then wait for the Zuckerbergs to come to us.

AK is no more ( or better) than a college union president. Also not to forget about his team including this gentleman...we can add one more slogan "export from India"... I don't have to elaborate what to export from India.

You know what , this is the main problem with us Indians. We are so much tied with pitty politics that we never look somebody beyond this and accept his/her credibility . While entire world has accepted Modi being s great leader with a strong vision and mostly importantly he is doer, it's time for all of us to get away from politics and support him. A PM is like CEO of any corporate and in today's world he/she need to know how to sell or market his/her company, Modi is undoubtly a great person who know this craft well and because of his work, entire world started looking India differently. No PM , yes no one from India did it earlier. So don't stuck into mere politics and raise above to appreciate his work.

(so far only negativity) and start to contribute small. if you have brains think a little bit and see what you can innovate... how you can bring change in the lives of others (not your own bank account)...

                            Dear Ashutosh,<br/><br/>
Please ask Arvind Kejriwal (who is an IITian) to come to Silicon Valley and you will realize where your esteemed leader stands.  I am a person who attended it in person. The most educated and elite crowd of Silicon Valley was enchanting "Modi-Modi".  If AK comes, I would not even like to show up for protest against him though I know how wicked minded politician he is.  Just the fact that you share the same place (Delhi) with him does not make you a national leader.  Your esteemed boss has views on everything whether its relevant or not.  You can go for begging money for party funds, but commenting on Modi's initiative of skill development and Make in India.  He is not asking to manufacture Potato Chips, he is asking for skilled jobs .. but you guys have no skill to understand this.  <br/><br/>
God bless Delhi .. what a clown they have selected to rule over them for 5 years !

                            I'm not saying Health and Education aren't important.But a few things to look at :<br/><br/>
1) India has millions of well educated -well trained individuals who are looking for jobs.Haven't you ever heard of People leaving India for better prospects or PHDs and Masters degree holders applying to work as a Peon.<br/>
2) Please try to understand your government needs money to improve education and healthcare .Also , AAPs ideology of becoming modern day Robin hood by taking from the rich and giving to the poor can only work if government and India makes enough money (simple finance - No rocket science).<br/>
3) 'Make in India' is an excellent initiative.What India needs to achieve it is excellent infrastructure , smooth and red-tape free governance , zero tolerance for corruption .(Yes we do have the man power ,its just a matter of channeling it to the right channel) <br/>
AAP does talk a lot but do not think they are doing in any of these areas , they do talk a lot about zero corruption but sorry to say its all on paper and in Arvind's talks .<br/>
4) Do you understand how hard Modi is trying so India gets an image makeover .Its not a joke to get Facebook CEO talk positive about you and your country.Even if such things do not have an immediate benefit , they do carry a lot of long term benefits.<br/>
5) @AAP/Ashutosh : Please do some good for Delhi before you even think about pointing fingers.As of now, Autowallahas in Delhi behave as if they are above the law .Power cuts in Delhi are horribly bad .Delhi is dirtier than its ever been.No infra projects seem to be moving.Finally , can you please ask Delhi CM to dress up like a CM and not like a bhaiya when he goes to events.He is representing Delhi and should atleast look like he represents the majority middle class(who dress up really well) and not the poor class only (for whom all the AAP policies are created).

If PM believes he can change the destiny - there is nothing wrong in it. At least he has a vision unlike other parties which only has slogans.

                            Mr Ashutosh, Are you nuts? The budgetry allowance to the various Central schemes are reduced because of acceptance of Financial Commission recommendations and increasing the States share to 58% of the total revenue. All left with Central govt was just 42% which was way mush under UPA. Hence all the funds to these although beneficial but not so productive schemes was reduced so as States can spend some part of their increased revenue on these schemes. Also focus was made on Infrastructure, so as it can create more jobs.

Because of  the previous rules, India stands at 140th position out of 180 in ease of doing business and Modi is trying hard to break into top 100. Maybe for you your politics is bigger than the country's future but kindly understand the people are more mature now and they can differentiate between people who are working hard to make this a better place and people for whom their politics is bigger than the country. Shame !

You cannot think that first I will solve some internal issues and then business will follow us. This is the digital age. No one waits for you. If you are not ready business will move on. If you say give me time so i can get ready, business will go. Everything has to improve simultaneously.<br/><br/>
Lastly, China progressed so fast because of one party rule. If you were in China, you would be thrown in jail &amp; executed by now for merely uttering the word DHARNA.

                            @cbrcoder: There are uniformed comments galore on this thread. On the issue of reduction in allocation for education and health in the Union budget, the idiots should know that in this budget, the devolution to states have been increased significantly - from 30% of central revenues to 42% of central revenues which translates to an additional 1.78 lakh crore to the states. The idea is that states know exactly where to spend as opposed to funding from the centre who has no clue on the grass root issues. For instance, a state like Kerala or Tamil Nadu, which have attained high levels of immunisation of children, prefer to spend more money on secondary and tertiary health care (for instance Tamil Nadu is creating capacity for caesarean births in all primary health centres by providing operation theatres), whereas some states will require more money for primary health like vaccination. This is also a reason for states like Delhi to spend more on education and health (not from any great work of the Government of Delhi).

                            Some people are asking where will the money come from for health and education. <br/><br/>
First, a lot can be done via simply removing corrupt officers---this requires action, not money. <br/><br/>
The Delhi AAP government has saved at least 4-5000 crores of money from its anti-corruption initiatives (2000 crores when the electricity companies started making profit suddenly after CAG audit, and 2000 crores in a liquor excise scam exposed within the first month of the formation of the government). The VAT collection is also 30-40% higher than before under this government. <br/><br/>
Delhi budget is a surplus budget despite significantly higher allocation for health and education. <br/><br/>
That's how it is done.

with due respect to you. Your observation seems pessimistic and hopelessness that nothing can change. If chinese did it their way, India will do its own way. You should focus on what the AAP Government can do in 05 Years they have got rather than criticizing the PM. Lets be optimistic and hopeful. The steps are constructive by the Govt and we need to believe and be patient. We have been patient for 68 Years for a radical change, lets wait some more time

What PM Modi is doing is phenomenal hard work and none in your party can do it even for 1 hour. I work for a Investment firm in NYC and I can tell you, India desperately needs his initiatives and much more. If India is left for suckers and self-fish people like you, what would be left is sinking ship, probably that what you and your party men want.

But still we can't be so hopeless, Modi's initiatives have increased FDI in country, jobs are increasing, sentiments are positive. let us wait for some more time and see if he is having some different roadmaps, as everyone has his own way of working.

                            आज चीन , जापान , अमेरिका टेक्नोलॉजी में इतने आगे है , इन्होने तो कभी भारत आकर रिक्वेस्ट नहीं की ," हमारे यहाँ चलो आप लोग कुछ इन्वेस्ट करो " । इन देशों ने खुद अपने दम पर विकास किया है , किसी दूसरे देश के सामने गिड़गिड़ाए नहीं , क्योंकि इन देशो को अपने काबलियत और जनता पर भरोसा है। लेकिन भारत में तो …… भरोसा ही नहीं है जनता पर "साहेब" को। इतना समय यदि अपने देेश को घूमने में लगाया होता तो शायद एक साल में कुछ "मेक इन इंडिया " दिखने लगता और अपनी गहराई भी जान लेते कि "हम कहाँ पर खड़े है "। ये उन लोगों से "मत पूछो" जो आपकी "चमचागिरी" करते है , उन लोगों से "पूछो" जो दो वक्त की रोटी के लिए दिनभर संघर्ष करते है और जिन लोगों के कारन आज आप वहां पर खड़े है।

                            just keep your mouth shut, you were neither a good journalist not a politician. At least try to become a balanced person, but I know even that you can't become. You belong to a party which is turning out to be full of goons and arrogant people who are just power hungry. You guys just know how to blame PM and bjp for everything. Don't raise your standard by constant comparison with PM cos he is miles apart from hypocrites like you.

                            Mere slogan? If Apple/Foxconn sets up a manufacturing plant in India, Google invests on free Wi-Fi in India, and there is a 40% increase in FDI -- how is this a mere slogan?!<br/>
The fact is, that the PM is moving the needle in a meaningful way, and AAP is calling sour grapes on that. Grow up, please!
