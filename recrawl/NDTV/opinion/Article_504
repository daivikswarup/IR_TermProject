Headline::::We Have Not Proved Wholly Worthy Yet of Ambedkar's Legacy



DateTime::::2015-04-14T04:44:00+05:30



(Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)As the Government and political parties trip over each other to commemorate the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Bhimji Rao Ambedkar today, it would be a pity if the life of this extraordinary Indian were reduced to one issue - his championship of the Dalit cause - just as much as it would be wrong to gloss over his path-breaking role in that monumental endeavour.Dr Ambedkar is such an icon today that we fail to fully appreciate the remarkable scale of what he accomplished. To be born into what was called an 'untouchable' family in 1891, and that too as the 14th and last child of a poor Mahar subedar in an Army cantonment, would normally have guaranteed a life of neglect, poverty and discrimination. Not only did Dr Ambedkar rise above the circumstances of his birth, but he achieved a level of success that would have been spectacular for a child of privilege.One of the first Dalits ever to enter an Indian college, he became a professor (at the prestigious Sydenham College) and a principal (of no less an institution than Bombay's Government Law College). One of the earliest Indian students in the United States, he earned multiple doctorates from Columbia University and the University of London, in economics, politics and law. An heir to millennia of discrimination, he was admitted to the bar in London and became one of India's Founding Fathers as the Chair of the Constitution Drafting Committee. The son of illiterates, he wrote a remarkable number of books, whose content and range testify to an eclectic mind and a sharp, if provocative, intellect.That was not all: by the age of 40 he was speaking as one of India's recognized leaders at the Round Table Conference in London, and his convictions made him a political giant to be reckoned with in the fight for freedom. An insignificant infant scrabbling in the dust of Mhow in 1891 became the first law minister of a free India, in the most impressive Cabinet ever assembled in New Delhi. When he died, aged only 65, he had accumulated a set of distinctions few have matched; only one remained. In belated recognition of that omission, he was conferred posthumously in 1990 the highest award his country has to offer - the Bharat Ratna.Dr Ambedkar's greatness cannot be reduced to any one of these accomplishments, because all were equally extraordinary. Think of what he was born into and who he became, and even this bare outline of his life should take one's breath away.Dr Ambedkar was a self-made man in the profoundest sense of that term. Even his name was his own creation, for he was born a Sakpal, but decided to take a name based on that of his village (Ambavade) as Maharashtrian Brahmins did. (And he married a Brahmin.) It was part of his self-made style that he wore Western suits - not, as some nationalists alleged, in slavish imitation of the colonial rulers, but in rejection of the traditional trappings of a society that had for so long enslaved his people.It was he who forced India to confront the reality of discrimination by facing up to the reality of caste oppression. And he did so bluntly, in a manner which youngsters today would call "in your face". Not for him the mealy-mouthed platitudes of the well-meaning: he was prepared to rage against the injustice of social discrimination, and to do so in every forum available to him. It was an attitude that Indian society was not prepared for, but at a time when Indians were fighting for their freedom from foreign rule, it was both appropriate and necessary that Indians should fight equally against domestic oppression.Dr Ambedkar rejected what he saw as the patronizing indulgence of the Gandhian approach to untouchability. The Mahatma called them "Harijans" - children of God. Dr Ambedkar rejected the word - after all, he argued, aren't we all children of God? He used, instead, the Marathi and Hindi words for the 'excluded' (Bahishkrit), the 'oppressed' (Dalit) and the 'silent' (Muka) to define the outcastes.So even while fighting British rule, Dr Ambedkar was a tireless and courageous advocate of the Dalit cause, an enemy of cant and superstition, and an iconoclast who had contempt for traditions that he felt deserved no sanctity.As a nationalist, he was sensitive to the charge that he was dividing Indians at a time when they needed to be united against the British. His critics forget that Gandhiji himself acknowledged Dr Ambedkar's "sterling patriotism", brilliantly displayed in the first Round Table Conference. Yet when Dr Ambedkar demanded separate electorates for his people, Mahatma Gandhi undertook a fast unto death until an unconvinced Dr Ambedkar, fearing mass reprisals if the Mahatma died, caved in. Gandhiji, who abhorred untouchability, believed that the answer lay in the social awakening of caste Hindus rather than in building walls of separation.Dr Ambedkar, who lived with the daily reality of caste discrimination, was not convinced that the entrenched practices of traditional Hinduism could ever disappear. In the end, he found a Constitutional solution to remedy the injustices he fought against all his life.His faith in democracy, which he shared with Jawaharlal Nehru, is also one of his proud legacies to our country. Whereas some saw Ambedkar, with his three-piece suit and formal English, as a westernised exponent of occidental constitutional systems, he was inspired far more by the democratic practices of ancient India, in particular the Buddhist sanghas.Ambedkar saw in the institutions of Indian democracy that he was helping to create, the best guarantee for the future development and welfare of his own people, the oppressed and marginalised of India. He fought hard to introduce into the Constitution fundamental protections and guarantees of civil liberties for individual citizens.Ambedkar also convinced the Constituent Assembly that it was not enough to abolish untouchability: what was needed to undo millennia of discrimination and exploitation was a system of affirmative action to uplift the oppressed, including reservations of jobs in the civil services, schools and universities. This gave India the world's oldest and farthest-reaching affirmative action programme, which guarantees not only equality of opportunity but of outcome, with seats reserved for Dalits in Government jobs, universities and even in Parliament.Through his role Dr Ambedkar ushered in momentous change into Indian society and politics, but to him it had not come fast enough. He saw the entrenched practices of Hindu society as something he had to reject. "I am born a Hindu," Dr Ambedkar declared in 1936, "but I swear I will not die a Hindu." Twenty years later he died a Buddhist, months after converting with hundreds of thousands of his followers at a public ceremony.As a political leader, Dr Ambedkar was better at articulating powerful ideas than in creating the structures to see them through. None of the three parties he founded ever acquired the following or the permanence that his ideas deserved. But the Constitution of which he was the principal author remains the best instrument for pursuing his ideas. The leader and spokesman of a community left his greatest gift to all communities - a legacy that belongs to all of us, and one of which we are yet to prove ourselves wholly worthy.  Let us hope that this 125th anniversary year is not spent entirely in platitudes, but in an honest recognition of the life and the message of one of the greatest sons of India.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            After coming its tally to 44 in Lok Sabha.Congressmen like Mani, Tharoor etc etc have started talking as if they have been depositories of all virtues and knowledge in the world. According to Mani &amp; Tharoor, every bad thing is attributed to BJP &amp; Modi and good thing attributed to Congress ( Gandhis, Sonia, Rahul &amp; Priyanka)  We people of India should ensure Congress tally in next election to single digit so that these pious (!) souls will get moksha and readers would be saved from reading such enlightened (!) blogs.

                            And what have you and other leaders done to ensure equal opportunity for all, to ensure non-discrimination, to ensure the right to education in practise (NOT ON PAPER)? This is your fundamental duty as the government and YOU ALL HAVE FAILED INDIA - completely and thoroughly. Ambedkar's legacy in fact should make each one of you cower and hang your heads in shame.

                            In fact we have not proved worthy at all. No point sugar-coating the truth and hence lying! And who is to blame for this? Is it not the leaders of this country - who have done precious little in removing casteism and its most barbaric and evil practises? Is'nt it the leaders who have promoted a very unhealthy India of illiteracy and discrimination. And sadly you are one of them!!

                            I am seeing unnecessary comments so this is just a reply to such comments.<br/>
@People who say reservation is curse and blah blah- There is no reservation in sports, do you know how many medals we have in our kitty! Now you'll start blaming politics, so tell me how many dalit PMs India have so far? Zero right and where do we land? When our Ex.PM. Mr. Bajpayee needs knee surgery, a doctor is called from US. Where are all our meritorious doctors who are not from reservation category? So don't sing reservation song, do something.<br/>
@People who think constitution is copy paste- This is not a copy paste, he had to study constitution of sixty countries and then chose best things for you to survive in the world. Imagine an original constitution which suggested to cut your hand on writing such comments. Did you want that? Read any good law knowledgeable person...Be it Laxmikant or DD Basu and see how much appreciative they are!!!<br/>
@Now in last People who thing Dr. Ambedkar did only for Dalits- Do you know RBI? This was established on his recommendation to British govt. No one in India had that much knowledge to convince British. Do you know Power Grid that gives electricity? That is established by Dr. Ambedkar. Are you aware of labour laws? Dr. Ambedkar got it reduced from 13 hours to 8 hours. So guys don't just open your mouth with no sense. Have facts and then write.

Any idiot can understand that you cannot feed 14 Children on a Subedars Salary.  Why there is attempt by Congress to resurrect people who have long gone from this planet.<br/>
This is exactly the reason we have graduated from 3rd world to a 5th world country. Pity we do not have any pragmatic leader like Lee Kuan Yew.

                            all those who criticise Ambedkar must introspect before doing so, here are a few points to ponder on<br/>
1.) why is he still relevant in India? is this because even today there is gross mistreatment of our fellow Indians by us in the name of casteism<br/>
2.) have we achieved social equality and have become a caste free society? <br/>
3.) why do we still marry within our caste or gotra, if we dont belive in caste system.<br/>
4.)if the making of constitution required just a copy paste job, then why do you think there was no one else who could do it, despite having so many legal experts in the first parliament of Independent India? <br/>
5.)why was such an important task given to a man who was so incompetent that he could do only copy paste!!<br/><br/>
all those who criticise must crticise but please do it if you have something rational to say please do not insult this intellectual giant who is revered by so many indians

                            In his book, "Pakistan or the Partition of India",  Ambedkar writes, "The Muslim invaders, no doubt, came to India singing a hymn of hate against the Hindus. … Its (Islam's) growth is so thick in Northern India that the remnants of Hindu and Buddhist culture are just shrubs. Even the Sikh axe could not fell this oak."<br/><br/>
It is interesting to note that despite his views on casteism in Hinduism, Ambedkar saw Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism as ONE Indian culture, at the same time, categorically calling Islam an alien culture. In chapter 6 of the same book, he writes,<br/><br/>
"From a spiritual point of view, Hindus and Musalmans are not merely two classes or two sects such as Protestants and Catholics or Shaivas and Vaishnavas. They are two distinct species... For them Divinity is divided and with the division of Divinity their humanity is divided and with the division of humanity they must remain divided. There is nothing to bring them in one bosom."<br/><br/>
Ambedkar had unequivocally advocated for a population exchange in case of partition.  In fact, both Sawarkar and RSS were trying to keep India undivided, but Ambedkar, had other views. Some of these observations can be in sync with the reality today.

Although I am not a Congress follower but Congress was not that anti dalit as  is BJP. So mean to extinct congress to extinct that small faction among a reduced party which favours dalit up-liftment or anti discrimination. And your comments get maximum like. Dr. Ambedker has saw it 100 years ago that nothing can change discrimination against Dalits and women in Indian society. And he has done his best for the protection of both.

Were you not the one who made that (in)famous comment regarding your not travelling by "cattle class". So don't torment us with your pseudo love for Dr. Ambedkar. Also the whole world knows how much Nehru (the disaster of India) detested Dr. Ambedkar and was compelled to take him into the cabinet simply because Nehru had no other choice.

                            Congress people can't tolerate anybody who don't accept their superiority.If they cared so much about Dr.Ambedkar why he was awarded Bharat Ratna after decades of his death.Same applies for Sardar Patel also.When BJP is highlighting their contribution these people are creating noise.<br/>
     There are many people in the awardee's list we may not have heard the name before but people like Ambedkar,Patel were not appreciated after very long time.<br/>
     Though Ambedkar had wished to set the quota system for initial 10 years to promote the equal representation of all groups, later it got continued because in India everybody likes discounts.<br/>
     Though any form of reservation compromises quality,but what about the general academic standard of average students.Only 25% of the engineering students are eligible for a job in global standard and for general graduates it is too less and most of the students read just before exam.<br/>
     Quota system should be there but not in terms of caste...only on financial background..that too not more than 10-20 percent.Imagine a person getting IAS by quota and his children enjoys the reservation...what does that mean...he did not improve at all even after getting IAS?<br/>
     People doing govt must not get reservation for their children...and what is this creamy layer...4.5 Lacs per anum....its ridiculous when the Govt. defines the poverty standard 30 rupees a day...so all quota must stop immediately with exception of economic backwardness.

                            How can we say that Ambedkar left any sort of legacy?  Ambedkar was a US and UK educated, articulate, clever man whose one flaw was that he was not tough enough to let Gandhi fast unto death.  Had he been tough enough, there would not have been the remotest possibility that India would have been partitioned.  Nothing of what Ambedkar would have approved of obtains in India.  Instead, we have a nation inhabited by people like Tharoor (US educated), Aiyar (UK, Cambridge educated) and Ramesh (US educated), and these are just the named few of perhaps tens of thousands, who grovel at the feet of a semi-literate Italian waitress!  Ambedkar experienced the trials and tribulations of being born into an 'untouchable' family and he tried to do something about uplifting his people.  Tharoor, Aiyar and Ramesh had all the privileges of being born into the upper strata of society; they spend all the time they can, taking the nation down such that Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and of late Priyanka, unworthy all of them, are projected as great leaders who will take India forward.  In reality these characters are in it for themselves!

                            What would Ambedkar have thought of the status of Dalits in India today? After 68 years have reservations achieved what they set out to do? Or as the recent Supreme Court ruling striking down OBC reservations for Jats said, is it time to measure backwardness in more significant ways than caste alone? Each parameter of backwardness, social, educational or financial, should have separate yardsticks and separate affirmative actions. Backwardness measured in terms of caste alone has not served its purpose, but enhanced backwardness within backward castes instead. Time Parliament looked seriously at the suggestion of the Supreme Court.
