Headline::::BJP's Contempt For Arvind Kejriwal is an Insult to Delhi's People



DateTime::::2015-06-08T17:21:00+05:30




                                The BJP is a bad loser. It can't digest defeat; does not believe in accepting loss with dignity. After losing three consecutive assembly elections in Delhi, the BJP was convinced that it would win a massive mandate from the people in the 2013 elections, but AAP foiled that attempt and it could not fulfil its ambition to rule Delhi though it emerged as the single largest party with 31 seats.
The 2015 assembly elections proved to be even more cruel. The BJP came crashing down from 31 seats to three. This was the worst ever defeat for the BJP despite the soaring popularity of Modi and a wave in their favour just a few months before in the parliamentary election.
It was torture for the party and traumatic for its local leaders. They all harboured ambitions of becoming either the Chief Minister or at least ministers. But they were upstaged by a party which, compared to them, is just a toddler in politics. So I can understand the anger, frustration, irritation and bitterness of Mr Nalin Kohli. I don't mind his harsh words.
When he says that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is a "glorified municipal commissioner", I don't feel sad or offended or even insulted for two reasons. One, he is not insulting the man called Arvind Kejriwal, but the constitutional post of CM, which flows from the will of the people. No matter what he says or what the BJP utters, Arvind is an elected CM, and in the absence of the assembly in session, through him the will of the people is reflected.
So if he is contemptuous of Arvind Kejriwal, he is in fact insulting the sovereign will of the people. And in a democracy, it is the people at large whose will prevails and not that of individuals. Therefore even if he or the BJP hate him personally, they have to show respect to the man to maintain the dignity of the office. Frankly, it does not behove a party which is ruling at the Centre to call the Chief Minister a "glorified municipal commissioner." In their zest to demean him, they demean and belittle themselves.
I have context when I say that the BJP is a bad loser. In 2004, nobody had imagined that the BJP led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani could lose. They thought that India was shining and they would bask in that reflected glory. The election results broke their hearts. For the first two years after the loss, the BJP dreamed that the Manmohan Singh government would collapse and the BJP led by Advani would once again come back to power.
Unfortunately for them, that did not happen. In the 2009 elections, their frustration led them to call Dr Manmohan Singh all kinds of names. He was called "the weakest PM since Independence" despite the economy doing exceedingly well, as a result of which India had then emerged as the second fastest growing economy.
The BJP was not in sync with the people; personalised attacks did not give them any dividend and they lost badly; the Congress gained more than 60 seats.
The party repeated the same mistake again in the 2015 Delhi assembly elections. The BJP's campaign was vitriolic, personalised, abusive and bitter. As a political analyst, I could not believe that this was the party which had won a majority on its own at the Centre, and which had won most comfortably in Haryana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir.
Arvind's 'gotra' was targeted. His family was not spared. He was called a "Naxal" by the Prime Minister himself. And with every abuse hurled at us, we in the party used to rejoice. We knew it would help us and boomerang on them as the Indian psyche does not appreciate personalised attacks.
It was a catastrophic result for them. It was a personal blow to Mr. Modi, who had not lost a single election since becoming the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2002. He had walked like a colossus, trampling all opposition. The Delhi elections broke the myth of invincibility named Narendra Modi.
In our party, we had a premonition and had discussed internally that despite such a grand victory and a historic mandate of the people, we would not be allowed to rule peacefully. The BJP and central government did not disappoint us. Every possible obstacle has been created to trip the AAP Government. The LG's office has been blatantly used. An elected CM was not allowed to appoint his own Chief Secretary and other officers.
The Delhi High Court struck down the notification issued by the MHA in 2014. The court told them to respect the mandate of the people; yet the LG came out with a press release stating that the Anti-Corruption Bureau is under his jurisdiction. He has forgotten that the MHA had issued a notification clearly saying that the ACB can't take cognizance of the offence committed by a central government employee. The MHA now tells Arvind that he can't even borrow officials from other states, something that is a routine practice among states and union territories. And Nalin Kohli has the cheek to justify that order.
I was livid and at the same time could not stop laughing when I read Nalin Kohli's statement that the Delhi ACB can't buy surveillance equipment as Delhi is a national capital where all sensitive offices and embassies are located. Believe me, I have never heard a more stupid argument than this. I find it beneath my dignity to even respond to this. Now I am convinced that the BJP government led by Modi is seeking revenge from the people of Delhi for rejecting the BJP and making Arvind the CM. It's a schizophrenic response from a national party. I can't find a rational justification for what the BJP has been doing for the last two months.
It all started when the process of making the ACB stronger began. Is the BJP afraid that if the ACB is allowed to function then some central minister or top party functionary can be in jail soon?
There can be another reason too. AAP won Delhi despite Modi, Amit Shah, various cabinet ministers and MPs with practically no resources. The BJP, Modi and RSS are worried; they feel that if AAP is not restrained in Delhi and if they venture out, then they might weave the same magic across India and that will prove to be a disaster for their ambition to saffronise India. They know in their heart that in 1977 the Janata party with no organisation and resources soundly defeated the once invincible Indira Gandhi.
History was repeated in 1989 when the opposition led by VP Singh vanquished Rajiv Gandhi who had 415 MPs in the Lok Sabha. Even then the Opposition was not in very good health. Why go far? In 2014, Modi won by a huge margin. This was the time when nobody was willing to believe that the BJP will get a majority on its own. Modi is a smart politician and he knows that India is a different kind of democracy and if people believe in someone then they just pour their heart out and give their mandate irrespective of the organisation and resources.
It is then no wonder that the BJP led by Modi, whose spokesperson is Nalin Kohli, wants to kill the phenomenon called AAP and Kejriwal before it becomes a colossus nationally. Thus, the effort to demean us, discredit us. But AAP is on its way to fulfil its promises to the people. The people are with us. Thanks Kohli, for being contemptuous and insulting.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.

                            Bro, first things first. An issue which is pending resolution in court is not contempt, it is called constitutional resolution of conflict. Now for the definition of contempt, is calling LG a person who crawls to Amit Shah, Accusing a bureaucrat without any evidence of corruption, dismissing your own lokpal without informing the commissioner, silencing voices of dissent in your own party, now that is something which fits that definition.

                            Ashutosh, isn't Kejriwal's contempt of LG, Modi and constitution itself an isult to every Indian citizen. I'm a resident of Delhi and his extremely personal and derogatory statements by Kejriwal were completely uncalled for and the language wasn't civil at all and no rational or just person would defend them. I don't defend personal derogatory remarks by BJP people either. But at least LG had been completely civil in his demeanor, he should have been given that much respect

                            Delhi has voted this little dictator AK 67 in power and committed the biggest mistake of their life's for next 4.5 yrs. all he know is blame others, accuse people with out any proof, play politics over a farmers death, take head on the constitution &amp; all its functionaries, call anyone names who doesn't agree with him or lastly start agitation or dharna. Not sure he was voted for this, every-time he is challenged all he says Congress dose this or BJP did this etc.  he wants to change the constitution / functioning of things etc. as per his command if not then everyone is conspiring against him / aap. Did anyone asked him what happened to his lokpal demand ? What happened to their internal party lokpal who was sacked because AK 67 wanted that ? Delhi people need to know all this free water / electricity is a sham he is taking out money from state pension board and putting there - THERE ARE NO FREE LUNCHES IN THE WORLD. So let's not fool oursleves it's our fault we voted this little Hitler in power and he is living up to the expectation by showing how good DICTATOR he is !!

                            Ashutosh's statement is in line with what AK spoke in the interview. How strong is the logic that BJP does not permit AAP to function? There are many states which has non BJP govts and BJP would fail in some of the upcoming elections. That does not mean that those states would not be permitted to function. The AAP cult is unidirectional. They do not know governance neither do they want to govern. The negativity thrown around by these people is disturbing. Has any body asked AAP people what does AK mean by 'aisa hota hai' on locking a senior bureaucrat from his office? God save Delhi from this anarchy.

This is arguably the most inefficient, insufficient, inept and ridiculed Govt in any part of India since independence. In a democracy, people get the government they deserve, and Dehliites have to think whether they got fooled just for the sake of some cheap power and water, which might not be even available in 2-3 years if AAP continue the way they are now going.

Indeed you and entire team of yours is disrespect for Delhi... Stop politics and respect the mandate you've got from people..Else, you may again have to shed crocodile tears on national tv!!

                            Narcissism, bigotry, arrogance and abusive .... that's what defines AAP and AK. The interview showed all of this and more. When all is fine AK takes credit and blame BJP for everything else and abuse Modi. The repeated reference to the fact that Modi and BJP in the interview clearly show that he is nervous and scared.He realises that he has over promised and now realised that it will be difficult to meet them.

                            AK should introspect and resign on moral grounds for creating nuisance since being elected CM.  He has insulted Indian democracy and dignity of CM's office.  It is not too far if people of Delhi start slapping him.

                            After reading Ashutosh opinion I remember the movement AAP had started against Sheela Dixit in Delhi's rape case can not forgotten. Sheela Dixit was repeatedly informing that the Delhi Police falls under Lf Governor (Central Government) and not under me. Knowing this AAP just deliberately ignored this to establish its base in Delhi and on this issue it successfully could do so. Now that they are facing the same issue, Ashutosh, at least have a courtesy to admit that Sheela Dixit was not responsible in that famous rape case.<br/><br/>

                            Don't try to live in fool paradise quoting always massive mandate people gave you to govern Delhi. Even after 4 month since election, you are still in the grip of Victory march. Distributing freebie like water &amp; Reduced power without quality or for that matter pushing Discom to distress, if you were to call achievement. This could be done any or every CM or for that matter Modi also. When people have voted you, specially city state people of Delhi, they expect you people to govern &amp; not stereotyping or bashing of Constitutional post like LG. If you still want to continue your victory march &amp; for that matter want to quote this to your opponent, you are free to do so. But don't try to fool the people after scoring massive victory in the name of getting what you people can't get or Constitution never allows at this juncture !

                            Ashutosh ji, request you and your party to come out of blame game politics and work for the state otherwise AAP will become history. You call not respecting Mr Kejriwal is insult to people of Delhi. Same way you guys are also not respecting Mr. Modi. Moreover never ever dream of winning the national elections and assume that Mr Kejriwal can become PM. It will never happen. You guys are behaving as if BJP has suddenly changed rules in Delhi. These rules are in place for years and no one had so much of problems since 2002. This is not the way to run politics. Grow up guys and convey this message to Mr Kejriwal as well.

                            Mr.Ashutosh, Please clarify what u mean by "Now I am convinced that the BJP government led by Modi is seeking revenge from the people of Delhi for rejecting the BJP". I expected better english from a english language media person than this. Anyway this one line shows what is the level of thinking process and what thoughts transpire in the mind of AAP leaders.Suffice is to say that, while the governors of states are never called Lieutenant.Governor, so also the Chief Minister of a such a state is not a full fledged chief minister. If the person occupying such a seat and the people who elected him to that seat are unaware of this simple established fact, then it only shows the illiteracy and the power lust of the elected people. There are more states and union territories which dont have BJP as the ruling dispensation, none of them are happy with every act of the central government, but at the same time none of them are on the streets and in the media everyday cribbing about the central government. When the Delhi municipalities came to arivind kejriwal for funds, he asked them to resign and go and his party will take care of the municipalities, now its the turn of the central government to say the same words. Mr.Ashutosh remember you reap what u sow.

Everytime I see either of you two on the Idiot Box, and I reminded of 'Sukhilala' of 'Mother India', a conniving fox, who contorts and convulses to gain an upper hand but in the end is put into his proper place...

                            On same lines, AAPs contempt for BJP is contempt to India's people who chose Modi and BJP. Don't put 39% vote argument forward as India's 39% is exponentially more even if AAP would have got 100% in Delhi which is certainly not the case. Instead of telling others bad losers, be a good humble winner and focus on governance. Self proclaimed righteousness is useless. If you really trust the people of India, focus on giving good governance and they will see for themselves instead of doing this day to day TAMASHA and NEGATIVE ARTICLES.

Except for AAP's office bearers and ministers everyone else is corrupt, inefficient, unscrupulous, destroyer  of democracy, autocratic, fascist, henchman etc etc. You guys fight amongst yourselves for loaves of the office, back stab even your founding members, bark incessantly and display uncouth behaviour in TV debates (especially those who were in media who now see themselves as the holy Brahmins of media). And your chief considers himself as a paragon of virtue who has descended from heavens to save the country from sure disaster and destruction. Come on, have some sense, have some humility, get rid of the displaying the martyr syndrome that the whole world is out to destroy you as if the rest of India has no other business to transact and that India wakes up every morning with only one thing on its mind and agenda - how to destroy AAP. It is time for you guys to stop being crying babies, shut up and work. Reading these views, we now know what will germinate in your mind - that I must be A BJP or Congress mender sympathiser or fan. No sir, I am neither of these. Until recently, I WAS an AAP fan, a sympathiser and its strong advocate, but NOT any longer. Of course you will trash one such mail proclaiming with your swollen heads and loud mouths - see we have 67 seats!!

I agree Delhi needs better governance and better policing. That might happen if the police works under state government. But same time Delhi is capital of India. It has central government which is above the state government. As shown earlier AAP want to govern the central government too. I have not forgotten AAP asking ACB to file case against Veerappa Moily who was a central minister. This is the reason central government will not give more power to Delhi government under AAP. <br/><br/>
If AAP really wants to get the power to govern the state then it should talk to center government. Not dictate what it wants. People will soon realize AAP is just after power.

                            Ever since you have come to power, every AAP member is speaking against BJP and Modi in every single article or interview.  I have not seen a single article or interview where you not criticized center. SOMETHING IS HILARIOUSLY WRONG WITH YOU.

                            You say "Therefore even if he or the BJP hate him personally, they have to show respect to the man to maintain the dignity of the office.".  Then why cannot advice your friend kejri not to SPEAK BAD OF LG WITH WORST LANGUAGE.   You are also a rogue.

                            In that case the same should apply to your boss , who is disregarding the mandate of people of india and the laws which exists today . He understood that Delhi is an Union Territory and was not made so after his elections. This was how that state has been run ever since independence. I dont understand why he is making issues . Ask him to learn to work within the existing system , or initiate process to get system changed . Dont brawl on national television, CM of a state should not have spoken in that language.

                            Arvind's naming MOdi is an Insult to whole of India and of Delhi too, Bcz delhi did chose Modi (7-0), when he fought for opinion.

                            Ashutosh, do whatever you want, u r not going to get RS nomination in 2018, it will be for AK's friends in bureaucracy, SS and Khetan. So try collecting as much of ammunition as possible to blackmail AK, any sting related to AK and Gang involvement with Jindals,   Birlan corruption etc will work

                            The biggest reason is failure in Varanasi followed by taking on single agenda of anti modi instead of governance.

                            BE WRONG AT THE TOP OF YOUR VOICE AND PROVE YOURSELF RIGHT IS THE THEORY AAP BELIEVES IN.<br/><br/>
SURPRISED TO SEE SOME COMMENTS ON NATIONAL TV AND WRITINGS OF MR ASHUTOSH ON DELHI GOVERNANCE, CONTRADICTION WITH LG AND CENTRAL GOVT.<br/><br/>
AAP AND ESPECIALLY MR. ASHUTOSH SHOULD REMEMBER THAT WHEN HE ON NATIONAL TV OR WRITING AN ARTICLE IT READ BY LITREATE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT IS GOOD AND WHAT IS BAD. <br/><br/>
IF WE CAN GIVE YOU ABSOLUTE MAJORITY, WE CAN BRING YOU DOWN AS WELL. <br/><br/>
IT IS BETTER TO BE FAIR AND THERE IS NOTHING WRONG IN ACCEPTING THE FAILURES. AFTER ALL FAILURE IS A STEP TOWARDS LEARNING.<br/><br/>
BE FAIR AND DONT UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF COMMON MAN. RIGHT NOW RESOLVE POWER / WATER / MCD CRISIS.................................

                            ...and your - AAP's - contempt for NDA Govt/ NaMo is garlanding the people of India??<br/><br/>
Get real and start delivering. Enough of blaming everyone else for your shortcomings. Be man enough to do something.
