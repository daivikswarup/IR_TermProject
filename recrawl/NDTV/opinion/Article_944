Headline::::The Stupid Decisions That Left Chennai So Vulnerable



DateTime::::2015-12-03T20:58:00+05:30




                                So I watched with my jaw dropping the aerial pictures sent to us by a colleague in Chennai who was on the chopper with the army. I watched as food packets plunged through the air to people packed onto roof tops with water everywhere around them. What I also saw was the Adyar river without an inch of space around it to move or breathe. I saw a city that has just grown like a group of mushrooms but with far less intelligence.

Let me make a huge call out to the residents of my city. I watched as they showed unbelievable resilience as they battled power cuts, communication failures, lack of food, incessant rain, rising flood waters and lost homes. I salute a city that came forward and helped its own with countless acts of the kindness of strangers. I especially want to make special note of the true mark of responsible citizenship: there have been no reports of looting or break-ins or anything like that. When Hurricane Katrina pounded new Orleans, crime levels went through the roof. Not in Chennai where people have opened their homes, devoted their time to distributing relief material around, helped rescue people while battling their own problems.

34 cm of rain in one day is a record by any standards. It is pretty much more rain in one day than most countries get in a year. That is a challenge for any administration no doubt. Rain like that will also cause some damage - again, no arguments there - but the scale of the damage can be squarely blamed on shocking urban planning.
When I was a student and spent my first twenty years in Chennai, every year at this time, we would get heavy rains, a cyclone - it would all be dramatic but nothing at this level. The Adyar River that has borne the brunt of all the water flowing into the city has been in spate. Unfortunately, the river does not have banks, let alone a flood plain.A flood plain gives a river room to overflow.
Consider this:
1) Most of the southern suburbs sit right on the river banks
2) The airport sits on the flood basin of the river. The second runaway, in fact, was built over the river.
3) The Cooum River is flowing well above the danger mark. The normal flow is blocked by garbage and even settlements in areas where it runs dry. 
4) Places like SRM, Satyabhama College, the much-vaunted IT corridor and the Phoenix malls sit on water bodies.
5) The flow of the Oterri canal in North East Madras is also blocked by the bypass that connects NH45 to NH4.
These are just some of the humongously stupid decisions taken in the urban planning but there are many more. The Buckingham Canal, which is meant to act as the drainage for South Madras is blocked not just by garbage and rubble, but an entire colony called MRC Nagar sits on its overflow. Coastal construction norms have been violated and so high tide pushes any water trying to discharge into the ocean right back into the city. The drainage system has not been over hauled in a long time and many of the drains are blocked by garbage and rubble. No one weather event can be taken as an example of climate change, but climate change can cause extreme weather events to happen more frequently.
 
Traffic cops clearing the roads after heavy rains causes floods in Chennai.
We can only hope that this freak rain was just that, freak, and that we won't see it for a long time if ever. However, the lessons learnt from playing fast and loose with the hydrology of a city is one we had better start working on because climate change is here, and if we hope to adapt, we have to learn that economy will not work without a strong foundation of ecology.(Swati Thiyagarajan is an Environment Editor with NDTV)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Indins have seen flood, earthquakes, riots, and many more calamity. Can anyone please provide any lesson we have learnt from the past to make our future better? Two things we would do at the most 1) We'd praise the spirit of local and might sing some patriotic movie songs 2) We would abuse the Govt system and bad mouth politicians. Withing couple of days life would get normal as some other news will have our attention. Very tragic and sad but thats India..!!!!!!

This incident should be used as a wake up call for better infrastructure planning across the country. Climate change is here, and India is far from prepared for it.

                            When you refill and reclaim ponds and lakes and also low lying areas for construction activity block the flow of water in the topological water table zones, Mother Nature will strike back, yes sadly this time she has spoken back. This is a 100% man made disaster. Yes and we all also know the culprits. Its High time at least name them, least prosecute them, which we don't even expect in TN. for the record Mumbai has learnt that lesson on 26 July 2005, this time Madras is learning the same lesson.

                            Well in the eyes of the people in industry and finance and as well as IT, the brand image of Chennai has taken a severe beating. Who is going to pay for the damaged aircraft on the Airport? the lost work hours in IT and ES offices, loses in the Industrial units? and why do we ask? reason is its because this is a man made disaster, everything that happened was due to actions taken by the Tamilnadu state government and Chennai Municipal corporation, and also the various agencies that allowed and turned a blind eye to what was happening in the older name Madras and the latter name Chennai, so all of this has its roots in the 1990's if I am not mistaken.

                            We are a country who love to deliberate after the calamity occurs. Its easy to look back and blame urban planning after disaster strikes, but what steps do we take to prevent disaster? Look at Bangalore, a beautiful city with several lakes is choking its guts out. the Lakes have been encroached, they either don't exist or what remains is a foaming mass of sewage. There are buildings coming up everywhere encroaching the few remaining critical natural resources right under the nose of public and authorities. Its another disaster waiting to happen. And after it strikes, we can say, "Oh, this is all Govt.s's fault, it is all because of bad urban planning'

                            Excellent . You are 100 percent right, Madam.<br/>
It is all due to greediness of humans. As Mahatma Gandhiji said,"The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed." With political influence people occupy canal bunds and encroach irrigation canals passing through towns. This is common in many states,thanks to political vulnerability and people in power corruption. Also one has to think of giving permission to multi storeyed buildings without proper drainage facilities. Now it is floods and a day may come when ground water depletion takes place by overexploitation of ground water by Apartments,Aqua culture etc. May of the ills we face are due to excess carbon in the atmosphere. "Energy,Ecology and Economy' are interlinked. One has to live in harmony with nature.<br/>
The Union Government wants Smart Cities. When we cannot set right present problems faced in cities,how to cope up with future problems . The immediate step would be Carbon sequestration to combat Global warming and Climate change.<br/>
I have a simple solution to reduce Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere:<br/>
The gas responsible for the most warming is carbon dioxide, also called CO2. Different greenhouse gases have very different heat-trapping abilities. Some of them can even trap more heat than CO2. A molecule of methane produces more than 20 times the warming of a molecule of CO2. Nitrous oxide is 300 times more powerful than CO2. Other gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons (which have been banned in much of the world because they also degrade the ozone layer), have heat-trapping potential thousands of times greater than CO2. But because their concentrations are much lower than CO2, none of these gases adds as much warmth to the atmosphere as CO2 does.<br/>
CAM Plants to act as Carbon Sink.<br/>
Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a photosynthetic adaptation that facilitates the uptake of CO2 at night and thereby optimizes the water-use efficiency of carbon assimilation in plants growing in arid habitats. A number of CAM species have been exploited agronomically in marginal habitats, displaying annual above-ground productivities comparable with those of the most water-use efficient C3 or C4 crops but with only 20% of the water required for cultivation. Such attributes highlight the potential of CAM plants for carbon sequestration and as feed stocks for bioenergy production on marginal and degraded lands.<br/>
The Central Government and State Governments can draw a plan to utilise vast waste lands for Carbon sequestration. Unemployed youth can be given 10 acres each on long lease and 10 such forms a co-operative to grow multiple use plants like Agave,Opuntia,Annona Squamosa etc. They can set up local units for Biogaspower/biogasfuel/biochar. Even biogas can be supplied to villagers through pipes.<br/>
The most effective way of reducing the risk to people and property is through the production of flood risk maps. Most countries have produced maps which show areas prone to flooding based on flood data. In the UK, the Environment Agency has produced maps which show areas at risk. The Flood map shows the flood plain for a 1 in 100 year flood , the predicted flood plain for a 1 in 1000 year flood and low lying areas in need of flood defence. The most sustainable way of reducing risk is to prevent further development in flood prone areas and old waterways. It is important for at-risk communities to develop a comprehensive Floodplain Management plan.<br/>
Designers and Planners vision and responsibility:<br/>
Lessons from the Grand Anaicut of Tamil Nadu<br/>
The Cauvery River, as seen in the image above is split into two channels by the island of Srirangam. While the southern channel retains the name Cauvery, the northern channel is called as Kollidam or Coleroon River. These two channels come close again downstream and it is at this strategic meeting point that Karikala Cholan decided to build the Kallanai. Karikalan built the Kallanai for mainly two reasons: Flood control and Irrigation. Having witnessed the river causing great floods during the rainy season and also forcing droughts during the dry months, he and his advisors devised this grand project to maintain a steady flow of water throughout the year. The dam was constructed from unhewn stone and is 329 m (1,079 ft) long, 20 m (66 ft) wide and 5.4 m (18 ft) high. The dam has since been developed by the British who laid the grid separators and a bridge on top of the old dam.<br/>
The story of the Kallanai imparts some very important lessons for the Design world. Foremost is the amazing vision that Karikalan possessed. When he decided to build a dam across the Cauvery River he could have easily just thought of something a little less grand and achievable based on the technical and monetary reservations of his time but Karikalan did not just think of the near future. When he stood on the mud banks and pictured his dam, he imagined it to stand for a very long time to come. And it is his extraordinary long term planning and foresight that is reflected in the fact that the Kallanai is still in excellent condition even after almost 2000 years.<br/>
Karikalan's story of an extraordinary long term vision, meticulous planning and astounding execution of an engineering marvel makes sense even today. A culture of long term thinking with the ability to look at the long term benefits becomes more vital in a world today that seems content with temporary solutions. The design field particularly can learn a lot from examples such as the Kallanai about the importance of vision in Design.<br/>
• How relevant are the long term benefits of any product or service?<br/>
• What solutions can a Design provide and how permanent is it?<br/>
• Can our service or solution add more value than what is expected?<br/>
• How much more effort do we need to put in to turn an ordinary solution into a more robust, long term and innovative one?<br/>
• Is it all worth it?<br/>

                            Great analysis although these are all well known facts. The question is why don't the shameless CM or her cronies or Karuna and his petty criminals do anything about this? Why do the people of Chennai keep electing these robbers them alternately? Why don't we see citizens protest in good weather days? Because they are too busy themselves building on every inch of land, land grabbing if they have the power and erecting slums if they are too poor and otherwise weak.  Everyone is tossing garbage on the roads and ditches, and when asked it is met with a angry is it your road response, and at times even with violence.  Now all citizens of the city are paying a price. Will they wake up? Something tells me they will not and will wait for the next disaster to come strike. That I am afraid may not be 100 years away.  2017 possibly? Is Chennai ready? Who cares.

Because, there will be a swift answer back fired, Why did the government approve all these places for residential plots when they were not safe?.... So, we can ask..<br/>
Who is the planning authority? - Were they all just politicians? We they all uneducated people? Were they all just authorities of tamilnadu?... We all were part of it, common citizens who worked in many departments of these government organisations that approved or planned the city. All were IAS officers, Grade I-IV officers,businessmen,politicians and more importantly parents or grandparents of the current generation.....

                            While your arguments are very sound and profound, there are a few q's<br/><br/>
Please note, I am not trying to mock your arguments. These are real questions with a thirst for real answers.<br/><br/>
a. What should a realistic urban plan look like ? Every country including Singapore do build huge structures on reclaimed land. Hence, is this something wrong with civil engineering itself ? How many KMs from the sea is it safe to start building ? If I am not wrong, prior to the tsunami, Chennai's buildings did have a greater distance from the sea.<br/><br/>
b. Chennai did implement things like rainwater harvesting and the density of buildings as well as their sizes are relatively well distributed than other metros (barring Chandigarh). This being the case, how can an urban transition occur ? <br/><br/>
c. It is easy to say lack of infra in every case. But why should a city like chennai which remains in drought for the better part of the decade over-invest in things like this. For example, while earthquakes are also a possibility, it cannot be estimated to build every building with the expectation that it would be the epicenter of a 7.1 quake, right.

                            In the NDTV discussion on the Chennai floods on 1 Dec 2015, almost all participants including the Hydrology experts blamed the TN government or the Chennai Corporation for thoughtlessly damaging the system by widespread construction and encroachment on drainage systems. The problem has to be analysed better and appropriate immediate and long term solutions found and implemented. The Hydrology cycle is not the drainage alone. The IGNOU text book on Elementary Hydrology clearly points out that the Hydrology cycle is 1) circulation of liquid water from the sea, lakes on land and plants to the atmosphere as vapour (gas form of water) through evaporation by energy from sun and sunlight, 2) condensation of the gas to tiny liquid or ice and its precipitation back to the earth's surface as rain and finally 3) the return of the rain water to the oceans and lakes through ground water flow, surface runoff and drainage systems like rivers. Affected severely by the floods, people only blame the poorly designed drainage system,related to the third of the Hydrology cycle. The first, evaporation to the atmosphere has increased. The second, condensation and precipitation from atmosphere to earth too has increased and also fallen to extremes like low rains and torrential rains. The water as gas in the atmosphere, water vapour changes to tiny water droplets by condensation. The condensation of water vapour, or water in gas form, needs presence of nuclei. The tiny condensed water droplets have to be stimulated to join together and form precipitation drops that finally fall to the ground as rain. Ice nuclei like dry ice, lead iodide and cupric sulphide are used in the new technology of Cloud Seeding for artificial rain. The reason for extreme rains is the presence of nuclei that condenses the vapour and other material that makes the small droplets bigger. The gas pollution from automobile vehicles, aircraft jets, burnt industrial, agriculture and housing waste, chemical processes could be the culprits that today lead to torrential rain. That is the reason why extreme rains fall in desert regions like Saudi Arabia, Europe and in India. We have to turn down our dangerous practice of running gas burning vehicles, burning agriculture waste (in Punjab and Haryana), plastic, tyre, town and village waste in Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkotta and other places.<br/><br/>

                            To combat flood I suggest that each state builds its own waterways (water canals) (40 to 50 meter wide and 7 to 10 feet deep) connecting various parts of a state. These sate waterways should then be interconnected to make national waterways. Flood in any state at a given time can be tackled easily by pumping out water from flooded canals to other state canals where flood is absent. Such water ways can yield immense economic benefit. It can sustain large quantity of fish and other aquatic life. It can provide very economic transportation of goods to different parts of India. It can balance ecology and prevent drought and sustain irrigation of farms on its bank. However dropping grabage and waste materials/toxic materials should strictly be prohibited. Such canals lined with trees can present a lovely scene to visitors/tourists.

                            TOI had a 1 column X maybe 10 cm news item on its front page re. Chennai floods. Malaysian newspaper STAR has a full front page on it. So where are our priorities. Media in India can at best be time pass not a balanced source of news - as long as some of us atleast can understand and articulate this, then most of us need &amp; will not be not overly disappointed. What the knowledgeable Environment Editor has stated above is nothing new. Whenever there is disaster of this type, there is mushroom growth of such intellectual articles filled with "never before known facts &amp; analysis with a overwhelming dose of do's and dont's". In other words such pieces are an insult to people on the street in chest deep waters helping out. They may not articulate but they act! This is probably the most serious negative about online and social media. We have always been a nation of talkers as compared to doers in a 80:20 proportion. The advent of online &amp; social media has made us even worse - most of us are now convinced our civic duty ends when we write an article or post a feedback, most of it as anonymous comments. If atleast the person who has written the article and those who have posted feedback have their conscience clear that they have physically and substantially contributed in 'such circumstances' in real measurable terms, then that will be a good start. That is what the nation needs. Not opinions which we have in plenty. Or else all these columns and opinions will just amount to a colossal waste, other than just making the writer and the 'feedbackers' maybe a bit heady and happy.

                            Every city has its limits. If its a planned city, it knows its limits. If unplanned, like most of our cities &amp; metros, no one knows the limits. The legislature doesn't heed the technocrats's advice, the bureaucracy is hand-in-glove with the politicians and both encourage corruption, citizens don't care to be selectively corrupt if it is in their personal interest(and encouraging corruption), which is the main reason for such disasters. <br/><br/>
And when something like this happens, everyone becomes an expert in analyzing the cause. Once the euphoria subsides, it is business as normal.

                            TCS, Cognizant and Infosys created this mess by inducting lakhs of young minds and doing modern day slavery .They funded the ministers and high officals in government to get cheap lands on water beds for doing their outsourcing business. This made thousands and thousands of people from villages in and around tamil nadu to skip their agriculture and started to settle with their son and daughters in urban setup of chennai ,ruining the backbone of nation. Employees of these companies , purchased apartments constructed on lake beds and near by lakes using their hard earned money. These companies are the ones who create the real inflation and too much real estate blip in a city with no basic infrastructure .They also drain the health of the young people once they reach 35's and 40's and fire them at last. Ordinary people are the real losers and these companies have a strong insurance claim to recover their losses.

River, lakes water bodies are most of the time dry, so people just occupy. We can write pages and pages of stuff to fix the problem, we have great institution that teach all the stuff and students score high grades (sometimes 100%). But, maybe 1-10% of the govt/private follow the best practices. Corrupt Politicians and govt bureaucrats have ruined India. Sometimes I am just "shocked" when good things happen in spite of all the corrupt system, those few brave hearts are the ones keep the country running.<br/><br/>

                            Very true.. The Indian cities are developed merely for economical gains ignoring completely ecological aspects. For instance, everyday there are lot many lake encroachments taking place in IT city of B'lore killing precious water bodies and Politicians are least bothered about it. If we have vision of seeing stable and prosperous cities we should build it on strong economic and ecological base.

Before Comparing to any developed country on matters like this we should think twice. We are no way near any of the western countries in infrastructure and city/town planning. A little rain and any city/town in India has floods all over. Look how this city expanded, illegal constructions in river beds and no planning on rain water management led to this massive flooding. This kind of corruption and citizen non-responsibility doesnt happen there.

We take pride in criticizing politicians, its almost impossible to make a plan for calamity that occurs once in 100 years. About planning of city, we should better digest this fact, India is going to be ad-hoc planned for ever. We could had done planning 40-50yrs back, but now, its impossible. Its liking being in 2BHK flat, having full family, furnitures etc, asking getting painted it. Top of that some season one of kids either having exam or some another important event.<br/><br/>

                            It is easy to pontificate after the event!.  The blame for this disaster has to be placed squarely on the administrations which have been having a stranglehold in the state - the Congress and the Dravidian parties.the blame has to be shared also by the dumb people who swayed by the 'freebies' given out by the parties cast their votes repeatedly to these parties. Whether it is the "Amma" or the "Appa", ( that is the appellation given to Karunanidhi in inner circles)  though both refer to the venerable Father and Mother parts of family, have been the most damaging and selfish to the common man. Be that as it may, let us at least now wake up and throw all these rotten eggs out and start afresh. But the question is who???

Being a guest in Chennai only, I am missing official information and reliable statements and weather forecasts. Also, the police was not visible and citizens had to divert the traffic in Guindy and elsewhere.<br/>
There should be an emergency system and communication, including non commercial TV and radio stations. Sorry to say, NDTV is horrible to watch.<br/>
Obviously, no buildings should have been built in lower areas and the infrastructure should be more resilient. Also the river needs more overflow space. And blocking water flow in river, canals and drainages is a no-no.<br/>
I don't think you can blame your politicians only, although the CM and PM at least showed up, there message was mediocre.

                            The point you made here and during the live coverage are excellent. This is a twin problem, but the problem could have been avoided all together if it were for better planning during city development. The main reason is the High El Nino activity coupled with the Anomalies in NE Monsoon. But the impact/damage caused by such downpour could have been mitigated, if we had not expanded the city into marshes and lakes. I don't think we can go forward by blaming the politicians - for they are always corrupt. We need to find a way where we can by-pass them. Citizens should rely more on common sense and not buy property in areas prone to flood risk. Almost all locals in Chennai know that many of these affected areas are low lying marshes and lakes. The only thing that was not controllable was the overflowing of Adayar - but that too would have been alleviated if the Buckingham canal was clear and other water drainage were functional.  In short, its a collective failure and the politicians themselves will pay attention to the drainage systems after the city recovers. Brilliant insight by you Swati

And like in all chaos systems, they work. I agree that we need urban planning but we need innovative thinking and planning and should not throw the rule book at the problem.

A renowned journalist on his personal blog blames all for this bias and reasons that they dont have news sourcing in the south - why the heck then you call yourself national media.<br/>
Another national channel and Publication covered the flood with news of GrantTrunk Express/JammuTawa Exp/TamilNadu Exp being delayed and airport  with NO proper answers on when they will resume services - Bloody there are 7 million people in the city without power, phone supplies, all cellular phone networks down - millions of friends and relatives struggling to get in touch with the city and this channel is busy informing about airport closure and no authority is responding to them about resuming services - are they not stupid?<br/><br/>

                            What kind of Environmentalist editor. I have doubt abt whether she knows anything abt environment. New York City Recd record Rainfall and flooded. London recd record rainfall and flooded. This year Wimbeldon in England had temp above 42 degree which never happened so far!!!. First ask yourself why such a downpour come this year? After such downpour flooding unavoidable. What is the change in the environment causing increase in the temp by 3 to 5 degree above normal in summer and heavy downpour. We are responsible. The whole world is responsible. Using A/C insensibly, Burning the tyres and other stuff. Family having more than four cars. Using all old bulbs. Building high structure in Lake beds etc. Use the A/C sensibly( One A/c Per house that too when temp is above 35 degree. Not  when it is 25 degree itself some ppl uses 5 A/cs in their house)

                            I agree with the writer to certain extent regarding encroachment of lakes and ponds and total lack of disregard of town planning. This is definitely the job of the local governments and planning engineers we can't blame the general public for that. Let me also quickly mention that here in Hyderabad there used to be thousands of lakes and ponds; when I was a kid there was a pond every few hundred meters in Hyderabad. But alas thanks to the total stupid town planners here now we have a similar mess like in Chennai.<br/>
In the men time praying for our people in Chennai.

                            Good article. I experienced floods/heavy rains during my high school days at Chennai in the 70s and never a problem. Maybe bad for 3 or 4 days and then the city would bounce back. Climate change may or may not be a factor but one thing for sure - if you do not fix the smog and car pollution over a city then Mother Nature will fix it for you.

I wish this flood washes out all the idiotic politicians (that include all in DMK &amp; AIADMK who held power) and make this historic city a clean city for the Tamil people.

                            We heard that Adyar river was with breadth 250 meteres stretch. Now it has come to just 25 meteres wide.<br/>
what we should do now is arrange proper places to the affcted people who were living in the river side earlier. And demolish all the buildings, huts everything and make the river sides wider atleast to 150 mts. We saw small roads have become 4 / 6 lanes. Like that this should be done at the earliest to avoid next disaster. Let the IT companies, Industries, Engineering colleges be in outskirts of the city. So that we can avoid maximum noise,water,sound pollutions.

The govt must take this initiative to create more awareness waste disposals. town planning should team must wake up to act accordingly. This is not the worst rains but it's the worst flooding

                            This is certainly a man-made disaster. Why government is allowing industries to concentrate in one pocket or city only? If this goes on unabated, tomorrow this will be the turn of Bangalore, Mumbai, Kolkata and other developing metros. Unless job market and industries are dispersed, cities will choke with rain, pollution or other calamities. I think the government should tax 50% extra levies to industrial tax (excise) and 20% extra to personal income tax for these cities. This will create necessary fund to cater to such emergencies and at the same time deter industries in concentrating on one city only. Unfortunately, the reverse is done by the government - employees in bigger cities are paid much higher allowances.  This is a double whammy. Unless deterrent actions are taken, it will lead to uniform growth and development across the state.

                            Wonderful insight but I noticed "Chennai" is full of irony. On one hand the inhabitants open their house and heart to the needy..however they seems so naive at letting human greed prevail over nature at the first place.

                            Overcrowding crowded cities with no anticipation of basic infrastructure leads to suffering and causing deaths of innocent citizens. Our universities generate a whole lot of civil engineers but then they get entangled either in bureaucracy or corruption. We have a lot to learn from western democracies - corruption exists but the lay man who slogs like a bull and pays his taxes get the minimum required services.
