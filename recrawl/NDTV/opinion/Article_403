Headline::::What PM Modi Must Learn From Arvind Kejriwal



DateTime::::2015-02-09T15:37:00+05:30



Harsh V. Pant is Professor of International Relations at King's College London. His most recent book is "India's Afghan Muddle" (HarperCollins).
	According to most exit polls, it is likely that the elections in Delhi are likely to produce a government of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). This will be a remarkable win for a party that was comprehensively rejected in the May 2014 parliamentary elections and that had forfeited considerable credibility after it failed to govern Delhi, deciding instead to shun responsibility after a mere 49 days in office. That Delhi voters are ready to give AAP another chance in February 2015 is testament to the hard work that AAP members have done in the last few months to reinstate confidence in their party's ability to deliver on its key commitments. AAP had emerged out of the peculiar circumstances of the anti-corruption movement in Delhi, so the capital was always the test case of the workability of the idea of a non-establishment party.
	Two successive victories clearly imply that the AAP is an idea whose time has indeed come. Of course, how AAP governs over the next five years will determine if the idea is sustainable. The party's agenda still remains largely underdeveloped and full of contradictions. But they seem to have crossed the first hurdle of a democracy: gaining confidence of the electorate.
	If exit polls are correct, then one of the main reasons behind AAP's impending win seems to be the complete collapse of the Congress in Delhi much like in the rest of India. This too is remarkable for a party that was in power in Delhi for 15 long years and now finds its Chief ministerial candidate struggling to win in his constituency. The Indian electorate in 2015 is looking for fresh ideas and willing to take risks. A perpetually risk-averse Congress with a tired Dynasty at the helm is hardly an appealing option.
	But it will be the BJP which will inevitably find itself on the backfoot if the losses predicted by exit polls manage to hold up. After staking so much on a state election, with Prime Minister himself asking people to vote for him, the party will have to introspect what went so wrong in just eight months that the nation's capital refused to listen to Modi, deciding instead to cast their lot with an "anarchist." It was not AAP but the BJP who made this contest between Modi and Arvind Kejriwal. Recognising his mistake from the Lok Sabha elections, Kejriwal from the very beginning refrained from taking on Modi directly, instead prodding the BJP to name its Chief Ministerial candidate. When the BJP did eventually name Kiran Bedi, it was too late in the game and there was widespread dissent within the party. Moreover, the BJP ran a thoroughly negative campaign with the party's entire top leadership focused on spitting venom on Kejriwal.
	For Modi, these elections should lead to some reassessment about his party and his government's priorities. In India, there is a perpetual election cycle with some state or the other going to elections every few months. In his last eight months, Modi has been campaigning incessantly. The BJP has every right to use their most powerful asset in elections and Modi as the nation's Prime Minister can for sure use these elections to reach out to the masses. But staking his government's credibility on every state election is clearly neither desirable nor necessary.
	The people of India gave Modi a decisive mandate to govern, and govern effectively. And if AAP's war cry of anti-corruption is still managing to cut ice with ordinary voters in the nation's capital, it clearly means that Modi's governance paradigm leaves much to be desired. Modi's inability and/or unwillingness to rein in the rabid elements of the Sangh Parivar has also cost the BJP. His governance agenda seems to be losing traction between inane controversies such as 'Love Jihad' and 'Ghar Wapsi' to repeated incendiary statements by some members of his own party. For a political leader who loves to be in control, this disarray has been widely interpreted as one by design.
	Modi will also have to recognise that he is the establishment now. Unlike the Lok Sabha elections where he railed at the establishment and projected himself as the outsider, it was Kejriwal who in Delhi elections was the anti-establishment voice. All the arguments that Modi successfully deployed against the Congress-led political order, Kejriwal has used against the Modi-led establishment at the centre. And nothing symbolises the arrogance of political power more than the suit with his name emblazoned all over it. Modi who is fond of reminding voters of his humble origins clearly failed to anticipate the challenge from a muffler-draped Kejriwal.
	There are few indications yet that Indians are dissatisfied with the Modi government. In fact, Modi remains India's tallest leader. But it is time for the BJP to recognise that all's not well and that AAP's victory will change Indian politics considerably, much of it to the BJP's detriment, unless it learns its lessons and starts delivering on its commitments. The Indian voter is impatient and is hardly in a mood to wait for long.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Author forgets that Mr. Modi has 12 years of record of performance as successful CM and in last 8 months too, he is performing well as a PM. <br/><br/>
While AK yet needs to prove his delivery as a CM. He failed in first attempt and for second term, yet it is too early that AAP would form government as till result declare, you can't say with 100% surety that AAP would win. <br/><br/>
Delhi if BJP loose, would be learning experience for BJP. BJP did strategically mistakes in campaign specially in last 10 days. Theoretically announcing Bedi's name as CM was perfectly right. After announcing Bedi's name, BJP's popularity serge ahead for first two days. But Bedi's poor oratory's skills cost her image as well as BJP too. Her ran away from TimeNow's interview, interview with Ravish and her speeches at campaign shown her limitation as a orator. During time, AAP surpassed BJP first time in opinion polls. And BJP's daily press conference to attack on AK makes campaign more personality oriented and help AK more. AAP too learned from last year experience, focus on positive campaign only than personalized attack. This helped lot to AAP.<br/><br/>
As fight is tough and neck to neck. Lets wait for final result than commenting on BJP or AAP

                            Sir impatience killed a good government of Ataji. As a result we had to bear the brunt of congress and UPA misrule for 10 years. You are knowledgeable and intellectual. Are you advising people to be impatient. Is it good counselling for the youngsters.  Why in this country we have patience and trust issues always. Why sir people like you are not  taking a lead in changing mindsets rather than telling them to be impatient and want results from a newly elected govt in 7 months.

                            Congratulations to Mr. Harsh for the beautifully analysed and unbiased article. BJP and Mr. Modi must always remember that they have to contend with two very adverse factors, namely, all those so called intellectuals and media who have been beneficiaries under the earlier dispensation for decades and a visibly and increasingly restless and impatient people who voted Modi with great expectations. The first category is waiting to grab every chance to claim that Modi is a failure. The second category needs to be attended as best as possible. Unlike congress, BJP will never get the benefit of decades of time to deliver. But they have to factor in this unfortunate reality.

                            What went wrong with BJP this elctions - 1. No manifesto 2. No poll promises on electricity &amp; water (this is the major factor why AAP got huge support) 3.BJP could not connect to the masses that is the poor people of Delhi ( mostly migrated from other states) 4. Muslim votes after Congress marginalized. 5. Ignoring Harshwardhan as CM candidate ( To counter AK, they needed leader like him where opposition also can not point finger at him). 6. Satish Upadhyay started dreaming of becoming CM ( being state president is not the only qualification required for CM). 7. No clue why did they defer the elections after huge success in May. AK was also marginalized in Varanasi. It was right time to go for kill, which I am sure BJP will always repent this decision. 8. Master stroke of BJP by bringing KB for the top post could not get the anticipated reactions as most of the poor &amp; deprived section of people already made up their mind on the soaps offered by AAP. So KB gets benefit of doubt! <br/><br/>
BJP was no match to AAP's political strategy &amp; campaign. Sure lot to learn for BJP from this election. I hope if AAP comes to power, AK should be very careful of his decisions &amp; acts as Delhi voters spare him next time if he falters on the big promises which are difficult to achieve and it should not come at the cost of tax payers money. So wait &amp; watch the great gamble played by AK which at least give 5 years of power.

Poor Modi, must prove himself everyday, even after 3 terms as CM, must learn from 49 day CM? Rahul Gandhi need not have to learn, Kejriwal need not have to learn, all are born gurus. superb!

                            I feel pity for the masses who got swayed by the big promises by Arvind Kezriwal. Where will he gets the fund from to fulfil his promises. Centre can't afford to sponsor his freebies to Delhites. He will either fund his freebies by spending from funds meant for other projects or he will run away like last time blaming the centre not providing enough money for his freebies. Not many youngsters asked this question from AK. This is similar to Laloo era where overnight he turned loss making railway into profit making institute and nobody asked him how he could achieve that. He went on to present it in IIM-Ahmedabad and Havard University and all intellects were taken for a ride by Laloo and later on it was proved that he manipulated the data.

                            Modi and BJP has been elected to Parliment to Govern India on the basis of his performance in Gujarat and his model of development projected by him. It can not be compared to Mr. Kejeriwal and if he wins Delhi election, let him govern the Delhi with whatever promise he made to the people of Delhi. We can not ask Modi to follow Kejeriwal's example. From his previous 49 days rule, we could be sure, he is also going to be autocratic and not a democratic (this 'not democratic' comment given by his own colleagues who left AAP in the meantime). First he should be there for 5 years to give good rule and get re-elected for his own governance. Then only he can be compared to any other Chief Minister, leave alone Mr. Modi. Request to all bloggers and AAP persons to concentrate on what is in hand rather than advicing Modi

                            @: You are way off the mark. Vajpayee govt was kicked out because India was "NOT SHINING". UPA govt gave us the best 10 year growth rate ever in our history. They lost, because Modi promised to bring back black money, and give all 15 lakhs. Besides, they falsely said that growth was poor, when new statistics say that growth was 6.9% in 13-14. Now BJP is performing poorly. Prices are still increasing, nothing has changed on the ground. That is why delhi has rejected Modi and his govts performance and voted for AAP

                            Dear Mr Pant, don't trigger of your gun in a  hurry about Delhi Results. Even if Exit polls are correct, one thing you need to bear in mind that all Congress votes shifted to AAP which is very evident from the fact that Congress is losing here deliberately  to defeat BJP and prop up Kejriwal for a certain some period. Delhi loss has anything to with BJP strategy, dissent, Kiran Bedi, disillusionment etc .Exit polls are out showing a sweep for AAP and all guns are out now . When People of Gujarath elected MODI for 3 terms I don't think MODI  needs to learn anything from Kejriwal. One loss may slow down the speed of BJP  but MODI &amp; CO. know how to accelerate the speed  at a certain point  of time. This likely loss may be a blessing in disguise for MODI for the upcoming election in Bihar and UP. This is what politics is all about.

The big question is -- from where he get money for such lavishness. clearly his stated income cannot support such lifestyle.

                            Very true...Modi should devote himself totally to governing the country and not waste time in campaigning for the state elections. He was elected to be the prime minister of the country. If the state units of BJP have done well then they will definitely win even without Modi campaigning.

                            Modi should find ways of both short term and long term implementation ways.  He definitely doing his best in the long term, but public is not ready to wait.  Modi has to also introduce some short term fast ways, particularly on those that gives quick public response such as corruption on the lower rung of officials (particularly, police, PR personnel in the government, approvers, etc).  Modi may have to instill some fear and confidence in these lot (in Delhi central secretariat, this might have happened simply because Modi took over, but it has definitely not percolated down in other areas.  India consists of both type of personnel...those who can see long term effects and are ready to wait (this is minority) and those who wants immediate visible results.  Both has to go hand in hand, while Modi's efforts are more leaning on the former.  This is particularly true when opponents such as Kejriwal with mass appeal are still around, playing into the sentiments of these lot.

                            Harsh- good observation but very superficail one. Delhi election was to see if the fragmented  BJP state machinery could functionn and rise above the petty squables and just to proove that who so aggresive election campaign fromthe big boys. The reality is to test who are real committed and decicated work force.<br/>
The results will see many heads roll and many ego bruised. As for Delhi it is a small place to matter in national politics. With AK at helm one can rest be assured that he will never be a national force to reckon with- he has made the folly to promising the electorate the moon and with no budget to support the has a very delicate balancing act for him cut out. He will need teh centres support more than anyone else which if not forth coming will force him to sit on dharnas and to get  it easy he will have to behave well. Both are workable options for BJP. If he resigns then he will have to forget politics- if he accepts then he has to forego UP and Bihar elections. Unless he nominates someone else Ak has won yet lost it.<br/><br/>
India is a vast country of 125+ billion people and vast majority who are illread- ill manerred- hardly national excepting occasional cricket matches where we come together as one. This Majority seeks something for itself and that too without even raising a fingre - they are the true epitome of uruly masses who in  a short span to time get impatient at having not got thier 15 lakhs or upset that PM wears a INR 15 lakhs suit. I pity AK his fate in case he cant hand over the goodies quick and fast. Going by my understanding there are no goodies in the bag forget about quick or fast<br/><br/>

                            People like Kejriwal who are ideological but not at all practical are very dangerous . Bills would be halved how Mr! If organization don't earn profit it would be difficult for the company to sustain itself. Repeated years of loss have made railway sick. The salary employees ten year ago and now are not same. The profit of company pay their salary, PF  and gratuity. Delhi is a small city state he would make the coffers empty the budgetary allocation of centre would not increase for delhi other states have other big projects to be funded,  to met with budgetary shortfall you have to increase indirect taxes. So in one way you are paying. State government cannot audit companies as the discoms are listed in NSE only SEBI can . An IRS officer shoul know that. Get ready for a Singur like situation where everything would be caught in legal tangle increase cost . Also Yamuna river case in water dispute tribunal like Kaveri .Mr Prashant Bhusan s legal fee would increase and he would have a good time.    Have a thought !

                            Mr. Pant if at all AAP wins, which is still in the area of speculation, the only reason will be that he managed to fool a lot of people that he will actually be able to fulfill all those outrageous promises of freebies that he has made. Much is made of the (stupid) decisions he made during his disastrous 49 day rule. None of the freebies announced last time came to pass because they were not provided for...funds were simply not available. People get carried away by freebies announcements. Better run parties are careful in what they promise, because they are national parties and have much more at stake. This anarchist party has no stake in the country's polity.

It stops short of pointing out the inherent contradictions from a naive socialistic approach that AAP advocates. An approach and philosophy that has failed the test of time across the entire world. An approach that promotes state largesse over merit. Punishing hardworking people by making them pay more to build easy conditions for the underprivileged through a subsidy culture leads to the decay of a society.

1. How are you addressing Woman safety? Many rape cases and you seem to be in no hurry to fix things<br/>
2. What infrstructure have you developed? We know how much Vajpayee did.<br/>
3. How have you stopped corruption? You are always throwing ideas. when are you implementing them<br/>
4. When will you bring in Uniform Civil code? <br/>
5. When will you abolish article 370? else apply the same law to all states<br/>
6. When are the investments flowing in?<br/>
7. When do we see transparency in governance?<br/>
8. When are you modernizing the army?<br/>
9. When are you implementing tax reforms?<br/>
10. Nothing is happening then what do you do in the time you are awake? you sleep very less is what i heard.<br/><br/>

Though it is true that most of conversion were inspired by financial benefit, the RSS &amp; VHP must not speak in public.It is a great lesson, BJP,RSS &amp; VHP must learn. <br/>
    Particularly PM Mr.Modi must remember he has to work on development and must reduce the gap of promise and the achievement. Indiscriminate induction of members leads to dispute and dissatisfaction, where the party moves away from the ground reality.<br/>
     Loss in Delhi is not the end of the road, rather a teaching for the BJP that, before it is too late rectify yourselves other wise look at Congress.          Common man looks at price,discipline, law and order and development where he can fit to get his livelihood. All the pseudo-secular babas and all the sadhus must refrain from politics. As a strong supporter, I will like that BJP must maintain strict discipline of the Ministers. Strict and immediate action must be taken against those deviating from the common agenda. Wish all the best for a disciplined, secular and development oriented BJP Party.

                            Nothing to learn,they both are on the same  <br/>
Page.it will take some more time for PM Modi to realise that India is not like Gujarat and a year or two for kejriwal to realise that politics is not for Aam Aadmii. Had it been 50 years later from now,political field could be a option for aam Aadmii,congress did an intelligent job by not playing an active role in Delhi elections there by halting BJP's free run.rest remains to be seen how PM Modi manages from here on.

                            BJP under Modi never governed Delhi so there is nothing to compare and tell Modi to learn from AAP. Secondly, Delhi's problems are not that easy to solve therefore AAP will have to prove what they said can deliver too. Winning an election is not equal to fulfilling people's needs and this holds true for whichever party governs Delhi.

                            Indians, have proved themselves by electing that AK again as CM. Shame indeed. It is a fact that indians neither rule nor can be ruled. Such a bunch of incorrigible people.

                            PM MOdi must learn militant tactics from Kejriwal. Hit and run  - ask questions and never answer any asked of AAP. Make 70 promises , most of which AAP will fail to meet. Lie, lie and lie again and again, until the media is convinced that AAP is doing a fantastic job!

                            The complete shift of congress vote share to AAp has caused this. The BJP vote share is pretty much intact, actually all indications are that it has grown slightly. It was a matter of who can pull larger chunk of congress vote share. If the assembly was dissolved and elections were held in delhi alongside lok sabha BJP would have won with a landslide, as kejriwal was busy in varansi and AAP was in disarray. Strategy and timing as important as anything else and BJP dropped the ball. Now two things can happen. AAP governs so well that it spreads like wild fire and completely substitutes congress in the whole nation, or people hate them so much, because they can't govern, like muslim brotherhood in egypt after arab spring that they are finished.

                            Hello author.you have written beautiful article but jumping to conclusions too soon. Nobody talks about IAC campaign that picked up so well and then flopped. What AAP has done here is same what congress has done with left centric politics. Its just that congress is not credible because ppl know it too well. I want 5 saal kejriwal because I want delhi ppl to know AAP policies and kejri to account for 5 years work instead of 49 day show

                            I fully agree with the author and add further less of self trumpeting, reasonable promises, commitment to fulfil the promises and lastly humble in governance will do lot good to any party in power.The voters have woken up like to see more practical performance.Even to days party is in power because there is no other credible party is available at national level.

                            // NAMOSKAR // YES, MR. HARSH V. PANT IS PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AT KING'S COLLEGE LONDON, HIS PREDICTION IS CORRECT I.E.

YES, LOT OF HURDLES IN EXECUTION OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, MR. ARVIND KERJIWAL WILL FACE IF HE BECOME C.M.

                            AAP showed humility throughout the campaign in sharp contrast to the smug and often arrogant attitude of BJP spokesmen on TV who looked as bad as the old Congress netas. Even their body language was meant to convey their superior status.

                            Good article on NDTV which seems to be not siding with power. Ever since time is measured.. its a fight between RIGHT/truth vs WRONG/false.. aap/ak sided with right/truth (we all have big/small faults) - but the serious/truthful person admits and tries to rectify unlike the wrong/false which becomes arrogant in its falsehood! good to see DELHIITES siding with RIGHT despite odds!

                            Are you labeling Mr Kejriwal a charismatic leader? If yes, you are committing  Himalayan blunder Mr. Pant. Kejriwal is fickle minded person with strange behaviour.  AAP does not have any solid agenda which will take it at the national level. It does not have competent leaders who can really lead and  it seriously lacks having a  strategic think tank.   AAP  is cultivating its crops for mainly  three reasons:<br/><br/>
1. It is living on its past bank balance of Anna movement and in the name of anti corruption issue. The way Kejriwal and his party have collected crores of rupees donations and contributions, these are highly questionable despite their claims of showing transparency.<br/><br/>
2. Voters in Delhi lost complete faith in  Congress. Hence,  Congress votes have gone to AAP because  the voters still want them to give a chance to tackle their daily routine problems as the voters might have thought that 49 days were not sufficient time to prove their worth. <br/><br/>
3. BJP perhaps made a mistake by inducting Kiran Bedi as it CM candidate.  Kiran Bedi has vast experience in administrative set up i.e.  working in bureaucratic environment but she lacks political  leadership skills.  She is also not  a crowd puller. She is too good as casual talker but not a political speech orator like Modi. During her election campaign she was not able to convince the public about solving their problems.  Kejriwal on the hand is a crafty guy, displaying that he is honest and if elected to power, his team will provide a clean  governance.   Mere providing clean governance is not enough, people want development,  they want schemes and programmes to solve the rising problems of a vast populated metropolitan city in which people want  low cost housing,  developed infrastructure to  overcome the congested and traffic problems,   to resolve the sensitive issue of women safety and security, issue of water and power,  growing unemployment etc.  <br/><br/>
 Doe AAP has any definite   plans, programmes and implementation strategies for the above issues or it simply want to stick to its gun of anti corruption slogan.  The story does not end here. Mr Pant slogan se paith nahi bharta..
