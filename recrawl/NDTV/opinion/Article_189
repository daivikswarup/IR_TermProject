Headline::::Modi's Lemming Moment is Here



DateTime::::2015-04-06T13:06:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha)
	There is an enduring myth about the lemming, a rodent which inhabits the Arctic region, that they are prone to mass migration towards the steep cliffs of the Norwegian coast and, following their leader, topple over, one after the other, into the raging sea below. Much like the BJP over the Land Acquisition ordinance.
	The ordinance has been re-promulgated and the BJP is now irretrievably committed to its bizarre lemming-like behaviour, hoping against hope that the nine amendments they have introduced after the debate in the Lok Sabha will exculpate them from the charge of being anti-farmer and pro-corporate.
	 
	It is a vain hope. The amendments are eyewash, designed to buy the support of their own allies, within and without the Sangh Parivar, who have fierce reservations over the course of action that Modi has chosen to take. The amendments do nothing to alter the vicious undermining of the interests of the most discriminated against segment of the Indian population - the kisan and the khet mazdoor. This segment makes up close to 60 per cent of the electorate. It has close ties to their near and dear ones who have migrated to urban slums. Together, they constitute well over three-quarters of all voters. Rural India's share of the economy is, however restricted to 13 per cent of GDP, a decline from about 50 per cent at Independence. That is where they now stagnate, while a tiny sliver of the urban elite corners much of the fruit of faster growth.
	How pathetic is their condition is unveiled in the 2015 Economic Survey, which claims that GDP has registered well over seven per cent growth in the past year of mainly the Modi government, but left agriculture lagging behind at a whisker over 1 per cent.
	Just 1.1 per cent. Even this minuscule one per cent advance masks the fact that while one or two commercial crops have fared relatively well last year, almost all others have registered negative growth.
	 
	For all of Modi's tears and protestations that he knows poverty, the fact is that he is now much better acquainted with the fat cats of industry and infrastructure than he is with the poverty-stricken kisans and khet-mazdoor. While Gandhiji's goal for the nation was to "wipe every tear from every eye", Modi's is to shed copious crocodile tears for the poor while bringing the bright smile to the super-wealthy.
	 
	That is why the principal objective of the 2015 amendment to the 2013 Land Acquisition Act has been to create a "special category" of economic activity that totally exempts these sectors from the two essential provisions of the 2013 Act: one, Social Impact Assessment in consultation with the affected persons and the affected area through the gram sabhas and panchayats, on the basis of which "fair and just compensation" will be determined; and, second, exemption from first securing 70-80 per cent consent of those who will be losing their land before acquisition proceedings are initiated. Modi's amendments exempt "special category" projects from these key requirements. He does not want to give space for affected persons (both land owners and labour losing their employment and livelihood), local communities, local bodies or their elected representatives to have any voice or say in determining whether they should be forcibly deprived of their land, their chattel, their livelihood, their customs, their usages and their integrity as an organic family.
	 
	Chief among the "special category" of exempted economic actives are "industrial corridors" and "infrastructure". For what else does big business want quasi-free land? It wants cut-price land to put up manufacturing units and physical infrastructure. Neither will provide substitute employment or livelihood to those who are being forcibly deprived of their property and the employment derived from working the land. Almost all the benefit will go to those who had nothing to do with the land until it was forcibly acquired.
	Big Business wants to thrive on Governments filching the land from the aam kisan and handing it over to them, so that they get the land dirt cheap and then sell the surplus at hugely inflated prices. The aam kisan is to be compensated at a multiple of the circle price, when everyone knows that four times that bogus rate is not even one-fourth of what the surplus land will fetch when it is resold, as all the evidence shows it will.
	 
	This fundamental exploitation is at the heart of the "special category" that Modi has created to favour his crony capitalist friends. He has covered up his real purpose by adding "affordable housing" to the list of exemptions and started strumming his guitar with the usual chauvinistic appeal to "defence" by placing it among the exempted categories. It won't wash because none other than the Defence Ministry itself had informed the Standing Committee on Rural Development, of which I was a member, that they saw no need to exempt land acquisition for defence industries and defence purposes from the full purview of the 2013 Act. One reason that may have weighed with the Ministry then might have been the fact that nearly 1.5 lakh hectares of land acquired for defence use is lying unutilized with the defence authorities, in some cases going back half-a-century or more!  
	Moreover, "affordable housing" in rural villages rarely requires land acquisition because the housing is built on panchayat land or state government land; in urban areas, "affordable housing" usually comes up in the same location as the jhuggi-jhonpdis. Clearly, Modi's main objective - indeed his sole objective - is land-grabbing to the detriment of the same peasants he claims to be gathering to his bosom so as to flog the land to his corporate moneybags at a fraction of the true market price and at an even smaller fraction of the anticipated rise in land values.
	 
	The kisan is no fool. He knows that it is neither a passionate desire for national defence nor housing for the poor that drives the man. They know that his innocent expression -"special category" - is really aimed at making the rich infinitely richer and gravely depriving the poor to fill party coffers.
	 
	Why is Modi in such a desperate hurry to push through his goals by ordinance and possible by the rarely used parliamentary route of a joint session of both Houses? Is it just to secure the majority that is eluding him in the Rajya Sabha? Or is it the fundamental plank of his programme of thrusting the "Gujarat model of development" on the whole of this hapless country?
	 
	The key to the Gujarat model was rampant land acquisition to pass on land to the private sector at throwaway prices. A classic case was in Kutch where some 1,500 acres were acquired by Chief Minister Modi and passed on to his favourite corporate house, who used a small portion of the land for their own use, and held on to the remainder to sell at a market price that was around 200-300 times the rate at which it was allotted to them. Another example was at the Special Industrial Zone in Hazira, where one of India's major construction companies received land at a discounted price that was zero point something of the rate at which micro-industries subsequently secured land in the same special industrial zone. (The above estimates have been obtained from knowledgeable articles in the prestigious academic publication, The Economic & Political Weekly, Mumbai).
	 
	Particularly worth noting is that a huge portion of land was acquired by Modi's Gujarat government from tribal populations. According to figures supplied by the erstwhile Planning Commission in its Twelfth Plan documents, whereas tribal people constitute only 8 per cent of the state's population, 76 per cent of those dispossessed and displaced were Gujarat's unfortunate tribals. No wonder they massively voted against him. Alas, their share of the electorate was so small that such mass deprivation did not result in electoral losses for so callous a government.
	 
	Modi, therefore, decided that the centre-piece of his economic "reforms" programme would be to transpose the "Gujarat model" to all of India. Hence the tearing hurry to take the ordinance route and, failing its endorsement in the Upper House, deploy the NDA's brute majority in a joint session of both Houses. There are contra-indications from the ground.
	Many of his allies and all of the Opposition are up in arms against this outrage. So are the bulk of the 60 per cent of the electorate directly adversely affected. Gujarat is not India. Compared to most of the densely -populated states of the country, there are large tracts of arid dryland and wasteland in Gujarat that can be forcibly taken over without effective political opposition. Also, Gujarat's forests are available for exploitation by any ruler as ruthless as Modi.
	 
	But India is not Gujarat. When multi-cropped agricultural land is taken over, Modi is quite wrong in thinking he can ride roughshod over protesting kisans. Moreover, a united Opposition will come to the rescue of the deprived kisan and khet-mazdoor wherever and whenever there is takeover of rich agricultural land (which was prohibited under the 2013 Act). They will have to face the electoral consequences - particularly in UP and Bihar where the national destiny is crucially determined.
	The newly-minted Janata Parivar is waiting in the wings to win back the states it lost to Modi in 2014. And a newly-minted Congress, immediately after its Rahul-led rally on 19 April against the land acquisition amendments, will lend its might and weight to the cause of the kisan against the depredations of the merchants of disaster.
	This is the BJP's lemming moment. The countdown to the end of Modi's achche din has begun.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Let us have all agriculture and tribal land. No industries only retrospective taxes. We will wear leaves to hide our private parts and jump like monkeys on tribal land along side tribals. Tree sheds can be perfect toilets as we beg for PDS food that is rotting. Say goodbye to all employment and growth. Welcome to future. Long live socialism and populism.

                            There are lemmings and there are morons.  Aiyar falls into the latter category.  His morbid hatred for Modi is matched only by his morbid fascination and sycophancy to that dreadful parivar which had reigned supreme in India since the ouster of the British.  While every sentence of Moron Aiyar's blog can be rebutted, just a few facts will put paid to this character's attempt at being the font of all knowledge when it comes to protecting the interests of 'kissans and khet-mazdoors'.  Although this segment of society forms a majority of the population, its contribution to the GDP of India is miniscule.  Yet, this segment too has to be educated, has to be housed, has to be fed, and has to have its health needs catered for.  A subsistence farmer owning or ploughing an acre of land and having a family of 10 to support, cannot possibly make a decent living and those of his children who will inherit the land will divide that tiny piece of land into several even smaller plots.  All these plots will have to support large families.  There is no such concept as 'job security', pension provision and up-liftment of living standards.  Wouldn't a steady job in the manufacturing sector help in such a situation? Wouldn't an education in a college built on that land help?  These simple facts are 'no brainners' but then again a moron, who Aiyar is, was always lacking in the grey matter section of his miserable body.  If he had any grey cells, he would have been saying that had India been self sufficient in arms manufacturing, the Borfors scam would not have been possible and his hero Rajiv Gandhi would not have been a billionaire on the backs of the poor Indian 'kissans and khet mazdoors'!  As for the Rahul-led rally on 19 April; well, since the deaths of stalwart comedians such as Jhonny Walker, Mehmood and Keshto Mukerji, India is in dire need of a replacement.  Who better than Rahul?  I am not sure if Aiyar will join this rally; he is, after all, an integral part of every Pakistani TV studio and may well be occupied in Track 2 diplomacy which most of us recognise as stabbing India in the back.

                            Dear MSA- I still remember having read in 1980s a center page article in THE HINDU news paper titled some what as "Norwaygian Lemmings and Congress" The gist of the article was how the party's leaders suicidal faith in the leadership of  members of Nehru-Gandhi dynasty is destroying the party. Even after decades the party leaders have not changed a pint. They are content with obediently following dynasty leader like lemmings. This behavior has brought the congress to a pitiable dismal state.

He is self-proclaimed, legitimate truth teller to this world. Nothing wrong  being a critic of Modi but making a profession out of it is taking it too far. I am amazed to see an intelligent person like Mani wasting his time and energy on so much negativity about our countries Prime Minister. Shame on you Mani, you need to grow up. Become more tolerant. At best your comments can only be termed as sheer jealousy and desperation.

                            As per 2011 statistics India has 15,74,000 square kilometers of arable land second only to USA (1602,000) ; and more than Russia (1215000) and China (1116,000). However. in for food production we are lagging far behind US and China. The need of the hour is to improve food production technologies so as to produce more from less land. Land is required for all the sectors to progress, be it industrial, agriculture, infra, housing, social,etc. To deny land to one sector in order to protect another will create over all imbalance and stagnation of growth. While irrigated, fertile and multi-crop land should be reserved for agriculture, fallow, Banjar, degraded, un-irrigated land should be allowed to be acquired by Govt at reasonable market rates for various purposes. Congress and other opposition parties are using farmers' sentiment to further their political fortunes. Afer Nandigram episode no industrialist is willing to  to invest in West Bengal. Let it not spread to other states, after all India needs industries, infra,etc to create jobs and national wealth.

                            Merchants of disaster? Sounds suspiciously like Maut ka Saudagar? You have to hand it to Aiyer. He is a faithful camp follower of the Parivar. The Italian Parivar that is. And glad to know that Rahul Baba is expected back by 19th April to lead his dejected troops into battle. The modern Don Quixote? Well, well. Considering the results whenever he has led them, this is one battle that Modi will be eagerly looking forward to. The results will be predictable. One more harakiri. I must admit that I have started missing Aiyer's column whenever he takes a longish break, probably to pay obeisance to his gods. It must be said that Modi's government may be long on development and other governance parameters, but it is woefully short on entertainment. Those guys are too serious. Reading Aiyer is the best way to get a full belly laugh. That too free of cost. If he is trying to use his sycophantic column to burrow his way back into the favour of his gods, then all I can say is keep it up. It keeps the rest of us happy as well. All I can tell Aiyer is that the People have Spoken. And they have spoken loud and clear. Hear that voice. Modi has.

                            "Following their leader, topple over, one after the other, into the raging sea below". This is Mani shankar's statement. Wow, this is what you congress slaves did by following  Sonia Maino and Raul Maino in 2015 elections.  Look at your own face in the mirror you bootlicker of congress.<br/>
Atleast now, grow up and say there are many leaders who are born in Bharath and capable of leading the congress party. <br/>
Otherwise, get ready for Congress-mukth Bharath very shortly.

                            Aiyar is accusing Modi's Gujarat government a corrupt one.  Why there wasn't a case filed against him?  He came out clean whatever he had to face.<br/>
Add all the corruption/scam/scandals of BJP governments and compare them with some of Congress and their Allies; then you will know the truth.<br/><br/>
About Land acquire bill:<br/>
We need Industries to stay competitive; wherever you build them, it may impact some.  If you want zero impact, you need to build them in a desert.  So, BJP govt is trying to balance and help the industries grow.  Congress hasn't come out of defeat shock; as it keeps retrospecting it will lose more because of its leaders.

                            To call the bluff of Sri MSA, I did some research on Google and found the following SC judgement.In fact Congress state govt in Gujrat allotted land at much lower price earlier for industries. Another point MSA does't mention is it was the marshy land (low lying along the coast that was allotted to Adanis.It required investment to develop and use it for intended purposes. <br/><br/>
Supreme Court upholds 1,000 acre land allocation to Adani SEZ<br/>
NDTV | Updated On: October 31, 2012 09:57 (IST)<br/><br/>
The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the Gujarat government's decision to allocate 1,000 acres of land in Mundra for development of a special economic zone (SEZ) by Adani Port and Special Economic Zone, and dismissed a special leave petition challenging the allocation.<br/><br/>
A division bench comprising Justice K. S. Radhakrishnan and Justice Dipak Misra dismissed the petition filed by residents of Zarpara village and few members of its 'gram panchayat' on grounds of lack of merit and refused to overrule the Gujarat High Court's judgement dated June 22, 2011.<br/><br/>
The bench observed that the Gujarat government was statutorily empowered to allocate the land and declined the petitioner's request for allocation of an alternate 1,000 acre pastoral wasteland to the Zarpara 'panchayat'.<br/><br/>
The Gujarat government had allotted 1,000 acres of pastoral land at Zarpara to Adani Port and SEZ in 2007. However, this allocation was challenged in the Gujarat High Court via multiple public interest litigations, which were dismissed on June 22, 2011.<br/><br/>
The petitioners then approached the Supreme Court alleging that the land allotment was illegal and arbitrary and had disturbed the ratio of cattle to pastoral land in the village as prescribed by the state government.<br/><br/>
Adani Ports and SEZ contested these allegations and stated that the allotment was legal.

                            The 'lemming' comparison applies incredible to te Congress of today, following a dynasty that can do no wrong. Mani must open his eyes and read what he writes, and he will surely cringe. The way the Congressmen, and yes, the AIADMK stalwarts fall at the feet of their leaders is beyond belief.<br/>
The rest of what he has written is his usual 'see-no-good-in-Modi' stuff. The BJP, good or bad, has done more than the UPA in the last 5 years they were in power. UPA did NOTHING for farmers, so now they have re-discovered the slogan of the Late Sri Lal Bahadur Shastri, "Jai Jawan Jai Kisan".<br/>

                            Mr Mani - If you haven't realized, Congress was in power for 58-60 yrs out of 67 years since independence. That means Congress has to take 85% of responsibility and blame for the mess we are in. We are still called as 'Third World country' by developed world. Ask this question to yourself or RaGa and i am "confident" that you will still blame 7-8 year rule of BJP/others...

                            If you believe MSA, then everything which is not congress is BAD, STUPID and LEMMING LIKE. But before I begin believing MSA, I would like a few clarifications: (1) If your party was so GOOD then why did it lose so badly; (2) Does congress have a monopoly on lemming like behaviour wherein they blindly and deafly and mutely follow their leader provided he or she belongs to the Nehru Gandhi dynasty (people remember the times of Sitaram Kesari and P.V.Narasimha Rao); (3) Is the congress ready to take the blame for the state in which our country is in; (4) How do you face your family after writing such drivel, or is it that they don't count as long as the Nehru Gandhi family is happy; (5) How is it that the relations with Pakistan were never on friendly footing although your wise, intelligent, articulate and patriotic party was at the helm for almost 60 years since independence; (6) Hope you will accept our request to continue writing as your blog is one sure shot writing which provides a much needed comic relief after a lot of day today tensions. Tell you what your are better than any stand up comic who make an effort to make people laugh. You don't even have to make any effort, the moment public reads your name they are prepared for a whale of a time.

The crony-capitalistic development model may not work for a country as vast and diverse as India...India may be a developing country but she has a character - even in poverty and sufferings Indians can stand to their dignity and not lose their wisdom...hope we are not carried away by "Acche din" chants and fall prey to politicians' fooling tactics !!

                            The farmers in India are not committing suicides because their land has been grabbed. They are neck deep in debt, no party seems to be bothered about the private money lenders squeezing the farmer dry, nor about measures to improve agricultural output with a more minimum of land and guaranteed irrigation and fertilizer or pesticide prices, nor about an agriculture insurance. We in our country cannot afford to have 60% of people in agriculture and aim to be a financial superpower tomorrow. Idiots like Mani will not realise that, whereas Modi seems to. Only thing he should come up with a spate of pro-kisaan reforms.

                            Typical Mani Shankar Aiyar article: full of slander and half truths. Sample this:<br/><br/>
"...the Special Industrial Zone in Hazira, where one of India's major construction companies received land at a discounted price that was zero point something of the rate at which micro-industries subsequently secured land in the same special industrial zone."<br/><br/>
Given that the 'major construction company' spent tens of crores on building industrial infrastructure, one would logically assume that they'll have to lease out the land at a much higher rate to recover the cost and make a decent profit. Perhaps Mr. Aiyar lives in a parellel universe where there's no inflation and companies do not look to recover investment or make a profit.

If you are so worried about kisan and khet, and if you really personally did an iota of work for them, what explains you even losing deposit in 2014 elections from your own home constituency? Congress is the biggest scam of the past two centuries. Just knowing good english and writing articles without credentials to back yourself is what made you take the backdoor entry to the Parliament, while Modi walks in through the front door everyday.

                            Mr. Mani Shankar Iyer, what is the average holding for the poor farmer and what is the expected annual income per acre? People talk about a farming profit of Rs 20000-30000 / acre. A poor farmer owning 2 acres of farmland can earn only less than Rs 60000 per year. is this enough for a middle class living. Food can be imported. Industrialization can provide sustainable employment to farm labour and small farmers, not false promises and doles. <br/>
Why are you misleading people with your fairy tales?

                            Mani starts with a "myth" and continues with a series of "myth"s. He talks about Gujrat model now when Modi is no longer CM and Gujrat has relected him thrice and given a clean sweep in the general elections.<br/><br/>
As a politician, it is very logical and rational for Modi to do what has helped him in the past and if Mani thinks this will be bad and a majority of the electorate will not be happy all he has to do is sit back for the remaining 4 years 2 months and come elections they will reelect Congress right?<br/><br/>
Between independence and 2013 the British law was used, if it was so bad obviously the previous Congress governments run by family members should have notice it right? Talking about fat cats, how does Robert Vadra acquire land in congress ruled states and efficiently get their purpose changed? Though I must say it is very disappointing that these allegations were made at least more than 2 years ago and no action has been taken by the BJP government which is similar to the Gujrat riots taking place in 2002 and the Congress government from 2004 - 2014 not being able to convince a court of Modi's guilt but talking on television as if it is an open and shut case.

                            Mr Iyer, pls take note. Beyond a point, criticism becomes obnoxious and nauseating. Wish you showed the same zeal in commenting on your Govt as well. You get well soon

                            It is not out of place to request Sri MSA to write about the genuineness of land and iron ore mines allotted by YS Raja Shekar Reddy their party's CM in AP during 2004-2009. More than 8000 acres were allotted to his favourites Vanpik, Indu Aranya group, Matrix,etc. Now all these allotments were cancelled and or attached by ED under Money laundering act.

                            Sham! Criticism is important but there is thick line between criticsm and hatred. For all the shit you write Mr Mani, atleast tell us for what the hell you went to meet hurriyat leaders on pakistan national day in pakistan embassy.
