Headline::::More Questions Than Answers From Rahul Gandhi's Sunday Noon Show



DateTime::::2015-04-20T02:06:00+05:30




                                (Ashok Malik is a columnist and writer living in Delhi.)
Rahul Gandhi's comeback event at the Congress' "farmers' rally" in Delhi this afternoon was not so much to prove to the Indian voter that he could lead the country. It was to tell the Congress worker that he has it in him to run the party.
With his mother, Sonia Gandhi, now close to 70, a generational change in the Congress is on the anvil. Rahul, as Congress vice-president, is likely to be the next Congress president. However, in recent weeks many senior Congress politicians, including Amarinder Singh and Shiela Dikshit, both former chief ministers, have suggested a succession be postponed indefinitely and Sonia stay put.
To be fair, there is no competition between mother and son. Sonia and Rahul are on the same page and are far from being factional rivals. However, the point is substantial sections of the party don't quite trust Rahul's instincts, judgement and ability to manage a complex political situation. If Rahul was attempting to change their minds today, after his 56-day holiday, he didn't quite pull it off.
A modern political meeting is a televised spectacle. It is as much about theatre as about substance. Rahul's limitations as an orator became apparent soon enough. What is more, so did his inability to stick to a coherent line and train of thought.
While his mother is no fiery orator either, her speech was much sharper and much more disciplined. It focused on the subject at hand - the plight of Indian farmers and how the Narendra Modi government's amendments to the Land Acquisition Act of 2013 would apparently hurt agriculturists. In contrast, Rahul's speech was all over the place. If a Congress worker had to choose his immediate leader solely on the basis of those two speeches, he would deliver a simple message to Rahul: Let's keep Mum.
In some senses, Rahul seems not to have recovered from the defeat of 2014. Listening to him, there was this inescapable feeling that he was in a time warp. It was not helped by the fact that he referred repeatedly to his experience of visiting drought-hit farmers some years ago. The crowd he was addressing was of north Indian farmers worried by a spell of unseasonal rain that has damaged a crop ripe for harvesting.
His mother, in her speech, took care to recall the unseasonal rain and the labour of harvesting, which the farmers had set aside to attend the political meeting. Did she have a better speech writer or simply better political judgement?
Rahul may as well have given this speech in April 2014, in the midst of the Lok Sabha election campaign. He has not moved on. He referred to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme, the write-off of farmers' loans, his excursions to Bhatta Parsaul (Uttar Pradesh) and Niyamgiri (site of a Vedanta bauxite mining project and aluminium plant that Rahul and the UPA government thwarted). He announced these as his - and the UPA's - exemplary deeds. This was all very well, but it was yesterday's story. It was voted upon, one way or the other, in 2009 and 2014.
Indeed, in Kalahandi (the parliamentary constituency of which Niyamgiri is a part), Bhakta Charan Das, the sitting Congress MP, finished a distant third in 2014. One interpretation of this was that while a few hundred people wanted the mining project blocked, many thousand more saw benefit in industrialisation. If there was a learning here for Rahul and the Congress, it was obviously lost on the Congress vice-president.
Clearly, popular positions in Niyamgiri and Kalahandi were not as cut and dry as Rahul claimed they were.
The wider issue is Rahul was and is still expected to shape a platform for the future, and for the period leading up to the 2019 election. This platform cannot simply be an iteration of the initiatives and achievements, such as they were, of the UPA government, especially in the 2009-14 period. The platform's elements have to be forward-looking and contemporary. Where does Rahul stand on this?
The Congress has little idea.
In the weeks to come, there are mundane challenges for Rahul to tackle. His engagement with mass politics cannot be limited to guest appearances at stage-managed (pun intended or otherwise) party jamborees. His associates say he will take to the roads in Bihar and then other states; he has to prove he has the stomach to sustain it.
That apart, who will coordinate with non-BJP parties in Parliament as the debate and possible vote on the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill comes up? Who will take a call on the Congress' choice of chief ministerial candidate in Punjab? Who will negotiate with Laloo Yadav and Nitish Kumar, as the Congress seeks a junior role in the emerging anti-BJP alliance in Bihar? Who will sort out the civil war in the Assam Congress?
Will it be the mother or the son? Does Rahul have it in him to do any of these?

                            The questions Malik raises are far too complicated for RaGa to understand, let alone answer.  This is a character who EXPECTS things to be handed to him on a plate.  He is doing what he does because he feels entitled.  Why else, when India is looking at performance in this digital age, get Kharge to lead Congress in Parliament?  Why have flunkies such as jayram Ramesh even accompany him to meetings?  Does not this 44 year old have any confidence in himself?  All in all, a poor communicator, a poor performer, lazy, lacking in intellect and still totally dependent on flunkies to do his bidding.  Come the next election, Congress will take a further hammering and only then will voices be raised against this excuse for a politician!

                            Out of at least 20 crore supporters and a history of more than 100 years, does Congress have no one but an Italian Maid and her son to lead them ? If Congress loves dynasty so much, they should have left the freedom struggle to Bhagat Singhs, Azads, Bose, etc. They took credit for India's freedom and democracy only to supplant it with Nehru-Gandhi Dynasty. THE GAME IS UP! CONGRESS IS DONE ... as it should have been, right after Independence as per Gandhiji's wish.

                            After pathetic Farmer's Rally, If still Congress wants to continue with more such cartoon shows to revive its fortune. I seriously doubt about its efficacy. Rahul Gandhi is  a failed politician the fact has been proved more than once in last 10 years. If Congress wants to cling to him , the end of congress is near and for sure.

                            @:rightly pointed . they used  the sacrifice of the great freedom fighters and claimed freedom struggle and still the congress party is claiming . shame on them<br/>
and at least kick them out . All true congress leaders who sacrificed have gone but one wonders how sonia claiming that she fought for freedom struggle and she the funniest part is the useless present congress leaders to be ashamed to hear from sonia about the freedom struggle. The congress party insulted the bharat people and still insulting the country. kick them out , once rejected .. gone

                            All this Drama about Land Bill and Farmer's plight is for saving the Land Looted by Senior Congress Politicians in the last 10 years including Hooda and Vadra. If Rahul and/or his family, starting from Nehru are so worried about farmers, then why the farmers are still dependent upon the vagaries of nature ? Simple answer is that Nehru dynasty just see the farmers as their Vote Bank just Like they see Muslims as their Vote Bank.

                            Pappu was PM of our country from last 10 years (of course without responsibility!, indirectly). Imagine how much internal information he may have on our security, economy etc....So it is a big concern for ppl if he just disappears and nobody knows where he is.

                            Are we not spending far more time and energy on something irrelevant. I mean all news channels are flooded with anointing this person. He was away from action for 2 months. Suddenly he comes and delivers speech for farmers. Guys we need to be sensible as well. Just don't oppose or support someone for the sake of doing it. When will this torture stop? Regards, Yogesh

                            Let us find a way to separate jhumlas from truth if there is any. After all we all got cheated by the 15 lakh in to your account promise. When Jan dhan yo jana came we thought money is going to gl I will in to it. Now they casually dismiss it off as jhumla. Is it not cheating each and every citizen personally?<br/>

                            Malik and like minded writers had written off Rahul after the last elections and they were in a jolly ride once Rahul left without notice. Now all of a sudden after Rahul's speech, all are trying to suggest what Rahul should do and not do etc., Why is this sympathy all of a sudden or is it a kind of insecurity as they see Rahul emerging as a big force. BJP sympathisers, forget about Rahul and mind your business. Congress will uproot you soon with the kind of anti poor and anti farmer policies adopted by BJP.

                            A vibrant democracy needs a strong and a balanced opposition party, which can offer an alternative. The erstwhile Congress model was tried for 10 years and found to be woefully wanting. perhaps the voters expected a return to PV Narasimha Rao's era of economic development. Some parts were shown in UPA I but UPA II was a singular disaster. The GoP of India needs to rgroup itself, not just for its followers but for the sustenance of Indian Democracy. For this, unfortunately they have to look beyond the Nehru-Gandhi family. Sonia's distinct crony socialism in UPA II with her NAC did the damage to Congress in the 2014 elections, wherein people have rejected their model outright. RaGa is a disaster in the making. Need a breathe of fresh air in the Congress. Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka should step aside and let someone else emerge from the churning.

                            This write-up exposes the 'perception' of one who has no high opinion of a young leader of 130-years old "GRAND OLD PARTY",which has ruled over India 54 years out of 68 years after independence!It was NOT in one stretch but in 4(four) spells from 1947 to 1977;from 1980 to 1989;from 1991 to 1996 and after along break of 8(eight) years, in coalition with others from 2004 to 2014!Incidentally,every time it has succeeded a govt.run by Party,in which BJS/BJP had been  allied or supported from outside<br/>
In the recent LS polls it is "down but NOT out!BJP's vote share has been 31% and it got 282 seats!Congress share was 19.3% but could get only 44 seats!<br/>
Mahatma Gandhi championed the cause of Champaran indigo growers in 1917 and made Congress a national party which wrested freedom from British imperialists in 1947!Its loyal workers and sympathisers are always with it.<br/>
So the supporters of ruling party must not ridicule Congress, on the other hand,<br/>
 report to the rulers about ground realities so as to shape their policies appropriately!

Who cared Rajiv? until his mom passed away? So, its time mother decides what she wants.
