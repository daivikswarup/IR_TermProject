Headline::::Letter from Pakistan: My Country Shrieks in Pain



DateTime::::2014-12-16T21:45:00+05:30




                                (Mehr Tarar is former Op-ed Editor, Daily Times, Pakistan)I drop my son to school every morning. I have been doing it for the last 13 years, and I do it even now when he's almost 15. As he steps out of the car with a bright smile, I blow Ayat-ul-Kursi on him, watching him enter the school gate. I worry about his safety without even being aware that I worry about his safety. No, it's not because I feel unsafe in Pakistan, but because he is the most precious person in the world to me, and until I see him back with me, I feel a part of me is not there. Today, I feel as if I have been punched in my stomach. In my heart. And in my soul. With an iron rod. As I hear of children who were killed in an Army school in Peshawar, I feel my heart stopping. Children were shot in the face. Children were shot in the head. Children were dragged out from under the chairs, under the tables, and shot. At point blank. Methodically. Coldly. Clinically. They - who go by the name of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan - say it is to avenge the Army operation against them in the FATA. To avenge the deaths of militants who were wreaking havoc on innocent Pakistanis in myriad acts of terror. It's retribution, they say. I have nothing to say here. You call yourself a Muslim, you call your fight a jihad, you call your way that of Allah. And yet you do what Allah forbids you to do: to perpetrate a war in His name where you kill children. Where you kill people who have never harmed you. You are not just Pakistan's enemy but you are also your own worst enemy. Before a court penalizes you, before the bullet of a soldier kills you, you will die a thousand deaths. The screams of the children you killed today, the wails of the parents whose children you killed today, the pain of the nation whose young you killed today will not let you be in peace. Until you die.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

Then the similar is what Pakistan Army has been doing. They call themselve Muslim, they say they support Kashmir Jehad and of cource they call it Allah way....Have guts and address the root cause in Pakistan first. Taliban might have appeared after 1980's but your Army appeared before them

This happened largely because of your government. Your government has harbored, shielded and nurtured these terrorists for a long time now just because they can wage a proxy war against us. Now that your government has abandoned them for the greed of few billion American dollars in aid, they have become your new enemy. Fix your home Pakistan, before it's too late!!

                            Ms. Tarar - your country cannot be supporting terrorists it likes (Hafeez Saeed - killer of 160 innocent civilians in Mumbai) and escape the wrath of terrorists it does not like. Ask your government to renounce terrorism in all forms and shape and the world will be with you in fighting these animals who eat their young.

                            Whilst one can appreciate the sentiments of Mehr Tarar, one  needs to realise through the language used how the people have been encaged in the prison of islam and devoid of a scientific approach to view the world. One cannot separate between religion and terrorism, as terrorism (in this case) is but a stem of islam. Pakistan's political, social, cultural and media space is dominated by islam which its venal military led elites use as the glue in the hope to bind an historic mistake and a failed state.<br/>
Pakistan desperately needs de-islamisation. It can start by withdrawing loudspeakers from mosques a source of environmental/noise pollution, state control of islamic seminaries and most importantly the nurture of the ability to view the world through the lens of reason. A very tall order indeed !

                            Your foreign minister Aziz says, there are bad terrorists like the one's killing people inside Pak and then there are good terrorists, like the one's who killed people in Mumbai on 26/11. Are the lives of Indians not important? By the way not all Indians are Hindus to hate all Indians, we know you have a built-in DNA to hate Hindus.

                            This is no different than 26/11  terrorist and many such attacks on india from Pakistan sponsored terrorists. Who will wipe tears of mothers who lost theirs sons, daughters? In the court, Der hai per Andher nahi. I have said many times at different forum&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Evil has never been defeated in conventional ways. Time has come to stop fooling ourself with expressions like:  all religions are same; Islam is religion of peace, terrorist has no religion. We need to take unconventional approaches to defeat. First we have to accept that one particular religion has become terrorist producing factory. All Muslims who prefer to be called moderate should stand up and question teachings of Islam and make necessary changes.

                            It's such a cliche. Pakistani shout loud for their own death by their own monsters. But not a single Pakistani said similar things when it's our people who die<br/>
They become mujahideen or jihadi or freedom fighter? You people should take a action against govt which wants to talk to ttp. Or army which talk of good n bad terrorist. Or ISI which talk of covert operation. <br/>
Yes I feel pain of these kids and for my country.i promise we stand with you. But please introspect. Let's finish them all . A good terrorist is a dead terrorist.<br/><br/>
May lord rip their soul. I wish strength for all mother and father who lost or found their kids injured.

                            What happened today was a tragedy and should be condemned. But the bigger truth is, you reap what you sow. Who created the Taliban? What is CIA and ISI role in creating them to fight Russians in Afghanistan? Who is funding them? How come terrorists are able to conduct open drives to fund across the cities of Pakistan? These are questions people need to ask the Government of Pakistan and it's army and ISI.

1) I feel pained at the loss of innocent life, let it be kids, men or women.<br/>
2) Where were your tears and pain, when your very own cowardly attack on Mumbai,India. who were sent by ISI and Hafeez.<br/>
3) TTP claims that it is revenge for there's own killing..it looks like Pakistan Army Killed innocent kids and family members of these militants.<br/>
4) Hopefully, Pakistan stops exporting the terror..to other country and learns...the monster it created and started feeding there own children.

                            In India, most people believe that this is the only way Pakistan will let the rest of the world stay in peace....by turning their guns on each other. Almost all governments  want to be politically correct and not name this as Islamic Terrorism when in fact there is no other way to describe it. The entire Pakistani society is beset with a fundamentalist mindset. This is not going to change. So, pray keep yourselves busy. You have neither my condolences nor my jeers at this havoc created by your own Frankensteins. So make merry with your Jihads, shell out your Fatwas, deal with your blasphemies. Whatever it takes to keep you occupied. Just stay away from us. It is the only way the civilised world feels safer. When you guys are at each other's throats.

                            Hello Author, <br/><br/>
I am horrified at these cowardly attacks on innocent children by terrorists. The terrorists are cowards won't spare anyone not even children to spread fear in society. I really pray that everyone in Pakistan musters courage and resolve to put behind this insane event and unite to fight the perpetrators. <br/><br/>
However please realize this situation is a culmination of a carefully nurtured terrorist force by your own government and military authorities to initially please western countries and then bleed India, your authorities never really cared for the people and wanted to become wealthy (really wealthy by world standards) with dirty money from the west. Politicians and Generals are to be blamed alike, they kept quoting a 1000 yr old Muslim ruling history and indoctrinated a sense of enmity in the people towards all their neighbors and fooled largely illiterate Pakistani people who can't think beyond their next meal. This worked well for a few decades in favor of the Politicians and Generals whereas the largely illiterate people were made to feel content with a false sense of Muslim ruling supremacy and off course not to mention about conquering Kashmir.<br/><br/>
Little did these Politicians and Generals realize that the same terrorist force they nurtured will turn their ugly head at them and will strive to establish their rule as opposed to the Rawalpindi elite, simple logic why should the terrorist work hard and let Rawalpindi rule and get wealthy? I think you probably got the drift of what I am trying to communicate<br/><br/>
I mentioned earlier unite and fight the perpetrators, what does it mean ? It means live within your means and pickup just fights that you can legitimately win, attempting to bully nations much larger than yours for no reason will be drain on your resources, people and society. Shun Rawalpindi politics and support institutions to give democracy a real chance. Never please anyone especially the west and Rawalpindi who corrupt your society and lastly don't treat you neighbors as enemies

                            Excruciating as this event might be, it is unlikely to change the Pakistan military policy of supporting these elements.<br/>
(1) It is not possible to support Taliban in Afghanistan, give them shelter and room to operate in Pakistan, and simultaneously declare war on Taliban elements operating in Pakistan.<br/>
(2) It is hypocritical for the Pakistan army to criticize this event and simultaneously plot, support, execute and support similar events in India and Afghanistan.<br/>
It is wishful thinking but if Pakistan army can mend its way and give up its jihadi mindset, India and Pakistan can have a productive partnership. This approach can do wonders for this neighborhood, but  will reap the most benefit for the people of Pakistan. Realistically, I don't see it happening in my lifetime.

                            Mehr Tarar,let me just refresh ur memories for the crimes ur PAK ARMY has committed.When the Pakistan Army sends militants to kashmir,who have butchered our soldiers,orphaned so many children,killed their parents in front of them...u called that a war on KASHMIR LIBERATION.When Pak Army went and raped Bangladeshi Women,killed nearly 3 million Bangladeshis when they were fighting for BANGLADESH LIBERATION, you called that betrayal on the part of East Pakistan and blamed India for Pakistan's Division. Pak Army forced the KARGIL war upon India and for that too they blamed India saying Kashmir freedom fighters were involved in the war.But later on u were forced to accept that ur Army was responsible. When Mumbai was attacked, u were the same people who again blamed India for that and did not accept that your country was involved in the attacks. Those terrorists killed a Jewish Parent in front of their child. How do u feel about this?? In all these attacks YOUR country was involved. We all feel really sorry for the parents who lost their children. We don't laugh when our neighbor is in sorrow...We are Indians.Today I do not know whether I should feel sad bcoz my country was cut into pieces in 1947...or I should feel happy that a cancerous part was removed for a healthier future of my country

                            May the tender souls rest in peace!... The whole thing is such inhuman and cowardly act that i have no words to describe what i feel like. Time for the whole Muslim community to stand up along with people of other religion to fight against such acts unitedly. <br/>
In my view acts such as these have no religion and Muslims should speak openly about it and express their feelings on a larger platform. <br/>
killing any innocent irrespective of which ever religion/caste/creed he belongs to is going dead against the principles of Islam.<br/>
May allah punish these morons in such a manner that it should be a lesson to all others who even think about getting involved in such activities.

We all make mistakes and not always right, that one thing right there is what puts Pakistan in a different league and most impartial persons around the world will agree to that more or less.

                            terrorism has no religion. how can anyone target innocents like this? it's shocking. I hope India and Pakistan honestly come together to fight terrorism and look beyond personal politics. Indian or Pakistan everyone wants peace and safety for their families.

                            You will be in continuous pain if your country keeps on harbouring the likes of Hafiz Sayeed, Masood, Dawood and negotiate on behalf of hijackers of Kandahar.  Your pain will be more than us if you do not hear what the world is saying.  There will be pain if you close your eyes to the evidence given by other countries.  Your shrieks will not be heard after some time if the terror factories are not shut immediately.  There will be more shrieks if you jail someone for 33 years for helping in the elimination of Osama.  This is what happens when you call terrorists as freedom fighters.  What has Pakistan achieved by closing its eyes and brains.

                            Unless you come to terms with the fact that all Pakistani Politicians, the ISI, the Pakistani Army are hand in gloves with extremist groups, they survive and subsist on spreading hatred against other countries (especially India), the situation can't improve.<br/><br/>
Take lessons from history - nobody gains by sponsoring terror. The U.S. has been funding terrorists for ages to serve their own means - they created Taliban to go against USSR, they created Saddam to have control over Iran , they created ISIS to win over Syria  - it always backfires. <br/><br/>
All these indirect means of warfare never work. And unless you change your attitude and mass protest against the politicians, the army and the ISI- to change their modus-operandi, these incidents of violence will only get worse.<br/><br/>
Along with mourning, please take preventive action.

Dear Mehr please search"2002 Kaluchak massacre"(this is only an example, there are multiples of them). Terrorists killed 10 children there in J&amp;K. You will see that India has already witnessed number of terror attack like Peshawar. Please initiate steps to change the paradigm in your country and perhaps of whole Islamic world, some miscreants have hijacked the idea of Islam. This is called Karma. Please awake and see whole world as a third person, you will realize intolerance is the root of everything.

No they are not brothers and sisters of INdians and we never saw pakistanis saying  we are with indian brothers and sisters when 1993 mumbai blasts,  then train blasts and then mumbai attacks happened. They never said Indian brothers and sisters when many more bomb blasts happened across India and when thousands were kelled by paki-supported terrorists in kashmir. Just y'day we hear  the threats of attacks on India from  Sayeed on Paki TV's. If u feel pain for the kids then Show ur sympathy but dont go overboard like that stupeed Satyarthi who was asking taliban to take him. If he goes there , they will pout a bullet in his head and  throw in gutter like the terrorists did in mumbai attacks and kashmir.

                            Very very sad today. Can't begin to imagine the scenes in the school nor open the news to see dead children. Is this what years of evolution has led to? This raises a very important question which we should ask ourselves. What is worth believing in anymore, if not core human values. Now this event will lead to a counter attack on many areas killing more and then more revenge killings; never ending saga of death and destruction. The sane people in Pakistan have got to stand up and say,'enough is enough, and this will not be tolerated for another day'. Sack the entire intelligence service who create such monsters and put in a strong modern and sensible civil government, based on secular and pluralist values. Without this, this won't the last we hear of this.

                            It's a day like no other and will forever be remembered for it's barbarity which was unleashed on hapless children. Is there a difference between the children that died today and those that died on 26/11 in Mumbai or the countless in Kashmir? The answer to that question will answer the argument forwarded by Pakistani's while they approach the topic of terrorism. Good terrorist and bad terrorist had become bywords in their rationale for justifying acts of aggression abroad. But something has changed today. The war has reached their doorstep, and like the biblical plague, has taken away the little ones filling homes and hearths with a grief that perhaps can only heal by understanding that the scourge that they unleashed on their so called enemies has returned to them. The fact that it's in the nature of a scourge to annihilate and destroy, this monster fails to see the difference between its own and aliens. It's needless to say that it will spread and destroy more before the true believers in Pakistan wake up and fight back. We only pray that it's not too late by then and that humanity wouldn't have paid a heavy price in their country! Our hearts go out to the bereaved families!

                            tHE SAME FEELING WAS EXPECTED AT THE TIME OF ATTACK AT MUMBAI, AND SO MANY OTHER OCCASIONS.  LET US EXPRESS OUR SORROW AND EXPLAIN THAT THIS IS NOT IN THE NAME OF RELIGION BUT GAME OF POWER, MATERIALISM AND CONSUMERISM.  LET US TAKE DECISIONS IN THE LIGHT OF GANDHIAN TALISMAN AS GIVEN BY FATHER OF THE NATION IN 1948

                            I understand what you say. But one must remember the anger in the tribal people who have been attacked by the Army, and reportedly so many of their children and women have been killed. That anger caused them to retaliate, however, it has never been reported. This has been the big problem with "war on terrorism".. Inevitably, innocent people are killed by forces too, but it is always hidden in the name of attacking terrorists... Only solution is Gandhiji's way....

                            Ms Tarar, In this hour of crisis India and its people stand by Pakistan. But whether it is Peshawar or Bombay the pain inflicted by Terrorists is same and needs to be condemned by all. It is Pakistan and its intelligentsia who should make their stand clear- to condemn only Peshawar but not Mumbai attacks where more than 160 innocents lost their life. Lack of sympathy to the victims of Mumbai attack is evident from the refusal of your rules to hand over master minds behind this massacre.
