Headline::::How BJP Killed Its Chances in Delhi



DateTime::::2015-02-04T16:42:00+05:30



(Siddharth Varadarajan is a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Public Affairs and Critical Theory, Shiv Nadar University)
	As Arvind Kejriwal's campaign in Delhi surges ahead, it is hard to miss the desperation and panic that has taken hold of the Bharatiya Janata Party and its national leadership.
	The party's local leaders - many of whom resent the manner in which the high command imposed Kiran Bedi as their Chief Ministerial candidate - may have reconciled themselves to defeat, or at best a slender victory margin, but Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, who realize the stakes involved, are making every effort to stop the Aam Aadmi Party from winning. So far, however, their '3M strategy' of throwing Modi, Money and Mud into the fray has not had the desired effect.
	 
	Despite the crores spent on saturation advertising, the campaign rallies addressed by the PM and his 'hawala at midnight' allegation against AAP, Kejriwal's party is comfortably ahead in virtually all opinion polls.
	How did the BJP's script go so terribly wrong?  After all, it won the largest number of seats in Delhi December 2013 and all seven Lok Sabha seats last May. Given the prestige and popularity enjoyed by Modi, this election was meant to be a cakewalk. Especially since the AAP had the handicap of Kejriwal's ill-advised decision to resign from the Chief Minister's post after 49 days in office, which coloured the public's perception of the party and its ability to govern.
	If the BJP finds itself fighting with its back to the wall, it has only itself to blame.
	The first mistake Modi and Shah made was to delay the holding of assembly elections. Even though it was clear that a government could not be formed without engineering defections from the AAP and Congress, the BJP used its influence over the Lieutenant Governor to string out the process. What the BJP hoped to gain is not clear, but the delay clearly helped the AAP re-establish itself as a fighting force.
	 
	Fuelled by its victories in Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand, the BJP then made its second mistake: to avoid declaring a strong Chief Ministerial candidate and rely instead on the 'Modi wave' to see it through. Though this strategy did not work so well in Maharashtra, where the party failed to win a majority, or Jharkhand, where an expensive  alliance with the All-Jharkhand Students Union was needed, the Haryana result emboldened the BJP to play the Modi card to the hilt in Delhi. Where earlier the party had a strong and credible de facto CM candidate like Harsh Vardhan, voters this time around were encouraged to back a faceless campaign and trust in the magic of the 'Modi sarkar'.
	 
	When this strategy came a cropper - the very first rally addressed by Modi turned out to be a flop - the BJP brass changed tack and decided to project a credible local face to counter the appeal of Kejriwal. The selection of Kiran Bedi seemed at first to be a masterstroke. But as the former police officer hit the election trail, it became apparent that her attractiveness did not extend beyond the party's traditional middle class vote bank. Indeed, the goofiness of some of her pronouncements has alienated even middle class supporters, while her imperiousness has rubbed party cadres and local leaders the wrong way.
	 
	The BJP has tried to correct this third mistake by committing a fourth - getting Modi and senior party leaders to make personalized attacks on Kejriwal and to accuse the Aam Aadmi Party of money laundering and hawala. The allegations might have had credibility if the BJP did not itself take more than 60 per cent of its declared contributions in cash without providing any details about the donors. In the absence of any attempt by the Enforcement Directorate, the Income Tax authorities or the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence to probe the shell companies that are supposed to have donated Rs. 2 crore to the AAP last April, many in Delhi will likely treat the allegations as a desperate smear campaign.
	The Modi card may also now be facing diminishing returns, as voters tire of seeing the Prime Minister's face at every street corner and in every newspaper, and of hearing his voice on the radio.
	The election in Delhi is significant because it represents a pure political contest between the BJP and a rival that is strong and not discredited by corruption, or hobbled by anti-incumbency. If the BJP loses, the result will provide proof of concept for a model of politics that could also emerge elsewhere in India. Modi has so far remained unvanquished, winning every election battle he has led since 2002. Losing Indraprastha will destroy the aura of invincibility that has stood him so well for 12 years.
	Even if Modi manages to win Delhi for the BJP, the fact that he had to fight so hard ought to make him stop and think about what he is doing wrong. The campaign by the Sangh Parivar against a family-oriented film with a strong positive message like PK, or the communal statements of Sangh activists and leaders, is not something that attracts young voters with aspirations for a better life. Yet the Prime Minister has kept quiet, reinforcing the belief that he backs their divisive agenda. His failure to actually do things on the ground for the poor has also reinforced the perception that the BJP is a party of the rich and elite. If Modi does not fix these two problems quickly, his political ride is likely to be uphill from here on.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Dear Vardarajan,<br/>
Though i agree with you that BJP made mess in Delhi and AAP is a better option. But that does not mean that you people start saying that family oriented movies like PK is only hit by SAngh parivar. PK made angry in fact even other religious groups and even many family audience whose voice is unheard. its a different aspect that PK made money. CAlling PK a family movie where 50 year old Amir kisses and romances Anushka who is in 20s in the name of art sometimes looks awkward.

                            Kejirwal promises. Free water,Free electricity,Free wifi,Free ambulance,Free education upto 12, Free medicine for senior citizens,Free immunization.This election is fought on freebies and lies. If one make AK sit in front of few economist, he will definitely be exposed. Those living in slums will a not aware of these freebies r their own tax money. Even i can declared the above mentioned freebies, but that doesn't mean i can be made CM candidate. So the new change that AAP wanted to bring was that have a tight control on social media, blame others if AAP fails to deliver, and criticize media.

                            Your argument is sound and clear. An inclusive governance would never exclude poor from its agenda. A government which strives for the benefit of few millionaires, can never deliver things for the masses, who struggle for the bread and butter every day. Yes, you cannot keep imagining of creating world class cities in India unless and until you provide basis amenities in rural India. Politics of development cannot be successful, if it does not care much about the people who are below poverty line. If national parities avoid poor people, the parties will be ignored by the masses. Slogans like 'India Shining' will do more harm than good.

                            As usual Mr.Vardarajan's bias and hate towards Modi comes out at various points in the article. I wonder how such biased people can continue as journalists. <br/><br/>
As for reasons for BJP defeat, no one except people like Vardarajan care about PK protests or sangh's antics while choosing a government. People know to look at the big picture unlike our so called liberals and intellectuals.<br/><br/>
Yes, BJP does seem to be losing the Delhi election and it seems odd that a party that has so far played every election so well is so out of touch this time. I get the feeling BJP wants to lose these elections. In politics, you don't always fight to win elections. Sometimes there are more gains to be made by losing. Journalists have to find out what BJP stands to gain by losing this time instead of simplistic articles like sangh parivar &amp; people getting tired to Modi's face on posters!

                            Hard to disagree with any of that. BJP have been two steps behind AAP the entire election be it social media, declaring candidates, declaring the vision document and keeping their messaging disciplined. Whereas BJP has been all over the place, highly reactive than proactive letting AAP dictate the agenda. <br/><br/>
I am not a big fan of Kejriwal, but fair play to him and AAP for running a smart campaign. His economics though is scary, he is further left of the congress. If he wins I hope most of his talk is election rhetoric and he is much more sensible than that. I really have my doubts tough!

                            Very nice analysis. The best time for winning Delhi was in August-September; but our PM was busy then in other things. Now, he will know the consequences of taking Delhi for granted. Modi has been jumping to and fro between foreign trips and Ahmadabad in the last six months, relegating Delhi to a position never seen before. I remember he was in Gujarat when he received the Chinese Premier!. Last, but not the least, let us not forget Modi's 10 lakh suit which suddenly punctured his tall claims of selflessness. Even a hardcore BJP supporter like me felt a jolt that the man, I posed my trust in, suffers from severe identity crisis. Time to learn and mend ways, Dear PM.

                            BJP has made many tactical errors, genuine mistakes and also got some bad breaks.<br/><br/>
1. Everyone in Delhi knows Modi is already PM and doesnt need to get Delhi state. They still have high hopes of Modi for development.<br/><br/>
2. The lunatic fringe from all sections caused religious riots in Trilokpuri. There has been too much talk of ghar wapsi and love jihad and churches have been vandalised. Delhi's borders are burning under BJP watch - people dont like that, even Modi supporters<br/><br/>
3.BJP already has MCD and Police - let them perform in Delhi with these two - people of Delhi hate corruption in MCD.<br/><br/>
4. Kiran Bedi seems OK on paper and seemed like a masterstroke but doesnt connect with youngsters - she seems old and silly. She is a poor orator and a terrible politician, though as opportunistic as any politician in jumping at the offer of CM. People of Delhi hate Delhi police high handedness. Though Delhi police much better than NOIDA and Gurgaon - but this is for middle class. For poor people police does nothing - and Kiran is on the side of the police.<br/><br/>
5. BJP appeals to middle class but not middle class govt servants because BJP never gives anything to them unlike Congress - BJP has never given pay commission or generous allowances or DA etc etc - so they wont vote for BJP.<br/><br/>
6. All congress supporters - govt servants, juggi people, unauthorised colony, sweepers, autowala, muslim, christians, north east - dont want to vote for for BJP (though did so in central elections for development) - and since congress is dead - are switching to AAP.<br/><br/>
7. BJP obviously knows from where the money came into the accounts which gave 2 crores to AAP - but they are not disclosing - why? Is it from someone inconvenient - like a big corporate sponsor of BJP? Otherwise BJP would have tom tommed the name of the benefactor - so when Kejriwal also hides the donor - the mud doesnt stick. Everyone knows that Jaitley knows the bank transfer details - so why he is not telling? If he doesnt know, he is incompetent and how will they prevent terrorists?<br/><br/>
And so AAP is going to win the elections. And going with decisive mendates being given nowadays, AAP will sweep to majority.<br/><br/>
Because people think - who will oppose BJP? Congress is corrupt and sells itself. So does BSP and Samajwadi type socialists. Only Kejriwal will speak out fearlessly if BJP does something wrong.<br/><br/>
And who knows? Maybe they do something good for Delhi? At worst, AAP can be no better than BJP/Congress. <br/><br/>
But at best - we might get something.<br/><br/>
And in any case, whatever BJP wants to do for Delhi it can do through MCD and Center - so there is no loss.<br/><br/>
Possible gain + no loss = obvious choice AAP

                            Siddarth Varadarajan is a typical representative of the arm-chair critics who want to do "Modi bashing" in order to be seen and heard on the media. I would rather he wrote about the disaster that awaits Delhi if heaven forbid - Kejriwal wins.

                            if opinion polls are to be belived , the Arithmetic  is simple, all minority votes  this time are  going in favour of AAP sessing  that Congress is losing so as to  give AAP an edge . If at all BJP is losing this has nothing to do with MODI Wave or BJP performance as BJP vote bank more or less seems to be  intact. Evenif BJP manages to win credit goes to Krian Bedi. Perhaps BJP might have Gauged the exodus of congress votes in favour of AAP  and planned their strategy accordingly . As nothing could be perfectly predicted about Delhi voters mood as experienced in the previous election. what I speculate it is a BJP win if Congress maintains the same vote share like previous assembly election.

                            PM Modi needs at least ten years to rule India to pull it out of the quagmire that it has come to be known after the haphazard rule by the Indian National Congress. And in order to put it on the path to great future, he would need the constituent support from all states as well as territories such as Delhi. If the Delhiites, thinking themselves to be too smart for their own good should vote in the AAP party clowns and especially, the joker in chief Kejriwal, then they would deserve the 3rd rate city they call it home. Please wake and the coffee!

                            I agree with the comments. But still my gut feeling is that BJP will get the majority. I entirely agree with the two points listed in the last paragraph. As we all know too much of any good thing can become a poison, like that too much of Modi nauseates common man and it could be one factor against BJP in this election, especially too frequent over exposure of one person can do the damage. Delhi Assembly is toothless forum and I do not know whether it is worth giving so much importance

                            Sir, with due respect, your first line of the last paragraph is quite contradictory - honestly speaking, if Modi wins Delhi for BJP, is anything that you are saying here matter? It would be a victory of the strategy deployed by the party. You start by saying BJP has killed its chances and then end by saying "even if it wins". Not quite sure what you are saying here. Either you say BJP will loose or it will win. You are sitting on the fence here really and appear like you have not made up your mind or you just feel that BJP might actually pull if off. Thanks but no thanks.

                            It may be sensible for the astute PM to step back a bit from over exposure and lose the attraction and curiosity that discretion and rare public appearances evoke.<br/>
Discretion is the better part of valour and he must resist the temptation to visible and audible every where and every time.<br/><br/>
Public personalities need to foster an aura of mystique to remain in the public mind.<br/><br/>
His triumph has to make India and Indians triumph happen.Good Luck.

                            "What the BJP hoped to gain is not clear, but the delay clearly helped the AAP re-establish itself as a fighting force"<br/><br/>
They did not gain anything and instead became a target of suspicion! Perhaps they too were moved by the work AAP did for 49 days and could see that Delhi residents were visibly impressed. They feared that the positive impression of AAP was still fresh while his resignation was yet to affect his popularity. Hence, BJP decided to wait.. and wait.. and then, AAP bounces back and how!

BJP is a party which makes promises.<br/>
AAP is a party of youth, wanting to go to the streets to deliver value, do things for the people and make a change in India. We need more parties who would do something significant to that value.
