Headline::::Not Just OROP. Another Grave Injustice For Army.



DateTime::::2015-09-14T14:06:00+05:30




                                With all the understandable (and justified) focus on OROP, the media appears to have missed another major development in the Ministry of Defence - a decision to extend Short Service Commissions for 14 years. This is a gross injustice, and it is all the more difficult to understand in light of the Defence Minister's response to a question I raised in the Lok Sabha on December 12, 2014 (verbatim exchange follows):
"Madam Speaker, the issue of recruitment and the shortage of officers in our country is now widely known. But the Army appears to be addressing this by extending the duration of Short Service Commissions in a way that is doing an injustice to the officers concerned. In the old days, you would have a five-year commission. You would then leave and you would still be in the prime of your life; you would be able to find a job and move on. Today, they are making these officers stay for 10 years, 11 years, even 14 years. These are people who have no pension; they have no benefits. They leave the Army late and, as a result, they are not in a position thereafter to actually resume life in the civilian sector. I would like the Defence Minister to explain what the policy is now on Short Service Commissions. I would like to know whether the Government has begun extending these unobtrusively at the expense of the civil rights of the officers concerned. If they are going to do so, whether it would not be fairer to give them all the benefits that a normal officer would be entitled to, pensions included? Thank you, Madam, Speaker."
The Minister for Defence, Manohar Parrikar, replied as follows (again verbatim transcript from the parliamentary proceedings):
"Madam, I entirely agree with the hon. Member. Whatever was the original concept of the Short Service Commission is being totally put upside down by extending it to 14 years. In fact, I had a discussion on this issue. We are trying to address this issue very shortly. We will definitely take care of this concept. There was 17 per cent shortage of officers by the year 2012. As of now, we are recruiting more officers. Every year, we are addressing one per cent. So, we are coming down by one per cent every year. I expect that by another ten years, we should be able to ultimately fill up the vacant posts. As far as the Short Service Commission is concerned, I will definitely address this issue because I am also concerned with the same issue. I have asked for more details. There is some reasoning given by them. Give me some time. I think, in a couple of months, I should be able to address this issue. I understand your concern. The same concern was expressed by me. You are virtually suggesting to convert them into a regular Commission by taking it to 14 years. The original idea was different."
That's the point. The original idea behind the Short Service Commission was a good one: it kept the armed forces young, gave men and women in their 20s an opportunity to experience military life, while allowing them to have the satisfaction of serving our motherland in their youth and going on to pursue other careers thereafter. Those Short Service Commission officers who sought it could seek a Permanent Commission, but few got one and the vast majority were supposed to move on to other careers outside the Forces.
This is why the Short Service Commission was genuinely short - five years in your 20s added to your experience without making a major dent in your life or career plans. But there has been a gradual extension of the five year period to seven, ten, and now fourteen. As a former officer who brought the problem to my attention observed to me, "The SSC ceased to be short when it was made minimum 7 years. It became exploitative when made minimum 10 years. Now that the minimum service is 14 years, it is just abuse of the youth." As this former officer, Mr Balakrishna, argues, "Anything more than 7 years should be treated as a career option. And a career cannot end abruptly after 10 or 14 years."
The charge of exploitation or even abuse is not exaggerated. I recently received a heart-rending email from a Navy Lieutenant on a Short Service Commission, who shall remain nameless since he is still in service and I do not want him to be open to reprisals. I am quoting from it in his own language (without editing the English) to convey his genuine anguish: "The charter of duties are same [sic] for SSC officers as of PC officers. If duties are same then why there is a huge difference in benefits. We SSC officers will be out from the service at 10 or 14 yrs. At that stage we will be at critical stage we don't have any further exposure of outside world. We SSC are neither entitled for pension, ECHS and membership of any club. ...All benefits is [sic] only for permanent commission officer and the other ranks who does minimum 15 yrs of service and gets all facilities. If we are also relieved at the same age bracket then why this discrimination. Dear sir it is a sad state of affairs, all veterans are busy in asking OROP, but they left their brothers behind who had also spent their prime young time with them. ... Most of us has [sic] just started our families. Few are about to become fathers. Sir we are also human being and did nothing wrong while joining service enthusiastically but some where it is getting diminished...Our future is at stake."
It is time that, as a nation, we thought about the human beings who don uniforms to keep us safe. After 14 years of service, SSCOs would retire at the age of around 36-40 years, the time when job/financial security matters the most. By this age, most would have married and have school-going children; this is likely to be the case also for those released after 10 years. The chances of a Permanent Commission are minimal for most of the SSCOs; indeed the policy on granting Permanent Commission is very vague and decisions are left to the discretion - sometimes the whim - of the senior Officers concerned. Those in the executive branches of the navy and air force are not granted Permanent Commissions even if their performance has been better than their fellow officers who are permanently commissioned. It is a criminal waste of India's human resources that young officers, well-trained, qualified, medically fit, and willing to serve, are simply let go because they were hired under one category rather than another.
In fact many choose to extend their service to 14 years because of the uncertainty of a second career. And where can they go? There are no special provisions for them, and the existing rules don't help. Former SSCOs who are 36-40 years old will not be eligible to most of the Group A equivalent positions in the civil services or in public sector undertakings, as the age limit at entry is 30 years (a relaxation of five years is sometimes granted for Ex-Service personnel, but at 35 that prospect also disappears).
As young officers who joined the services in the first flush of idealistic enthusiasm wake up to these realities, disenchantment sets in. Our country cannot afford demoralization among SSCOs after a few years of service. Worse, the Government is beset with a large number of ongoing legal cases and representations against the evident discrimination in terms of grant of financial and other benefits on release.
            
The solution is simple. Keep Short Service Commissions short: in and out in five years, no further obligations on either side. But for those who wish to continue further in service - and whom the armed forces consider good enough to keep - they should be converted to a status that gives them the same benefits and entitlements as permanent commissioned officers of equivalent experience. This would make the SSCO both a platform to give motivated young people an opportunity to experience military life, and an alternative route to filling the ranks of military officers and curing the chronic shortages our armed forces are suffering from.
Those who quit after five years (typically in the age group of 27-30 years when the pressures of family are much lower and the appetite for risk is higher) will not find it difficult to embark on a second career; indeed the experience will stand them in good stead in landing a job. And these Officers can be ambassadors of Armed Forces in their second career and attract more youth to join the services.
            
As for those who stay on for 10 and even 14 years, the government should pay a pro-rata pension and related benefits, based on the length of service. The government should also consider making arrangements for lateral entry into the Civil Services, the Central Armed Police Forces, or public sector undertakings, relaxing the rules that prevent this from being an option.
If the Defence Minister really meant what he said in his impromptu answer to me in Parliament, he should review the decision of his bureaucrats to perpetrate an injustice upon the brave young women and men who protect our nation with their lives.(Dr Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

You obviously don't know that it is the Army which prepares these policies and gets them ratified from the RM. So if anyone is to be blamed, the Army is.<br/>
And mind you, all the present happenings are a result of total inaction from your misrule of 50+ years...and particularly the last10 years of UPA.

                            What faultless arguments. How can anyone disagree? Shashi is indeed a politician who takes up bi-partisan issues and needs to be admired for that. What is he doing in a party of "perennial sycophants" is hard to understand.<br/>
My own suggestion on the issue is that these Officers after their service in Army should be inducted into Paramilitary forces / State Armed Forces that will infuse professionalism in these forces.<br/>
Shashi, please keep up your fight for these officers. Our support for you will only increase if you manage to highlight the issue further.

                            The problem expressed by Mr. Tharoor seems to be genuine and should be addressed. There is no way an organisation employs someone for 14 years and then just let them to hang dry.<br/>
I am very hopeful that the current minister will address the issue as he is an honest and distinguished personality.

                            The problems of the armed forces are solved, unfortunately, by those who are not in the uniform. Thus the poor and myopic decision making for the armed forces. I believe that our armed forces are administratively better then the bureaucracy to solve it's problems. It is the job of the respected Minister to hear all but give credence to the right people.

                            Race to organize and obtain maximum maximum benefits!<br/>
Let your beggary be camouflaged as "izzat."<br/>
The poor farmer, landless laborer, small businessmen don't even know whats robbing them.<br/>
First 6th and now 7th pay commissions, unbridled corruption and rent seeking, bad behavior from the Civilian employees and now extraction - extortion in the name of "izzat" by the uniformed.<br/><br/>
Please ponder -<br/>
1. If at 17-18-19 years you become a jawan and then retire at say 32 after 12 to 13 years as a soldier. In return you get a reasonable, inflation indexed life long pension (sufficient to take care of your standard of living), life long free medical facilities (at hospitals which even the higher middle class can not afford), life long canteen facilities (concessional purchases of items from pin to cars), possibilities of various beneficial schemes, etc.. AND Izzat. <br/>
Who stops you from taking up another job at 32 even though you can comfortably live off your pension and funds?<br/>
The ARMY trains you for other careers at their expense for a year or so and also assists in the placement.<br/>
NOW LET US SEE HOW MANY JAWANS, JCOs JOIN THE PARAMILITARY -CRPF, ETC AFTER RETIREMENT TO WORK TILL 60.<br/>
2. The pensions of officers are Rs.45,000/- p.m. and above after only 18 to 20 years of service. PLUS a handsome pay out of approx. Rs.40,00,000/- from various funds PLUS all the facilities above at higher ratings.<br/><br/>
What is being shown here is abject greed and extraction of maximum benefits from the gravy train that the privileged in India have become. I respect the soldier. But we would be getting careerists with these things who will perhaps NOT MAKE A STAND at ARMS when the need arises.<br/><br/>
AND note that most educated youth in India don't even get a good job, leave aside the security.<br/>
Yes the Uniformed deserve respect. Yes we go about our daily activities due to their work (include Police also). BUT THEY ARE VERY WELL TAKEN CARE OF ALREADY.

                            Every SSCO knows the length of his tenure when he joins up. Every SSCO knows that there are no pension or other benefits for SSCOs. Then why do they join? Simply because they did not have other career options. To turn round now and criticise the system is specious. Emotional blackmail does not work for the defense services. The best option is to revert to 5 year SSC. Ex servicemen have quotas in various government jobs which help them after leaving service. It was wrong to extend the 5 year period for SSCOs and that should be rectified. That is all.

                            I believe that SSC must also be given same previliges as the permanent officers. During the moment of peril, the SSCO's are also included in backing up and support the functionary of defence forces. It is not limited to certain section of Defence officers.<br/><br/>
The defence of any country is comes under a very noble profession. Unfortunately, due to few dark dots, it has been under the fire of many internal scams by officers at all levels.<br/><br/>
However, one cannot dissuade them from recognizing their efforts at all levels. Let it be internal issues to provide support during scenarios such as floods, earthquakes, landslides all levels of Defence officers have been included to work on ensuring a safe and healthy environment for Indian Citizens.

But the matter begs an answer that what was the bleeding heart Shashi Tharoor doing during the last 14 years Congress rule. Are OROP and SSC some very recent developments? The BJP has been doing the same thing dilly dallying over these issues - saying one thing when it is in the Opposition and another thing when it is in the Government.

                            Not just OROP. Another Grave Injustice for Army SSCO by Shashi Tharoor, M P. Is a wonderful expression of thoughts which needs to be implemented by any Govt for the welfare of Non Pensionable SSCO whether already released or those who are going to be released in future. Minimum which Govt must provide is 1) Medical at par with those who are enjoying pension 2) Grant pension to those SSCO who were released after 10 years of service as allowed for civilian govt employees. Like Shashi Tharoor M P, if other Members of Parliament also show interest in the welfare Ex Servicmens &amp; raise their voice in parliament, the problem can be resolved much faster than we think. Hope media also pokes such questions to Indian polititions so that aggrieved SSCO can receive justice faster.

                            Well articulated. The government should definitely focus on this.

                            Thank you Mr Shashi. When I read your articles I feel  that i am dealing with a sensible ,intelligent gentle man. The problem of SSCO is really pathetic. Has a nation which is all set to exploit its own guardians any scope to be a great nation? I fear, with all my patriotic feeling  'no'. As you are in the politics you can gather support of maximum number of M.P.s from across the political parties. and take up leadership in democratically fighting for the noble cause of national security and human rights. I am looking forward such issues being brought forth by you.

                            If all the SSCOs - retired and serving - can come together, form a considerable vote bank and meet at Jantar Mandar, all their problems will be solved at one stroke. Without this, no arguments please. No reasoning. And NO politics. Status quo would be maintained....However, I would like to thank Dr Tharoor for bringing out in the open this anomaly and injustice. Hats off to him!

                            IF the parliament is allowed to function, Mr Tharoor, please do ask the Defence Minister<br/>
about this in light of the answer given by the DM earlier in the parliament. Let him<br/>
put forward his views and why SSC was extended as it is.

                            Okay, the current govt has committed the sin of implementing OROP in the form that Congress finds a betrayal. But, what were thugs of congress party doing for forty years. Oh! We know of course. They were busy swindling and filling their own coffers so much so that only 500 crores were left to show for OROP for the defence forces. Where have you and your party buried its conscience? Congress is a bunch of shameless sycophants crawling on the Indian soil today.

                            Mr.Tharoor should also can give suggestion to whomsoever concern that the SSC officers can be re-inducted in paramilitary forces and also he should raise his voice for PBORs welfare who are 90% of total defence forces, and scrap the colonial system flaws in the all forces.

                            Please understand that when an officer after 14 years of service approaches private enterprise for a new job, very often he will be offered pay lower than the normal since the HUman Resources departments know that these officers are vulnerable. Pity, how we treat those who serve the nation most loyally! Whit can't the Government create a testing scale for the short commission Officer's so that they can be automatically qualified for suitable openings in Central Services, PSUs and others such as Banks?

                            Short service commission (SSC) has become an exploitation of youth. Think of an organization, where your subordinates get pension, lifelong medical facility and housing assistance for 15 years of service. But you will out of service at an age of 33-37 without any of these benefits. SSC officer lands on streets without benefits from service and without relevant civil job experience. Government sees only what bureaucrats and defence HQ want them to see and since none of these two are getting affected, they are least bothered about the state of short service commission officers.

                            I am an ex Short Service Commission officer and my views are that a young SSC officer in the rank of Captain/ Major or equivalent stands released from the military in the age of 28-35 years which is relatively lower as compared to age of retiring military troops – an argument strongly advocated for favouring OROP for military troops. Most SSCOs may also be married and supporting a family at the time of the release. Their spouses also end up giving their thriving careers to settle as a dutiful domestic wife of an officer primarily because moving places every few years cannot sustain a full time long term career to bloom so, they are also placed at a severe disadvantage for making a fresh start in civil life pursuant to release of their SSCO husbands.  While the pay scales and pensions get revised periodically to the benefit of pensioners, the revision of terminal gratuity is never passed on to the deserving SSCOs for reasons best known to the Government.  Despite clear recommendations for lateral absorption of SSCOs in paramilitary services&amp; civilian defence establishments in the 6th pay commission , the rehabilitation / resettlement measures for such young SSCOs is limited to a mere 10 % in paramilitary Group A services which is anyways defunct in the absence of protection of any seniority of rank  On top of this  there are no Government guidelines / tax SOPs for absorption of SSCOs in Corporate Sector under the Companies Act, thereby leaving the SSCOs to fend for themselves post release based on their initial basic education and leadership experience acquired in military however with no pensionary benefits to sustain their families.  It may also be worth noting that if an Army soldier becomes an SSC Officer then he is entitled to pension after putting in a total of 12 years of uniformed service (including ranks), however graduates who face the UPSC exam for Short Service Commission and face similar selection process as permanent commission officers &amp; undergo similar training are NOT entitled to pensionary benefits even if their tenure is 12 years or more. <br/>
The SSCOs that acquire ESM status are further discriminated on various other benefits that apply to other ESMs.This is the irony of the system towards prevalent discrimination of SSCOs.<br/><br/>
SC has authoritatively ruled that pension is a right and the payment of it does not depend upon the discretion of the Government but is governed by rules and a Government servant coming within those rules is entitled to claim pension. So amend the rules please and cover all SSC Officers under pension benefits irrespective of 5/7/10 or 14 years as the Govt cannot have a class within a class.

                            I am sorry but I cannot join in this celebration and outpouring of adulation of the Indian Army. I am from N.E. India and the human rights violation an extra-judicial killings that go there are horrendous. I won't even into what is happening in Kashmir. Just visit the Amnesty International. Webpage. Where've they be politicians, army, policemen or IAS babus, they are a true reflection of us Indians and we have nobody to blame. As a democracy, we get the government we deserve. God help us Indians.

                            Important for everyone -----Obviously BJP is doing many things what Congress could not do .  What Congress had done is just freedom to indians from british. But BJP is doing what congress has already started and what congress had already done.  Renaming the t Swachchha Bharatask of Nirmal Bharat to, Aurongjeb Road to APJ Abdul Kalam Road and so so so so so on on on on.  Well done.

                            @Seshadri: Indian u have point. The logical action fro the SSCOs should be to absorb them in paramilitary and IPs. That will be not only justified but natural too.

                            Not sure If the headline really justifies the entire article. But valid point raised on short service commission. It should be addressed properly. As far as OROP is concerned, let us look at issue little more deeply then thought and addressed by Congress specifically, recently by Kapil Sibal. Congress accepted OROP in 2014 and set aside Rs.500 Cr in budget by last FM. BJP came to power and delivered the same, not to the satisfaction of agitating soldiers, but fiscally, whatever is the most prudent solution without compromising on basic principles. Also made a promise on facilitating the general increment frequency. what UPA-II did was out of compulsion it seems, but made an half-hearted effort. If going by logic of 500 crores was correct, what stopped Sonia Gandhi and then DM to announce it. It is clear that math done by either defence ministry or accepted by finance ministry was not correct. what is the comparison between 500 cr. and 10000cr. every year. Did Anthony missed couple of zeros. Also let us look from running the govt. point of view. NDA is doing far superior job then UPA-II. if the calculation done by defence ministry was not correct then Finance ministry should have aided them by giving them correct analysis, which this govt. did. not the last govt. Was last govt. ministries working on silos or they were working on tandem like this govt. IN a govt. your are supposed to work coherently for a common cause, which in this case was delivery of OROP,which this govt did but last UPA govt. did not. may I ask was last govt. working on tandem only for doing scams or aiding one another for concealing scams. or should I say Sonia running the govt. of scamsters. Should I ask the question if who was in-charge of UPA-II, Dr. Singh or Sonia Gandhi?

                            Pl do not make it UPA vs NDA. After the OROP handling we know the status of NDA as well.<br/><br/>
Dr Tharoor has raised a very valid issue and needs to be complemented and supported on the issue. For the same reason Mr Parikar also needs to be supported if he decides to act positively and resolve the issue.<br/><br/>
I was a Short Service offr once and know the merits of the case. I got permanent commission but scores of my course-mates were left to fend for themselves after giving their prime years. There is definite need for positive policies on the issue including arrangements for alternative career, proportionate pension, ECHS and most of all recognition of their contribution.
