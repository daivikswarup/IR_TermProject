Headline::::What You Should Know About National Herald Case



DateTime::::2015-12-15T19:06:00+05:30




                                A little clarity about the National Herald case might enable readers to better follow developments in the courts. So, here goes.
 
After winning the first-ever general elections of 1937, the Congress and in particular Jawaharlal Nehru felt the need  for a party organ to promote and propagate the party view on matters of national import. Accordingly, a body of 761 Congresspersons including luminaries like Sardar Patel subscribed to the shareholding of a company called Associated Journals Ltd (AJL) to start and run such a paper, the National Herald, and its Urdu counterpart, Qaumi Azad.
 
Both papers were quite a hit, so much so that when the Congress launched the Quit India movement in 1942, the British colonial authority felt it necessary to ban the publication of both the journals. It was not till 1945, and the commencement of the final negotiations that led to Independence and Partition, that the ban was lifted.
Publication was continued even after the country became Independent. AJL availed of its presence in a large number of cities to acquire real estate including Herald House on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg in New Delhi. When acquired, the properties were valued at relatively modest prices but, over time, real estate has boomed and the assets of AJL also increased exponentially.
 
But while assets increased, circulation dropped and finally plummeted to virtually nil in the early years of the millennium. Advertising dried up. It proved no longer viable to continue publication. During its period of decline, the Congress, whose mouthpiece it was, extended large loans to AJL, amounting eventually to some Rs. 90 crore.
 
Revival of the journals, or, in the alternative, launching different media outlets more in keeping with the digital age, led to the Congress deciding to set up a holding company, Young Indian. The holding company was registered under Section 25 of the Companies Act as a charitable enterprise legally obliged to keep all revenues (including rents from property) and profits entirely within the company. None of the directors had any right to any dividend income, perks or salaries. None of them could draw or divert any sum to personal or other purpose. None of them could access the assets of AJl and, in the event of any disposal of AJL properties, the entire proceeds would belong to the company, not a khota paisa going to the directors of Young Indian. Indeed, if they were ever to decide to sell off Young Indian, they could only do so to another Section 25 company, and the assets of Young Indian/AJL would continue to be with the new section 25 company, none of whose shareholders or directors could have any access to its assets or revenues.
 
The need for making this arrangement grew out of two requirements. First, with a debt of Rs. 90 crore on its books, there was no way AJL could access bank funding or the open market to raise the moneys required for revival. Some way had to be found of writing off the bad loans without the Congress losing control of AJL if the National Herald or its replacement were to continue playing the role for which AJL had been founded in 1938, namely, providing the media organs for the party.
 
The second was the frank recognition that the underlying reason for AJL floundering and dragging down both its media organs was that the Congress as a political party does not have the management experience or expertise to run a commercial enterprise, specifically a media enterprise. Professionalization was the need of the hour.
 
Both problems - wiping the debt off AJL's books and inducting professionals into the running of the business enterprise - could simultaneously be solved if AJL were to be taken over by a holding company that was like a trust. First, the holding company could convert AJL's debt into equity by getting the AJL's debts assigned to a new entity that would convert the debt into equity held by the directors of the new holding company. Second, professionalism could be ensured by professional business management and proven editorial expertise being co-opted to the board of the holding company, indeed, being made equity holders on par with other directors drawn from the party.
 
To this end, Young Indian was set up as a Section 25 company to which was assigned the Rs. 90 crore AJL debt and converted into equity held by the directors, seven of whom would be senior, trusted party functionaries and two of whom would be professionals, one a millionaire entrepreneur who had made his name, fame and money in a telecom company in the United States, and the other who had earned his reputation as a renowned journalist and editor.
 
These arrangements have been challenged by a member of the Central Committee of the BJP - hence the charge of "political vendetta" - on three principal grounds: cheating; breach of trust; and misappropriation. The claims will be examined in the courts and a verdict given. Meanwhile, certain key considerations deserve to be borne in mind.
 
First, "cheating": who has been cheated? Certainly not the complainant, whose very locus in the matter is in dispute. No one has come forward to say he or she has been cheated. No shareholder in AJl says he or she has been cheated. No stakeholder in the erstwhile National Herald/Qaumi Awaz says he or she has been cheated. No participant in the new Section 25 company, Young Indian, has said he or she has been cheated. No Congress party member says he or she has been cheated. If no one has been cheated, how can the complainant sustain his charge of "cheating"?
 
Second, "breach of trust": someone's trust has to be breached. No one says his or her trust has been beached. Indeed, no one's trust can be breached because all financial transactions of the section 25 company are "in-house" in the sense that not a rupee of the revenues, profits or other financial transactions of Young Indian can in law be siphoned off for any non-company use, and certainly not for any personal use.
 
Third, "misappropriation": except in the fevered imagination of the complainant - who is, I repeat, without locus in this matter and whose sole purpose is political vendetta on behalf of the party of which he is a member of the Central Committee - no one has complained of any misappropriation. Once again, it needs to be stressed that misappropriation with a view to personal gain is ruled out by the very nature of a section 25 company.
 
This is not an attempt to pre-empt judicial proceedings in the matter but with a view to educating a confused public, an attempt to place before readers the outlines of the defense so that readers might be better able to follow matters in the courts with informed understanding.(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            No congress spokesperson is saying what the company do with the profit. You are renting out 2000 cr(as per 2015 it can very well be 5000 cr) of assets and where does this rental income go. By rough estimation the rental income from 2000 cr assets will be around 40-50 cr per year. Where does this money go. Everyone knows how you can show expenses and take all the money. Above all Section 25 company is also exempted from taxes. So you are basically getting 40-50 cr per year of tax free money. That by itself is a scam.

                            All said and done, india is a democracy and the congress party should fight the case in the court and not waste the parliament's time. This is reflecting badly on them and their foolish heir Rahul Gandhi. If they keep going like this Modi's dream of congress mukt bharat is not far as they will be restricted to single digits in next general elections..Hope they change else they perish both good for the country!!

                            Another fantasy fiction from MSA. Whatever he says goes counter to what the court is saying on this matter. Court has found prima facie criminal intent and upholds Dr Swamy's locus to raise this complaint.<br/>
Shanti Bhushan has since come out as a shareholder who was kept in dark about these goings on.

                            Give all your explanations to the courts. The High Court understands law far better than you and your bosses, and they have seen merit in Swamy's complaint. You cannot convert a complaint of corruption into a case of political vendetta. it is funny that you think that setting up Young Indian was not fraudulent. The "seven senior party functionaries" should have been just that. Instead the shares were issued in their personal names, not as president, vice president etc. They have converted a party owned organisation into a private one owned by the Gandhis. With Rs. 5000 crores worth of real estate. To whom does this belong? To the congress party? Will the next president or vice president of the party control Young Indian if they are not Gandhis? Not on your life. In one aspect you are right. Nobody from the congress has filed a complaint of cheating, misappropriation or breach of trust. When the president and vice president are Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, who are the main beneficiaries, do you think they will file a complaint against themselves? It is common knowledge that the congress is virtually owned by the Gandhis. And people like Aiyer are faithful khansamas or retainers for whom the Gandhis are demi gods. So who is to question? Some maverick like Swamy, who else?  The fact that Parliament has been paralysed to ensure that the case gets disrupted only shows the hold the Gandhis have over the party. And yes, section 25 companies are meant to promote charity among other things. The question is, charity to and for whom? Crime does not pay, as you will soon find out. And GST will get passed. After the arrests and incarceration. Of whom? Take a guess.

                            Fairly logical argument. So why not fight it out in the courts if the grounds are solid? Why waste Parliament's time and make it into a bigger issue than what it actually is, going solely by Mani's article here? By obstructing Parliament on the grounds of National Herald case, Congress is giving the nation an impression that it is insecure about the judicial process as well as the outcome of the process undermining its Vendetta argument.

                            what abt the heirs of 761 shareholders who jointly invested alongwith Nehru. Cant 90 crores debt be settled by selling a small property of the company. Why should Young India takeover instead  they can liquidate the company settle the shareholders and take their share. Why should they create an holding company and take the assets of the company without settling the other shareholders. Just because they are a high profile family and who have been ruling India for decades does not mean they are the sole proprietory rights of AJL.

                            Now coming to Mani Shankar analysis, he should know that congress, as political party, cannot give loan to AJL/National herald (a newspaper, owned by board). Congress is not a financial company to give loans of its pubic money ---&gt; This is Legal violation ****<br/><br/>
Another analysis of Mani is Young India (section 25), as charitable company, formed by Sonia, Rahul and senior congress members, cannot buy AJL/National herald, which is not section 25 company.  As simple as that. ----&gt; Another legal violation ****<br/><br/>
Lastly Mani made it so unclear to understand. AJL sold the company to young India (section 25 company) for 90 crores. Young India took all the shares of AJL and gave the 95 crores to AJL.. AJL, with zero loss and zero gain gave back 90 crores to congress party . LOL!! Now shares owned by young India from AJL worth 2000 crores ... How? AJL company acted so dumb folded, it never knew its property's value. All the while it acted as company that is in loss.<br/><br/>
*****Now here is criminal intent---&gt;Congress to get AJL's property worth 2000 crores( which was sacrifice of many freedom fighters donation and participation), created young India. Any one who knows about section 25 company knew that if founders intend to apply its profits or other incomes only in promoting its objects should be able to. This means though company cause is to promote social activities , profits from that can be applied without any legal obligation. Why not ? After all company founders are working in it.

                            Dear Maniji<br/><br/>
You took lot of pain to explain the Deccan Herald case. <br/>
a)Is this your personal opinion or the Opinion of your party?<br/>
b) If it is your personal opinion, then I request you to simply tell me why do you need a news paper to run a political party? And why should you transfer shares only to two individuals- Rahul and Sonia who are majority shareholders.<br/><br/>
Leave all this, I respect you for being a vehemant congress men. My sincere submission to you is to raise people issues in your blog so that you can do some thing for us. <br/>
a) There is horrific scene in your homestate tamilnadu for wanting of relief work, you have never uttered a word till todate<br/>
b) The pollution in various parts of India and the traffic is killing people every day with cancer and other ailments.<br/>
c) Agri culture is dying. Your government voted dictatorially with no constitutional focus on bifurcation of Andhra pradesh today, every fertile land is being used for real-estate forget capital. Average Land prices market have shot up by 3000%.<br/>
d)Sanitation in most of India is an issue- Water is an issue. Urban planning is an issue.<br/><br/>
Instead you are doing a blog on Deccan herald that is nothing but a blind corruption of your boss. So maniji, request you to raise people issues and important issues.<br/>
Deccan herald issue has no relevance to Aam admi. Please connect to people. then they will read your blogs , atleast you will get better blog votes than real votes.

                            Both requirements that motivated the YIL are a complete fallacy:<br/>
1. " ... with a debt of Rs. 90 crore on its books, there was no way AJL could access bank funding or the open market to raise the moneys required for revival."<br/>
As Mr Aiyar has pointed out in the beginning, AJL owned high value assets. Is it not enough to secure a loan of Rs. 90 cr which is paltry compared to the value of its asset in Delhi?<br/>
2. "... the Congress as a political party does not have the management experience or expertise to run a commercial enterprise"<br/>
Well, why is it that all YIL board members were Congress members? If professionalism was the need, one would expect at least one or more members to be non-Congress members.<br/><br/>
Congress is on lose ground. This is probably the tip of the iceberg.

                            Factually wrong about inability to raise capital by AJL. Any bank will be happy to take part of the real estate and auction for loan. Company would still have enough. Real game was to wrest control of huge real estate which just seemed to be going down the drain.

                            Independent professionals to do what? No newspaper, no journal, no staff, no intention of releasing any of the above. Then what were the professionals doing? Not answered. Indian law says that you don't have to be cheated or have your trust breached to give a complaint. And court order clearly says it smacks of criminality, hence should undergo trial. No Gandhi took a penny, then what is the meaning of holding shares in a defunct organization. Why didn't the organization sell its land to other news publication to clear the debt? How can 90 crore debt be converted to 50 lac worth of shares of 2000 crore worth property. Have any of these questions been answered in this article by the brilliant stephenites!

                            Two important points, first Assuming that this opinion is fact, congress should allow peaceful court proceedings rather than interrupting the parliament functioning, Secondly there are far too many questions to be answered even if one believes this opinion, for instance who gives 90 crore loan to a non profit generating institution and not expecting any money in return?

                            60 years of lording over the country and all of its machinery, with a single minded focus on loot, from the lowest MLA to the PMs is how we know the congress. And the booty shows on the hides of kongressis far and wide, big and small. Their exploding personal wealths made a mockery of a languishing country, which was left behind by much less skilled, smaller countries year after year. Not that we didn't know it, by exposes from time to time. But congress had the total know how and perfected it year after year, of how to intertwine wealth acquisition with legalese, constitutional loopholes, international agreements where needed and not pursuing them where convenient. And then one day someone could tell the story to the whole nation and throw these people out. We began to recall the high point of the corrupt brigade' "accusing an MP of swindling 5 lakhs is.... So low, so unclassy" the magnitudes have a certain baseline, you see, said the indidignant! With the national Herald case, the nation waits with bated breath at the possibility of getting at least these guys to court, wants at least someone to decode the corruption quagmire perfected over more than half a century. The questions of grandsons of BHOPAL victims asking if the killer of a whole town was accorded a chartered plane escape, by no less a minister than Arjun Singh of Churhat Lottery fame, ... And the favor  had no pecuniary gains?  We're the dead not sold by the kongressis, and corporate favor didn't have a corporate quid pro quo.. It's payback time folks! Stop yapping on legalese Mani , you fooled us long enough, your beneficiaries are so widespread that there is very little hope for India. A magistrate here, a judge there, a policeman in your backyard, and if not, an arranged murder of a family member, to ensure not only acquittal by diversion in emotional drama, there is also,the possibility of  return to power! A hapless country ignorant of your expertise in corruption waits with bated breath, for deliverance. Wonder why the govt is giving apologies, and embarrassment of vendetta jibes, well the ousted were thrown out because of some wrong, if it's not brought out, it shames the people of this country.

What was effort or steps taken by YI to publish the news paper 4. There was GO passed by your own govt which enabled the section 25 company to convert to commercial company. 5. Expenses can be accounted to section 25 company for example Mr. Rahul Gandhi Bangkok trip can be made to pay by YI. 6. Lastly, this is not the case of common sense as Mr. Mani Shankar Ayer has explained, it is the case of violating law.

                            Thanks Mani for the clarification. No one is concluding anything on National Herald just because there is a court order. Similarly no one believes Govt ordered the Court to release the order as that is also not yet proved. But many of us conclude your party is irresponsible and doesnt know where to fight if they feel court order is not appropriate. And regular disruption of Parliament only shows the congress is different from Indian Parliament and they want the Govt to fail rather than doing any good for the country.

                            Sir, though I am no expert in financial or judicial matters like Mr. Swami, in my layman opinion, we all understand that AJL has assets worth millions and they are generating rental incomes as of now. So, why couldn't Congress just write off the loan and let AJL take a new path with the rental incomes of its own? Secondly, we understand that no Director or office bearers of YIL, a Section 25 company, are to benefit monetarily at all THROUGH YIL. But can assets not be used in other ways? Just to give an example, who would stop you to rent these high worth assets to people like Robert Vadra for a trifle sum and jack up their profits? <br/><br/>
Thirdly, your argument of nobody got cheated is like no murder happened because we made deceased's kins say so. This is funny to the core. Do you really believe Congressmen like you will ever go against the wishes of Gandhi family? We have lost all hope. This is not cricket where you won't dismiss the batsman because nobody appealed. There is a law in this country and somebody who brings any act of cheating, breach of trust, or misappropriation in front of law must be praised for the effort. <br/><br/>
We have almost no hope that Gandhis will ever go to Jail, but we pray law takes it rightful course and soon!

                            Dear Shri Iyer, your articles smack of nepotism and blind love for the family. Why is congress as a party giving loans to revive a news paper? Is Congress in the business of running business houses? Swami is an Indian citizen and has all the locus standii to expose these unclean transactions. Remember, Swami has never faced a defamation case. He has solid facts. Dont over react. Let the courts decide. I am not a Modi bhakt but request Congress help run the parliament and clear pending bills. I am not a Pappu bhakt too. I believe lets give Modi a chance for 5 years and then we can have all these discussions. I doubt at this rate whether you and your clan will survive the next election and even win a dozen seats. See what Modi is doing. He is working on CMB. Congress Muktha Bharat in short....very systematically. and all these cases are helping him achieve the goal.

                            What Mani missed (Deliberately) is that that 90Cr is Tax Free as CongI is a political party. But AJI is a private entity, and should not benefit from the Tax Free money. Also this is transferring an asset of the Cong Party to a Private Entity. Mr Mani, I know it is very difficult to explain, but other than the Tax free money Issues, it sure looks like someone is trying to cheat their own party. And the very fact that you are writing this article makes it "Chor ki dari me tinka" case. Let the courts decide, why disrupt parliament and write articles omitting key facts.

                            Anyone with basic knowledge of corporate affairs and accounting can easily identify the weak grounds on which the congress party is trying to convert a property deal into a innocent act. The reasons put forward by Mr Iyer are utopian and are common methods employed by any one who tries to amass illegitimate wealth. Needless to say, Mr Vadra would have made an ideal advisor in this deal. This is a classic case for all criminals who wants to learn!!

                            Most stupid arguments on the 'Locus'. Both in collusion and coercion, you will not find anyone with locus raising their voices. The law does give the authority for someone outside to ask this questions through the courts and that is what is happening. I am not a supporter of BJP but looks like Congress is losing this badly. You can not continue to assume that the people of India will stay fools forever. It is a pity that Congress thinks that it will be voted back just on the basis of sympathy towards the SG and RG's family. Sad... They can actually use this great opportunity to build the party and actually ask its people to work for the masses rather than just raising voice on a daily basis and losing people's faith. 5 decades back every Indian would have been proud of this party. Today hardly 7 to 8% are trusting them. What a loss of credibility....

                            Hmm .. a 90 cr loan is used in lieu of acquiring a company whose assets are in excess of 2000 cr and Mani wants us to believe that all is Kosher because both the acquirer and acquiree are Section 25 companies. Everyone knows that with the help of pliant officials who abound in our system, and all the voluble lawyers that the Congress has in great numbers, all these can be circumvented when they come into power, but that aside, why does your party have an issue with the exalted family  appearing in court ?? The court has found enough merit in the case to order them to personally appear before it and it is high time Mani and the Congress realized that even though they  worship the ground beneath  Sonia and Rahul's feet , there rest of the country doesnt share their piety. You guys held up the parliamentary session last time demanding the resignation of Sushma Swaraj and Vasundhara Raje ( against whom there was no case in court ) but today you want your first family to be exempt from the law of the land ? Mani .. face it, you and your ilk are fossils that the country would be much better without. Your definition of socialism is poverty for others and sweetheart deals for yourself.

Comment::::<div class="com_user_text">
                            Cheating, Breach of Trust &amp; Misappropriation:  The situation should be analysed properly.  <br/>
1. AJI is a company started by some shareholders (they happened to be some of the Congressmen is a different matter...there may have been others too since many people in Congress at that time left Congress), and hence is distinctly a separate legal entity different from Congress.  They are not the same.<br/>
2. AJI is indeed a "commercial" entity while "Congress" is a political party (in a sense, a charitable organization by wide definition).<br/>
3. The fund of Congress is of public nature (because it is made out of tax-free donations) and hence is held under "trust", by Congress treasurer or other authorities, exclusively to be used for political purposes.<br/>
4. As per law, no charitable organization (or political parties by nature) can give a "loan" to a commercial organization or to any other party for that matter, even if the "trustees" (or office bearers of a political party) collude to agree (and even members of the parties does not "question" the action).<br/>
5. Any member of the public has an inherent "interest" in these funds since they are made out of public donations, and has a "right" to question whenever they are being used for purposes for which they were not meant for when contributed. One need not be a member of the party or trust.<br/>
6. It is all the more sinister when a political party decides to "assign" this "loan" asset to a company ("Young Indian") with just Rs.5.00 lakhs capital, for a payment of just Rs.50.00 lakhs, effectively writing off the balance Rs.89.50 crores of public donation, favouring a commercial organization.<br/>
7. Congress did not actually make any effort to collect the money back from the assets of the commercial organization AJI, to which the loan was given.  The AJI had in fact assets worth at least 20 times of the loan amount, i.e. Asset base of at least Rs.2,000 crores (currently, the value is rumoured at Rs.5,000 crores plus) against a loan liability of Rs.90 crores.<br/>
7. The Young Indian is a "company" and not a charitable organization though it is under section 25 (i.e. the profit earned has to be used within the company only; the company cannot give away any profit to any shareholder or director as dividend.  It can definitely give "salary" and "expenses" to the employees).<br/>
8. Young Indian, by virtue of this assignment of the "loan" asset of Congress, becomes the creditor to AJI, replacing Congress.  Since AJI did not have money (liquid cash of Rs.90 crores, though selling an insignificant portion of the asset would have raised enough money in cash) to pay off the loan to Young Indian (not to Congress now), they arrive at an agreement between them to issue shares of AJI to Young Indian equivalent to Rs.90 crores at "face value" (with asset base, the intrinsic value should have been at least 50 times).<br/>
9. Since the existing shareholders base was very small consisting of mostly congressmen (may be many of whom could not even be traced), AJI issued 9 crore shares of Rs.10 each to Young Indian.<br/>
10. By virtue of this 9 crore shares, Young Indian becomes a majority shareholder (brute majority of 99%) of AJI and hence, virtually becomes the owner of the AJI worth Rs.5,000 crores of assets, with just an investment of Rs.50.00 lakhs.<br/>
So what are the issues?<br/>
1.	A political party loans its "donated" funds to a commercial organization.  This is "Breach of Trust" by Congress.  Party can donate the funds only to an organization having similar objectives, and obviously a commercial organization's motive is always profit, though it may do and does a lot of charity and commendable work.<br/>
2.	The loan given to AJI was for "reviving" the National Herald Newspaper to which Congress has a lot of sentimental value.  Instead, the money was used for other purposes and the paper was closed down, by letting out the premises to others commercially.  This is "Breach of Trust" by AJI, as the understanding was not honoured.<br/>
3.	Assigning the loan thus given to a third party for a paltry sum, writing off the balance amount, to help a third party to acquire the assets of its own debtor.  This is "Mis-appropriation" of funds, i.e. siphoning off the funds out of the system under some pretext.<br/>
4.	The AJI directors issue shares of 9.00 crores at face value, when the intrinsic value of the shares are much high.  This is "Cheating", the other shareholders, as their value of shares drastically go down without any real reason.<br/>
5.	The shareholders of AJI (some of them, not all), the office bearers of Congress (not all congressmen), and the shareholders of Young Indian (all of them) happen to be a set of same persons.   This is purely a related party transaction under the law, and amounts to "Cheating" the other stakeholders.<br/>
6.	The entire "understandings" become murky, when we know that the decision makers in AJI (director: Motilal Vohra), and Congress (Treasurer: Motilal Vora) and Young Indian (director: Motilal Vora), are all a single person.<br/>
7.	The shareholding pattern of Young Indian is 36% each by Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, and the balance 24% by Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes.  Thus the control of Rs.5000 crore worth assets rests in the hands of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi now.<br/>
So, what, Young Indian is a Section 25 company, where the profit cannot be taken out.<br/>
1.	Young Indian is only a shareholder of AJI, and AJI has tremendous real estate earning enormous rent income both now an in future.<br/>
2.	AJI being a commercial organization, there is no restriction on the utilization of the funds.  It can have "expenses" incurred and charged to the Profit &amp; Loss account.  Of-course, many individual travelling, staying, and any other expenses can become legitimate expenses of AJI, making the "distributable" profit negligible.  Who are those people, whose expenses can be paid by the company, I don't think there needs a guess.<br/>
3.	The same is possible in Young Indian also, if at all any dividend is given by AJI to Young Indian.  No need to give any dividend to the "personal" accounts of the owners of Young Indian.<br/>
4.	What the court has said now seems to be: "Legal care was taken (obviously with legal luminaries available to advise), but the "criminal" intent of Cheating, Breach of Trust and Misappropriation could not be erased.  Hence the summons by the Court.

                            When did Subramanian Swamy filed the public litigation case in Court ? Answer: It was on 1 November 2012. When did he join the BJP ? Answer: 11 August 2013. When did BJP Government come to power ? Answer: 16 May 2014..... So how can it be case of "political vendetta" ? And on what basis it can be said that it was challenged  by a member of the Central Committee of the BJP? Case was filed 2 years ago (before BJP came to power and 1 year before Subramanian Swamy joined the party). How come people of such intellect even write a column in a news paper ?

                            Mr. Mani..: what you do not point out is that there was no reason for the Congress to lend any debt Nor was there any need to transfer the debt to YI... If indeed the real estate assets of AJL was 2000 Crore odd, why not sell some of it and retire the debt. Further, what happened to the original share holders whose shareholding has been marginalised in the new structure where YI owns the majority shares.

                            As usual obfuscation of facts  by Mani Aiyer.But the vicious ferocity of attacking Modi is missing (may be he is  uncomfortable that he may unwittingly cause more skeletons to tumble out of his Italian Mistress 's cupboard ?). Mani Aiyer says "These arrangements have been challenged by a member of the Central Committee of the BJP - hence the charge of "political vendetta" -  really ? Since when Dr .Swamy became BJP member? What is the worth of the asset which have  come into existence due to contribution from many people including Sardar Patel? What is the expertise of Sonia or Rahul in journalism? Why they hold more than 75 % shares? Have  the people of India has no  stakes in  Congress ? Was Congress a  movement of the people or of a single family?   What right any Aiyer have, to prevent the people of India  from asking about the clandestine transfer of assets of their  party  to certain unscrupulous individuals by unethical methods through technical loopholes? How much more was swindled like this by these individuals? They have to to be sent  behind the bar sooner than later.

                            Mani,you are wrong. Shanthibhushan, one of the share holder have confirmed its cheating and gonna take legal route. Approppriation of assets to a company with major share holders as private persons may not be an issue for you as a sycophant, but we people and honourable court are not equally blind. Thats what court called criminal intend specifically.Here the question is why you purpousefully undervalued a company with 1000+ shareholders and obtained with a meager amount of 50 lakhs an assets worth 2000 crores.The court has noted that officebearers of the Congress were directors at AJL, and also the majority shareholders at YIL, while all decisions were taken without the involvement of the other shareholders of AJL. You say this money cant be taken, an objection there is as section 25 companies can use its revenue for all purpouse mentioned in its objective. The chanakyas who deviced out such a deal will surely find a way out for that money to individual pockets too.. And simple question was National herald revived after all this drama ? The answer is a big NO. Get well mani.

Political vendetta is part and parcel of politics. Unfair to assume that the Congress did not do it. <br/>
Considering that there is nothing that has been wronged, your set of prominent lawyers should be able to get this issue dismissed in a jiffy. <br/>
What makes us think that there is a proverbial daal me kalaa is the aggressive posturing of the Congress and holding the Parliament to ransom (which has now become a norm, rather than an exception) <br/><br/>

The question here is not about the innocence or guilt of the queen and the prince. That is for the court to decide. The real question is - why are they shouting in the parliment and not allowing the parliment to proceed. Parliment belongs to people and not just for the queen and the prince.

                            Many have raised a very good point that it if the argument is fair why not fight it out in the court well here is the response for that. How about police register a fake complaint against you, if you have done nothing wrong you should fight it out in the court of law right? But, how about the time and energy that will be consumed to fight the case? I has read the court judgement on its website, its many pages long but was worth it. Congress is right this time, there is no case. Almost all political parties take donation money and invest it some place else. BJP for instance invested in money market. Second most important fact, as noted by Mr. Swamy himself is that no transfer of asset has take place between AJL and YI so all the property we are talking about still lies in name of AJL. Of course some may argue that the control lies with YI and it can use it whichever way it wish and that does have merit. However, remember there is no criminal case unless a crime has been committed. The real crime, if you really want to grow above party lines, as raised my mr. Swamy is that congress party gave 90 crore loan to YI which was then brought by YI for 50 lakhs that has Gandhi's as majority share holders. Thereby defrauding congress donors who donated to the party. Now, let me ask you is that really a crime? There is no clear definition in our country how the money, once donated to political parties, should be utilized. In my view, the court has erred and was swayed by popular sentiments. It it was really serious about tackling the issue there should be a direction to bring political parties under more scrutiny as far as funds go.<br/><br/>
Talking about facts, BJP is pointing fingers at congress for stalling GST, but they have not yet come up with a clear response in the parliament or in media about congress' demand on GST. I do think there should be a cap on GST otherwise its useless to have it as states will add their taxes on top. This is the same provision congress had in GST and BJP stalled parliament. GST will reduce and simplify taxes for many including the Govt. but in no way a game changer as claimed by the Govt. The chief economic advisor himself confessed on this very channel few days ago that "in theory" prices should come down after GST. Now, i don't think it need any elaboration what he is saying. After reading Mani Shankar's articles here for sometime now i certainly believes that the man is well educated and well articulated. Let's not call him or anyone any names just because we don't agree with what he's saying. Our very own PM is also responsible for bringing down  level of decency in today's politics to where it is. If he or BJP really meant what they were saying do you think they will be cosy with congress and it's leaders as soon as the spotlight is off and no cameras are rolling? Divide and rule is not new, this is something British had done and now our political parties are doing. Like the wise man said, let's not like a man's idealogy/thought but leave the man aside.

                            Points of dispute : <br/>
(1) If injection of 90 Crore was needed why was a separate holding company formed<br/>
(2) Sec 25 company can still fund a lot many ventures without 'profiting' from it. As a matter of fact it can just project that goes into a pocket 'therefore never generate any profit<br/>
(3) If the company had 90 Crore rs loss and 5000 crore rupee asset value - who on earth in open market will not fund it. A Ssimple long term mortgage would have solved the problem ? we have an example of statesman that transformed itself from a newspaper to (now) a real estate company<br/>
(4) If congress didnt had the expertise to revive the company - why did Congress leaders trying to revive it (all directors of the holding comapany are cong leaders)<br/>
(5) Congress did'nt fund it - it gave a loan and then choose to write off. That's bad corporate governance, if you were listed SEBI would have directed a similar action. The allegation is simple - why did congress writeoff the loan - its a political party working on donations (someone else's money) entrusted on them with a specific purpose, It is a breach of trust to mis use it (like investing into a new company that in turn invests into a dying company but rich)<br/><br/>
This entire episode looks like a 20 something marrying an old and dying billionaire claiming to  do so to only help the old man live happily! come one this is land grab and we all know it!!!

                            PLEASE COUNTER THIS VERSION Mr. Iyer..<br/><br/>
National Heral was started in 1930 by Nehru and was publishing  News paper. During course of time, it accumulated land and wealth of 5000 crore. In 2000, it went into loss and had 90 crore debt. NH directors Sonia Gandhi, rahul and Motilal Vohra decided to sell it to Young India Ltd.<br/>
Now the funny part:<br/>
Young Indias directors - Sonia, Rahul &amp; Oscar fernandez. Deal was that YI will clear NH's 90 crore loan, and in tun will get its asset worth 5000 crore. TO strike the deal, Motilal spoke to Motilal as he was the director to both companies. <br/>
Now the twist :<br/>
To clear the debt, YI asks Congress party to give 90 cr loan. So Congress party calls a meeting decide to give the loan. Who meets? Sonia, Rahul, Oscar &amp; Motilal. Who approves it? Tresurer Motilal Vohra.<br/>
So Congress treasures Vohra gives 90 cr to YI Director VOhra, who gives it to NH director VOhra !!<br/>
Hold on, fund doesnt end here.<br/>
Next day, COngress party calls a meeting to write off the loan paid to YI. Who attends it ? Sonia, Rahul, Vohra &amp; oscar. SO the loan is written off !<br/>
Young INdia with 36 % share held by Sonia and Rahul rest by Oscar &amp; VOhra gets property of 5000 cr + 11 storied flat at Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg in New Delhi.<br/><br/>
WOW THATS CREATION... CREATING 5000 Cr out of thin AIR..
