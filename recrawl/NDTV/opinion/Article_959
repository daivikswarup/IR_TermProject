Headline::::Mr Jaitley, Eagerly Awaiting Your Reply



DateTime::::2015-12-20T14:28:00+05:30




                                On December 18, I held a press conference where I said that Arun Jaitley, the Finance Minister of the country, is "a master of half truths and beautiful lies". What I forgot to mention is that he is an eminent lawyer; unlike other lawyers, he loves to play with constitutional provisions like a musician. I must confess he is a genius in that. He has perfected that art into a "craft". This is a rare talent. He wrote a blog on the AAP expose of the DDCA scam, and instead of directly replying to questions that had been raised, he raised a few "fundamental questions" of his own to divert the issue which is diabolical in nature; since I have known him for more than two decades, I can tell you that he is hinting at the "irrelevance of free speech" which is a cardinal principle of any Democracy. Democracy without free speech is no democracy.
Read the first sentence of his blog and I quote - "Free speech is unquestionably a pre-eminent Fundamental Right, but does free speech include the right to speak only falsehood?" This sentence was not required at all in this debate about the DDCA scam. He should have answered specific questions but he took refuge in raising a larger question of free speech and tried to turn the tables on us. This is the same Jaitley who had questioned the "relevance of the Rajya Sabha", the Upper House, when the Modi government could not pass the GST bill; very recently, he called the Supreme Court judgement on the NJAC (National Judicial Appointments Commission) the "tyranny of the unelected". He has used the same expression - "tyranny of unelected" - for the Rajya Sabha too. On both occasions, his diatribe against the two constitutional institutions was misplaced and dangerous.
He was, in fact, advocating against the spirit of the constitution. The principle of "separation of powers" is enshrined in the constitution to stop majoritarian democracy from being converted into majoritarian dictatorship. What he has insinuated is simple. Since the BJP has a popular mandate and a huge majority in the Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister, Mr Modi, is "hugely" popular, and unelected bodies cannot or should not fetter the functioning of the government. Similarly, Mr Jaitley has also issued a veiled threat to CAG (the Comptroller and Auditor General). Enriched poitcally by the experience of the CAG's scathing details of several scams during UPA government, he has said that CAG should not sensationalise scam figures. If such figures were true during the UPA rule, then they should be true during the Modi regime too. But then Mr Jaitley is made of a different mettle.
In his beautiful style, he raises another question. He writes - "Federalism is not a one way stream. It is not always that the union Government challenges the spirit of federalism. A state or a union territory, by its unacceptable conduct can also be a threat to federalism". At the outset, one can agree with him, but there is a catch. Those who seek justice should come with clean hands. The record of the government in which he is a powerful minister is not above board. Since Mrs Indira Gandhi's time, this (the centre) is the government out to destabilize all opposition state governments.
Delhi is a classic example. The office of the city's police commissioner and Lieutenant Governor has been used in the most vulgar manner to immobilize the duly elected government. The Kejriwal government has not been allowed to choose its own secretaries, competent officers are being threatened, officers who are delivering are being removed without prior information to the state government, central government ministries have been told to not cooperate with the state government, the Anti-Corruption Bureau was forcibly taken over after having reported to the state government for the last 40 years. The Lieutenant Governor is declaring every order passed by the state cabinet null and void. MLAs are being targeted and put behind bars on trivial and concocted charges.
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar have also complained about the non-cooperation and blatant interference of the centre in state matters. Governors are behaving like central government agents. UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has raised this issues many times. The most recent example is that of Arunachal Pradesh, where the Governor's office tried to engineer a coup. His office encouraged the opposition and BJP leaders to initiate impeachment proceedings against the Speaker and destabilize the government. The High Court had to finally step in and stop the proceedings. Why did Mr. Jaitley choose to keep quiet on these matters? Are they not against the spirit of federalism? We are being told by senior CBI officials that they have instructions to "fix" all opposition governments and parties. Is this fair, Mr Jaitley?
Mr Jaitley should also remember that a constitutional sword is always hanging over state governments. The central government can use Article 356 on the pretext of a constitutional breakdown and sack a state government any time. Do I need to recount how many times state governments have been sacked in the past? State governments have no such power. So who is more dangerous for the spirit of federalism - the centre or a state?
It's an open secret that today, no minister in the central cabinet is free to take any decision. Respective secretaries are reporting directly to the Prime Minister's Office, instead of their ministers. Senior ministers are upset, but can't do anything except brood in private. Is this in consonance with the spirit of the federalism and democracy, Mr Jaitley?
Coming back to Mr. Jaitley's blog, in the latter part of his blog, he decided to talk about the DDCA scam, and I was hugely disappointed by his replies; I am left with no option than to repeat that Mr Jaitley is the master of half truths and beautiful lies. He has claimed that he has not been concerned with cricket administration since 2013. He is still the patron-in-chief of the DDCA. And most telling is the comment by cricket legend Bishan Singh Bedi to Rajdeep Sardesai: (translated) "not even a leaf can flutter without Mr. Jaitley's permission."
I would have been happier if Mr Jaitley had engaged with us and responded to AAP's accusations against him and the DDCA. When Arvind Kejriwal first raised the issue of the DDCA and Mr Jaitley's role in it, he responded by saying that "I can't reply to vague questions, if specifics are asked I would have replied". When I asked him five questions which were widely reported in the media, he decided to duck. I don't want to repeat those questions now. I just want to say to the public at large what was said long ago - "There was an old man of Boulogne who sang a most topical song. It was not the words that frightened the birds but the horrible double - entendre". Mr Jaitley knows exactly what I am saying, and so do those who know him well.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Ndtv is putting its reputation at stake by allowing jokers like Ashutosh to write on its portal. There is absolutely no substance in whatever he is writing. When was the last time article 356 was used and by whom?? When the centre was going hammer and tongs against democratically elected ( that too multiple times) Gujrat govt where was Ashutosh. Let him reproduce the pieces he had written back then saying federalism is in danger.... Otherwise just shut up. The right to free speech is in grave danger because of people like Ashutosh who speak only in falsehoods and stupidities

                            Secretary in Delhi Chief Minister's office is found to be corrupt and in possession of lakhs of unaccounted money and Ashutosh wants a reply from the FM of India. What kind of jokers have been elected to the Delhi ? And as usual, accusations from AAP and no proofs. While CBI has caught Arvind's favorite secretary with all proofs. Dear Ashutosh, it's time to grow out of diapers. And do you remember Sheila Dikshit ? Arvind was reading her file. It has been 3 years since he began reading his file. Can you please give an answer to this ?

It will be next to impossible for you to admit this truth but everyone knows. In your party YY, PB were good. Bhagwant Mann is still good, Manish Sisodia is also not that bad, but you have no face and no value either. Your only need is that kejriwal needs one corrupt media person to spread the lies, anxiety in the society. So you waste of a skin solving his purpose  to point fingers at other. But justice will be done.  I pray to god that you the hater will soon pay the price of your dark deeds.

With utmost and sincere respect, I just want to ask you a question through NDTV. Why everyday a new drama ? Press conference and allegations. Why don't you go to court and put your all findings before the court to have a look and decide. At media and conferences we the common people listen ur allegations and from govt a counter allegations. Whole country s fed up with this. At least if I don't say about country, but still people like me have fed up with this Tom and Jerry kind of fight. Please put all these to stop and go to court. Common people who listen these comments doesn't have the power to make judgement. Only we can make the judgement about a person. If u want us to make personal judgement then fine, but if u really want to put facts and observations then plz go to court. We still have a great faith over our judiciary. Once for a time we can't believe u politicians but our faith over our August courts are still intact.

                            Most ridiculous thing in Indian politics. No body ready to take responsibility for their own deeds and just pointing other weaknesses. The present issue is CBI raids on secretary of Kejriwal and why he appointed him when his previous record was much tainted. <br/>
Kejriwal seems to be in habit of appointing corrupt people at important places. I dont want to connect this issue with Arun Jaitley as they started raising it only after the CBI raids.

                            Ashutosh, Please stop your rhetoric and spend a day in the streets of Delhi as AAP leaders did 2 year back to convince the citizens, and you will know where is your approval ratings. Coming back to your questions , honestly speaking any sensible person can make out that you are Trying to engage FM in a discussion and indirectly get some noise going for masses and confuse people more.

Your Kesriwal rather had to apologize to gadkari in court making him eat his own spit <br/><br/>
What about your fake degree law minister and numerous other FAKE MLAs of your party like Bharati,<br/>
While you willspend crores of rupees for advertisements for branding kesriwal.you will not pay safai karamcharis pushing delhites to dengue epidemic causing many<br/>

                            The AAP leader should have revealed and come clean about their fraudulent money transaction of Rs. 2 crores received by the AAP on a given night in the form of 4 cheques of Rs. 50 lacs each  from some mystery donor companies with fake office addresses in Delhi slums.  No one really believed that the AAP leaders did not know who the donor was! Simply by listing the cheques on their website could not absolve the AAP leaders from the responsibility of duly verifying and revealing the source of this fraudulent transaction keeping in view that the very existence of the AAP as a political entity was based on fighting corruption.

                            I don't think this is an issue that should take so much focus from AAP. People facing winters without food and shelter is a larger issue. Please focus on the real stuff. Lots of times I get the feeling that your party has decided that they want 10 mins of each news bulletin and while that is perfectly legitimate goal of the party, it cannot be at the cost of governance. Please govern. Please focus and please save your energies for stuff that really matters to people

                            Hey Ashutosh,<br/>
I thought that your are man of commonsense, but my perception was wrong. Its easy to ask question but are you entitled to get answers. I am not defending Jetley but if you have something serious to claim then go to court, follow the procedures and make sure that nations knows the complete truth based on proven fact and explainable by Constitution of India and understood by Judiciary so that culprit should go behind bars.<br/><br/>
It's so easy, fashionable and political to raise finger against your political opponent, just by fancy thoughts. So talk something sensible and generate some faith of nation by your actions.

                            Dear Mr Ashutosh<br/>
I have the highest regards for you as an individual and appreciate your work as a Journalist.I am not any party supporter but an individual who has his own perceptions and thought process on various issues.Before i give my views, let me make one thing clear that i am not a Pro BJP or anti AAP.Whatever i write is my own personal opinion.I was a great fan of Arvind your CM of Delhi.Probably, i know him more than what you know of him as i was his Alma Matter during his IIT Days.His honest and simplistic approach during his engg days and during Anna Movement was exemplary and noteworthy.His tenure with IRS was too gud as i watched him from my Corporate office at Gurgaon.<br/>
However, what turned me off was when he decided to turn into a politician inspite of the fact that he issued statements in press that he will never ever enter politics.I will not go into his compulsions of going into politics but the fact remains that he realised that he can be a force to recon with in Indian Politics.I still regard him as one of those rare politician who his honest up right and willing to walk that extra mile to serve people.<br/>
However in the last few months, i have been seeing him and of course you getting into politics of criticising opponents and making issue out of it for personal gains.I am sure u will agree that u are into politics for serving your own purpose rather than serving the people.<br/>
Delhi Police and ACB not in your control has been there since ages and you must learn to live with it.Do you think that past govts have not performed with these constraints.Everybody has certain limitations and your party has also inherited the same.But that does not give you the right to tell people that u are not able to perform as u have certain system limitations.PEOPLE WHO PERFORM UNDER ADVERSARIES ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE APPRECIATED.<br/>
You are a honest trier.Please dont get swayed by people like Raghav Chaddha and Sanjay Singh or Kumar Vishwas.They are people who are running the show today and forcing Arvind to say what they require.Look at another great friend of yours namely Ashish Khitan.He is happy getting all the facilities of a minister and has become a rable rouser of AAP in media.<br/>
Please show some restraints but you are also eying Rajya Sabha seat in the next couple of years.<br/>
AAP is still clean of corruption but the way they are functioning is not acceptable.<br/>
Would appreciate a reply from you <br/>
Regards<br/>
Ashish Mehrotra

What a bunch of jokers these people have become. The only serious competition to Kejriwal for the crown of "Clown of the Year 2015" is Rahul Gandhi. May the best clown win !

You have been a journalist so kindly let me ask you this --- Mr. Kejriwal &amp; you all had waived a lot of reports, information against Mrs. Sheila Dixit as well. But you have been in power for over a year &amp; not a single investigation has been ordered against her. <br/><br/>
Infact you have no moral authority to ask any questions when you have not answered any questions about your ministers, MLA's etc who have been arrested or charged with wrongdoings.

No matter what excuse you give, if you do not produce  significant results, you will be history. So, stop fighting, cope rate  with  the ruling government and the police and produce results. Indians must dispute and argue, so you cannot be anything different, God Save Delhi.

                            Dear Political Stand-up Comedian Ashutosh,  Arun Jaitley has replied to you in the only language you people understand.  Remember the defamation case outcome of Nitin Gadkari.  Those who don't learn from the past are condemned to repeat it.  You and your ilk will now be only at the mercy of Law.

                            Yeah, you will get your answer in court. Get ready to answer the defamation case. As it is sub judice, nothing more can be said by Jaitley.

                            Your logic of proven guilty if AK says so is just wrong. Go and prove in court now you liars.
