Headline::::With Vyapam, Another Modi Rival Lands in Crisis



DateTime::::2015-07-09T20:39:00+05:30




                                For the last three days I have been attempting to write this column on the Vyapam scam post my conversations with many players and stake-holders from Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. At the risk of giving it a Kafka-esque colour, I must confess it has been an impossibly mystifying case where every day throws up a bizarre, new and often criminal twist in the scam.
Enough has been said, written and investigated about Vyapam in the last few days since the Indian media woke up to the sudden death of 38-year-old journalist Akshay Singh while covering the story for the India Today group. Many, including this journalist, have expressed apprehensions over the deaths that have taken place over the last few years in the case. Can the various deaths in the Vyapam case - which includes witnesses, accused and now a journalist - be a mere coincidence?  
It could well be that there is a conspiracy to silence those who could expose crucial information, but it would be presumptuous and unjustified on the part of both the opposition and commentators to link every possible casualty with the Vyapam scam.
To begin with, it is most amusing to see the Congress party outrage over a scam which saw its genesis in the late 90s. Cases of irregularities in entrance tests conducted by the Vyavsayik Pariksha Mandal, responsible for recruitment in government jobs and admissions in educational institutes, started as late as 1996.
The first FIR was filed in the case in 2000 when Digvijaya Singh led the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh. The Congress was in power in the state till 2003, so it would be factually incorrect of the party to wash its hands off the case. Is the Congress complicit? If local ministers and investigating officials are to be believed, in a scam which involved cops, bureaucrats, politicians and middlemen, members of both major political parties played a role.
Now for the BJP, which is in power both at the Centre and at the state, and faces a similar predicament as was experienced by the Congress during the Adarsh scam in Maharashtra which forced the resignation of Chief Minister Ashok Chavan and named many senior BJP and Congress leaders as beneficiaries. But the Madhya Pradesh scam assumes great sinister proportions because of the spate of deaths, and this is why the Congress' demand for the resignation of Chouhan as Chief Minister gains credence. Keep in mind that whistleblowers and some witnesses fault Chouhan and his administration for failing adequately protect them.
To try and grasp the deep complexity of the Vyapam case, it is essential to understand the internal politics of the BJP and the RSS in Madhya Pradesh. Shivraj Singh Chouhan, an LK Advani loyalist, told this journalist in 2013 that Narendra Modi was not the only contender for the post of Prime Minister, and that the BJP was home to many capable Chief Ministers. The message was clear - Chouhan, as a Chief Minister with a reputation for probity, was in the race too for Prime Ministerial candidate. Such was the rift between Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Modi that when the former was in Gujarat to campaign for the last Assembly election in 2012, it is alleged that very few turned up at the rally as a part of Modi's strategy.
Veteran LK Advani, who has been unabashedly sidelined within the party, had to ensure that Modi's point person in the RSS, Suresh Soni (who is from Madhya Pradesh), did not replace Shivraj Singh Chouhan with Prabhat Jha as the Chief Minister when the BJP won the last state election in November 2013. Prabhat Jha, party in-charge of Madhya Pradesh, had rebelled against Chouhan during that election.
Sources say that another reason for Suresh Soni to push for Chouhan to be replaced with Prabhat Jha was his alleged involvement in the Vyapam scam. Suresh Soni's name figured in the Special Task Force (STF) report in the Vyapam case - he was named by at least two accused according to the report dated December 2013. Newspapers in Bhopal did front page stories on the alleged involvement of the RSS leaders.
Suresh Soni was the second-in-command to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat till last year, when, reportedly because of the taint of the Vyapam case, the RSS top brass replaced Soni with Krishna Gopal as its new pointsman for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
In mid-2013 came reports in the media that suggested documents found in a raid by investigators linked Suresh Soni to the scam. 
According to media reports early in 2014, when Lakshmikant Sharma, the former Minister for Higher Education was arrested in connection with Vyapam, he named Suresh Soni as one of the beneficiaries. Newspapers said that a month earlier, in the December 2013 report filed by the STF, Soni had been named by four accused for personally sending in recommendations for candidates to universities in Madhya Pradesh.
This information had not been used by the STF in court. It had clearly been leaked to the media. Sources suggest that state ministers complained to the RSS headquarters that Shivraj Singh Chouhan was responsible, and that he was summoned for an explanation by the RSS. At the end of 2013, STF stated to media persons that there was no mention of RSS names in the report it had presented in court. 
In the last two months, new leaks to the media targeted officers seen as close to Shivraj Singh Chouhan. It is alleged by reliable sources that Advani's controversial statement last month that an Emergency even today cannot be ruled out because "the forces that can crush democracy are stronger" - read as an attack on Modi - was reportedly the result of an intervention sought by two of his proteges - Sushma Swaraj and Shivraj Singh Chauhan - who were confronting the scandals of Lalitgate and Vyapam.
Another Union Minister, Uma Bharti, who has made remarks undermining Chouhan's assertions of an impartial Vyapam investigation is reportedly upset that her name has been retained in the STF's report whereas those of RSS functionaries have been deleted.
Shivraj Singh Chouhan, unlike his contemporary from Rajasthan, Vasundhara Raje, does not enjoy great support amongst his MLAs. Home Minister Babulal Gaur - an old rival - has placed all blame at the Chief Minister's doorstep. 
Irrespective of the consequences, the Vyapam episode has weakened the position of yet another Modi rival. But politics apart, the case as it stands today has become a grave threat for whistleblowers and witnesses. And for the right reasons, the buck should stop with Shivraj Singh Chouhan.(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer.

                            Very confusing article.Author blames everyone and finally signals, because of being Modi Rival, the CM is singled out. And kind of indicates that, the CM is being trapped by Modi only. Madam, this kind of logic of blaming Modi for everything and anything does not work.

                            Seems unlikly. Modi being the PM has lot more to lose with such trivial rivalry.  This writer while subtly implying that Modi is the driving force behind these leaks, allegations and scandals forgets that the PM is much smarter ( by any means of yardstick) considering that he rose to power from almost oblivion to indulge in such gimmicks..

                            Media is powerful. Media pressure can Smash up anything. That is the reason why all TV channels in India are doing Mind-boggling business of several thousand of crores. This is same all over the world. Before the war on Iraq, the TV channels successfully brainwashed the educated Americans with WMD story. The NWO banks collapsed the Greek economy.  the media in Greece  is misguiding the people and politicians into signing several bail out packages The ISRO spy ring case that rocked Kerala in 1994 was entirely a media creation

                            Thank god! At least someone is on track in this case. Blaming solely BJP is learning half background of the scam and forgetting the rest. Why didn't Mr. Digvijay Singh spoke when the scam was initiated under Congress' government. Sneaking out from the conspiracy and putting the onus on BJP for the mishaps is naive.

                            One observation which applies not only to this article but to all the coverage by the press and TV about this scam in the last 4 to 5 days.  While the deaths have been taking place over the past 2 years, i had never seen any coverage in national TV channels or press.  But what exactly triggered the entire press and TV to cover the subject so vigorously now is the death of one journalist - who happened to be one of their fraternity.  The deaths of 35 to 40 persons did not make any impression on the TV and press for covering this scam as much as the death of one journalist made all these people sit up and start shouting. I wonder if the journalist had not died, whether this Vyapam scam and all the deaths would have got the required attention and seriousness?  It is for the TV / Press and Journalists to seriously introspect.

                            Why do left liberals dislike our pm so much? In the vyapam scam court monitored probe is going fine and it has been referred to CBI. Contrast this with UPA behavior, where nothing was done until the court forced them. Rana Ayub should more objective in her writing.

                            Those who want to understand mysterious methods of Modi should study how Hitler used to illimitable his possible rivals within his own evil organisation in Germany.---- They will find there are plenty of similarities between the Nazis and the puppet of RSS called BJP.---- So hardly surprising that every possible challenger to Modi's position gets exposed for involvement in some serious scam, hence it is reasonable to ask if the Modi camp within fascist BJP is involved in secretly informing the media and why Modi himself remains silent on the subject.-- BJP is a nasty organisation and it's wing led by Modi is even more dangerous.

                            Very nice analysis - well done, and keep up the investigative and questioning attitude.<br/><br/>
It is indeed very suspicious that Modi detractors are the ones getting into these scandals. The Congress keeps gleefully pouncing on these scraps thrown at them every now and then, but everyone of them seems to have the potential of putting Modi in a more powerful position, either externally or internally. <br/><br/>
There is another plausible theory - Congress finding and using these issues to embarrass Modi and force him into action. Perhaps they are confident that the BJP would explode if Modi acts. You cannot put anything past the conniving Diggy.<br/><br/>
Irrespective this has happened in the CMs watch, and a lot rests on how the BJP cleans up this mess. If they give a free hand to the CBI and really find those guilty of directly instigating the murders, they would have used this episode to their advantage and could pour water over any remaining embers of the Congress. <br/><br/>
If the BJP fails to do that, they run the risk of an uncontrollable Congress fire, and Modi would only have internal politics to blame.<br/><br/>
I encourage the author and other media people to bring all the big names involved into the public realm. Use blogs if there is a backlAsh from the establishment. You guys are crucial to bringing India out from the corrupt mess it is in. I hope you guys find the courage and conscience to do that!

                            Vyapam scandal has led to heinous crimes it seems. Hence journalists must retain focus on investigation into crimes (corruption and alleged murders). Any conspiracy theories like this article alludes to will only divert attention and inadvertently help beneficiaries be they political or others.

See, the entire middle class is in this corruption since time immemorial - if your father has given a donation for your school admission and the principal/ school admin who took it. that is not the point. the points are:<br/>
a. whether the involvement of state political administration there and prima facie has evidence of their involvement<br/>
and <br/>
b. whether people get murderded when their is attempt to unearth the scam<br/>
and<br/>
c. to what extent the corruption occupies the seat: 10%? 20%? 50%? in MP, it appears to be 100%.

                            Congress has many members in their top leadership. Even if they have to fire a few more they still have more to replace them. BJP on the other hand can't afford to lose any minister (Raje, Swaraj, etc. ) because they have no one else to replace them. Which is why you and I are seeing so much resistance from the BJP.

Now if Digvijay thinks that by doing this and delaying the enquiry by asking for CBI probe which is already done he will wash his hands off or will get an escape and resume his CM ship then he is highly mistaken. Not even a single person in MP support him. This is the reason he is turning towards national media.
