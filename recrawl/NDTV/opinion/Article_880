Headline::::The Hypocrisy of the BJP and Cow Slaughter



DateTime::::2015-10-19T14:31:00+05:30




                                Ignorance can be condoned and remedied. Bigotry and prejudice as has been displayed by the Haryana Chief Minister in his open threats to the Muslim community under the guise of protection of the cow should come under provisions of hate speech and be dealt with by the law.
Such statements by leaders have a direct impact on the actions of their supporters. The hate campaign in the name of prevention of cow slaughter has taken its toll of another young Muslim life in Himachal Pradesh. This follows the attacks on cattle traders in Mainpuri. In response to a question after the lynching in Dadri, the Prime Minister had replied, "What has the Central Government to do with it? It is for the State Government to respond."
This is like an arsonist blaming the fire services for not coming in time to douse the fire he has lit.
When Cabinet Ministers or Members of Parliament belonging to the ruling party make inflammatory statements which have direct consequences in inciting violence against the Muslim community, the Centre has everything to do with it. Removing them from their posts would, for example, have an immediate and salutary impact in preventing others from making such statements, but this is not the preferred path because of the larger more fundamental agenda of the Hindutva forces of polarizing  India on religious lines, with which the Prime Minister clearly agrees.
This is not to say that State Governments have no responsibility. Certainly, the Uttar Pradesh government is answerable for its failure in preventing the spread of communal feelings by the RSS and its cohorts. It is equally responsible for the provocative statements made by serial offenders like minister Azam Khan against whom action should be taken.
The snowballing impact of the Hindutva offensive on the issue of cow slaughter was felt last week when the Himachal Pradesh High Court in a questionable judgement asked the Central Government to "consider to enact the law prohibiting slaughtering of cow/calf, import or export of cow/calf, selling of beef or beef products, in its own wisdom at the national level, within a period of three months"...It also gave a directive to the Central Government "to provide funds for the upkeep of stray cattle."
Not surprisingly, this has immediately been picked up by the Vishwa Hindu Praishad to demand such a national law. There is a deliberate attempt to whip up a feeling  that cow slaughter is rampant because of weak laws.
The 2012 cattle census shows that there has been an increase in the number of cows in India by 6.2 per cent compared to the previous census in 2007 whereas the numbers of sheep, goats and pigs declined. This hardly points to rampant slaughter of cows. Secondly, most states in India, with the exception of the North Eastern states already have laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows and their progeny. However, most of these states allow the slaughter of draught animals including bulls and bullocks if the cattle are found to be "unfit for work or for breeding" and certified to be fit for slaughter.
According to the website of the Animal Husbandry Department of the Government of India, such states which permit slaughter of "useless cattle" include Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal. The procedures and standards for slaughter may differ - such as the age of the animal which can vary from 10 years in Kerala to 15 years in Madhya Pradesh. In some states such as Bengal and Tamil Nadu and Kerala, dry cows can also be slaughtered.
This is quite in tune with Article 48 of the Directive Principles of the Constitution, which gave special protection to the cow not for religious reasons but on grounds of "scientific agriculture" and for "taking steps for preserving and improving the breed and for prohibiting the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle." Of course this Article itself was a compromise worked out with the proponents of a national ban on cow slaughter by Dr Ambedkar in the Constituent Assembly, who was opposed to such a ban.
But with the advent of the Modi regime, the Hindutva right wing wants to reverse the compromise, change the legal provisions and extend it to a total ban removing the "fit for slaughter" provisions and also to link it with a ban on the consumption of beef. This has been done by the BJP Government in Maharashtra as well as Haryana this year and earlier by Gujarat in 2005.
However, the purpose is less for the protection of the cow than for targeting the Muslim community.  This agenda also requires the rewriting of history and the creation of a narrative that cow slaughter was introduced by Muslims. The National Commission on Cattle set up by the Vajpayee Government in 2002 asserts "Cow slaughter in India first started around 1000 AD when various Islamic invaders came to this country.." (introductory chapter, para 25). The works of eminent historians showing how beef was an integral part of the dietary preferences of ancient India are brushed aside as the "propaganda of Leftists."
Swamy Vivekananda in a series of lectures published in volume 3 of his collected works had this to say: "You will be astonished if I tell you that according to the old ceremonials, he is not a good Hindu who does not eat beef. On certain occasions he must sacrifice a bull and eat it..." Again: "There was a time in this very India without eating beef no Brahmin could remain a Brahmin...in time it was found that as we were an agricultural race, killing the best Bulls meant annihilation of the race. Therefore the practice was stopped and a voice was raised against the killing of cows..."
The rewriting of history goes along with falsehoods about the realities of the present. Khattar's comments were deliberately aimed against Muslims when it is well known that more than Muslims or Christians in the North East, beef is the dietary preference of a substantial section of Hindus too. The Commission report also reluctantly admitted (para 167) that "extreme poverty and customary practices in the coastal areas and among some sections of scheduled tribes, scheduled castes and other backward castes also make them beef eaters." Clearly the issue of beef consumption also has a class and caste dimension.
But such is the power of the Goebbelsian lie that after Dadri, when Lalu Yadav said that Hindus too are beef eaters, he was so aggressively attacked by the BJP that he felt it was better to deny he had ever made such a comment!
The communal and divisive mobilisation also helps to conceal the utter hypocrisy of the anti cow slaughter campaign. The demand for a total ban on slaughter of all cattle even those who are legally "fit for slaughter" is in total contrast to the plight of such cattle.
According to the cattle census of 2012, there are 53 lakh stray cattle including cows, bullocks and bulls. These cattle have been turned out by the peasants who own them because it is not economically viable to look after them. On a conservative estimate, maintenance of a dry cow or useless cattle will cost a hundred rupees a day. This is precisely why in an earlier judgement the Supreme Court had held that a " total ban on slaughter of useless cattle which involves a wasteful drain on the nation...cannot be justified."
The plight of such stray cattle, including dry cows, slowly starving to death or dying because of ingestion of toxic wastes including plastic does not however move the Hindutva forces. In states, where they are in power such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, the numbers of such stray cattle are large. At an all-India level, the minimum cost of feeding 53 lakh stray cattle would be around 20,000 crores rupees a year at 100 rupees per head. This is more than the entire amount allocated for the Scheduled Tribe Sub Plan in this year's budget. But the concern for the cow does not stretch to finances. In Haryana, for example Mr. Khattar gives only 40 rupees per head of cattle to registered gaushalas. Since these gaushalas also include milch cattle which require a different more expensive diet, the useless cattle even in gaushalas starve to death.Such is the hypocrisy of the Hindutva right.
India does not need a national anti cow slaughter law. It does not require laws that determine dietary preferences of its citizens. It has other priorities it should be addressing such as being the country with the highest malnourished population in the world.(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

In Bengal and Kerala they ran a government that committed atrocities on common people and stifled any opposition to their rule. Mamata Banerjee was beaten up by left front goons.

                            @Arudra Dharma: No religious texts in sanatana dharma has ever told that beef eating isnt permissible!! Only Atharva veda warns raw meat and human flesh not to be consumed. Stop your stupidity. and for me i am a saraswat brahmin.

                            Let me tell you, Sanathana Dharma is one which you people call as Hinduism, lives very closely with the nature. It has revived itself and turned more freindly to nature. In your own message, you have written what Swami Vivekananda has said. Sanatana Dharma or Hinduism has identified that killing of bullocks are cows is dangerous to nature and raised the voice against killing them. And we are still following that.<br/><br/>
Another argument you said is "Dry cow" is completely illogical, If we can encourage Bio-fertilizers and Bio-Gas, this will not have burden to farmers. Leving out a dry cow is like leaving your parents when they are not earning anymore, which is a brutal and done by psychopaths.<br/><br/>
No farmer will ever feel like that for a cow or bull, because, he very well know the importance of them.<br/><br/>
The human civilization, would not have been there, if there was no cow or bull. Think....<br/>
I support complete ban on Beef...<br/><br/>
Why do not people respect the sentiment of the people...Where is the freedom...for us. Congress has sold the Indian culture to west in the name of Freedom...In my view, there has been never a freedom.<br/><br/>
Freedom for India means, freedom for the people who lived here, who flourished here...and those people are from Sanathana Dharma...<br/>
Sanathana Dharma has lot of religious tolerance...if there would not have been a secular India...<br/>
As a respect to that, please respect the views of Sanathana Dharma...Ban Beef eating....respect the Cow and Bull...

                            But one should not forget the reason of wide spread intolerance in the country. This is because of the open appeasement of the political parties to minorities (better read Muslims) over decades ignoring the voice and needs of the majority in the name of vote banks. The parties like congress and Samajbadi do nothing more than appeasing the minority in the name of vote bank. Come to Assam, see if you are a Bangladeshi Muslim you get all the benefits of government, but the son of the soils tribal peoples are methodically evicted from their own lands. They are deprived even from the basic benefits given to a citizens. Ms. Ayyub, I have seem myself in my 4 plus of decade of life how the Bangladeshi villages are mushrooming and even sometimes suddenly evolved overnight. In the name of environment protection, you evict the tribal but welcome the Bangladeshi in places like Kaziranga National Park. This is all done by the very part who calls itself as 'secular'. I will not be surprised if, Assam become another burning spot of such intolerance. Do not blame only the 'right wing'. They were created by the so called 'secular'. India really lost the opportunity to become a truly secular

                            China is nature-deputed neighbor of India. In 1962, some unwanted incidents occurred in India-china border, which could have been avoided by proper diplomatic intelligence. However, in 1965, when Indian army reached Lahore, an important city of Pakistan, India-china border remained peaceful. In 1971, when Indian army reached Dhaka, the then capital of East Pakistan, India-china border remained peaceful, calm and quiet. In 1993 India-china border agreement is signed. The agreement is such that both sides are supposed to continue with their CLAIM, but nobody will take any ACTION and status quo will be maintained.  So, presently India-china border is peaceful calm and quiet. One should be realistic before fabrication of fictions and unrealistic story of PROBABLE ATTACK FROM NORTH or story of SINO-PAKISTAN AXIS.

                            @Arudra Dharma: You are typical hate spreader with near zero understanding about the topic. You talk about "Dry Cow". Cow owners in cities never feed their cows. They release cows on streets. I often see hungry cows feeding on rubbish and even plastic bags. Where is your so called respect? You also ask others to respect your opinion but you don't have any respect for others. I am a vegetarian but if someone wants to eat beef I am not going to kill him as VHP goons like you are doing. Don't talk about Bio-fertilizers or Bio-gas without knowing anything about it. If every farmer follows your advice and use only cow dung and urine to fertilise farms you and many of your goons will not get food even once a day. So stop this verbal diarrhea without understanding the issues.

                            Swami Vivekananda also turned away some Marwari gentlemen, who visited him for donation for building gaushala. He told them that in a country where there are so many hungry children, why should I pay for feeding cows????? He then sarcastically told them that, this is what can be expected from the sons whose mother is a bovine, to this the gentlemen misunderstood that Swami Vivekananda is praising them.

                            Mrs Karat, red meat consumption be it beef , pork, lamb, etc has been on a consistent decline in most western countries. Not only is the fat content an issue but its digestive by products are now linked to formation of artery clogging plaque. Given the status of heart disease as a major killer i would argue beef eating is a public health issue as well and a ban on this issue isnt completely out of order

                            Brinda I do agree when leaders do loose talk their followers do the same. This example was et by you people only. You always bad mouthed the Hindu society and questioned its practices but never did the same for any other religion. Being leader if you did it, the followers also felt it is their right to do that in the last 70 years it has become a culture to do anything against hindus. This has finally started breaking the tolerance or a tolerant religion and slowly intolerance is creeping in which is very dangerous. But even today you are writing against hindus only but never against others why. You are only igniting this problem more. Be careful you will be held responsible for India becoming like a taliban state. Hindus have started loosing patience and the result is this now.

                            Madam is intelligent and smart in condemning BJP and calling they hypocracy. When Chinese army comes into our borders and occupies them, NO ONE IN COMMMUNIST PARTY EVEN WHISPER IN PROTEST OF THE CHINESE ACTION. oh! our communists are secular and hence cannot condemn Chinese communist party or army isnt it. Never mind, do not hear Indian commmunists condemn Pakistan at all even as Pakistan humiliates the bodies of dead Indian soldiers. Why only attack BJP and keep silent on Chinese army entereing into our borders and silent on PAkistan by Indian secular communists. Oh! ifyou are secular you can selectivey choose isnt it.

                            Take this for hypocrisy: Communism was the leading ideological cause of death between 1900 and 2000. The 94 million that perished in China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, Afghanistan, and Eastern Europe easily (and tragically) trump the 28 million that died under fascist regimes during the same period. During the century measured, more people died as a result of communism than from homicide (58 million) and genocide (30 million) put together. The combined death tolls of WWI (37 million) and WWII (66 million) exceed communism's total by only 9 million.<br/><br/>
Would Brinda give up communism?

                            Brinda, you and your christian bosses would say " cattle population is increased " but your christian missionaries friends would say " christian population is lowered or at still at 2.3% in whole india " one of my indonesian friend involved in christian missionaries told me that in indonesia christians are 13.2% but we will always tell people of indonesia christians are just 6% in total otherwise muslims would wake up. same strategy is used by missionaries in india to give false information. i had many christian friends from all over south india .Each one from different region would always tell same worded message as if taught by church father to them. if they come across a Brahmin  friend, they would say " many persons from your community is coming to church" and " many persons belonging to your community are eating  beef" These sort of false information reach all people and become the talk of media people to circulate this news in big way. Brinda is not only a communist but also working for a christian media and institution to denigrate hinduism.

                            Please ignore Brinda Karat's comments since she is irrelevant in Indian politics. She and her party do not have anything to do it other than creating confusion in the minds of citizens. When the country is moving forward they are trying to pull it back and are not able to digest the success of NDA.

                            The problem is that the issues which are linked with sentiments of various belief systems are difficult to debate openly. It is unfortunate that humanity even in 21st century has not evolved yet. In this world, millions of human beings that include small innocent childrens  are suffering and dying due to poverty, hunger, lack of medical facilities, and economic and social injustice. I never noticed that any religious organisation or so called religion has ever shown any senstivity to tackle those issues. It is high time to debate all issues related to human life in a rational and scientific way. Human history, and on going conflicts because of religious senstivities all proves that organised religions or belief systems have already done enough damages to huamanity that include wars, violence, superstitions, and human division that resulted into poverty, backwardness, and unbearable misery. Humans are one race - should stay in harmony with this beautiful and vast nature.

                            Brinda Madam, you are also a party to all these non-senses.  In the name of Secularism, you people (communist, congress, the dravidian lot and others) were butchering and offending majority community for years.  Now, a party that has fights for majority rights has come to power.  Now, tell me where it originated?  Was there a BJP seat before 90s?  It is the secularists that polarized the vote and created this monster.  It is better for political parties to respect the culture of land and propagate harmony rather than proliferating casteism, ethnicity etc.,  True that Modi came to power with development vikas agenda and what is happening now is total non-sense.  But, you are also to be EQUALLY BLAMED for this debacle.

                            Hindu Fundamentalists and BJP by demolition of Babri Masjid divided Indians into two communal groups. The literates have judged the aftermath consequences. Now they are dividing Indians into Vegetarians and Non-Vegetarians by passing laws which stregthen support to such terrorists to kill Muslims in the name of beef ban. The motive behind this is to develop hatred, revenge, ultimately communal clashes on beef issue. If cows are holy all over the world they would have started international cow protection movement. Only Indian cows are holy for them. If so the BJP Govt. must import unholy cows from the neighbouring SARC countries favouring Food Security Act.

                            Religions in the Indian subcontinent have evolved through the teaching of sages, rishis and saints who practiced rigorous penance and taught various techniques of meditation to their disciples. Their  effort was to understand the nature of 'human conciousness' and the mysteries of birth, death and suffering in a scientific manner. Ideas of 'karma', 'dharma', 'yoga' etc. are all based on these scientific investigations by these sages and saints. Some of these sages and saints may have acquired greater knowledge than others (just as some modern scientisits are able to contribute greater insights than their colleagues). And, there will also be a natural heterogeneity in the quality of disciples. That is why there are so many sects, customs and practices in India associated with various religions that have originated here. Nonetheless, they all share certain common aspects with respect to ideas of karma and dharma. If one is truly modern one must try to find out (through comparative studies) what are the highest teachings of the saints and sages. If they have recommended certain dietary restrictions we must also try to understand the reasons for this. Only then can we become truly modern in our outlook. Let us not allow modernity to be defined by atheists, communisits or any other shallow political outfits.

You brought very good point about others, before slamming others can you please look at the face of your party? What about your goons in West Bengal and their crimes against public? Why your party is downsized to pigmy size? It is very easy to criticize others. Have you ever reacted when majority sentiments were hurt? Have you felt sad about Kashmiri pandits? Indian public rejected Communist parties, but still you are hanging on shamelessly. Can you mention few of your achievements towards India's pride? Don't say that I belong to BJP or Congress, I have every right to question you pseudo seculars.

                            1947- Division of India on communal lines.  The mindset that created partition is the same that is crying today of religious intolerance, bigotry.  The elites of that time, Nehru, Gandhi, Jinnah were incompetent &amp; played in hands of British to divide India.  The same intellectual &amp; elites are returning their awards our of sheer myopic &amp; misplaced notion of India of 21st century.
