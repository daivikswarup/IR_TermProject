Headline::::India's Obsessive Spending on Defence



DateTime::::2015-04-20T20:42:00+05:30



(Phiroze Vasunia is Professor of Greek at University College London and the author, most recently, of  'The Classics and Colonial India' (Oxford, 2013).
Arms manufacturers of the world, rejoice. The government of India is your loyal friend. Not just this government, but the previous government too - the UPA as well as the NDA.
 
According to a study conducted by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, India topped the list of weapons importers and accounted for some 15 per cent of worldwide arms imports from 2010 to 2014. Five of the 10 biggest arms importers in this period were in Asia, including China (5%), Pakistan (4%), South Korea 3%), and Singapore (3%). Imports are only part of the picture of the global arms industry, of course, and the countries that had the highest levels of military expenditure in 2014 were the USA, China, and Russia. India was placed seventh on that list, with spending at $50 billion or 2.4 per cent of GDP, an increase of 39% between 2005 and 2014.
Signs of the government's thirst for arms acquisitions were evident when Narendra Modi declared during his visit to France that India would purchase a number of Rafaele jets for roughly $4.3 billion. On the heels of that development came the disclosure that the US Secretary of Defence, Ashton Carter, would be flying in to New Delhi in May to close the sale of Apache and Chinook helicopters, worth some $2.5 billion. The figures are staggering, though not by the standards of military expenditure, and there will be other such announcements in the months and years ahead since India cannot manufacture the weapons that its leaders insist upon.
The current government wants to cut defence imports, but not reduce military spending. The Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, announced in his budget speech that defence spending would actually increase by 11% to Rs. 246,727 crore in 2015-2016.  The defence share accounts for almost 14% per cent of the overall central government budget for the year 2015-16. With so much to play for, it's no wonder that Anil Ambani said in March that he wanted to make Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering the nation's largest defence manufacturer. "This is a unique opportunity for Reliance Group to participate in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' programme for the high growth defence sector," he added, just in case the message had not come through. You may think of the military-industrial complex as an embarrassment, but for business tycoons it's an "opportunity" to embrace openly.
 
The question is: should India devote such a large part of its budget to the military? The issue is not only financial, but moral and political. While spending on defence increased, the budgetary allocation for health was reduced by 5.7 per cent to Rs. 33,152 crore. Would the money given to defence not be better spent on the development of public healthcare, education, affordable housing, and infrastructure projects? What's surprising is how little discussion there appears to be in the national media about these levels of defence spending. In fact, you're far more likely to read editorials claiming that the Indian army needs to spend crores on "modernization" and newer technology than articles arguing for a reduction of the military budget.  Modern hardware adds to the spectacle on Republic Day in front of guests such as Barack Obama (who presides over a country that has by far the largest military budget in the world), but perhaps it's time to set aside these archaic displays of military might and ask whether it's necessary to spend so lavishly on machines of death in the first place.
 
Increased levels of military spending have not made India a safer place to live. The greater the levels of militarization in the region, the more likely it is that countries will go to war with each other, as countless experts have pointed out. The more habitually the armed services are pressed into service within India's boundaries, the more often will they take the lives of Indian citizens. We do not need a government that is going to invade or bomb another country. Nor do I think we have one. What we need is a government that tries to engage in constructive dialogue with others, builds up links through political and cultural diplomacy, understands the reasons for dissent within India, and seeks to learn why people remain unequal and in poverty. You cannot bomb into submission Pakistan, China, Sri Lanka, Kashmiri insurgents, terrorists, and Maoists.
 
North America and western Europe are in no position to offer lessons to others on the subject of military spending, but defence spending actually fell in 2014 in these parts of the world. Italy cut its defence budget by 27% between 2005 and 2014, France by 3.2%. Even in the USA, military spending has decreased annually since 2011. In the UK, where a national election is scheduled to be held in early May, some political parties have openly called for an end to the continuous nuclear deterrent known as Trident, and the subject is fiercely debated in the public sphere. Both the incumbent, David Cameron, and the leader of the opposition, Ed Miliband, say they are committed to Trident, the replacement of which is likely to cost 15 billion pounds to 20 billion pounds and which the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament refers to as "immoral, potentially genocidal and strategically irrelevant". Yet, it is interesting that the UK figure of military spending in 2014 is a reduction of 5.5% in the period from 2005. Also significant is that both the Conservatives and Labour give evasive answers when they are pressed about the cuts they will make to the military after the election: their evasiveness on the issue means that cuts in defence spending are certain. It is almost assured that regardless of which party or coalition of parties comes into power after the election, Britain will not meet NATO's guidelines and will not commit to spending 2% or more on defence.
 
In the late fourth or early fifth century, Vegetius, a functionary in the Roman imperial bureaucracy, composed a treatise in Latin on military matters that became widely influential in the European Middle Ages and the Renaissance. His most famous sentiment, and the one that is quoted more often than anything else he wrote, is that those who want peace should prepare for war. The phrase is popularly rendered as "If you want peace, prepare for war" (si vis pacem, para bellum), and versions of this have been adapted as a slogan by military outfits all around the world from the Royal Navy, to battalions in the US Marine Corps, to training schools in South Africa. Yet, in its context, the statement by Vegetius reads more as a justification for his work than an exhortation to strategists and generals.
 
In relation to India and Pakistan, economists who seek an opening up of trading relations have reformulated Vegetius' phrase to say: "If you want peace, prepare for trade."

                            A weak country cannot speak peace or cannot preach peace. India always and will  be a nation who will only raise her voice upon provoke.We need to keep ourselves battle ready and a modern battle cannot be won with swords, shields or archery. <br/>
The Raising power of Dragon is a biggest threat in this area of Asia.<br/><br/>
Countries who are preaching peace (US,France, Germany) or in the country the author is currently in (UK) they are having the biggest campaign running and billions of dollars involved across the globe for stabilizing peace and democracy in some most worst and war ridden places in this World. Peace at the price of War and what and hypocrisy is that??<br/><br/>
India is spending and will spend more in terms of replacing their aging fleet of ships/air crafts or tanks and which are necessary and dire need of the hour.<br/>
You always have to be battle ready as or should have just as much as muscle to make the region stabilize. <br/><br/>
A country with military might can talk peace and preach peace.We all know the war globally is a joint campaign by the cash rich oil companies and global arms  dealers who are a lookout for newer market to sell their arms and weapons.<br/>
Why don't you preach the same to US? and other European nations? who are armed to teeth with nuclear weapons and ready to drop them at minute notice?<br/><br/>
"You cannot bomb into submission Pakistan, China, Sri Lanka, Kashmiri insurgents, terrorists, and Maoists" and this kind of kiddish lines are not expected from a professor like your merit.<br/><br/>
Last but not the least hope we all remember, Once there lived a big poisonous snake in a field near a village. It used to bite anybody who dared enter the field and so nobody went there.<br/><br/>
One day a Saint came to the village. Villagers told him not to go to the field where the snake lived. But since the detour would cost him a lot of time the Saint decided to go through the field anyway. Soon the snake approached him with the intention to bite, but as he neared he was overpowered by the spiritual energy of the Saint. When the Saint saw him he advised the snake not to bite anybody and the snake agreed.<br/><br/>
After a few months the Saint was on his way back and he decided to check on the snake. When he found him he was shocked to see his state. He was all beaten up and nearly dead. Since the snake had stopped biting, the village boys had thrown stones at it and nearly killed him.<br/><br/>
The Saint told the snake, "Look, I told you not to bite, but who told you not to hiss?"

                            Another of those ignorant and air-headed analysts. Indian defence spending as a percentage of her GDP is still low and is in the 2% range.The author cites UK!IN fact they should halve their defence spending and give it to their NHS. Most of UK defence spending is for gallivanting around the world holding the coat -tails of US in some long lost imperial quests.    India's neighborhood is among the most dangerous in the world with an assertive, expansionist China on the one hand and an unstable,terrorist state Pakistan on the other.India does not go romping around the world with its forces and uses them only for self-defence. The analyst can also ask Pakistan why it does give India MFN status to boost trade. After all he is hankering on trade,economic relations.Is he so intellectually challenged not to see trade,economic relations are  also part of the strategic security planning on nations and that Pakistan and China are using it so to further their national security goals.So what is Indian supposed to do?Listen to your fancy ,hollow parable and quotations that cost nothing to throw around and hope for the best.

First understand that your entire logic only works if the whole world thinks the same way, not just one country out of 194.

                            One more peacenik who does not understand the basic realities of national-security. India is not stocking up its defence for World war 3 (Although if that day were to come, I'd like India to have a lot more than "peace" and "good thoughts" to offer its citizens as protection). India has a strategic interest in our neighborhood. All international trade, especially maritime trade is a a bit like the wild-west where countries have to fight(covertly and sometimes overtly) to keep their turf. The only way in which defense spending can be curbed is when the diplomatic and trade ties between countries give rise to alternative avenues for negotiation and posturing(like trade sanctions and such). This is in a sense what the BJP govt is trying to do, by strengthening SAARC and BRICS. Eventually, when we become more like the European union, India will be able to bring down its defense spending. And one more point. I hope you are joking when you talk about how we can't bomb Kashmiri-separatists and such. Because, bombing your own people would be genocide and that's the sort of thing that democratically elected govts tend to never do. Either you are casually musing or have absolutely no clue what you are talking about.

                            It is rather stupid to compare indian defense spending with NATO members as US does most of the heavy lifting for them, in effect american tax payers subsidize german,french defense. I do agree that we should have some reasonable cap on our defense spending and i think we should try and build political consensus on targets for every decade as percentage of gdp , to be fair i think 2.3% doesn't sound as bad as you make it out to be.

                            Wasn't this how USA bankrupted USSR? By increasing the defence spend, announcing Star Wars etc? USSR was forced to match &amp; they bankrupted themselves. Wont hurt if India manages to do the same to Pakistan. Take one out &amp; we will deal with China later. The problem is most of the defence budget goes into salaries &amp; we have the useless DRDO, HAL &amp; the likes who never manage to produce anything. China was a bigger arms importer &amp; was behind India in launching a plane. The HAL Kiran was launched in early 70s. We produced nothing after that. Today China produces dozens of world class fighter jets &amp; our Tejas is still a dream.

                            Good research in parts but the author has complete disregard to the realities of life here. The comparison with the European countries (in terms of decrease in their spending) is completely unfair. We, in India, live in the most hostile neighborhood imaginable. <br/>
I can appreciate the spirit of the author but lack of his appreciation of any kind to the realities and hard facts is unforgivable. An honest comparison of changes in India's defence spending would be to the trends of EU Countries' spending during the cold war era. Europeans don't need to protect their borders like we do, unfortunately for India. It's like we are never going to be satisfied with anything any government does for the country or its people. We are the same people who criticise the government for their defence spendings and then rip them apart for any attacks sponsored by our neighbors or other anti-social elements.<br/>
Won't it be nice to just sit back and support the government of India for a change? Let's just try doing that for a while and see if the results are any good or not? Rather than just mindless, factually wrong criticism of every single thing they do? <br/>
But then its probably your professional requirement to have a certain number of articles published annually. However, even so, won't it be nice to at least do a qualitative analysis of the topic and the facts rather than just mindless analysis of numbers? But then its just my opinion!

                            India lives in rough part of the world sourranded by enemies. If it does not have adequate defense capability, it will be ruled by some other nation. Look around the world and any big successful country has military as well as economical might. India is next in line to be successful country. It can only become one if it has military might as well as economic. It is trying in correct method. This author belief is in nehru's idea that India does not need military and everyone knows what happen to it 1962. People who don't learn from the history are doom to fail.

                            whilst it is true that India spends a material portion of its funds on defence hardware annually, it is also true that such spending is a natural consequence of the geopolitical circumstances concerning India. The defence cut examples cited (Italy, France, UK &amp; USA) are not relevant to India's circumstances as none of the said countries' neighbours is actively attempting to invade / wage war against them. Also, Italy, France, UK &amp; USA didn't cut defence budget when there was an active nuclear threat against them (reference: cold war era). Whilst it may be true that we cannot bomb Pakistan / China into submission, it is also true that we should have credible minimum deterrence / second strike capability in line with our no first use policy. The military industrial complex may actually be a good thing as it will spur investment, innovation and employment generation by Indian private sector in defence sector and also reduce India's dependency on overseas military hardware suppliers. As to diplomacy / trade, a credible minimum deterrence / second strike capability is never an impediment to diplomacy / trade.

Can the author ask  British / American govts.  to provide India with their security cover and vow to protect India's territory against all external attacks  like  they offered  Japan ? When faced with attacks,  India will have to defend itself.......The defence spending in India has actually been down, even the funds allotted are not spent...so at the end of the year, India spend relatively lower amount...and what is wrong if India tries to establish a local defense industry ?  It will provide jobs to many people and in future Indian cos. could be exporters of weapons...NDTV should not waste space for such articles..

                            Another left leaning liberal nut. Before writing any article he should have considered two FACTS. India is the ONLY major country in the world that shares borders with two nuclear weapon states (China and Pakistan) and is very close to a third nuclear power (Russia). It has been attacked by China and Pakistan. On that basis alone India should be spending many more billions on defense. But defense now accounts for less than 2.5% of the GDP when it was 3.5% in 1985 under Rajiv Gandhi. All other countries spend a lot more as a percent of GDP. India is nowhere near the top 10.

The same is the case with UK....No one can attack UK from the SEA , still they spend so much on defense, also to intervene in other countries' affairs !

                            "Air-headed" is the correct characterisation! Why don't people like this urge the failed state, Pakistan, and the overly aggressive state, China, to practice and "prepare" for peace. India, which had bitter experiences from these two needs to be on its guard and does not need such sermons!

                            Who is this Greek Professor? Never heard of his talent in strategic and defense matters. Europe had to cut its defense spending because it had to feed the citizens who are lazy and do not want to work. 30 hour working week in France. Can anyone imagine such lazy citizens? In USA, an average Silicon Valley worker works 50 to 60 hours. Double the EU productivity. Swedes don't want to work and they write all these unnecessary peace documents. It is like all those people who spend their time writing literature. What is a linguist's contribution to GDP when he writes a poem? ZERO. Is there a utilitarian value for literature. Very little and only for a select few. The world does not collapse if there is a general ban on literature for a quarter century. The guys from these Swedish institute write literature and are being poetic. <br/><br/>
Nations procure weapon systems because power comes from the strength of the military and a nation's ability to project power and actually projecting its power. Europeans should shut up and start working. Their ancestors were looting their colonies and the current generation with all this ancestral loot does not work but preaches. To all Europeans, please cultivate some work ethic and start working hard like in Silicon Valley.

                            On the western side we have a neighbouring country who thinks nothing of sending suicide squads of terrorists who kill innocent civilians, and one that actively encourages desperate separatists in our country to perform wanton acts of terrorism in various parts of the country.  On the east we have a major super power with a track record of going against this country's interest.  On the southern side we have an island nation openly inimical to India, and racked by terrorism itself.  So what do you do, Mr.Vasunia, sing love duets&gt;</div>

When you have neighbors like china and Pakistan there is no way India can sit in delusion that nothing will happen.<br/>
We had such PM once who snubbed Army chief when he went for funds saying we are non-aligned nation. Then came 1965 china war when we lost war on both western and eastern fronts. they took Aksai chin and went back from easter front(which is part of arunachal Pradesh). Now they are demanding most of arunachal Pradesh. Pakistan's greed and aggression is well documented in history, the moment you close your eyes on border a kargil will happen or a Mumbai will happen.

                            Hi Prof. Vasunia:<br/><br/>
Great article. But as many of us outside India know , India is a peculiar country and the resident Indians' thought process is very different.<br/><br/>
For example, we haven't seen a single Indian leader or citizen group  talk about the single biggest calamity that is ahead - population explosion. With close to 20M children born every year and urban population set to double in a  couple decades, one can only imagine the magnitude of the problem. For most people (I have seen even undergrad students in other countries say this), it is common sense - you simply can't produce enough jobs when tens of millions are born into poverty.<br/>
No economist has ever done this in human history.<br/><br/>
As an example, China pressed the brakes with the one child policy forty years back. But for some reason, no Indian politician or bureaucrat thinks it necessary .<br/><br/>
It is a similar story with defence spending. India could simply become aligned to a reliable larger power and use the money to help make lives better for its citizens. But for whatever reason, it is not happening.<br/><br/>
Like what Amartya Sen and others suggest, everything is uncertain. Sad story for a great civilization .

                            'The greater the levels of militarization in the region, the more likely it is that countries will go to war with each other, as countless experts have pointed out.'.  Utter rubbish.  Did NATO and the Warsaw Pact go to war?  Have Britain and France gone to war since Waterloo? It would be truer to say that had India not had a deterrent, conventional or nuclear, both, Pakistan and China would have smashed the living daylights out of us.  Nobody in the world would wish to forego spending on worthwhile causes and spend, instead on the military.  However, our circumstances are such that we do need to guard the very nation state that others seek every opportunity to destroy.  I am sure the author would like to leave every window and every door in his house open; I wouldn't advise it though, there are very many bad people there.  Similarly, there are very many bad nations around!

                            I always find these air-headed analysts amusing. We can reduce our military preparedness, but then we have to rely totally Chinese goodwill if they resort to some military misadventure in Arunachal or Kashmir area. If you think the 'world' will come to our aid, you are deluding yourself.<br/><br/>
This sort of flippant, high-school mindset exists in a lot of bone-heads who write these pieces and look at and admire themselves in the mirror. The funny thing about the piece - "engage in constructive dialogue with others, builds up links through political and cultural diplomacy". This is the sort of bullcrap that you can find in a freshman's resume.

The Author states the amount spent, but did he ever consider what is short in our army, there is shortage of helmets, obsolete weapons, useless flying coffins calld mig-21 etc.

                            Yes this is a fact that we need arms conflicts and war in order to purchase arms and run the world's arms industry. India is the most favorite every time with its increased defence budget. It made its people fool by saying that huge defence budget is for the sake of being indigenous. But on other hand, India is still dependent on others for the sake pf buying latest weapons. India is a developing country with a big question on poverty. But it still pursued such an expensive arms shopping business which is never ending obsession. Every day there are news arms with latest technology but there is no solution to Indian insecurity which made it to stuff more and more expensive &amp; lethal weapons.

                            I m in full agreement with the writer of this article that we should spend money on health care and education than spending thousand lakhs of money for military. But I want say one thing we need to decrease the man power of our military forces and instead use more technologies, I know many may say its wrong but I will its very right becoz 70 percent of defence budget goes paying salary and pensions to military force so at the end we have no money to buy or make new weapons or planes or invest in R&amp;D. See the recent Rafeal fighter deal cut short becoz its too costly and we can't afford it striaght way. More than buying a weapon it's cost heavily to maintain them, we have seen many accidents with our fighter planes and submarines. So it's better to make our military more balanced by reducing the number of troopes instead use that money to make a heavily weaponized and network centric force. What is the use of keeping a very large army with very weak guns like insas, so better reduce number instead increase more tecgnology. Many will say keep a small army will be very bad then just see how Isearl is defending themself with a less army but powerful technology and weapons. So the real point is not number but its technology.
