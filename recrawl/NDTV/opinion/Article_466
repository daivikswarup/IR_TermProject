Headline::::A Bihari at Harvard on the Cheating Controversy



DateTime::::2015-03-23T17:19:00+05:30



(Sanjay Kumar is currently a Mason Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University. Apart from his current Masters in Public Administration from the Kennedy School, he holds a PhD degree from JNU, New Delhi)
	Reading New York Times on Saturday, March 21 was not the same for me. As soon as I turned to page A9, I saw a photo captioned "Go to the Top of the Class" that said, "young people climbed the wall of a building on Wednesday to help students taking an examination in Hajipur, in the Eastern Indian state of Bihar. Education authorities said that 600 high school students have been expelled after they were found to have cheated on pressure-packed 10th grade exam".
	Having seen this story on NDTV few days ago, I was not very surprised with this as a news piece. But what surprised me more was the big-size photo in NYT. Many readers here, or even in India after reading about the story, would blame students and their parents. Cheating during exams is a major offence, but then this story or the photo is not the complete story. This is a byproduct of a big systemic failure in the state of Bihar, where various stakeholders are to be blamed and need to get into corrective measures.
	Coming from the same state and currently a Mason Fellow and a student of Public Administration at the Harvard Kennedy School, I thought that I should make an attempt to analyze about the issue. In 1987, I also took the same state-board school-leaving exam in a small town called Katihar. The situation was the same then as it is  now. It does not mean though that everyone was a product of the 'cheating system'. But this photo reminded me of the scene outside the examination halls which has not changed in last 27 years.
	Whenever I visit my hometown, I make it a point to visit my old school, Harishankar Nayak Government High School, just to be reminding myself of my old school days. We were free to attend or not to attend classes, taught by teachers who were more keen on giving us private tuitions than teaching us dutifully in class rooms. Parents were never bothered about the quality of education, but were only concerned about the output and their expectations of us; the government monitoring was non-existent. Overall, we were left to our own hard work and fate. One could well imagine the response of students at adolescence age in this circumstance. Many students who have gone through this type of education process including myself could well empathize with the circumstances which lead students to get into cheating.
	Historically, Bihar has been a major centre of learning, home to the ancient universities of Nalanda (established in 450 CE), Odantapura (established in 550CE) and Vikramshila (established in 783 AD). Bihar saw a revival of its education system during the latter part of the British rule when many institutions such as Patna University, Bihar College of Engineering, and Science College etc were started. But after independence, it could not retain its reputation or progress. In the recent past, Bihar's students have performed well in IITs and Civil Service Examinations, but these have been mainly those who went out of the state for preparation or went to the private schools. It tells us three things: first and foremost, Bihari students have talent but are unable to perform well within Government schools and colleges. Secondly, only those students are prospering whose parents have money or can afford to send their children outside the state and thirdly, it's not the students but the education system which is not delivering and is unable to create and maintain the right environment.
	The Government of India launched the Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyan or the National Secondary Education Mission as one of the flagships program in 2009. According to RMSA, Bihar has not only performed poorly but has been unable to utilize its allocated funds and in 2013-14, out of 315 girls' hostels approved, only three have been completed. 38 schools for coverage of vocational courses were cleared but no work has begun. A high drop-out rate of 30%  between classes 7-10 is an area of concern. There is a huge vacancy of teachers even against the RMSA approval. Teachers' training, critical for implementation of the mission and improving the quality of education, is very poor.
	In order to fix some of the problems, parents should come forward and get involved in the implementation of the programs and running of the schools. They should hold the teachers and education officials responsible. They should be part of the School Committees, which are generally headed by the local politicians who have no interest in education of students and have more interest in the power and money, which such position brings. The Government should reconstitute these Committees and better participation of parents should be ensured.
	Secondly, the teachers will have to be responsible and understand the fact that education is not a business. This is the backbone of our progress and prosperity. They are building the future of the society and thus should be committed to the role they are supposed to play. Private tuitions must be banned. It is unethical to teach the same students by charging fees and not teaching them properly at the school
	Bureaucrats and officials have a larger role and responsibility of making the system work. I remember that at some point, my school in Katihar was better than others because most of the children of the Government officials were studying in my school including the son of the District Magistrate. They had to send their kids to the Government School as they did not have any other option in the town and we did not have private secondary schools. Why can't we think of making compulsory for the Government officers to send their children to the Government schools? It sounds radical but this could be a game-changer.
	The media can also play a strong role by running campaigns to improve education system. Many social issues have been fixed by media campaigns in our country. Their role in highlighting the wrong-doings in the mid-day meal scheme, for example, is praiseworthy. But they should try to work closely with students and parents to highlight the shortcomings in schools on regular basis. This can be a great contribution from their side.
	Last but not least, politicians just cannot blame parents and students. Education Minister PK Shahi said on TV channels that the Government is helpless and parents should stop their children from cheating during the exam. The last few politicians in power did not pay the required attention the improving the education system in the state. They will have to rise above political affiliation and work together to improve the situation. They should understand that they have money to send their children outside the state for education or to the big private schools, which are thriving in the state. But their poor voters cannot afford this.
	I am sure that the next generation of Bihari students can prove their potential with the same vigor and hard work as we have proved in the past. They just need opportunity and the level-playing field.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Great to see a Fellow Mason take such deep note of the systemic failure into the system of Education. I believe that the caste based quota system is the one &amp; only reason for such blatant mishaps. We have people in power, administration &amp; education who have come from avert poor background and have suddenly become greedy to make money at every given instance. Also the poor pay packages for teachers, administrators, police and others at the helm of affairs in the society is one major reason for such steep deterioration in societal standards. In every other country the people in such positions are paid high so as to avoid corruption. The poor pay package is also the reason for poor research and development activities in our country. May be some day we realise this and change the situation for a better future of this country

                            I don't think one needs a Mason Fellowship to pin point the causes of the degradation of every sphere of life in Bihar. We Biharis know it very well. Some of us who are doing well outside the state have intentions to go back and make a change but are too scared to leave our comfort zones. I blame myself and my fellow educated Bihari youth equally as I blame our Bihari netas.

                            "Open Book" examinations are quite well known. Perhaps, La Loo was referring to them. Even if you give them the text book, they still would not know where to find the answers!

                            One doesn't really need the analyses of a Bihari babu whether from Harvard or anywhere else to see what is happening in that failed state.  To start with people shouldn't hark on about the ancient universities of Bihar; that was around 1500 years ago.  One should deal with the here and now!  The problem is that Bihar is dragging the rest of India into the gutter.  When corrupt politicians such as Lalu Prasad Yadav are regarded as heroes notwithstanding the conviction for fraud there is something amiss.  When in the absence of Lalu his wife Rabri Devi, an illiterate, is made Chief Minister, there is something amiss.  When opportunists such as Nitish Kumar make an alliance with corrupt characters such as Lalu and Mulayam Singh, there is something amiss.  Consequences of this failed state are hitting India hard.  Most of the major cities in India have slums where Biharis are found because the slums of say, Delhi are better than nothing in Bihar.  And yet, and yet, Lalu is courted by the likes of Sonia Gandhi, parliamentarians applaud his speeches as being funny, the rag tag group of Bihari MPs wield totally disproportionate power in the Indian Parliament (disproportionate that is, to the contribution of Bihar to the wellbeing of India)and we, the rest of India are given lessons on how to understand that what is happening in Bihar is justified?  There is no alternative but for the Union Government to take charge and impose draconian law and order policies.  If needs be, those attempting to cheat or aiding those cheating must be shot on sight.  Those involved in industrial scale corruption, such as Lalu must similarly be shot on sight.  It worked in China.  It will work in India.

                            I have seen some of the brightest students in my university coming from Bihar. They were not only good in academics but culturally active too. The issue here is not about cheating, but general lawlessness in Bihar. Cheating in exam is an outcome of lack of governance.

                            There can be no excuse for cheating. It is done knowing perfectly well that it is wrong and illegal. The surprise is that this state also produced the Super 30 success story. Bihar's recent scandal only tarnishes its old reputation for scholarship.

                            Being from Bihar i can't agree more with writer.There is deep deep divide among private and public schools in Bihar. Even the poor who understand the benefit of education go to private schools in spite of higher charges. Many students from Bihar you will find they have very good knowledge but lack confidence to speak their mind because of their unfamiliarity with English language.<br/>
I can say this easily that we are the best and we are worst and both are true depending on whether you are from private or public. There are exceptions off course.We have maximum number of IAS, PO's, IPS and very good number of doctors and engineers.

                            Very happy to see an NRI taking so much interest in the workings of a backward state in a developing country. However, it is very easy to sit in the US of A and preach. Nobody wants to work on the ground. Heck, even i don't want to work on the ground. So how do we magically get these teachers, police men, honest politicians etc? May be the gods can be of some help here? Since, gods have unlimited access to wealth, they should provide money to people to work on the ground. Yes, that will solve the problem. Most definitely it will. <br/><br/>
Now coming to the Mason's. Just take the example of Ghanshyam Tiwari MPA 2011. His great contribution was to get Nitish re-elected. Is that the best a Mason can do? Then, i am better of being Masonless.

                            A very good write-up, but it cannot be denied that what happened or what was allowed to happen was wrong.  This will create an impression in the minds of people throughout the world (not just India) about the genuineness of the academic credentials of the people from Bihar, who are intelligent, hardworking and efficient to cite positive traits.

                            The author may be right about the systemic failure of education system in Bihar, but his attempt to exonerate the students and the parents from the faults does not cut ice. As a matter of fact, they're also a part of the system that failed. I would say, the cleanup should begin from the top - by firing all the key education board officials.  Nitish Kumar said in other news that it makes Bihar look bad. He forgot that he has been the CM for several years since now and failed to take responsibility for the bade education ministry and the boards in the state!

                            What has any of this have to do with a systemic failure of the education system. Not using unfair means in an exam is a matter of personal discipline. Nothing condones such an activity. Saying we will not cheat only when the education system has improved is escapism and only leads to more such situations. Very typical!!

                            Who will bell the cat? I have sympathy with students and parents who cannot afford education outside Bihar we used to have Bihari Students as our tanents they used to tell us how parents borrowed money selling agriculture land etc for their education. All these leads to corruption and it represents the charactor of the people from states.   <br/>
Government of Bihar needs to reform and deliver improvement in controlling exams and recruitment of good quality teachers to do justice with talented students in their state.

                            As you have Masters in public administration, you could have touched on the topic of economics of cheating. 2000 - 3000 INR are collected from each student to ensure trouble-free cheating throughout the exam. This money is passed on from the school administration up till the CM of the state. The most conservative estimate would valuate the the amount at tens of crores. For a beemaru state devoid of adequate funds and support from the central government, it seems more than logical to create more and more matriculates, whose numbers act as the qualifying criteria for the eligibility towards loan from world bank/IMF.

                            This is more than 100% true what you have analysed the situation of education system in Bihar &amp; I too myself been the product of same system. I can remember my days that how difficult was it to navigate my career and somehow with immense help of my parent, friends and almighty I got the job of my choice. I feel very sad and sorry for my dear one who still have to confront the same situation and find it very difficult to help them in competing with their pear at national level for the career of their choice. I would like to add some point in your suggestion that the school should come under supervision of School committee. When you confront the administration to have a system like this they will quick to remind you that the same is already in place. Problem is all the member and head of school committee is sycophant of these so called education administrator be it minister, bureaucrat, official and for that matter people representative. All of them often collude with only to embezzle all resource or left it unspent if their way out of embezzlement is not found on term of their choice. One way to minimise it, could be that member of committee should be the parent of students having credential of being 1 to 10 in their respective class with at least 70% of attendance and electorate to select the committee should comprise only parent of student currently enrolled in school concern. Rest of the suggestion made by you is excellent but god knows these suggestion will find any place or not because real wherewithal to eradicate it is missing from current dispensation. They are once again fallen in trap of propagating false sate of affair &amp; crooked thinking only to deviate from larger good of public.<br/>
May God give enough courage to those aspiring student to find a place of their choice.

                            I can relate this very well as I was raised in Sahibganj, another small town in Bihar, and not far from the author's town Katihar where I got married. The situation was no different even in the 60's, albeit at smaller scale. The suggestions provided by the author are welcome. Parents do have to soul search and come forward to active interest in the education of their children.

                            Nice commentary! One important reason highlighted is corruption in teaching, cause is that these teachers have paid huge price for the job. Private tuitions are means to recover the cost. Private institution/ college/ schools /universities flourish on failure of govt education set up. In fact the education ministers in various states have stake in private institutions, who virtually gaurantee failure of govt institutions. I would like to point good quality govt schooling and basic health care is even answer to ongoing  religious conversion.

                            Same is the situation in my state, Madhya Pradesh, although the cheating process is not suicidal as we see in the above pic, but yes govt teachers are not interested in teaching students, all they want is private coaching, in private school since salaries are very poor, they don't have quality teachers. Thus when a student goes out for higher education like engineering, he has nothing but just certificates of school completion, concepts, learning nothing is there. Before opening more IITs, IIMs, quality of primary education should be rechecked. And the basic point is self awareness, if parents and students are happy or proud to pass the exams in such manner, even God can not save them.

                            "They just need opportunity and the level-playing field."  Yes sir, agreed. The students in Bihar have an opportunity....but the level-playing field is circumspect. Do you think a Bihari can pass any exam conducted outside of the state of Bihar. He/she can appear and pass the exam in Bihar only, but can be posted as an officer anywhere in the country, much to the displeasure of the people of the place where she/he is posted. We have enough examples on that......Bihar will take another at least 50 years to come to terms with civilization and then your suggestions might be considered. Until then, Bihar will keep "churning" out "civil servants with distinction" through "windows" like the one you see on the photograph.......Bhaiyya, paan chahiye ya khaini?

                            It has been like this in Bihar, UP and many northern states for many decades.  Except very few people who are really brilliant from here, majority of the people are extremely poor in comprehension, grasping and very basic language skills.  Many copy in the UPSC exams and become IAS officers.  These are the people who rule our country.  God bless us.  The system needs a complete revamp.

                            I can understand silence of politicians about population density. Why scholars are silent about population density. Question at the root is ? How many ? How many students can be managed in a class ? How many criminals can be handled by handful police? How many cases can be heard by a Judge? How many citizen can be managed in a ward? how many in a district? how many in the state ? <br/><br/>
High population density is working in favour of liars and gangsters. Liars are distributing false promise that they can manage and they can manage well. In order to cover their head, they are using caste as  shield. This is of course working for the so called democracy. Which is held hostage to the lawless families and family owned militants.<br/><br/>
Can democracy prevail in a Jam or stampede ? Either state will fail or democracy will fail. Like in Pakistan both have failed. Scholars of India please speak on population density.

                            We cannot simply blame quota System for what is clearly a blatant defiance against discipline and utter Moral irresponbility on the part of parents, students and School authorities.. This behaviour is not uncommon in India. It is displayed on our roads, when People knowingly ingore the traffic Signals and then laugh about it. It is very obvious in our corruption data by Transparency International. It can be seen in piles of garbage lying on the streets.. And one cannot forget the famous "donations" that are given proudly by parents to assure that their children become doctors.. It is everywhere. Bihar is not bringing India to the gutter, it is ofcourse this lazy, self depreacating attitude of "sab chalta hai" in India.

where is the district administration ?who monitors whether wrongly activity is happening in the school during the Exams . Where is the police ? So do not blame the students . The administrative people who are responsible to monitor that the exams are run properly were inefficient to do so . In simple terms there is no system .... Sad ...

                            Mr. Fellow Mason, would like to comment on Mrs Misa Bharati lie about the photographs at Harvard as a 'Speaker'??<br/><br/>
Do you still think that education system is to be blamed for that too? Basically, if you come from Bihar you always have the mindset to cheat? or does the education system is to be blamed for the mindset as well. Very easy to blame the system and not the parents who inculcate this.<br/><br/>
I am a product of the same education system but in a different state and we never cheated.<br/><br/>

                            Patna College was Oxford of East and Farady house of Science college had fearsome reputation. Patna Science,St Xavier's College Ranchi had better physics departments than IITs!First Plastic Surgery in country started from the then Prince of Wales Medical College,Patna. The things started going down the from 67 when Bihar assembly cobbled up anti congress coalition and Late Karpoori Thakur was the CM. Mass copying got social sanction and people started passing with Karpoori Division. The acting VC of Bihar University Nagmani tried to control it successfully.But subsequent political dispensation had no interest in education in Bihar. Laloo Yadav is the best example of Karpoori Division and what he feels about cheating in examination. The Bihari Students started fleeing to other states.Rest is history.

                            I also went to Harish uncle  Nalayak Government High School. The headmaster is the most illiterate person in the school and he was there because he was a dalal of some politician. You can't expect much from these kind of criminals who run the school.<br/><br/>
Corruption is the key here, you hire headmaster by corruption, you hire teacher by corruption. Corrupt people involve criminals. <br/><br/>
I quit going to school because, if you are regular at school, you might be a gunda. <br/><br/>
These politicians are so corrupt they can't do anything. They have their self interest in keeping the system corrupt, keeping the police corrupt.

                            Laloo destroyed the education system in Bihar during his rule because he thought that education benefits upper caste people. This brought a great change in the attitude of Biharis. Biharis known for their home sickness started moving out of state. Delhi University known for taking admission only on merit, now always has 30% students from Bihari. Today Bihari Students can be seen in all parts of India in huge numbers. Now a large number of Biharis get success in UPSC exams like IAS, IES etc. Large number of Biharis are taking jobs outside Bihar and as result of all this many young boys and girls are marrying out of state and out of caste. BAmong the grown ups, who has some capital, buys home in Delhi and lives out of state, many are even going out of country. Thanks to Laloo, he spoiled everything in Bihar, but Biharis are on progress and a big social change is taking place. Per capita income in Bihar may be low, but Biharis are earning good money outside the state. Due to lack of jobs even the labourers have migrated to other big cities and they are earning more money than what they could have earned within Bihar

                            What do you mean parents have to come forward and get involved in the running of the school. What the photo shows is a complete breakdown of the education system and a complete breakdown of law and order. When everyone is blatantly copying, you cant expect a parent to tell his child alone to be honest. The Bihar govt needs to restore law and order first. Conduct exams with strict invigilation and checks. After that lecture parents on the need to ensure their children are honest.

                            Students and parents who think that cheating in exam is not good can salvage the situation. When I was giving school final exam, cheating was not all that prevalent. However it so happened that in the room where I was giving exam, invigilator was showing laxity and I saw one boy copying from book and the invigilator did not object. Many others in the room were doing some other kind of cheating. Probably I was one person relying on my own wisdom and answering questions. The invigilator was impressed by me and came near my seat and asked my name as he did not know me. We used to go to other school for giving exams. After some time elapsed the invigilator developed some shame on himself because of me. I saw that he took the book from the boy who was cheating, took his copies and asked him to go, even though he did not take more stricy action. Seeing the laxity prevalent there, the boy pleaded with him to allow him some more time as he needs to answer some more questions. The invigilator told him that he has allowed him some time and he will be able to get pass marks. The invigilator told him my name and said that he will not allow the boy to answer all the questions and score like me who is writing answer on his own. I was surprised to hear my name in the melee, but was happy to see that my honest behaviour brought some shame in the mind of invigilator.

                            It's sad and disapointing that in Bihar such things still happen even as the time passed. The route of the problem is lack of good governance and the situation created by Lalu' Prasad. Even after the coming of Nitish Kumar, situation has not changed. The situation in government schools where teachers are less paid is another reason for this. Our government run organisations are very poorly run. For example schools, hospitals, railways. The government can also run its organisations efficiently if it eliminate political interference in its running. Many countries run government organisations more efficiently or as efficient as private organisation. So it is possible to run govt organisations efficiently.

                            None of your suggestions will work unless Bihar is brought under permanent police raj. The poor governance is a sad reflection on the people of Bihar. Media is guilty of giving so much space to idiots like Lalloo who actually embarrasses everyone everytime he opens his mouth. Even Modi does not mind rubbing shoulders with Lalloo at functions. Ofcourse Sonia Gandhi, Mulayam, etc all find him respectable.

                            It is good to see a response from A Bihari at Harvard. A very good and intellectual article from a Mason fellow, who found it very convenient to type it from his macbook in the comfort of an Air conditioned Villa. Blame it on others, we all find it very easy to do so. <br/>
Blame it on the poor govt officials whose per hour salary would be less that what you might be paying to your maid. it is very convenient to research on Public Administration and talking about administrative failure in one's native State. and it is very convenient to brag about one's legendary past , about all the nalanda and vikramshila etc while sitting in Harvard campus. <br/>
Oh I know why there are no more Nalanda and Vikramshila any more in Bihar, because some biharis, who could have made a difference left bihar. <br/>
PS: No hard feelings dear, if you are enjoying your life do enjoy just don't justify cheating. <br/>
also Nalanda University has opened again if you want to teach there.

                            @: @Anonymous: Cheating is akin to stealing. Yes the system is to blame but an honest person what ever the provocation will not cheat. It is not a prob;em restricted Bihar it is a problem across India especially the Hindi Belt (backward states UP Bihar MP, Rajasthan etc. The value system of being honest is dying because of intense competition. The Education needs serious overhaul and capacity creation to meet the huge pressure of a lot of talented students not able to study what they aspire to study resulting in unhealthy competition leading to cheat etc.

                            I see from your writing that you take pride in being educated at Harvard. It sure is one of the best in the world. Good job. I read the article and i have a few comments to make here:<br/><br/>
- How is the weather in United States?<br/>
- Are you enjoying the technological advancements in United States?<br/>
- Aren't you getting late to college/work/bed time/shopping time/TV Time/any other chores you have?<br/><br/>
Boy, you need to reflect a bit on what you say!! If the boys want to cheat, the onus is on them. <br/><br/>
DON'T SIT IN A COMFORTABLE PLACE AND WRITE ARTICLES WHICH RIDICULES THE NATION<br/><br/>
No one is to be blamed but the student who restores to cheating in an examination. It is very very comfortable to massage your ego by saying that you are a mason fellow and state to the world that you want to analyze the situation. Boss, your analysis is worse than a 6th standard guy in a Bihar school. The system here means students AND STUDENTS ALONE. Thats it. This shows that you have no idea about the system, except your leisure visit to your old school to get some more praises from the people you meet, after you say that you are from "HARVARD". PLEASE PLEASE GET A LIFE AND DONT BOTHER WRITING ABOUT SUCH TOPICS YOU HAVE NO IDEA ON. AND I REPEAT YOUR ANALYSIS SUCKS.

                            Whats the point and what is the solution to the problem! In my opinion , the Education system, where cheating is prevalent should not be totally based on written examination and bulk of the grading system should be given on oral examination. There will be pros and cons for this solution and majorly one could be favoritism . This can be prevented using some strict measures

                            Sounds very idealistic. The moment words like 'should' and 'must' is used in conveying a solution to a problem, it becomes apparent that the writer is living in a make-believe world.<br/><br/>
Moving on to a practical solution, I liked the suggestion of an open-book exam. Students will be forced to rake their brains to pass. And, it is something that can be implemented ASAP and immediate results can be seen.
