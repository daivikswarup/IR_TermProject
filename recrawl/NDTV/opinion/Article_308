Headline::::Why I Tweeted About Uber Driver Shiv Kumar Yadav by Nidhi Shah



DateTime::::2014-12-17T04:04:00+05:30




                                (Nidhi Shah is a chemical engineer by training who is passionate about bringing sanitation to the 626 million people in India who lack access to improved services.This endeavor brought her face-to-face with a rapist Uber cabbie and forced her to confront the dismal women's rights situation in her homeland.) On November 26th 2014, I ate lunch at the famed Paranthe Wali Gali in Chandni Chowk within the heart of Delhi. Unable to find a trustworthy metered taxi to transport me to the next destination, I decided to use Uber, which, just a few days prior, had come highly recommended by a female Delhiite. What transpired next was a long cab ride, during which I switched between looking up to see the cab driver staring at me, smiling creepily and examining my phone's map to make sure he wasn't taking me elsewhere. In my head, I stared back at him angrily, blurted "kya hain?" and asked him to stop. In reality, I did none of those. Why not? Was it the years of conditioning against saying anything to misbehaving men for fear of retribution? Was it the discomfort of confronting somebody? I suppose it was a bit of both. But, most of all, I wasn't convinced that doing so would make any difference. I thought of the words that had been iterated to me many a time, "it'll be over soon; just ignore it and it'll go away." These are the same words that compelled me to hide behind the driver's seat to avoid his filthy gaze instead of speak up.  At the end of my cab ride, Uber prompted me for feedback about the driver. I gave him 1 star ... had there been an option to give 0, I would have done so readily. Beyond the starred feedback, I quickly typed up that he had stared at me before rushing into my meeting. Soon thereafter, I see a headline about an Uber driver raping a woman. My thoughts immediately race back to that uncomfortable cab ride. Curiosity gets the better of me and I try to find a news story. Photo of a guy with a black mask over his head. I imagine whether the eyes through the mask could be the same ones that looked at me lecherously. I read more of the article. There's a name, Shiv Kumar Yadav. I quickly pull out my email receipt. Sent by Shiv Kumar Yadav.Blank. Expletives. Goosebumps. These three things, in order, comprise my response immediately following the realization that a week before he raped a woman, Shiv Kumar Yadav, rapist cabbie escorted me through Delhi. Had I been in his car alone, I might not have been lucky enough to escape. I didn't know what to do next as I didn't want to tell my family for fear of worrying them. Somehow, tweeting about the unnerving news, sending it out into emptiness - my Twitterverse - seemed comforting. Like screaming into space hoping somebody hears you and urges you to share what happened. And turns out you all did exactly that. You showed an interest in what I have to say because of what I went through and because of my response to the experience. Honestly, I simply took the opportunity provided to give feedback about a truly horrendous man and the uncomfortable cab ride he provided. In the aftermath of my discussion with news correspondents, I have had many conversations about what I think the future of India should hold. Sexual assault and harassment are all too common in India, and our attitudes in dealing with either have only made them worse. Many people have argued that these crimes are not unique to India. They come part and parcel with the human condition. Honestly, it is an irrelevant point to make. Let's talk instead of how to make India safer and more comfortable for everyone.Let's take back India from men like Shiv Kumar Yadav who terrorize many women without punishment. Ignoring creeps like him have emboldened them into becoming repeat offenders committing heinous crimes. But how do we report such people and ensure that proper corrective action will be taken? I would argue that the most convenient opportunity anyone had to report this particular man was through Uber.  Uber reneged on its contract with the people of India when it did not take my feedback about Shiv Kumar Yadav seriously. Inadvertently, it created a space for him to rape a young professional woman. While it might sound difficult, I think Uber's responsibility in the coming days will be to reform its feedback management system and to vet every single driver that they have hired through the service.But I hold, today, that Uber is not entirely the problem. Consider providers like Meru, EasyCabs, or just black and yellow taxis. Do you know how to provide feedback to these companies in case of unsatisfactory service? I certainly don't. Uber, to its credit, has provided a very important platform for its users to give immediate feedback about its service. Consider also that Shiv Kumar Yadav has had previous run-ins with the law and authorities and has been let off scot-free. In light of the above, my first suggestion for improvement is that companies, governments, and other such organizations with the means to affect larger-than-individual-scale change have the responsibility of opening up channels of feedback. The owner of a company, the minister of a department, a society president - those with power have an obligation to protect those without. A taxi company must allow passengers to comment on driver skill, safety, cleanliness, and character. Similarly, governments must allow citizens to speak up about crime and injustice. At the moment, such lines of communication are unknown, obscure, inaccessible, or unreliable, if not all of the above. This is unacceptable. For a society to improve, feedback must be woven into the fabric of its daily life.But, there is more to the equation. A simple invitation of feedback will not solve everything. Those who are affected by crime and injustice and ordinary citizens like you and me have a grave responsibility to communicate. I urge you all, today and from now on, to SPEAK UP. We must speak up when we observe immoral deeds. Don't take injustice sitting down. From what I know of this world, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. So, squeak for justice; give detailed feedback often. You might believe you need an army of people on your side, but you don't. This experience has taught me that the platforms to create change and incite national dialogue are already in place today and moreover that a single individual can trigger the above. The opportunities to provide feedback are becoming increasingly available and accessible. It is now our time to voice displeasure about the wrong in our society. It is now our time to take back India. Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Thank you so much for writing it so positively instead of blaming the whole of India and debating like our media to call it a unique problem to India. You avoided doing that and instead mentioned hope that we can take back India which is never truly possible with some responsible participation from every one.

                            India is a sex-starved nation. At present this is the first reason it is happening in our country. You can improve the law and order but rapes do happen in developed countries. Improving the law and order situation to what we have in developed country is a distant dream and i don't see that happening for another 50 years. You are talking about robust feedback system in a country which hardly has any system. I am sure your feedback about the driver would have gone in the trash. However, if you had the guts to take the complain to police station and spent some quality time to get him punished he would have been jailed the very same day and this incident could have been averted. Obviously you will be the lone fighter, nobody will be supporting you and you never know what could be the consequences. By writing this article i think you are just getting some instant publicity and nothing else. You are not helping in anyways to avoid another girl from getting raped in India. <br/><br/>
There are few things which if implemented right we can get rid of this kind of problem and this is a long term solution. <br/><br/>
a) There is definitely a decline in sex-ratio especially in north indian states like Haryana, UP etc... Who is responsible for this ? I am sure some women was involved in the decision making process of female foeticide. Had there been enough females it would not have been a male dominated society. Women would been seen in every position be it Police constable, Inspector, Lawyer, Collector etc.. Men would think twice before taking women for granted. <br/><br/>
b) Population control : I like the Idea 3G ad, when no other entertainment then population explosion. There are 100 cops for 100000 people !!! How does this equation work. I have seen signals with four traffic cops/inspector not able to control traffic in peak hours. No system can do it. We can't have 10000 cops to manage 100000 people but 100 cops will be enough for 10000 people. Current system in India can handle a maximum of 30-40 crore people. Scaling up the system require resources/money which we don't have but controlling the population explosion is something every individual can do and contribute to a better world for future generations.

                            Very well written. Don't we face that stupid gaze everyday from literates as well illiterates. Its baffling we need to teach our boys rather than making our girls understand. One more thing I am trying to understand is UBER model of business. How its drivers are making 90K and it is charging 12kmpl while Meru charges 23kmpl?

                            Would like to shoot such people in the head, but as a law abiding person I did not had a desire to acquire a gun illegally. (THEY practically don't allow to own guns legally, only people with political connection can.)

                            There should be a methodology to get feedback on the feedback you have given. It doesn't exist. The feedback given are used by the companies to enhance their reputation by discarding 1 star or factual comments. Otherwise how will the Customer Support staff grow in an organization. So the action taken by Customer Support group on the factual feedback should be taken into account while promotion is issued. May be one day we may see better human beings on road.

                            Yes, we must speak up against immoral or unethical acts<br/>
There are many immoral acts in society and there is no justification for committing and immoral act, whether it is against women, men, children, religions, faiths, communities, nations, races etc.<br/>
It could be any member of our community or a foreigner, no one is exempt. If they are planning to commit an immoral or unethical act they must be reported before it is too late.<br/>
There is NO justification for committing an immoral act against a human being

                            My suggestion here also why the police cover the faces of the criminals while taking them to court, while arresting them.....let people know the faces and it will definitely help others to recognize them in case they encounter with them anywhere while going in the bus, walking on road, taking cab, shopping, on outside tour etc. etc.<br/><br/>
Also an open data should be uploaded on websites, which can be accessed by any one before taking the services, just an example like companies for hiring driver/employe any staff, household for servant/maids, security personal etc. etc.<br/><br/>
main culprit is Police followed by judiciary, Police do not investigate properly and criminals get free and they commit crime again and again....and Judiciary do not close the case for years.....then come our so called human rights and mercy requests.. No one has faith in our police and judiciary.....ask any one means any one...off camera.... See the Nirbhaya Case....it was to be decided within a year and now its 2 years and still going.... and see...this man threatened for using the same rod.... you know what does this mean..... if the earlier culprit would have been hanged....this man I am sure, did not have use this word.....ah.... what else we can do....

                            I would like to go at the bottom of the issue. Is nuclear families are the reason? Is there more aggression in the society?  Is strong libido behind this? Is it done to prove (false) masculinity?  Therefore it appears to be more a psychological problem. The best thing is now it is not kept under cover. It is being reported by the person who has suffered. Gradually it will sink into men.

                            The improvement begins at the top. Speak up against your elected representatives if they don't work. And let this effect trickle down. To start with, I had voted for BJP MP L K Advani from my area. But all the roads in my area, Prahladnagar, are dug up for last 6 months. L K Advani hasn't bothered to be here again. Ahmedabad Muncipal Corporation isn't bothered either. The new CM is all corrupt and busy taking bribes. Next elections, all of us are going to vote you out Mr. Advani. And to everyone else in India, if he stands from anywhere else, don't vote for this old guy. He is useless. BJP - you will lose this seat. We didn't vote you for lifetime. Election will come back again in 5 years and sooner will come the assembly elections 2 years. We are determined not to vote for BJP again -from all of us here at Ahmedabad.

                            Nidhi, you have had been a plausible example that helped me in filing a FIR a few days back. It was a case of small theft in the car and as usual police claimed it as "non critical" crime to investigate upon or even lodge an FIR for.<br/><br/>
I literally accused them of helping a small thief to become a bigger one, a dacoit and maybe a murderer or rapist in future, if the small crime is not checked ASAP.<br/><br/>
Until we don't understand the need of resolution of smaller problems, we will keep spending more time in resolving them when they become bigger and darker.
