Headline::::Five Types of Right-Wing Commentary in Contemporary India



DateTime::::2015-09-26T22:51:00+05:30




                                One of the features of the present political moment is the richness of right-wing opinion that animates the columns of our newspapers and websites. After decades of subfusc existence conservative pundits are out in the open in the altogether, tanning themselves in the glow of Narendra Modi's sun lamp. The light has an orange tint, the air smells a little of sulphur, bleating liberals gasp for oxygen, but the big beasts of the right are in good voice.
The Lifers, the older ones who cheered L.K. Advani on in his pink chariot, who watched in awed delight as the Babri Masjid fell, who discerned a silver lining in the killings that followed, an early Hindu dawn, now bask in the warmth of vindication. What was once prejudice is now prescience; Lifers might even get written into history books as heralds of the 'Hindu' turn. There's a new virility to their writing; freed of the euphemisms that cripple politically correct conversation, they can now name the blights that beleaguer Bharat: treachery, sodomy, self-hatred.
The Laterals moved sideways to the right. Roughly the same age as the Lifers, they made the shift later in life so their narratives are necessarily different. Looking left as they crabwalk in the opposite direction, their special talent is the existential voice-over in which they detail the reasons for their conversion. These are various: dynasty and democracy, the regressiveness of caste politics, the menace of Maoists, the insidiousness of Islamists, the need for change, but rhetorically the most powerful justification is Modi's potential to transform the Indian economy. Of all the slides that bear people from the centre to the right in India, the economy supplies the smoothest ride.
It lets the Lateral feel like a doctor in the emergency room, doing triage. What should he save, secularism or the economy? The economy, naturally. The well-being of the poor hinges on it; ergo, people who obsess over secularism are elitists. This is a sophisticated, post-ironical move: the middle-aged economists, CEOs, touts and make-over artists that crowd Lutyens' Dehi have found in the economy a secular reason for rallying round Modi.
The Latelies are a sub-set of the Laterals. They are younger, itinerant and always online. They are thirty-ish Anglophones -- journalists, academics, think-tank seminarists -- who lead (or have led) non-resident lives. They are ambitious professionals who self-identified as conservatives but were hesitant to come out in support of Modi because of the Gujarat pogrom. Embedded in North American institutions, they were constrained by politically correct pieties till a few months before the 2014 elections when they drowned their inhibitions in the building tide of support for Modi. Their timelines bear witness to this pivot; from echoing standard liberal concerns about Modi's connection with the 2002 pogrom in 2013 to cheer-leading his ascension in 2014 is not a shift that is easily explained away.
The Latelies are unfairly accused of opportunism when their motives are more mixed. They support Modi both out of conviction and as a career move. Had Modi lost they would have remained closet majoritarians; now that he's won they can give their inner Hindu an airing. They are rhetorically interesting because their experience of being part of a non-white minority in America has taught them the tropes of victimhood. It allows them, for instance, to virtuously identify with the RSS when that organisation fulminates against Christian missionaries in India; instead of feeling like bullies picking on a tiny Indian minority, they feel like Lilliputians standing up to a global evangelical behemoth.
The Latelies use two ramps to the right. First, the pressing need for business-friendly economic reforms which they share with the Laterals and second, the need for a potent foreign policy which is an issue that's quite their own. The first is an alibi for moving right; the second is the sublimation of the urge to be a muscular Hindu into the diplomacy needed to build a virile state.
This leaves us with two categories, Liberals and Lumpen. It is rare but not unheard of for liberals to make common cause with majoritarians. After the Allahabad High Court judgment on the dispute over the site of the razed Babri Masjid, several liberal voices came out in support of a verdict that rewarded the Hindu parties to the suit with two-thirds of the disputed land. These Liberals offered reasons both nuanced and crude for their endorsement; this not the place to rehearse them. Suffice it to say that this endorsement defined them as irrevocably as the endorsement of the Iraq War defined American liberals seduced by Bush. Through the tenure of a Narendra Modi government the Babri Masjid issue will inevitably be agitated and it will be interesting to see if these Liberals resile from their positions or hold fast to them and make common cause with this regime.
While discussing right-wing commentary in India, the Lumpen need no introduction. Lumpen offerings in the online world are a form of ambient noise rather than argument, but they serve an important rhetorical function. On Twitter, for example, Lumpen constitute the force-multiplying audience that amplifies right-wing arguments offered by Lifers, Laterals, Latelies and, sometimes, Liberals. More importantly, the rage, profanity and bigotry of these trolls is a reminder that stripped of rhetorical flourish, right-wing politics in India amounts to little more than a majoritarian loathing of Muslims and Others.Mukul Kesavan is a writer based in Delhi.

                            Seriously, the Laterals like Surjit, Malik, Dasgupta, all should just come out and just declare their undying love to Modi; and be done with it. <br/><br/>
I don't have any problem with anyone (irrationally) praising Modi at all, but just don't frigging pretend to be neutral and acting on my country's interest. Period.

                            Wrong....the so called liberals and lefties have lost the wind beneath their sails because they were hollow, hypocrites and elitists. True liberals are fair and analytical but our Indian liberals were simply loyalists and completely out of touch. They looked the other way when independent India's history was written in a way that lied to Hindus about their origin, their culture and their plunder. They were silent when the government marginalised entire Muslim women community with their obscene Shah Bano dictat. They were missing in action when Pandits became refugee in their own state. The collective muslim loathing that u accuse Indian right of is actually a left wing thing. Liberals loath Muslims to the point of obstructing any attempt of the community to join the mainstream while empowering the most lumpen and regressive Muslim leadership. Indian people are not stupid Mr. Kesvan. Elitist liberals like you may be outraged that the Indian people have refused to let you think on their behalf. They know what is good for them and they are powerful enough to put the right in their place if they too betray them.

                            What a holier than though leftist verbal diarrhea? So, all these years your ilk could put down right of center people by name calling. Now that there has been a political shift to the right and those voices that could be previously contemptuously dismissed, can't be dismissed anymore, in the changed reality your liberal rootless world has come crashing down. So what do you expect, people cower down to intellectual snobbery and no question you even after your stupid ideology has been rejected by the people of India.

                            Sickular crap. I am a Christian by birth but happy to have a PM who does not play minority vote bank politics. Being from Kerala, I know how much sickular politics has sidelined the majority. Minorities have special rights (running educational institutions the way they want, as an instance) but majority has none. They are expected to accommodate without complaining. If someone asks for uniform civil code, he is dubbed right wing. Someone questions caste based reservation, he becomes right wing. But, nobody questions an Owaisi and it is secular to share power with him. When the Muslim league minister in Kerala reduces the wedding age for muslim girls to 16, is that secular?

                            Brilliant analysis. But the real problem for liberals in this country is not the lateleys/laterals/lifers  and the lumpen crowd.It is the leadership crisis facing liberals in this country today. There are no dearth of brilliant minds and even force-multiplying audience on the liberal side.There is just no leader of the stature and the capability of a Nehru or Indira Gandhi.  The immature leadership of Rahul gandhi is a real let down for the liberals.

I believe he is doing a good job, even though I don't agree with policies like meat bans, ghar wapasi etc. But we need a balance in our country after 10 years of minority appeasing policies.

                            Mr. Kesavan, people hate pseudo secularists and elitists for very good reasons. And your writing is one of them. You want the fire between religions and castes to keep burning. Otherwise you will have no livelihood left. As per your Right-Left, Conservative-Liberal commentary: You are stupid if you think that Indian political parties are divided on these lines. And that again shows how you elitists forcefully want to project India on Western divisions and hence, how stupid you "elitists" actually are.

                            Leftist Diarrhea . These socialist/leftists thoughts always had over-representation and had a certain cool &amp; elitism. Now the landscape is changing and they are getting bracketed with old, dilapidated losers mentality. These are some last minute rants &amp; wriggles before they are shown their place in the new India which is practical, real and believes in the spirit of middle-class rather than leadership from the elite social thinkers.

                            Also, Mukul: In democracies, its tempting to attribute your losses to the 'propaganda-addled' minds of the masses. More likely, you're losing because your ideas and opinions are not speaking to most peoples' experiences and concerns.<br/><br/>
What is happening is mere course correction of sorts; certain pressing issues that were deliberately ignored under UPA rule will be taken up and resolved. Land reforms for industrialization; a better tax regime; better governance and execution; more transparency in business and trade policy; more energy and engagement in foreign policy - all these signature Modi moves seem to suit the current mood. Other issues like the Uniform Civil Code, restitution of Kashmiri Pandit populations, regulating 'faith-healing' conversions, etc may seem like 'Hindu' concerns, but they are consistent with Constitution values and the expectation of good men.<br/><br/>
Someday, the centre-left will present a viable governing alternative, and return to power. But the days of an entitled leftist monopoly on all things Indian are thankfully behind us.

                            Mukul, your piece begins well. I think its useful to consider where the energy for the emergent right comes from, and to make distinctions between their many kinds. But the temptation to psychoanalyze those who disagree with us is a peevish instinct, it takes away from the seriousness of our discourse.<br/><br/>
Over the last sixty years, our debate on constitutional matters, economic policy, religion and national identity has moved so far left of what our founding fathers intended. To wit: Swami Vivekanand, Madan Mohan Malviya, Dr. Rajendra Prasad and others were not apologetic of their Hindu roots. Dr Radhakrishnan wrote at length about western misappropriation of Hindu scripture and history. Gandhi spoke of the destabilizing nature of missionary conversions. Ambedkar, in his book on Partition, wrote of the problems of an unreformed Muslim population. Sardar Patel advocated a robust policy on national security issues. C Rajagopalachari protested that Nehru's Soviet experiment would handicap India's enthusiasm for entrepreneurship and private enterprise. <br/><br/>
Are we to believe that these great men were, in retrospect, mere rhetorical mouthpieces for an ugly 'majoritarian' agenda?

                            Whilst he might think he finds many types of right wingers, the monolithic, pseudo-secular, leftist-"liberal" hangers-on are united in their worship at the feet of the dynasty and genuflection at some demented logic that anything and everything, which is in minority, must be right and be supported even if it is murderous, intolerant and extremely backward-looking and a road block to development.

The type that will equate Taliban and ISIS who kill people, really large number oif people, thousands of people in ugly way and make sex slaves out of their mothers and sisters and daughters just because they don't share the same faith with RSS. You are here may be to sell your next book, or make yourselves famous in the 'opinion maker' space, writing whatever you can because you have a way with words, without worrying what kind of poison that it will plant in the minds of the gullible reader, all for earning that epithet of a neutral figure.

                            Even when this Government does the same things as the last Government, the Government gets attacked. For example meat ban in Bombay was in vogue by NCP and Congress. The same thing by BJP Government gets attacked with ferocity. The attacks on Churches or rationalists happens in Congress Government as well, but only BJP Government gets attacked. This has happened repeatedly.

                            I am Human first. Neither a leftist or rightist. I want good life equally for all humans. For me there is no difference between Hindu and Muslim or Jew and Muslim or Sikh and Hindu or Indian and Pakistani or Sunni and Shia or White and Black or any other famed pro and anti.<br/>
For me those who want to live happily and let others live happily on thier terms ate good people.<br/>
Even the primitive animal instinct is to support or ghettoize with their own kind, while hating the "others". But as we want to call ourself humans, then we have to show developed minds, which treat others in same way as our types.<br/>
The motivation to spread hate for the others is either primitive or biased or delibrate due to hidden agendas.<br/>
I "REFUSE" to be any of these three. I don't even know if I'm the only one who think like this. I really don't care. As I know that weak stand hiding behind the mobs and strong stand alone, even against wave of public opinions.

                            You can do any analysis and categorise people any way you want. It may not necessarily be true. Always a difficult job to try and get into somebody else's mind and ascertain their motives. What is correct is that nationalism seems to be on the upswing as seen in the BJP victory. As India gets out of the morass of the last 60 years, the people also seem to be pretty confident of themselves, and economically and socially more advanced. That itself is a great achievement in a diverse country.

Having said that another extremist behaviour on the name of secularism and intellectual claim is to undermine anything that is Indian and using freedom of speech to portray Indian culture in bad way should be unacceptable as well.

                            These pseudo liberals sucked the blood of nations for 70 years and primarily responsible for the current mess in India.These elitist thugs looted the nation by intellectually, morally, ethically, economically and spritually. Since these frauds have a global network they can amplify their lies. But now the world is waking up to their lies thats why this branding and name calling to alternate point of view.

                            Mukul Kesavan, this statement is so inaccurate! "After decades of subfusc existence conservative pundits are out in the open in the altogether, tanning themselves in the glow of Narendra Modi's sun lamp. "<br/>
You and your fellow retards have been warming yourselves in the warmth of the Congress and Commies, that now you are off scampering into the woodwork where you think you would be safe. You guys are cold blooded creatures that cannot move when the sun is not shining on you are you are not being greased with Western money for fake human rights and sundry studies!

                            My humble request to the Indian Left (I feel sincerely because I come from a right-wing family with now left-wing European education) please do not demean right-wing as some idiot plankton with no gray cells while you have monopoly over intellect. Please try to look into your own guilts of the past, especially of re-writing the history. Eg? Well within days of independent India, R.C. Majumdar's book left a bad taste in the mouth of Nehru. Result? Banned!! And die-hard Nehru bhakts like Vipin Chandra were promoted. Anyone who thinks RC Majumdar is an inferior historian, has my sympathies for his limited cranial capacity. Ask any unbiased non-Indian who has read about modern day India, and he will tell you that Left in India has been anything but liberal and accommodating. The sooner you see the defect, the sooner you would start remedying it.

                            I have never seen such a coagulation of hooey in article. What you sipped , while writing this nonsense, is of bigger interest than your output here. The fact is , you have not been able to handle the fact that the left has been decimated 10 years ago, with no signs of being resuscitated.Folks like you tried mouth-to-mouth breathing during the last LS elections to revive them, but it didn't work.<br/><br/>
It is about time, you get real and stick you head out of the sands.Sunlight does hurt when you come out of the cave!

                            Certain sections of media and also NGO's couldn't digest the fact that BJP won 282 seats and central govt with absolute majority has become eyesore for them. These anti-development groups had heydays with cocktail parties and adequate funds during UPA regime. They want BJP to be limited to 150-160 seats party. They tried hard before LS2014 but failed and instead it boomeranged

                            @: True. Only self-certified intellectuals from liberal left (semantics in Indian context: those who have no liberalism left in them), have the right to be proclaimed neutral. When they write history text-books deifying Nehru, it should be called true history; any one pointing to the mistakes done by Nehru or atrocities of Aurangzeb should be called Sanghi or Chhadi and should be treated worse than Fuehrer did to the Jews! Awesome!!

                            @Anonymous: I am a Hindu and not at all happy to have Modi as PM. Feeling bad  for having voted for him. Development is very important no secind thought, but he is destroying the very fabric of nation. Muslims are made to look like enemies and terrorists. When Christian population has actually reduced  about 1.3 % from being 4.5% to 3%, where is mass conversion happening? Show the facts right! This Modi is dividing India or in other words, RSS using Modi to divide India. Educations institutions cannot be run the way anyone wants. there are rules and regulations. Whether one likes or not, today's 80% of educated people are from Christian institutions where discipline was imparted as a foremost important thing. Dont distort facts like RSS!!!!

                            The write-up presents a piece of great literary achievement. I could not get into the depth of his write-up. Of late there are many write-ups from individuals, either too pro or too anti to the lines of action of the Indian PM. I think we should get out of the too pro or too anti type of mindset, and we should become too pro to the facts in the field. PM has his own lines of dreams for the country who has given him the opportunity to excel. But that should not be taken as an item to express literary excellence.
