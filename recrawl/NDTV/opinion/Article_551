Headline::::Jailing Juveniles for the BJP's Joy



DateTime::::2015-05-08T14:03:00+05:30




                                The Lok Sabha - which is to say, the brute majority of the BJP in the lower house - passed on Thursday the Juvenile Justice Bill, which should more appropriately have been called the Juvenile Injustice Bill. By changing the law to ensure that 16 to 18 years olds can now be tried, convicted and sentenced as adults to twenty years in prison for "heinous offences", it has regressively plunged our nation into the darkness of 19th century jurisprudence.
The proposal will put in place a selective system, whereby the Juvenile Justice Board will have discretionary powers to transfer a child in the age group of 16-18 years, accused of rape, murder, kidnapping, robbery, dacoity, and other offences which are punishable with imprisonment for a minimum term of seven years, to an adult criminal justice system for trial and conviction. An excuse for this barbarism is not hard to find. It is a reaction to the horrific Nirbhaya case of 2012, which shocked the national conscience, especially when it was learned from the media that the most heinous acts in that criminal episode were allegedly the doings of a juvenile. When the media suggested that it was likely he would get away with minimum punishment, and that the system might leave a predator free on the streets, there was understandable uproar in all quarters. Someone close to me, naturally agitated and emotional, said: 'If he is old enough to rape, he is old enough to hang.'
The problem with such an approach is twofold. It treats children as adults, which is wrong morally, legally, ethically, emotionally, and constitutionally. A 16-year-old may be physically a man but does not have the mental maturity of an adult. During the immediate aftermath of the Nirbhaya tragedy, the UPA undertook extensive consultations in 2013, which confirmed that the arguments for punitive action were based on fear, moral outrage, misinformation, and ignorance. This is why we did not give in to popular demand for such a change. And secondly, entire laws, which apply to the cases of all juveniles across the board, cannot and should not be determined on the basis of one bad example, no matter how horrifying or terrible it might be. Laws should be studied instruments of justice; they cannot be based on a specific instance alone, and it is the duty of the government of the day to ask itself whether good law and good justice can ever be born out of an impulsive reaction to emotional headlines.
This Bill defies all logic. International examples show that transferring children to the adult system has failed to prevent repeat offences, failed to reduce the juvenile crime rate and failed to promote public safety. In fact, it will increase the risk to public safety because convicting a child in an adult criminal trial will not just deny the child the fulfilment of his basic rights and his physical, emotional and intellectual development - twenty years in jail will eventually churn out hardened criminals rather than reformed adults, defeating its declared purpose. A US study has established that 80% of the juveniles released from adult prisons go on to commit more serious offences. Sojailing more children will be neither in the best interests of the child nor of society as a whole.
Of the 472 million children in our country, only 1.2 % actually committed crimes in 2013. The number of children who committed "serious and heinous crimes" was miniscule. In 2013, of all the children apprehended for crimes under the Indian Penal Code, 2.17% were accused of murder and 3.5% were accused of rape. That is 2.1% of 1.2% -- a tiny figure for whose crimes we are turning our system of justice upside down. These figures of the National Crime Records Bureau account for the FIRs registered and not the children who were actually found guilty. They do not justify this stringent and completely retrograde step.
Worse, this provision will predominantly affect the country's poor and marginalised sections of our society -- OBCs, SCs, STs and minorities. A majority of the children in conflict with law come from illiterate families and poor homes. Statistically, in 2013, 77.55% of the arrested children came from families with a monthly household income less than INR 4,200, and 87% of the offenders had not even received a higher secondary education. Such socio-economic conditions only reiterate the urgency to develop better reformative facilities for educating and reintegrating children with criminal tendencies into mainstream society, rather than subjecting them to a harsh justice system and twenty years' jail, especially when such children lack adequate legal representation. This would never succeed as a deterrent: it will simply make them unfit for normal life after they are freed. The government could have raised the punishment for heinous crimes by kids from three to a maximum of seven years rather than taking the extreme step of considering a child no longer to be a child.
It is really the Government's job to implement the existing provisions for rehabilitating children in conflict with law. It cannot shrug off its responsibility by holding the children accountable for failures of the juvenile rehabilitative system of our country. The Government should fix the Juvenile Justice system, not by pass it and victimise our children. Instead, it is trying to brush the real issue under the carpet, to put behind bars the problem we face. Political convenience for the BJP has trumped justice for India's children.
In Parliament, I spelled out in great detail why the Bill not only lacked a rational social objective but also constitutional validity. The selective and unequal treatment of children between the age group of 16-18 years clearly violates the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 14 and Article 15 (3) of the Constitution. While Article 14 extends equal protection of law and equality before the law, Article 15(3) allows the state to enact special provisions for protecting children, for they are vulnerable and require special care and protection. The existing juvenile system recognises that 16-18 years is a sensitive age which requires greater emphasis on reformation and rehabilitation than on punishment. The new Bill goes in the opposite direction.
The Bill also creates a trial before the trial by giving the Juvenile Justice Board one month for a preliminary assessment of whether the child should be tried as an adult - a period so short that it could lead to a presumption of guilt, which itself violates the Constitution. As the Justice Verma Committee observed in 2013 while rejected the case for a draconian new law, "We cannot hold the child responsible for a crime before first providing him/her the basic rights given to him by the court."
Ironically we can't even be sure the child we're trying really is the age he appears to be. Our courts rely on the Matriculation Certificate of a child or his Birth Certificate from a School or a Municipal Corporation. However, many government and municipal schools often record age on the basis of the physical appearance of a child, and in many cases parents give an earlier age just to get the child into school (ask Gen. V.K. Singh!)The children who would be immediately affected by this legislation were born at a time when the level of birth registration was just 58% (in 2001). Since the estimated age can have drastic repercussions on the life of a child, the presumption should in fact be that the child is younger than the date mentioned in his school certificate. The law makes no allowances for this Indian reality.
This government may not be embarrassed to shame us before the world, but the Bill violates India's undertakings under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989, the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice 1985 or the Beijing Rules, and the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty 1990 -- all of which require a child or a young person, accused of an offence, to be treated differently from an adult. This Bill is an equal-opportunity offender: it violates every principle it can possibly violate. Condemnation by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child will certainly follow.
OK, forget the UN; what about India? There are no special provisions or guidelines for either a female juvenile in conflict with law or a juvenile sex offender. Misuse is likely: if children are found indulging in consensual sex, it is possible that the male can be charged with rape and sent to the adult crime system.
Even though the Juvenile Justice Bill could bring about some much needed reforms in adoption and foster care, it disappoints in its inability to justly treat children in conflict with law. An important principle of jurisprudence that all law students learn is 'Lex iniustanon est lex': 'an unjust law is no law at all'. This Bill is unlikely to withstand the scrutiny of the Courts, that is if it passes the Rajya Sabha at all.
The need of the hour is not this Bill. It is to focus our attention on the effective implementation of the existing Juvenile Justice legislation. In our country, child protection under the law has been marred by insufficient investments, lack of adequate number of Juvenile Justice Boards (JJB) and Child Welfare Committees (CWC), lack of institutional services such as Shelter Homes, Special Homes, and Observation Homes, and the absence of an effective monitoring and coordinating mechanism. Can the Minister argue that our country possesses adequate administrative and judicial provisions to operationalize the Bill? Will the Finance Minister give her the resources she needs or do again to her request what was done to the anganwadis - cut them to the point of unviability?
I doubt it. This government has shirked its responsibilities to finance such essential work. Budgetary allocations for the development of children have faced drastic cuts, with a reduction of 55% in allocations. In fact, the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS), the primary scheme for creating a safe environment for children in need of care and protection, has been allocated just INR 400 crores, almost 11% less than its revised estimate for last year. Child Welfare Officers have not been appointed in Police Stations across the country. Even though the Bill now provides for a National Commission for Protection of Child Rights and a State Commission for Protection of Child Rights for monitoring the implementation of the provisions of the Bill, they could become as redundant as the existing institutions, especially if this government starves them financially.
The Juvenile Justice Bill, despite a few positive provisions, makes one cardinal error: it forgets that our justice should be about rehabilitation, not retribution. We must not sacrifice our values and our children for political gain. That is what the BJP has done, and the nation must rise against it.

                            This is all about the perception of injustice where in the case of Nirbhaya, the guy who did the most damage was let off with minimal punishment. He should have been tried as an Adult. Stop trying to be the Congress loyalist. You could be better than that.

                            So, when he is 17 years 364 days of age he is immature. And on the next day, BOOM, he is mature. Great logic Mr. Tarur. Let me tell you why we are emotional and agitated. It is because of the fact that my daughter or my sister or my mother or my wife cannot walk the streets of india without having the fear of being raped, thanks to the corrupt governments and flawed rules in the country.

                            It is strange that a progressive person as you says this. Time has change and children are coming of age much more faster than say 20-30 or even 10 years ago, and this  you must realize. The maturity and thinking of a 16 year today is that of a 20/21 year from the earlier times. They have also become more aware and  responsible for their actions and dont like to be look upon as juveniles.<br/>
The bill passed has decided to be selective to those between 16-18, to be decided by a respectable forum.The two cases of extreme brutality that is rarely seen in juveniles but often in adults in recent times have made all of us think about this and we the people have pushed our view on to the Government who thankfully have taken cognizance of the larger majority view, which sadly you and your you party seem to have lost focus of, if you permit me to say that.Do hope you alingn yourself to the new emerging India.

"effective implementation of the existing Juvenile Justice legislation", insufficient investments, lack of adequate number of Juvenile Justice Boards (JJB) and Child Welfare Committees (CWC), lack of institutional services such as Shelter Homes, Special Homes, and Observation Homes, and the absence of an effective monitoring and coordinating mechanism", who the hell is responsible for all this?

                            By your argument, if we increased the accepted age of adulthood to 21, then an 18 year old should not be tried as an adult, but as a Juvenile. It's absurd! Also, in case you haven't noticed, people are maturing earlier these days, they're experiencing everything earlier than when your generation did. Thus, is it not perfectly reasonable to treat children as adults for heinous crimes only?<br/><br/>
You're just peeved that the BJP pushed this through. Grow up.

                            In the case of Nirbhaya, neither the 16 yr old one nor the ones above 18, 25 or 30 showed any mercy to that poor soul. Now rapists are getting more violent and destroying evidence, which is the raped person itself, to avoid getting caught. In such cases a 3 year jail term is like a lullaby for these criminals. Only such harsh or even harsher punishment will serve as a "Deterrent"

                            Is Mr. Shashi Tharoor saying that on 17yrs and 364th day one is immature and on 18th year he becomes mature and is fully aware of all his actions. Agree that purpose of any criminal law should be rehabilitation and not retribution. But if the such a heinous action is committed judicial system should have a way of making an example of the case to the society in such a way that, one is reminded of the consequences before the criminal act is carried out. The problem in India is the implementation of law is so lax (thanks to 60+ years of Congress rule) that no one cares for law, as the time taken to punish a criminal is very long and also if you have enough money, you can delay the justice at will and if you are a day younger than 18, you can get away with a murder. So the message that was being sent out is commit all kind of crimes before 18 and India will not question you. <br/>
And in India you can not build a preventive system and the political / liberals will question that also. Can you introduce a curriculum which highlights and makes it abundantly clear that if you make a mistake, you will be severely punished? Liberal gang will be up against any disciplining.

                            Let us invert your argument. You say that a 'miniscule' portion of children commit crimes. So, is it not the duty of the state to ensure that this number remains small by striking fear of punishment among criminals? Did you take a minute to study the proportion of people in age bracket 16-18 (in this minuscule portion of child criminals) who have committed heinous crimes? You give some reference from some US study. Did you pause to think that the US does not have a blanket age rule and treats child criminals as adults, depending on the severity of their crime?<br/><br/>
You claim these 'kids' are orphan. Well, a large number, in fact a majority, of orphans, of disadvantaged do not commit crimes. Should they, because the society is so unjust?<br/><br/>
Shame on you, Tharoor. Shame

                            Mr. Tharoor, first and foremost i presume you have read the legislation you are criticizing....the exception applies specifically for heinous crimes!!!!! Your argument that the mental makeup of a 16yr old is not mature enough to know what he is doing is ludicrous to say the least!!! A person who indulges in a heinous and gruesome act against another human being is essentially acting like an animal and not a human being....never mind their age!!! For once in your life, rise above your myopic and petty party affiliation and think from the victim's perspective!!! Seems to me that you think that victims have no human rights, whiles the perpetrators do!!! Since when has the purpose of drafting laws been to solely safeguard rights of those who perpetuate crimes?? Would you still have the same opinion if a 16yr old had done something heinous against your family....be truthful to your conscience when you answer that!!!!

                            Tharoor has, as usual tried to impress with statistics.   After all, his research assistant has to pay his/her way!  That said, it is now obvious that the degree Tharoor obtained was in 'stating the obvious'.  All of us know that 'children' who commit crime are from poor and uneducated backgrounds.  Well, so are adults! So, would that mean that anybody from a poor and uneducated background committing a crime be exempted from punishment?  Does he not realise that most victims are also from the same class?  As for his insinuation that a 'juvenile'  may be physically developed but incapable of understanding his actions as his mind is that of a child, believe me, the prospect of a noose around the neck will soon cause that 'juvenile' to have a deep understanding of his actions.  The 'juvenile' in the Nirbhaya case was capable of plotting his escape, blending into a community as a jobbing worker is a brick factory and also being as far away from the scene of crime as possible.  He should have been hanged!  Tharoor is a bleeding heart do-gooder who has probably never met a poor juvenile in his life.  He has also probably never met a victim in his life.  After all, they are all 'cattle class' people who do not live and die in 7 star hotels and certainly who do not have 50 crore or indeed priceless girlfriends.  India can do with less understanding and more punishment.

                            India is a developing country. We do not have a robust justice system. State of juvenile justice is far worse. Probably juveniles get better treatment in jails than what they suffer in Juvenile rehabilitation centers.<br/>
Do not question the public sentiment. It is always better than the knowledge of intellectual. Only when an intellectual is able to communicate public perception changes. In this case intellectuals are communication some nonsense of ideal world. What is the cost of rehabilitating a criminal? From where this money comes from? Does this happen at the expense of innocent who could have benefited from this money.<br/>
If you apply this analysis then many will start supporting capital punishment for smaller crimes. As for the rapists you can castrate them and leave them back. This is a just punishment for the crime.

                            Mr. Tharoor, your numbers do not depict the right picture. when you say only 1.2% children committed crime out of 475 million children, can you give the numbers from the children in age group of 16-18. And I am sure these numbers will go up very high.<br/>
As far as rights of these children are concerned, they must be preserved but just like the rights of any criminals. why should it be different. Third, what this law does is that try to plug the loopholes. We have seen numerous cases where the accused has been let off or treated as a juvenile just because he is days away from becoming a Adult. Wouldn't that make him a hard core criminal given the fact the he got away with what he did!!!

                            Why do you feel that this will regressively plunge our nation into the darkness of 19th century jurisprudence? Many enlightened countries have similar laws. It is well known that as generations go by, maturity, both physical and mental, is accelerating. Not just diet, but the Internet age is helping in this. It's not uncommon for girls to attain puberty before they reach 10, and boys are far more enlightened today than two generations ago. If the age of consent has progressively reduced, then why can't age of conviction for terrible crimes be reduced as well.

                            If you wee the victim of a barbaric juvenile, your views may not be quite the same. All bleeding heart liberals are alike. What about the victim's rights? The purpose of any criminal justice system has to be to protect society and the individual from the criminal. Harsh sentences act as a deterrent. Reformation of the criminal is a secondary consideration. Never the primary consideration. If you are old enough to rape and kill, then you are old enough to be prosecuted for it. This should be widely disseminated. And taught in schools.

                            Mr. Tharoor, we agree that children need to be treated as children. Do we have any statistics that shows the Juveniles between the age group of 16-18 who were given an opportunity to fix their life after heinous crimes actually reformed and came to the main stream of the society? My gut is that, apart from the ones that committed these crimes due to the situation/spur of the moment, others just take this as cooling period and come out of the system and jump to big leagues. At the age of 15+ they mostly understand the difference between right and wrong. If left unpunished, these same individuals get out of the Juvenile correctional facilities and become part of the underworld. Hence, it is Just and good from the health of the society perspective to treat these 16-18 year old as Adults when it comes to heinous crimes.

Maybe you can take these criminals under you &amp; protect them to safety at your house/bunglaws as these are just miniscule which can be handled by you!!<br/>
Please DONT BRING IN RELIGION OR CASTE HERE.<br/>
for the reduction in crimes in INDIA, we must have stricter laws, very strict laws inline with Singapore, or gulf countries &amp; We the people must change. I cant complain the Govt for all the crimes.... We should change, People must fear doing crimes &amp; that can happen only with stricter laws &amp; enforcing them irrespective of caste, religion &amp; specially Economic Criteria.. The Rich must be equally punished if proven guilty &amp; Justice must be fast---super fast... Hope some day peace prevails..

                            There is no dispute that the juveniles need to be treated differently than adult criminals. The disagreement is on the age limit for being considered as a juvenile. One way or the other, it is just an artificial construct. It is alright to place such artificial cutoff number for passing marks or voting rights or driving license. Here such an artificial construct is going to ruin somebody's life or going to let a demon scot free...<br/>
472 million children in 2013. For the sake of argument I'm dividing them equally in each year bracket, though number would be much more in age 0-1 than in age 17-18. <br/>
Of that you say only 1.2% committed crime, in actual numbers it becomes 56.64 lac which is quite a lot! And in fact 1.2 percent in itself is not a small proportion. This would be a huge percentage even for grown-up population (0.54% of the WHOLE population committed crimes in 2013. This includes special and local laws as well and not just IPC for which the percentage is 0.22%). You must be making some mistake in mentioning facts. Because it would mean, on an average 12 children in a school of 1000 students are accused of crime! Or, in other words, one child in every 40 households is a juvenile delinquent!!<br/>
Now let's consider that children up to age 7 have blanket immunity. They cannot be thought of committing any crime. Neither any authority would be foolish enough to take cognisance even if they commit any. So about 184 million children out of these 472 are not in consideration for our statistics. So we are talking about 288 million children. The figure of 1.2% becomes almost 2%!<br/>
Which means every one child in a high school class of 50 students is charged with some sort of crime!! And we are not talking about overall figure till date, but for one year alone!!!<br/>
You say ONLY 2.17% and 3.5% of those 56.64 lac juvenile delinquents are accused of murder and rape respectively. That in actual terms is 1.23 lac and 1.98 lac respectively ONLY!<br/>
Next; it is difficult for me to imagine any child younger than 15 years old committing a murder. But let's for sake of argument consider the cutoff age for murder as 10, above which there would be around 210 million children. So one out of every 1700 children between age group 10-18 has committed murder in 2013!<br/>
And you too would not believe that a child below age of 13 would commit rape technically (generally it would not be before the age of 15-16, but just for argument sake, 13 years). In age band of 14-18 years we have 131 million children. Of that, considering very poor sex ratio in India, about 70 million are male children. Of them 1.98 lac are, according to you, accused of rape, which is 1 male child out of every 350 in high-school age band is on an average accused of rape in 2013!!<br/>
I mean where do you do your homework or practice of Maths? Just to show how few children commit crime you actually end up putting such an unbelievable figure, that it turns your own argument upside down. <br/>
The so called 'minuscule' figures you are quoting are too detached from reality. I don't agree with your viewpoint about age limit of juvenile. And I also don't agree with almost all the comments that are made against your argument in 'comments' section. As per my thinking the solution is much different that what you or your opponents think. But more about that later. <br/>
The purpose is to tell you that such simple arguments are not expected from a person like you. Put some strong defence for your argument or just don't argue. <br/>
I believe that the number of juvenile delinquents is much smaller that what you call minuscule. Even then I don't buy your theory Mr Tharoor. <br/>

                            I totally support Mr. Tharoor on this issue... A rationale person can only think like that... The root cause of crime in India is poverty, lack of education and opportunities and adolescent behaviour which is more about risk taking, experimentation and peer and other influences... As a society we need to decide if an adolescent is committing a crime what solution we have... Putting him in jail will make him a better person and will make the society safe or providing him opportunities to reform by giving him a chance... We all need to discuss that... In my opinion putting a teenager with adult criminals will not neither help the society nor the adolescent... It is lose-lose situation for all..

                            There is a tendency among some intellectuals to show that their thinkings are something of a "Class " and not in line with normal people of this land.. With their vocabulary or empty verbiage or ornamental writings ( mostly written in the comforts of Star Hotels with sips from costly bottles sometime in the laps of entertainers as per their tastes...) many of the so called " Class intellectuals" like Taroor refuse to recognize ordinary citizens worries about a corrupt , non considerate system of administration ,police and even judiciary .. Even an attempt by the present government to think in terms of an ordinary citizen or give some hints of assurance about the safety of women through an amendment to an Act is desisted by characters like Taroor... We can only pity him for his dishonesty of thought and his attempt to write on some thing siting in an ivory tower of comforts and luxury without any touch of the harsh realities of life ...Let him also introspect honestly was he all the time doing right for this nation or even to his family ... Surely the reply will be negative and let him come out with big suggestions on the amendment when he is sure he is keeping himself honest on the above points

                            Certain crime automatically identify adulthood! A rape is a rape, the culprit by 'nature' is an adult, hence able to perform the sexual crime.  So, whether he is 12, 14, 16 or 18, I do not care.  He should be punishable for the max sentence under the adult law, since he performed an adult act of sex and the crime.  As someone said, you cannot let the culprit go free, just because he is 15yrs and 364 days old. If he committed rape, age has no mining!  Time to put this matter in right perspective.  As for other crimes, there should not be any cut off age limit, but perhaps a gradual age factor applied. For homicide, 18 yes jail term, if you are 18 and above. 17 yrs jail term if you are 17 yrs old, 16 yrs. jail term if you are 16 and yes, 15yrs. jail term, if you are 15 and so on.

                            In USA in the 1990s, Schools and politicians adopted zero tolerance policies with regard to crime, and argued that rehabilitative approaches were less effective than strict punishment.The increased ease in trying juveniles as adults became a defining feature of "tough-on-crime" policies in the 1990s. "[o]ne way in which "get tough" advocates have supported a merger between the adult criminal and juvenile systems is by expanding the scope of transfer provisions or waivers that bring children under the jurisdiction of the adult criminal system". Some states moved specific classes of crimes from the juvenile court to adult criminal court while others gave this power to judges or prosecutors on a case-by-case basis. Still others require the courts to treat offending youth like adults, but within the juvenile system. In some states, adjudicated offenders face mandatory sentences. By 1997, all but three states had passed a combination of laws that eased use of transfer provisions, provided courts with expanded sentencing options and removed the confidentiality tradition of the juvenile court.<br/><br/>
Tharoor also is writing off the hip without any background study. NDTV is also encouraging very poor writers like shobha de etc to write.

                            Shashi Tharoor is Absolute Nuts. His only Agenda is to support the Moron and his Party. Being a "so called " educated person, I do not understand his views on public policy and peoples welfare. He is directly approving for letting go Rapists, arsonists or all other criminals that follow if they are juveniles. While India is reeling under crimes in cities with all these bad elements of society, his agenda is very selfish and has no value. It is shameful to think that he is from Kerala where it is a Political lab and people have been fighting for ages to get value from their government for the welfare of the people. Shashi you are not fit for Kerala. Go and run for a seat in Amethi.

But dear friend people have now realised that there is no child or grown up that commits a henious crime  without not knowing what he is doing is not just wrong but inhuman, so even if it is a child below 16 that does a inhuman crime he shall be punished, now if a law says so what's wrong about it, I think the judiciary is smart enough to know who is exploiting the law and who is not.

                            Agree completely. Women have votes, children do not. It is a simple as that. The whole nirbhaya case is a disaster. First the law was changed with 6 months in the heat of the nirbhaya rape case. Changing the law now for the juvenile is very disturbing. Somehow people feel that increasing punishment will reduce crime, whereas the evidence is to the contrary - that more severe punishment lead to violent crimes. Instead of bringing crimes to trail, the trend is to change the law almost in every instance.

                            It is pure politics. Women have votes children do have. It is sad that the law is being changed because of one incident. Today children have many more options to go astray. Everyone deserves a second chance, and children much more. What is the logic to reduce from 18 to 16, why not to 14 or 12. Increasing punishment is no answer. America has very harsh laws, but also very high crime rates. India has got into a trap, media hypes a case, focus shifts, instead of enforcing the law, the law itself is changed, for one crime, in the heat of the moment. Nirbhaya case was a sad one, but why is any suggestions that women have to be more careful is considered sexist rather than pure commonsense.

                            Mr.Tharoor's argument is only to get publicity, there is nothing analytical in it in terms of the behavioural changes that has happened in the Indian context and  to the otherwise ill advised and  non counselled juveniles of this country.  How will Mr. Tharoor, in all his philosophical and academic wisdom would feel if somebody puts an Iron rod into the body of him or his close relatives??

                            Mr.Tharoor, your arguments are okay only on paper. The basic premise of considering a 17 year old as a child or 18 year old as an adult regardless of the crime is wrong. You argue that poor people and those from SC/ ST will be affected most. SO? Does it matter? Do you have data on how many juveniles deliberately commit crimes because they fully know that they will not go to jail more than 3 years?<br/><br/>
The bill tries to address this problem.

                            for the first time I do not agree with u sir.. u urself saying the heinous crime committed by juveniles is a minute percentage, still all the children will have their right, atleast this law will take away the priviledge of commiting awful crimes... I guess its the fix in the juvenile law...without compromising all children... if you are worried abt the image in front of the world then u might see this will be replicated in other countries as every country is suffering and looking to changing their law to include heineous crime category

                            I respect the author for his views on politics, social system and historical events. But this is one article which agitated me to my very nerve. When we are drawing a age limit of 18 years, we are arbitrarily drawing a line between somebody who is considered to mentally mature or not mature. So, if a 17 years, 11 months and 29 days old boys commits a crime of rape and murder, he is considered to be mentally immature. And 2 days later such crime is seen as by a adult. How is this correct. I would say, BJP had taken a bold step in correcting this anomaly in the law. Hats off to them.

                            Juveniles are at the most violent at this age.. They are unable to fathom the gravity of their actions. For instance the Colombian drug lords hit men were mostly juveniles as they carried out their orders without any remorse.. Passing a bill without giving into understanding the psychological aspects of the youngsters , will only do more harm than good. Parliament passing bills without a study and guidance from psychologists and sociologists is grossly incorrect.

                            Tharoor may be an advocate of amnesty to the offender, as he aspires to be UN Secretary General inspite of his dubious life style. He advocates that Juvinial rape is innocent and not an offence to call for punishment.But, the brutality of offence has no meaning for him.<br/><br/>
The Law enacted by parliament is balanced one where the juvinial justice board will decide whether the offence qualifies to be treated as juvinyle offence or adult-criminal act.<br/><br/>
There is, of course, a need to strengthen Moral education for the children &amp; all governments should concentrate on this aspect of human development.

                            Mr. Tharoor, I don't usually agree with you, but in this case, you have a good point. Framing a law based on 1 case is quite nonsensical. Well written.

                            Crime on children thats what happens with an incompetent minister like Maneka Gandhi. Modis cabinet is filled with this kind of misfits.People who cry so much for Nirbhaya dont give a damn about the 1000's massacred in Godhra else they would not have voted Modi to power.such is the level of hypocrisy of the Modi bhakts.The adults who were involved in the Nirbhaya case should be jailed not the child below 18 who was not mentally matured to know the consequences of his actions.

You are right, its about BJP's joy ... not to mention the joy of a 16 year old who was involved in a heinous crime ... 20,000 rapes by juveniles (2013) is a minuscule number that should not warrant any change in law ... well electing you to the Indian Parliament certainly made India less safe and not electing you as UN Secretary General has made the world a better place!!

                            Tharoor bats so much to protect heinous crimes of juvenile's but doesn't have ONE word for the victims of these 'kids'. <br/><br/>
A person who can committ a crime like rape or murder cannot be a child. you can't seriously think that he committed a rape because he is a child! I am a middle aged adult and no matter what the provocation I cannot even think of raping somoeone. Bottom line is if you can commit a crime of an adult, be prepared to be treated as an adult.<br/><br/>
As for the existing law, it has been in existance for decades, and as per chamcha Tharoor, no law brought by congress or Gandhi's can have any flaws so how much has juvenile crime reduced since this law was brought in? It's clear the current law is not working and I don't see anything wrong in changing something that isn't working anymore.

                            Why do you say it has regressively plunged our nation into the darkness of 19th century jurisprudence. Several enlightened countries have similar laws. It is a fact that the young is maturing faster today than before, and they know more than what was the case two generations ago. Today more girls reach puberty by 10, and boys are maturing faster than ever before. This is a combination of both diet and access to information through the Internet. If we can lower the age of consent, lower the voting age, then why can't we lower the age of criminal prosecution for he heinous crimes as well?

                            This is as stupid an argument as possible. He is saying after jail term they come out hardened criminal. That applies to 18 year olds and above also . By logic no body should be punished . How can give someone assurance that ( if he is minor) he can get away with a light sentence even if he takes away somebody's life . I have lost all respect for Mr Tharoor.

                            so if a 16 year old rapes you should consider him as a juvenile rape. you mean his rape cannot bring out an offspring.<br/>
look at the type of movies coming out of Bollywood, and the provocative advertisements that are displayed.<br/>
I am sure the same juvenile is not thinking of the rape victim at the time of the act. he is imagining the poster girl.<br/>
this can happen to the husband of the most horny wife in the world too.<br/>
stop your non sense let them be tried in adult courts.<br/>
this passage of the law has set a fear among juveniles. Beware the law is watching you. Think it will bring down such incidents. lets pray it works.<br/>
he is western educated. always quotes western countries as examples, as if india cannot formulate its own laws.
