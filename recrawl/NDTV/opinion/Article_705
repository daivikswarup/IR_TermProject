Headline::::When Rain Creates Hell, Take Chief Ministers to Court



DateTime::::2015-07-13T18:41:00+05:30




                                In India, it rains every year. It is not an unpredictable miracle, nor is the fact that if it rains, water will accumulate, and it will need to be drained out. There is no rocket science here. We have some fine organisations, which, for a lack of better phrasing, are called municipal bodies. Municipal tasks are their focus but they are more adept at accepting bribes than any form of planning or civic responsibilities - like having drains working. Most of these bodies are stacked with corrupt officials, almost all of whom are aligned to some political party or the other, which makes them immune to both shame and responsibility.
On the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi envisions smart cities for India. Where these cities will have the best infrastructure and the finest amenities, and thus will be "smart" compared to the dull inefficient cities we have today. Hopefully, these cities will have people helming it who are sincere, hard-working and honest. A tall order but then since when was hope an outcaste?
For the last two-three days, all of Delhi and Gurgaon was flooded. Roads gave way to rivers. In many places, the road itself had caved in, morphing into giant waterfalls. Not one official was found anywhere. No one was in charge. Chief Ministers who would otherwise make foolish utterances maintained a stony silence whilst the hapless citizen suffered: like the hapless citizen always does. There was the usual apathy, the usual noise on television, lots of citizenry rage, but then nothing. All sound and fury but no clear action on the ground, which, by the way, has become the Indian leitmotif. 
And all of this when we talk about Delhi as the capital of India which is at the cusp of greater world glory, and Gurgaon as the show-window of what we can do in terms of real-estate. Many condominiums in Gurgaon command the highest rate per square foot in the country. They boast of uninterrupted power supply, swimming pools and club houses, all of which sound very nice for a brochure, but then when you also have to swim to your pool, reality bites.
Gurgaon is also home to some of India's largest corporations: CEOs and young people alike live and work in Gurgaon. Meetings on future investments are held in luxury hotels there, and yet what a goddamn shame when these very potential investors see the havoc that is wreaked by one rainfall. A tsunami didn't hit us nor did an earthquake. It was just torrential rain that brought both Delhi and Gurgaon to its knees.
Why does every metropolis in India resemble a dysfunctional slum? Why do our municipal bodies work as if they are living in the Dark Ages? Why can't the common citizen except common benefits when they are paying taxes and electing what we believe are decent people? 
I believe the fault lies with us as much as it does with the authorities. We are easily swayed when it comes to greasing palms when we need our illegal work legalized. We station our cars in places which are clearly marked 'no parking'. Many contractors dump construction material and debris on roads instead of getting rid of it properly. There is unplanned construction and the Mafiosi nexus between builder-politician-police exists to this day no matter what Modi might say about corruption. We have a tolerant and diseased mindset when it comes to corruption of our own making, but we are first to scream and shout if that corruption impacts us in the most heinous way. That is our tragedy as citizens.
We are loath to complaining about the corruption which causes this mess since many a time we partake of it. We are scared of the establishment so we won't hold them accountable. We are easy to please: so once the rains stop, so do our worries and our anger. But this is not the way forward for any civilized society. Or for that matter for a media which pretends to be a watchdog most of the time but is weak on follow-up.
Something needs to give. We need to unshackle ourselves from the burdens of this annual misery and the only way we can do this is to identify people including Chief Ministers and take them to Court since the judiciary seems to be the only thing they fear and respect. We need to take them to the cleaners as it were, as also those citizens and/or builders who through some machinations have created a living hell for us common folk. But the time to act is now and not wait till next year.
Our ability to forget and forgive is our biggest weakness, which the Establishment exploits unabashedly.
My belief is that unless we shame these civic officials publicly and shame the politicians who are constantly running amuck, nothing will change. We can then keep living in squalor and fear as also disease. We can continue to boast of living in Delhi or Gurgaon whilst even Hell would be more attractive and be in this false reverie that we are doing fine. We are not getting the basics and yet we have to fear the taxman and comply with paying taxes.
The solution quite simply is to protest; shame and take these jokers to court. They don't understand civility. And they never will. No matter who they are and of which political dispensation.(Suhel Seth is Managing Partner of Counselage: India's only strategic brand advisory.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            I totally agree, let's take Modi to the court his party BJP is the one which has been heading MCD of Delhi and has won 3 times consecutively. What a Shame, this party even after a decade has not been able to do anything to improve the poor infrastructure under which Delhi has been reeling  ..

                            It is even more frustrating when the municipal authorities sleep all through the summer and start digging the roads for 'approaching monsoons' just a week before the predicted date. Is their work only an eye-wash?

                            One aspect of the article rings true. First shame yourself. Politicians are corrupt because the public gives them money for out of the way favours. What was the Vyapam scam all about? And every other scam was because we elect unprincipled politicians to power because they will then oblige us. Why do we elect criminals and fraudsters? Because we have no other choice? No, because honest politicians are not electable. They will not do our bidding. Why did Manmohan Singh never win an election? We Indians are like this only. Politicians only hold up a mirror to our own corrupt face. Like it or lump it, we deserve this. Bad roads and flooded streets are what we deserve. We keep our homes neat but throw garbage on every street, and convert parks and public places into toilets. You want to shame politicians for this? Go take a hike.

                            So we will take the CMs to the court! It sounds amazing but not even remotely close to the reality. Bloody, even film actors like #SalmanKhan gets away with culpable homicide, there is no system in existence in this "Great Country, with best culture in the World" (sigh!) to take any politician to the court and actually punish him/her. <br/>
1. As a civilian I am scared of politician. Even a low-life criminal becomes "Corporator" of the area and there is nothing we can do.<br/>
2. As a civilian I am scared of police and law system. The only motto of police is to seek opportunity to get some money out from any case let it be a murder, rape,child abuse, fraud case and there is nothing we can do.<br/>
3. As a civilian I am scared of the judiciary system. People with money, power can buy/threaten any judge in the country and can get a bail next day and there is nothing we can do.<br/>
No politician in India has and will get punished in this count

                            The root  cause for all these problems are the British. They didn't show the vision that rulers should show and didn't plan the cities accordingly. They had short term vision and built infrastructure only for the areas that they occupied. So South Mumbai never floods, Lutyens Delhi never floods and I guess similar must be the story in the rest of country. If the British had shown some vision and planned for the cities 60 years into the future taking into account the population in India, we would not be facing these problems today. Mr Seth, if you want to hold someone accountable, please hold the Queen of Britain responsible.

                            @manak1947: "In 2002, India banned the production of plastic bags below 20 µm in thickness to prevent plastic bags from clogging of the municipal drainage systems and to prevent the cows of India ingesting plastic bags as they confuse it for food. However, enforcement remains a problem."<br/><br/>
Problem is with us. We do not want to change ourselves or take any effort to stop using plastic bags.<br/>
How many times you have carry cloth/ 'bio-degradable' bag to buy stuffs from market?<br/>
Many time even for stuff like breads, milk packet, or any packed stuff we ask shopkeeper to provide the plastic bags to carry them.<br/>
In Himachal Pradesh, the use of plastic bag is banned. Shimla is one of the places where I have not seen shopkeeper/people using plastic bags.<br/>
Hence if government has failed to enforce the ban on plastic bags but we as the consumer should strictly say NO to plastic bags and instead carry our cloth/ 'bio-degradable' bags.

                            Dear Mr Seth, There is a simple solution to all the issues and problems that you list out here. That is to curtail the time period of the elected politicians from a luxurious 5 years to 3 years. This will keep them on their toes when they live with the fear of facing the electorate sooner. But who will make this change? the POLITICIANs? TOUGH LUCK! Till then keep suffering for 5 years!

                            We Indians have a tendency to find a way to circumvent the problem instead of solving it. On top of that we have our priorities screwed up. It doesn't take much to put pressure on the authorities. For example everyone should write one letter to their respective municipality, MLA and MP to address key problems in their neighborhood. If 10% of the people does this, authorities will get more than one carore letters in a year.

They must be booked  at the highest level.They can not remain or called honorable otherwise.

                            firstly sir,<br/><br/>
In the above mention arguments, i didn't understand the relation of officials accepting bribes and the rest content of the arguments.<br/>
and we cannot directly blame chief ministers for such a kind of mishap.<br/>
a legal procedure is to be followed firstly and then some solution can be placed.<br/>
directly making some one responsible for such a kind of mishap is not a way to solution.<br/>
On the contrary, i totally agree that civic bodies are responsible for such kind of choking especially in metropolis cities like delhi<br/>
and it's the matters of the whole system and not the individual.<br/>
and one of the most best solution you mentioned was of improving the root level causes to move towards smart cities.<br/>
i hope my arguments suffice the above opinion.
