Headline::::'PK' Gets No Support From Bollywood



DateTime::::2014-12-30T22:55:00+05:30



(Shobhaa De is an established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator, who is considered an authority on popular culture.)I was on a television panel discussion on Monday. Yup. Same one on which the anchor provides all the answers to questions asked by the nation. The topic was volatile (widespread vandalism of theatres screening the Aamir Khan starrer 'PK' in Ahmedabad, Bhopal and elsewhere) but the panelists were thanda. The panelists who were supposed to condemn the violence, that is. While those defending the disgraceful shenanigans belonged to right wing political/religious outfits, the three of us representing the 'voice of the people' were disappointingly muted. Well, I tried my best to be heard over the din of smug, self-appointed custodians of Hindu sentiments, but it was a frustrating and pointless exercise. I asked why the channel had not invited someone more 'tagda' to represent Bollywood.The reply didn't surprise me - nobody of any importance from the movie industry wanted to speak up  - for the principle, not an individual.For the wrongness of what took place. Not for Aamir Khan. Or Raju Hirani. Or even the contents of the controversial movie. Speak up against these sort of intimidatory tactics. Speak up for our threatened freedoms. Speak up for democracy. Speak up for peaceful protests. Speak up for our own future, for heaven's sake!Why? Bollywood is scared. Bollywood  has reasons to be scared. Very scared.And this is the real story: Bollywood is vulnerable. Perhaps more vulnerable than any other sector in India. It has always been this way. In earlier times, when Bollywood itself was run in an erratic, unprofessional and disorganized fashion, it was easier for anti-social elements to exercise control over the film industry. These 'elements' were dangerous and armed. They resorted to direct threats, blackmail and murder. The motive was money. Bollywood was a soft target for extortionists looking to make a killing the easy way. It was hard to stand up to these goons...and still stay alive. Some who tried to take on the underworld paid for it heavily.Perhaps, this was when the term 'setting' was coined. It was a polite way of admitting you had done a deal with the 'Bhais'. Yes, it was hard to handle outright threats back then in the late 80s and early 90s.Apparently it's even harder now.Even though the Bhais are still around, the Bollywood model of doing business has changed. Bollywood is corporatized these days and run more professionally by men and women wearing Armani, not sleazeballs in polyester safari suits. But hello! The monies generated by superhits have gone through the roof, too! ('PK' has grossed Rs.233 crores already). The vultures are still circling the big studios. But there are new players on the scene who exercise muscle power and political clout to boot. Bollywood continues to run scared. There is no place to hide. I don't blame big stars, producers, directors for not jumping into the latest 'PK' imbroglio. They simply can't afford the risk! There is far too much at stake and nobody wants to commit professional hara-kiri by challenging the might of shadowy outfits claiming to represent the majority.This is such a shame. If Bollywood had indeed decided to take a joint stand and speak in one voice this time, perhaps the film industry would have benefitted in the long run. After all, this sort of wanton destruction serves no real purpose. It is not Aamir or Raju paying the price for the 'protests' - it is theatre owners! The movie has been cleared across the board. As chief of the censor board, Leela Samson has issued a sane statement in the wake of the debate. The Supreme Court's directives are abundantly clear. The film has been screened without any incident for 10 long days. All of a sudden there are violent reactions? Come on.Is it cowardice or good sense that dictates how Bollywood reacts to threats? I'd say it's both. Silence has become the standard. Which, in a way, implies surrender. Most stars shy away from engaging in larger issues that concern the film industry. They remain obstinately non-committal. Or genuinely indifferent. This is just so short-sighted and selfish. If the big wigs in Bollywood get together and form a strong , singular body to represent their interests across the board, such attacks can be better addressed. It is not merely Aamir's problem or Hirani's problem. It involves everybody! Bollywood tends to segregate and compartmentalize crises, with zero show of unity when it is most required - like now.Soon the 'PK' attacks will die down. But there will be more. Of that we can be sure. What then? Will Bollywood continue to play ostrich? Suffer amnesia and laryngitis? One hopes not...for its own sake.There's nothing as sinister as the silence of the lambs...Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Did Shoba De speak out against Protests over Youtube film Fitna or the film for which hundreds were killed around the world? Bravado comes easy as long as its not about islamists.

                            Hinduism is the only religion that does not impose their beliefs on others. I mean that within Hinduism we have strands that are pro idol worship, the vedic Indians are not idol worshipper but unlike Islam where Mohammed went demolishing idols of pagan worshipper Hindus allowed people who wanted to use symbols as idols to relate to reality. Now to mock that with out understanding the ancient tolerant approach of Hindus which accommodated idol worshippers, aiethist and Vedic Hindus who do not believe in idol worship in one thread. Hinduism is much more tolerant and broad as it sees after all believing in idols or not is still belief. So no belief is above others beliefs and so we accept different paths to understand reality. Now some may want to use symbols to understand reality which may be absurd for us rational people but we Hindus have allowed people to use whatever approach that suits them to relate to reality. I mean no approach is superior to other after all worshipping idols or not are still in realm of beliefs and so needs to be discarded at later stage to achieve full understanding of reality. They are seen as ladder to take us to that level because the reality is too abstract and if someone wants to give symbol to it that is fine and is equally respected in our culture. I think the pseudo seculars and bollywood are being intolerant here for not understanding point of view of idol worshippers.

                            Really bold and courageous film criticising all superstitions and bad things in Hindu panth.  I hope next time Aamir, Vidhu and other bold Bollywood persons will pierce into the bad things of Islam. I am sure Aamir has the guts to take on them also.  Does he?  Or is it like that that it is the easiest way to abuse a softest and most adjusting panth and make money too?  Would Shobha ji also try to persuade Aamir for his next such adventure?

                            @Aron: secularists like her show off their secularism only for 1 religion that is Hinduism. Just because Hindus tolerate all that. So these people take advantage of it and make their earnings. Wake up Hindus. This "liberal" tag not helping. This is all conspiracy to kill the culture.

Its simple, the film made fun of hindu gods mostly unlike OMG where every religion is accounted..and the entire PK film crew should take responsibility of this and apologize and ban the movie..

Are you missing a parity here !!!!! <br/>
Hinduism like any other religion has ills and lots of things to be rectified. As wise people has said, Religion is flawed, because men are flawed. But in a multi-religious country like ours, why will only one religion be at the scrutinization all the time for commercial gains?

                            No need to say that PK was an ordinary movie with a sleek presentation . The ills of Hindus could have been presented in a better way for a rethinking. The way ,it was shown looked more insulting and in bad light. The ills of other religions were just had a light brushing but the major act was on Hindus . Inspite of it many Hindus watched ,gave the Producers a heavy profit which indicates the hidden tolerance of Hindu religion . Lately the VHP /BD have violently objected to it which was perhaps expected by the producers to improve further collection at the box office !!!!

                            Hello all check the movie maalamaal goal mask something released in 2012 the censor board has deleted the scenes which cd potentially hurt the religious sentiments of Catholics specifically, 1st of all the most disturbing thing in this entire episode is Hindus being the majority religion sd be callous to the extent of being least bothered about any jokes cracked abt their faith, also can aamir being a Muslim support the Danish cartoon joking about non availability of women in heaven hence jihad had to be stopped, being sensible to others is one of the main responsibility of any movie maker when they don't follow that it's just a proof that the person is only after money, if anybody thinks out of decency Hindus keep their mouths shut despite of being hurt I don't think it's fair, I'm not being extreme but I'm being reasonable.

                            As an atheist I would like to convey inconvenient truth. From 1947 to till date India is ruling by majority religion officers and staffs. Everyday Indian government is running by IAS officers and Government officers and staffs. This officers and staffs belong to Majority religion. Lot of corruptions we can see their department. The inconvenient truth is they are doing bad to their religion people. My question is did they learn anything from their religion ?? or money is blocking their religion thoughts ?? then How they can tell they are following particular religion ??

                            Whenever the response to any intended stimulus is not in consonance to expectations, it becomes incumbent upon the communicator to review the response and take it as feed-forward to examine and explore the possible gap. <br/><br/>
May be there are segments in the audience( receivers of the message) who are over sensitive and one cannot be blissfully indifferent to this dynamics.<br/><br/>
Sometimes it's worth going back to the drawing board to check where things went wrong and make amends where required. <br/><br/>
Afterall the purpose of communication through any media is to share the intended message with clarity sans misrepresentation. <br/><br/>
That would be the summit of censorship - a self exploratory process

                            Films are meant for entertainment and may serve the purpose of social awakening at times. But it should not be taken too far as it hurts believers, irrespective of which religion or sect a person belongs. Freedom of expression comes with this rider always.

                            Madam, criticism against wrong traditions &amp; practices is well accepted. There's absolutely no problem with that. If poured milk over deities is simply wasted then it should be stopped with immediate effect. I think people have accepted the movie very well. That is why movie ran full houses for 10 days. Question arises about creators of film whether they will create sequel of this movie in which they will show worst practices in the world's two biggest religion. Let them declare they have criticised only against Indian sick practices and they will expose other religions as well in the Sequel. Whole matter ends there. Will they do that? They don't have guts. They are bringing movies only with money as the only aim.

                            Babas are making money from Devotees, Aamir and company making money by critising them, Shobha de making money by commenting. Money Money makes the world GO!!!Lage Raho Amir Baba Shobha! Yeh logon ko entertainment karke paise kamaye to koi problem nahi aur baba log logon ko dilasa deke paise kamaye to inko problem. Shobha de ke maje hai dono hi sides se comment karne ke liye use paise to milenge hi! Jai Ho! Amir bada na baba, beta sabse bada rupaaiya! Jo mudde Amir ne uthaye hai jis tarah se uthaye hai wo sadiyon se Santo ne samaj sudharakon ne uthaye hai! Aap ko pata hogi Shivji par dudh chadhane ki kahani. Bahut Purani hai. Ek bar ek raja ne Ekadas ko elan kiya ki gaon ke shiv mandir me pindi ko dudha chadake Garbhgriha ko bhar diya jayega. Sab ko comapulsaory tha. Sabne jitna dudh Gayon/Bhaisone diya sara Garbhgriha me chadha diya. Isse unke bacche, bachade aur bimar ko dudh na mil saka par Garbhagriha na bhara. Aur bhi dudh laya gaya par garbhagriha na bhar saka. Gaon me ek budhiya rahti thi. Usne apne sab bachho, poton ko dudh diya, bachade ko pet bhar dudh pine diya, bimaron ko pine diya phir bach hua sa chota pyala lekar mandir pahoonchi. Aur Achraj ki baat dekho jaise hi usne dudh chadhaya, garbhgriha bhar gaya. Raja ne karan pucha to woh boli ke kisi ko dukhi rakh kar bhagwan ki seva nahi ho sakti.<br/><br/>
Ab is tarah ki kafi kahaniyan pahle bhi logonko maloom hai phir bhi log nahi sudhare. Aamir bhai ne bhi phir se aise hi kahani suna kar paise batore hai. Une mein aur baba logon mein muze koi fark nahi dikhta! Kya kahte ho!!

                            It has become a fashion on part of media to show a secular face without adopting a pragmatic approach. It Is not just some outfits affiliated to BJP are opposing, but every person who has understood the ideologies propagated by Makers/actors of PK are opposing this movie. <br/><br/>
Questioning the idol worship, "Joh Dar Gaya woh Mandir Gaya", Showing lord Shiva  as a comic figure is really anti Hindu.<br/><br/>
Sensor board did not take a holistic approach before certifying this movie. Govt of India should fire the censor board chief and appoint a more Secular person.<br/><br/>
I have seen a mini truck load of poor people brought by a christian missionary to  watch this movie. I believe the objective might be to brainwash them to believe that Hinduism is a Joke. This movie will become a case study to propagate anti Hindu sentiments. It was really shocking to see this happen when i went to watch this movie on a Christmas day.  Damage had already been done and the makers of PK should apologize to Hindu community.

                            well, well, Madam, you are really creative. You have managed to blame Sangh parivar for even the silence of Bollywood. Bollywood does not protest aganist casting couch, it does not protest when heroines are threatened, it does not care when heroines commit suicide, it does not care when its producers are shot , why would it care for PK ? They might just be selfish gits. Has it occurred to you that they may even have opposite views to Team PK ? Some of them are quite conservative and religious. perhaps they also feel PK has gone too far. Perhaps they are hurt by the scenes in PK. Perhaps they are not coming in support of Pk because Aamir Khan is a selfish git who never comes out in support for anyone. I remember a TV debate when you defended Preity Zinta beautifully, passionately and talked about how actresses are also normal women and vulnerable to violence. Not a single person from Bollywood participated in that debate either.

                            The human body is itself considered a temple. In fact, the basic architecture of a Hindu temple is based on the human body. So to your ignorant, off-handed question, this is the answer.<br/>
Hinduism has an unfathomable depth of thought, practice and ways. Realize your folly my fellow "Indian".

                            Ms De, I am afraid you miss the point. The protests that are raging this time are not like the earlier protests against some films' content in the past, when a few goondas, in the garb of protectors of the Hindu culture ran amok vandalising theatres. There is genuine anguish among a large section of the population against the wanton desecration of the Hindu ideologies and rituals. Taking this lying down is nothing short of bending to the mavericks, who keep kicking the Hindus in the head and expect them to be 'broad minded, magnanimous and large hearted'. The protests have to be strong enough and loud enough to make the Censor Board sit up and take notice. If the Bollywood fraternity has not raised their voice, it would be presumptuous to assume that they were "scared". It could also be that a number of them agree that Hirani has indeed crossed the line this time around. By being overtly critical of the Hindu religion, with just a passing mention about the mores and excesses of other religions, Raju Hirani has done a disservice to the majority community. Just because you are sitting in a panel discussion, do not try to be politically correct and appear to encourage the so called 'freedom of expression'. Religion is a personal preference : NO ONE has a right to interfere, far less ridicule one's religious preferences/practices. They need not be violent, but they need to be voluble enough. Only then will we able to curb such misadventures by the purveyors of free expression. We do not approve of Dream merchants becoming merchants of malice.

                            Bollywood has several people with bling faith and I am not surprised that they are not supporting PK. I saw PK in the USA. It is a great movie. Amir Khan has ability to come out with great movies. I will completely ignore fanatic people.

                            Shoba ji 99 % times i agree with you, but why to take issues which will never get set right . Iam not pecimistic but these are faith related issues which need not be many times with modern thinking. Also neither the director or Aamir khan are experts in Bhagvadgita,Bible or  Quran.<br/><br/>
By one picture they can give entertainment but cannot change the faith of people which is in Blood.

                            Both Protesting and the  freedom to  make controversial movies  are valid and OK in a democracy.  Breaking laws should be handled with  rule of law!<br/>
However politicians trying to make  capital   with vote bank politics is  to be condemned.
