Headline::::Smriti Irani, Superb Orator, Problematic Educator



DateTime::::2016-02-27T06:06:00+05:30




                                In the last two days, HRD Minister Smriti Irani, the youngest face of PM Narendra Modi's cabinet, has given two speeches in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha respectively. Both speeches have been lauded for their emotional value and eloquence with Irani quoting generously from sources including Macbeth and Roman philosopher Cicero. As I write this, Parliament proceedings have been held hostage by a fight over Smriti Irani's display of nude pictures of a Goddess allegedly published by students of JNU.
The debate over the last two days which started off with a discussion over Rohit Vemula's suicide and the JNU controversy sought serious answers from the HRD minister, but turned into a shallow display of victimhood and misplaced sexism. Not just did the minister holding one of the highest offices of the Indian government mislead the parliament with incorrect facts, but she also reduced the HRD, once helmed by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, to an all-time low.
A sample of the few misplaced arguments and statements placed by Irani in both the houses are stated below. Armed with brilliant dialogue delivery skills (and I am not alluding to her acting career), Irani, like her senior Sushma Swaraj, has emerged as a superb orator from her party. However, nothing that Irani has said so far has answered any of the questions raised by Vemula's suicide, or dealt with the allegations of the minister taking her orders from the RSS."Main aapse se kehti hun agar mere jawab se aap santusht nahi ho, toh iss sabha main kehti hun Mayawati ji, main BSP ke ek-ek karyakarta aur aapke netaon se kehti hun, sar kalam karke aapke charnon mein chhod denge." (Answering Mayawati on Rohith Vemula - "If you are not satisfied with my reply, I will cut my head and offer it at your feet.")"Apne kartavya ka paalan karne ke liye aap mujhe suli par chadha rahe the, Amethi ladne ki ye saza denge aap mujhe." (To the Congress - "Are you exacting revenge for my contesting the election from Amethi?") Â 
"Mera naam Smriti Irani hai, meri jaat par aarop lagakar dekhiye." (In defence of her ministry in the case of Rohit Vemula's suicide - "I am Smriti Irani. I challenge you to question my caste.")
"What a lovely conversation to have with a lady, bravo, nature's call." (This is what she said when Sitaram Yechury said he had to excuse himself to answer nature's call).
If these comments have baffled you, more confusing were the anomalies placed by the minister in the House:
"Nobody allowed a doctor near this child, to revive this child, to take him to the hospital. Nobody allowed a doctor near him. The police has reported that not one attempt was made to take him to a doctor. Instead what was done was that his body was used as a political tool," said Irani on Rohith Vemula not being rushed to the hospital after he was found hanging in his hostel room.
Rajasree Malpath, Chief Medical Officer of the University of Hyderabad's health centre, told The Telegraph, "I reached the room where Vemula was found within five minutes of receiving an alert (around 7:30 pm on January 17). His body was beyond revival. The body was cold, stiff and rigid, with signs of rigor mortis (a stiffening of the muscles and limbs in the body that begins about two hours after death)... I examined the body for 10 minutes and declared him dead."
Irani then flayed the JNU students for their celebrations of Mahishasur - the black demon who was slayed by Durga - a destruction referred to by the students as an upper caste and racist practice. The dramatic twist continued when Smriti shifted to Bengali to ask if parliamentarians and others would tolerate this practice in West Bengal.
Of course, no one must have mentioned to her that a Dalit member and MP from her own party, Udit Raj, had attended the celebration of Mahishasur in 2013, a fact tweeted by him where he also mentioned that no blasphemous speech was made.

Irani also lashed out at charges of communalizing the HRD but with flawed arguments. She used tried and tested tokenism and spoke of a Kashmiri Muslim student who was given a fellowship as an example of her ministry's secular approach, but in the process, ended up exposing herself when she conveniently ignored the notice sent by her ministry to the Pondicherry University to check if the institute was being 'Islamised' by a professor who, coincidentally, is also a Kashmiri.A report dated January 28, 2016 titled "When HRD ministry ordered a probe into a complaint about 'Islamisation' of Pondicherry University" published documents that her ministry allegedly sent to the Pondicherry University which later formed a three-member committee to look into the matter.
The report, which was later published by other news media along with documents, proves why Irani cannot dismiss charges of towing the agenda of the RSS and its affiliates.
The complaint was filed by a Delhi-based organisation called Patriots Forum, alleging that the university had been 'Islamised' under one of its former vice-chancellors, JAK Tareen.
The letter, which is on various news websites, states:"The process [Islamisation] started with Dr. JAK Tareen taking over as the Vice Chancellor on March 16 in 2007 and continued in an unbroken run over 6 years till February 1, 2013. Whether in the selection of faculty or admission of students, the stamp of gradual Islamisation of the Pondicherry living was clear all through. A good number of Muslim students were from Kashmir, raising a clear suspicion that some among them could be genuine terrorists. Do not, Madam, all these make one believe that it was a planned strategy to develop a strong hold for the minority community in this part of the country?[sic]"
The three-member committee gave a 'clean chit' to the Professor, also a Kashmiri, who had to prove his patriotism on official orders. The report also goes on to state that the University had only 22 faculty members of the Muslim community, accounting for 5.9 per cent of the total teaching staff.
Smriti Irani, you said in the Rajya Sabha, "Do not demean my patriotism. Do not demean my idea of India." Is this your idea of India?
The notice sent to Pondicherry University is a brazen example of the distortion of the HRD Ministry which is meant to educate and inspire the mindset of an entire generation, but instead, launches an investigation based on charges levelled by self-confessed bearers of nationalism and Hindutva.
In doing this, Irani has most certainly ensured that she will continue to retain the HRD department by being in the good books of the Sangh Parivaar with her overzealous patriotism. Not just this, Smriti has also subtly conveyed the Sangh's stated line on "caste" with the Mahishasur reference in her speech.
But if one could borrow lines from her own emotional terminology, Irani has shamed the death of a son who could have well been termed an anti-national if he was alive. Yes Smriti Irani, we are talking of Rohith Vemula, and please let's honour him in his death and get the facts straight.(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer.

                            well, seems like you suffer from short term memory loss as you missed out some crucial info related to Rohit's episode<br/><br/>
The Police investigated and confirmed that Rohit's family got a fake caste certificate. (Rohit's mother's entire relatives have confirmed that<br/>
they are not SC/ST).<br/><br/>
Why was the body of Rohit was handled and relocated before police/doctors could come in? Why??? What has transpired between that time?<br/><br/>
Who strike off the last paragraph of Rohit's suicide note?<br/><br/>
stop spreading lies... it won't work..

                            Looks like Bengal elections preparations have begun. Smriti Irani raising Durga-Mahishasur issue in parliament is an indication of RSS- BJP desired fragmentation of electorate Bengal have both - worshippers of Durga and Mahishasur and one can be set against other.

This is what's been happening ever since this democratically elected govt has come to Centre. Many people are not digesting this fact as they are used to dynastic monarch ruling over the country - before and after independence! The matters are in courts - let them give the final verdict and we should not jump on conclusions or even delusions! People are supreme and we should respect people's choice and wait till the year 2019. Till then let them perform without unnecessary disturbances."!

                            Government have every right to check and balance, that is the reason its government. I wish you award winning writer could be a bit more mature and in her argument ask HRD minister to give judgement which is not her responsibility its either commission in case of HCU and Judiciary in case of JNU. Once they deliver you have all your answers who is right or wrong. Neither you not any of your alliance have right or capacity to judge these cases unless the machinery provides some facts.<br/><br/>
All you can do is to rant and mock government for everything they do and that is in your fundamental right either morally, ethically its obnoxious or not. You all are learned enough to know that due process in underway but comfortably ignore as it doesn't suit your argument. Fair enough ... politics for a investigative journalist.<br/><br/>
Enjoy writing your Narendra Modi book. We all know already the direction of the book already. Even he might be happy the way his life folded in your book but nobody will be wondered.

                            What is wrong in sending a letter to a university to investigate? If proved wrong, that is good for the country. If proved right, it could be early detection and acting accordingly. So you mean to say the so called "self-confessed bearers of nationalism and Hindutva" but will act fast of complained by some 'secular' element?

would you trust FIR of the Police OR the statement of the doctor? Why didn't the doctor said the same when police were preparing FIR?<br/><br/>
The MP in question was attended the Mahishasur function when he wasn't even a BJP MP. How could you link his actions of that time to BJP now? This is an outright lie.<br/><br/>
Why don't you also question why the body of Rohit was touched and relocated before police arrive at the scene? Why didn't the students took him to the Hospital when they took the liberty of bringing his body on to the floor?<br/><br/>
It would be very kind of you to answer these questions.

                            Ms Rana Ayyub, please don't lie. Smriti Irani had said "My name is Smriti Irani, and I challenge you to tell my Caste." I believe you have conveniently  changed the statement to suit you or for the convenience of Nehru Dynasty TV

1. Does anybody even remember the last HRD minister for good or bad reasons ? <br/>
2. History has shown us that the best leaders have not been the most educated lot - Ashoka, Akbar. In order to coach or lead well you need not have been the best player of the game. Education level of an individual is no guarantee for him to lead well. We have bad examples all around wherein people have misused their positions for their self.<br/><br/>
It is the intent and integrity towards your work which delivers for people.

                            Smriti irani needs to know loud articulate passionate arguments are not same as legally tenable, morally upright and or even common sensical statements. It borders on I am more virtuous, we BJP are lesser if not smaller thieves than congress -  and assumes a moral uprightness by casting some students as bhatke. As if she has just learnt of this and that this is happening for the first time in India or elsewhere -  and so engages in falsities, misreads, misleading and above all dangerous bravado -  In this she assumes the country can be taken for ride. And unprovoked she goes to say the new JNU VC was appointed by president. While in reality - he is a RSS patron with the connivance of messrs. Ram Madhav, GVLN Rao and more -  And Smriti Irani tries to hoodwink by saying her nominated person also rss lineage was not selected by the president - lies, damn lies and fraud all the way. The RSS wants to rewrite history and is openly seeking to fill every campus with their choicest VCs and ABVP leaders. Smriti Irani should go back to at least a local univ if not yale and try to get a true degree -  annd be not a nautankirani. Sic! India deserves better than such a morally depraved misleading fraud, who is worser than the students who had the courage to at least acknowledge their depraved quotes and writings. India is going truly sicular by the day with this govt at the helm

Chaiwala PM knows that the TV actress has lot of acting potential and advised her publicly previous day to act aggressively. This uneducated TV actress forgot she is education minister and exhibited all her acting skills to her best ability, with all lies, thinking we are all fools watching soap opera. The idiot box acting is better place for this uneducated lady and not education ministry. Only God can save India from such bunch of jokers.

Ms. irani during her speech had put forth many points, except for some i think you dont have objections to other points. in rohit s case she has given police report as her basis for making comments , so she is not responsible for wrong police report. <br/>
our universities are not know for any extraordinary work in field of education except politics. <br/>
i think time has come to cancell all the student elctions and representation on student body should be strictly on the basis of knowledge , skills , other activities like sports literature art etc. universities should shortlist students on these points and students will  select their representatives only from  this list . political leannings should go out of universities.

Their only objective is to (so called) support the Muslim community and create communal tension. She is no way compared to Smriti Irani who is not only highly literate (qualifications are not the yardsticks), highly sensible and completely dedicated to the nation. I am not sure how our country will get rid of people like Rana

                            Excellent article Rana Ayyub. Always speak the truth what come may. These bunch of egoistic jokers need to be taught a lesson, if not they will destroy India. Please weild your pen which is mightier than sword.

                            Instead of answering some serious questions, she took an emotional approach and made statements which were illogical and deprived of facts.she clearly deviated from the course of the debate. Meanwhile the 'Bhakts' were too happy.
