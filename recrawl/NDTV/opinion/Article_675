Headline::::Ranveer Singh Is Like Chicken Manchurian



DateTime::::2015-06-25T17:36:00+05:30




                                Ranveer Aala Re, Aala...
I have been a die-hard Govinda fan for years. Can't say the same about Ranveer. That they are both naturals goes without saying. But in my mind, Govinda is more like ghar ka khaana - comfort food. Ranveer is a hybrid. He is Chicken Manchurian. Both men have a brilliant sense of comic timing. Both are highly intelligent. But being products of an entirely different era in Bollywood, it's unlikely their career paths will run parallel.
Govinda liked to be referred to as the Virar ka Chhokra. This deliberate positioning was no fluke. Virar is an outpost of Mumbai. The 'real' Mumbai doesn't recognise the existence of a suburb called Virar. Nobody boasts of being from Virar. When Govinda was the big hero with several commercial blockbusters under his broad rexine belt, his rivals were Bandra Boys - the Pali Hill, Juhu-Khar lot with well-connected patrons in the film industry. They fancied themselves (still do!) as being upmarket and posh. 
Then there was Govinda - Chi Chi to friends. A podgy, unlikely hero, with a disarming smile. Unapologetically middle class and minus starry airs (those came later), Govinda was hailed as the aam janta's hero - a basic, daal-chaawal type of guy. Nobody could explain his success. Suddenly Govinda was everywhere! He had delivered! He was a bona fide star! His style of dancing was the rage, and the same snooty heroines who had refused roles with him earlier lined up eagerly to match steps with the latest box office wonder. His dialogue delivery was referred to in reverential terms, and supporters made the lyrics of his incredibly vulgar songs appear cool and catchy when they were seriously offensive and ludicrous. 
I met Govinda when he had already become a bloated monster. His habitual lateness (10 hours was normal), lack of discipline, and delusions of grandeur  had producers fuming by then. But so long as the hits rolled in, lips stayed sealed. I had warned the enthusiastic Stardust Annual team that even though I was the actor's fan, and happy to do a special shoot for the magazine, I wasn't willing to come to a studio or wait around at home for him to show up. As it turned out, the photo session and interview were fixed at my home, and a minion was assigned the job of tracking Govinda who was shooting in the suburbs. Two hours after the stipulated time, when there was no trace of the man, I told them I had had enough and to pack up. 
Just then, there was a flurry of excitement - Govinda was in the building! He walked in wearing a cop's uniform and apologised for being in costume. He must have been feeling pretty sheepish about his lateness, for without wanting to waste more time, he started stripping right there in my living room as his wardrobe guy fluttered around with a fresh shirt. Minutes later, he was ready. And that's when the Govinda Moment took place. The editors had thoughtfully prepared a set of questions he was supposed to ask me ("Class versus Mass'' was the rather insulting peg). Govinda stared at the sheet of paper and promptly tore it up. He turned to me with a big grin and asked politely, "Shall we start?"
That's the essential Govinda - spontaneous, endearing and very nuts.
I don't know Ranveer at all. The only time I saw him was at a formal function where he was seated across the aisle. This was just after he had signed his first film but was not famous. His conduct was exaggerated, exhibitionistic, loud and attention-seeking. He was also ridiculously dressed. Who is this guy, people were wondering, watching his antics. It hardly mattered. Once his first big movie was released, nobody needed to ask that question. He had aggressively and very quickly established himself in Bollywood. And he wasn't going anywhere! Well, he's still around. And getting better with every role. His public conduct continues to be brash, but nobody cares so long as audiences love him.
A few months ago, he was invited to a rarefied Conclave in Delhi. He was in the company of some top-class professionals from various fields. Of course, there was a full house for him (he's a big star today), but not too many people in the audience were expecting anything more than light Bollywood banter from the young actor. Imagine then, their shock and awe when Ranveer came through with what was dubbed one of the most polished presentations of the Conclave! Beyond the swagger was substance. Beyond the sharp suit was a thinking, alert, energetic mind. In a flash - Ranveer had transformed himself from a rakish Bollywood caricature to a polished brand ambassador representing the future of Bollywood.
Is he the next Govinda? Not really. So much has changed about the movies from the time when Govinda was thrusting his hips and shaking his booty with Bollywood lovelies. Govinda was never given the chance to unleash the supremely sensitive actor in him. Ranveer should learn from this and save himself from falling into a similar trap. For that, he really needs to lose those idiotic monkey suits he wears on the red carpet  - fast!(Shobhaa De is an established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator, who is considered an authority on popular culture.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            When I see Deepika...I feel she has pickup Ranvir just for the name sake. It's cheaper version of the other Ranbir. But deep inside she does know she is just doing this to burn Rabir. I don't see love in her eyes for Ranvir. He is a joker!

                            Why compare the 2 ? Govinda is a simple, uneducated lad from a conservative background. Ranveer was born to the  moneyed Bambhani family with a degree from USA. He does not take himself seriously &amp; cares a squat for what he wears , unlike his  bimbo cousin. Of course , he's not going to play the fool when it's a serious occasion.

                            What was the point of this article? In the end, what exactly was the comparison/similarity between the two? Govinda, according to me, was the god of comedy; and Ranveer is more like a failure who's best in being vulgar and cheap (that too in public). No decency, no morality and people call him star!! What the...<br/><br/>
As far as Ms. S. De is concerned, I guess the time is not in her favour that she has gone down to a level where she compares men with food items!!<br/><br/>
Wait a second! What if some male writer called Kangana a malai kofta? My guess is Ms. De would have been the first to start an agitation asking for apology! Hypocritic much..!!

                            I posted an earlier comment here. I don't know why it was not posted.<br/>
I was especially struck by the comments calling him vulgar, indecent, of low morals etc. etc., just based on his clothes and loud antics.  When did we start linking loud clothes to somebody's decency/morals or the lack of it?  He is just a hyper kid with a fascination for loud clothes. Maybe he is seeking attention as well, but can you really blame him for doing that in an industry crowded with the so-called superstars, star kids and their ilk? As long as he is not promoting obscenity with his public appearances, why the constant need to chastise him? There are bigger issues in Bollywood, with its nepotism and coteries, where the powerful (ab)use their power and money to award their favorites with plum roles and opportunities, at the expense of other actors and actresses, while insulting the audience's intelligence. If we do not see this, other upcoming actors will get fewer and fewer good roles, and the audience will soon forget them. If we do not see this, we'll be held hostage to a bloated system, where a few get to play favorites (never mind whether the protégés have talent or not) and choose who or what we'll watch on screen in a Bollywood movie.

                            Brilliant piece Shobha ji. For all I know and of all that I have seen, heard and felt, Ranveer cannot be any match for Govinda atleast not in the past and not in the present. Unfortunately, I am no Nostradamus otherwise I could have added the third dimension of time too! <br/><br/>
Ranveer is an attention seeking fellow who 'thinks' he is getting seen, heard and being acknowledged too but is an idiot if he thinks anything even close to all these. I am from Patna and I can tell you for sure that back in the 90s and 2000s, there was a big craze for the stumpy and chunky Govinda in the mofussil towns and villages where people mimicked him in every sense...his rainbow hued attire right to his yellow socks and his baring of gums every now and then. There was a sense of relatability that they felt with him. Ranveer on the other hand is lost....he is neither the folksy kinds nor the suave chic ones who struts on the stage with that whiff and elan.And in order to make up for this sorry figure of a non-person, he enters into his world of jarring acts and weird clothing which of late have gone above board. If at all he thinks that by getting into jump-suits(which are extremely ridiculous to say the least) and monkeying around in his handlebar mustache, he can tickle a bone or two, well, I am sure it would be the modesty of the audience to even bare their gums let alone a full-blooded laughter. He is a plain dumbass and an enfant terrible who has no substance nor style...but only his stupid antics....gestures (which often fall flat) and rumored affairs to live by. I also pity his rumored girlfriend which more often than not tend to be half baked gossips but even if that is true and here I would certainly ask...what did you find in his tomfoolery! Seriously, Ranveer needs to be fed on lessons in conducting himself in public life. People are least about your buffoonery in your private life but they certainly do find your acts maddening. Its high time, he alters his image and behaves like an adult in public life.
