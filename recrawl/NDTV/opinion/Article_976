Headline::::Pathankot Shows We Have Learnt No Lessons



DateTime::::2016-01-05T12:55:00+05:30




                                I've been holding off on writing this piece for more than 36 hours now. I didn't feel it would be appropriate to sit down and analyse the fallout of an attack that was still being responded to by our security forces. It's been a long 60 hours since news of the attack first came in. Once again, we are forced to ask ourselves difficult questions including whether we've learnt anything from previous attacks, and whether we truly value the sacrifices of our security forces. Unfortunately, the answer to both questions is a resounding "No", but I'll get to that.
I'm not clued in enough about the actual conduct of the operation or the handling of the intelligence that arose from the abduction of a Punjab Police officer in the area of Pathankot to do more than speculate about what might have happened. Like the rest of you, I have a lot of questions that I'm hoping, in due course, someone in the government will take the time to answer. How was it possible that even with prior intelligence about the presence of militants in the area, they were able to gain access to the airbase? If we had moved NSG and army units to the airbase, why were the veteran Defense Security Corps personnel the first responders?
It's almost as if we wanted the militants to gain entry to the base, rather than deal with them before they crossed the perimeter. Who was briefing the Union Home Minister that he announced, prematurely, the end of the operation, an operation that continued for almost two days AFTER his announcement and congratulatory tweet? Who was directing the government's media response? It was a shambles, to say the least. We had sources and government-friendly voices in the media patting individuals on the back for a job well done, and when things starting going belly up, the same sources were suddenly blaming the Punjab Police for ignoring vital intelligence. The government insisted on playing down the death toll when it was already clear that it was well past the figure of three that the government had been hard selling. Why? And finally, whose idea was it to have the PM make a speech about the benefits of yoga at a time like this? I'm not suggesting that he should have dropped everything and rushed back to Delhi, but in my opinion, a departure from the script to acknowledge what was happening in Pathankot wouldn't have gone amiss.
The truth is that for better or for worse, after the 25th of December, 2015, whatever happens between India and Pakistan will land squarely at the door of the Prime Minister. There is no cloak of deniability and no Teflon shield to protect him from any adverse developments - and developments don't come much more adverse than the deaths of seven brave security force personnel in an attack that has its origins in Pakistan, whether state-sponsored or rogue "enemies of humanity".
He was happy to be feted for his decision to drop in unannounced to meet his counterpart in Lahore, so now he can't pass on the criticism for the fallout of this attack to anyone else.
If anything, the quandary the Prime Minister and his advisers find themselves in is one of their own making. They were happy to play politics with similar situations when they were in the opposition and now suddenly cry foul when the same is done to them. Who can forget their "ten Pakistani heads for one Indian head", or the taunts of Dr Manmohan Singh being a weak PM because he wasn't ready to annihilate Pakistan every time we faced a terror attack from across the border? What about the oft-repeated "talks and terror can't go together"? Of course, people are going to dig out the old tweets of people like Mr Modi and Ms Swaraj and ask them what's changed between then and now, except that now they are in government.
That's why I'd suggested in a previous column that it was time for PM Modi to call the Congress/UPA leadership to brief them about developments with Pakistan so that this process could be insulated from political attacks. Alas, I think that boat has well and truly sailed.
I was amused to see visuals of the External Affairs Minister consulting former senior diplomats with long Pakistan experience, to frame a suitable response including what to do about the announced Foreign Secretary level talks between the two countries for later this month. A policy, if you can call it that, that has been more about knee-jerk reactions and unplanned impromptu gestures can't suddenly be cloaked with the respectability of being a well-considered and thought out one. I've said this before, and at the risk of sounding repetitive, I'll say it again - India-Pakistan relations need stability and consistency, not one-off gestures designed to capture one or two news cycles.
Where do we go from here? There will be loud voices and talking heads calling for a complete disengagement from Pakistan. As far as I'm concerned, that's not the answer because we've done it in the past and it hasn't worked. Instead of routine Foreign Secretary talks, it would be more appropriate for the National Security Advisers of the two countries to meet (away from the media glare again this time), to discuss terrorism and specifically how India would like to see Pakistan respond to this latest attack. Clear goalposts can be established and progress monitored; progress here will allow a certain amount of confidence to be rebuilt; then, the dialogue about other issues can take off from here.
Can we please have no more grand gestures for the time being? If Nawaz Sharif is flying over India, let's allow him to continue his journey uninterrupted and resist the temptation to invite him to drop in for a cup of tea and a fireside chat. Let's take the talks out of the limelight and let things continue, preferably at a level and tempo that can withstand attacks like Pathankot or the one in Mazar-i-Sharif.
Â 
As for lessons learnt, sadly we seem to be doomed to being forced to accept that we've learnt nothing. How can a response, after we had solid intelligence about the presence of armed terrorists, that stretches over three days and costs seven valuable lives and many more injuries not be termed anything other than a grave failure? I've seen some people suggest that because the casualty figure was nowhere near Mumbai's 26/11 death toll, this operation in Pathankot has been a success. If the argument wasn't ridiculous in the extreme, it may have actually been funny. We still treat our security personnel as cannon fodder - poorly-armed and poorly-trained. We lost a Lieutenant Colonel of the NSG during a bomb/IED disposal which is unacceptable! We send injured personnel to hospital in a private vehicle rather than a critical care ambulance, and yet every VVIP worth their salt has at least one such ambulance in their motorcades at all times. Why? I saw any number of images of personnel with no bulletproof gear what so ever. These are all things that have been pointed out in the past and nothing has changed.
How I wish this is the last such blog post I'll have to write, but unfortunately, with all the optimism in the world, I don't believe that to be true - and the next time around, I'll still be lamenting the lessons we refuse to learn.(Omar Abdullah is National Conference leader and former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Are you seriously worried about 60 hours or indirectly  trying to crticise Indian army and its efforts to capture remaining terrorist alive?? Let me tell you, country is more worried about the past 60 years for keeping the special status to J&amp;K that breeds terrorists and is basically root cause of all terrorist problems in India. It's time to stop giving you guys special treatment. FYI abducting government officials isn't new in India, there are countless example of DMs, SPs, getting killed or abducted in UP Bihar Bengal J&amp;K chattishgarh for various reasons.

                            Dear Omar <br/>
This is the first time THAT , I am bothering to write a comment on something written by a politician. Your write is crisp and is addressing / answering most of what is on my mind . Finally the sad fact - that you will probably be writing again on similar lines , on a another fiasco planned in Pak and conducted by the half breeds. Screwed up by the Indian establishment . <br/><br/>
My point - NSAs should meet and tangible action taken . The govt of the day , must make it public ( atleast partially ) what has been done . To be honest - I have lost faith in all political parties , but the handling of this particular crisis , by the BJP , has probably been the worst, that I can remember. I actually voted for Modi , but he has been nothing but a disappointment . This case being the icing on his failure cake  .

                            Disturbingly sad but true. Sometimes I feel we Indians lack a sense of nationalism. Media says soldier were KILLED, Home Minister prematurely says operation has ended, our PM is giving Yoga lecture at a time of national crisis, punjab police takes threats like it's a household dispute, defence personnel don't have adequate gear not even a well equipped ambulance. And now people who had no contribution in country's growth whatsoever will start giving their expert opinions and giving it a political colour whereby the real issue will be lost. Instead of questioning govt for there failure, making them accountable, people will say OH CONGRESS IS BETTER. And in the process we ourself become the people we despise most i.e 'Politicians'. We start defending political parties despite their failures and start supporting opposition party, who are in the opposition because of their failures in the first place. This is the true face of our nationalism.

                            I agree with Omar. But calling terrorist as enemies of humanity is not correct. Also continuing talks in spite of attacks is encouraging these cowardly acts. Sometimes I feel our PM is doing this to get the attention of the world as a peacenik and aim for the nobel peace prize. There is nothing wrong to it but it should not be at the cost of the nation

In a country where PK makes more money than Baby, I don't have much hope. They will listen to Indi-Pakistan singing reality shows and Pakistani bands and forget national security.

                            There are some advantages of being perceived as a 'nationalist' party. Even utter failures on the security front will be forgiven because no one doubts the 'intentions' of the party. From Kandahar to Kargil to Gurdaspur to Pathankot, this govt and the party (BJP) can get away with utter incompetence because of its perception in the minds of people as a 'nationalist' party. If the same thing had happened when some other party was in power, a big hue and cry would have been raised.

                            Bro, you did not even wait 5 mins to criticize modi when the incident started. Your tweet regarding Modi policy with Pakistan came too soon as if you were eager for such thing to happen. Sometimes you should be sensitive to the situation and hold your criticism for latter.

                            Omar Abdullah needs to be complimented for his objectivity and forthrightness in his analysis. A government , which came to power mouthing its hackneyed shibboleths , has been virtually caught napping in the Pathankot attack during which the a much prided defence asset at the border has been attacked by terrorists

                            I only have couple of questions for Omar for jumping the gun first....<br/><br/>
What lessons have you learnt in your regime in J&amp;K with repeated violent incidents? <br/>
The answer is, simple, before you learnt your lesson from past incident, another new incident will be in works across the border about to hit us. They keep happening irrespective of what we do on our side as long as the terrorists get support from other side. As Mr. Doval put it, as long as we are in defensive mode, we must face this, but are we going to shift gears now? no idea.... let's see what Mr.Doval does.<br/><br/>
Regarding your point on Mr.Modi talking about Yoga, what's wrong in that? If the event is on schedule and it is about Yoga, what else should he be speaking? And i also want to ask you, what have you done on that day? Were you on a fast? Please don't raise silly things that have nothing to offer whatsoever to the cause.

                            Kashmir lies at the heart of all our disputes with Pakistan. The solution lies in abrogation of article 370 of the constitution and integrating the state tightly within India. That has to be the final solution. Till then we will face the bane of cross border terrorism and bloodshed. Pakistan will continue to harbor dreams of annexing Kashmir till that issue is firmly dealt with. Omar may not like it, but he is a part of the problem. Unless all politicians decide to merge Kashmir fully into India, the situation will not improve.

                            Omar, Yaar ek tu hee hai jisko sab pata hai, be it, national security, running a country, running a state, international policy. Ek problem hai, you are only whining and complaining in your blog but don't have a tangible constructive solution or suggestion. The government has already shared leads with Pakistan and pushing them to investigate into this further. How about you trying this? Call PMO's office, setup an appointment with PM Modi, discuss with him a concrete plan to resolve this issue. Offer yourself to be a negotiator / track 2 / track 3 diplomat if needed show then nation how it's done. It is all easy to sit in cozy arm chair and comment. How I wish this is the last time you will whine, but unfortunately, with all the optimism in the world, I don't believe that to be true - and the next time around, you will continue to whine and politicize everything as much as possible.

                            It is very true that India has not learned any lesson at all when dealing with Pakistan. It is well understood that Pakis do not wish to see India prosper and be at peace. Sometimes they may talk about being friendly but are really trying to fool Indian politicians. Pakistan will always be the thorn in India's chest. Now it is for our Army, National and State Intelligence agencies and counter terrorism agency to be on look out for such events and nip them in the bud ASAP. There should be no hesitancy as to the opinion of the world when they take strong and befitting measures against the enemies of the country. Jai Jawan and Jai Hind.

                            there are millions of peace loving muslims in India and all around the world. There are very few very radical muslim leaders who peddle their muslim agenda in the name of religion or country - not for the benefit of their people but only for political power. The methods they use are not welcome in the civilized world. These few muslims are the reason muslims in general are being hated in all parts of the planet. The peace loving muslims have to deal with their radical counterpart because they suffer the most. Now Omar sir ji, what can you do to deal with the radical terrorists. What is your recourse?

Firstly it was officials mistake who gave non verified information to home minister, and he commented that mission is over, then it was media mistake which started publishing that operation might be over and started debating over it. And your comments must have been more appreciated if it had come while your coalition was in power, and after every attack on our sovereign politicians start doing petty politics which give negative impact to our armed forces and hurt more than these attacks. It's not that our armed forces are not that capable but there is strategic lag in our forces which was clearly seen in this attack. Please I urge to all not do start blame game on this national issue, we need reforms not blame games.

                            You are known for traitorous activities by talking on principles, acting with interest sitting in London, drinking German beer, eating Dannesh cow. Shameless who has ruled the state with father for N years with no progress

                            This piece from the ex CM of a troubled state begs the question about his contribution to national security when in power. Not to mention blogging about secularism after being the CM of a state that has ethnically cleansed its minorities, Was anything done to bring those people back?

                            Absolutely right. Glad you said WE for a change and not just MODI or BJP like Congress or Shiv Senator etc. Yes sir, WE have not learnt any lessons anywhere on any of the national issues in the last 67 years.     By the way, since you have raised the issue, have we learnt any lesson in Kashmir so far. Or have you taught any to the confused people there.

                            I truly can not agree more with what the National Conference leader, Mr. Omar Abdullah,has suggested by way of a very balanced and thoughtful response. Mr. Abdullah is absolutely correct that,"We still treat our security personnel as cannon fodder". I myself was utterly shocked to see one of the pictures released by ANI during the Pathankot operations. On the 3rd of January,I myself have noticed the picture,which clearly attested how injured personnel were being taken to the hospital in a private car rather than a critical care ambulance. Its high time one must ask why that happened, since the operation at Pathankot was well underway for more than 24 hours at that point of time? When Mr. Modi was busy delivering his sermons on Yoga, very disturbing images of personnel with no bulletproof gear whatsoever where actually making a round. Omar Saheb is right, "These are all things that have been pointed out in the past and nothing has changed." But,there is no reason why the Modi government should not be questioned or the accountability must not be sought? I feel its time we must ask for an explanation!

                            what worries me more is the immaturity of many ministers in this government. This is not the first occasion when ministers are rushing to take accolades. <br/>
I tend to believe that the intentions of the Modi government is to take strong steps against terrorism, but the feeling I get is they are trying to achieve too much in too short a time, too much of chest thumping which is letting them down.<br/>
Many ministers in council of ministers of this government do not have prior experience of governing either at state or at central level.<br/>
Hope things settle down fast and government is able to concentrate on economic growth

                            Some politicians like him one side  will criticize government and the other side  will support terrorism.... Their aim is only to keep themselves in lime light without real sincere feeling for the indian army .... Pakistan will disintegrate with in a short time as they cannot contain for long the groups and counter groups of terrorists, army , mafias and drug peddlers ... BJP goverment should gradually close on their strategy of normalising relation with Pakistan , as Nawas is helpless with the army and terrorists there... There should be hot pursuit of terrorist till all their weaponary and war waging mechanism is smashed ... Better Modiji thinks less of pakistan , as that country is a terrorist country and it can never stop hating India due to Religious feeling and since INdian hatred is the money making mechanism for them.... We could learn lessons from Israel , how they are containing terrorism and how they are managing the terrorism making the terrorists fight each other

                            All these problems of cross border terrorism, communal disharmony in J&amp;K, supporting separatists were created by congress and NC (your party). Now dont try to blame the security forces or BSF. You were advising to remove AFSPA from J&amp;K so that it will be completely handed over to separatists.  You have also never taken any step to bring back pandits in srinagar instead you blocked sankara temple in srinagar from people visiting because you wanted to do walking every day when you were CM.  Proclaim this is not true and proclaim that you family is not in favour of separatists.

                            This is a distraught nations' lament. We lost brave commando on Indian soil within confines of Air Force base, how is this possible with prior intelligence, a careless attitude by authority led to loss of lives. Yogi bear's attitude was nothing short to the one g bush on hearing news of twin towers collapse. This is a national shame and a disaster.

                            Unlike you and your cynical mind we don't have lot of questions. Our security forces has responded well and aborted their operations , and having some casualties and sacrifices are normal in such operations. Pls don't try to politicise this and demotivated me out brace forces

                            Why so much negativity whenever he writes a piece.Coming from a former CM of a troubled state,a level of maturity is expected from him.Now is the time for offering suggestions on how to go forward with peace talks in this kind of awkward situation.Taunting opponents is not a sign of maturity

                            Call off talks with pak. It is the least we can do. I suggest something like what Saudis did to Iran. Complete cancellation of diplomacy.
