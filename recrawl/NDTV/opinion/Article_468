Headline::::Modi's Overtures To Israel Are Deeply Dangerous



DateTime::::2015-03-24T03:30:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha)
	An election in distant Israel would not normally warrant a column on ndtv.com. But last week's surprise victory of Benjamin Netanyahu for a fourth term as Prime Minister has such sinister implications for our domestic national identity, and our foreign and defence policy, that we must evaluate the outcome for its implications for us.
	Compared to India, Israel is a tiny country of some six million people (of whom 1.7 million are Israeli Arabs), as is its neighbour, Palestine, with about 4 million in the West Bank and nearly 2 million in Gaza. But because we were deeply involved, as a member of two key UN committees, with the end of the British mandate in Palestine (which happened in the same year that we secured our Independence), the Israel story came to be closely linked to the India story. In India, the price we had to pay for Independence was Partition. We were, therefore, wary of endorsing the idea of partitioning Palestine to bring the Israeli state into existence. Nehru suggested a "One-State" solution - that the British should leave behind a composite, secular nation comprising both Arabs and Jews who would frame a federal constitution under which one part would have a Jewish majority and the other an Arab majority, but bound together in a federal state that would be jointly and democratically governed by Jew and Arab together.
	The Jews said no to this because they wanted their own separate homeland; the Arabs said no because they saw no reason to pay the price of losing their homeland for a genocide committed not by them but by European Christians during the Second World War. Initially, there was a majority in the relevant UN committees which argued that partition would only lead to even more and longer-lasting problems. Eventually, however, the US and the Soviet Union persuaded or pressurized an overwhelming majority of the international community to vote in favour of partition. India was the only non-Arab, non-Muslim member to stand out against partition.
	The November 1947 partition of Palestine led to a brief war in April-May 1948 during which the Arab armies were roundly defeated by the US-armed and Western-backed Zionists seeking a separate State of Israel, and the Palestinian Arab population was largely driven like cattle from their villages to become a rootless diaspora. That disaster is known to all Palestinians and Arabs as Al-Naqba ('The Catastrophe').
	There have been other wars since, but the present international position favours a "Two-State" solution which guarantees Israel's continued existence but adds  that there must also be an independent, sovereign Palestine state in the territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 war on the West Bank of the Jordan river and the Gaza strip in the Sinai peninsula.
	In the run-up to last week's election, which Benjamin Netanyahu seemed to be on the verge of losing, he suddenly turned around to assert that he would not allow the Palestinians to have a State of their own, and would continue to encourage Jewish settlements on Palestinian territory to preclude the emergence of an integrated Palestinian State. He also denounced the Arab citizens of Israel, who make up about 15% of Israel's electorate, warning the Jews to come out to vote for him to defeat the Arab fifth column in their midst. That is how, by appealing to the basest fears of the Jewish voter, he suddenly came up from behind.
	All this is relevant to us because Israel has emerged as Modi's favourite friend in West Asia in contradistinction to the Arabs, stretching from Oman to Morocco, whom Nehru had cultivated as the Arab bulwark of the Nonaligned Movement, thereby thwarting Pakistan's attempts to play the Islamic card against us. In more practical terms, it is the Arabs, not the Israelis who are hosting seven million Indian expatriate workers who constitute our largest single source of remittances in foreign exchange. India's consistent pro-Arab policy has been a principal cause of the warm welcome our workers have enjoyed. In trade too, Arab destinations like Dubai have emerged as principal outlets for Indian exports. Our stakes in the Arab world are high.
	On the other hand, Israel is the largest supplier now of India's defence requirements. The security cordon has drawn us closer and closer over the years to an Israel whose domestic policies are repugnant to much of what we have stood for all these years, and been diametrically the opposite of our own approach to inclusivist nation-building in diversity. Much of the Israeli attitude to its Arab minorities and Arab neighbours has been anathema to generations of Indian, particularly since Gandhiji in 1938 proclaimed, "Palestine belongs to the Arabs as France belongs to the French and England to the English." This principled stand has now been distorted by being viewed through the prism of defence cooperation. More disturbingly, the Israeli attitude to Muslims and Islam reflects Hindu extremist views in India. Both the Israeli Jewish mainstream and the Indian fringe believe in religion-based nationhood, with Zionism sharing many of the characteristics and prejudices of the Hindutva brigade. That is what has led Modi to send his felicitations to Netanyahu in Hebrew, the Israel language, as a special gushing gesture of delight at extreme views having catapulted Netanyahu to his last-minute win.
	My mind goes back to the only visit I have made to Palestine - in 1998 to join the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Al-Naqba. I was taken to the home of a Hamas leader, then locked in political battle with Yasser Arafat's party. After he told the amusing story of Arafat having asked him to bring out his cadres for the commemoration, to which the Hamas leader had replied that he could not because Arafat had locked them all up, I more seriously enquired how he could imagine that the Arabs would ever prevail. Pat came his answer, "We are making Palestine in our bedrooms!" He went on to explain that the Arab population of Israel was expanding so much faster than that of the Jews, principally because there was  so much net Jewish emigration out of Israel to the glorious West that by the middle of the 21st century, Israel's Arabs would outnumber the Jews. I thought it another joke, but Netanyahu seems to have taken seriously the possibility of the Israeli Arab vote becoming the determining element in Israeli elections. That is a demographic trend that cannot be reversed so long as so many young Jewish citizens of Israel wish to seek their fortunes outside Israel, thus belying the Zionist argument that a Jewish homeland on Palestinian territory is a necessity that justifies any amount of discrimination against its own non-Jewish citizens, and any amount of aggression against its Palestinian neighbours.
	Secular India should not be joining Modi in extending felicitations to the fourth-time Israeli Prime Minister, but in expressing our solidarity with Arabs everywhere in the tragedy of Netanyahu that has now overtaken them - a veritable second Al-Naqba.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

Congress' desire for Arab appeasement is more to do with domestic vote bank politics than anything else. Let our interests guide our policy.

                            Mister : why do we - as an independent nation - need to take a side ? Let's use good relations with both sides in our advantage. Isn't that more pragmatic approach ? <br/><br/>
Secondly, do you know that, what Arabs are doing in Israel - outnumbering Jews - the same is being done by muslims in India? In 1950, Muslims were 9.92 %. In 2011, Muslims are 14.2%. Don't you think it is alarming ? Hindu popolation % is reaching to 80, which was close to 90% at the time of partition. What is your take on this?

                            Here goes this arrogant fool again with his unsolicited (except by NDTV) opinions which most of the time invites only scorn, ridicule and I am sure many unprintable comments!<br/>
I think he (and his Party) should make their minds as to what they want, because if Modi talks to Pakistan, it is treachery, if you speak to China it is sell out/surrender, if you speak to Sri Lanka it is betrayal of Tamils, if you talk to the US, then you are a lackey of Uncle Sam. Basically, what this fool is saying is, that only what he (he is an ex-MEA remember?) says or thinks is the only solution to all of India's problems/issues with its neighbors and the globe. Very Often he arrogantly boasts that he is what he is and will say what he wishes. Fair enough. He should also realize his same rule applies to others too, they also have the right say exactly what they think of MSA, and that is- he is the DEVIL's most unkind gift to India!

                            Well Indians are always known as a lot which causes the downfall of their own kind. Mr. Aiyar has proven himself to be the Grade A of the specimen. Secular India, dear friend is led by corrupt officials at state, district and national levels. Farmers, students, commuter and now even IAS officers are their victims. That is the Al-Nakhba that they face on a daily basis. Illegal sand mining in Tamil Nadu has decimated the livelihoods of many farmers via falling water tables. Villagers that complain to police are baffled to see inaction and in some cases even threatened. Local newspapers carry these reports. Issues like these need the attention of politicians like you. So stop hurting our interests in Arab countries by inciting hatred against a PM that is merely doing his job, every country needs to build relationships, economic and diplomatic and that's what the PM's doing. Did India sever ties with Indonesia over West Papua/Irian Jaya? Did India sever ties with Sri Lanka over Eelam issue? What about Turkey vis-a-vis Northern Cyprus? When every country has the liberty to have ties with any country irrespective of its own problem why can't India?

                            Mani, you have to stop viewing world as envisaged by Nehru. We have very hostile neighbours like Israel and we need their weaponry and clout with US to tackle our problems. It may be an injustice to Arabs but we have to be practical to secure out future. That should drive our foreign policy

                            Mr Aiyar in his eagerness to defame the PM has ignored the fact that the Arabs have neither ever openly and severely criticized the Pakistani national policy of using terrorists as an instrument of state policy to foment terror in India. He has conveniently glossed over the fact that the Arabs have never asked Pakistan to return PoK or criticized Pakistan over Kargil. He has obviously forgotten the often dgrading conditions in which Indians, specially Hindus, have to work in Saudi Arabia. He has ignored the fact that Indians are forced to give up their passports to their employers in the Arab countries where they go to work, but not so in Israel. So much for Congressi secularism!!

I think in the recent times you have written a sensible column that makes a little sense to the readers. But , you are trying to portray only Namo is establishing a new relation with Israel, contrary to the fact that  business relation with Israel was strong during congress region at the same time giving support for PLA also.<br/><br/>
It is evident from the fact that in the last decade Israel business partners on the value/volume of business are USA, India and Jordan . Interestingly the neighbor of Israel Jordan is an Arab country having good business relation with them  but politically having a different approach . <br/><br/>
Therefore, your comment does not make any great sense other than  spewing another dose of venom against Namo.

                            We should stay out of Palestine-Israel troubles. Period! <br/><br/>
The Arabs have supported Pakistan in all our wars. Even Nehru's so called best friend Nasser of Egypt supplied Pakistan with ammunition and aircraft in the war. So much for Congress' international policy. <br/><br/>
We need Israel's technology and weapons as it reduces our complete dependence on Russian exports --- which are obsolete and growing unreliable every year. <br/><br/>
Plaestine-Israel problem is not our headache. I think it was wrong on our part to take sides. Sorry Mr. Iyer, I don't believe our policy of Arab appeasement is correct. Even Arabs today have deserted Palestine. As per you visiting Hamas and praising them, I am not surprised. Only a Congress man will praise a terrorist.

Pray Mr Aiyar...what did all the "Islamic" countries do to prevent Pakistan from fostering terror in India for decades now?

On the contrary, Israel has stood with us and it is plain stupidity on our part not to officially recognize this all along.

                            What has India achieved by supporting the Arab countries? Have they ever supported us against Pakistan? No. It is Israel which has unstintingly supported us in our war against terrorism. We need to forge stronger ties with Israel rather than other Arab countries which turn a blind eye to terrorism. No matter how much India hob-nobs and tries to please them they side with Pak because they share the same religion. This is a cold hard fact and a senile Mani should recognize this. At least the rest of the country has woken up to this fact after 60 years.

He was greeting the Pakis with more joy and love which we never saw him do to his own countrymen of other party BJP!

                            By that logic the Arab world must not cooperate with Pakistan because of India's deep-seated animosity with her. Islamic countries have found a not so secular - oic organization of islamic cooperation because of their mutual animosity against Israel and the Arab oil embargo that the OPEC countries adopted was a sheer sign of blackmail . India is a secular country and we don't have any issue with Israel and all Israelis are like our brothers and sisters just like muslims . Tell me a single instance when the Arab world backed India instead of Pakistan ? <br/>
India is a pluralistic and a free society unlike the Arab world and the sheikhdoms with their extractive political and economic institutions  . <br/>
I know Mr. Aiyar you Despise Modi but AApkey din toh ab gaye . haha.

                            Mr. Aiyar, <br/>
Just my 2 cents:<br/><br/>
1) Despite India showing solidarity and standing up for the cause of Palestine, the Arab world has for the major part not shied away from funding terrorists and supporting Pakistan on Kashmir issue. <br/><br/>
2) India needs high technology weapons and the know-how to make/operate them in this scenario of ever increasing friction with China.<br/><br/>
3) I am not sure if this is true or not but I heard Israel was one of the few countries to supply weapons and intelligence to India during the Kargil war without any questions asked or conditions attached.<br/><br/>
4) The hon. Prime minister Nehru that you hold so high in esteem has never condemned human rights violations in Arab countries as far as I know.<br/><br/>
5) In this ever changing multi-polar world, closer ties with one nation does not necessarily mean India does not support or is against another. <br/><br/>
India must do what it needs to survive and take whatever opportunity arises. Also Israel has been at the forefront of intelligence and cyber security in which India still lacks the cutting edge. will closer ties with Israel not help India in these matters? <br/><br/>
You accuse Modi of doing no right and say congress PMs to be bathed in white milk..if you are so concerned, why did PM Singh make a pact with the US who invaded Iraq without any proof of WMDs and many innocent people were killed during the bombings? Did your "secular" conscience at that time not tell you to oppose the deal? Why did India continue to support Russia and remain its ally even though Russia is known to have a dictatorial and authoritative government? In all cases, India gained from those diplomatic relations and when this government does the same you mock them? I can understand your zeal in proving yourself a man of complete faith in Congress and Nehruvian idealogies but please do be rational. Do think as an Indian first and weigh the positives as well.

                            I fail to recollect if ever this author (this is all he will ever be now) has ever written a single blog or article with a positive frame of mind. All he cares is about "secularism" in the congress way and throw dirt on the rest. This man is an example of muslim appeasing secularism that this country has witnessed for far too long. Learn something about secularism from USA. Having said all this, I am no Modi fan. He is plain and simple anti-muslim and leading a liar &amp; disgusting party that promised moon and stars for the common man like us before the election, but is continuing to fill the coffers of the one funding their election campaigns. I have no hope remaining as far as the politicians in this country are concerned. NDTV should disallow people with known political alignments from writing blogs on their website. If at all they feel the need to spit the venom, they should be doing it on their party websites or the public blog sites.<br/><br/>
God help us!

                            Congress party should sack this man immediately before he does more damage to the party &amp; and the country by being pro-Arabs and pro-Pakistan and pro-Terrorists. This man is not realizing why congress lost in last elections. you have spoiled the country by not acting on terrorism. you said "Shaanthi Shaanthi" in one of your blog. That "Shaanthi" word has become an enemy of Hindhus. Because of "Shaanthi" the last king of Hindhu India (Bharat) was defeated by Gajini Mohammad Ghori. Until then this country was a pure Hindhu country. Manishankar Aiyar, you should join a mental hospital immediately. Your idealogy is very dangerous to the country.

                            After decades listening to politicians quoting Gandhi to rally support for their own agendas, i have made it a personal rule to disagree with anyone who refers to Gandhi as the bible for india. It was Gandhi who taught Indians the art of shameless emotional blackmail.<br/>
The man was full of contradictions and hypocrisies.<br/>
Nehru was a worse misfit.

                            I'm not usually a fan of Mani Shankar Iyer but on this one I think he has it right. Netanyahu is viewed even by the US govt as being a warmonger who has his racist policies against Palestinians and who is not interested in peace or in a two state solution. We should buy Israeli weapons etc, but not get too close politically.

Modi has moved far far ahead of these leftist and left a big gap they can never fill. India's interest will be better served by Modi than by arrogant leftists.

                            Mani, thorough your article, you have conveyed the apprehensions of the minority community in India. This is very relevant of late in the backdrop of the growing intolerance amongst the fringe Hindutva outfits against the minorities in India, which looks very similar to the intolerance and oppression meted out to the Palestinians by the Zionists. Therefore, 'special gestures' by the PM towards Israel is indeed worrisome. We sincerely hope that our Government works towards the progress and development of India and views India-Israel relationship purely from this perspective and is not picking up anti-minority tactics from Israel.

Also, your remarkable lack of intellectual clarity is only matched by senile, unremarkable high-sounding nothings.  <br/>
India's soft power is on full display today and the extent of foreign affair progress in less than a year is astounding... in country after country after country.<br/>
Hearing you.. I think the Nations of the World missed a trick... I think you have the Palestine problem and surely the solution as well nailed!   10 second view of Israel and Palestine history and somehow trying to make Nehru relevant was a neat touch.  Finally.. what was the point of this article? India engages with Nations on her terms.  Does engaging with any one nation = inimical relations with all nations that are not on good terms with that nation? Wah.. no wonder Congas was isolated and irrelevant in foreign affairs.
