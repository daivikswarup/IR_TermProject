Headline::::The Dangers of an Ex RAW Chief's Tell-All



DateTime::::2015-07-06T04:17:00+05:30




                                For the last few days, mainstream media and social media alike have been abuzz discussing the hitherto unacknowledged aspects of the role of Indian intelligence agencies in Kashmir. What was commonly whispered and gossiped about in the Valley was suddenly brought front and centre after a series of interviews by AS Dulat, the former RAW chief. These interviews by Dulat are part of the circuit all authors go on to drum up interest in their forthcoming publications, in this case, Dulat's book - Kashmir: The Vajpayee Years.
I'll start with a caveat, this piece is not a review of Dulat and Aditya Sinha's (who is credited as a co-author) work. I haven't read the book yet, and thus all I'm basing this on is what I've read or seen of the interviews. I'm not going to comment about the more gossipy parts of the book detailing some of the name-calling or suspicions about fellow mainstream politicians. It's also not a reaction to the parts of the book that mention me or my father. As far as I'm concerned, this is a recollection of events from the author's perspective and any inaccuracies I'll just put down to artistic license.
My problem with the book is a far more fundamental one. My objection to the book starts and ends with only a two-part question - should the book have been written in the first place, and having been written, should it not have been subjected to some sort of vetting to make sure it doesn't compromise any ongoing or possible future operations? These questions are based on what I know of similar situations in other countries.(Cover of former RAW chief AS Dulat's book - Kashmir: The Vajpayee Years)Take the UK, for example - when the former head of MI5 wanted to release her memoir 'A Life of Surprises' in 2000/01, it had to be submitted for vetting and was only published in censored form; any passage considered damaging to national security was omitted. A highly-placed source in MI5 at the time told The Telegraph that her action represented a "moral betrayal" of her colleagues.
 
That Mr Dulat has been a witness to a lot of Kashmir's recent history cannot be called in to question. He served in Kashmir as Joint Director Intelligence Bureau during the critical period 1988 to 1990 which coincides with the time militancy took root in the Valley. He then moved to the Kashmir Operations desk in the IB headquarters. He only moved away from this desk when he was promoted to Special Director IB, and having retired from this post, he made the rare transition from the IB to the Research and Analysis Wing as its chief. He was appointed to the PMO during PM Vajpayee's tenure to advise on Kashmir in 2001, and this term ended in 2004. I'm mentioning all this just to underline the point that he has been in the thick of things through the most turbulent period in the state's history.
 
Let's look at some of the incidents that Dulat has talked about in his book and the implications that these could have for the future. Take the Syed Salahudin one for starters. The book details how an attempt was being made to bring back the leader of the UJC, The United Jehad Council, at the behest of the IB. The IB, according to Dulat, was in touch with the chief of the Hizbul Mujahideen to try and get him to return to India from POK. During the course of this attempt, Salahuddin is reported to have contacted the then head of the IB in Srinagar to help his son gain admission to a Government Medical College. The IB got in touch with the then Chief Minister, my father, and this admission was arranged. Now I'm not getting in to the debate as to whether a militant leader's son should have been assisted in this way or not, but ask yourself this: have we not closed our doors to any sort of covert contact with Salahuddin for all times to come? This contact may not seem necessary or important now, but can we rule out its utility completely?
 
Similar is the fallout of the detailing of contact between the IB/Dulat and some of the senior Hurriyat leaders. That there has been back-channel contact between some of these leaders and the Government of India is widely whispered about but seldom, if ever, acknowledged. It is back-channel contact that is often developed to the point where it starts to yield results. These results sometimes, though not always, result in the sort of photo opportunity that the authors have used on the cover of the book. For those who haven't seen the cover, it shows Vajpayee sahib meeting senior leaders of the APHC in Race Course Road. This meeting didn't just happen on the spur of the moment; it took time, effort and a series of back-channel discussions to arrive at this point. Once again, I'm forced to ask which separatist leader will now talk to people like Dulat only to have this contact detailed in a book a few years down the line. If the IB did pay for medical treatment or travel arrangements for separatist leaders, it was done as an ongoing operation to develop a rapport with them, a rapport that will now be even more difficult to establish.
 
It's clear that the only solution to the Kashmir problem will emerge out of a sustained dialogue with all the stake holders, and those stake holders include some of the people exposed by this book. It's also as clear as day that not all this contact can be in the public domain from Day One itself. Some of the initial contact will have to be behind the scenes. It's going to be a major challenge for the intelligence agencies, the IB in particular, to rebuild any confidence that covert contact will remain just that. As someone in the IB remarked to a journalist friend after the first interview - "Who will trust us enough to talk to us now?"
 
That's the reason I'm asking if this book or books like this should not be vetted, if at all they are written in the first place.(Omar Abdullah is National Conference leader and former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            The author (Omar) is absolutely right! Should retired Heads of external and internal Intelligence agencies be allowed to write their professional memoirs and have them published without the government in power vetting the same? Nobody will have any objection if the former Intel chief had written a book on 'Bee-keeping' or 'How to lead a retired life'. But to write about a Nation's overt and covert ops? Stupid is the word that comes to my mind. By the way, is he not violating the Official Secrets Act?

                            Great article. Agree with him rarely, but this time he is on the point. But even after agreeing I have to say I have some reservations. Its been 68 years almost of Kashmir conflict with no resolution in sight. How does one review such a secret ministry and its lack of results for 68 years?! Again, 68 years! What the heck is going on? The difference in treatment of Khalistan issue and Kashmir issue, smacks of muslim appeasement. Both BJP and Congress have been party to that sin BTW.

                            It needs incredible will power to stay away from being in limelight or one has to be extremly mature and smart to keep publicity at a bay. All these ex chief are aware of trump card they can use hence have no qualm at all to get best out of it. Biggest fear is looming that soon there would be a division between officers during BJP v/s Congress. They would create havoc and media will surely enjoy huge TRP. India is in deeper problem than we regular folks realise.

                            Mr Dulat has shown extreme irresponsibility perhaps out of greed for publicity but the blame should be applied in equal measure on certain news channels as well. Have these Channels learnt nothing from the their TRP greed induced fiasco while reporting the 26/11 incidents ? Many trapped victims actually died due to the immature and selfish handling of reporting by these channels.

                            Hi Omar,<br/>
Understand your thoughts and your dilemma for the future.<br/>
But I wishfully do not agree with your views.<br/>
(1)Yes, UK may have vetted a book written by intelligence people. But I want to take the example of USA where, CIA chiefs after their retirement write books detailing these kind of covert operations and details.<br/>
(2)I am a strong believer of openness in democracy. Only open-ness will win in the long run.<br/>
(3)After certain years of retirement, say 5 or 10 years, most of the details of an intelligence chief's experiences should come out<br/>
(4)I also do not think that no separatist leader will hitherto believe the IB and won't co-operate. I believe Politicians/Separatists even terrorists will take the pain / move on / do the same back channel talks for their / state's wellbeing as they see fit. This is how humans operate.<br/>
(5)Finally, I do not think that because of this expose, Kashmir problem will / will not be solved. The solving of Kashmir problem will have no relevance with these types of books. It will depend on other factors which we are all aware. (Militancy / Cross border support / Tiredness of majority people of bad life style / Political will power etc..)

                            we cannot take eveything as face value. All we know is that this might be a controversy created to promote sales of any new upcoming book by Mr. X RAW agent. So its stupid to just assume that whatever he says is 100% truth.

                            1. Sometimes the soltuion lies in being silent rather than speaking the truth, be it a democratic country. so what?<br/><br/>
Not evreything should come in public view, in order to maintain peace and harmony.<br/><br/>
2. What is the point in working secretely as part of an IB/RAW like organization only to vomit the facts out after retirement?<br/>
It is like a lawmaker/policeman/armyman or any individual turning against their oath once the service is completed. <br/>
This act lacks the dignity and maturity.<br/><br/>
The book should be vetted by the goverment in full support by media &amp; citizens.

                            Back-channel talks are always on, in any organization and at much higher level like IB Director in this case. Exposing/admitting it a stupid thing to do by an existing or ex-Director. Shame on him doing so just for publicity (so it appears). Omar has a point, who will now talk to us?!

                            Well written article, and good points raised by Omar. Dulat took an oath / signed papers of confidentiality when he joined R&amp;AW, and if he didn't get the Govt's permission to publish this book, he should be taken to court. When you join any company and sign papers of confidentiality, the requirement continues to hold even after you leave that company. You cannot disclose their secrets ten years later. Now why didn't Omar recommend that?

                            Omer Abdullah's piece,(though obviously written for him by some sidekick) is the sort of spiel ensuing from the mouths of those caught with their pants at their ankles.<br/>
As to his rhetorical question: "I'm forced to ask which separatist leader will now talk to people like Dulat only to have this contact detailed in a book a few years down the line." - They all will, when the time comes for them to, and each of them will do so at his own volition. They are mercenaries after all, and when the price is right they'll jump whichever way they have to. Any doubt about that, Mr. Abdullah?<br/>
The Kashmir "separatists" have been having it good for donkey's years. Its time for them to feel the heat.<br/>
Well done, Dulat. Turn the screw a worm more.

                            Daulat has compromised the country on a lot of fronts. He has violated the sensitivity of the confidence that an IB chief or any IB member enjoys. He has raised doubts as to the legitimacy of the official secrets act. Daulat has proved that he was undeserving of the faith reposed in him by the then government which acted in faith. Daulat may earn some money with his book but he will always remain in public memory as someone who breached their trust.

                            All intelligence chiefs should write their memoirs. After 2 years of their demitting office, anything they know will be of little operational value. So why not write? Wikileaks has not brought down the US government. What Omar Abdullah really wants to avoid is the double dealing of the political class being exposed. One day inconvenient stories about him may also surface.

                            The way Wikileaks have shown it is better to put things in the open than hide them. Kashmiri leaders both political and separatists have acted as power brokers and they are afraid now that their true colours are visible. As far as IC 814 and such incidents go it is important to learn from past mistakes.

                            The suggestion that one should not be allowed to speak truth as he knows it is really fantastic. And it is easy for people making this suggestion to masquerade as upholders of national interest. I refuse to believe that people on the other side of the fence (read as militants, separatists etc.) do not know that their secret interactions with Indian authorities for seeking mundane favours or for discussing matters of high state will be discussed some day. We are talking about realpolitic which can most often be amoral. It is important that general public know what their leaders are capable of doing when nobody is watching. Let's for argument's sake agree with the writer's doubtful proposition that it will be difficult to make contact with militants because of Dulat's book. Correspondingly will it not be difficult for the militants to inspire Kashmiri people for the cause they (the militants) so passionately profess while making all kinds of self-serving compromises behind the scenes. Which Kashmiri will die for a leader who secretly stoops to pull strings for the sake of a medical seat for his son? Will this not weaken them vis-a-vis Indian state. Every Kashmiri knows that Indian state is hellbent on integrating Kashmir with rest of India. By fair or foul. What Dulat can reveal about Indian state is not going to significantly aggravate that image of India in an average Kashmiri mind. But does an average Kashmiri know what their revered leaders who profess to sacrifice their life for Kashmir, Kashmiris and Kashmiriyat can do on the sly. Mr. Dulat has torn the veil of Kashmiri leaders not of the Indian state.<br/><br/>
Books like these improve our understanding of the affairs of the state and people running them. Of fake freedom fighters and their mundane concerns. And that understanding helps us to consciously cultivate a healthy scepticism about outward appearance of men and matters. Mr. Dulat has done a great service by telling the story he has been part of. Let's hope there will be more truthful books by politicians, bureucrats and spies to make matters of state more accessible to general public.

                            I doubt there is any truth to what this Indian spy is saying. These are simple attempts to deliberately defame Kashmir pro-freedom leadership. If what he said was true, he will never reveal and would not be allowed to reveal those secrets to public. I do not know why very ordinary things seem extraordinary to Indians. Admission to a medical school is a very ordinary thing. Assuming Slahuddin's son was given admission because of Slahudin's request to Indian intelligence chief, what did the Indian intelligence chief get in return. Slahuddin's stand on Kashmir is harder than ever before. His is the only organization flourishing in Kashmir. Had Omar Abdullah refused to support Dualat's claim of Sladhuddin contacting Indian intelligence organization, he would have somewhat repaired the damage that Dualt had done to secret operation (if at all there are any secret negotiations going on). I firmly believe this is simply a gimmick by Indian agents and their puppets to defame ongoing freedom movement in Kashmir.

                            Omar is am extremely sensitive and mature person and his views are very well taken. People occupying sensitive positions should not share information privy to them due their positions for monetary or personal gain.

                            Well this is first time Omar Abdullah has come out with something sensible and worth supporting, Indian Government should cite his concern as this kind of exposes will pose further threat to IB's operations in valley which after long time seems to be improving.

                            It is a good question. There were lot of secrets "For Your eyes only" while you were in the government.  Those who divulge those secrets should not be encouraged, at least one intends to make money out of selling those secrets.

                            I bet if this book would have remotely shown Hindutva in a bad light, the government would have banned it immediately. But, it seems they don't care about national security.

                            Mr. Omar is absolutely right. There should be some code of conduct for Senior officials holding sensitive positions regarding sharing of information which they were privy of because of the position they held.<br/><br/>
Mr. Dulat was RAW chief &amp; he must be having many sensitive information but its not ethical to make them public after retirement.

                            Absolutely logical argument presented. Head of intelligence agency should not be revealing such details so soon after the event. And particularly if there are to be consequences with current situation. The situation is Kashmir has not been resolved!

                            Omar articulated the anguish of a majority of educated Indians. Dulat is a traitor. Merely to earn a few more Rupees, he laid bare the operational details of his former employer.

                            There is no danger. The ex agent was right.<br/>
What the government agencies did was totally unethical and brutal.<br/>
We must not allow our government agencies to carry out false flag attacks and blame another when we know who really did it.<br/>
Ask yourself this.<br/>
What happens if the same agencies carry out false flag attacks against you and your family and blamed your own friends and community?<br/>
It is the same thing.

                            I agree with Mr.Omar. Any person who is in highly sensitive post should not come out and write such books... The government of india should come down heavily on people like this for breach of trust. It looks like he might have violated secrecy clause also.
