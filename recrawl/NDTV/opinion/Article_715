Headline::::Bajrangi Bhaijaan. Will the Real Salman Please Stand Up



DateTime::::2015-07-18T19:23:00+05:30




                                It's me! I have a problem with a goody-goody Salman Khan. I vastly prefer the wildly OTT rascala, ripping off his shirt and spouting risque lines. I buy stereotypes. There. I have confessed. Which is why, after sitting through 159 minutes drowning in malpua syrup, I came home and reached for my Hanuman Chalisa. After reciting it 159 times, I was still not feeling better. I don't suffer from diabetes, or else I would have given myself a hefty shot of insulin just as an additional precaution.Bajrangi Bhaijaan will go on to make several hundred crores. That's a given. The thing is I have a problem with movies that manipulate... Now several movies are guilty of that - but this one has a specific sub-text (let's not go into the details of what that sub-text is - if you follow the news dealing with high-profile criminal cases, you already know the context). And that sub-text dominates the entire movie, reducing it to an ad commercial for a super efficient detergent ("my shirt washes whiter").
So long as viewers don't dodge the real message of BB - and it's not the obvious Indo-Pak bhai-bhai one - the implausible story becomes more palatable. It certainly appears as if the entire team carefully picked a theme that would project Salman Khan as a larger-than-life do-gooder, incapable of telling an untruth, or hurting a fly (unless that fly comes in the way - as in the fight sequence at the brothel). At this point, I said to myself, maybe a special screening can be held for cops and judges dealing with the ongoing, emotionally-charged hit-and-run case. Why not go the whole hog?
Salman playing a simpleton is a grand idea. But this simpleton is played so broadly, there are times one wonders whether it's a send up. The only superbly timed, wickedly funny line in the movie is when when Salman is asked, "Bhaiya, yeh 'selfie' kya hota hai?" and Salman (Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi in the film - but Salman Khan all the way), quips, "Jab khud ki lete hain na...." long pause. Then "... tasveer." This line sums up Brand Salman. And no matter how sincerely and strenuously Kabir Khan, the director, tries to remould the essential Salman into a namby-pamby, devout Hanuman bhakt who bows and prays to every passing monkey (really!!!!), fans wait for the asli Salman to emerge. I did. I was counting the minutes and saying, "Okay... here comes the turning point... this is when Salman will drop that cloying, simpering, irritating sweetness and be himself." I waited in vain.
Since the star is in every frame virtually, we are stuck. But mercifully he has stiff competition from an angelic six-year-old superstar called Harshaali Malhotra, who wordlessly steals the show from Salman. Then, of course, there is Nawazuddin Siddiqui! Now, why didn't Kabir Khan introduce Chand Nawaab much, much earlier? Like I had tweeted, "More Nawaz, less awaaz", would have added a great deal of histrionic oomph to the narrative.
Now to the key question: was I bored out of my skull? Ummm. No. Only in parts, during the first half. These days audiences are grateful if there is even a semblance of a coherent plot and some sort of a story that holds a blockbuster together. We are used to passively watching a string of mindless scenes, and arrogantly calling that mess a movie. BB does have a story - Allah be praised! And it also follows a linear graph, with a conventional beginning, middle and end. Where it flounders, and flounders badly, is when it piles on the cliches. I was pretty astonished by the rather crass caste-ist remarks about 'fair' Brahmins, and meat-eating 'Kshatriyas' who also happen to be 'fair'. Equally, the references to 'Mohammedans' and their food habits were most distasteful.
Whatever the claims about BB being a movie that celebrates love over hate, friendship over enmity, empathy over suspicion (which it indeed does), most Salman Khan bhakts came away worrying about just one question: will his well-timed performance as an ambassador of peace and pyaar keep him out of jail??(Shobhaa De is an established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator, who is considered an authority on popular culture.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            This movie was made to change salman khan image , as salman case is still going in court, thats the truth, in real life if salman wants to become true hero , he should accept the mistake that he has made, he should apologise to all fans , can he do it in real life, only then one can say salman image has really changed.

                            I wonder who reads Shobha's articles, most of us already loathe bollywood and need no more agreement with what is written, and the Bhakths, cops and judges, give two hoots about such articles - what will such information change in society for her as a "journalist"? <br/><br/>
Only Bahubali can teach bollywood a lesson now!

What's next that sallu will do to keep himself out of jail <br/><br/>
A peace movie<br/>
Spend a few crores for missing files <br/>
Or rub his nose and kill the witnesses <br/><br/>
Or just act as Robin Hood <br/><br/>
Give up drinks <br/>
But not the girls <br/><br/>
Or is he part of KJO and Manish Malhotra troupe <br/>
As he puts up his candidates with <br/>

                            Well Shobha, if Sanjay Dutt a.k.a. 'Mr Gandhigiri' is anything to go by, Sallu had better prepare to spend quality time in Arthur Road.  You can, of course visit him and perhaps take him an old copy of 'Stardust' to read.  If you are tech savvy, you can even show him how to download it on to Kindle.  Above all, perhaps you can give him tips on acting.  God knows; the poor fellow needs to learn acting skills as his steroid filled body will fall into disrepair what with his being on the wrong side of 50.

                            GiveA salman the credit for making a wonderful movie. Old lady pls keep your negative thoughts to yourself. So many vyapam n Asaram murders, hems mailini's driver killed a child. Hath dho ke unke peeche pado na. Salman has done so much good n is a changed person. Btw I'm a srk fan but being a human I believe salman has done enough to be forgiven. N don't even get me started on the foolish case of extinct animal killing. Nirbhayas murderers are still not hanged. Surely her life was more valuable than some animal!

                            I do agree with y about him being to sweet and how weird it is to see him like that. But got over it  after like.. 20min or so. I now saw him as Pawan. I no longer  saw him as Salman Khan which he has done for the last 4 years giving us annoying  movies. After 4 years I have seen a movie of his which I  not only like but loved. And would consider his best movie till now. I had zero expectations when I stepped inside the cinema and the movie turned out to be shockingly amazing. Everyone delivered their best, Nawaz as always perfect, but didn't steal the spotlight like he did the last time in Kick. Because the script is undoubtedly much better than Kick, where Salmans role is as good as his. And the little girl was such  a good actor. I was afraid  she would  be a bad one cuz then u kinda get annoyed  with child actors but she really made me cry my heart out. Long  story short. The movie made me cry, laugh, sad and happy. An entertainer with a damn good story. Not like his other movies which he is playing  himself in every movie.

                            With utmost respect to Madam Shobha De,My diagnosis is that She suffer from delusion of GRANDEUR. This commentator  does not consider her a Journalist as she lacks credentials. Yet she comes on so many News panels and frankly I am yet to hear from her any thought provoking commentary. My guess is she has some complex and she just wants to show off.Equally I am concerned as to why NDTV invites so called Journos like her and M. Shankar Aiyar to write their stupid blog.<br/>
Just read the comments for both the above quoted self styled Journos and you will know what I mean.

Chalo aap ke article ke hisab se #Bajrangi Bhaijaan audience ko manipulate karne ke liye banaya gaya hai. uss me salman ke character ko larger-than-life portray kiya gaya hai aap ke point of view se. chalo man leta hu. lekin, mujhe itna batao ki na aap producer ho #BB key, Na Co-Producer ho, Aapka paisa bhi nai laga hai movie me, na aapko kisi ne force kiya movie dekhne ko, then why, you were sitting in theatre for 159 minutes drowning malpua syrup, you would had taken the theatre Exit. Itna Mushkil tha Kya Exit Lena??? Chalo agar exit nahi liya aapne, koi nahi, toh puri movie dekhi hogi aur hanuman ji ki jarur bhakt hongi??? Ho na?? toh aap jhut bhi nahi bolenge?? Itna toh mante ho na ki iss movie ne aapko itna inspire kiya ki aapne 151 times hanuman chalisa padh daala isn,t it great. Aur aapko aisa lagta hai ki iss movie me aapki tarif nahi ki gayi toh koi baat nahi, turn to producer agle movie me tum khud ko ache kaam karte hue dikha diyo i swear me movie jarur dekhunga aur aapke movie ki baat karunga na ki kis liye yeh movie banaya gaya.<br/>

                            Very interestingly worded article trashing the BB movie, actually very entertaining. But I think let's not mix up the movie with the actor's real life and let the judiciary take its action on the case. If you don't like him, don't go watch his movie, or if you want to go, go, but don't go there looking for ways to hate the actor. Get it?

                            Now that media has exhausted all the tricks to bring down salman and they also don't have the usual muck about quality if the film to throw on bajrangi bhaijaan, they have come up with this. There is this new conspiracy theory being propagated by media calling bajrangi bhaijaan a deliberate image building exercise. It is absurd and stupid beyond imagination, but they are doing it. I have read at least four such articles in the past two days. By the way, wasn't salman popular before BB? Did people who love him think any differently about the case, before bajrangi bhaijaan? The answer is, No. Hypocrites!

                            An Open letter to Ms. Shobha De.<br/><br/>
Well, I have been regularly following your blogs with an utter intensity and compassion. Alas! This review doesn't go well with me in regards to the ‚ÄòBajrangi Bhaijaan' review. However, I would like to know, like are you to pick up on the Superstar- ‚ÄòSalman Khan's' character OR tyring to scrutinize every scene of the film to the mass on a passive note. Irony is and can be  as simple as that, this film has been very well accepted by the so called ‚ÄòJanta' and is luckily making a big Hat-trick at the box office segment, not coz of the superstar Salman (He would anyways coz he's loved by me and by the rest in this country) but the reason being, that the storyline says it all! Well if u watched it, u should know that this movie signifies multiple positive meanings to all of us especially the crux of creating a communal love amongst all of us, which unfortunately does falls apart :/ Why should we personalize on someone's character when none of us has the rights to do that! I am sure nor you or me would like it either, if we have been highlighted for no relevance. Well, if u want to bombard on my statement ‚Äòrelevance' lets go with it‚Ä¶how about the rest who have not been highlighted for their sheer mistakes or so called sin and why are the hidden matters been graved instead of getting a justified punishment. Let alone the judiciary system decide on the ‚ÄòHit-n run case' that actually happens on daily basis on our day-to-day life and most of them are on wraps. But poor Salman Khan has been badly washed, how about the rest who have committed a worst case or has the ‚Äòrape tag and hasn't got punished?  Salman khan doesn't needs to portray anything good, we all know how good he is and to him doing a hit movie or not will always have a million fans loving him including me. We should rather thank the director who had the belief in doing such an amazing film unlike the typical non-relevant masala. So let's emphasise on all good things a movie/ director/ or a layman can do‚Ä¶rather than cribbing about something which will not make sense.  Kudos to Kabir Khan for bringing up such amazing movies back-to-back in a row and nevertheless, my childhood superstar- Salman Khan (genuinely a good human being and has helped and is been forever aiming to help everyone out there) for shining more and more high and making each one of us smile and igniting more love for you. Cheers to all.:-)

                            First of all movie was under making before the court judgement / hearing ..just to counter your senseless theme of potraying goody goody on screen which somehow will benefit in court (lol at that) grow up movies and real life are different the actor just plays a part he is given..real life is different hope we are clear on that..and judges dont get influenced by wat he is playing in a movie (hopefuully ffs) <br/><br/>
lastly this article looks like a desperate attempt to put Salman down...well you can try all you want..his movies will keep grossing crores and crores despite such lame pointless critics...

                            Yes,  Shobhaji I too waited for the salman moment which never arrived.  And it's not image change  for the legal angle, its produced by Salman to make hay by working on fan emotion. Legally he is confident that the judiciary is equivalent to his kepts (so called girl friends past and present) dancing to his tunes.  Sadly it happens in India,  a commoner is punished and celebrities and uber rich go scott free.

                            Just wondering - When Shobhaa De claims " ...who is considered an authority on popular culture.", who are these people? Surely pop culture is not the negative, cynical, whiny persona that defines Shobhaa De.

                            Thank god! At least shoba de wrote what I could see thru the push given to paint a goodie goodie picture for Salaman. Movies are not real life. These promotions shouldn't blind the legal process

                            Bravo ShobaDe. Media and public have such a short memory and will donate crores to the regular mediocre film by their celebrity star. Thanks for standing up and reminding folks about this convicted murderer.

                            Just how cynical should one be to draw these conclusions. This review fails the Shobhaa De quality test. Before I am accused, let me clarify I am a Shobhaa De fan not a Salman fan.
