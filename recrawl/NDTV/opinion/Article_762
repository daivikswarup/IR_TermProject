Headline::::How to Read Modi's Independence Day Speech



DateTime::::2015-08-15T18:08:00+05:30




                                Compared speech to speech, this year's August 15 effort by Prime Minister Narendra Modi would take second place to the flourish and fervour at the Red Fort on Independence Day in 2014. It would be easy to call this a disappointing speech, too long and even "boring", all expressions this writer has heard used in the course of the past few hours.
Yet, would such an interpretation be entirely fair? In 2014, Modi was speaking just three months after a pulsating election victory. The fact that he spoke from his heart, free of the stilted delivery and notes of the past 10 years, if not longer, and that he had no legacy to explain or worry about worked to his advantage. It was a blue-sky speech; he could place the stars where he wanted.
A year down the line, the sky is not as clear. It cannot be; inevitably, the clouds will appear. In that sense, this was a more "normal" Prime Ministerial speech. One hesitates to use the word "normal" because frankly one is judging Modi by his own oratorical standards. Both his speeches remain superior to those of not just his immediate predecessor but many Prime Ministers.
To some degree, Modi was addressing the mood of despondency that he said his critics - in which he implicitly included political opponents and media pundits - were creating, and sought to dispel the notion that his government had not done much.  Depending on how one looks at it, this was a defensive or combative move.
It carried forward a bet that Modi had taken during his long pre-election campaign: that he could use television-friendly moments to address his people directly, bypassing the transmission loss and interpolation of the media. Here, too, he was telling his constituency and his citizens that his report card, while it had its shortcomings, was still markedly better than that being portrayed by some sections.
 

Three points stood out in the speech. First, Modi sought to link the rolling back of corruption to not one or two blockbuster initiatives but a longer process - of auctions of public resources (which the Modi government has extended to resources beyond coal, the commodity for which auctions were mandated by the courts); of doing away with subjective job interviews where this is feasible; of bank accounts and direct bank transfers of subsidies for the needy, cutting out the middleman; of changing the culture in government bhawans of central Delhi, where room-service operations of well-known fixers have declined in the past year.
True, much remains to be done, and the Prime Minister acknowledged that, without explicitly mentioning Vyapam or any other newsy issue. Nevertheless, the thrust of the message was on a long-drawn battle that would require patience. His backing of tough black money regulations, which many feel give too much authority to the taxman, was vintage Modi: willing to defend an unpopular cause if he feels this is right in the longer term. This is exactly what he did with power reforms in Gujarat.
Second, Modi didn't fall into the trap of new announcements and projects. Rather, he focused on many issues that had found mention in 2014 and on other occasions - Swacch Bharat; a better deal for farmers, including in terms of irrigation technology ("per drop, more crop"); toilets in schools and in public spaces; power available 24/7; dignity of labour and a need to see manual and low-skilled workers with the respect that is often denied to them in India's hierarchical society.
He was repeating these because delivery is a work-in-progress. It can be substantially achieved in a five-year time-frame, maybe even longer. More important, it remains a commitment he is wedded to. He was not going to replace these promises with new ones just to decorate another August 15 speech. He was going back to his own benchmarks and will presumably continue to do so in the remaining years of his term.
Third, there are those who consider Modi's emphasis in many paragraphs to the underprivileged as a conscious effort to dissociate himself from big business and a response to Rahul Gandhi's "suit-boot" dig. If so, this again would be out of character for a long-haul navigator. While a quarter of India's people certainly do live in poverty and need help, key parts of Modi speech were devoted to the much larger segment just above the absolute poor but well below the middle classes. These are those he called the "neo-middle classes" in his campaign period.
This group has risen out of poverty in a generation and represents those with aspirations - to borrow from the imagery the Prime Minister constructed in another example - to move from coal stoves to LPG cylinders. This group comprises those with some capital to spare but only a little - though still enough to park Rs. 20,000 crore in 170 million Jan Dhan Yojana bank accounts.
This bottom-of-the-pyramid class were those Modi sought to reimagine as consumers, as risk-takers (those in the informal sector are often more entrepreneurial than business tycoons who invest only what banks and financial institutions give them), as job creators who should be given a fillip to begin small start-ups, even a little shop or repair centre. These are the mom-and-pop businesses that, should they begin to blossom, could revolutionise India. This remains Modi's social goal.
All in all, Modi has moved from the pinch-hitter of year one to the solid middle-order batsman of year two, determined to build the innings. The coming years will tell us if he reaches a century or falls in his thirties or forties. This speech told us he was alive to the need to dig himself in.
The rest is delivery - and destiny.(The author is senior fellow, Observer Research Foundation.

                            From this article it seems he is trying hard to make Modis speech look sensible .As public knows it's all jumlas and does not have any forward looking policy . His speech looks like going back to British raj , helping black money fugitives , not at all caring about defense personal , poor farmers , students ..

You may also write to please his stupid supporter but are you aware they are turning against him, can anyone blame them for being sensible after watching what NaMo has done or hasnt done for India? By the way, you didnt mention about his stupidly glossy attire. Lol

                            How long are you going to remain in denial ? just because you backed him earlier.<br/><br/>
First speech - no accountability - so pinch hitter, <br/>
Second year - reality sinks in - middle order, <br/>
year after that - loss of form &amp; <br/>
2019 - finally announce retirement<br/><br/>
But you will still continue to write how it all looks good.<br/>
The only good thing about modi is that you have such a weak alternative in the form of<br/>
RaGa. So india has to bear with Feku since the pappu alternative is way too scary.<br/>
So its pappu that makes Feku look good.

                            A very fair assessment of Modi's speech. It is better that he scales down expectations given the hordes of people waiting to pull him down. But if he really wants to succeed he better improves his cabinet composition to make it more purposeful. He also needs to follow through more rigourously to ensure that the ball is not dropped. That alone will help him achieve his dream of a Congress mukth Bharat.

                            A balanced article. Modi has to battle an unfair media &amp; so many issues which were slowing his initiatives. For sure Swacch Bharat has created awareness. We want to sit at home &amp; expect the PM to clean up the streets!!! Direct transfer of LPG subsidy is successful. Like me many gave up subsidy on his advise. So things are changing. Let us allow him to work

He can make the whole country to sleep at the same time. He is better than any mother who can make only one baby sleep at a time. Next time please convert his actions not his words.

                            Boring it may have been to the audience actually at the Red Fort.  Uncomfortable too as I saw a lot of people fanning themselves.  However, all the damage that the acolytes of the dreadful Gandhi parivar have done to Modi's authority was swept away by that single speech.  Pappu has his work cut out.  The 'suit boot' wallas are the poor who aspire to bigger and better things and are die hard Modi fans.  The Congresswallas are the Mani Shankar Aiyar types who feel it is the destiny of the Gandhis to rule us and our destiny to accept that rule without question.  The speech was aimed at the 'suit boot' wallas who will provide the jobs that Indians need!

                            You would see the maximum no of Modi haters on this website which itself is anti-govt and pro-congress. Any message hating the PM and making caustic comments against him finds support and more likes. Go to any other news site to know the reality. Guys, have some bit of shame or conscience when writing comments. Here is a guy who worked hard to reach the top, proved himself as a CM, unlike the family party whose so called leaders are where they are only because of their family. You tolerated all the mediocrity of the mother and son for over a decade, but are completely blind to the efforts, commitment of the PM who is working quite hard to make this country a better place to live.I am not saying he does not make mistakes nor is he perfect, but compare him with the other politicians around. He would definitely score the highest marks and way ahead of the current crop of leaders from all parties. If you cannot support him, it is fine, but don/t spread negativity and vent out your frustration due to failures in your personal lives.

                            Why should there be such hulla gulla on 15 Aug speech. Actually, this is not of much significance unless the Government tries to portray 15 Aug speech a real big event and a report card of past year. In that sense, the speech will be good or bad depending on the performance of past year. The speech is not inspiring and boring since performance of the government is bad till now. Although, it is too early to pass judgment on the government and we should wait for one more year at least. The indications are not good though. The planning is lacking and only quick fix solutions are provided which will change with time. It seems government including the leader is lacking on talent...

                            NDTV is impartial in giving space to both Cong and BJP supporters!!! This article is just Modi pleaser...

                            Modi's proactive participation in foreign policy, defence, home security all important issues were conspicuous by there absence in address to nation. Nation was expecting much more from him.Modi did not mention achievement and promises were also missing.Very disappointing independence day address by Modi.May  be he leant mere utterances will not deliver.

                            I can see lots of CONgis and Modi Baiters commenting on this site.To my surprise most of the CONgi's work is been done by CONgi lovers from Pakistan! This is quite a good trend to be followed and adopted by OverseasBJPFriends community for sure.

                            With regard to doing away with subjective job interviews, this is not a new thing.  During the year 1970s the staff selection commission appointment to central government for LDCs, Assistants, Stenographers, etc., were only through written test, skill test and medical examinations and no interviews.  I dont know whether they follow this system still.  I like his speech, though, for his confidence.  I am afraid he is also going the 'Banana' way.  Bahut kuch karna hai and banana hai. This country needs surgical operation (for fighting corruption) not 'malam patti'.

                            Nice article and captures very well what new narrative being written by the PM. Instead of criticising every bit of govt country men needs to support. At a policy level govt is sincerely trying to support development agenda. Country needs this kind of statesman with determination to charter different path.
