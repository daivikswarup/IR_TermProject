Headline::::BJP's Premature Joy at Third Place in Kerala



DateTime::::2015-07-03T13:58:00+05:30




                                A by-election in Kerala has political pundits all excited, because it seems to point to a dramatic new trend in national politics.
On the face of it, it's difficult to see why.
The by-election to the State Assembly, in the rural constituency of Aruvikkara, was won by the Indian National Congress, retaining the seat it had won in 2011. The Left Front, running a CPI-M candidate, had again come second, and the BJP was once again third. At first glance the results suggest the continuation of a familiar pattern.
And yet, BJP supporters on social media were cockahoop, celebrating a result they saw as a moral, if not electoral, victory. The reason? In undergoing his ninth successive electoral defeat, BJP veteran leader O Rajagopal got 34,145 votes - a 23.96 per cent vote share. This represented a significant increase from his predecessor candidate in the same seat, who won 7,690 votes in the 2011 assembly election (six per cent), and even from the BJP's vote share of 14,890 in the 2014 Lok Sabha election (11 per cent). The BJP, they exulted, had quadrupled its share of the vote since 2011. The Congress may have won, but the momentum, they argued, was the BJP's.
I was sceptical when bombarded with such comments on social media. "The BJP came third," I pointed out on Twitter. "Third with a higher vote share is still third."
Political commentators, however, have sat up and taken notice. It is not merely the increasing BJP vote share they are remarking upon - it is the fact that it has come largely at the expense of the Communists. Kerala is a state where anti-incumbency sentiment plays a notoriously major role in the hustings; this was the biggest danger to the Congress, which has been ruling the state for the last four years. But the anti-incumbency vote didn't just go, as in the past, to the alternative major party, the Communists; it was divided between the CPI-M and the BJP, and the Congress scampered home by a majority of more than 10,000 votes.
A similar phenomenon has already been witnessed in Bengal, where the traditionally anti-Congress vote of dispossessed East Bengalis and others has moved significantly from the Left to the BJP. This suggests two things. First, it shows that support for Communism in India actually has very little to do with Communist ideology - a fact brought home to me by a tea-shop encounter in Aruvikkara with a BJP office-bearer who in the previous election had been a CPI-M worker. If someone can vote CPI-M in one election and BJP in the next, he's no Marxist: the jargon of class struggle never penetrated beyond a very thin layer of misguided intellectuals. Second, it suggests that voters looking for a change from politics-as-usual (the customary choice in Kerala, for half a century, has been between Fronts headed by the Congress and the CPI-M) are hoping to find it in the BJP.
If this trend continues in both Bengal and Kerala, the two major remaining bastions of Indian Communism, it will not be long before the Communist Parties are relegated to footnotes in India's political history. One young Congress MLA told me he was convinced that he would spend the bulk of his future political career fighting the BJP; the Communists, he said, would before long find themselves minor constituents of a Congress-led front opposing the BJP.
So are we witnessing the beginning of the end for Communism in Kerala?
The Communist movement in Kerala was never purely about the ideology of class struggle. It also drew strength from being seen as the voice of the lower Hindu castes, particularly the numerically-strong Ezhava community, which, despite being OBCs in national parlance, suffered discrimination almost as oppressive as that undergone by Dalits elsewhere in the country. Mass movements against some of the more iniquitous practices relating to temple entry and temple worship, notably the Guruvayoor Satyagraha, consolidated the Communist position as the party of oppressed groups within the Hindu fold.
Since, as elsewhere, Hindusim's lower castes vastly outnumber its "forward" castes, the Communist Party became the flag-bearer of a large Hindu voting bloc. "The largest Hindu party in Kerala", one very senior Congressman explained to me soon after my entry into Kerala politics, "is not the BJP but the CPI-M."
This explained the paradox that a party ideologically committed to secularism rested on a solid phalanx of Hindu voting support. Since the organized political interests of Kerala's sizeable Muslim and Christian communities never had much sympathy for the iconoclasm of the Communist movement, the CPI-M was able both to preach secularism and portray itself to Hindu voters as the defender of their interests against the minorityism of the Congress (led by several prominent Christians) and the Congress's allies (notably the Christian-dominated Kerala Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League).
That space, as the defender of Hindu interests, has now been occupied by the BJP. It always enjoyed some upper-caste Hindu support, tempered by voters' awareness that since the BJP didn't stand much of a chance, it was wiser tactically to vote for the Congress. The ascent of Narendra Modi has enabled the BJP to credibly seek OBC support as well. He has made three visits as candidate and Prime Minister and always spoken to largely Ezhava audiences. The CPI-M, officially godless, attacks the BJP's bigotry, but despite its championing of the Ezhavas, it has not been able to promote a new leader from that community to supplant the 92-year-old VS Achuthananthan, an Ezhava and former CPI-M Chief Minister now at odds with his party leadership.
Achuthananthan is the most popular CPI-M leader, but he is also criticized daily by the official CPI-M; every time that happens, more Ezhavas turn away from the party. And they flock to the BJP.
The Communists' dilemma is fundamental. For the last 50 years, they have won elections in Kerala by consolidating Hindu votes against the "minority-dominated" Congress. If the BJP continues to expand, such consolidation would become impossible in the foreseeable future, with Hindu votes being split three ways; even if the Congress gets the smallest of the three portions, it attracts enough minority votes to win. The Sangh Parivar will continue aggressively to seek votes on a communal basis, thereby shrinking the CPI-M's base further, especially among the Ezhavas.
Where do the Communists turn to compensate for this political erosion? It is unlikely that the Muslim and Christian clergy will help godless Communism make inroads into their flock. Since the Congress remains the principal standard-bearer of secularism nationwide, there is little point in weakening it by supporting a Communist party that counts for very little in Parliament or at the national level. The Communists have in the past flirted with radical Muslim splinter parties opposed to the Muslim League's pro-Congress politics, but fear of alienating the Hindu vote has always limited the extent to which they were prepared to go with groups like Abdul Nasser Madani's People's Democratic Party (PDP) or the Indian National League (INL).
The Communists' strength remains their organizational muscle, the ability to win funding through extortion, and the willingness to resort to violence and even murder in the pursuit of their political ambitions. With petty power struggles, multiplying cliques and bitter factional fighting diluting the movement, however, the Communists are ripe for the BJP to make inroads into their voter base. In the short run, the obvious beneficiaries of this development will be the Congress.
BJP supporters can celebrate all they want on Twitter, but in the next elections it is likely to be the Congress that laughs all the way to voting booths. We could even swap one letter with the BJP media cell and start a new Twitter trend: #SelfieWithLaughter.(Dr Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Fair point Mr. Tharoor, but if you look carefully the increase in vote share and the shift of votes from CPI-M to BJP signals a trend. No longer is CPI-M, the lower class workers and Ezhava party in Kerala as it has been. Plus all said and done the vote share increasing by 5 times is still significant.<br/><br/>
Plus if you remember the 2014 Lok Sabha elections you just scraped through in Trivandrum and Rajagopal gave you a decent run. So all signals point to a resurgent BJP in a state like Kerala where it was virtually absent all these years

                            What do you think Mr.Tharoor, what kind of readers do read your article and how many of them have an excellent command over English, as good as yours? Simplify your language regardless what you talk or try to convey because most of the readers dont understand the message or point you try to make through a sentence that has words not being used in daily life. You do have a point, quite often than once but it gets lost in transition as well as translation. Momentum aginst NaMo is rising high so take this opportunity to make it the best.

                            Mr tharoor portray congress led UDF is secular. He himself won trivandrum constituency with communal minded minority voting. Right now we Hindus in this state feels only BJP is there to protect our interest. Even if congress comes to power by splitting Hindu votes between BJP and CPM ,BJP will emerge as pressure group and congress won't be allowed to minority appeasement policies which they currently preach. Mr tharoor should be worried that the congress party alone has lost all support of Hindus as it purely now banks in `majority' Christian and Muslim combination. In order to win constituency like trivandrum congress need Hindu support which is now firmly with BJP in far south and far north of Kerala especially.

                            The sum and substance of the article does not support the title of this article. Shashi Tharoor has a way with words and though as a congress member he has to oppose the BJP, he can do it in a way where he tries to present a contrarian point of view. Coming to the article, the article was all about analyzing the vote in Kerala by-elections and the fact that BJP got 3rd position was glossed over by Shashi. Getting ~23% of vote is indeed a significant achievement for BJP. Shashi has admitted that communist strength is its well organized cadre (some would call it muscle power) and to get a significant vote in such a situation is creditable indeed. The use of cadre by communists to control the population and indulge in electoral rigging is well known in Bengal and Kerala. To fight against this is a major task that BJP seems to be learning to do in Bengal and Kerala.

                            CPM has lost two blocks of voters from is traditional base. <br/><br/>
1. Traditional CPM voters South Kerala has ditched CPM.<br/><br/>
This is because, the current senior leadership is 90% from North Kerala. The South Kerala senior leaders are either eliminated from the party, or have been sidelined to some Advani like namesake "Margdarshak roles"  <br/><br/>
2. Traditional CPM voters from the Hindu Ezhava caste ditched CPM<br/><br/>
The CPM in Kerala is now more or less a Nambiar party. (Nambiars are the Nairs of North Kerala). 90% of senior leaders in CPM Kerala belong to that caste. The  senior Ezhava leaders right from V.S. Achuthanandan have been sidelined.  <br/><br/>
(On the other hand, in the past few years the BJP &amp; Narendra Modi have been  wooing Ezhavas like a teenager wooing a neighbourhood rich girl! Aruvikkara votes indicate that a positive response has started from the girl!)

Don't forget the reason why you won at aruvikkara, it is not because of your strength but because of the split in opposition votes(80k votes polled against you, the same argument which you have said after the national election)...

                            It is true BJP vote share has quadrupled in the recently held byelection . It is due to two major  factors , one is the personal charisma of the BJP candidate who has tasted only defeats in electoral contests but has brought in an additional 10 to 15000 votes for BJP and the other is the ascendancy of BJP at the Centre . If one looks at the voting percentages , UDF share declined from 48 to 40 and the LDF's from 42 to 32 . With BJP  gradually and steadily losing the ground at the national level but  may take one more year for a definite assessment of Modi's governance , the BJP may not be in a position to be an alternative to CPM in Kerala . Barring Mr Rajgopal , there is no other leader worth reckoning in Kerala and still winning an assembly seat will remain a pipedream . It is not correct to state that only LDF has lost it's votes to BJP , Congress too lost votes as the voting percentage shows.

                            Hi Tharoor, <br/><br/>
It is cool to hear you again and a little surprised you still have some voice left in your throats. <br/><br/>
It would have been a thoughtful scribbling had it been more introspective.<br/><br/>
What is that with every single vote increase for BJP every paty in Kerala, including your party, are running scared.<br/><br/>
Tell me a good reason, using your smart intellegient political analystic skills, that you call  yourself as surgical, for both Congress and Communits joining hands in not letting the NSS and SNDP take a joint platform in Kerala sofaras political affiliations go.<br/><br/>
Why dont you admit that both Congress and Communist are afraid of the 2 social organizations clasing their hands together and walking with BJP in Kerala.  If you say, Congress doesnt care a call on it, you would only be lieing.  <br/><br/>
Both Congress and Communist will continue enjoying their success only till they hold the two stupid community leaders of NSS and SNDP away from each other.  And these two stupid community leaders will only be able to exert their influence till the day BJP decides to work for total unity of all hindus in kerala.

                            Wow! Little Tharoor has a sense of humour (see his  #SelfieWithLaughter jibe).  This character could not make it to UN Secretary General because of his support for the thoroughly corrupt Kofi Anan who had funds in respect of the Iraq 'Oil for Food' laundered in favour of his son Kojo.  He subsequently failed to convince anybody that the late Sunanda had skills such that she could command US$10m merely by the exercise of her sweat equity.  He has failed to make any sort of impact in the Congress party despite being parachuted into a safe Congress seat.  All in all this character is a loser and any analysis he makes is to be taken with a warehouse of salt!  Let us see if he even contests the next election.

                            Tail piece :<br/><br/>
The Aruvikkara election result becomes interesting by two aspects. One: the minorities are forging behind UDF. It is not the congress victory but by the Muslim league and Kerala congress which dominate the vote share of Muslims and Christians which account 47% of the population. Congress minus ML and KC will be poor fourth if a single party contest is staged.<br/>
Second: BJP gains mainly from CPM means predominant weaker section of Hindu who stood by CPM starting to leave the fold.<br/>
UDF and LDF has lost considerable vote percentage while BJP increased it to nearly 5 fold.So who is the winner?

                            The BJP won the 2014 elections by winning 31% of the popular votes. It was the first time a party had won 283 seats with only 31% votes. Somebody said that in aruvikkara elections the votes polled by cpm and bjp was more than 60% hence it was only a technical victory for congress. So was BJPs parliament victory a technical victory ?? The sangh has been to some extent successful in propogating the narrative that the hindu interests would only be protected under them?? So what specifically are these interests? What specifically are minority interets?? Since the congress is in power are minorities getting free lunch from the government?? All these are merely sayings?? You dont get anything , you have to work hard for yourself. From a development perspective if you build good roads, create employment,infrastructure everybody benefits. In this aspect the congress is ahead of the left??<br/>
And its due to this they won the elections. In a constitutency like arruvikkara which is majority dominated if the congress won <br/>
it could not have won without huindu votes. The myth of minority appeasement and majority consolidation is only a myth , but some are trying hard to make the myth into reality.

                            Shasi is most misguided about  Kerala politics. Communist party - "The largest Hindu Party in Kerala" What kind of an analysis!!. Persons like you are the one those divide people along religious lines and find religion in each and everything. Congress' minority and caste party appeasement has increasingly made Kerala people more concerned about their religion and caste more than what it was 20-30 year ago. Unfortunately, The current communist party is also becoming  opportunistic more like congress.

                            Some facts conveniently omitted by Mr.Tharoor:<br/><br/>
1. Congress lost about 10% votes compared to last election. <br/><br/>
2. If all the Muslims and Christians were voting as per the directions of their clergy, Communist Parties would never have come to power in Kerala. <br/><br/>
3. The by-election was necessitated by the death of the MLA and the Congress promptly put up his son as their candidate, ensuring large number of sympathy votes. They can not expect to repeat this feat in all 140 constituencies in the next election. <br/><br/>
4. Similarly a major chunk of BJP votes were because Mr.Rajagopal was their candidate. Obviously he would not be able to stand from all 140 constituencies in the next election.<br/><br/>
5. In the meantime BJP has pipped Congress as the main opposition in Tripura. Communists retained their seats.

                            Mr Tharoor, you narrowly escape from Mr Rajagopal in the 2014 general election, it was the keralite biggest mistake to elect you to parliament which they realized towards end of 2014 when they seen you going to police station for murder case investigation. Don't forget that NDA got a MP from Kerala in 2004 election and that model is going to sweep Kerala in the next assembly election. For your information, recently most discussed politician in Kerala is Shri Narendra Modi and his future public meetings will demolish Congress and their friend CPM in Kerala.

                            We should read such great articles with high ton vocabulary so that we improve on our language ... no harm in that ... regarding other aspects of his articles and his confidence that BJP wont come up in Kerala and that congress stands justified in playing in the hands of minority communities ... time will prove ... Basically present marxists leadership have no progressive thinking and they like to adopt the same techniques in party administration and politics without hearing the voices of better educated , descent young leaders from the party ... the leadership still believes political murders, vulgar language of their leaders in public , agitations and Bandhs on flimsy grounds , millitancy of their work force  all will help them to retain power but in a fast developing economy with high dose of electronic explosion the leadership should change and unless they do that ,,, Marxists will be an extinct specie soon

                            Tharoor is a sophisticated Mani Shankar Aiyar who had reserved a chaiwala's role to Modi.

                            being a congressman it is  but fair for tharoor to bat for congress but the bjp rise is envitable in the years to come that mr tharoor can not see is not fair analysis.

                            Mr Sashi Tharoor, firstly good article as always.<br/>
Just wanted to point out that the Congress may well have the laugh in the next election , but not the last laugh.<br/>
For eg look at Malabar, a area where the Congress was quite strong historically, but post the alliance with muslim league , the party just exist in name only here, its elected leaders solely being elected using the vote of muslim league.<br/>
the congress still gets support of 30%  hindus, this support will diminish as the league get stronger and will flow to BJP (slowly but surely accelerating when BJP wins a seat). <br/>
the congress will be left with support of a section of christians (maybe 50% of christians) which will give it a voteshare of

                            Guess the change people in Kerala see is UDF largely is becoming non secular , major communal party which was warned by their veteran leader 13 yrs back  .. So that vote is also splitting ..

                            And someone somewhere cares what a certain certified congress bootlicker thinks. Right. What is the world coming to? <br/><br/>
P.S I did not even care to read what he thinks. I just think he should not be thinking in the first place.
