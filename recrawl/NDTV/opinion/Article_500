Headline::::The Great Indian Bank Trick, Blessed By The Government



DateTime::::2016-02-24T18:26:00+05:30




                                Credit, it is said, is the lifeblood of commerce. If so, our banks are suffering from arterial sclerosis. And the borrowers most responsible for this are large borrowers, with exposure of Rs. 5 crore and above, whose share in Gross Non-Performing Advances has shot up to over 86 per cent, according to the RBI's Financial Stability Report of December 2015 (as cited in Prasenjit Bose's article in The Hindu, from which much of the data on which this column is based has been taken).
 
Indeed, according to Credit Suisse Securities and Research, our "severely stressed' corporates include some of the biggest names in Indian business: Adani, Reliance ADAG, Vedanta, Essar, GVK and GMR, to name but some. Accounting for some 10 per cent of the banking system's gross advances, these big businesses are protected by the banks themselves not recognizing that much of their debt now constitutes "stressed advances", thus proving one of the most elementary rules of banking - that if you owe the bank Rs. 5000, it is you who are in trouble, but if you owe the bank Rs. 5000 crore, it is the bank that is in trouble!
 
Bank credit, which was rising at an annual average of 30 per cent during the halcyon years 2004-07, has now shrunk to under ten percent during Modi's acche din. The slowing of the economy has been caused primarily by a sharp decline in investment rates, which causes (and is caused by) the declining availability of bank credit. The banks are in bad trouble; so are enterprises in need of credit.
 
To keep their credibility going, banks roll over much of the debt through a process known as the "restructuring" of corporate debt to make it appear that the banks will be paid in due course. Instead of the banks' balance sheets indicating that these large debts are, in fact, unpaid debts that should be classified as "Non-Performing Assets", they are ever-greened to look viable. Despite such accounting tricks, gross "stressed advances" are in the region of Rs. 9 lakh crore - that is, three to four times the budget provision for social sector and anti-poverty programmes. It makes one think that where the US banking crisis was brought about by "sub-prime" loans, our banking crisis has risen principally from super-prime lending to honchos who prove their worth by holding lavish parties and dining in expensive restaurants even as they wallow in unpaid and unpayable debt.
 
To all this is added the practice of "writing off" debts that are unpaid and can probably not be recovered. The Ministry of Finance are of the view that "write-offs" are basically "technical" and are allowed by the law and RBI Guidelines. In other words, this is a form of creative accounting that enables banks to present a rosier picture in their balance sheets than would have been the case if these loans were classified in the language of the common man. On the basis of information obtained under the Right to Information Act, The Indian Express of 9 February have headlined that a massive Rs. 1.14 lakh crore have been written off by government-owned banks in the last two years, 2013-15. Staggeringly, bad loans now constitute 60 per cent of all loans. Bad debts of the State Bank of India alone now range in the region of Rs. 23,000 crore, four times higher than two years ago.
 
Besides, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will probably continue the well-established practice of granting exemptions in tax legislation that would cause "revenue lost" of around Rs. five lakh crore every year to keep the private sector in good humour.
 
It is in these circumstances that "Make in India" is being sold to potential investors, Indian and foreign. Like the cultural venue that went up in flames at the investment jamboree in Mumbai, so also are the prospects of manufacturing growth in the country being made a bonfire of in the face of a collapse in demand for goods made in India, both within the country and abroad. Exports have been plunging quarter after quarter for the last 14 quarters. And rural demand is stagnating in the light of the government's failure to substantially increase rural incomes. There has been a virtual freeze in Minimum Support Prices; so, rural demand is stagnating, indeed declining in many agricultural sectors because two years of drought, with the government doing little for supplementary income support, has left farmers with little to spare for purchasing manufactured goods.
 
The collapse of demand has led to collapse in fresh private investment. The only way out of this chakravyuh is a massive increase in public investment. But the BJP is ideologically against the public sector. So it seeks to stimulate capital availability to the private sector by forgiving the big enterprises for their past sins through "technical" adjustments to the balance sheets of banks that will enable such enterprises to continue huge borrowings from banks without being under any compulsion to pay these loans back within the stipulated period. To do this, there is talk of setting up a Government-owned Assets Reconstruction Company, which, at public expense, will buy up packages of bank loans, good and bad, at a discounted rate to bail out the banks that would otherwise sink. This is estimated to require Rs. 70,000 crore of your money and mine. Additional capital running to thousands and thousands of crore will in addition be infused into banks by way of "recapitalisation". Thus, both the imprudent banks and their predatory customers will be let off the hook.
 
And who will bear the burden of all this assistance to the richest of the rich? The poor, of course, particularly the poorest of the poor. For, to achieve "fiscal consolidation" - that is, the balancing of the books - budget allocations for schemes for the poor, such as MNREGA, will have to be slashed to find the funds to "stimulate" the defaulting rich. Is this justice? The BJP is discovering the answer in panchayat elections in state after state. Karnataka had just added to the string of reverses the BJP has been facing, beginning with its stronghold in Gujarat. Perhaps they will still learn that we are a poor country.(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

All those supposed loans were basically loot of the Congress. Not showing things as NPAs is what is fraud! There is absolutely no tax involved here, you are blabbering Mani

                            Dear MS, For 90% of India's independence congress has been in power. Most Senior positions in Banks, PSUs and Govt depts are staffed by those who are appointed by Congress (ie Congress Supporters). Loans don't become Bad in just 2 years that BJP is in Power. Loans become bad when they are allocated to doubtful projects. In fact banks have almost stopped giving Loans in the last 2 years. Most loans that are NPA now were disbursed during the time Congress was in Power. Problem has to be fixed, but if they were allocated against week collateral, it is difficult to recover.  Have some sense and work with Govt to Recover the money from problem caused by bad policies of congress. Don't waste time writing biased articles.

Your param pujyaniya Sonia Gandhi was running the country.what these steps were not taken then to make all banks to come clean on NPA and show in their books? ARC was a brain child of Congress. If the govt wants to do it then why should u hv any problem? Past attempts of private companies getting into ARC has been a failure. I guess its better for you to go to Pakistan and deliver lecture there. One thing I fail to understand about NDTV. What has kept them asking Mani to continue to write such bakwas every now then then? Have some constructive criticisms not mindless allegations.

                            Very sad to see a clever man like you has to make a living out of criticizing Modi or his Government. It's ok that you made a "Chaiwala" comment during the election campaign in the heat of the moment. Unfortunately for you Modi gained a lot from that comment and it has become your huge nightmare. So when you wake up in the middle of your sleep due to this nightmare you want to take revenge on Modi so you start writing bad about him. It has become your mission to criticizing Modi. Stop making yourself a laughing stock for the readers and use your clever brain in something more useful.

                            All these bad loans were given to friends of the Congress party and much of it was the result of corruption where bank money was later given to Congress politicians for facilitating the bad loans. This is one more massive scam which requires the complete investigation of the Congress Finance Ministers, Ministry of Finance officials, bank executives and big businessmen. Wherever major loans are shown as outstanding or sought to be written off, there should be a complete CBI investigation. Hefty penalties including life imprisonment should be awarded to the guilty as they have destroyed the PSU banking system and thousands of crores of public money has gone into the pockets of these criminals.

                            Stop your lecture already. It is important that the nationalised banks are healthier, and is also important that they are accountable. This government is trying to bring some accountability by making the bad loans situation transparent. What did your government do when you were ruling? Mind you, most of the bad loans were issued when your teams were at the helm. Disgusting hypocrisy.

                            Being a banker, I can appreciate the technicalities mentioned and explained in the article. I am sure the ruling class will have some plausible explanation. The fact remains that bad debts of banks are built of huge amounts of a few large corporations. Only those with political clout with the rulers of the day, manage to get those huge debts written off. This exercise can be safely termed theft of Public money. I remember from UK, theft or robbery from a contracted out post office, is treated as theft of public money and is considered the most serious crime.  On the other hand in my Bharat Mahaan, stealing/robbing or embezzling public money is the easiest crime. And with contacts at right places, the police, politicians or the investigating agency officers, makes the matters so much easier. While robbery at the PNB in Ludhiana, in the nineties was a case which fell in the category of criminal act, the corporate route of robbing the banks does not even fall in any category inappropriate activity.

NPAs are the loans given many years back and definitely during congress rule and mostly to Gongress fellows owned. Govt must release names of these defaulters so that public can judge.

I read them not only for their contents, but also for the flowing english and the way the points are coherently put across. The collections will be a good material for those looking for taking up their english language skills to the highest level.Short and brief, the articles also effectively communicate with full assertiveness the shortcomings of the ruling party. It may not be to the liking of the supporters of the ruling party, but an impartial, unprejudiced and a neutral person,  if not fully, but to a large extent  will definitely, agree with your views.

                            Most current bad debts are because of careless lending which happened long before the current government came into power. Recent RBI data on Divergent NPA trends show that as of September 2015 the 'medium' and 'large' industries are most responsible for the mess that the banks are in today. Then there are the megalomaniacs who throw lavish parties even after being labeled a 'wilful defaulter'! Images of shackles and rigorous imprisonment come to mind. But, this has always been the situation in India, people with money twist, bend and break laws so that they and only they can sleep well at night. That said, we have in Raghuram Rajan a highly intelligent and capable RBI governor who is working to get the banks clean up their balance sheets. I only wonder if he had not pushed for this at what point would the banks have declared this on their own?! Ha! wishful thinking. Let us be very clear, CLEAR, that these NPAs did not appear in the last 2 years but have been in the making for quite some time with the explicit knowledge of the previous government. So, Mr Aiyar please do not take the high road and use attractive language to fool the people. With regards to the Karnataka panchayat elections, please do not fool us again, it's the sheer incompetency of the local BJP to gain any confidence of the people and the infighting and bickering has led to their downfall, I hope that they learn lessons from this debacle. So, this is a case of people choosing the worse from the worst of the lot! But, Mr Siddu is in a league of his own, there are hour-long TV slots showing him eating local chicken biryani while the Namma Metro project is indefinitely delayed, roads are in a mess and the city literally stinks! You are a well-read, well-traveled and well-connected man, why don't you provide constructive feedback? This Budget Session of the Parliament I dare your party to not walk-out of the Parliament and let it function and allow passage of critical bills. Remember that you only have 45 seats in the current Lok Sabha, do not give the impression that you are blocking progress, who knows, the 'poor countrymen' might just say 10 is enough in 2019.

                            An Excellent article. The poor has to finance the bad debts of the PSU banks. The Govt. is doing an eyewash in the name of recapitalisation of the banks decapitulating public wealth of the poor. The government in the past has been giving loans to the rich to make them richer and now they are unable to repay and who foots the bill, the poor public of the nation. The FM should do something concrete to raise the stressed finances of the country by appropriating the wealth of those debtors from their deposits in foreign banks.

                            Totally misleading article, <br/><br/>
Facts <br/><br/>
- Majority of NPAs are in public sector banks not private banks<br/>
- Majority of NPAs are extended to public corporations like state electric boards etc.. not Adani's, etc. <br/>
- Almost all of these loans were extended during UPA govt<br/>
- 'write offs' which are presented as some kind of conspiracy by Mr Aiyar are actually according to RBI guidelines which forces banks to write off starting from last quarter of 2015<br/><br/>
In short Mr Aiyar is trying to justify Congress policy of investment in public sector using the example of NPAs without mentioning that public sector is the cause for NPAs in the first place

                            Mani Ji... do you have facts that any of these loans or programs were the current governments agenda. Don't say just because you think it is to be true, approach with facts. When you have it, challenge the government in parliament and not in Media or Editorial columns.<br/><br/>
Don't waste the time of Indian citizen.

                            Bhakts as usual saying congress at fault. Well chaddis u think no loans have been disbursed since 2014? Actually the govt is now clearing of big corps so they can take even more loans.<br/>
And lastly even if they have to write off loans then why not lower and middle range loans?...why only the ultra tich gets off for free while bank confiscates everything poor and middle class people own?

                            Restructuring assets is one of the standard ways of preventing a potential NPA.I dont see anything wrong in this. Infact Modi govt. should be commended for taking tough decisions to clean out NPAs. Also the article seems to clearly not mention that most of the bad loans were sanctioned during the UPA regime. Also Modi govt should be lauded for not removing UPA initiatives like MNREGA, Aadhar etc. Infact the current govt. is trying to make it better in terms of direct cash transfers,less subsidies etc. Although economic problems due to recession cannot be blamed on UPA govt. , due credit should be given to Modi govt. for taking tough measures and not falling to vote bank tactics of giving more subsidies to rural poor.

Not one word on how your colleagues in the UPA used their political clout to arm twist public sector banks into making un-viable loans to dubious promoters who have now disappeared with the money ..You now want the strengthening of the public sector why ? so that there are more public sector banks to be looted when you get power again ? clever !

                            These corporate have been created not in one day. All major mess of Bank is related to UPA tenure this know fact to all. I dont think why he is always crtical to Modi Govt. He should have analysed the data more purely and understood it clearly. Bank are being cheated and all officer with nexus of Political mess have done what ever they could. It is not the system, but a weak govt structure always provide the structure to loot the money of public Exchequre. During UPA Govt Mr Chidambram was made Finance Minister, it is Known to every one how his relative were involved in Indian Bank Scam, <br/>
How his wife is involved in Shradha West Bengal Scam. <br/>
I would request the opinion should have independent view not biased. I agree Modi Govt initiative too is not working very effectively. Blaming every thing some thing look like you are a another Rahul Gandhi not an intellectual.

What MSA is projecting here is that all the issues have been caused by the current Govt, which is grossly incorrect. Cong has ruled this country the longest and should own up to the problems they have created. The corrupt practices followed by the banks happened under their tenure if not at their instigation. I may not be a big fan of the current Govt but can surely appreciate the effort to actually recognise the problem rather than hiding it deep in the books. Lastly this may offend you but in this  argument you are looking more of a BHAKT than @Analystatix, he just made a case against MSA and not praised NMO

                            Banks have standard agreements with all the borrowers whereas these agreements work well with the small and mid size borrowers.  The recent Companies Act amendment took over 2 decades in which more protection shown to the FD accounts and filing of returns.  Now the banks that lent/lending to the corporates do ask for more protections like - (a) not allowing the defaulting companies to declare dividends; (b) suspension of trading in SEs. (c) Quarterly voluntary advertisement stating HOW MUCH THEY DEFAULTED by the defaulting companies along with their financial results; The bank's representation in boards of companies which is there for a long time has not worked to the advantage of the banks.  Name and shame are not useful to banks and this will make the small and mid size borrowers feel bad.

                            I think MSA has some points there. But the issue is that this is not just a industry-bank nexus that causes these defaults. It is more a case of Industry-Bank-Politician nexus that causes defaults. <br/><br/>
It is also important at this stage to say that some of these defaults are due to the stressed economic conditions which are taking time to sort out. What is needed is to ensure that the banking system does not become a conduit to get large financial write-offs for badly run organisations.
