Headline::::He Carried His Gang-Raped Daughter 14 Kms on his Back



DateTime::::2015-01-24T15:31:00+05:30



(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)On January 22nd, the Madras High Court  issued a show cause notice to the Tamil Nadu police. The case has not received the attention it should have. This is what it is about.A 16-year-old hearing and speech impaired girl is brutally gangraped. She is found unconscious in a field adjoining her father's small farm. Her body bears the marks of brutal savagery, bites and scratches and big bruises. She has been beaten on her head with a log. She is bleeding. Her injuries tell the story she cannot express, of the violence she was subjected to, of her resistance, of her pain.The village is far away from the main road. It is late at night. When dawn breaks, the father carries his daughter on his back to the nearest bus stop 14 kms away so that he can take her to a hospital. Bent down with her weight, he doggedly takes one step after another with only the one thought of bringing justice to his violated daughter.But as the days pass, he learns that his hopes were as far removed from reality as her rapists were from humanity, that there is a dark side to the system, the side of embedded criminality, that kills hopes for justice.It happened on the evening of December 25, 2014 in the village of Keezhkachavur, and he was taking her to the taluk headquarters and hospital in Denkanikotta, Krishnagiri district, Tamil Nadu.But it could have happened anywhere.In December 2012, just two years earlier, the country had mourned the death of Nirbhaya. India promised its women and its children justice, both preventive and punitive, against sexual assault. Governments and law-makers were forced to change the laws to make them more stringent, and to frame rules so that the victim could more easily access justice.The recommendations of the Justice Verma Commission that were included in the new laws that were adopted by Parliament were sections on the protocols required if the victim was a minor and also separately,  a section for the protection of a victim if she were disabled.Two years after the law was adopted, the trauma that the  girl in Krishnagiri faced could have been eased by implementation of these important legal reforms. The crime against her was what has been defined in the new law as "aggravated sexual assault" which shifts the onus of proof of innocence to the accused and which invites more severe punishment.  In her case, it was aggravated sexual assault on three counts: being a minor, being disabled and being a victim of gangrape.But instead, it was the law enforcers who added the fourth dimension to aggravated crime.They violated the very laws they were meant to enforce.The girl is a minor so the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) 2012 should also apply, apart from the post-Nirbhaya amended laws. According to POCSO, the Special Police unit for assault cases on minors (or the local police if the special unit is not formed) should take up the case and refer it to a Special Court "without unnecessary delay." The girl lay on a hospital bed examined by a doctor, but no medical report was made - according to the hospital, it could be done only when the police came. The police did not come. The direct evidence of DNA was lost.POCSO mandates the girl's statement should be recorded not just immediately,  but in the presence of her parents, in familiar surroundings and that the victim should not be taken to the thana or questioned by men in uniform.In this girl's case, five days after the assault, without registering an FIR, at midnight the girl and her father were taken out of the hospital by the police on the plea of getting a medical test done in a bigger hospital in Hosur. But instead of the hospital, the girl was taken to the police station. Her father was sent away and told to come back the next morning.The law specifies that a disabled girl victim should be able to give her statement to a person who understands sign language. But far from being provided an interpreter, the traumatised girl was forcibly separated from her father and locked up like a criminal in the thana.Worse was to follow. She was taken the next day for a medical test. And then taken back to the thana. Both father and daughter were tortured. The father was slapped and spat upon by the DSP. The girl's foot was stamped upon by a constable wearing boots. She was again separated from her father. He could hear her screams. The girl was then taken by the police to the village to the place of the crime.  She was made to reenact the scene.There is a reported nexus between the criminals who raped her who are involved in an illegal ganja trade, the police who take bribes from them, and the local unit of the ruling party. One of the accused is an elected ward member. Instead of arresting him immediately, he was given the time to use his power to mobilise the entire village to ex-communicate the girl's family. The  electricity connection in their home has been cut, they have been denied access to common water sources, they cannot enter the temple;  in short, the victimized family's basic human rights have been bulldozed by the nexus to force them to come to a compromise.Women's organisations have fought hard to get the law changed to include accountability and punishment against personnel who sabotage investigations in crimes against women. As a result of these efforts, a new section, 166A, has been included in the IPC which provides for punishment  of those who do not carry out an investigation according to the law.In this case, from the senior officer who physically and verbally abused the father to the constable who tortured the victim to the doctor who did not file the medical report, all should be charged under Sec 166A and arrested.This has not happened.It is because of the courage of the family and the support of the local unit of AIDWA and the Tamil Nadu Differently Abled Organization that the case could reach the Madras High Court which has issued a show cause notice to the police.Girls from poor families who face violent sexual assault like this girl did are the anonymous victims for whom few tears are shed. Living in remote areas, a disabled girl from an economically poor family has little hope for justice.The number of rape cases was  close to 25,000 registered cases in 2013, of which 12.5 per cent were rapes of minors. Shockingly, the processes of justice  even for minors is so slow that there were as many as 33,328 cases of rape of minors pending in the courts according to the National Crimes Research Bureau report of 2013. Of the cases where trial was completed, a high 70 per cent of the accused walked free.If the conviction rate is so abysmal,  some of the reasons  lie in corrupt politics, in compromised police personnel and in the power of the kind of nexus that victimized the girl in that remote village in Krishnagiri district. Yet India has a better legal framework compared to many other countries. But the political will and commitment to implement laws is absent.It is only public pressure which will force change which will make the difference. It can be done.  In this case too. Extend your support. Become the voice that shouts out for justice.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

But I have one question.<br/>
Mrs Karat what steps did your government take in west Bengal during your 15 years rule. Statistics show that west Bengal is among the worst of states. Is there anything different being done in Kerela?

                            India is a banana republic without a single language, single education system, lawless traffic, lawless policing, worthless Govt. Administrations in states and centre. Most of the educated people are not bothered as due to the discriminatory practices in education systems ( english medium vs. other mediums) chosen few enjoy the wealth and opportunities of the country. These people are well off monetarily and even the lower rungs of those have flats, cars, holiday outings etc. the great thing of India is only probably its strong family values and humane nature of many people, unfortunately we are losing those good things also very fast.

We'd like to help but through which means? It is a disgusting situation in India that we all need to counter for sure. People don't realise, until such an incident occurs with its own family. Why wait till that extent?

                            So heart wrenching. Madam you have access to Parliament and should take up very strongly and ensure justice is done. Country really needs very very strong laws and severe/harsh punishments for crimes against women. All women should get together and settle nothing less than capital punishment for crimes against women.

                            But for Brinda Karat the media would have even glossed over the incident as there are no big stakes at present unlike in the case of Delhi where media led the frenzy mysteriously backed by political parties and their oxygen suppliers openly and vociferously by by fledglings  trying to find elusive political space

                            Considering the media frenzy and frenzy by affiliates of poltical parties and political parties themselves over a heinous incident that took place in Delhi a couple of years ago, the lack of response to this equally cruel and ghastly, if not more, incident is ominous and reflective of the indifference of the public to incidents that keep taking place in less well known centres as it may not bring grist to political mill. To put it succinctly, a rape in Delhi seems to be more importatnt for protestors and political parties than a rape in remote corner of Dharmpuri district. It can be reasonably deduced that protests in Delhi were politically motivated rather than driven by any altruistic consideration

                            In most cases it has been seen that the police heap a second round of torture on the victims, especially if the victim is poor. Lets see if the system( including the courts) deliver justice. May God give the victim and her family ( especially her brave father) solace.

                            Unless India deals with the manner in which the police abdicate their duty in such situations and destroy the police nexus with criminals, I see no hope in attaining justice for women in India who suffer such heinous crimes. If these criminals ever get charged they know the wheels of justice are so slow that the case will disintegrate with the passage of time.<br/><br/>
Laws can and have been created by government, however it is the will of a government to implement laws which decide the maturity of a democracy and nation. This case also confirms that this barbaric rape epidemic in India is not a North or South divide issue it is rampant all over India in both cities and villages. The tragedy is that victims from villages have far less chance of achieving justice due to the dynamics described in this blog.<br/><br/>
If only this government could aspire to achieve Justice in India with same vigour as the Make in India campaign. Where are the promised rape centres announced by Maneka Gandhi????

                            Political parties in general seem to have no sensitivity towards such incidents and play up only if there are political gains . In the subject case, the ruling party in the state is an ally of the ruling party at the centre and both of them seem, by their reactions, as if they could not care less. For the central government a heinous rape in a school in Bengaluru is worthy of attention as there are imaginary or real political gains in a state where they are out of power . After all, political parties do not embarass their allies in states for political expediency. It is a shame that neither the DMK nor the Congress party nor other parties in TN have have kept mum instead of organizing succour to the beleaguered girl and her father.

                            Injustice creates chaos and unrest in  civil society and leads towards destruction of living systems. Whoever culprits are and their supportive partners in police and politics personal creating hurdle to get justice for poor victim and saving their criminal partners for sake of money or political gain should be punished severely. Otherwise sooner or later this system will pay heavy price for injustice of poor people.

                            We she hv a law where police funds and salaries pay for the girl victims hospital and recovery until case is settled (similar to kin of police who died in line of duty). They can get reimbursed frm accused. If no accused is brought to justice then they lose the money spent. Why citizens taxes shd pay for incompetent police service if its not working and delivering good product? We don't do that for our cell phone service.

                            it is really surprising that this woman who assumes a Durga  avatar simply by virtue of his one-rupee coin size bindi, continues to make noise. It is true that the average official attitude towards outrageous conduct against innocent victims is rampant and this requires not more laws but  change of public social attitudes. What has these pompous and self-righteous "leaders" such as herself done in this regard. The average Indian individual is at a discount and it is worse if the poor blighter happens to belong to very low castes or a Dalit. This attitude is prevalent in Bengal where her own party ruled for three decades continuously and in Kerala where they continue to make more noise than justified. So instead of harping upon the obvious in hi-fi columns in English media, let herself and her husband and other party stalwarts 'do' something solid.

                            It is really sad that a poor girl was so badly brutalized.  Like this how many cases have been miss-handled in India and the law does very little to protect the victim but does a lot to protect the culprit.  The law makers and protectors like Police Department are probably the worst in India compared to any other country of the world.  India cannot change from the dumps unless we Indians change.  We only boasts about our culture, Ghar Vapasi but not a finger is ever lifted to really help those who are the least of our fellow humans.  Congress did very little when such cases were reported and I was hopeful, Modi will do something and again, I am dead wrong.

                            Tamil Nadu is still a place which lives in the middle ages. They elect film stars as chief ministers, and lawlessness is the rule than the exception, even in their cities like Chennai and Coimbatore. Even with the many Dravidian parties which have been around for decades, these people have not been able to extricate themselves from medieval wretchedness. Let us hope that the criminals are brought to justice, and get the punishment they deserve.

However this alone does not help, please take some action maam you are a MP and also please guide us as to what we can do in this case? Is there a way we can help the girl not esoteric and utopian suggestions like vote for the right candidates (I do not think there are any right candidates anyway). <br/>
The problem has to be followed through we cannot just express indigation and move on. I request Ms.Karat and NDTV to follow this up and also please let us know how we can help to help the poor girl and also bring the officers to book.<br/>
Hoping this does not just disappear.

                            ..May God give her and her family  mental strength to cope with such a severe trauma..<br/>
Coming to the reality in India ... In  many villages in India why even in cities ... even today ...in such heinous and serious crimes....the hands of the police are tied from taking serious actions due to the pressure from local powerful people (local goondas politicians etc) ....They warn the police of dire consequences or even threaten to cause harm/serious injury to them and their families..So Unless such underworld/ indoor local  threats are dealt with severely and not let off the hook easily police would perhaps continue to behave like this .We have seen such illustrations  in so many films..<br/><br/>
To Ms Karat .Thank you for making us aware of such a miserably suffering girl and the pain of her father .<br/>
.But mere awareness is not enough ..There is no use in stopping to act  after writing columns or holding protest marches .<br/>
Actions speak louder than words...Generating mere sympathies among the public wont do... please do something productive and really beneficial to the pitiable girl and her loving father..and to make police fearlessly responsible!!!!!!<br/>
being a communist party leader please do spread more awareness among the less educated not to consume alcohol becoz it is the root cause of many social evils....to prevent such crimes..and incase of worst situations  also on not to have fear but to proceed legally ......

                            Nirbhayas case and extensive media coverage  would never stop such acts.!!!!!!!There is some corruption in police department everywhere and the persons doing such devilish crimes are often locally powerful and they try to take advantage of the loopholes in the law through bribing  those corrupt police men ....<br/>
Often the poor women who suffer such serious trauma end up as victims without any compensation and endup also false branded as women of disputable character and their families also suffer humiliation ..<br/><br/>
These Mens attitude should change drastically and they should view all women with respect and not with lust  .They should be taught to avoid consuming liquor as it causes more evils .<br/>
Laws protecting women should seriouslly act without taking too much time  People at public service  like police /registration office etc should be taught human values seriously ...

One thing you all have to accept is that the attention it should get was not given. so atleast lets act now. Pathetic treatment, political influence and muscle flexing ....think of the plight of that poor father.....traumatised girl...cant even be said as inhuman. more strong words reqd to condemn and  more strong action to be taken. immediate arrests etc etc should be done. suspected officers should be under suspension till enquiry. Madam create protests. public will support and join in large numbers.

                            Its a shame on democracy. Even though Ms Karat has taken up the issue and the Hon'ble High Court taken up the issue, the vital evidence and support to the victim has been lost. It would be crucial to nab and take legal action upon the culprit. As mentioned, he is a ward member of the ruling party and the government machinery would be giving full support to the culprit instead of the victim. Its one way of corruption. No law of the land is implemented

Being a political leader, you must bring this up in Parliament (if at all it does any business) and get the govt both in centre and state to act.<br/>
Nobody should pass the buck.  The police and the criminals involved must be punished in a fast track court in 15 days non stop hearing.
