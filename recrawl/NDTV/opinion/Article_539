Headline::::Rahul May Just Have Put BJP on the Defensive



DateTime::::2015-05-01T23:46:00+05:30




                                There is a kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder while discussing farmer suicides or the new incarnation of Rahul Gandhi. Farmer suicides evoke a kind of melodrama which has begun to benumb the readers of the press or viewers of the TV news media. Worse, there is a feeling that the media is cynical and the political class is hypocritical.
 
This cynicism and hypocrisy was evident again this week in the response to Rahul Gandhi's visit to Vidarbha in Maharashtra. Chief Minister Devendra Fadanvis said that Rahul should introspect about the spate of suicides that took place when the Congress-NCP alliance was in power for 15 years. So yet again, the farmer was placed before the execution squad of the NDA-UPA who strive to win brownie political points at the expense of the tragedy that is enveloping the country.
Chief Minister Fadanvis tried to appear decent and democratic by advising Rahul to offer suggestions to the state government on what should be done. But it is not as if this government or the earlier UPA is in the dark about the reasons or the solutions to the problem of rural distress and debt-burdened farmers. Maharashtra has some distinct agricultural features programmed by its geography and history. Most of the region is a rain shadow belt.
The state, when carved out in 1960, had only eight percent of the land irrigated. Even now, despite all the dams and canals, it is just around 16 per cent. The reason is not just corruption, which of course cannot be underestimated, but the complex terrain, the river belts, the rainfall, the deteriorating climatic conditions and fractured geography. For instance, the Marathwada region is heavily drought-prone, and yet, till recently, it was not a suicide belt. On the other hand, Vidarbha is relatively fertile, with rich cash crops and farmers less oppressed than Marathwada. Yet the Vidarbha region's three districts witnessed the maximum number of suicides in the last two decades. The suicides in Marathwada, are relatively recent, but no less horrifying and the number is increasing. Poverty, drought and deprivation have been the features of rural life in Maharashtra for centuries. But that did not lead the farmers to take their own lives.
The "culture of suicides" in the agricultural belt is a recent phenomenon, mainly after liberalization in the 1990s, which did bring roads, telephone networks, television, newspapers, education, health services and allowed proximity to urban areas and city markets (health facilities and education did not spread as much as media and telecommunications though).
But the most crucial point was that the cost of producing crops, vegetables, fruit, sugarcane, went up phenomenally. That also was because of liberalization, as the input costs were higher, and lifestyle changes were not cheap. The sons of farmers did not want to be farmers because it was neither profitable nor fashionable. Sure, the farmer has to be liberated from the clutches of the land and economic noose around his neck. But that could have been done by making farming profitable. By making him financially independent. Not by just promising him a glorious future of industrial-corporate India. Even that would not offer him well-paid jobs or a better lifestyle.
In Modinomics, the government bought the farmer's land and sold him dreams. That was the Gujarat model. The Congress did not improve his quality of life, but did not sell him dreams. So, the problem exacerbated with the BJP coming to power at the Centre as well as in the state. While the Congress cannot acquit itself, the BJP cannot say it is not guilty. Further, instead of showing concern and compassion, the BJP began advising the farmers about his duties towards making India a superpower. The BJP in general and the Sangh Parivar in particular have no roots in the agricultural community. It is a party rooted in the middle class, upper caste and recently in the rural neo-middle class disconnected from farming. So they neither have comprehension nor care for this community.
There are essentially only three issues that have created the crisis. The first is the farmer is getting more and more burdened by the cost of his production. He has been assured time and again that Minimum Support Price will be given to him for his crop. In fact, last year in this very month, Narendra Modi had condemned the UPA's anti-farmer policies. He had said in the election rallies in the same Vidarbha region that he was personally committed to ensuring farmers receive MSP plus 50 per cent more.
 
And now he has begun to pontificate that the MSP is dangerous because it generates a massive inflationary cycle. His friends in the neo-liberal economic community, seemingly driven by the Tea Party faction of the Republican Party in US, are advising him that the farmer has to be liberated from land. He has to be brought in the mainstream industrial economy without which India can't become a superpower. Therefore this an ideological question. Whether to follow the neo-liberal model of development in nineteenth century version of England and bring the peasantry to its knees in the world of Charles Dickens, or follow the Chinese authoritarian model of driving the peasantry out by force and make them proletarian slaves.
The second issue is how to deal with the climate change which is hurting  agriculture. The government has not yet defined it's policy on environment. The Modi regime  wants to dispense with "anti-development" ecological policies and encourage national and multinational capital to invest in India to manufacture. That is what Rahul Gandhi seems to have attacked. This is why the BJP has possibly suddenly gone on the defensive.
The BJP and Modi in particular have come to believe that Rahul is an ineffectual 'Pappu' and the Congress is virtually dead. Suddenly, Rahul has hit and they don't know whether to attack him about his recent lengthy absence or his critical comments.

                            You mean to say 10 year UPA and Congress NCP combo in both centre and state were less responsible than BJP who is in power for 10 months. Being a journalist you must be neutral while addressing a serious issue like farmers suicide. You are worse than a politician. You have no right to blame anybody but yourself. Shame on you presstitute.

Modi government want to provide better irrigation project to farmers so there will be not much lose in their product and number of suicide case will be reduced, but still expect AAP model suicide.

                            For most of the people, this is Rahul Gandhi's desperate attempt to remain relevant in India's political landscape and nothing short of a failed politician trying to relaunch his career.

                            Congress being a GOP naturally had many members from farming community in its rolls. The party started at a time when there were no significant number of other professions. Congress even had yoked bullocks as its symbol. If the Congress is so concerned about the farming  community then why it abandoned this symbol and went  for the " hath "?

In 2008 farmers loan was written off but did it stop farmers suicides. so we should arm the farmers with rural infarstucture like irrigation, power, roads, cold storages, markets.

                            LAND ACQUISITION BILL IS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO STOP FARMERS' SUICIDE<br/>
Data table shows farmer suicide from 2004 to 2013 of major states. These figures can be half within 5 years only if bill implemented immediately.<br/><br/>
1. 2008, UPA govt waived farmers' loan Rs. 72000 cr. Purely pre-election move to fetch votes.<br/>
2. Subsidies for MSP and food 125000 cr + Urea 72000 cr + add power/Diesel.<br/>
3. Total Rs. 2,75,000 cr.<br/>
Such a huge amount even could not stop suicides, simply means we have to think some better alternative.<br/><br/>
Since independent farmers' suicide is a big issue reason is 60% farmers has contribution of only 15% in economy. Even with 15% contribution, we are able to fulfill crop requirement for India population. Simply means there are much more people in farmer profession than the actual requirement if they can accommodate in other alternative source of income they will not make suicide. Only way to stop their suicide is to generate more and more employment so farmers can accommodate in other lucrative professions.<br/><br/>
Various surveys have suggested that farmers and agricultural workers want to get out of farming and move to more remunerative jobs.<br/>
1. In 2014, the Delhi-based Center for Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) published a survey-based report called "State of Indian Farmers", said 76% of farmers employed in agriculture wanted to do something else; 61% preferred an urban job.<br/>
2. National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) report found 56% of small farmers with less than 100 sq m of farmland earned the majority of their income in the form of wages from an external job. Agricultural income was marginal to their household expenses.<br/><br/>
Considering NDA government honesty and sincerity no reason to keep doubt in mind for misuse of land. Bill will benefit to farmers and poor people only.

                            Hardly surprising that Mr Ketkar is also joining the bandwagon of Rahul admirers, totally oblivious to the Congress hypocrisy feigning concern for farmers, and worse, to Rahul baba himself suddenly spouting sarcasm and jibes with noxious play on words in attacking Mr Modi and his government, merely to make his presence felt in the Lok Sabha where, with his under whelming performance and casual visits over the last TEN years, he was not only inconspicuous but absolutely ineffectual, either for his party or for his constituents. One swallow does not a summer make. Mr Ketkar should bear in mind the incontrovertible fact that farmers have been brought to the plight they are in to cause such concern in Mr Rahul Gandhi only owing to the indifference and apathy of the Congress Governments in the States and the Center past 2004. YSR conducted his famous Padayatra and won in 2004 on the false plea that Naidu ditched the rural while wooing the urban. But it was during YSR's corruption ridden and scam tainted Congress regime that thousands of farmers committed suicides. And Mr Modi's Government has been in place for just ten months while Rahul's mother presided over the UPA's (mis)rule for ten years. Is this not a classic instance of the pot calling the kettle black? But Rahul, being only a politician can be excused. Mr Ketkar, on the other hand betrays his extreme anti Modi, anti BJP bias by drooling over Mr Rahul's new found and suspect burst of energy.

                            To expect fairness and neutrality from a reporter like Ketkar is too much of an expectation.Maybe the Paki will give up Kashmir but corrupt and tainted will never change their behaviour.The reporter does not have any background in agriculture , sericulture or any culture ,but still he can pass on comments like he is the expert.The defeciencies in the irrigation have to be removed to relieve the farmer of his woes.how does the Sangh Parivar come into the picture?Where is Al Qaeda ,MIM ,All India Bakchod....... ?he is comical, trying to vent his hatred on some group.These sold out people will gather clicks and also kicks

                            Lets accept without admitting that BJP is a Middle class Upper caste party &amp;  has no background in Farming. But it has come to power last year (even one year is not over yet). Ku.Ke.'s favorite Grand Old Congress Party - which is called party of the masses - is in power for last 60 years. What did it do to drive the farmers to this stage? Only Ku.Ke. can see SUBSTANCE in Rahul's speech, &amp; only Ku.Ke. can imagine RAHUL GANDHI forcing the government on defensive. Let Ku.Ke. ask Mr. Gandhi whether Potatoes grow above ground or below ground!

                            The problem 'Globe Trotter' Kumar Ketkar has is that nobody listens to his advice.  And quite rightly so; he brings in the Tea Party of the USA into the discussion,  he brings in the England of Charles Dickens into the discussion and he brings in Chinese systems into the discussion.  Neither the average BJP worker nor Modi will have heard of the Tea Party or even Dickens!  None of these apply to the average farmer in Vidharba who is burdened with a tradition of exploitation that is unique to India as it is mired in with caste politics, including such concepts as bonded labour.  India will have to come up with its own solutions for its own unique problems.  Modi will in due course resolve the problems and as for RaGa, he is irrelevant to all but the boot-lickers such as Globe Trotter.

                            Till when Govt will waive off the loan of farmers(it will also not solve the issue as Congress has since 1947 made farmers total dependent on the mercy of the govt).  No body is talking about the side effect of loan waver which greedy opposition is demanding.   It means loss of money to the bank which means increase in interest rate for other people it means inflation it means de-evaluation of Indian currency.  It means slow down of economy.  It means lack of jobs it means lot.  Have you forgotten the sub-prime crisis in US.  That would also lead to suicide of many people for want of jobs .   At that time also same opposition will cry.  Farmers do not pay income tax they get free water the congress has made them totally dependent at the mercy of govt which has now become dangerous. <br/><br/>
Instead we must talk about making farmers self-dependent by creating other opportunity for him to earn regular income.  For that we need industrial growth better irrigation system (for higher production).<br/><br/>
Land bill is absolutely necessary for our country for rapid growth. Those who are opposing it for political mileage are anti-national <br/><br/>
Shame on the writer for glorifying Congress PR stunt and making it into crusade for farmers.<br/><br/>
Rahul Gandhi is not joke but curse to India at this time.   Congress party is concerned about Rahul Gandhi future not the future of India and farmers they want India to remain third world country so that they have the opportunity to point fingers and back their bread.   These so called writers do not understand the basic economics.   It is true that everybody including daily-wager must reap the maximum benefit of growth but that should not happen at the cost of each other but with each other.<br/><br/>
LET US NOT MAKE FARMERS A LIABILITY ON THE COUNTRY.  LET US MAKE THEM FEEL THAT THEY ARE ALSO PROFESSIONS LIKE ANY OTHER PROFESSIONAL.  LET THEM GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE PERMANENT SOURCE OF INCOME.

                            You have left out the fact that the farming industry has been neglected at the expense of industry. We talk of Big Bang reforms, but in our mind this refers only to industry. A Big Bang reform is urgently needed in the farming industry as well. We talk of infrastructure, but in our mind this refers to cities, roads, ports and airports. But we need infrastructure for the farming community as well in terms of better connectivity, cold chain logistics, revamp of the mandi system, allowing farmers to sell directly to the consumer by giving him the required infrastructure to be able to do this. We need food processing industries to allow the farmer to sell his produce to a varied customer. And of course, we need water. Not dams, but bunds, and irrigation systems.  But alas. All out netas do is pay lip service, give out doles, and pocket money meant for their betterment. Look at the irrigation scam. Even though the government has changed, has there been any genuine movement to bring to book those that looted our state at the expense of the farmer? But yet they will wax eloquent on the subject of farmer suicides. If that isn't lip service, then what is?

                            This foolish rahul went to nepal embassy to condole the earthquake victims , when time comes to write a condolence message this fool didnt know what to write on his own , instead he copied from his phone written by his script writer. He copied from his phone n the whole world saw it . Not a single media channel made it an issue , instead of rahul any other leader in particular bjp leader had done this media n likes of ketkar n mani had made it a big issue of it . This shows how much media n journalists r biased , media n journalists r not neutral anymore . Mera bharat mahan ..

                            Ketkar is living in 50 years old time warp of neo liberal neo socialist neo Marxist etc.Please understand the ground reality.When a potatoes farmer takes his produce to cold storage he does not get MSP and even if he gets he gets paid 8 to 9 months later otherwise he has to discount his receipt at a much lower price<br/>
apart from underweighing.The story with Government procurement agencies is even worse. The farmers have been driven to desperation mainly because of neo leftists like Ketkar have little idea of farmers yet their advices and counsel was adopted<br/>
by UPA advisory council<br/>
The mentors of Rahul are themselves come from Royal background or neo rich super rich that he would never be able to strike a chord with farmers

Rahul Gandhi is being given more airtime than Relief work in UP, WB, Bihar and Nepal. RaGa has just returned from an unknown place and media was just waiting for him.<br/><br/>

Also, when did someone get his/her flat on time from the builders. There are instances where the flat possession was given after six years of the actual date of possession and based on the Current market price. The builder was never black listed. This happened during Congress rule.<br/><br/>
Give Modi 5 years, if you think that he has not done enough the do not elect him but do not cry now when you did not cry ever in the 10 years of Congress's misrule.

Don't make it so obvious. We all know you are a congress supporter. But still as a journalist you could have been a slightly neutral for the sake of such a good analysis that you presented. Btw, out of two decades you mentioned, it was congress which was ruling for 15 years in Maharashtra and 10+ years of congress ruled center. Do you still wanna blame Modi for the current state of farmers? Really????

                            Rahul Gandhi's efforts are coming at right time, not only to rejuvenate congress party but also to combat campaign of making mockery by RSS-BJP on existing institutions, bringing foreign manufactures which is against once their swdeshi slogan. Most of farmer's suicides are happening where villages have rich land-lords &amp; they support certain majority political class. Another threat from this RSS=BJP government is communal harmony, the way last one year has emerged, more threatening for India's Multi-Religious society. Hence revive Congress which fundamentally recognizes essence of India rather RSS=BJP who have more influenced from western fascism.

Whom are you kidding: Congress is precisely doing this. Raking the issue to get political mileage. Ketkars have suddenly woke up to the farmer's tragedy that is "unfolding". Really. I guess all those farmers and laborers who committed suicides in the past were "virtual" farmers.<br/>
Modi is trying to address the problem but Ketkars want to put their faith in Congress.

                            The author is correct when he says that although both the congress and the BJP betrayed the interest of the farmers the latter has bewitched the farmers in the last election by selling them dreams. As such, the present thrust of the government schemes, clearly designed to help only the corporate and industrial giants the BJP is betraying the farmers. And Rahul is just exposing this vulnerable spot of the ruling party. If he sustains the tempo and mobilizes other opposition parties BJP will be forced to stall many of their pet schemes as they have done with the 'Land Bill'.

                            First time in my life have i read ketkar wrting about 95% of the artical on issues and 5% on politics.....hope this is beginning of acche din in journalism....all journalists must bring expert advise and on the ground realities to the fore and not the political bikering between the parties....the public is only interested in on-the-ground facts not political rhetoric...thanks ketkar for the informative and non-partisan article.

                            Not just now sir, Rahul has been putting BJP on THE defensive, ever since he has entered 'active' politics and thankfully, we could see the results.

                            For people calling ketkar as modi hater, i don't understand two things. How can he hate anyone cuz his religious beliefs don't allow him to and secondly, what does that have to do with the article? Why is this country getting into " only like modi &amp; bjp" phenomena? It seems the right wing idiots don't understand democracy anymore.

                            This article started with the concern about farmers soon forgot farmers and ended criticizing BJP and praising Rahul ( Forget Sonia !) . What else can be expected from a member of  "Dehli Club" ?

                            A very perceptive article by Kumar Ketkar. Let us hope that a realistic agricultural policy is put in place and implemented consistently as this is the only viable way to prevent farmer suicides.
