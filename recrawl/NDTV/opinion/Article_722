Headline::::'Baahubali': Racist, Sexist and Utterly Unmissable



DateTime::::2015-07-23T21:34:00+05:30




                                For me (and for countless fans watching this behemoth of a movie across 4000 screens world-wide), the best thing about SS Rajamouli's 250-crore magnum opus is that I could "see'' where the money has gone. It is one of the most visually stunning, spectacularly-mounted movies in recent memory, in which clearly no corners have been cut. 
What an extravaganza! And if you are wondering whether there is a story after all this gush about the look of the movie - surprise! surprise! - there is, indeed! 
India now has its own lush and lavish, sensuous and richly-textured fairy-tale, which like all memorable fairy-tales, comes with kings and queens, courtiers and slaves, castles, palaces, horses, warriors, battles, feats, treachery, valour, nobility, blackguards, princesses... vaghera, vaghera. Only, a fire-breathing dragon is missing. But worry not, there is an 'Androcles and the Lion' moment thrown in, where, instead of a lion, there is a maddened bull. SS Rajamouli must have scrupulously studied the great spectacle movies of Cecil B DeMille like 'Samson and Delilah', 'The Ten Commandments', 'Cleopatra', and incorporated all the required elements into his own blockbuster. (Four languages, and the fastest entry into the 200-crore box office club - let's call 'Baahubali' the big gamble that paid off).
I watched it at a friendly, neighbourhood multiplex, with what can only be described as a chi-chi South Mumbai crowd. The kind that orders steamed edamame beans during the interval, and avoids nachos. On a rainy, mid-week evening, the hall was packed! I ran into a couple of acquaintances, who ducked, obviously embarrassed to be caught watching this "weird" film. A stranger walked up to me and asked with exaggerated amusement, "So... what are you doing at a movie like this?" Excuse me! I could have said, "Same thing as you..." A movie is a movie is a movie. Even if I went for the show without knowing too much about it, I went with an open mind (the only way to watch movies). I had figured if 'Baahubali' was seriously yucky, I would at least enjoy the 'healthy bhel' (no potatoes, no fried sev or kadak pooris) and go home for a large shot of Old Monk. Within the first two minutes, I knew I was in the right hall, watching an amazing movie.
It must have been those waterfalls.
Gushing water is the leitmotif of 'Baahubali' (think Freud, all ye with dirty minds!). At some point or the other, nearly every major character has a 'waterfall moment'. 'Baahubali' himself is attractively drenched in the first half, and since Prabhas has a pretty ummm... well-defined, muscle-walli body, nobody is complaining. Ditto for the ravishing Tamanna, who starts off clad in nothing much more than iridescent blue butterflies fluttering strategically over her svelte self, but somehow gets forgotten as Avantika, Baahubali's love interest, once the narrative moves into heavy-duty war scenes with the bloodiest, goriest violence, graphically depicted in loving close ups of mangled body parts. Not since Raj Kapoor stuck a curvaceous Mandakini under a waterfall in 'Ram Teri Ganga Maili', has a heroine sent out such a strong, sexually-charged message. The drenching never ends - even enchained, middle-aged mums (Baahubali's) aren't spared!
By then, viewers are totally hooked! To the violence and the sexy scenes. The item song in 'Baahubali' is pretty ingenious - let's call it the new version of the old Indian Rope Trick. Pitting two unambiguously hunky men (Prabhas and Rana Daggubati) against one another is also a pretty inspired move. While Prabhas resembles a younger, better-looking version of Rajinikanth, Daggubati holds his own in a villainous role. There is an abundance of naked virility combined with agility in the movie, and the scene in which Baahubali uproots and carries a mighty lingam on his broad shoulders, comes with its own subliminal subtext! Poochho mat! Kya powerful imagery!
The story continues in 'The Conclusion' (the movie I watched is "The Beginning'). What struck me is the idea of male attractiveness as defined by mainstream Bollywood... and how differently it is exploited in a movie like 'Baahubali', which is unashamedly driven by testosterone. Prabhas and Rana Daggubati look great! And far more attractive than some of the overpaid Bolllywood wimps we watch in mediocre films. These two fit their respective roles perfectly, and play macho warriors with enormous flair and credibility. 
Granted, the love songs could have been avoided, but the romancing was pretty creative (underwater doodles on a sweetheart's slim hand, while she sleeps). I fell big-time for the fantasy. And I loved the Rajmata's exquisite nine-yards ki kashta sarees (you need a great bum for this saree style to work). 
Now to the downside - of course, the film is shamelessly racist (the dreaded dushman from across the border are blackened faced tribals resembling Zulu warriors from old Hollywood movies). The unwashed, uncouth, barbaric warriors fight Baahubali's army, impeccably turned out like Roman gladiators! Yup. That crude. That obvious. 
The movie is sexist, too. But no more than most movies. The women are powerful, alluring and courageous, ferociously taking on adversaries and putting up a pretty tough fight - make-up and hair intact! Haan bhai! 'Baahubali' racist hai. Sexist hai. Sab kuch hai. Toh bhi picture achchi lagi! What to do???
The man who stole my heart was not Baahubali - but his loyal slave Kattappa, marvellously played by Sathyaraj. It's safe to state I am ready to pre-book my ticket for Part-2, just to watch what Kattappa does next.(Shobhaa De is an established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator, who is considered an authority on popular culture.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            This movie is tight slap on Hindi Film Industry, or should we say Bollywood or couple of families who run the entire industry. Hindi film industry seems to have finest actor, directors and all the glamour yet there hasnt been anyone to finance such a huge epic. Not a single director have a courage to give more attention to details, set and skills of craftsman rather than one hero. Would they accept that south is leading and they have a lot to learn from them?

                            Dear Shobade,<br/>
Two things struck me right off of your review:<br/><br/>
1) A stranger walked up to me and asked with exaggerated amusement, "So... what are you doing at a movie like this?" <br/>
Wow! Are you saying that moviegoers don't want to be seen and that they feel embarrassed if someone sees them at a screen playing Baahubali? Where did you get this from? I am not certain, if you totally made it up or you were fantasizing your own fiction. Either way, it spectacularly displays your mediocracy.  I have read several news reports and main stream media coverage on families/extended-families, both in north and south India, booking up tickets in advance and enjoying the movie together.  This is the first time, I ever heard of an Indian movie charming audience across the nation with its brilliant visuals. Now where is the question of people ashamed to watch this movie?  Check again, maybe it exists just between and a little above your shoulders.<br/><br/>
2) Racist &amp; Sexist<br/>
Racist: I do not see any racism in this movie.  If you think of Indian sub-continent and its indigenous population pre-Christ era, there was such population that was systematically annihilated, their lands occupied, inter-marriages by the fair skinned attacking forces.  This is also historically true. Just because, the movie shows fictional dark skinned Kaleyas doesn't mean its racist.  All people should be proud of themselves irrespective of their skin color(fair/dark/medium toned). Why don't read your own lines of comparing Prabhas to Rajinikanth as a better version of the latter. You totally lost it.<br/><br/>
Sexist: I agree with you that the protagonist's romantic play with his lady love was a bit over the top (sari unravel scene and tattooing her body).  Its a whimsical-period film where the director has used his liberty yet portrayed highly respectful female characters.  I do not think the movie has crossed the line of vulgarity. <br/><br/>
Shobade, I know you are better than this. I understand that you are paid for your reviews and that you try really hard to get as many eyeballs as possible.  But, please make your grey matter work a little harder next time you write a review. Yes you can!<br/><br/>
Respectfully,<br/>
An proud Indian from the southern badlands

                            Shobha need not be so condescending, this "South Indian" movie in infinitely better than any Bollywood movie and De is not that superior!! Even though the review itself is very positive, she as usual irritates with stupid and irrational comments like racist, sexist, etc., apparently without knowing the meaning of the words, with due respects to her English. Where is racism in this movie, set in the backdrop of a few centuries old fiction? No need to try and act as a superior North Indian which, I repeat, is highly irritating as we all know about this laughable complex.

                            We can clearly see the cognitive dissonance of people like Shoba de. She clearly loved the movie but...but her 'friends' are saying it is racist and sexist, what to do? Those accusations were refuted by many people already. Even then if she doesn't call it racist and sexist she would be kept out of the club, she will not be invited to TV news shows, literary festivals, give space for her articles. What to do? She says she loved it but had to add those keywords. I can sympathize with her, a girl has to eat right?

                            Why are you taking such a high pedestal by saying and acting as if watching a south Indian movie is beyond your dignity?  In addition, you are acting as if you were doing southern people and the directors from the south a favour by watching the movie openly?  Aren't you ashamed by your own behaviour?

                            Racist, sexist really??? how, where, why! All I can see in your review is the racism towards non - bollywood movies. There are only positive vibes about this movie every where not just in India but all over the world. I watched this movie on a week day in remote corner of USA and it was house full!! Well if you watched the 'weird' movie in a local multiplex that 'cos good movies never get screens. The screens are given to pathetic movies from the Khan club. <br/><br/>
I think as a writer or an opinionist its important do some homework prior to writing about the movie or the director. I just pity the amazing talented and skilled directors like Rajamouli. His previous classic work like Magadheera and Eega have been extraordinary.<br/>
He is not any random director who is trying join a 200 crore club! Nobody cares about hitting the 100 or 200 crore as much as in bollywood.<br/><br/>
All the soo called great movies in bollywood be it PK - remake of another bollywood movie(oh my god), Dhoom 3 - classic hollywood movie 'prestige' turned into crap or the upcoming remake of face off. I mean just name it and the story stolen from tollywood or hollywood. I don't want even mention about other two khan's. They should just stop making movies now!<br/><br/>
Bahubali does have some inspirations from epic hollywood movies but isn't great harry potter also inspired by 'Lord of the Rings'? Its the filmography, innovative war scenes, majestic visual effects and least of  all the effort or dream to create a movie like this. Bollywood really has some learnings here, the last movie of this dimension was Mughal-ee-azam made 55 years ago and will be only movie for next 100 years !!!

                            You spoke my mind. Kattapa is the suspense here. Satyaraj's action is superb, bordering on awe. So is the entire movie. Baahubali: The Beginning - is made with so much care, precision, and heart that the movie finds a place in our mind. We think about the movie long after seeing in the theatre, kindling a subtle urge to see once-more. Kudos to SS Rajamouli for bringing his vision on the celluloid.

                            Mrs Shobha Dey.....this film is 100% Indian in every aspect. So many characters yet so strongly &amp; excellently portrayed by the Director.  With Shiva Strotram in the background, beautiful waterfalls, this is our culture. Not like Bollywood Movies (with some exceptions)which promote vulgarity, making fun of our Gods, Violence, Sex, non-sense acting by even big stars etc. It is time now, they should change their strategy, otherwise people shall start rejecting their Big stars in no time and prefer Dubbed Regional Movies. After 100 years of Cinema- No Oscar till now? Shame. And they feel proud of their movies?. They should concentrate on Quality rather than Quantity. This movie is definitely going to win OSCAR.

                            It is indeed a tight slap on the face of Bollywood. As because in almost all Bollywood movies the name of the Hero must be Rahul, or Prem and he must be from a wealthy Punjabi Family, who travels to Switzerland in search for his love, or else show Lord Shiva in a Toilet-Pissing, Sing sufi song when his lover goes away from his life. Even after 100 years of Indian Cinema they could not win an OSCAR in the foreign film category. And their directors say that OSCAR is an International Award made for only Americans, then how come Satyajit Ray won it as a special life time achievement award way back?. And he belonged to a very poor perhaps poorest Bengali Film Industry. When asked this their filmstars say the love of their fans is OSCAR for them, what a excuse?....

                            She didn't say whether she liked the movie or not. Whatsoever this movie was a big hit and stands for Indian pride .No matter everybody loved the movie, we may think that the war scenes were copied. So what? At least they did something which our Indian directors have ever done. In my opinion BAHUBALI was a visual treat and a great movie in Indian history.Respect that fact and appreciate their hard work instead of criticising it.

                            The movie story is from historical era. And ofcourse they had problems of nondiscrimination, sexism, sati-pratha, no women rights etc. Such movies are also shown in hollywood. Our mythologies like ramayana, mahabharat and characters like ram, arjun, chanakya were all sexist. Please write articles on that also. Its just a movie and they will show what our past was like. For god sake, please find a better topic to write articles.

                            I heard about this woman before but did nt read anything by her. <br/><br/>
This is the first article I have ever read of her. Her inflated self perception screams in every line. <br/><br/>
"So... what are you doing at a movie like this?" - "same as you"<br/><br/>
This text has multiple subtexts.. he perception of "people's perception of The Shobha De' is above and beyond galaxy. She is a classy lady who watches hollywood arthouse movies and  She down plays that with "same as you" by showing her generous side. Hail, Mrs. De. <br/><br/>
Let me get to the point where she talks about movie being racist and sexist. Does she have anything original to say or she simply blurts confirmed opinions. If she did nt feel black is inferior to white she would nt have brought that up.<br/><br/>
Powerful women dont wear makeup or do their hair? I dont know if its pure ignorance or an attempt to sound intelligent. <br/><br/>
Miss. De, Goodluck with your naval gazing.

                            Please read the article completely. She is speaking the immaturity of a Bollywood movie lover. Time to adapt different movies.<br/>
Movie must be praised for its content. It must be noted that Bollywood is slowly learning and including south flavors by remaking/dubbing more movies now. Be it Gabbar - a remake of tamil movie Ramana", rowdy rathod (btw, it is SS rajamouli's telugu movie "vikramarkudu")<br/><br/>
At the same time, masala movies are there everywhere. Be it Sharukh in North or Vadivelu in south.<br/>
You cannot deny the quality movies produced in Bollywood as well - Bhejafry, Burfi, Bombay velvet. Success of the movie should not be gauged with the money it makes

Call this movie feminist. Women in the movie play a really strong role.<br/>
And, you, who consider yourself to be an epitome of modern women, are the one making sexist comments about bum.<br/><br/>

                            If you know mahabharat and times of Krishna, you will understand that certain areas did not have a culture. I remember very well that kalayavanas king chopped off his father's head to succeed throne. While jarasandha is still shown in Mahabharat as very sophisticated warrior. It all depends on the history. If you talk about sexism, oddily enough all other movies like Troy, Gladiator aren't sexist at all. I wonder why you choose to always weigh in more criticism than praising an Indian movie who had the guts to show case glmises of Indian war strategies, culture of respecting men women of principles etc. At the end, he shows how morality triumphs and a women's dignity is restored. Sad you missed it.

 She is talking about friends meeting in the interval and what a weird film they came to. If the film is weird it wont join 300 crores in less than 10 days. Todays movies will and should have all the commercial elements. If its not for your poplularity stunt I believe you should re- watch the film with good sound system.

                            As a telugu speaking person who has a love hate relationship with Rajamouli thanks to his portrayal of women, I agree with you completely. Yes, the much publicized rape of avantika irked me to no ends but it was forgotten as the movie progressed. So yeah sexist, racist etc. but so are most of the mainstream telugu movies. Crying over it on a well made 250cr movies is a desperate cry for attention. FYI Rajamata is an excellent actress who has not only stood her ground but also dominated the screen as a villain in a Rajni Kanth movie.

The salves in the Kingdom were treated similar the way shown in Gladiator. The Bull fight is inspired by Russel Crowe in the Colosseum in the Gladiator.

I am proud that somebody brought up such a powerful character for women on screens. LOL it took this long and rajamouli's movie did it. It inspired a 5 1/2 yr old daughter.

Author is taking it out of context and comparing it to historical events/figures. I think this author has misunderstood, nothing is racist until some act or statement is directly demeaning to certain class. Separation of "blacks" n "whites" taking a bus ride, for example.

                            Does shobha de pay ndtv to get her articles published? This is a simple question and the answer would also be simple "yes" or "no"

                            Look who is talking. Shobha - you speak as if your novels are worthy of Man Booker Prize or Literary Nobel. The footnote says you are an "established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator". You are none of the above, so stop commenting on Bahubali or any other movie.

                            Shobhaji, please forget the escapist world of Tollywood, Bollywood and all the other woods.  Please re-enter the real world.  I have not seen the movie and have no intentions of doing so.  I have, however seen marketing photos of a character lifting what appears to be a heavy lingam.  This would be impossible anywhere.  Not even the strongest weightlifter would be able to lift such a deadweight and such a shape.  Unless, of course, what the actor is lifting is made of cardboard, which it probably is!  All I can say is that there are a lot of actors who are silly lingams in the movie, crores and crores of income notwithstanding.

                            We don't need such big reviews about movies. The 5 star reviews are enough. Write about something constructive that the nation needs to hear. Especially on this platform.

                            Depicting indigenous people as villians is dangerous to the idea of secular India. Attempt at minting money at box office with visual wizardry is only an businessman, s dream but a failure as an artist.

                            ePlease read the article completely. She is speaking the immaturity of a Bollywood movie lover. Time to adapt different movies.<br/>
Movie must be praised for its content. It must be noted that Bollywood is slowly learning and including south flavors by remaking/dubbing more movies now. Be it Gabbar - a remake of tamil movie Ramana", rowdy rathod (btw, it is SS rajamouli's telugu movie "vikramarkudu")<br/><br/>
At the same time, masala movies are there everywhere. Be it Sharukh in North or Vadivelu in south.<br/>
You cannot deny the quality movies produced in Bollywood as well - Bhejafry, Burfi, Bombay velvet. Success of the movie should not be gauged with the money it makes

                            @VIG Southee: I am a marathi born and brought up in Hyderabad. Please accept my apologies. Shobha de is a marathi but sometimes she brings shame to our community by writing such articles. Is she David Frost- What are u doing in this theatre? oh my my!But when we see crap like this we start appreciating good articles even better.

                            Dear Ms. De,<br/><br/>
Recently when Chetan Bhagat was distressed by the subjugation of Indian women I informed my worked up WhatsApp group all women anywhere needed to do was read you regularly. The bindassness would set them free.<br/><br/>
So, when I read ' utterly' we went for a 'butterly' experience.<br/><br/>
Ma'am, your review fell short:<br/>
- Super movies are not just entertainment. They are also a celebration. Baahubali-1 is an ode to the human spirit.<br/>
- Perhaps lifting of the Lingam had obvious connotations. Shiva was rewarded with the Yoni! But it could also have invoked the Mahabharat. Who can forget Abhimanyu, the second generation, with the chariot wheel at the centre of the Chakravyuh? Here we see Shiva drawn into the maze bequeathed him by his mother.<br/><br/>
- The Pandavas emerge rolled into one vs. the Kauravas rolled into one. The movie takes up the question  'what if Gandhari were not blind?'.<br/><br/>
- Then there is that last question 'what if Bhishmapitama was a man of action instead of lofty words?'<br/><br/>
Grand questions. They open the mind to the truth of the Mahabharat. Will I agree with it? Yes, my appetite is whetted for Part-2. Androcles comes a poor second. It is Baahubali,Avantika and Sargami all the way till now. And, yes, Katappa too.<br/><br/>
Thanks for sending me to the movie. Media reports are not always believable.

                            250 Crores or somewhere there to make a movie in a nation still clueless and utterly not bothered about public health, sanitation, primary education and what not! And the way it is promoted, looks like it is an unpardonable sin if one does not watch the movie. Our capacity to decide on our priorities - like this - is stunning. APJ Abdul Kalam would be proud. Go on, India...Godspeed !!!
