Headline::::Forget Reparations, Britain, Release The Files



DateTime::::2015-08-04T22:15:00+05:30




                                So much has been said and written about the speech that Shashi Tharoor delivered at the Oxford Union in May that we may wonder whether there can be anything left to add to the discussion. But one point that does not seem to have been made, or not made loudly enough, in relation to what is a complicated subject has less to do with reparations and more with the preservation and study of the colonial record. Everyone knows that wrongs were committed in the name of British colonialism, but we are still far from having an adequate, richly-textured or nuanced account of the British Empire. In order to arrive at a deeper sense of British colonialism, and indeed of colonialism in general, we would need to be able to read the "official record", that is, the many files, documents, petitions, and policy papers that were part of the everyday transactions of empire.  
 
Vast holdings of these files exist, in the UK and other countries, but it's not easy to pry them away from the clutches of zealous functionaries and politicians. Governments refuse to grant access to papers from the colonial era on the grounds of national security even when the events mentioned in the files date to the nineteenth century and earlier. Our knowledge of the colonial period is drastically impaired by the embargo placed on important files and will not improve substantially until these files are placed in the public domain.  
 
I said the point has not been made loudly in the media, but William Roger Louis, who is an historian of the British Empire and who also spoke at the debate in Oxford, did, in fact, insist on the need for the British government to show "complete transparency of what happened" in its colonies and dependencies. As he said, "the full record has never been revealed" by the UK, and "the disclosure of secret records...would not only preserve facts for posterity but would be a way of acknowledging for the public record the darker side of empire".  
 
Such a disclosure, he remarked, "would be the acknowledgement of a moral obligation".  In 2013, a similar view was expressed in the Guardian by Richard Drayton, the Guyanese-born scholar of empire who teaches in London: "The older a document, the less it belongs to those who make it or keep it, and the more it is the property of humanity in general. These 'special collections' belong neither to the FCO (i.e. the Foreign and Commonwealth Office) nor even to the British people. They record how the modern world was made, and people around the world deserve access to them and to the truth."
 
Louis and Drayton are right to put pressure on the British government in this matter, given the government's inconsistent attitude to the release of files. The government refused to release files on the Mau Mau uprising until 2011, when the Foreign and Commonwealth Office conceded that it possessed some 1,500 files relating to Kenya at Hanslope Park, a country estate in the borough of Milton Keynes. Many of these documents were part of the legal proceedings brought against the UK government by Kenyan victims of torture, and it was the law case that prompted the government to move forward with its release of the papers.  
 
A couple of years later, in 2013, the FCO disclosed that it held 1.2 million files at Hanslope Park, many of these going back to the nineteenth century. The figure was subsequently adjusted to 600,000, but at this point one, is inclined not to trust official counts of files relating to the Empire and, in any case, the retention of the papers appears to have occurred in contravention of the Public Records Act. Some of the files have now been moved over to the UK's National Archives (and contain revealing particulars about the slave trade), but it's safe to say that most have not. 
 
On 21 January 2015, David Lidington, then as now a minister of state in the Foreign Office, issued a written statement in which he said that an "internal management audit" had thrown up the existence of another 170,000 files. He added that while a "significant proportion of these files contain copies of original records or routine management, finance, personnel and consular records", some of the files were "likely to require permanent preservation"- in other words, were unlikely ever to be made public. The Foreign Office has since published online an inventory with broad headings, and it is clear that many of the documents will be of immense significance to historians of the colonial era.  
 
A quick search, for example, indicates that the files pertain to sedition in India, Partition, the last viceroyalty, the Indian Civil Service (1908-1911), India Office papers, and so forth. The files relate to all sorts of topics, important not just for colonial modernity but for the history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Many of the papers are not going to reshape our knowledge of anything, but many will deepen our understanding of the imperial bureaucracy and policy-making, and some of the documents may even lead us radically to revise our interpretation and analysis of crucial historical events. Until the files are made public and deposited in the national archives, we cannot know.
 
The issue here is not just poor cataloguing or preservation, but the will of functionaries and politicians to open up records to scrutiny and judgement. The UK government is not being asked to release documents that concern "national security", or that will offend the sensitivities of innocent people. Drayton said in 2013 that "no British person alive should feel pride or guilt about events that happened before they were born". What the British government can offer is the release of thousands of files that colonizers and colonized alike have a justifiable and legitimate reason to consult. The government is doubtless wary of lawsuits and compensatory payments, but the lessons to be drawn from the study of history are priceless.
 
As for reparations, the right to compensation is easy to discern in some cases (e.g. the Mau Mau) but harder to determine in others: it is unfortunate that commentators on the question draw on statistics of a dubious nature and participate in a discourse that is overheated by nationalism. I think that Shashi Tharoor grasped the complexity of the problem when he asked, with brilliant simplicity, for no more than one pound per year for the next two hundred years. It is precisely because colonialism is charged and difficult, its wounds still raw and open, that we need to take care to understand its history and arrive at an informed analysis.

                            Indians might have a better chance of getting India's historical files from the UK's National Archive than from their own PMO. <br/><br/>
For example, the files relating to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose from the late 1940s to the late 1960s are yet to be released by the PMO, even though they are 50 years old now. And that too, with a BJP government in power!

                            A very insightful article. There is no liklihood of reparation. The debate on reparation would be merely to please their respective audience of their nation. It is unlikely that repartion would ever be paid and perhaps that amount of money does not lie with the colonizers of the past. But parting with historical records is very much possible and would contribute to understanding the history better.

                            I like it when NDTV bring in non-political people to discuss an interesting topic. Well supported arguments, I wholeheartedly agree. A fresh departure from political rants

                            reparations - yes! Files or records...hmmmm..why would we want to insist on the Brit records when we ourselves are guilty of NOT maintaining any records of colonialism! I can understand pre partition the freedom fighters busy liberating us, what about post partition when we had intelligentsia like Nehru and other who were half Brits anyway with impeccable english who could have done some record keeping. In any case, not that we have been able to preserve or even make sense of the little records we had of the archives. Seems nice to expect the Brits to pass on the colonial files when we were witness to the massive 'cleanup' of the Govt offices by the present Govt with files dating back to 1960s, something as basic as that was not cleaned up as the successive Govts and Babus were busy doing what they ere familiar with - minting....

                            Whether the British Empire did India good or bad, whether it made right decisions or wrong, whatever it did is HISTORY. It's time to move on and look under our own collar before we play the same 'let's bash the British' record again. As a society and government, the UK is far more transparent than we Indians are likely to be anytime soon. <br/><br/>
To view the events of the past from the present-day perspective is called a Historian's fallacy and it's something anyone with an interest in history should avoid, especially historians!<br/><br/>

                            Shashi Tharoor should first of all visit New Delhi, Calcutta,Mombeil orBombay and Chennai or Madras and also the present conditions of all<br/>
the pavements of these majaor cities well created by our Colonial power or British government which are, without any doubt, the real héritages of British government offered to India.<br/><br/>
New Delhi is one of world famous capital and Mombeil remain still as a world commercial capital. so We should not talk too much and blame the British government for our mistakes. They created best modern  way of life with modern cities and roads.<br/>
Do we, now maintain all these pavements of these majaor cities?<br/>
Do we preserve well the best British built universities in India?<br/>
It is not  Mogul empire,Maharajahs,who built this modern India but it is by British Empire . All these railways roads, highways,hospitals,universities,Indian constitution and Congress were well heritage of British government.<br/><br/>
What do you mean indian Congress?<br/>
The congress was part of British work to form the future indian leaders to take care of the Indian administration after the independence.<br/>
But if you look the Indian present  Congress you will understand the real but present image.<br/>
All corrupted leaders from the day of Independence  were ruling India.<br/>
There are 2 millions or more indians are living and enjoying their life in Britian. Since the Independence the British government was donating every year one billion of pounds for all social works and other charities.<br/>
so we Indians should now thank British government for what they have done to bring India out of Jungle rule by Mogul or Akbar.
