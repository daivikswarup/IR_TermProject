Headline::::For MPs, No Work, No Pay is Deserved



DateTime::::2015-08-04T13:48:00+05:30




                                The recent logjam in the Indian Parliament has sprung up a dozen of important questions in the air. Is naming a Member or mere suspension of an errant Member from the House enough to ensure the smooth functioning of the House? Is there a better way to resolve the parliamentary deadlock that has been reigning in the current Monsoon Session?
Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation, Mr. Mahesh Sharma has proposed a 'No work, no pay' rule for the parliamentarians as a disincentive to protests as a means to stall the functioning of Parliament. In India, a Member of Parliament continues to receive his salary even after being suspended for creating disruptions in the House. It is interesting to note that though Indian Parliament has yet to implement the aforementioned rule, other countries have been successful at it and have ensured smoother running of their legislatures. 
In the United Kingdom, there is a rule for the Members of the House of Commons where the salary of the Member is withheld for the period of suspension. Though there have been rare cases of suspension of salaries of MPs due to grave misconduct which disrupts the business of the House, the fear of this sanction has improved the state of legislative business to a large extent. The idea of 'No work, no pay' is also catching up in other countries. Recently, on June 24th, 2015, the African Debating Chamber proposed the National Assembly Rules which talked of disruptions in the National Chamber. The rules state that the members will have their salaries docked when removed from the Chamber for hampering the business of the Chamber. These rules were admitted by the Parliamentary Rules Committee. This move was rationalized by the government to prevent the replacement of debates with shouting and screaming.
This principle of 'No work, no pay' is not new in India. There was a case in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly wherein the Privilege Committee of the House suspended some of the MLAs for a period of six months and during that period, they were not eligible to receive salary and other allowances. This report of the Privilege Committee dated 21.3.2013, was placed before the Assembly, put to vote and by majority, it was accepted. The suspended Members challenged this decision in the Madras High Court. The Hon'ble Madras High Court has held that a fair procedure was adopted before taking the decision to suspend the appellants for a period of six months with corresponding withholding of salary and other benefits and therefore, it cannot be said that they have been condemned. Though this precedent is not declared authoritatively by the Supreme Court, an adoption of this principle may work well considering the present situation, as the sanction of suspension of salary of an MP may serve as more of a deterrent than mere suspending or naming a Member in the Parliament. In cases of people disrupting proceedings, the presiding officers have limited powers to act. This impedes on the rights of other members to discharge their constitutional mandate, and disrupts the law-making framework of the entire country. Hence, the 'No work, no pay rule' may, in my opinion, help remedy this lacuna.
The opposition claims that this move world be a disproportionate punishment in response to causing disruptions in the Parliament. It is important to understand here that the principle of 'no work, no pay' is not just punitive in nature, but works on the principle of compensation as well. People are compensated for productive contribution. When there is no productive contribution, there is no compensation in return. Applying this rule to the Members of Parliament today would makes sense as it would ensure that only those who productively participate in the proceedings of the house will be awarded salary and vice-versa. 
In this context, I am reminded of a famous statement made by Lord Denning (former judge in the House of Lords) in one of his judgements, "I ask: is a man to be entitled to the wages for his work when he, with others, is doing his best to make it useless? Surely not. Wages are to be paid for services rendered, not for producing deliberate chaos."
We must debate the merits of the principle of 'No work, no pay'. If it is applicable to every working class citizen of our country, must it then, not be applicable to our law makers as well? I ask this question, because I believe that as law makers, we must justify everything including our salaries.(Poonam Mahajan is a BJP MP from Mumbai)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            First time I came to know that MPs work for their salary. I thought they are blessed to have it as their birth right. Afterall they are servant of public. They have been sent to the parliament to represent the people and exploit the nations resources.

                            It is despicable what these MPs are doing. But BJP started this trend and paralysed UPA 2 (be it in FDI etc.) and Dr.MMS's second round of reforms. Now when it happens to them they talk about morality of parliamentarians. They let Anna Hazare and Kejiriwal make a mockery of Parliament with lokpal bill (God knows what happened with that cos both seem to be in hibernation since) as if it was UPAs obligation. No lokpal has since been set up or functioning. Everyone is sleeping literally. Now with this ludicrous land acquisition bill which let's government take any piece of land without the consent of owners with no good remorse and  entirely benefits corporate interests like Adanis and Ambanis with their projects. No one give a rats attention about farmers who constitute the 50% of India's workforce and think they should sort themselves out? Let's please get out of this cloud cuckoo land we are in since May 2014. Nothing has changed except a different government is governing us.

                            This is fine, but can this lady please make sure that "NO WORK,NO PAY (&amp; NO SUBSIDIZED CANTEEN FOOD) " is adopted and incorporated in to the Law/Rule book immediately? If an Ordinance can be issued for the crucial LAB which is in a limbo because of the unruly behavior of certain political Parties and their MPs in the LS &amp; RS, why can't this rule be adopted and introduced forthwith? Can the author please clarify? What is the stumbling block? As I commented on the same subject yesterday, I would also recommend, along with the above rule, an additional heavy monetary penalty on the unruly/errant MP but also on the Political Party to which he/she belongs! It is perfectly alright to have a different view point on a subject, but it must be debated on the floor of the Parliament/Assembly. It is time to teach these useless MPs a lesson.Tax payers should now write directly to the President of India, the PM, Speaker of LS, Chairman of RS and the Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister to immediately impose the 'NO WORK, NO PAY + INDIVIDUAL PENALTY + PENALTY ON THE POLITICAL PARTY TO WHICH THE MP BELONGS.

                            No work no pay must be implemented and as Anand Sharma said it should be there from 2004 to till date. As both the parties are alike.earlier BJP used to do it and now congress is doing it.They give a damn about National interest and people.These politicains who merely live in subsidies and dont pay tax dont even bother the loss incurred by parliament each minute. A 130 year old party doing tit for tat with BJP keeping developement at stake.shame on all of 'em. nest time if congrss comes to power BJP will do it and so on it will go.Both the parties are shamigly exposing each others scams. Alas, we dont have any option...

                            The application of No Work No Psy may not be entirely applicable to the elected Members of Parliament. MPs are expected to protect the interest of their electorates. Sometimes these MPs are expected to voice their objections vociferously and this cannot be deemed as disruptions and hence no work no pay cannot be applied. On occasions, brute numbers may be against other MPs. These days the disruptions are forced due to ideological reasons. These things are to be discussed, debated and sorted out. Mere suspensions and making them ineligible to participate will not be in the best interest of democracy. It is always advisable to go for agreements by engaging in continuous deliberations and convincing arguments. I am happy this young Member of Parliament, daughter of legendary Pramod Mahajan is taking up disruptions in parliament in a very positive manner. She could have advocated these thoughts when her party was in opposition.

Next session of parliament , do not know how he will skip that one. As other citizens of India do not get paid for absentism , MPs should also not get pay. If they misbehave then they should be brought to their knees. They have already lodged their protest for one week, they should not carry it further and start working for people, who have elected them to solve peoples problem and not to go after individuals and deprive citizens of their rights.

                            The principle of dies non is ancient and literally means a day on which the judiciary does not function. In employment or labour matters it means a day on which duty has not been performed. It translates as no work, no pay. Poonam Mahajan is right. When you are under suspension, you are not doing your duty. Why should you be paid for not doing your duty?
