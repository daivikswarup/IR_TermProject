Headline::::'Congress Did It Too' Is a Lame Excuse, Kejriwal



DateTime::::2015-08-16T16:44:00+05:30




                                "But the Congress did the same" as a justification for all their own wrongdoings unites both the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP government in Delhi and the Narendra Modi-led government at the centre. It is not only the lamest of all excuses, it is also an electoral oxymoron. Both won not because people saw something special in them, but because people wanted to defeat the Congress, and hoped to see in them something different from the Congress. They won because they appeared to be effective in their opposition to the Congress. Both slammed their way to power. And today, both use the so-called mistakes of the Congress as an excuse for their own.
When Arvind Kejriwal gets shamed by social media for getting school children to flash cards with his name at Independence Day celebrations in a Delhi stadium, his back room boys pull out undated pictures of similar formations with Sheila Dikshit's name and another with the name of Lieutenant Governor Najib Jung. These undated and unsourced pictures became Arvind's excuse to do the same. Let us assume for a moment that it may have been done when Ms Dikshit was in power. Why did it never get noticed then and why did it lead to such furore now?
It is Arvind Kejriwal who made breaking news out of otherwise simple concomitants for senior government functionaries like accommodation and red beacons and PSOs (personal security officers). If people judge him with a different yardstick now it is because he had claimed he was different.
If Sushma Swaraj faces uncomfortable questions on why she helped a fugitive, her excuse is 'the Congress had helped Warren Anderson in fleeing the country'. Here of course, she conveniently - or perhaps deliberately - forgets the role played by her colleague Arun Jaitley as Law Minister in the Vajpayee government. On September 25, 2001, Jaitley had opined against Anderson's extradition - 'It is not the case that Mr Anderson committed any act that led to the direct result of the leakage of gas and the consequent loss of lives and injuries.....there is no evidence that Mr Anderson had knowledge of design defects and violations of safety requirements, and yet he failed to take proper remedial measures."
Let us for a moment accept that all accusations of Sushma Swaraj against the Congress are true. Does a counter question amount to an answer? Just because the Congress may have done something improper, is she free to protect the interests of a man facing grave charges of financial misconduct? People reject a government based on perceived mistakes committed by them. If they have voted the BJP to power, is it fair that someone as senior as Ms Sushma Swaraj cites mistakes purported to have been committed by the Congress to condone her own? Arun Jaitley blames the UPA for not issuing a Red Corner Notice to bring back Lalit Modi or filing cases under FEMA (foreign exchange laws) and not under PMLA (money laundering laws). When the Delhi High Court restored Lalit Modi's passport in August 2014, what stopped the Enforcement Directorate under Arun Jaitley from filing an appeal? The authority to issue a notice of any color rests with the administrative ministry. If the UPA government failed to do so, why did it take 14 months and pressure from the opposition (which took a toll of crucial legislative commitments) and the media for this government to issue a Red Corner Notice against Lalit Modi?
Sushma's other excuse for helping Lalit Modi was that the Congress Party had helped Ottavio Quattrocchi escape. The fact of the matter is that on June 9, 2007, the extradition request by the Indian government was rejected by an Argentinean court on the grounds that his arrest warrant was based on unsubstantiated accusation and was arbitrary. The CBI ended up paying the legal fee of Quattrocchi, accused of being a prime player in the Bofors scam. When the then CBI director, Vijai Shankar, was asked if he was embarrassed by the order of the El Dorado Court, he replied "...Mr Arun Jaitley (as Law Minister in the Vajpayee cabinet) had prepared a weak case".
In their desperation to come to power, anti-Congress forces hurl wild allegations and then find it extremely difficult to take any case to its logical culmination.
For 17 years, anti-Congress forces used Bofors as their key plank against the party. In his rallies, VP Singh would go around showing a piece of paper with a number scribbled on it claiming it was the number of the Swiss bank account in which the money received from the Bofors kickbacks was parked. He promised that he would send Rajiv Gandhi behind bars in 100 days. When he became the Prime Minister, not only could he not deliver anything substantial on Bofors, he brought in the Mandal Commission report to shift the focus of the discourse from Bofors to caste-based reservations.
In 2004, when the Delhi High Court cleared the name of Rajiv Gandhi of any involvement in the Bofors case, the Congress Party demanded an apology from those who had sullied his image. In response to the demand, VP Singh innocently claimed he had never named Rajiv Gandhi in Bofors - this after tainting the Congress Party and Gandhi family to further his ambitions.
Instead of hiding behind the so-called errors of omission and commission of the Congress Party, the Modi government should perhaps do some research and emulate those policies of the Congress that have made the people send it to the Raisina Hills ten out of sixteen times.(Pawan Khera is a political analyst with the Congress party.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            i just can't understand what's all the big fuss about. i  neither support AAP nor Congress. Arvind has regretted anf said he id not aware of such practice and vowed to stop. so what is the issue? when u accuse someone despite being apologetic he will naturally become aggressive or defensive. better vongress morons stop making mountain out of a molr and criticize Arvind on his governance rather than on petty issues. This press and mrfia too should mature and concentrate on good governance issues.

                            Yes, the people sent the Congress to power many times. The question is, what did they get out of it? Poverty, backwardness and corruption. Apart from a moth eaten dynasty, sycophancy and inefficient governance. When you blame the BJP and AAP for parroting the same excuses as the Congress for their actions or lack of, does quoting Jaitley reduce its culpability? Both Anderson and Quattrocchi escaped from this country when the Congress and specifically the Gandhi family, was ruling. The entire country is well aware of corruption in the Congress, even at the highest level. Fig leaves and red herrings will not make a difference. Speak, and clearly, for yourself.

                            When you can't find faults with AAP's performance, then these small mistakes become very important issues. He's the only one working on witness protection and whistle blowers, while dozens of witnesses are systematically being killed in many scams. He's working on improving education and health in a big way, the mohalla clinic is something that can easily be replicated in all states - a model of efficiency and cost effectiveness. So you can't find faults there, and you have to pick on him even when he's promised to stop a shameful tradition. Bad loaers can never work as good opposition.

If that is a crime she is ready to accept punishment. Congress is wrong in demanding her resignation and stalling all the important bills in parliament for this silly reason. Congress should go to court with evidence and get her arrested as was done in case of Raja etc.

                            By hiding the fact that Arvind said he was not aware of it, this author has wasted precious thoughts on a matter that does not merit anything. Yeah, ofcourse, pawan khera wants to destroy the image of Arvind. But he need not do it. Arvind will do it himself..

                            If Ms. Swaraj has commiitted a crime,let congress take legal action against her. If what she did does not qualify to be a crime but demands her resignation on moral grounds, it must be left to her. morality can not be imposed on any one. But on that pretext stalling the legislations which are badly needed for the welfare of 125 Cr Indians, it is not a democratic act by any stretch of imagination. Congress has defeated the people once again..First by looting public wealth through several scams and now by preventing legislations which could kick start sagging economy of millions of common man. Is this how a 125 year old democratic party tries to remain relevant in politics?

                            It is usual for politicians to say that the other parties also did the same, easily forgetting that they have come to power on being different and not to do those things. GST, Landbill, aadhar etc started by previous govt. was strongly opposed by BJP, but now they want the support of Congress which is unfortunately not providing its own initiatives.

                            I want to know if AK was aware of such event before the function then it is AK's wrong. However we should consider the fact that apologising is a good gesture. One question to all ...are we all morally correct when it comes to our own personal lives. ......<br/>
Are we really supporting/following shri NAMO. I read somewhere in the news that NM wished AK on his bday.... I think there is no fight on personal grounds....it only that the Bihar elections are on front....each individual/ group/party will try to politicise       evry event whtr personal or polyical...its is game...

                            Pawan Khera seems to be misrepresenting the facts. The Congress Government's legal team did not take up the matter of extradition in time, before the Argentinian Court and then started fumbling about the translation of the documents and the case was dismissed on technicalities and not on merits.

                            BJP and AAP came to power citing Congress's failures and misdoings. To quote them as a justification means you are all the same and always approved their actions.

                            Writer being a congress analyst this type of opinions are expected. Even the title is given against AAP where as the 2/3 of the article talks about BJP. This shows nexus between Congress BJP and the paid media. Morons

                            This guy's arguments are the most stupid ever. First of all he should do his homework and see what Arvind kejriwal has said for the controversy. Without getting the basic facts right, he has written an article on it. Crazy it is!

                            Let us look at the pattern and the gravity of the incident. What Sushma has done is wrong, but does it matter so much attention. Is there a trend. Can we not allow a person to make an error of judgement. Also has Lalit Modi run away. He is back at UK. Do whatever you want to do.

                            Point what author wants to put forward is...AAP was suppose to different party unlike Congress or BJP. Then why they are repeating same mistakes what these parties did and tell "They did so". Hope AAP will disappear soon and AK as well. They are threatening to nation.   Shame on AAP and their supporters.

                            Writer is either Anti aap or doesn't want to read the statements. AK didn't give this as excuse. He said, he didn't knew about the routine and the evidence is that this routine was being done over the years. In fact he has stopped the practice once he found out.

                            Give me a break. This topic started with Arvind Kejriwal and AAP ; and then going on and on against BJP. I am not sure what is wrong with this nation... 60 years one party rules and no sooner there is a change people are hell bent on being so negative .... Come on... everyone knows BJP or AAP are not picture perfect ... they are Indians like any of us... We are not from heaven nor are they.... Yes lets pin point what is going wrong with non Congress parties but let us also appreciate their good doings...If such a negative journalism prevails I am sure India can never make any progress...

                            Warren Anderson is not directly involved in Bhopal Gas tragedy but  Union Carbide company's responsible person was Warren Anderson who has to compensate the losses of lives and all those who are still suffering because of that nerve damaging gas MIC but congress helped him to flee and even escorted to airport by than CM Arjunsingh resulting in no justice and no compensations to more than 25000 deaths and even double who survived with life time disability after 30 years so it is 1000 times serious than lalitgate.

                            Lalit Modi must be brought back to India and red corner notice must be issued.I wonder why he was allowed to flee in 2010 ? What congress  was doing and what congress did than after till 2014 ? This is the routine story of 68 years in India. Government in power always let something happen and suddenly waking to find the culprit only after he safely flees with the help of corrupt politicians or beurocrate  or police. Than the whole story becomes election wining point,media get material of getting TRP but people's work is not done and parliament and lagislative  work is stalled for sessions after sessions.
