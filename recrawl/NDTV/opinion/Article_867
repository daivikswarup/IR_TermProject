Headline::::An 82-Year-Old Watched Her Son's Murder By a Mob



DateTime::::2015-10-05T00:14:00+05:30




                                "I do not want to stay here. I don't want to live here." She was holding my hands. She was crying. It was a very small room. We were surrounded by TV cameras and press reporters. There was a lot of commotion and I could barely hear her. Poverty was writ large on the walls and furniture over there. She was sitting on a cot and I was trying to console her. Her younger son was talking to Arvind Kejriwal who was sitting next to me. I was looking at her face. Her right eye was swollen and black. She is 82.
Monday night changed her life forever. On that night, a mob instigated by some boys attacked her home, identified her 50-year-old son and a grandson, and started beating them up. When she tried to save them, she was also brutally attacked. She hid herself in the bathroom. The door was broken and she was badly thrashed. She told me she saw her son being beaten with a sewing machine. His head was smashed with bricks. When he became unconscious, his body was dragged out of the house and taken to a corner of the village. By the time the police reached, both father and son were in critical condition. The father, Akhlaq, was declared dead at the hospital and the son is still fighting for life in the hospital.
She could hardly open her right eye. I wanted to know if she could see through that eye. She nodded in affirmation. She told me her whole body was aching; she couldn't show me where she had got injuries. She was willing to forget every pain if she could get back her son but that was not to happen. She swore by the Almighty - they did not eat beef as was rumoured. In fact, her younger son told us, they prefer vegetarian food. I could feel her body shivering and she was starting to get delirious. She was again repeating "I don't want to live here. Take me away." I had no answer.Her other three sons and daughter had also come. They were talking to Arvind one by one. The younger son was saying that at this moment they do not want to leave this place, but they would certainly decide after some time. I could see pain on their faces. They were trying to be brave. The oldest son and eldest brother of Akhlaq told us that their family had been living there for the last 200 years. He had heard that his great grandfather had also been born in that very same village. They were only two Muslim families amongst hundreds of Hindu families, yet they had never felt threatened. In fact, when they had to go out to earn a living, they would leave the womenfolk there without any worries. We were told that there was a lot of respect for the Akhlaq family. One of the brothers used to work as a plumber and due to the nature of the job, he had been to almost every house in the village and he recognised everybody in that area. He could not understand why his family was targeted. They all were looking for an answer.
I wish I could tell them that it was not their fault. Akhlaq had not committed any crime. Cow meat is banned in Uttar Pradesh. And even if he had eaten beef, the law should have taken its course. Citizens had no right to form a mob and kill somebody just because his eating habits were not liked by a few. This is the most dangerous thing that hasÂ  happened in the recent past. It was like the killing of Kalburgi in Karnataka and the murder of Govind Pansare in Maharashtra. The crime of both these gentlemen was that their views were not liked by a few fringe Hindu organisations. They had no argument to counter them. So they decided to shoot them. More dangerous was the attempt by a few to justify the killings and to threaten a few more.
I had grown up in a democratic society and was always told that per our constitution, as citizens, we are free to choose any religion, can express our views without any fear or favour, and can eat whatever we feel like. If people are killed just because one does not like some one's views or does not like one's eating habit, then there is no future for this country. These are fundamental rights ordained by our constitution; secularism is central to our democratic set up and when such incidents take place, every right-thinking person is outraged and our basic belief is shaken.
But unfortunately, I must confess that I believe that a new environment has been deliberately created for the last so many years (to provoke or allow these sorts of attacks). In fact, such incidents are actually justified. Two Cabinet Ministers - Mahesh Sharma who said that the "incident was the result of some misunderstanding" and Sanjiv Balyan, an accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots - had no remorse. Mr. Balyan said the "UP government should be sacked for cow slaughter". Social media platforms are full of people who rejoiced over the killing.
During our visit to the village, we were confronted by a few whose tone and tenor can't be appreciated. A young woman had such bad words that I am afraid I can't repeat here. She was more concerned about a "rumoured" cow slaughter than the murder of a fellow village man. She even questioned the place of the burial of Akhlaq. Her tone was threatening. These were the women who attacked the media, specially TV crews, before we reached there. I saw a few men roaming around with a threatening swagger. I found out that not all of them belonged to the village. They were highly political. They jeered Arvind. We decided to ignore them.
But what I can't ignore is the fact that since that incident, no one from the village had visited the Akhlaq home and no one bothered to know if they are ok. What I can't ignore are the cries of that 82-year-old woman and the words uttered by her younger son that "it was not the killing of his brother but the killing of a centuries'-old trust".
It was this trust which had made India what India is today, a secular-democratic-liberal country and for that it is looked at with awe by the world community. It was because of this trust that Akhlaq and his family and crores of Muslims decided to stay back in India when they had an option in 1947 to migrate to Pakistan. But today there are forces that are hell bent on breaking that trust. Because there are forces that are not willing to learn lessons from history and want to convert India into another Pakistan. I wish I could say to that mother "Don't worry, this too shall pass, you stay back..." But those threatening eyes are still following me and I am not sure such an incident will not happen again.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Stop politicizing the issue.  Apologize and apologize more as a human being.  Don't give political colors to it and keep your Kejriwal out of it.  The young generation is seeing through your crocodile tears.  The people across the nation are disgusted by the incident.  Mother India mourns it's son.  Our heads hang in shame.  <br/><br/>
 We hope and pray justice is served and the perpetrators of such a heinous crime are duly punished under the laws of the country.

                            English media has upheld the cause of victim and his family over the unfortunate incidence happened in dadri. i have been seeing passionate blogs, debates and editorials. i am sure values of secularism are going to be upheld by the crusaders of secularists in English media.sadly these secularists go underground while taking up the cause of kashmiri pandits who were uprooted and thrown out of valley by secular muslims of kashmir valley. no debates , no editorials, no blogs in favour of kashmiri pandits by these secularists. perhaps definition of secularism in this country is as hollow as these so called secularists are. these empty barrels make huge noise, divide society further and do nothing worthwhile either for victim or for society as a whole. perhaps time for english media to reflect upon this as it has become item number of bollywood in handling sensitive issues like this.

                            Dear Arvind Kejriwal, About 25 people died in Delhi from dengue (most of them kids), u never had time to visit any one of the family. Now a man has been killed outside your state for eating beef in a state where law &amp; order is grossly improper &amp; u are the first one to go there..<br/>
The fact is for your state you have always Modi &amp; MCD To blame &amp; you are going to other states just to strengthen AAP....

Apparently, all such crimes against minority has complicit and silent approval from PM, BJP leadership. History will surely judge these crimes very critically.

                            It is so sad to see that a mob can take law into their hands and the sadder part is that people at responsible positions do not condemn it and even the public do not condemn the act.<br/><br/>
Except the law enforcing officers, no one in India is allowed to take law into their hands.<br/><br/>
Whatever be the reason can a group of people thrash and kill someone . I condemn this with the severest of words in my vocabulary. <br/><br/>
This case must be passed to a fast track court, all the culprits including the kingpin behind this must be arrested and tried in a time bound manner like the Nirbhaya case.<br/><br/>
The politicians who incited with their comments must also be arrested under whatever sections of law that is applicable

                            @ndtv: without taking away that whatever happened was extremely sad, undesirable and wrong, the way these politicians and also the media(especially you) are trying to take advantage and blowing things out of proportions is extremely shameful.<br/>
Look at the no. of headlines and opinions that u have on this issue.(and also the anti BJP and RSS brigade that u have)<br/>
The more u try to give air to this issue, the more communal hatred u are inciting.<br/>
The recent surge in this RSS ideology has also to do with the the constant ignoring of the majority and appeasement of the minority community over the yrs by the pseudo- secular parties and biased reporting by the media ignoring acts done by the minority community(eg. Godhra carnage) and blowing the retaliatory acts out of fear(eg. Gujarat Riots) totally out of proportions.<br/>
U need to learn which news to display and which not to. U definitely have a role to play in not jst maintaining the peace and order in the country but also inducing communal harmony.<br/>
Be a more responsible and unbiased network.U can learn from Zee media.

What to say buddy, Lalu is not wrong in his statement that Indians eat beef when go abroad.  Though eating is a personal matter, but Mr. AK and Mr. Ashutosh doing at Akhlaq's home.  Shame on you guys so many dengue deaths in Delhi itself, do something here, death is death either by illness or by a mob, don't fool people.

Hypocrisy unlimited.... However, events of dadri are most unfortunate but please do not politicise the issue and add fuel to fire for political gains of your master

                            It is sad what happened. No doubt and it is deplorable and should be avoided. Absolutely. But then in Delhi millions of people are suffering pollution, dengue and other health hazards. Other than issue an apology through your news article, are you really doing anything about these issues in Delhi? You have earned yourself 67/70 in the assembly. What excuses do you have to not do your job now? You promised a refreshing change in your way of governance.....change alright but it is a horrible brand of politics worse than some of the parties already in the fray. I think AAP is better served by minding their own business and doing something worthwhile for the people of Delhi other than give subsidies and sensationalizing every incident in the country.

Now a man has been killed outside your state for eating beef in a state where law &amp; order is grossly improper &amp; u are the first one to go there..<br/>

                            Agreed Mr. Ashutosh, but did the party do the same when the farmer was instigated to carry out his suicide bid. How many party leader did visit the dengue dead family in Delhi to pacify them. It actually looks funny to see, the backyard is not clean and trying to clean the neighbors back yard. AAP was elected for cause, but looks like the association with Nitish/Lalu/Congress has take us back. So is some decision like the advertisement on the leaders and party with huge cost. It actually does not segregated AAP from other parties. Dengue is at its heights in Delhi and rather doing a collective effort, blame games and atatcks on people and individuals is what we see.

Thought this is an honest confession of AAP failure to control the outbreak.. But neah... u r same ghisa pitta record,, blame center and modi for a single death giving it communal color while blind eye towards ppl suffered due to dengue<br/><br/>
Ashutosh....accept you are a mass murdered by being represented of AAP which is directly responsible for death of civilians due to Dengue, which you and your party fails to controll. Accept it and ready to face trial. Have some shame.

Mob does not become violent in a flip of coin. At times, sustained teasers to the individual's sentiments erupt in the form of mob. <br/><br/>
Generally, non-violent vegetarians choose to be violent either in self defence or to defend their faith. Out of proportion compensation to the victim of accident is another teaser to the majority.

                            These AAP/Cong must be thrown away from Indian politics for a peaceful life for the country. Every incident they calculate a political opportunism.

                            secular-democratic-liberal country? it is you kind of people spoiling it in today's India by injecting hatred in the communities. Why? what happiness do you get by doing this? Let people lead their life. just because you know few bits of English you cannot write what you like and create confusion in the minds of people. we need some soothing support and justice to the family. If the mob is identified, they should be brought to book, no matter which community they belong to. Not just in this case, but all hate cases. <br/><br/>
BTW, I think you and your part should focus on Delhi and deliver governance there. But you seem to be doing everything else but that. Focus man focus on your job.

                            Incident itself is shameful and henious, but even more shameful is the way political parties looking this incident as and this includes every single party.
