Headline::::Why Aren't Scientists Returning Awards?



DateTime::::2015-10-20T15:56:00+05:30




                                Well, I may or may not qualify as a writer but I am very certain that I am a committed reader. I am as sure of this as I am of the fact that Nayantara Sahgal wrote Prison and Chocolate Cake or that the BJP won the Indian General Elections of 2014 with an unprecedented majority. And now we have another unprecedented moment. Impressive numbers of distinguished writers and artists have been returning their national awards in protest against recent horrors such as the Dadri lynching and the cold-blooded shooting of the Sahitya Akademi award-winning writer MM Kalburgi. From my perspective as a common or garden variety of reader, the sort who dives into a book without thinking to check whether it has won an award, I'd therefore like to raise a couple of naive questions. How is the voice of the writer different from that of the ordinary citizen who might well experience a similar disquiet? Also, how is it that we have not so far had a single case of a scientist returning his or her national award although we may infer that the murder of free-thinking rationalists would upset scientists just as much as writers?
Surely it would be absurd to argue that writers feel more strongly than others the wrongs done to their fellow citizens or that they have more moral authority. It would be equally strange, I believe, to maintain that the politics of awards do not apply to prizes in the sciences. Yet, one group of national awardees, the writers, has spoken up strenuously. The other, comprising scientists, has not. Why? If the spate of Award-wapsi is a 'motivated protest' by persons who have been patronized by the Congress or the Left, that would be as true of the scientists. Why then have few, if any, scientists protested publicly? Are they immune to motivation?
I suggest that, as postcolonial inheritors of the British system of education, we return to CP Snow's memorable distinction between the 'two cultures' of the sciences and arts. Snow's thesis is typically invoked when there is talk of 'culture wars', as in our country today. His specific conjecture was that the UK system of education made too sharp a distinction between these streams, wherein the humanities were unduly privileged to 'speak for' the culture, while the sciences, despite their powerful intellectual contributions, constituted a place of cultural silence. He pointed out that ignorance of Shakespeare was considered a social lack but this snobbery did not appear to extend to a parallel ignorance, say, of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. In short, there was a deep, incipient 'intolerance' in British society.
This was not an intolerance based on class, race and other 'real' enmities. It was sustained and mutual mistrust in the realm of ideas. People in the humanities and social sciences seemed licensed to hold forth on cultural issues; scientists not. Snow believed that this schism in the educational system had greatly hurt his mid-fifties British culture. We must ask the difficult question, then: does it equally diminish ours in twenty-first century India? My view is that the recent and rare concerted action we have witnessed in the arts and social sciences has opened up a new cultural space.  
A year or so ago, I attended a memorial meeting in Delhi for the rationalist Narendra Dabholkar a qualified medical doctor, a scientist whom I did not know at all but had read about. I went because I respected him for robustly attempting to bring in laws against superstition and spurious magic in his native state of Maharashtra. Like so many others, I was appalled at the brutal gunning down of this man simply because he held certain views, views that were apparently not anti-religion at all but more against the exploitation of religious faith. On that occasion, I recall that there were barely 50 or 60 people in the room and even fewer of Delhi's glittering intelligentsia.
Today, this notable indifference seems, miraculously, to have been reversed.   
As not just writers but, most recently, 73 sociologists have spoken in one voice to condemn what they see as a growing atmosphere of intolerance in the country, the new space coming into being is what we may call "collective dialogue for action". It is no longer a matter of us, the so-called 'professional protesters' in the humanities and social sciences, signing all sort of petitions that, as far as we know, have limited effects on the ground. Something more fundamental is happening.
The media today, like it or not, brings to all of us news of ghastly hate crimes, of child rapes, of vigilante violence, with an everyday certitude that cannot but shock and dismay. In this 'in your face' or 'in your Facebook' world, we are thus being systematically forced as a collective to confront the big questions again. What does it mean to be Indian? Are our vaunted values of "pluralism"
and "toleration" just meaningless words for millions of India's citizens at the awful receiving end of religious, caste and gender prejudice? And, btw, what are we going to do about it? For long, the cocooned middle-classes paid scant attention to this last question. That, to my mind, is what seems poised to change.
Writers from Sadat Hasan Manto to Harishankar Parsai to Kamala Das have always been fearless in their social critiques and I have nothing but unqualified admiration for those who have returned their awards in the past month or so. But we do need to ask about their present readership.
Today, we have a generation that reads literary books, if at all, alongside 1) chillingly savage news items; 2) seductive advertising slogans of instant success; 3) an educational ideology that emphasizes the superior status of the sciences. That's precisely why we need the scientists to speak in a society that has huge respect for them. Not necessarily by returning awards but by explaining to an India with a startlingly young demographic how scientific achievements and aspirations also promote the dynamic ideal of an egalitarian and tolerant India. This is a sort of moral obligation. Once, we had a green revolution by India's scientists which made us proudly self-sufficient in food grains; today, we must not be distracted by the false colours of a pink revolution. Much more imperative is to try and bridge that old 'two cultures' divide. For there could be no better demonstration of our abidingly syncretic and open culture.
The brute fact is that we live in a country that has not been able to ensure the precious gift of being able to read for nearly a fourth of its citizens. Pious sentiments notwithstanding, no political establishment has made it their first priority to create an educational environment where the discussion of ideas, whether in the sciences or humanities, is paramount. We have failed to bring up our young in an atmosphere where even the right to life is assured, let alone 'free speech'. Today, we face the consequence of this long-standing neglect of the basics of a humane education. In our 'tiffin-box paradigm' of social existence, our personal lives, our political selves and our spheres of work have occupied separate compartments. But today it appears that we cannot any longer peacefully eat our tiffin in our individual corners should we so choose. The contents of our hitherto private tiffin-boxes are now open not only to scrutiny but to ghastly routines of grab-snatch-and-spit-in-your-face. The metaphor of prison and chocolate cake seems back, albeit in desi idiom. How should we react?
The common reader, increasingly young and often confused, looks to its intelligentsia, right-wing and left, scientists and artists, to open their mouths - and hearts - at this critical juncture.

                            Because scientists don't apply flippant rationalism and know how to differentiate between data and noise. So u r not gonna influence any scientist despite how much noise u produce. The article by Rupa subramaniya on newslaundry clearly exposes that there is no evidence to suggest that there has been any increase on communal violence , except in the brains of liberals who were ready to leave India in case Modi got elected

                            Surprising idiocy. Why did these Litraturist did not return their awards when Delhi Gang rape happened... Honestly what has Dadri to do with Central Govt... and top of it.. why has Dadri became reason for Litraturist to return the awards... there is no connection..., As per Media or Anti-Modi politics When Gujarat had 2002 then it was Gujarat Govt Law and order issue, When Muzzaffar nagar happened it was BJP MLA issue in UP and when Any other incident happens it is Modi reason.. Come on guys can u all please be sensible.. and not connect every incident to PM. what has PM to do with this incident. There are many such incidents takes place across the world. I did not see any media trying to pull other Govt so much.. why is that? Media can u stop polarising situation please.

                            I think the media needs to focus less on bollywood celebrities and their trivial pursuits, and help build a culture where achievers from the arts and sciences are celebrated as real role models. The path between them and the common Indian, strewn with elitism and esotericism, needs to be cleared up, so that their ideas and achievements can truly inspire, and not just amaze.

                            Instead of returning awards why not talk to ppl who killed the innocent rationalists. Police may do their job. but rationslists should visit the orgn hqs  like vhp or bajarng dal and try to explain them they are not against them and explain them the theory instead of confronting them. Try and change the heart of criminals.If they have felt hurt by rationalists ideas explain them that is not their motive to hurt them. I feel those who do crime they are uneducated to understand the rationale behind the idea.

                            Here is the answer:<br/>
Science is based on math and logic. Logically speaking, if violence against a rationalist is to be protested, by now all awards should have been returned. Also, a scientist would ask why only a rationalist's murder for his belief should be protested and not a non-rationalists.<br/>
Then, science is a lot about prediction. For example, at this rate if resignation comes, after 4 years, there will be no more awards to be returned and violence can continue indefinitely without protest.<br/>
That is why, Kalidasa couldn't put us on moon but Kalam could.

                            Its because writers feel they are the mouth peace of the society. Like media they do communicate via their writings. It would have been more neutral if they have done similar actions when others religion persons are being killed and side lined as well. I can quote several real life examples. However everyone seems to make a noise only when it has a minority tag to draw milage probably

                            Simple explanation. Scientists are not emotional and also amenable to reason.  whereas writers are emotional and sentimental. They believe what they espouse is the ultimate truth and nothing else is right. Also scientists don't have double standards.

                            At least 1 million farmers must have committed suicide in 60 years of Congress rule. Nobody bothered to return awards.<br/><br/>
1 million pandits chased out of Kashmir and still not allowed back. No awards returned.<br/><br/>

                            Because Scientists have brains and they have got awards for what they have done. Many of these so called authors are returning their award which they got by mistake or the award that they did not deserve. Late realisation but late is better than never. What they are doing is good thing.<br/><br/>
The government should now collect all these awards and give them to the right people who have done real contribution to Nation Building process through their writings.<br/><br/>
Remember, some of these authors had challenged that they will leave India if Modi came to power. They did not do so (which country will entertain them by the way) and now to gain some cheap publicity they are returning their awards (except the money LOL) They should actually return their awards to the Congress party who gave them the awards... not to Modi government. Modi should say we never gave you any award to return...

The comments were made by low ranked BJP leaders and all top leaders have condemned them roundly. I have not forgotten the statement " when a big tree falls. the ground will shake" from the PM to be in 1984.I do not know if he is the hero you worship. I have also not forgotten how Budhadeb Bhattacharys got Tasleema Nasreen shipped out of Kolkata overnight instead of restraining the bigoted goons of Kolkata.

Common man really doesn't worry about Dadri, Kulburgi, or Kashmir, he is well occupied by survival problems. <br/><br/>
A governemt who provides or accomidates these to a common man always win no matter another bombay or samjautha express happens<br/><br/>
Things happen and things are forgotten, its only media cirucus , again for the elite.

                            This "award returning" fashion has taken a grip because it does not cost those involved anything except a dusty trophy on their shelvess. No one is sure why they are indulging in this hobby - to show concern about attacks on fellow writers or about the murder in Dadri. Despite their "scholarship", they do not seem to know that law and order is basically a state subject and they should be attacking the governments concerned directly, rather than making token and irrelevant gestures against Sahitya Akademy. Or is it all politically motivated against the present central government? A very critical question, indeed!

Its better if all of them go to villages and serve farmers, rural people instead of wasting public time and pollute the peoples minds.Majority peoples concerns are suppressed continuously.These things happen in India only.

Almost all the scientists in India are government employees and you yourself being one must be aware of the conduct rules. And rationality can not be decided on the basis of your own choice to label something as rational because it suits you and your preferences. Religion is the biggest superstition and I am pretty sure you must be having an almighty to bank on to hear your prayers. Give him up and then write and I would listen.

The sad reality of India is that we are left with sub-standard scientific community that thrives with its "research" on largely plagiarized work from west. <br/>
Now to be fair there may be a few idealists who stay back to serve the country but those poor souls almost never get any recognition or award. <br/>

                            In my opinion scientists do need to seriously consider their moral and social obligations. In general scientists are more optimistic , that somehow the good will prevail, it could be because of the kind of discoveries they read about everyday. I remember Dr. Abdul Kalam , the way he approach his life after his prime years was a great inspiration for many of us in India. Hoping more scientists will be vocal like him and inspire the next generation.

It is not just the writers, everyone has a responsibility to join this growing resistance against the pernicious ideology of Sanatan India that the Sangh Parivar is forcefully unleashing.

                            They should return award because govt can make laws n punish criminals but responsibility for civic society lies in writer's pen. Growing intolerance in society is not govts fault. These award winners were unable to change the mentality of people they were unable to motivate people for communal harmony. They should return their awards because these awards were given to them as token of motivation so that they can contribute in formation of a civic  society. Actually they failed that's why they are returning awards nothing else.

                            Are you a scientist? No, you are a writer. That is why you have this type of strange logic. Writers mostly get recognition by political patronage. Therefore, it becomes their duty to shout for their masters. Very few writers  have got success for their voice (not shout) like Tagore, Rushdie etc. For scientist this is not the case. Their work is to unravel the truth and secrets of nature. It does not depend on any Cong, BJP, SP, TMC. Their work bears the same meaning in all regimes.

A science or a research institute is not FTII nor do BJP have anyone remotely educated to infiltrate science institutes. Given the fact that that the max they could do with the HRD is a 12 pass. Contrary to that the dean of a college needs to have a certain background. Hence since research fellows are not directly effected nor are bothered about high class RSS topics such as cows.<br/><br/>

                            During the previous regime, many incompetent and undeserving DRDO and CSIR Scientists got awards by following the policy of "You Scratch my back, I will scratch yours later". Example is, there are 40 to 50 DRDO/CSIR laboratories wasting Tax Payers hard earned monies. Senior Scientist of 1st lab will institute and confer an award on Senior Scientist of 34th Lab. 34th Lab Senior Scientist will confer another award on Senior Scientist of 6th Lab, who in turn will confer another award on the 1st Scientist. In this way, the cycle repeats itself. The one with the most awards will try for some higher awards using their Political connections. Hence, whether they retain or return the awards, it hardly matters. In World Rankings, these Scientists will lose their deposits.

The same question was posed when about a measly hundred US Indian academics affiliated with religious, humanities and gender studies, etc, wrote against the Prime Minister's visit to Silicon Valley, and got a scathing response from several thousand gainfully employed US Indian scientists and engineers and technologists who were actually doing something useful with their lives.

                            Ahem. Are these the same scientists who sat quietly when the leader of the largest democracy said that India has been doing Plastic Surgery from the days of the lord Ganesh?

                            one more interesting observation : English print and TV media makes more hue and cry for these issues.........Their one point agenda is to malign the image of india in front of the world..mostly hey shows negative news on their prime time........like FTII student strike, beef issue........<br/><br/>
i never heard these english media ever debating on the Kashmir Pandit issues, Amarnatyh yatra,Sikh riot issues, mumbai underworld etc......

                            First question why writers have not returned money associated with awards. A study shows 95% of them got awards during Cong tenure, some deserve while the others influenced. Now coming to scientists, they believe in proofs while writers goes by gut feeling, like your writings!

                            There are very few writers and sociologists in India who have any understanding of what it means to have a comparative study of civilizations. Neither do they have the ability or inclination to understand how ideas of modernity that they now tout so vigorously are simply opportunistic stances of an urban elite ( since the mid 19th century) with all the privileges of the modern urban-industrial system (including comfortably salaried govt. jobs at IITs and other colleges/universities). These writers and sociologists operate with intellectual frameworks that are completely Eurocentric. Since religion in Europe was entirely a matter of Christian faith with no rigorous metaphysical frameworks for understanding consciousness (unlike in the Indian sub-continent and much of Asia where ideas of 'karma', 'dharma' , 'yoga'etc. are rigorously developed over millenia through the teachings of numerous sages and saints), Europeans have a purely materialistic notion of 'rationality'. Most scientists in India (and other parts of Asia) know that this is deeply flawed. Hence they continue to hold on to deeply religious and spiritual convictions and traditions despite their training in 'modern science'. However, most so-called 'writers' and 'sociologists' in India have neither any deep understanding of 'modern science', nor do they have any genuine affinity for their own cultural roots. Hence the only politics they understand is of the most shallow kind (conveniently labelled 'Left-Liberal'), which also ensures that they are amply rewarded by the 'secular reward system' of the Western world.
