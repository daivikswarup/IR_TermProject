Headline::::Salman, Ma Ka Laadla Bighad Gaya



DateTime::::2015-05-11T02:38:00+05:30




                                The Baltimore riots threw up an unlikely heroine - a determined mother who chased an adult son and smacked him in public, before dragging him home. What was the young man doing to cause such distress to his enraged mom? Well, he had apparently picked up a few stones to throw at the police, who were trying to control rampaging mobs indulging in arson and rioting. The video went viral and overnight, the unknown woman was hailed as 'Mother of the Year' across social media platforms. What was her achievement? Well... she was acknowledged worldwide for doing the right thing; for correcting her boy... and possibly saving his life.
 
Globally, mothers sent up a cheer for the woman - she had done what they dared not with their own sons - discipline them.
 
As the world commemorates Mother's Day, this may be the perfect time for mothers across the world to ask themselves if they are doing 'the right thing' when it comes to their children.
 
It will be interesting to know how Salman Khan spent his Sunday. His devoted mother Salma had reportedly taken ill, unable to deal with the stress generated by her son's ongoing trial. She is lucky she is surrounded by her large family, and their enormous circle of friends and supporters.
 
Bollywood swiftly closed ranks during the crisis and protected one of their own. Whether the fraternity would have displayed the same level of solidarity had it been a lesser star than Salman is doubtful.
 
That's how showbiz works - particularly when there's a lot of money riding on a particular actor. Not so surprisingly, most initial reactions out of Bollywood revolved around the 200 or more crores apparently riding on Khan's movies. Bollywood appeared completely unconcerned about the victims of this terrible accident. Their collective indifference to the plight of those directly affected by the tragedy was the best indicator of their sensibilities.
 
This is where Salma Khan can play a key role. It is never too late for a mother to correct her child. A child of 50 - but still her child. Salma loves Salman. Salman loves Salma. Fine. It is time for Salma to ask herself a few tough questions. Where did she slip up while raising the boy who went on to become one of Bollywood's most bankable stars? Salman has been in and out of serious trouble most of his adult life. It's a bit silly to keep pointing to his good deeds and countless acts of charity while turning a blind eye to several misdemeanours that have blighted his turbulent existence for decades. He is fortunate to have gotten away scot free and unscathed so far. He has had a dream run, so to speak. But that can change in future.
 
Given his closeness to his mother, perhaps a heart-to-heart is overdue.
 
Salma is not alone.
 
Most Indian mothers behave in a ridiculous way about their precious sons. Culturally, this is how it is, has always been and perhaps will continue to be. Most Indian fellows are unapologetic 'Mama's Boys', and don't feel a bit embarrassed about it. Most desi moms blatantly discriminate between their sons and daughters and are shamelessly preferential in the way they raise male progeny. Society endorses and accepts this nauseating favouritism. Sons grow up with exaggerated feelings of self-importance.
Their special status within the family is repeatedly underlined, till they themselves start believing they are demi-Gods who can do no wrong.
Salman's emotional graph combined with a dicey track record both suggest he was raised to take most entitlements for granted. Privileges must have been presented on silver salvers from a young age, and the very idea of assuming responsibility for his actions may have appeared an alien concept to him and his family.
 
It's tough being a mother. Parental guidance is something that cannot be "taught''. Any mother's instinct is to protect a vulnerable child. Which is what Salma is doing. But what causes a child to grow up in a certain way? Why do mothers hesitate to correct their kids - sons in particular? Who teaches basic values to the young?  Should a mother's love be so irrational that even when a child steps out of line, there are zero repercussions... zero conversations... zero  consequences?
On some levels Salman never grew up. He didn't need to. His life was set.
Unfortunately, there are questions that need an answer this time. Whichever way this case goes, and at whatever speed, there will be those who won't forgive Salman. Nor will they forget the pain of the dead and the injured. That's called compassion. And compassion involves Being Human. Towards one and all.
I am sure Salma Khan will communicate this vital message to her beloved son.
It may save many other laadla betas in India from going down a dangerous road.(Shobhaa De is an established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator, who is considered an authority on popular culture.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Great article Shobha. It is the "mothers" of India that need to change their preferential treatment they give to their sons and in general their children across the world. If mothers instill good values since childhood and discipline whenever wrong and most importantly PRACTISE WHAT THEY PREACH, the world will become a peaceful paradise!

                            Hello there, well thank you for your rant which, let me point out, is sexist! Why oh why should only mothers discipline their wards? Perhaps his mother disciplined him but he became wayward after his father? And I don't like the word disciplining! Too much Foucaultian. Lets say parents should not make their children feel entitled and must not make them privileged brats! <br/>
And Ms.De, I don't expect you to contextualise the riots in Baltimore but I would urge you to push yourself in other directions. Comparing a privileged Salman to a completely disenfranchised black woman' son is stupid to say the least. When that woman hit her teenager, it was not to discipline him but she was scared of losing him. Black lives are so easily dispensible, and as a black you don't take panga with cops! If the same video would have gone viral, without the cops in the background, this woman would have been called names by the white Americans because parent's don't beat their children, it is legally offensive!

                            I agree. Indian mothers get so obsessed with their sons that they forget to discipline them or teach them how to respect others. <br/>
This is why most Indian men don't have a clue on how to respect women... and I'm speaking from experience.  <br/>
I've lived abroad for 12 years and this is the impression non-indians have of the men in the country, from reading the news of what's happening in India. Very worrying, the news needs to change and mothers can make that happen.

                            Reminds me of a story we were taught when we were children...A young Man had been caught in a daring act of theft and had been condemned to be executed for it. He expressed his desire to see his Mother, and to speak with her before he was led to execution, and of course this was granted. When his Mother came to him he said: "I want to whisper to you," and when she brought her ear near him, he nearly bit it off. All the bystanders were horrified, and asked him what he could mean by such brutal and inhuman conduct. "It is to punish her," he said. "When I was young I began with stealing little things, and brought them home to Mother. Instead of rebuking and punishing me, she laughed and said: "It will not be noticed." It is because of her that I am here to-day."<br/><br/>
"He is right, woman," said the Priest; "the Lord hath said:<br/><br/>
Moral of Aesops Fable: Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is <br/>
old he will not depart therefrom<br/><br/>
As for the movie fraternity, this is a farce community with the world not visible behind their dark goggles.

200 crores  worth movies will be made but hope the fans realize and don't go and watch his movies. Then He will become a flop hero. Salman and the film industry ( famous people)should know its only because of the people that they are famous.

                            I kinda agree and disagree at the same time. What if Salma did raise an obedient kid till he was 16 or 18 and then he went astray? Money and fame went to his head (obviously) &amp; gave him this (almost real) delusion of being invincible? Like they say in films, "Kissi ka baap bhi mujhe nahi rok sakta". Then why would Salma? Would a rich, spoilt son listen to his mother when his career kicks off in his 20s. I think, the mother and her sanskaar take a back seat while the son is busy 'gul khilaying' around town. None of us know Salma personally, so I think it's just wrong to judge her like that and point out that she's failed somewhere as a mother. I am NOT negating from the fact that in majority of Indian households, only sons are treated as khaandaan ka chiraag. :( Raise them right &amp; disown them if they don't mend their ways. The Khan family did the opposite &amp; held him tighter! Oh well..

                            It's not just about unapologetic Mama's Boys but in general guys who have got lots attention from females in families and surrounding. At some level, these guys never grow up and they take up everything for granted. Somehow, somewhere they have to pay for that along with those mothers and surrounding! In bigger picture, there is nothing like Scott-free. What goes around comes around! I strongly believe that Salman will pay if not today then in the long run.

                            So here it is - Shobha De is now above courts and HC and SC judges even. Every one wants to have a say above each other about what should Salman Khan do. And now Shobha De has some for his Mom too. (Classic was some author who herself uses filthy language and shows utter disrespect to everyone connected to Salman Khan in an so called Open Letter to Salman Khan). Shobha De has declared him Guilty and is expecting Salman to walk to Jail already even if it would be proved otherwise in HC or SC. Every India has a right to appeal in these courts because that is what Indian Constitution says. So are you saying that Salma should tell Salman that he should just go to jail without contesting in any courts. And so all the theories otherwise should not be believed. Ms De why don't you give such piece of advice to every person seeking bail. Appeal to the government to just do away with the law called Bail. Ridiculous I should say that you blame the film fraternity and his family and friends to come out in his support. C'mon guys who would want to go to jail if he has right to prove himself innocent and contest in courts. Don't teach Morales only to Salman's Mother or every Mother on Indian Soil just because there are huge differences in Police's investigation and arguable proofs. Just because Salman is celebrity or infact any known personality because he or she is judged by the whole world should just accept any sentence and go to prison to set example for whom - CRIMINALS? Are we expecting criminals to follow footsteps of Salman Khan on the soil where Mahatma Gandhi taught love and peace. Why do you all want to make such celebrities an example just to prove Law is blind and equal to all. For that matter every citizen is same under Indian Law and every one has right to bail or be punished. Why making such a BIG issue only about Salman Khan maam?

                            Salma has very little to do with this case.  All that is happening is entirely the doing of Salman.  He actually believes in the hype about the 'tough guy' image about himself whereas reality shows him to be anything but.  His alleged assault of Aishwarya seems to have been forgotten, his threats to Vivek Oberoi seems to have been forgotten, and his various drunken escapades seem to have been forgotten.  Bollywood has been full of crooks and the so called stars have always acquiesced or indeed collaborated.  It isn't a co-incident that Sanjay Dutt was up to his neck with the underworld, it isn't a co-incident that Bharat Shah is the front man for the underworld, it isn't a co-incident that Gulshan Kumar was murdered, it isn't a co-incident that Rakesh Roshan just about escaped with his life.  In a world full of crooks, little Salman is bound to think that he can get away with it as do all the crooks who are never prosecuted.

                            Hi shobha, while I agree with a lot of stuff mentioned by you, However I am not sure about this whole bias towards pne's kids being so gender centric. For a lot of parents when faced with a situation where the choice is between supporting what is right and letting their kids get penalized OR protecting their kids even if they are wrong , the choice can be very tough. Again I don't think this is desi thing as you put it and am sure spans across cultures. But yes stopping kids from doing wrong at an early age can potentially prevent such difficult choices to be made when they are adults

You remind me Jaya Bacchan who also speaks her mind but Amitabhji knows better that no one interested in truth. In the end it costs friends, it affects economy. In severe case brave person may become target of hate. Thats why on few ocasion Amitabhji apologised on behalf of his wife . So please be careful. Stay humble like Amitabhji. This is not a threat but just arequest.

                            Shobhaa has an interesting perspective here. Salman's actions are his own and no one else's fault, his self-destructive nature certainly stems from some where .. He is a person who did a lot of good, sure, But He messed up big. He needs to admit and own up to his faults. It is the right thing to do and perhaps the purest of bonds, a Mother is the best person to make him realize the difference between a being a boy and a MAN. It is not sexist of Shobhaa to bring mothers into this, as far as Indian culture is concerned, she is bang on.

                            I disagree with Shobha De. My point is; a 50 year old educated man does have the intelligence to judge what is right &amp; what is wrong. He does not need his mother to correct him. I only hope the courts serve justice &amp; nothing else.

                            @: Why are we blaming mothers??? ... Is it the responsibility of a mother along for the wrong doings of a child? Which world are we living in? Does a father play no role in bringing up a child?

                            Why leave daughters out. How about bringing up them well. A lot of mothers can use a lot of advice how to raise their daughters as well

                            I am glad someone(Shobhaa De) has the guts to speak her heart. Hope Salman learns before he preaches being human.

                            Was Sakman Khan driving? I don't think so, his driver was, Salman is paying because he is a celebrity, in a country like India police wants money and they are looking for reason to trap the wealthy, Salman happened to be in the car, he could have easily bribed the police and got away, Shobha Duh is again using Salman's celebrity status to create more mileage about her article, that's what Duh is capable of, parasite making money out of other's misery, writing nonsense most of the time.

                            First time madam an article written by you made so much sense to me. Justice should have prevailed even if the mother had not done her duties right. Alas our country is messed up beyond repair. People are getting the wrong message. This will be the beginning of a end we the people of india are writing ourselves.

                            Ok  - do you want does "Making a Salman exit from a car" mean..? It is a term used when the person sitting in the passenger seat of the car exits out of the drivers side because there is some cow dung or dog poo or some other muck out side the passenger side door. Or it could be that door is damaged in a accident....

                            Every author tries to communicate the 'moral' through their style and means a moral that is very unique to the time itself, should the fraternity be under such a pressure , creates a certain level of dismay, I expected more from some in particular , Deepika for instance, should you believe your friend is in the right you may but the verdict has not been passed yet and it's whole stalling which itself should have costed him over 5 years ... Legal system needs a lot of catching up
