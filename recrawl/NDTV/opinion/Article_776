Headline::::How Modi Government Turned Hurriyat Into Stars



DateTime::::2015-08-24T14:29:00+05:30




                                Now that the widely anticipated has come to pass, let me start with an admission of fact - and that is that I got a prediction wrong when I stuck my neck out suggesting talks between the NSAs of India and Pakistan would go ahead. I had mistakenly concluded that having invested political capital in Ufa (Russia), both the Indian and Pakistani Prime Ministers would make the necessary compromises that would pave the way for the talks to go ahead. Perhaps somewhere I allowed the subconscious hope to overcome the more realistic cynicism that should have been guiding my brain.
I'm disappointed that I was wrong because I had hoped that this would be the first significant step towards steady, consistent dialogue between two neighbors that have shared a very patchy relationship. The people of Jammu and Kashmir were hopeful that the dialogue process would mean the resumption of the ceasefire along the Line of Control and border, reduced infiltration, reduced violence and a move towards realizing the promise of Simla to resolve all outstanding issues including J&K. With the breakdown of communication, once again, the people of J&K will be the biggest losers. The effects of the last few days will be felt on the ground for quite some time to come.
It is a strange feeling to be disappointed for being wrong and disappointed for being right, both at the same time. I'm disappointed that I was right about what the Modi government's tough stand on the Hurriyat meant for the future of any India-Pakistan dialogue. I had argued (when the Foreign Secretary level talks were called off over a Pakistani invitation to the Hurriyat in 2014) that to make Pakistan-Hurriyat engagement the reason for calling off official government talks was short-sighted and completely unrealistic. To expect any Pakistani government, much less this Nawaz Sharif one, would completely rewrite their relationship with the Hurriyat is asking for too much. To make India-Pakistan dialogues conditional on this was to ensure that talks between the two governments would never achieve the continuity required. Sadly, the last few days have convinced me that I was right because Pakistan is not going to stop meeting the separatist leaders in Delhi, making any India-Pakistan talks in this country impossible.
Today, the Hurriyat must be a very satisfied bunch. They have struggled to find issues to keep themselves in the news. Other than capitalizing on the deaths of civilians during law and order disturbances, or to cross fire during an operation, there hasn't been much for the Hurriyat to peddle to the people of Kashmir. The high turnout in the Panchayat elections and respectable turnouts in the two elections of 2014 did the Hurriyat no favours.
A possible meeting between Pakistani NSA Sartaj Aziz and the Hurriyat leaders would, at best, have been a side show generating little or no interest. It is possible that because of the cancellation of the previously scheduled Foreign Secretary-level talks. there may have been a bit more interest than usual, but it would have been nothing like the amount of attention that was finally heaped on them when they became the reason for a nasty war of words between India and Pakistan.
Previous central governments have always turned a blind-eye to meetings between visiting Pakistani officials and Hurriyat leaders. They haven't liked the fact that these meetings happen, but wisely concluded that allowing them was the lesser of two evils. This time was dramatically different. The Modi Government in the centre, and the Mufti Government in the state ,joined hands to detain the Hurriyat leaders before they could leave for Delhi. In the game of one-upmanship, someone sitting in Delhi probably felt this would be the game-changer that would force Pakistan to pull out of the talks.
No sooner had they been detained than the backlash forced a rethink, and the cordon around the homes of the detained leaders was lifted. Suddenly, the sidebar was the headline news. The Hurriyat, which was at best the sideshow in this story, started to overshadow the key protagonists. It was now all about why they were detained, who ordered the detention, would they now be allowed to meet Sartaj Aziz, et cetera et cetera.
All this would have been comical if the games being played didn't have very serious consequences for a lot of people. The battle of the leaks from "highly-placed sources" was replaced by the press statements and then trumped by the press conferences addressed by Sartaj Aziz and Sushma Swaraj, both sides playing a very high stakes game of chicken to see who blinks first, each saying they are ready for an unconditional dialogue while happily setting conditions for the other to fulfill.
Pakistan wanted to discuss Kashmir and India wanted to discuss terror. What I don't get is how you can possibly discuss one without the other? What have we in J&K seen over the last 26 years if not terror? Did the Indian side really believe that they could discuss terror with Pakistan without Kashmir featuring in the talks? If the Ufa joint statement says that the two Prime Ministers "agreed that India and Pakistan have a collective responsibility to ensure peace and promote development. To do so, they are prepared to discuss all outstanding issues" how is discussing Kashmir violating the spirit of Ufa? India could have forcefully reiterated its position that Pakistan fulfill its commitment not to allow its soil to be used to support terror infrastructure directed at J&K, especially in light of the capture of terrorist Naveed in Udhampur. Pakistan would have repeated its same tired position about United Nation resolutions being the way forward. Nothing would change on the ground in the short term but at least we'd have the beginning of a dialogue process.
Instead we have a huge mess from where there is no easy exit. The problem with starting a process from the top down is that when things go wrong, there is nowhere to turn to. If the NSA talks were the result of a process that had started with talks between Foreign Office functionaries, or even Foreign Ministers, we could have turned to the two PMs to break the logjam. In this case  it is the two PMs who initiated this process, so we have no doors to knock on to try and get things back on track.
We seem to be in for another extended impasse between India and Pakistan. I very much hope I'm wrong but that hope is the heart speaking, the brain unfortunately disagrees.  (Omar Abdullah is National Conference leader and former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Unfortunately for the critics the Modi government has come out looking good for not blinking on the Hurriyat issue. The fact that the Modi government could pin Pakistan down to terrorism should be lauded and not criticized.

                            People with views like this are the reason of existence of entities like Huriyat.<br/>
Lesser of two evils?? where are you from? Thats how US created Taliban, Thats how Iran &amp; Iraq went to war. <br/><br/>
Terror &amp; Kashmir are connected. Terror &amp; India are connected, Terror &amp; US are connected, Terror &amp; Syria are connected. Do you hope India &amp; Pakistan discuss all these?<br/><br/>
Discussion on Terror means, discussion thats happening in India due to entities in Pakistan. Its not to discuss about Kashmir/Mumbai/Ahmadabad. Now enlighten me, what is that Pakistan want to discuss with Huriyat with regard to terror?<br/><br/>
Just because you are opposition, you dont need to oppose everything that the Government do. I hope, you get well soon.

                            This is quite an insight into the debacle that should have been better served if he could have addressed his partys failures in its years in power. The glee of congress and its cohorts at the mess is puzzling and in contrast to the opinion of the opposition and media in pakistan.

                            well// u seem right sir.. but einstein once said that "if you keep doing the same thing again and again, no new result will come".. i believe the modi govt is making new red lines and talking to pakistan in its own language, hoping to drive home some result or at least the point clearly that cross border infiltration or terrorists will not be allowed to blackmail in talks.. lets se.. w should not have so much inertia that we cannot understand change in methodology and tactics/strategy..

                            For once Omar is right. The separatists should be ignored and allowed to meet anyone they want to, including the Pakistani PM. You should be concerned with your stand on the Kashmir issue, and your strength to implement it. If you are not sure of yourself, you waffle. Why concern yourself with non entities? The so called separatists are not at all interested in Kashmir or Kashmiris. They want to make money from both the Indian and Pakistani governments, which they are doing very well indeed. This is something that the Indian Government is well aware of, as they are also paying them, besides providing security to them! How stupid can you get?

                            Pak wants to involve Hurriyat, India should involve the elected government of J&amp;K to balance the situation and progress the talks. Why are we hesitant to counter our Indian nationals with separatist movies (or hurriyat) with democratically accepted leaders of J&amp;K? Obviously elected leaders are have actual public mandate than what hurriyat claimed to be!

                            Now Abdullahs have become experts on Kashmir and international politics.Sr Abdullah ran like a mouse, when he saw kashmir is burning in 1990, to comforts of his in-laws house in London. When he returned Kashmir was already in flames which still are to be doused despite Sr Abdullah and Jr Abdullah stint in cm office of J&amp;K. Shamelessly now he tries to appear expert.<br/>
The Govt has done a diplomatic blast with Pak who like cowards were forced to withdraw from the talks. Regarding Hurriyat, its their governments who brought them to limelight..............

                            Even though there was greater peace with ceasefire and talks, the situation is to Pakistan's advantage. On one side they will engage in talks, on other side they will keep sending terrorists with no casualties to their armed forces. With current situation, they have to bear equal causalities in LoC and sooner or later India will give it back to them on terrorism. Hurriyat plays double game by supporting terror and it is important that they are out of the equation. They keep the valley on the boil and they need to be exiled. For better or worse let Government of India deal directly with the people without any brokers. The same with Pakistan. Pakistan is losing a lot just by focusing on Kashmir. All its neighbors have a complaint with it.

By redrawing conditions of talks with pakistan Modi has ensure that Shimla accord which rejected any 3rd party role in bilateral dialogue is respected.<br/>
Huriyat may look like hero's to you , but in long run their role will be wiped of in any formal discussion,<br/>
so better eat some brain enhancing tonic and stay away from ur friend rahul baba else 2 of you will soon takeover legacy from Lalu prasad in vomiting nonsense and entertaining us

                            It was an age old tradition supported by congress that whenever any official delegates come to india from paks they will meet huriyat and it become ritual. now the govt. has changed and in the right path to stop this ritual. india will talk with paks on their own terms , not be dictated by some antinational called huriyat. now in ajij's statement mention that india is behaving like a regional super power and paks understand this very clearly except congress and some chamcha party indulging vote bank politics. India is indeed a regional super power and soon to be Asian super power under Modiji's leadership.

                            Quickfix solution is desired but required home work is missing. Modi's autocratic style of functioning is to blame. Impasse is  inevitable. Pakistan's N.S.A. statement that Pakistan is nuclear power and knows how to defend itself, is a indication of Pakistan's future course of action.<br/>
Much for the joy  of Pakistan, India has minimized option for reconciliation. Pakistan's atom bomb is more a deterrent to India than India's to Pakistan is a perception which Pakistan wants to persist with.Pakistan's this ploy to escalate tension to the extent that international community intervene is next step of this Modi driven debacle of diplomacy. Modi should avoid handle foreign policy autocratically and take expert opinion in these highly super specialised subjects. Modi's this approach to achieve single handedly without consulting foreign office and foreign minister has made this debacle possible. Now, when Modi has snatched diplomatic defeat from jaw' of victory, he should learn lesson and improve to become inclusive and Democratic.

                            We may be re beginning the peace process with Pakistan which is a perennial problem pending the independence. I do not dig the past in putting my points of argument. There is word floating… "All talks including Jammu and Kashmir." I fail to understand one thing what we discuss about Kashmir with Pakistan, when it is wholly believed by every Indian that Kashmir is an integral part of India. We do not discuss with Pakistan about Rajasthan Punjab or West Bengal so on and so forth of India, or Punjab Sindh or Baluchistan of Pakistan which are parts of Pakistan; then why should we from our side discuss about Kashmir? What is the rationale behind this wording? Ok the talks are going on, right or wrong good or bad and so on .., why to lime light Hyrriats by ourselves? The so called Kashmiri Hyrriat is basic Indian citizen and he has national obligation to follow the instructions of the government any point of time. If the instructions are wrong to him or them they can challenge in the Indian court of law as any other citizen of India is given the right. If we do not want them to attend the reception given by Pakistan High commissioner, they would have been forbidden to attend in the normal course of law without making any announcement as publicly as done by our Foreign minister.  Why we have to bring Simla agreement for our Indian citizens from not attending as it does not allow any  third party?  Even on the agenda of the meeting it would have been left to the two heads of the meeting to agree upon or disagree which they would have done across the table; and the outcome would have come after cordially attending the meeting. Here the pre meeting situation would have been handled with high maturity which lacked from both ends.
