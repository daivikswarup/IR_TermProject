Headline::::Not Everyone in Bihar Cheats



DateTime::::2015-04-08T19:47:00+05:30



Mathematician Anand Kumar is the founder of Super 30 in Patna, which, every year, coaches 30 students from poor families for one of the most competitive tests in the world - the entrance exam for the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT).
	The recent photographs of cheating in Bihar have given an impression, somewhat unfairly, that everyone in the state resorts to cheating to get through exams. I can give you hundreds of examples where young students struggled through hardships and a severely lacking  infrastructure in schools and colleges, and yet made it without any unfair means. Many such students come and get admitted to my coaching institute too, they are the true examples of perseverance and hard work.
	In Bihar, there has been a long-standing tradition that it's just a particular class that wants to study and gives its children the best facilities. The poor have always been neglected. So many private English-medium schools have opened up. Who is going to these schools? Only those who can pay.  
	 
	But those children who go to government schools still find no teachers, find classrooms devoid of the most basic facilities. I think society and the government, both need to find a solution. Every teacher should try and learn more, and also attend the school he or she is assigned to, and actually teach! They may not have ideal working conditions, but they do should do their job, and consider it more important than other normal jobs.
	Students and parents also need to say to themselves - "We will not use unfair means to clear exams. We will try and get the government to address inequalities in education. We will protest peacefully, but we will not cheat." Also, there needs to be a sense of shame that accompanies cheating - and not just when the person gets caught. It should not be considered the done thing - yeh toh har saal hota hai.
	The government should do more than just pay lip service to the state of education. Recruiting teachers and ensuring a decent student-to-teacher ratio is fine, but the quality needs to be shored up too."
	                                                             
	We need to be serious about teacher recruitment. This is the group in whose hands the future of the country rests. I believe teacher salaries should be good. Teachers should be given permanent appointments, and not be hired on contract. These steps will ensure they are attracted to their jobs.
	 
	I also think people already recruited shouldn't be thrown out - this lowers morale, creates a feeling of job insecurity. But one solution could be to impart training to all teachers, and link their subsequent promotions and salary hikes to their performance and how well they have imbibed their training. Then they will have to perform in classes to prove their skills and worth.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Salute to this man. I have been in US for more than 8 years and seen elementary teachings. None of the teacher I met have that commitment and true love for teaching. India is lucky to have brilliant teachers like Anand. He should be given Padmabhushan and all the respect an exceptional person like him deserves. It has been too much focus on actors and sportstar but they just give you entertainment. A honest teacher like Anand give you skills to earn your self respect and godly educational skills to compete in this world. No world cup win or box office collection of 600 crores gives a damn of that.

                            Let me put a reason on backing Anand here. IITs are one of the toughest exams in the world and if this man is motivating/educating poor kids to compete and in fact get the positive results, it's sheer determination almost on same scale or even better, when a player wins a world title for his country fighting all challenges - monetary, infrastructure and politics.

                            yes...it would be unfair to paint everyone with the same brush.....quality of education can be uplifted if educated people are given the responsibilty not only degree holders......

                            Forget Bihar, anyone outside India who saw those pictures will assume all students in India obtain marks like that. Most foreigners dont know anything about Indian states and the status of Bihar etc. They just see this as an example of India's educational system. So I'm afraid this is not just Bihar's problem. Bihar has brought disrepute to the whole nation and to the millions of students who work hard and get their marks through honest efforts.

                            Hopefully Nitish Kumar will not be asking the centre govt. a special package for ensuring free and fair exams.<br/><br/>
I think most of the state have the resources what they lack is political will.

                            Agreed. Nobody should question Anand kumar's credentials. There may be 10 more like him and these are models to emulate. But that shouldnt take away from the fact that there are 90 others who cheat , fake age, indulge in both petty and heinous crimes ,break and bend rules,manipulate the system, promote their own sons, daughters and castemen,treat national resources as their personal fiefdom as happened in the case of the Indian Railways earlier.<br/><br/>
Doesnt It reflect the  rotten moral compass of Bihars's society that entire villages- parents ,relatives, elders gang up and try to beat away policemen who were trying to ensure a fair exam. How does Anand kumar justify that ? <br/><br/>
Their own state and society has been wrecked . Now they migrate enmasse to places like Maharashtra, Gujarat ,Bangalore, Chennai, Kerala, Delhi and try to do the same in these places too.

                            Lot of respect for this great man Anand, have seen many programs on him. in my opinion the point here is, the famous photographs put the Bihar in bad-light, its absolutely right that Not everyone does cheat in Bihar, but there is a public perception on this and pictures like these fuel to that, I think imp point is how to change that image, without denying the reality

                            The media's prime job should be to give a voice to the voiceless and not to make fun of then as you did in your 'shakes-spear' article. This is a redemption article but is in good light.

                            Oh yeah? Well it seems most do. What you should examine is as to why this takes place at all. It seems to be more a law and order issue rather than cheating per se. In a feudal society like Bihar, everyone thinks he has the right to do anything without bothering about consequences. Because they are confident that there will be no consequences. High time that all wrong doing was penalised. Then scenes like this will not be repeated.

                            I agree. Not everyone in Bihar cheats. Yes and No. If it isnt examinations then it has to be with birth certificates...or...anything that has to do with a sense of entitlement to government schemes. One respects hard working and deserving students from all around the country...but I am afraid there are some states in our country where everything is reduced to a farce.Why dont we see this happening in south india for instance? Is it ethics or morality or simply respecting norms or cultural? In UP a previous SP government wanted to pass a legislation making copying during exams legal! Why send kids to school then? Or why hold exams? Let us create the first society on planet earth where illiteracy is celebrated! The problem lying in wait for us in the future is when a few better educated regions of the country will run into ones that aren't. Already parts of the country that are better educated are the ones having better living indices. Tomorrow kids from Bihar will face problems when they seek admission to institutions of higher education in other parts of the country. But...well this is India...so everything goes...!

                            Even permanent teachers, lecturers are not ready to do efforts and teach sincerely. They want private coaching from students. Even if they are paid good by govt.

                            @ chintamani.popatlal.parivar: Well, I would advise you to read "The smartest kids in the world" by Amanda Ripley and you will see where does american kids stand. Do you know what PISA test is ? I am sure you don't other wise would not have made such comments. Go and see where does America stands in Mathematics at elementary and high scho level. 36th rank in the world. What Anand is doing is incomparable. And doesn't matter I am bihari or not. The fact I am raising has nothing to do with any state but to do with an individual determination to do good things in life. Ever read Vivekananda?

                            I agree with the writer. Out of 10000 1 does not cheat in Bihar. Because if even 10% were giving exam farely they would oppose open cheating for the others as no one would want their kins hard work to go in vain. Since no one opposes I decrease the figure to &lt; 0.05% who are fair.

                            Of course not. In fact, when I was growing up, people from Patna and all of Bihar were considered sophisticated. Education levels were high. Little wonder that most of the PSU staff in those were from Bihar. Besides, cheats exist everywhere. From Bengal to Gujarat, Kashmir to Tamil Nadu. THis picture could have been from anywher. This one happens to be from Patna. BTW, I am not a Bihari.

                            Its unfair to paint everyone by same brush. Bihar is also the land which produced talented best-selling author like SATYAPAL CHANDRA who is true example of preservence, modesty and handwork. In fact he is a true icon.

                            it should be noted that the author here does not teach the students in super30. He merely gets the best students in Bihar (from less privileged backgrounds) through a talent exam.<br/><br/>
What is less known is that he crams and teaches a couple of thousand students for IIT JEE and charges them money as well.

                            @ Manpreet Singh Sangha: I would say, We will waste our energy talking about any nonsense we see. Rather , let's give credit to those who deserves. It should result in a fission like reaction where hopefully kids in Bihar emulates what's worth in life. Media need to play a dominant role and project only what's good in Bihar. Ignore all non sense. People will forget corrupt politicians in next 10 years but will remember good people only like Anand. Media has to play a dominant role.

                            @Ajit : I agree with you brother. But  Anand  is doing best to his capabilities. He is not a politician but he is giving greatest power in the hands of the kids who if there genes are honest, should repay back to Bihar.<br/><br/>
The issues you have listed are very valid but unfortunately the root cause for the issues originate in the schools and at home only. I have often heard that most of the graduates from Bihar want to go in Civil Services and being powerful is their only aim. I am sure it is coming from the fact what they have seen in society in Bihar. But now the youth also want to go to technology and management. May be power is not that much enticing under corrupt politicians any more. Anand is leading them to IITs. Change will come, my brother. It will come.

                            Great and inspirational stuff being done by Anand. Cheating ofcourse is a big, separate issue- in Bihar and equally (if not more) in some of the other largest states in the North and West India. The photo that was being circulated across serve social media platforms does give the shock value and needs to be condemned. But at the same time, all of us (including the government) have to do our own bit in removing this.
