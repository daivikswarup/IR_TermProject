Headline::::Beware the Cult, Arvind Kejriwal



DateTime::::2015-03-03T03:16:00+05:30



(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer. She is working on a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi which will be published later this year.)
	A well-meaning psephologist once told me that he found an uncanny resemblance between Narendra Modi and Arvind Kejriwal. Both would lead their respective parties to victory, both great orators and both autocratic with zero tolerance to dissenting voices and ideas. Both also have equally unyielding second-in-commands and confidantes.
	 
	A week before the Delhi elections and in many other editorials in the last three years, I have consistently maintained that Kejriwal, despite being a mass leader who had his pulse on the ground, a man whose party named and shamed various business houses, risked being a cult, endangering the prospects of the Aam Aadmi Party.
	 
	It was Kejriwal's arrogance which led to the AAP's defeat in the Lok Sabha elections last year and later his humility which allowed the party to rout both the BJP and the Congress in Delhi. And the reason it managed this thunderous victory was the belief of the people of Delhi that the AAP was not a party that was remote-controlled by the High Command and that differentiated it from the other two parties.
	 
	When Sanjay Singh, member of the AAP political affairs committee tweeted this morning, "The people who want to remove Arvind Kejriwal from the National Convenor's, do they know what the worker is feeling?"  was a sense of deja vu.
	 
	The tweet was clearly aimed at two leaders who were seen as the ideological backbone of the party, which has in recent times enjoyed the support of left leaning students and academics alike - Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav. Bhushan, whose views on Kashmir and plebiscite were rejected by the AAP last year - had confided in friends a few months ago, his decision to quit the party right after the Delhi  elections. His father Shanti Bhushan, an ex law minister, endorsed the candidacy of Kiran Bedi as presumptive Delhi chief minister by AAP, a move which was seen as belittling Kejriwals image in his party.
	But Prashant Bhushan, who had shot off a letter to AAP with a set of what he called 'concrete steps' to be the party with a difference, rubbishes the claim. In a conversation with me this morning, Prashant laughed off allegations that suggested that his rebellion was a calculated move with the backing of finance Minister Arun Jaitley. It must be noted that Prashant Bhushan has been in the news also for the mail leaks from Essar which establishes a corporate- journalist- politics nexus and named Nitin Gadkari as one of the beneficiaries.
	 
	 Sources in the Aam Aadmi Party who refused to come on record, alleged that Prashant's public interest litigation in the Essar leaks smacked of connivance with Jaitley to help further his ambition in the BJP.  Gadkari's less than cordial relations with Jaitley is no news and the fact that Prashant's PIL also names a journalist who is associated with the AAP, as a beneficiary of Essar largesse is being seen with suspicion.
	 
	On his part , Bhushan dismisses these allegations as the imagination of a fertile mind "My joining the BJP or aligning with Jaitley is next to impossible. What I sought from the AAP is what I wrote in the letter, a clean model of governance that the masses voted us for."
	 
	Another leader in the eye of the storm is psephologist Yogendra Yadav who co-authored the charter of demands for AAP with Prashant Bhushan and is now the target of AAP ire. AAP wants the two leaders out for their dissenting views on various subjects.
	 
	The note authored by the two asks for: the setting up of an internal ethics committee, a probe into cheques of over 50 lacs received in the form of donations by the party, allowing state units of AAP to work on strategy rather than have Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and the rest make decisions for them, record minutes of national executive meetings and the PAC and make it public to the aam aadmi.
	 
	What has been seen as the last straw in the deepening rift between Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan and the others is an unofficial executive meeting that took place a day after the national executive of the party met on February 26.
	 
	On February 26, Kejriwal had offered to resign as national convenor, which was then rejected. It was followed by a decision which according to those close to Bhushan was taken by the coterie that surrounds Kejriwal, allowing the latter to reconstitute the PAC, paving the way for the exit of Yadav and Bhushan from political decision-making processes.
	As a left leaning intellectual close to Prashant added, "Isn't this the cult culture we as a party stood vehemently against? If the likes of Sisodia and Sanjay Singh like to reap political benefits by lending a cult image to Arvind Kejriwal and make it an autocratic party which suffocates dissenting voices and opinions, then this must be the beginning of the decline of the AAP and everything that it stood for."
	 
	While the success story of AAP might continue unabated with both the Left and Congress in an abysmal disarray in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal needs to shed the autocratic image that he has refused to detach himself from.
	His party enjoys the reputation of a socialist image whose beauty lies in the pluralism of views and ideas, not just of its leaders but also of the aam aadmi. If Arvind wants the AAP to be a party with a difference, he needs to apply the same logic of propriety that he expects from other political parties and alleged crony capitalists. Let Arvind Kejriwal not be the prototype of the political leader George Bernard Shaw described as, "he knows nothing; and he thinks he knows everything. That points clearly to a political career."Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            If Kejriwal does not get rid of his ahankaar soon he will betray the whole nation and especially Delhiites by destroying himself and his AAP in no time.Expelling The two seniors is like cutting the branch on which he stands. While Modi failed to demolish AAP Kejriwal will succeed.

                            By lending your two cents on AAP as you are the stooge of BJP and now comprehend this...We look at Arvind Kejriwal as the head of central leadership and not as a cult figure like MODI is as you are familiar with his working style. How can you tell the difference Arvind on one hand does protest for a cause for greater good of the people and Modi does protest to get what he wants in the end. (Narmada dam- submerging hundred of villages without providing proper livelihood and relocation for the effected lot)<br/>
Yes, Leadership demands discipline and patience to go national and these are the very qualities Yadav and Bhusan were lacking thus getting sacked. It is good for AAP to have natural progression and leave power hungry &amp; stale leadership behind and thrive on new blood coming into the party as it expands. This churning is good for the AAP party.

                            I expected, AK, as a true leader, to have come out publicly clarifying his position on the issue. It is not about two or three individual, but about the faith of the people about AAP. Unless the faith of public is not proven by conduct, AAP will surely fade into history in no time. Silence of AK is only helping one to believe that reports are 100% true. People making AK larger than life image does irreparable damage to his political career. I sincerely hope AK will not fall into the trap of "chamchas" who surely do so

                            Rana Ayyub your analogy and argument is absolutely wrong and misleading. I also thought Kejriwal is being more powerful and respect (still) Yadav the most. Still, both are assets of the party, but Bhushan's political acumen is questionable. We cannot shy away the fact that Kejriwal is the glue which brought and kept different viewpoints in the party. No wonder AAP members are rallying behind him, and earning name of being Kejriwal devotees! I find this absolute nonsense. Kejriwal is  hard working, and lives on ground rather than wondering in dreamworld like Bhushans  and Yadav! How can you call him undemocratic just because he did not listen to Bhushans (some would say politically disastrous) ideas of expansion in states? Who is using arm twisting tactics and being undemocratic? My respect for Yadav fell because he shirked responsibility of loss in national election which was his idea forced on Kejriwal! After the loss or whenever any accusations come against AAP, Kejriwal takes all the beating, and Yadav and Bhushans remain medias good boys. Secondly when AVAM accused AAP, Yadav said 'he was away for campaign at that time when the funds came'! It was shocking because he was in charge of scrutiny of funds, why did not he do his job properly? I can understand a great number of media intellectuals want AAP to weaken so that their favourite congress party can revive, but so long pragmatic people are in AAP it won't be possible. I would expect AAP to remain united, and depend of voting for any idea before acceptance.

                            You disappoint me by making irresponsible, simplified statements and calling them facts (why AAP lost Lokh Sabha, and why they won Delhi). It is your concocted assumption and you build an entire article around it, damming the guy. At least give the guy a year or two before you stand to pass judgement. You come through as the person with an agenda not others.

                            What is YY's contribution to the party's win in Delhi? AAP became a force in Delhi because of Delhi dialogues and the grass root work at the booth level by thousands of people (maybe, including YY). What YY did in LS elections (so called party building exercise) wasn't helpful for the party. Results itself proves it (don't forget he himself was 4th in Gurgaon). Therefore, national ambitions will be achieved when the Delhi model will be replicated and it's not dependent on YY.<br/><br/>
If AK fits in the category of being cult. YY fits too. At least, AK's cult won us Delhi election.

                            AAP lost the occasion where they would have come out winner but they lost and acted like any other party. Their action is not justified as instead of facing the valid concerns they found the easy act to suppress the issues. Not good for AAP. I think AAP should act maturely.

                            i Most honestly believe that Shanti Bhushan is doing something with Jaitley because in a meeting organized by jaitley to Galvanize support for NJC , Shanti Bhushan was there and i can read between lines.<br/><br/>
But Kejriwal should show that he is democrat and not an autocrat like Ms Shazia potrayed him as. He should not only keep Prashant and Yogendra in panel but also should order a ethical committe and should reasign as national convener of AAP.<br/>
 This wil establish AAP firmly as aa party with difference.

                            Prashant Bushans role became suspect when his father said Kiran Bedi is a better CM. I think both father and son are leaning towards the BJP. As to Yogendra Yadav isnt it better that he sticks to academics and psephology both of which he is good at.  Power mongering does not suit him. As to Prashant Bushan the earlier he is kicked out of the party better...

                            Kejriwal should take a leaf out of Nehru's book and make a character analysis of himself. It might be very helpful to him, his party and the nation. (Some may be aware that Jawaharlal Nehru wrote an article on his own flaws such as a dictatorial tendency!)

I guess kursi mein favicol hai. Now I know why Anna stayed away from AK.<br/><br/>
Sad day.  Delhites were fooled to get a different party.<br/><br/>
At this rate he will be down from 67 to 3 in five.  Giving subsidized electricity was done by mayawati and mulayam.  Keep in mind Delhi is not UP.  Or maybe it is.<br/><br/>

                            How quick we are to judge AAP. Like they are supposed to be this group of Perfect Godlike Super Humans. How dare they behave like normal humans? Whatever happened to their so-called idealism? How dare they display human traits of jealousy, connivance, manipulative machinations, power hungriness that are the 'normal' traits of the rest of humankind?<br/><br/>
Any group of people, no matter how well intentioned, will always be like any other group of people: with its share of dissenters, perhaps even outright negative persons also. What matters is what the majority of people in this are group like. Are their stated intentions and ideals to be trusted? Or was it all just a sham?<br/><br/>
To know this our questions need to be a bit different.<br/><br/>
Are they likely to come through on their promises? Will they be able to provide quality education through the setting up of 500 new govt schools? Will they improve the quality of govt healthcare? Will they be able to address the sanitation needs of sixty lakh people who do not have basic facilities?<br/><br/>
Will they?<br/><br/>
These are the questions I will keep my focus on. My faith in AAP is based on the belief that they will come through. In my heart I have no doubt of this.

                            AAP's huge success in Delhi was because it got middle classes also on board and bluntly rejected support by Shahi Imam. They should not become yet another socialist, populist and secular party. Rather they should be a pragmatic party which learns along the way without taking too many extreme positions. The country has seen through populist parties that engage in vote bank politics that wake up just before election.

                            How can a cult be built around such a feeble character?  His credentials should have given the game away.  Previously he fled the scene in 49 days.  Now he wants 10 days off to recuperate! If he cannot even control his cough and blood-sugar levels, he cannot possibly control the capital city of India!  A cult revolves around a strong personality, not a feeble weakling given to making accusations and then running away from taking any sort of action.  A character who surrounds himself with the likes of Somnath Bharti, Sanjay Singh and Manish Sisodia may become a 'cult figure' within that narrow circle of shady characters.  The rest of us will always regards him as a joke figure!

                            how could u say..it was arvind decision to go for loksabha election. Rather as per news he was against it and this was backed by Yogendra yadav ji.<br/><br/>
I respect arvind,yogendra and prashant and party need them.<br/><br/>
But as an outsider, one difference which i observe is: Yogendra yadav still want to go nation wide and arvind want to concentrate on delhi. Once delhi model successfull, then expansion would not take much time.
