Headline::::Kejriwal's Willingness to Say 'Sorry' Has Paid Off



DateTime::::2015-02-08T17:16:00+05:30




                                
	(Siddharth Varadarajan is a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Public Affairs and Critical Theory, Shiv Nadar University)
	Before Arvind Kejriwal breaks out the aam aadmi's equivalent of champagne, he would do well to remember how the exit polls of December 2013 got the Delhi result horribly wrong the last time the city voted for its Assembly.
	 
	Apart from Chanakya, who gave the Aam Aadmi Party 31 seats, virtually every other exit poll projected the AAP finishing in single digits as a poor third, well behind the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress. So today, if the story the exit polls are telling is of an AAP victory or even landslide, the party's supporters would be well advised to wait for the first actual trends and results on February 10th.
	 
	Regardless of the final election result, however, three conclusions are inescapable.
	 
	First, the BJP messed up its strategy badly and ended up fighting with its back to the wall despite the advantages that Narendra Modi's popularity as a national leader and the size of its election fund provided it. The source of most of its funding remains unknown but that's a point for another discussion. The fact is that the BJP unnecessarily delayed the Delhi election, mysteriously purged the one candidate, Dr Harsh Vardhan, who would have given the party a boost, parachuted in the controversial Kiran Bedi over the heads of its local leadership and wasted the 'Modi card' by using it in such a negative way. An AAP leader described the BJP's overall strategy as "snatching defeat from the jaws of victory." If the party still manages to win, it will be because voters decided to play safe and choose a party that is also in power at the Centre so as to ensure a smoother financial ride for the national capital.
	 
	Second, the AAP, which was being written off after its failure to win a single Lok Sabha seat from its Delhi stronghold has managed to bring itself back into the centre of the political game. Kejriwal diluted the 'bhagoda' charge by taking it on the chin and apologizing for his blunder, but he also used that mistake to leverage the unique appeal of AAP: "We had consulted you, the people of Delhi, on every decision we had taken till then. Our mistake was in not going back to you before resigning." Even if the party effort falls short of the 'paanch saal' Kejriwal sought from the city's electorate, this is no mean accomplishment. The AAP leader has succeeded in putting the taint of abandoning his position as Chief Minister after 49 days in power behind him now.
	 
	Third, the Congress ran a desultory campaign in which the last minute appearance of its vice-president, Rahul Gandhi, failed to convince voters that the party had any reasonable prospects. The final outcome, of course, will depend on the extent to which the Congress vote collapsed. All exit poll results bar one indicate a calamitous decline in its vote share as erstwhile Congress supporters chose AAP instead. But if the decline is not that steep, the BJP will end up benefiting. Indeed, the political grapevine was abuzz the past few days with the rumour that BJP president Amit Shah had mobilized his supporters to throng Rahul Gandhi's road show in an attempt to convince Congress voters not to give up hope!
	 
	But more than the Congress decline and the apparent plateauing of the 'Modi wave', Delhi 2015 has been marked by the revival of the AAP. How did the party manage this despite its meagre resources, internal divisions and the hostility of a large section of the media?
	 
	The AAP cause was helped by the essential strength and appeal of its core idea - the need for a party of ordinary folks - and by fact that it started campaigning well before the assembly elections were called.
	 
	Even as the BJP wasted precious time trying to see if it could form the government by luring dissidents from the AAP, party volunteers were busy mobilizing support amongst the poorest residents of Delhi. Though the media - and the city's middle class and elite - had mixed-to-hostile feelings about the somewhat chaotic, seat-of-the-pants administration Kejriwal ran, the poor remembered his 49 days for the delivery of free water, lower electricity bills and an end to the petty corruption of government officials.  To this, the party grafted new promises on housing, education and even jobs. By the time the elections were called, AAP hit the ground running, this time with Delhi's working masses squarely on its side. Innovative proposals like a city-wide WiFi service were attractive to the 'aspirational' lower middle class that had thronged to the BJP last year.
	 
	If the poor had earlier been the 'natural' constituency of the Congress, AAP also managed to make inroads in other vital sections of that constituency: the minorities and the Dalits.
	 
	Exit polls suggest that an overwhelming majority of Muslim voters backed the AAP this time, just as they had in the 2014 general elections. Christians are more geographically dispersed but are also likely to thrown their weight behind AAP. The preferences of these two communities are clearly driven by their lack of faith in the BJP's promise of 'sab ke saath'. The strident communal rhetoric of the sangh parivar's various outfits in the past eight months has chipped away at any goodwill Modi might have generated by his talk of "development".
	 
	The fact that minority votes came to the AAP without the latter resorting to the "vote bank", tokenistic policies of the Congress is a good sign for Indian politics. Like Modi did last year, Kejriwal promised development for all. It's just that Muslims and Christians seem more willing to believe the AAP on this than they are the BJP. The AAP also showed great wisdom in recognising the Shahi Imam's support for the poisoned chalice it was and rejecting it out of hand.
	 
	Kejriwal's message, of course, was not just development but development with equity, something the AAP was able to reinforce through hundreds of mohalla meetings where its campaigners drew attention to the manner in which the Modi sarkari has been changing environmental and land use laws to favour big companies. If the exit polls are right and the AAP wins, it would be worth analyzing whether the party took away just the new voters Modi had mobilized for the BJP in 2014 or also managed to bring over to its side a section of Delhi's 'traditional' BJP voters. It's over to the 10th now.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            The problem with BJP is that there is only one true leader. The other simply make noise. Also, Modi made so many promises during elections but not one was fulfilled.<br/><br/>
I was shocked when Modi spoke about reduction in petrol prices as one of the govt's achievements. The last time he came he promised to bring black money back despite UPA govt. saying it was impossible with a lot of foreign loopholes. Now NDA is singing the same tune. <br/><br/>
The less said about RSS, VHP and Hindu Mahasabha, the better. They have to be kept under control, otherwise we will go nowhere.

Just gut feel, came across as a good guy. BJP Delhi corruption too tall an obstacle for modi or shah or bedi. Nothing wrong with strategy.

                            Its important AAP wins bcoz the poll model to win which BJP follows (break othr party candidates + smear campaigns + just propaganda about development without any ) is very dangerous for India. All political parties must understand that they are there for the people and not for their party once in power. Just a TV image will not be used to fool people. It works only when ur opponents are also corrupt and inefficient administrators

                            THERE IS A SAYING THAT WISE MEN LEARNS THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS AND FOOLS BY THEIR OWN. WHAT TO CALL THE DELHI ITES IF AAP WINS- INSPITE OF ONE TORRID EXPERIENCE. FREE WATER OF 21000 LITRES FOR EVERY FAMILY IN DELHI?. EVEN IF YOU PAY YOU CANT GET HALF OF THAT IN DELHI NOW. AND SUBSIDIZED ELECTRICITY? HAS AAP CHECKED THE COST OF ELECTRICITY IN OTHER STATES? WHO WILL PRODUCE THE ELECTRICITY?. HAS AAP ANY IDEA OF THE AMOUNT REQUIRED FOR THESE FREEBIES? WHERE IS THE BUDGET FOR ALL THESE?. AGAIN KEJRIWAL WILL START BLAMING MODIJI AND ULTIMATELY RUN AWAY SO THAT HE CAN AGAIN FOOL THE PUBLIC. IF HE STAYS IN POWER FOR FIVE YEARS, IF AT ALL THIS PARTY WINS, THOSE WHO HAVE VOTED FOR HIM THEMSELVES WILL THROW HIM OUT FOR HAVING FOOLED THEM MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE HAD DONE SO FAR. WHEN WILL OUR COUNTRYMEN LEARN. EVERY BODY SYMPATHIZES WITH THE POOR. BUT THE SOLUTION IS NOT IN GIVING FREEBIES BUT RATHER EMPOWER THEM BY GIVING THEM JOBS TO AFFORD THESE COSTS SO THAT THEY ALSO HAVE A SENSE OF PRIDE OF HAVING EARNED IT THEMSELVES --AND THEY NO LONGER REMAIN POOR. DELHI HAD A GOLDEN CHANCE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF MODIJI AND KIRAN BEDIJI FOR ROOTING OUT CORRUPTION WHICH IS THE SOLE BANE OF DELHI. LET US PRAY AND KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED FOR BJP TO WIN DELHI ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS.

                            Who ever wins, India needs clean politics as people will not be fooled by empty sloganeering.One thing that caught my attention  during the din of the election was; at every possible opportunity and interview Kiran Bedi was accusing and name calling Kejriwal but he always said she is good Woman and person of integrity but in a wrong party. In public spaces which ever party or situation one may find one needs to respect each other. I am an admirer of Ms.Kiran Bedi's credentials but her arrogance in the interviews put me off. In public life one needs to be gracious in conduct.

                            If AAP wins it is not just AK willingness to apologies but also substantially BJP's arrogance and high and mighty attitude. An average Indian wants peaceful coexistence. BJP excess baggage of the Right wing negative outfits who believe I do not know whether to call them Hindu because Hindu is teaches you only love and peace. I think it is time the Prime Minister send a strong message to these Extreme right wing negative thugs their behaviour and agenda is not acceptable to the wast majority. I liked the PM slogan Progress for all for this we need work together; there is no space for any form of fundamentalism or attacks on any community. Progress can happen only in an atmosphere peace and love and not in an atmosphere of hate and violence. If AAP wins it a strong signal message to BJP on communal harmony for progress.

                            Certain conclusions drawn here are similar to the ones echoed in all TV talk shows, to which I disagree. I have some points to make: <br/>
1. With or without Bedi, the result for BJP would have been the same. Let us not forget that there is lot of infighting in Delhi BJP, lot of ego clashes among its top leaders. It was to tame this clash that the BJP brought in Bedi an outsider. I am sure without Bedi, BJP would have got even lesser seats. Let us also not forget the charges against Upadhyaya leveled by Kejriwal were given to him by a BJP leader, because at that time Upadhyaya was the front runner. In place of Upadhyay had been Harshwardhan or anybody else, same would have happened against him. <br/>
2. The biggest blunder by BJP had been to delay the elections. After the emphatic win in Loksabha and winning all seven seats in Delhi. BJP should have declared elections in Delhi, this would have given less time to battered AAP after the lok sabha elections and BJP would have got the lok sabha wave benefit. <br/><br/>
Nevertheless, it is now AAP and all the best to Kejriwal, probably errors of omission and commission of one opponent make your strength. Kejriwal deserved this win and he is now awarded with it.

                            Socialism has failed everywhere. Look at the Soviet Union. Nothing is free. Money doesnt grow on trees. Kejriwal &amp; AAP are the epitome of Communism &amp; Socialism. Take from person A &amp; give it to person B. If AAP wins, Delhi has missed a great opportunity for Narendra Modi to make it a great National Capital. Look at West Bengal under communism. West Bengal was in shambles under Jyoti Basu's party. <br/>
AAP = Communism. India had a great chance under Modi. It will be sad if AAP wins.

                            Its that time of the post election scene when everybody who fancies his agenda getting ahead starts pontificating on the outcome. its apparent that the lethargy of the national parties led to a makeshift unit getting the support of uber cool young for whom this is also an evening out replete with sensation worth lasting for an evening. Congress has apparently shot itself in the foot when they are the party which should have revived by this election. BJP fought this election too on Anti Congress plank resulting in a disconnect. AAP a propagandist outfit just benefitted from the fact they had nothing to lose. That just does not translate into gains for the young whose "evening" may just come to an end by the time the results are out.

And, are you afraid of campaigning against the industrialists and thoughtless government policies in this regard ? Why doesn't anyone look at the root cause ?

                            A real analysis which grossly reflects the basic motives supplementing the article.On the other hand we can grossly affirm that we Indians are open to accepting and forgiving mistakes. The actual results of this 'apology' will have to be reflected by actions if Mr. Kejriwal is sworn, as the exit polls indicate.

                            Kejriwal  never stick to only job, you see in wikipedia as he changes often his job and also his words to suit his advantage. Hence i doubt about his intention to serve the society. if he finds it is not possible to fulfill his promises to people, he would blame central government BJP and modi and shift the blame on them and do dharnas. He is a born anarchist. i regret for delhi people poor judgement on this person.

                            What BJP or Congress does in parliament is discussion but the same thing done by AAP is called as Dharna or Anarchy. BJP had formed state government in Karnataka and Karnataka became the most corrupt state in India. All the scams happened either during Congress or BJP rule. Doesn't all the auto unions, transport union, doctor's union, laywer's union do dharna to get their terms agreed upon by the govt..so what's wrong when a common man does the same. people are asking about the paltry sum of 2cr which AK collected for party funds. Oh so congress and BJP gets their funds from all the clean ways. yes, AK stepped out from his CM position but at least he kept his words. Did your Namo kept his words by getting all the black money back to India - NO 'because he is one of the culprits in that list'. How many promises did BJP sarkar have kept till date from the day of formation of govt in centre. Everyday, you can hear multiple cases of rapes been reported. What has changed?

                            This is a strong message for the rogue elements in the BJP to comply to their mandate of development and for Modi to get on to work than launching campaigns unlike in Gujarat which was fed with buffalo milk……. All the time

                            Sorry for what? For using an independent thinking? Sorry to whom? To the guys who themselves have only done one thing for the state "caste a vote" and think that they deserve an apology from a team that has risen to help them. Sorry, why? Are we doing AAP or AK a favour or is he doing us a favour? Is he serving us or we are serving him? He is doing us a favour, people. Get it straight and let him do his job his way. Or quit your regular job and participate in elections. For a moment if i do assume he had to say sorry and then let's assume he did not say sorry, then what? What are your options? Just because he said sorry we are electing him back, that means he is a terribly much better option. Which in a way says he is the only option we have vis-a-vis electing goondas. Given that situation, if he would not apologize, would you then give your vote and mark of approval to a goonda? How stupd and egotistic that would be? Think. Anyways, AK and team knows what we masses are "stupid", so he realized "let's apologize even though it is contrary to logic; because with stupid audience you have to do stupid things". Ha. Thank god he is a rational person.

                            It is not AAP win but mistakes of BJP <br/>
1. They should have retain this fight between AK and Modi <br/>
2. They should have clearly have discussed cons of AAP agenda <br/>
3. KB being a good person and good manager doesnt appeal to public as such <br/>
4. Amit shah and Modi was behaiving like high command <br/>
5. They should have restricted themself with development agenda <br/>
6. They could have claimed that with growth , each person will have so much increase in their earnings which will make current bill affordable to them <br/>
Even if Kejriwal fail to deliver his promises , he can always blame others saying all this discom got protection from center , thats why they are not reducing rates . For free water they can always blame haryana and BJP government over there

                            Not anything paid off to Mr. Kejriwall, much less his "Sorry". Its PURE  "ego &amp; whims" of jurnos, TV channels and of course Muslims and Christians voting en-mass to AAP.
