                                Why does the BJP think it is necessary to lecture its critics about India being "a tolerant nation?" Is it because they don't get what's being said, or is it because in their arrogance, they equate criticism of the Hindutva brigade as criticism of India, and thus any concern about the growing intolerance in India becomes an accusation of being anti-national.
When citizens express concerns about the environment of growing intolerance, it is not to criticize India, but to protect India from the forces who are straining every nerve to transform India into an intolerant authoritarian theocratic State.
 
There is a wide chasm between what the idea of India is and what some people want India to be. The idea of India is a tolerant nation with pluralist cultures, shared histories, diverse languages, ways of life, multiple cuisines, ways of dress, customs. These are objective realities which provide the material basis for a robust, secular and equality-based polity. Whether that idea will ever get translated in its totality is yet to be seen, but it was this idea that the Prime Minister laid claim to when he addressed the British Parliament and earlier the British press. India is tolerant, he said. Yes, Mr. Prime Minister, India is tolerant but not the brigades who act in the name of Hindutva who enjoy political patronage and who have the license to purvey hate day after day ever since your government assumed power.
 
Aamir Khan is the most recent target of the Hindutva brigade. He spoke his heart out and that of his equally talented partner Kiran Rao. Whether they are practicing believers or not is their personal matter, what is in the public domain is that belonging to different religions did not prevent them from loving each other and getting married. They have a child. When a person at Aamir Khan's level of success can express feelings of concern, of apprehension, of fear for the future of his child, instead of taking it seriously, the government spokesmen call it "alarmist" and "ingratitude to fans".
 
It is this dismissive arrogance of the government and ruling party spokesmen which then get backed by the vicious trolls on social media, which has been the hallmark ever since eminent citizens of India have started warning about the growing intolerant trends.
When Nayantara Sehgal protested, she was brushed aside as a member of "the dynasty"; when some of the most respected writers returned their awards, they were branded as being "selective", when 107 of the most brilliant scientists addressed an open letter to the government they too were damned, when historians raised their voices they were called "communists"; in other words, the government and the ruling party, while railing against these intellectuals, have refused to address the real issues.
It is a real issue today that a young couple in love with each other, one a Hindu the other a Muslim, are fearful of being lynched by those who spread hate in the name of love jihad. Anupam Kher and other supporters of the government have called such elements "fringe" elements. Members of the Cabinet, Members of Parliament who make the most provocative statements inciting violence against such relationships are not the fringe; they are the core, in important positions in the ruling party and government.
 
It is a real issue that a Muslim was lynched and beaten to death on the manufactured rumour that he had slaughtered a cow and stored beef in his home. It is said this was an aberration. But then what was the message sought to be conveyed by the official BJP advertisement splashed in all the newspapers on the eve of the Bihar elections with the cow as the symbol of Hindu Pride being "insulted''? It was no aberration, but a deliberate plan to rouse religious sentiments as a vote guarantee. The anti-cow slaughter campaign continues to target Muslims in vile ways.
 
It is a real issue when intellectuals, rationalists who write against the unscientific superstitions spread by the Hindutva brigade are targeted. When Comrade Pansare was brutally killed, when Kalburgi was savagely murdered, when Perumal Murugan is targeted, when Girish Karnad is threatened because he expressed a different view on the history of Tipu Sultan... these are issues.
 
What is required is for the Prime Minister to use his authority in the government and the party to take action from the top, to stop the threats, the abuse, the bullying, the violence by those who owe allegiance to the Sangh Parivar.
 
In the meanwhile, salute to Aamir Khan and before him, Shah Rukh Khan, for speaking the truth regardless of the personal cost.(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Madam Aamir and  SRK weren't targeted by the Hindutva brigade, they were targeted for being hypocritical by people beyond Hindutva and BJP. And communists have no moral standing to talk about this considering your lawlessness in WB, Kerala and now recent Kiss of love. Please do not preach about tolerance when you guys wanted China to win the 1965 war

                            Janab Aamir Khan,<br/><br/>
I am an ordinary Indian citizen and an avid movie-goer. You are a superstar in a country where the majority of movie-goers are Hindu. For years, we have spent our money to buy tickets for your movies. It is our money that has made you what you are today.<br/><br/>
We clapped when as ACP Ajay Rathore, you destroyed a sweet-talking Gulfam Khan in Sarfarosh. We cheered when as Bhuvan, you played the winning shot in Lagaan. We cried when as a sensitive art teacher, you made us root for Ishaan Awasthi in Taarey Zamin Par. <br/><br/>
A couple of generations before you, an Yusouf Khan had to become a Dilip Kumar to be accepted and a Mahajabeen Bano had to reinvent herself as Meena Kumari. Not you though. Neither you, nor your contemporaries had to hide your identity to be successful. <br/><br/>
You became a star in a new India. An India, where only your first name mattered. We loved you because you were Aamir, a brilliant actor. Neither your last name mattered to us, nor your faith. <br/><br/>
But yesterday, you proved to us that for you and your wife at least , it is your last name that matters more than anything else. <br/><br/>
Your name is Khan and you Sir, are a hypocrite.<br/><br/>
You did not scream intolerance when your city burned at the hands of some of your co-religionists. Your wife did not feel insecure when a mammoth crowd of some of your co-religionists attended the funeral of a hanged terrorist. You were silent even when a mob from Reza Academy kicked and destroyed a national memorial and manhandled female cops. <br/><br/>
But now, suddenly, your wife feels insecure in India and wants you to move out. <br/><br/>
If I WERE indeed intolerant, I would suggest you move to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the safest place on earth, where Begum Kiran Rao can feel absolutely secure inside her abaya and your little son can grow up watching public executions in a Riyadh square. <br/><br/>
But I am not going to do that. As a tolerant Indian, the only thing I can and WILL do is to make sure that not even one rupee of my hard-earned money goes towards buying tickets for your movies. <br/><br/>
Thanks for the disappointments.
                         </div>

                            Nobody is questioning Aamir's right to express his views. What majority of people in the Country are wondering is how come nobody felt " unsafe and intolerant" when Sikhs were murdered in 1984; Mumbai bomb blasts happened; after 26/11; 3 million Pundits were massacred. The list can go on - the reality is that all the so-called major incidents that has occurred in last 12 months have happened in non-BJP states. You say law&amp; order is a state subject but blame centre for it. I personally feel that the so-called 'liberals and seculars' are more responsible for dividing this country than BJP or any others. Your respect for democracy is clear - you can't tolerate people's mandate if it is given to BJP in general and Modi in particular.

                            What intolerance is Aamir talking about? It's shameful to hear a few Muslims crybabies talk about intolerance due to political interests. No other country in the world will have a pampered minority community as much as Muslims in India. Free Haj Trips-? Separate law board? Bollywood? Ungrateful people. To become a truly secular state, India should have same uniform law for all communities. There is no country in the world with so much freedom and benefits for Muslims. Not even US and UK.<br/><br/>
By numbers, communal incidents have not increased compared to last year. What intolerance is he talking about? Murders of rationalists happened in Congress ruled states. Why did he not speak about intolerance when Dabholkar was killed in Pune. Congress was ruling at the time. So, there's intolerance only when BJP is in power? Aamir should stop shedding crocodile tears.

                            Your article become communal itself as soon as you used "Aamir Khan is the most recent target of the Hindutva brigade". People do not have objection when Aamir said intolerance increase. The main objection is when he said "My wife said should be leave India", that main point of objection (at least for me).<br/>
Anyways , what is your opinion congress party people asking pakistan's help remove Modi govt??

                            I can see India is too tolerant about everything... Everyone who thinks india has gone intolerant should go live first in countries like Syria, Pakistan, Nigeria, etc. just for few months and come back and share their experience. Have you watch what salman kurshid and other congress leaders said on Pakistan t.v. Inspite of that they are still not jailed or beheaded ... I think India is too tolerant and big for you to understand.

                            The VHP or Hindu Mahasabha are saying exactly what they have been saying all along. What does it have to do with the Government or BJP? Are you expecting them to change just because BJP is in power?  Taslima cannot visit the West Bengal she loves, because of hate. How much are the communists fighting for her rights?  When your heart bleeds for Kalburgi but not for Taslima, there is an inherent bias. Every sane person would be against Kalburgi killing and it happened in Karnataka(congress ruled), let the state Government take appropriate action and bring the killers to Justice. Is anybody stopping that? When Ghulam Ali concert was threatened, the BJP run state government promised full protection. You know Shiv Sena was playing politics just to embarrass the BJP. No different from the Communists playing politics during UPA I and embarrass Congress at every opportunity even though you were in alliance. Finally on people like Yogi Adityanath, he has been elected to Lok Sabha many times in the past. His views are the same with or without BJP in power. Media is highlighting his decibels lot more because BJP is in power. Media highlights left wing extremism when Congress is in power and Rightwing extremism when BJP in power.  Aamir and Shah Rukh should tolerate how politics plays out in a huge/complex democracy like us. Hopefully both Shah Rukh and Aamir will be the first one to acknowledge in India we do not tolerate Shah Rukh and Aamir,  we instead CELEBRATE  them.

                            The BJP seems to have sounded the poll bugle judging by the needless reaction to one sentence taken out of context of the whole interview of Amir Khan during which he criticised riots that had taken place under other party regimes. In the UP , as things stand today, the BJP has next to no chance of winning. Because of the size of the UP assembly , the drubbing will be bigger than Bihar drubbing. Hence every word spoken by the members of the opposition, people imagined to be in opposition and statements from minorities will be delved and reacted in an attempt to polarize voters. Disillusionment awaits them if such things continue unabated as Bihar results have shown

                            Aamir' and Shah Rukh deserve our respect for sticking their neck out and speaking their minds. They could easily have kept quiet, they would have been well aware of the vicious trolls who descend to vicious and filthy personal attacks, they would have been aware BJP' S main streamed so called fringe will immediately question their patriotism and of course standard recommendation of BJP nowadays that : don't agree with us? Go to Pakistan. That they chose to speak up knowing the personal pain they are likely to be put through, shows their courage of conviction that should force the most die hard troll and bhakt to introspect. Who is hurting India' S image? Those who are ministers, mps, MLAs, party presidents, chief ministers of BJP who issue provocative and divisive statements day in and day out, the trolls who know no decency and who cannot address the issue itself so resort instead to personal attacks or the intellectuals and artists who are braving the vicious campaign against them to hold up a mirror to the govt. Asking them to act on their own rabblerousers occupying responsible positions?

How did you write these column?  Did ever anybody notice how many people were killed in Bengal under your government.  On the name secular, your government always play religion game. People in villages, they know the trur colour. You should not write anything.  If you write, people will just laugh.

                            Madame the fact that we as indians can speak our mind even if demeaning about our own nation, in our own nation, is tolerance enough. Please note we do not have a blasphamey law.<br/><br/>
Also how is the government responsible for a society? Is a society a community such a weak structure? It is us, who form the society and we define it. So if intolerance is "on the rise" is it we as a society to blame, or the government machinery?<br/><br/>
To maintain law and order, is not the responsibility or the government and law agencies alone, it is for all citizens as citizens. Hence I ask, why is this subject still burning? India has had decades of discriminatory activities through our history. Or is the disapora implying that all this is new and only due to the cause that Modi is PM? <br/><br/>
For an intellect such as you, that view is very myopic. Highly disappointed.

                            The election victory of Narendra Modi in 2014 gave a lot of people all over the country an affirmation that their bigotry and hatred are acceptable and justified sentiments and even that it is proof of their 'patriotism'. The corollary to this belief is that anyone who disagrees is either motivated or is seditious.<br/><br/>
The reason why Modi evokes such strong loyalty compared to his only BJP predecessor Vajpayee is precisely this. Unlike Vajpayee, Modi provides this largely unspoken respectability for hate and bigotry.<br/><br/>
Being the clever politician he is, Modi knows exactly why this hate brigade fanatically follows him. And that is the reason he will never speak up clearly and loudly against the foul acts and speech emanating from the saffron gangs. After all, has he ever unequivocally condemned what happened after Godhra even after 13 years?

As are many things with the Far Left, the very reality that the author finds opportunity to publish and receive accolades for articles such as this, without her family connections with this news entity being held against her liberty to do so, is contradictory to her position on the concerned subject.

Today they may target by religion, but once they are done they will come after people who are from particular part of India then it might be based on caste.

You and bloody so called pseudo-secular intellectuals are the main cause for intolerance, if at all if there is any, if in your beliefs there is intolerance then you have failed us,none of you so far have come out in the open to be specific and taken any damn initiatives to curtail or bring peace and harmony, instead you all have only continuing to escalate and waiting for the bubble to burst, so that you can claim, see this what we have been telling. Now let's talk about freedom of speech, the very platform he had used to make such a irresponsible statement and was not threatened by anybody goes to show how tolerant the society is, where were you when a certain community leaders issued fatwa against AR Rehman for composing music for the Iranian movie? Didn't you in your beliefs there is feel the society was intolerant, none of you jokers ever bother to raise or dared to do award waphsi, this damn double standard attitude is what  is causing the divide among the society.

                            I heard a lot of "freedom of speech" in favour of aamir khan. He is not just an "ordinary citizen". The person of his stature loses some kind of freedom of saying whatever comes to your mind publicly, the freedom of anonymity. He represents more. I'm not judging his statement wrong. But he should have been more cautious about what he was saying. He should have expected this kind of reaction about something as huge as "intolerance", when people react as they do, to some nondescript, silly, nonsensical, unimportant bollywood trivia. People do care about what he says.

                            Communist Party of India(Marxist) Action …….<br/>
1942- they openly opposed quit India movement just to appease Britain as they were soviet allies during world war II <br/>
1962 - They supported China during India-china war <br/>
1964- China conducted nuclear test and CPM supported them <br/>
1974 and 1998- when India conducted test, they opposed that by saying that we need nuclear free world. <br/>
2008- they opposed Indo-US nuclear deal. They opposed the deal saying that India's nuclear program will be halted and monitored and India cannot conduct nuclear test. Just see what they had said before when we conducted the test. <br/>
They are always anti-national in nature, always from the Development of Nation….. Example : Situation of West Bengal.

                            Brinda and all the "tolerant" persons commenting on intolerance, if you think India is intolerant, then is it only in BJP rule? The most number of communal riots, bomb explosions and Mumbai attacks have happened during Congress rule. Weren't you leaving in India then? Don't you realise your comments are disreputing India and India doesn't belong to only BJP or any other political party but to Indians. So when you're talking about "intolerance" in India, it shows your disloyalty to India and it's high time people like you are dragged to the court for the treason.

                            "It is a real issue today that a young couple in love with each other, one a Hindu the other a Muslim, are fearful of being lynched by those who spread hate in the name of love jihad. ".. Another joke... In a mix marriage, a Hindu always converted to the other religion.. not the another way.. :) Comrades are becoming more ignorant nowadays.
