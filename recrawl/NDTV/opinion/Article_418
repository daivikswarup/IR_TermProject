Headline::::General Amit Shah's Black Tuesday



DateTime::::2015-02-16T16:12:00+05:30




                                
	(Kumar Ketkar is a senior journalist, political commentator, globe trotter and author. He has covered all Indian elections since 1971 and significant international events. He is a frequent participant on TV debates.)
	Till, February 10, most of the print media published stories with headlines declaring a neck-and-neck fight in Delhi. The elite English TV channels also echoed that line, forecasting a "photo finish" or predicting that the BJP would score between 38 and 41 of a possible 70 seats.
	Even the bookies (safe to assume these were Gujarati satta operators) said a day before results were counted that after "carefully studying" the opinion polls, they believed the BJP had "recovered immensely."
	Over 100 MPs, nearly 2000 so-called foot-soldiers of the RSS, and all the shakhas outfits were mobilized. All the seven BJP MPs and all BJP corporators were summoned to join the "Hate Jihad" like the army issues orders to ex-Army men at the time of war. The "embedded" media men and women understood the "hukum" from the chieftain Amit Shah and began to circulate stories that there would be a last-minute swing, and there would be a surge in voting after 3 pm and all those votes would go the BJP because of the fantastic but invisible networking by the Sangh Parivar cadres.
	Each member of the Modi Brigade, some of them even flown in from US, was given booth-wise responsibilities. Social media, which was the main vehicle of the Sangh Parivar in the Lok Sabha election, was re-orchestrated by the Sangh Aparatchiks, as they had realized that it was dominated by AAP volunteers. U.S.-trained management experts who had choreographed the Tea Party campaign and Romney propaganda machine in America in 2012 were positioned to coordinate the Delhi cyberspace.
	The print media was flooded with full page color advertisements. Almost every hundred yards, there was a huge hoarding with the image of the messiah Modi. A quick visual estimate of the cost of campaign suggests no corners were cut. All the moralists who had written columns after columns about paid news and had rushed to the Election Commission earlier were quiet over this obscene expenditure which included buying a substantial section of the media.
	Indian diplomats from nearly 120 countries were specially invited to Delhi, presuming glorious victory in the election, so they could go back to their missions abroad, impressed and inspired by the miracle called Modi. But like in Stalingrad in 1941-42, every household joined the electoral war to defeat Modi-Shah's Panzer divisions.
	Even the "Best and the Brightest" in the media were awestruck by the Blitzkrieg. Their faith in the BJP's organizational capacity, their trust in the grand strategy of Amit Shah who was on a winning spree for the past nine months, their confidence in the so-called Modi Magic was so much that they had announced victory much before the morning of their Black Tuesday, when the leads started pouring in and getting flashed on the TV screens, resulting in an eerie silence in their intellectual and corporate drawing rooms.
	The celebrated columnist Surjit Bhalla, as my keen media watcher friend noted, put the AAP victory down to social disharmony - last month though (on Jan 24) he had written a profound analytical piece saying that a loss for BJP was impossible. AAP was not going to win more than 21 seats. Did social disharmony really set in over the last two weeks? Tavleen Singh purred that nothing much has really changed. Astonishing, no? What happened to the huge aspirational class, and the vast upwardly mobile urban community which Shekhar Gupta used to see in the BJP victory? The middle and higher middle class joined the ranks of the jhuggi jhopri walas to throw out the invading saffron armies. Their simple aspiration was to call the Modi bluff. And they did. Chetan Bhagat was eloquent in his post-facto wisdom.
	Then there emerged the theory that Shah, the great strategist, had planned the defeat all along in a systematic manner. Some referred to a news article in the Gulf News in January in which it was stated that the tacticians had worked out a plan to lose election. But it was clear to anyone who followed that thread, that it was actually a planned camouflage for an excuse, in case the election is lost. So if the BJP wins, it would be because of the magnificent war strategy and if it loses, it was part of the game plan!
	This was a loss, pure and simple. The General and strategy failed. Let it rest at that.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Why Ketkar is so happy? This shows his sadist mentality. Definitely he hasn't won this election. AAP is also not so happy because they understand what is this win all about. Be happy at a time when you should be, at this time also you look so cynical

                            Hi Kumar Ketkar,<br/><br/>
The irony is that the party you have supported is dusted and burried permanently. You should not derive sadistic pleasure of looking at BJP's defeat in my opinion.

                            Where are the paid Modi Brigade? , they are hiding their faces now. They are ashamed to come out of their holes. For the past 10 months they have made life miserable for any commentator who was neutral, they would use all kinds of dirty words and mudslinging on any one who would speak the truth. They even praised the comments of Sakshi Maharaj and Togadiya . Any body who would disagree with them they would brand him antinational or jehadi. Some of these paid goons will now be out of work. God save this country from the people who sell their souls

                            why do i see the similarities in mr.Iyer and Ketkar's Statments/opinions ! who wait !! Congi stooges! <br/>
being a hard core BJP follower, i am happy in a way AAP won, nobody(inc BJP) should be allowed to become too strong! Plus BJP was never strop in Delhi eitherways! <br/>
but what i fail to understand why is this a referendum against BJP? PM did four rallies which is on the lines of any state assemblies post 2014 ! so no difference, vote share more or less the same, what Ketkar is failing to see is ! real dream of CongMukhtBharat is inching closer and faster, than ever!<br/>
@AAP: lets work together to make a safer and greater Delhi!! Ideoligical Difference is always there But Common goal should unite us!

                            Ketkar, Modi-Shah promised 24 hr electricity, housing for all, water for all. But to their credit nothing was for free, the public will have to pay for the services they want. Kejriwal knows that Delhities want everything free so he promised free elec., free water, free housing and to boot it all free WiFi. I mean if people are so foolish to vote for anyone who offers them everything free then God save the country. Its good that Modi-Shah did not fall for the politics-of-free. Modi-Shah continue on the path of politics-of development, everyone with the right mindset will support you. And for Kejriwal he will find out what it takes to deliver on promises within a year's time. I am sure in 2yrs time if things fall in place Modi-Shah will have the last laugh. Modi-Shah be focused on one and only thing development and high speed delivery, its an era of 4G not bullock carts.

                            so you finally woke up after a week to publish this nonsense..FYI none of the poll predicted a victory for BJP it said close margin but still AAP getting comfortable majority..The vote difference is minimal in most of the place so its not a bad prediction..yes BJP lost but if you have seen the post poll analysis, the congress vote share went to AAP..yes Modi and BJP should think why congress votes went to AAP instead of BJP..time to pull up their socks and work what they promised before they get beaten in other states too..

                            Mr. Ketkar, it's true that the BJP got a score that's negligible. However, how many seats did the party that you support won during the same assembly election polls? Is that number more than what the BJP has scored? If your answer is NO, why don't you come up with such articles on the party that belong to, rather than enjoying the results of some other party? Or is it like you and your party are so shameless that scoring a big 0 doesn't make any difference to you? Looks like that's the case.

                            Indians are very happy if everything comes free. Politicians job is to give free power, water, tv, refrigerator, mixure grinder, house, furniture etc., etc., then charge the same on so called middle class and upper middle class. Finally what the politicians want is all should become low class and beg the political class with free bees. No work, eat whatever provided by the political class. We do not need education. What we need is free bees. Kelkar should be very happy. Because he does not lose anything. Our country's class and caste matrix suits people like him better. He should spend some time thinking and working out as to how the people in the private sector and unorganised sector live after their retirement age if they are only made to pay taxes for everything they earn. Anyway people employed in the Government and departments are provided with hefty pension after their retirement and even to their next generations(which they cannot eat but only deposit in the Bank for their future generations). First the staff of Government should be charged with hefty fees for lavish usage of all forms of amenities.

His own favoured party - the congress, has not given him any chance to be happy or pleased. So he has seized this opportunity to be happy.

                            Even experts are interpreting Delhi 2015 election as a great set back or decimation of BJP. Congress leaders like Sri. Mani Shanker Iyer and sympathizers like Mr.Ketkar are rejoicing and deriving sadistic pleasure at the loss of BJP, rather than writing an obituary note for Congress, which is on life support systems.The truth in terms of vote share and voting pattern analysis, BJP is where it was in 2013. In fact, it obtained 1 lakh more votes at 27 lakh, with 32% vote share. Its core support base is intact. The sweeping of this election by AAP is due whole sale transfer of Congress (14%) and BSP  Vvotes (4%) to AAP. This transfer has taken place as this election is some what on presidential pattern, therefore the contests  shifted from being triangular (2013) to a strait contest between BJP and AAP.. The usual anti govt./ BJP vote did not split as it generally takes place. Theoretically, if one out of every 5 AAP supporters shift their loyalty to BJP in future, they will get equal number of votes and seats in next election. This is not impossible given the transient nature of voters loyalty and quirkiness of Indian election system.

                            I thought Mr.Ketkar was only supporter of congress, it looks like he is more a BJP hater. God Bless him. <br/><br/>
If Ketkar and other political analysts look into the vote share carefully,<br/>
certainly BJP has lost only 1.3% of its vote share and congress has lost around 25% vote share and with lot of difficulty it has managed to get 0 seats. if there was anything as -ve seats it would have got -70 (on lighter side). So most of the vote share of congress has gone to AAP. And Fatwa my minority leader has made minority voters en-mass vote for AAP. This is kind of political adjustment. So no issues this is all part of political game. But Mr.Ketkar is blind hater and No-Reason supporter of Congress. And opportunist opinion writer on behalf of AAP.<br/><br/>
Good Luck AAP. Hope Delhi citizens and lucky enough to get free/subsidized power and water,

                            Each and every word written by Kumar Ketkar is true. The analysis of parties, the process, strategies, the role of media &amp; few old created media thinkers is phenomenal. This must be read and debated by the people if they are to realize REAL FREEDOM.

                            Somewhere these strategists forget that we are a democracy and the power ultimately lies with the people. People like Shah can spend all their money on ads and other propaganda, but the voter is bound to realise one day the truth.<br/>

                            After elections the knives are always out ... just this time even the journalists are fair game. The common man should realise that there is nothing called neutral press, earlier we got to know about the people who were close to Congress, then the AAP sympathisers got exposed and now it is the turn of the BJP mouthpieces to come under the public scanner. The nexus between the political parties and the media persons was always there and they use their power to influence people. Every thing was smooth as long as it was only print but now with 24/7 visual media and so much competition they are fighting amongst themselves and squealing on each other.

                            Kumar ketkar is a strong and staunch follower of Mani Shankar Iyer. So I need not tell you all about his views on any subject and the quality of his blogs. You should have seen him on TV when the LS election results in May of 2014 were being announced. That was a treat to watch his squirming and his expressions changing every microsecond. Now Kumar Ketkar has regained his energy after the Delhi election results....

                            Dear commentators I want to tell you, see the media how they change the mindset of the people through poring wrong notions about public opinion. This is media they only show you the columnists, celebrities or others who are experts in this field to control the mind of some people. But people is people, no one can take them for ride. Jai Ho Delhi for choosing what you wanted to be and hope your expectations would be delivered.

                            I think Mr Amit Shah and BJP were well aware of the fact that all is not well with Delhi, but the show must go on and one has to say something for that.All the predictions conducted were very far away from there predictions, giving AAP a massive victory.<br/>
 These "ups" and "downs" are well thought in any party,and corrective measures are taken.<br/>
 I remember Mr.Maughms story "the Ailen Corn " when Ketkar writes.
