Headline::::He Died on Diwali Inside a Sewage Pipe



DateTime::::2015-11-20T16:55:00+05:30




                                In a few days, on the 29th of November, a group of four safai karmacharis (sweepers) and three beldars (diggers) along with three more senior persons, all working for the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), will be returning from a week-long official trip to Japan and South Korea where they are learning first-hand about sanitation, cleanliness, waste disposal as well as the maintenance of urban colonies, markets etc. The NDMC Chairman, Naresh Kumar, said, "We took the decision to boost their morale".
The NDMC would achieve real morale-boosting if it implemented the stringent safety regulations which govern sanitary work in those countries.
 
A week before the team of workers departed, one of their colleagues who, unlike them, was a contract sanitary worker for the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), had died inside a pipe in the Keshopur Sewage Treatment Plant while repairing a leak.
Vinay Sirohi, only 22 years old, was a high school graduate who was pursuing his graduation ''privately''. His mother, a widow, also works at the same plant. Vinay was married to Rachna only 11 months ago and had wanted to spend Diwali at home but left reluctantly saying that he would be back by 3.00 pm, before the celebrations began.
At 2.00 pm, his family was informed that he had gone missing. His body was found the next day after the police used gas cutters to cut through the pipe.
 
According to the rules, Sirohi should have been accompanied by two other workers when he entered the pipeline, but he went in alone; he should have been wearing a helmet, a face mask and gum boots with a safety rope around his waist, but he went in bereft of all these. A newspaper report said that ''following the incident, officials of the Sewage Treatment Plant are likely to issue an advisory for operators and workers about the safety precautions to be taken''. That should do a lot for their morale!
 
Deaths like Vinay Sirohi's occur almost every day and are reported in the papers in small paragraphs that are hard to find. The fact that he died so young on Diwali, a day of joyous celebration, made his death poignant enough to merit a few headlines and photographs of his grieving wife and mother in several dailies in the National Capital. TV channels also covered the ''event''. Had they taken the trouble to show their viewers how he died, it might have shocked many into demanding real change in the lives of sanitation workers. The fact that what happened was happening in the National Capital may have brought the reality behind the facade of the Swachh Bharat campaign home to many.
 
Sanitation workers who clean out sewage blockages have to immerse themselves in a hell-hole. Once in, they are assaulted by a ''sudden blast of putrid sludge - besides methane, hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide''. A worker who has been there and back says ''Even if we manage not to swallow the toxic muck, it manages to enter our bodies'' (from the Drishti documentary "Lesser Humans").
 
In 2005, a study of sewer workers titled ''Hole to Hell'' was conducted by the Center for Education and Communication (CEC), Delhi. Dr Ashish Mittal, an Occupational Health physician who co-authored the report, says, "A manhole is a confined, oxygen-deficient space where the presence of noxious gases can cause syncope - a sudden and transient loss of consciousness... the long term neurological effects of syncope can be debilitating". In developed countries, like the ones the sanitation workers from Delhi are currently visiting, the sewers are well-lit and aerated with huge fans and the workers are protected by bunny suits and respiratory apparatus. In Delhi, the workers wear a belt connected with thick ropes to men outside but this offers them no protection against gases and sharp objects that assault them inside. Poor Vinay did not even have a rope. During Mittal's six-month study using 200 workers, three of them died. The average age of sanitary workers is said to be 45 years.
 
A 2007 article in Tehelka magazine estimated that there are at least 1,43,000 sewer workers in urban India. Assuming a Mortality Rate of 25 for this group, 3,575 sewer workers die every year, 10 every day. (According to Visaria, member of the advisory council of the Population Foundation of India, Tehelka's is a ''very conservative'' projection.)
 
The Government of India is holding a special two-day session of Parliament on November 25-26 to honour Dr BR Ambedkar whose 125th birth anniversary falls on April 14 next year. It would be most appropriate if the inhuman exploitation of sanitation workers is discussed and condemned in this session and immediate steps taken to bring their working conditions to the level prevailing in civilised countries. Otherwise, the workers returning from Japan and Korea and hundreds of thousands like them will find little to ''boost their morale''. They will only be confronted with images of other Vinays and other grieving widows, mothers and children.(Subhashini Ali is former MP, former Member of the National Commission for Women and Vice President of the All India Democratic Women's Association.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Really unfortunate. But no one is interested in it. First, it is in AAP ruled state so media wants to shy away and secondly, it cannot be converted into a Dadri like issue.

                            Hats off to Subhasini Ali for this article.  Wouldn't the lives of the workers at the very bottom of our society, such as Vinay improve dramatically if instead of paying photo-op visits to dalit houses in far flung places, Rahul Gandhi actually spent time with a Vinay like character and have actual experience of the work they do?  He would not need to go on Vipasnas or other foreign trips to assess their plight!

                            Thanks a lot Madam, his death on Diwali, with a young wife waiting for him at home, brought tears to my eyes. Yes you are right, we as a country and citizens have failed him and his family. We should be ashamaed that we have no respect for fellow human beings and "dignity of lobor' is absent in our culture. Since his (Vinays) is a "Dirty" job, we cant care less.  Moreovoer what with all of us aggressively preocuupied with vilifying each others religion,value systems and belief, how can we have time to spare for such souls. Shame on us Indians.

                            This is an important issue you pointed out madam. Indeed, parliamentarians need to discuss such issues, and make laws so that these incidences do not repeat; rather than fighting among each other for their own greed.

                            Felt pained to read this article. I can't imagine the moments when his wife would be wating for Diwali Celebrations and got a news of her husbands death. Got goose bumps to read and feel the pain.<br/><br/><br/>
Real tribute for this would be that GOI introduce big reforms and allocate big budget towards improving the work Conditions of sanitry workers in the special session of parloament.<br/><br/>
With the target of One Year every sanitoy worker must get all(Masks,Head Gears,gloves) what they need to keep them safe from hazadeous gases <br/><br/>
GOI should immidiately provide Govt job to her wife <br/><br/>
Hope special session will be a boon and historic beginning to improve the life of sanitory workers in India

                            Really sad and unfortunate. It is a fact that in India safety norms are hardly being followed while doing work. People responsible for this negligence should be brought to book. However, the concern coming from a communist smacks of hypocrisy as communists have been the worst offenders as far as violence and intolerance goes.

                            Ms Subhashini Ali is wise to highlight the plight of poor workers without whom we may be living in utter filthy urban lanes. I urge the news channels to highlight this issue in their prime time instead of airing useless political sludge. I am sure people of India would appreciate it.

                            We are seriously need looking into Health and Safety law in our country. It is really high time we enforce the health and safety law on the company before anymore Vinay dies. Thank you Ms Subhasini Ali to put this article and draw people's attention to it. Media should really need to show all this than stupid patty politics every where. <br/><br/>
We are the front runner of developing nation if you like but only country where the Health and Safety is still taken for granted and no emphasis on it.

                            Please educate people on OHSAS... ISO 18000.<br/>
Simply wearing face masks is NOT ENOUGH !!!<br/>
These are enclosed spaces and at most times.....gas filled and oxygen depleted.<br/>
The spaces require gas freeing, continuous ventilation (Force Draft) and Gas free certification prior entry.<br/><br/>
The problem is that even with repeated accidents.... we do not learn. Even if a procedure is in place, no effort is made in ensuring the same is conducted as should be.<br/><br/>

                            Emotions apart..overall most of the people in the south asian countries have lackside attitude towards the safety. People don't learn unless the incident happens to them. Sometime it will be too late. This looks to be case here too.

                            In India human life is cheap. Especially of the poor. Ali belongs to the CPM. She should be fighting for better working conditions. Armchair protests do not work. Writing articles does not solve these issues. Shows the hypocrisy latent in the CPM. Launch a struggle for these people. Then maybe things will improve.

                            It is a tragedy that safety rules are ignored at all levels and we read stories of people being killed or maimed repeatedly. No body seems to get any wiser even after the events. The higher ups do not keep standard and good quality safety equipment to start with, it is also true that people concerned regularly neglect to use them. I have seem people not using safety glasses or safety boots cut at the ankles as they feel uncomfortable using ankle boots. Even when there is a helmet on the head of the rider of a two wheeler, most of them don't buckle up and the straps are seen hanging on the sides. The authorities need to come heavily on the higher ups and also on those who refuse or wrongly use the safety equipment. <br/>

Heard it is not limited to sanitation , even oil drilling companies hardly follows global safety standard..so many death on offshore oil platform in mega Modi sponsor company

                            A request to Govt. Stop 7th Pay Commission for underworked and overpaid Govt. Employees except armed forces. Trust me, no body will leave their govt job because of complacence and poor skills along with job security. 1st pay attention to poor working conditions of lower rung, organised and poor daily wagers, farmers and contract labourers. Chalta hai attitude of incompetent administrators at executive and legislature has killed thousands of them. Yogendra Yadav is right in advocating an income commission for poor workers.
