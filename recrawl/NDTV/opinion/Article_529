Headline::::The Danger of Treating Children As Adults



DateTime::::2015-04-28T20:30:00+05:30




                                Recently I have been thinking about a news story I read in 2013: a five-year old boy accused of stealing was thrashed by a mob - 'the public'; later, at the police station, electric shocks were apparently applied to his ears to get him to confess; and eventually, a Juvenile Justice Board (JJB, the adjudicating authority for children accused of committing offenses) instead of dismissing the case, released him on bail, meaning that they thought it necessary to carry on proceedings against a five-year old. One would have assumed that the only worthwhile prosecution in this matter would have been of the police, and the mob that tortured and abused the little boy. And that the JJB would have exercised common sense, or at the very least read the Indian Penal Code and known that a child of five cannot and should not be held criminally responsible.
 
But no.
 
What I learnt from that story is this: functionaries of the state - the police as well as magistrates - and the public at large cannot always be trusted to recognize who a child is, and how he is to be treated - even when he is only five. For clearly, when presented with knowledge of an offense, even a minor one, the ability of otherwise normal people to have a rational, reasoned, and dare I say, human response, was overshadowed by their outrage at wrongdoing.  
 
No small wonder then that we find ourselves where we are today. A country baying for blood. The blood of young people accused of committing heinous crimes.
 
Any minute now, a new Juvenile Justice Bill will be tabled in Parliament. Ignoring the Parliamentary Standing Committee's comprehensive report and rejection of the Government's position, the new Juvenile Justice Act will allow for the transfer of children between the ages of 16-18 who are alleged to have committed heinous crimes to the adult criminal justice system. Here, they will be treated as adults, will live among adult criminals, and serve sentences that can include imprisonment for decades. Juvenile Justice Boards, yes, bodies just like the one that could not see past its rigid mindset to protect a five-year-old, will now be given the task of determining the cognitive, emotional and psychological maturity of children who stand accused before them - accused, mind you, not guilty. They will have the power to find certain children to not be children any more, and to deem them undeserving of the protection guaranteed by law. How JJBs will conduct this assessment of maturity is wholly unclear, and, according to psychologists and mental health experts, including eminent ones from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), is actually impossible to do. In a country with only 2,500 trained psychiatrists, getting 'expert' advice to the JJB as proposed by the Act might be the stuff of fantasy.
 
As a practitioner who has worked closely with the juvenile justice system and with children in conflict with law for many years, it's frightening to imagine what the future looks like for young people. To understand my fears, consider this:
 
Between February-May 2013, my organization spoke to 264 boys in conflict with law detained in 31 Observation Homes, and this is what we learnt:
 
72% of children said they had been kept in a police lock-up prior to being presented before the JJB, with 38% reporting it was for as long 7-10 days, in complete contravention of the law.
 

While in police custody, 45% of children were physically abused, another 27% were kept hand cuffed, and 31% said they had been verbally intimidated and threatened. Some of the more extreme stories involved allegations of being forced to make confessions after being ruthlessly beaten, and being extorted for large sums of money in exchange for release. The beatings happened late at night, and iron rods and wet leather belts were used. As an aside, one must note here that international studies suggest that young people are more likely than others to be coerced into making false confessions because they are more susceptible to pressure, intimidation, fear, misunderstanding procedures and questions, and therefore are thought to have a reduced ability to be fit for trial in adult courts.
 

75% of children said that the JJB had not asked them any questions nor made any attempt to listen to their account of the alleged offence. "They don't even raise their eyes to look at us" was the complaint made by one young boy.
 

More worryingly, some boys said that when the Board did speak to them, it was to urge them to confess to the crime. "Did you commit the crime? Confess and you will get bail quickly" was a sentiment many boys heard.
Highlighting systemic failure at this juncture is, I know, fraught with risk. For it speaks loudest to an audience that is sickened by dysfunction and already has little or no faith in the juvenile justice system. I take the risk advisedly. Because it's crucial for us to think about the policemen who will be framing the charges that will determine whether a heinous offense was actually even committed.
It's crucial to think about the JJBs, many of whom have shown little interest in the children before them, who will be conducting enquiries that will change a child's future unutterably. A child, who at the point when the decision is made to transfer him, might well even be innocent. It's crucial to think about what will happen to the many young boys accused of serious offenses like rape and kidnapping and forced confinement, charges pressed on them by irate fathers who can't bear the thought that their daughter dared to run away or have a relationship with a boy of her own choosing, sometimes crossing caste and religious boundaries. Whose side will these functionaries of justice take, do you think? And the result? - long sentences of up to 20 years for teenagers who dared to love.
 
Let's be realistic, this law is going to bring a vast swathe of youngsters into its ambit. To insulate ourselves by thinking that it will be implemented with surgical precision to target only those who have 'shocked our conscience' with their alleged brutality, is to be ostrich-like. In a country as riven as ours with inequality and prejudice of every kind, the imminent passage of this potentially dangerous Bill must force a moment of cool reflection.  
 
We have given nothing to our young people. No care, no protection, no education, no opportunity, no hope. Just a twisted adult world in which they must negotiate survival, exploitation, hard labour, violence and abuse. Having stripped children off their childhood, we are ready now to punish them for it. It's Kafkaesque.
 
A paucity of imagination on the part of successive governments and a cynical manipulation of the public's justifiable anger at a culture of impunity and violence will now result in us taking a giant step backwards in our commitment to children and young people. While simultaneously making the world safer for nobody. There is a vast body of empirical evidence from other countries who have succumbed to similar pressures and treated their children as adults to show that this is a failed experiment.
 
Juvenile Justice privileges reformation as a primary goal over long-term incarceration because it is understood that young people are more amenable to reform.Therefore, both from a child rights as well as a pragmatic perspective, focusing on correction is the only real way to strike at the root of reoffending (and thence public safety) in the long term.(Atiya Bose is the director of Aangan, an Indian non-profit organization that works with children in dangerous situations like child trafficking, child marriage, hazardous work, and violence and abuse, to prevent and protect them from harm.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Madam, you're mixing things up and trying to confuse people. You're citing police aberration on a five-year-old CHILD to debate about "most extreme" and "heinous" crimes as rape+murder committed by 16-18 year-olds, who are by no means "children".

                            Ms Atiya the new law of changing age from 18 to 16 is absolutely right, as it is only for the heinous crime. If a juvenile can do such a heinous crime like adult he has to be stopped there otherwise he will become a serial criminal.<br/>
Ms Atiya haven't you interviewed any juvenile who has done rapes and then brutal murder.

                            If you can commit an adult crime like murder or rape then you can't expect to be treated as a child. The JJB intends to treat such criminal's as adults. There is no intention in the law to treat 5 yr old's as adults so stop misguiding and writing articles just because you are a 5 star activist.

                            What you mentioned on the onset is of a 5 year old child. But then, even a 17 year old is treated as a 'child'. Don't you think that there should be an appreciation of this fact?

                            It is precisely because of bleeding hearts like Atiya that our streets are unsafe.  Not one mention of the so called juvenile in the Nirbhaya case; not one mention of the photo-journalist in the Mumbai gang-rape case.  The two victims in these cases did not deprive any child of anything.  Yet the 'juvenile' in the Nirbhaya case deprived her of the fundamental right to live.  By all accounts, he was the cruellest of the sadists.  As far as I am concerned, if a person is capable of ejaculating, he is capable of rape.  If he is capable of rape, he is capable of taking punishment, even if that is the death penalty.

                            The first portion about the mob's mad treatment to a five-year old and the police brutality to the child, despite there being the JJB and the law not taking any action, is worrying. However, this does not justify the author's opposition to the proposed law, that for heinous crimes like rape / murder etc. committed by 16-18 year-olds they would be tried based on their purported assessment of maturity level by JJB. After all, the age of 18 is a normative barrier (based on probable age by which a person is expected to be mature enough). In fact, the Juvenile Justice system is being misused by the criminals (by producing birth-certificates to show that they were as low as one-day younger than 18 years). The crux of the problem lies with our legal system, which neither exonerates anyone of the crime or hold them guilty (such a long process with the accused invariably getting bail, even though there is almost 100% evidence against the person for crimes committed in broad day-light with our ingenious lawyer's connivance, so that they can be scot-free to continue to commit the crimes). There are cases, like the one, where one innocent poor labourer waiting for a local train late at night in Mumbai was taken into custody by the police on suspicion- possibly with good intention, but the person was in custody for more than a week, due to the magistrate not being present on one day / not able to take up the case the next day due to his pre-occupation / the concerned constable being on leave another day; before fortunately releasing the person after a week without framing any charges). The issue here is not whether the culprit is under-age or over-age but about whether the crime committed by the person (child / adult) is one which the person committed through innocence (obviously heinous crimes cannot be out of innocence) and thus requiring to be treated as committed by a child; or committed by the person fully conscious of what he is doing (but get away through the juvenile loop-hole).

                            Absolutely stupid article. No one will want to punish children for lesser crimes like theft etc. it is only heinous crimes like rape and murder that the 16 year olds will be tried as adults. The writer is misleading the public. 16 year olds who commit rape MUST be treated and punished as adults including getting the death penalty

                            Dr. Bose should understand the difference between the age 5 and 16 first. Those who are committing those fearful crimes at the age of 16, do you think it will be a justice to keep them away from the catch of the law just by arguing '...only 2,500 trained psychiatrists...'? In those countries where they have psychiatrists more than their national requirements, do we think that there is no such crimes in those places? Wrong. It is all in the fact that our children are growing faster than time now-a-days. Therefore, the new law is a timely one. However, the chances of getting an innocent, convicted or forcefully confessed remaining same before and after the new law. And those 16 years who are committing these crimes are well aware and mature to decide their own fate consciously in most of the cases.

                            If you are old enough to rape or murder, then you are old enough to be tried for it. The job of the criminal justice system is to keep law abiding citizens safe. Does our legal system protect citizens or criminals? An offence committed by a juvenile creates the same impact as that of an adult. All the issues raised in the article are old hat, and raised regularly by bleeding heart liberals. One of the criminals who assaulted Nirbhaya was a few years younger than the rest, and reportedly the cruelest. He received 3 years probation and the others the noose. Why? It is high time that the country stopped trying to reform criminals and instead tries to keep society safe for its citizens. Anyone over 16 and convicted of a heinous crime has to face the same punishment as an adult. Concerns about misuse arise during implementation of any law. It would be better to teach the youth about obeying societies laws and customs and the consequences if they did not, rather than plead on their behalf after they have committed grave offences.

                            Madam,its easy to play the devil's advocate from your cozy slice of heaven.It's only when the devil pays a visit to your own sweet little home,you will have a sudden change of opinion. I 'm sure you will bay for blood from even a 10yr old , if he so much as flicks a pebble on your kids...much less rape or harm them.Crimes is a crime, no matter how you look at it. If it can be proved a child has done a crime on his own accord , he is liable to be punished.if he is adult  enough to rape , he is adult enough to bear punishment for it. <br/>
And as regards Love ,  no one said loving is easy !!

                            Don't mix up the issues. If a 16 yr old is capable of committing heinous crimes which even majority of adult criminals are not capable of, then they should be tried under normal adult laws. In fact, this age limit is to be brought down further to 12 for crimes like violent rapes and premeditated murders. Even a murder committed in a fit of anger, which is culpable homicide, cannot be compared to a rape, which can only be committed with full knowledge of the consequences. In fact if a juvenile committing a violent rape is treated with kid gloves and let off after max 3 years, he would return to society as a much more hardened and dangerous criminal.

I have only one question to the author and one single argument which will answer everything. How many of the activists including herself (whose hearts are bleeding for the rights of murderers and rapists) will like to employ such beasts as domestic helpers (or even better) or employ them to take care of their own children?<br/><br/>
If she is OK to do that then I am with her.

                            If the children remain children by all means the it is fine to treat them as children .Though i agree that a 5 year old being punished for stealing severely is not right but that cannot be equated on same lines to a heinous and devilish crimes like rape.. In such crimes  if 16 year old behaves like an adult and engages in such heinous activities he is by no means deserving the treatment of a child.

                            Ensuring and enhancing the quality of the process of the juvenile correctional services would bring about justice to juveniles in conflict with the laws. Sole measure of stipulating stringent laws against the juveniles would only promote injustice to the juveniles, who are the products of the society, which is driven by the ambiguous value systems.

                            The Author has expressed her experiences and it is unfortunate that there were systemic failures in handling the juveniles.This needs to be rectified.<br/>
Present bill which is likely to be placed in Parliament refers to the Age of 16 to 18,which should not be a problem as these days at the age of 16 a person is sufficiently matured enough to discriminate good and bad.<br/>
For instance in the case of Nirbhaya in Delhi, it was the juvenile,who did maximum damage to the life of the lady.Pleading innocence for such persons is totally unacceptable and in my opinion Government is absolutely right in bringing the bill. This refers to crimes of brutal nature or of henious nature.

No matter even if it is a child they should not be expected to turn around and change just because they are considered as child and given a chance to rectify, a life lost because of their heinous crime cannot come back, and you say madam that we should expect them to have done such heinous crimes without any intention or criminal thoughts.

                            While I agree with u, I just cannot fathom how a guy who has the capacity to brutally rape and murder a girl be treated as juvenile. If the person is capable of doing this at this age I shudder to think what he will be capable later on.

                            To be honest the so called psychological science we are practicing is very primitive. It is the reason we are unable to find the solution for all the recent problems in our society. We are trying to solve the problem in the reverse direction. I feel the adult of this generation are having the minds of the children(that is the real problem - it is because most of them have been abused as a child). We are unable to even fathom the root cause of these problems in our society and eradicate it because they have developed very strong roots in the society already.

                            Why dont you employ such juvenile monsters at your home around your daughter or son or parents to re-rehabilitate them. Dont be slave to missionaries for grants.  What will be your response if a so called juvenile monster kills your loved one ? Will you still lecture others on 'cognitive' abilities. Damn! Be real. We dont want no leftist liberals.

                            Even in cases of Murder I can give the benefit of doubt, that it could have been involuntary act committed in the heat of the moment.<br/><br/>
If a male (child or otherwise) is biologically capable of rape, he is not a child.  <br/><br/>
As a male, I am shocked by the number of women activists who are acting like ostriches on this issue, talking about every thing except this.<br/><br/>
Someone rightly said (though in a different context) 'women are the biggest enemies of women'.

                            Leave Ms. Atiya Bose to the mercy of the juvenile Delhi gang rape criminal. She will understand what you mean by juvenile and adult.

                            Wow! I see so much intolerance in the comments towards views of the author and some others on the thread. <br/>
A lot of the intolerance coming from misunderstanding the essence of what the author is saying. In fact so many comments are just rhetorical or just belligerent due to strong bias toward one side or the other. A lot of the arguments in the comment thread are also not rational and well informed. The literate but ill-informed  irrationals in India are derailing an extremely important discussion. Of-course this not everyone on the thread. <br/><br/>
The Author has said two things in my view: <br/>
1) Listen to the experts when deciding on an age of maturity. Of course it would be nice to do a scientific assessment of the maturity of every subject and then temper the punishment or reform regimen based on it. But that may not be practical, so we have to think what is the best practical way to do it. <br/><br/>
2) Reform ourselves and the arms of the government and judiciary ASAP to be un-biased, rational and have some common sense at the very least.
