Headline::::I'm Not Giving Up On Fighting Section 377



DateTime::::2016-01-15T14:20:00+05:30




                                Most Indians would agree that your sexual preferences, sexuality, and partner should be your choice. Unfortunately the prevailing law of the land - drafted by Victorian-era Englishmen in 1860 - doesn't agree. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code gives the state the authority to tell you what you can and cannot do in your bedroom.
Section 377 makes any sex apart from penile-vaginal intercourse between a man and a woman - any sex the authorities in power decide is "against the order of nature" - to be illegal.
Obviously this impacts the LGBTQ community, whose idea of what is "natural" reflects their sexual orientation. But it also impacts married heterosexual couples since theoretically, an act of oral sex between a husband and a wife is also illegal. And if you're not married to each other, of course, it's worse. If Bill Clinton had been an Indian, he might have survived impeachment after the Monica Lewinsky affair, but he'd have ended up in jail under Section 377.
I'm not just being frivolous. Though heterosexual prosecutions under 377 are rare indeed, we shouldn't have a law on the books that can be used to oppress and harass innocent people conducting their personal lives in private. What two people do to express their love and desire for each other should be strictly between them.
578 people were arrested last year for offences under Section 377. That's 578 people too many.
Section 377 should be amended so that all consensual sex between consenting adults, irrespective of gender and sexuality, is legal. But it should not legitimize forced sex, pedophilia or pederasty. That's why I drafted a Private Member's Bill that would have amended the law to do just that, but bigots from the ruling party defeated my attempt even to introduce my Bill in Parliament.
The BJP member who led the successful move to thwart my Bill spoke about Indian family values that he claimed would be undermined if Section 377 were amended. He quoted selectively from a Supreme Court judgement that struck down an earlier ruling by the Delhi High Court that Section 377 was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court, in fact, argued that it was the business of the legislature, not the judiciary, to scrap or amend the law.
I had been one of the MPs who openly welcomed the Delhi High Court's 2009 ruling and lamented the Supreme Court's decision to reverse it in December 2013. There was only time for a short two-week legislative session before the election code of conduct kicked in, in early March 2014, so the UPA Government was unable to introduce such a Bill. I waited a year and five parliamentary sessions for the BJP Government to initiate action, then realized they were not going to. So I decided to take matters into my own hands, in the hope of forcing the Government to pay attention. 
Attention has clearly been paid, but in the wrong way. The introduction of a bill is fairly routine - it is only at the discussion stage that I had anticipated opposition. Friday afternoons, when private members' bills are introduced and discussed, is usually quiet with a bare quorum in attendance, and many MPs leaving early to travel to their constituencies for the weekend. So I was taken aback when an unexpected challenge was mounted and the BJP was able to round up 74 MPs on a Friday afternoon to block the Bill's introduction. I learned later that a lot of homophobic comments were made privately by BJP MPs in the House and personal aspersions cast on me as well, but I've learned in politics to develop a thick skin, and I haven't wasted my time thinking about that.
The opposition to my Bill confirms that there's a lot of bigotry and homophobia around, allied to a deep-rooted hypocrisy that acknowledges the reality of homosexuality so long as gays don't express it openly. This is not just partisan politics. I believe the BJP is divided on the issue with some members, both senior and junior, in favour of decriminalization. Some of the BJP members who were most active that day were as keen on putting their liberal rivals within the BJP in their place, as they were in opposing a Congress MP. But though there were some BJP sympathizers for my Bill, they were cowed by the vocal bigots into acquiescence.
However, I'm not giving up.
I will resubmit the Bill in the next session, and try to get some support for it in advance, unlike last time. But obviously, if the BJP, with its crushing majority in the Lok Sabha, decides to oppose decriminalization, there's little that can be done before the next elections. The Opposition just doesn't have the numbers, and we have our share of prejudiced MPs too.
In the meantime, I am circulating a petition - to build public support to amend Section 377. If enough of us speak up, perhaps we can make the Prime Minister rethink Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
What I am hoping is for an open debate on the issue. I think parliament needs to hear - and the nation must hear it said in parliament - that this is not about sex but about freedom. Section 377 violates our constitutional rights of dignity, privacy, and equality (Articles 14, 15 and 21). It is a British relic, drafted in 1860 and based on outdated Victorian morals. It has no place in a modern nation like India.
 
I strongly feel that fair-minded people must be given a chance to educate themselves on this issue through a parliamentary debate. For instance, do MPs know that a 2014 study by the World Bank on "The Economic Cost of Homophobia in India" has revealed that India suffers a loss between 0.1 to 1.7% of GDP because of homophobia? Or that Section 377 costs the nation between $712 million to $23.1 billion in health costs (HIV, depression and suicides)? There's a price to be paid for bigotry, and the whole nation is paying it.(Dr Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Your writing is thoughtful and defends human rights of minorities in India.  Glad that we have parliamentarians like Tiruchi Siva  and Tharoor.

                            mr tharoor should star worrying more about the FBI report confirming Sunanda was poisoned. He should defend himself in sunanda case 1st. he will have lot's of free time to write books on section 377 or why BJP MP's attend parliament on Tuesday's, Thursday's or Friday's in Jail. some one is going to jail. Karma is always a knacks back.

                            Mr. Tharoor now start facing PUSH AND PULL TEST from Modi. Now Bhim Sain Bassi will be only deployed on you.<br/>
Modi will not hunt Cingress for 1984 as there is chance of shouts of 2002 from Congress. SO THAT PACT ALWAYS BE HONORED but you will be spent for Kerala elections. <br/>
ONLY WAY LEFT JOIN MODI-SHAH to have clean chit.

                            It is natural for a congresswallah to blame the BJP. How many of Tharoor's own congressmen are willing to support striking down of section 377? Tharoor should remember that every MP is entitled to his opinion and these cannot be forced. Indians have always been traditional and conservative in their views. Better he starts an education campaign in parliament first. Good luck to him.

                            Wow sir you have time for this article 377 issue and what about your (late)wife's murder case. You always give priority to these issues which always gives indication that you are least bothered about your (late)wife murder case, so should we think you really like article 377 so you are happy without your wife now are you going to become gay???

                            Keep fighting sir. It was disgraceful the way the elected members of the parliaments behaved toward you and toward the LGBTQ community. It was an insult to the whole electorate in fact. So do not give up. We will do what we can. We have signed the change.org petition. So we have you reach the target. The hopes of so many people are now tied with your fight. Dont give up sir. Jai Hind.

                            Good on you Tharoor and keep fighting.  You will have plenty of time when you are serving time in Tihar for the Sunanda murder.  Please be careful though!  As a South Indian you are fairly small compared to say the average sardarjee serving time in Tihar.  Make sure you are well lubricated as 377 or no 377 such characters are bound to have their evil way with you in Tihar!

                            Sir, Sasi, it is appeared to be "liberal" and "progressive" to fight for sexual preferences. But please remember it is dirty, filthy and disgusting to argue for this "filthy cause".

                            To be in political news a politician has to take up some cause or the other.  To escape from the heat on other personal issues also Shahi Taroor needs some issue to rake up and cry wolf if things go against him.

                            It is appalling that the 'liberals' never saw this as a violation of rights for last 6 decades.  Or may be they were sleeping all this while assuming the Congress government will take care of these issues suo moto.  That apart, it is even worse that your attempt though late, was defeated by our MPs.   It is evident that Indians are still not free in the correct sense.

                            Why he is not arrested yet.  What would have happened to an ordinary citizen or an AAP MLA in such a case??  Why judiciary and police have different rules for people in power and for poor helpless ordinary citizens.  Shashi Tharoor is trying to change the attention.  Why no Lie Detection Test on him.  He should have been in the forefront asking for a speedy enquiry.  He is smiling, attending conferences, writing books...business as usual for him.
