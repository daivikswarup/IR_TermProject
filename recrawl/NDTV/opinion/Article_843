Headline::::Ram Madhav Gives the Game Away



DateTime::::2015-09-22T13:47:00+05:30




                                Methinks Ram Madhav doth protest too much. Objecting in The Indian ExpressÂ to the concern being expressed in several quarters at the spectacle of the Prime Minister and virtually his entire cohort of ministers queuing up at the three-day RSS meet to pay obeisance to their masters, Madhav denies that the RSS are the BJP's string-pullers and says the RSS limits itself to playing the role of an "ideological fountainhead" to the "Sangh Parivar, a family of organizations (that) is essentially an ideological parivar".
Perhaps. But what is this ideology that all BJP leaders of any importance must subscribe to in order to remain members in good standing of the RSS, not forgetting that Modi himself is an RSS pracharak, and is bound by the "discipline" which the RSS stipulates as an overwhelming condition of membership?
The ideology goes back to a young Congressman, KS Hedgewar, emerging from incarceration for his part in the 1921-22 satyagraha, totally disillusioned with Gandhi's non-violence, incensed with him for having linked freedom for India with the Khilafat movement, angered at Gandhi refusing to base his political programme on "cow protection", and convinced that unless Hindus as a community banded together militantly and distanced themselves from the Muslims, India would remain forever in chains, or in thrall to a Muslim Raj. His organizational motto was "discipline", but he felt himself lacking in a coherent ideology until he chanced upon the writings of VD Savarkar, in particular a hand-written copy of Hindutva.
First and foremost, Savarkar held that the Hindus were "a nation". In this, he anticipated Jinnah who, a few years down the road, was to evolve the counter-concept of a "Muslim nation", leading Savarkar in 1943 to say that he agreed with Jinnah that there were two nations in India: the Hindu nation and the Muslim nation. The Hindu nation, said Savarkar, comprised all those who regarded India as both their "fatherland" (pitrubhumi) as well as their "holy land" (punyabhumi). This obviously excluded Muslims and Christians whose religion "drew on cultural sources outside the country". This, he maintained, "created divided loyalties". After meeting Savarkar in Ratnagiri in 1925, Hedgewar went on to form the RSS. The "ideological fountainhead" of the BJP, therefore, rests on the two-nation theory. Much has changed in the close to a century between 1925 and now, but it was none other than Subramaniam Swamy who let the cat out of the bag when he said in Hyderabad on 13 March 1993 that the RSS "is not a pro-Hindu organization, it is a purely anti-Muslim organization". (Cited in Facts of Ayodhya Episode by Mohd Abdul Rahim Quraishi from a tape-recorded speech published in the Anti-Corruption Weekly of Hyderabad and later as a booklet, p 155)
The RSS decided from its earliest beginnings that it would not itself be a political actor. That it left to its brother-in-arms, the Hindu Mahasabha, whose Presidentship fell on Savarkar soon after the Congress government of Bombay lifted the British-imposed ban on his political activities in 1937. Till its demise, the Hindu Mahasabha remained a fringe player in Indian politics. And the political space in the Freedom Movement was so filled by the Congress that Golwalkar recognized that the RSS would remain in the margins were it to undertake an overt political role. Moreover, when the Second World War broke out, the RSS were terrified that their activities might be curtailed by the British if they were perceived as playing politics. So Golwalkar took a very deliberate decision to entirely remove his organization from the political sphere, especially after the British came down heavily on all those involved, even tangentially, with the Quit India Movement.
Golwalkar took the line "not to anger the government in any way which might lead to impose a ban" and, therefore "to scrupulously avoid any political activity" (these quotes are from the leading American historian of the RSS, Walter Andersen, whom Ram Madhav quotes approvingly in his Indian Express article). Golwalkar admonished his cadres "to keep our work within the bounds of law, as every law-abiding institution should". The Bombay Home Department hailed these "patriotic" activities of the RSS, commending the RSS for having "scrupulously kept itself within the law and, in particular, refrained from taking any part in the disturbances that broke out in August 1942". Thus, keeping the Brits happy was the RSS's principal contribution to "nationalism" in the crucial years leading to Independence. No wonder, they hate the Congress with such a passion.
The RSS have always maintained that they are "above politics", but politics is so interwoven into their programme that an essential feature of every shakha is the "political class" (Baudhik). It is from these political classes that have emerged the cadres that place themselves at the disposal of the political party to which the RSS is affiliated, and without whom no Sangh Parivar-related party could possibly contend for power. Syama Prasad Mookerjee, "a partyless leader in search of a leaderless party" as another American historian of the RSS, Craig Baxter, has put it, well-recognized this when he set up the Jana Sangh with RSS backing in 1951 in response to the sense of political isolation that overwhelmed the RSS when it was banned for about 18 months following the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, and none came to its rescue. Without the RSS cadres, the Jana Sangh would have floundered. And remember, all these cadres are bound by Hedgewar's 1933 diktat: "It is most essential for a Swayamsevak to obey the orders of the Sarsangachalak at any stage, under any circumstances and without any hitch." Hence, the concern over the BJP's relationship with the RSS.
Ram Madhav argues that "the PM and ministers meet members of social, cultural and business organizations almost as a daily routine" and asks, "Then why an objection in this case?" Because, Mr. General Secretary, the Jana Sangh/BJP was not set up by any of these "social, cultural or business organizations"; because their employees do not turn out in lakhs to canvass votes for the party at election time; because they petition the government, not determine the government's ideological conformity with what the RSS decrees as the right and moral course. Ram Madhav gives the game away when he ends his article by saying that "the ideological family went home content with the general direction of the country under the new government." Well, naturally, if the BJP is doing the RSS's bidding, why would the parivar not go away content?(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Many learned British people had predicted after partition that India would slowly disintegrate due to its conflicting castes,languages and religions. But Nehru with his liberal and Democratic policies,not only United India but also made it into a strong country. The RSS is everything against what Nehru stood for,its ideology is toxic. Unfortunately if RSS has its way the British would have the last laugh.

The sadhus, sadhvis, babas, bapus, maharajs, sants, swamis, gurus, rishis etc., who are BJP MPs in Parliament  sleep in Parliament during session, watch inappropriate videos and ride in BMWs or Audi Q7s at the cost of the common man tax payer.

                            The article is a good short fact-based analysis on the broad RSS/BJP thinking since the birth of RSS. @Abhishek Anand raised the issue of the unsubstantiated imprisonment of Netaji in Russia. But what should we make out of Netaji's and RSS' love (duly substantiated)for Hitler, the most notorious perpetrator of the crimes against humanity in modern times. Maybe now ISIS is competing to outdo Hitler.

He is a learned man &amp; rather than dispelling the misconceptions of the masses he fuels them ....at times he hits below the belt &amp; is criticized by the learned folks(read journalists) of the sub-continent.

                            Dear Aiyer and his ancient historical allusions! Also makes no sense as usual. Be up to date man. Hear what your idol Rahul Gandhi had to say in UP yesterday. He talked of Steve Jobs and the rejuvenation of Apple as a yardstick to rebuild the collapsed Congress in UP! Since his audience of congresswallahs did not know either Jobs or Apple, it predictably made no sense to them. Markandey Katju tweeted that it confirmed his view that Rahul was a duffer. Do you disagree? The moot question is, who is the bigger moron, Rahul Baba or Aiyer Nana? You be the judge.

                            Thanks M.S.A. for exposing the ugly designs of anti-nationals and British agents R.S.S. and co. It is amply clear R.S.S. and co. consists of selfservient selfish people govern by ulterior motives to serve select few at the cost of nation's degeneration. It is in this light the allegation that anti-sikh riots were aided, abetted and engineered byR.S.S. family to avenge the massacres of Hindus in erstwhile terror infested Punjab, appears true. You cannot recall a single instance where Savamsevak served as a savior  in 1984 anti-sikh riot(Hindu-Sikh riot).Most recent anti-national act came into light when it was revealed that Atal Behari Vajpayee did Pokhran 2 nuclear test only to make way for Pakistan to get nuclear armed terrorist state.(otherwise Pakistan was about to sign nonproliferation treaty at the insistence of America ).R.S.S.&amp;Co. are utter disgrace to the nation and are bent upon to take country backward to age of slavery.

                            Mr Aiyer, No doubt that RSS philosopphy is based on extremism and dislike/non inclusivess towards Non hindus and therefore it is urgent and important that if your party really wants to see a plural and just society they stop lip service and show some solid work on the ground.  Your party did not bother to take up this issue seriously inside or outside the parliament.  It is a fact that RSS did not even supported the constitution of India as they felt it is not inspired by the Hindu system and only after court took a written guarantee the ban was lifted.<br/>
Historically Congress and other parties have only used this for a political ploy and if you guys would have been serious enough such forces would not have taken shape.

                            Congress was a party founded by A O Hume,a Scottish foreigner to safeguard the interests of British rulers through their bureaucracy and western educated Indians who were instrumental <br/>
sowing the seeds of discord to perpetuate the regime.<br/>
 The entire Indian population, barring few renegades and communists were part of the national movement.The  Congress claiming <br/>
 the entire credit is the great bluff played on mostly illiterate,impoverished and ignorant population of India. A made-up  history of India was foisted on the nation by leftist propaganda  and congress ideology .A TRUE history of INDIA is waiting to emerge. <br/>
 Indira Gandhi  gave Anand Bhawan to the nation so that all expenditure on its maintenance <br/>
was borne by the Govt. Barring Nehru family members,no other member of public has ever stayed on its premises thereafter.<br/>
 This was the show of sacrifice in the genre of her daughter-in-law Sonia Gandhi  who made the so-called sacrifice to forego  the chance of becoming Prime Minister.Media forgot to mention<br/>
that Indian defence chiefs had conveyed to the President APJ  Abdul Kalam that it will be <br/>
a strategic blunder to give the reins to a foreigner who has not yet surrendered her composite <br/>
passport for the nationality of Italy, Switzerland and Vatican.<br/>
 Please read the article of Mark Tully (under pseudonym) and represntation of Subramaniam Swamy<br/>
in this regard.<br/>
 Mr. Mani Shanker Aiyer has a very acerbic tongue unbecoming of one who had served in foreign service.It may be interesting to recall,when he was Consul at Karachi, his sycophantic admiration for Prime Minister Sri Atal Behari Vajpayee.<br/>
  The Congress party,it seems founded as it was by a foreigner,is waiting to be liquidated by another foreigner. <br/>
 As regards English electronic media ,objectivity is not their forte for a large section of them.

                            Will congress supporter explain what took Congress to realize only in 1942 (57 years after its foundation) to do a "Quit India" movement and not earlier ? What took such nationalistic people to realise that India needed a full independence only in 1930 (45 years after its foundation) Purna Swaraj and not believe in it till that date be happy serving a politicians of great repute sharing lunches and dinners with colonial rulers? To lecture someone selectively on History while painting every thing with one brush of Gandhi family loyalty is understandable but when one tries to argue on logical facts, the real facts remains that Congress never seriously fought for independence rather begged at each step as tactful politicians, what they accuse VD Savarkar or other RSS founders of. If Congress was ever such a threat for British Raj, any person with common sense and neutral brain will understand that its fate would have been that of an Azad, Bhagat Singh, or Bose. Yes congress colonial slave mided people who disguise themselves as elites will bark on why "Bose" files not being released by current BJP government, as if they did it for last 60 years the same. The simple rply to such lop sided irrationals are that in politics, its all about timing. Hence wait and watch when comes the final blow on so called greatness of family patiently, as its perrogative of now BJP to play with this power at right time to right effect for a Congress mukt bharat. And please don't preach your sermons of secularism, for most rational Indians see through it hypocrisy.

Had Gandhi agreed to rid India of all muslims at the time of partition, we wouldn't be seeing so much terrorism in India fueled by ISI and backed by Indian muslims from Kashmir to Rameshwaram..

                            Mani must be right abt RSS b'cos he quoted a lot of foreign authors. By the way Mani, why don't you unleash a bit of your scholarship to enlighten us about the 'patriotic' and 'nationalistic' contributions of your party empress and the clown prince , she is trying to foist on us. Your expert opinion will be also appreciated , if you can educate us about the number of people butchered by RSS like your party goons did in Delhi in the 80s.

                            Mr Mani, this is what is required/expected from you instead of the usual Modi bashing. Very well written. I have a feeling that RSS must call itself just a political organization and leave the so called cultural aspects to people of India. RSS has a right to exist just like other non-hindu political organization, as long as they come under the ambit of law. We hindus should keep a close watch on our organizations and protest if they go off track. We do not want a Hindu pakistan as Indians (across religions) culturally inhibit lot of Hinduness and that need not be emphasized by RSS again and again.

                            At recent 'Secularism Dig' by PM in Ireland, fully indicates that he must be the main accused of Godhra-2002. This ill-mannered, ill-brought up body language is all about real facts of RSS prachark's who can only raise hatred and poison in society.  NRI's in US and people should refuse these RSS sponsored foreign visit to foreign countries in which PM is defaming their own people living in India and only doing his own Prachar with some coating of government's business deals just like they add development after winning elections after polarizing the society.

                            People like Mani are child of slavery under foreign rule and with them will India get fresh start. It is impossible to change these people and what is the point as they are old age now. India has got independence not to be chained to slavery and accept domination of foreigners. Hence India must adopt its own destiny base don its existence and perseverance. Much of world believes and majority indians know this. It is matter of time when young india build their future as free people and enslaved ones!

                            To all those applauding mani. How does a Hindu state make you feel inferior. Reforms is a continuous process in the Hindu society. We should stilly condemn casteist and religious politics that will in some ruin our motherland. Then it's ISIS time.  I request mani as an Indian to work sincerely and try to eradicate the ugly caste system that is a necessary evil. I am no member of follower of the rss, I know a few well to do professionals who work for the Sangh, very nice guys. Mani should stay at the Sangh headquarters for. A week and then decide for himself.

                            Mr Aiyar before you point fingers at others look at your own party. Your party has not been able to uplift the masses for last 60 years in terms of nutrition, education and healthcare and other basic necessities of life. You have successfully retained the entire mass at Maslow's lowest level of hierarchy. This was to your own benefit so that you could continue to rule illiterates.

                            When Mr. Aiyar exhorts the virtues of the pre-independence era Congress, he conveniently forgets that that very Congress was destroyed by Indira Gandhi who separated from Congress Party and setup her own party called Congress(I). Congress(I) was as different from the original Congress as "abc" from "xyz". Indira conveniently chose the name Congress(I) to mislead the people into believing that her's was the original Congress party.   In fact, her Congress(I) had nothing in common principally, ideologically or heriditarily with the original Congress. Her Congress(I) was setup on the ideology of sycophancy, opportunism and unquestionable loyalty to her family. The current Congress is an off-shoot of the Congress(I) and not the original independence movement Mahatma Gandhi's Congress. When Mr. Aiyar sings praises of the Congress, he misleads people into believing that the current Congress party owes its genesis to Mahatma Gandhi's congress; which is totally misleading. Just by having a common name "Congress" does not make the two parties the same. They are as different as chalk and cheese. Indira destroyed every democratic institutions in this country. Remember her.... dismissing elected State governments at her whim and even imposing emergency in this country. Mr. Aiyar should stop referring to the original Congress as their very own. We all know what the current Congress, excuse me, the child of Congress(I), represents and stands for.

                            No doubt this article is an eye opener. Mr Ayer has clearly showcased malafide intention of the family, which ruled (and not Governed) this nation for last 65 years, to let the communalism grow in each sphere of life so that they can remain in power. Immediately after partition, what was really needed was that an education system which will eradicate the social anomalies, eliminate communal sensitivity from the population and encourage secularism. Unfortunately the word secularism, again comes with lots of riders, like social reform, equal education for all, equal distribution of national wealth and bring forward the backwards in the national mainstream. The idea of secularism is to maneuver the moral conduct of the fragmented population of a multi religious, multicultural and multi linguistic country and convert the same into human resource, to secure cooperation for the nation building programme. This process of maneuvering the moral conduct or bring about a change in the thinking process, does not drop from heaven. It requires education, a proper education that not only enlightens a human being but also eradicates the communal feelings and brings about a sense of equality. Congress never propounded any such education policy and as a result of which now we are intolerant, we have religious fanatics, bride burning, disproportionate male female ratio, female infanticide, morality erosion, casteism, riots and the list is endless. Mr Iyer correctly pointed out the existence of another force called RSS in the society. But my question is that if RSS and its equivalents in all the other communities are not desirable then how come these organisations are growing in all shapes and size along with a seizable number of population listening to them? This means that over the period of time the feelings of communal hatred has overcome the hearts and minds of the general population instead of being deterred by the impact of a strong education and information system framed and administered by the Congress. The net result of Congress propounded education is these Swamis,Swadhis and mullahs who are making derogating speeches against each others community every day relentlessly. This system of education was deliberately framed and administered purposively with an aim to communalise the minds and hearts of the population. This type of education is totally unfit for a multi religious country. And the result?. A small example. The matrimonial column of any national daily. In fact Communalism and poverty were the basic ingredient of mistry behind Congress remaining in power past 65 years.

                            Yes RSS aupported a two nation theory, and luckily so otherwise if we had to deal with Pakistan as one of our states it would have been a nightmare... Tje fact is that India gave up Pakistan so that we could have a peaceful nation where co-existence would have been a possibility unlike our neibhours, however the incompetence of the "Family" has stalled progress of our nation.
