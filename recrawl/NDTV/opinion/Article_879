Headline::::Celebrate, Not Mock the Dissenting Writers



DateTime::::2015-10-18T04:04:00+05:30




                                The young Erin Morgenstern, an American multimedia artist and the author of the successful fantasy novel 'The Night Circus' wrote something which caught my attention: "There is a movement happening, a quiet one, a low-profile, low-resolution revolution. Comprised of writers and dreamers, of guerrilla artists and thought-ninjas. Those with something to say. They communicate through text inscribed on true public spaces, rather than blogs and forums. Choosing fewer words, even without being bound by 140 character limits. Using ink instead of pixels. Sending messages in living, breathing space. Pens scream louder into the void. Even if permanent ink is not aptly named."
 
I re-read it yesterday and could not miss the uncanny reference to the situation in my country. MM Kalburgi, the rationalist writer and intellectual, was killed by those who were opposed to his views on radicalism. A Sahitya Akademi winner Kalburgi's death did not elicit a protest by the Sahitya Akademi, leave alone those who were responsible for good governance in the country. Good governance, which means to not just protect the rights of every citizen, but also those writers who speak for them. Kalburgi's death was preceded by the killings of Dabholkar and Pansare, both rationalist thinkers, activists and writers. Let us assume for the sake of argument that the Sahitya Akademi does not bear any responsibility for condemning the death of these two writers. But Kalburgi, was he not one of their own? Does the murder of a member of the Sahitya family not deserve our mourning and demand for tolerance and accountability? Homen Borgohain, Assamese journalist and writer; Nayantara Sehgal who stood against the tyranny of the Emergency during the Emergency; Keki N. Daruwalla; Ganesh Devy; Sarah Joseph, the feminist who fought for the oppressed; Ghulam Nabi Khayal; Uday Prakash who exposed social injustice through his writing like none other; Mandrakanta Sen; Kum Veerabhadrappa, Kannada writer, whose fiction is soaked with the idea of social reform; writer Shashi Deshpande, who resigned from the Akademi's general council last week, called the PM's statement on the Dadri killing "wishywashy" and "evasive".
 
As many as 42 writers in the last two weeks have returned their awards in protest, one of the last being seventeen-year-old Ria Vithasha, who has authored five novels - the killing of senior Kannada writer MM Kalburgi distressed her enough to take the decision to return her Karnataka Sahitya Akademi Award. In an interview to a newspaper, she was quoted as saying, "I knew Kalburgi from childhood and have read all his books. I cried a lot when he was killed and wanted to return my award but my parents told me to have patience and wait. Now so much time has elapsed and still there is nothing being done so like the other writers have done, I have returned my award"
 
Yesterday noted author Amitav Ghosh whose novels have been responsible for bringing Indian literature on the international map "appreciated the courage" of writers who had returned their Sahitya Akademi awards. However, he would not return his own as that would "amount to a repudiation of the institution's history". He also said the government was "tacitly enabling attacks (on writers)" and accused the Akademi of "dereliction of duty".
 
India is a vibrant democracy where its writers like Kaifi Azmi, Gopi Chand Narang, Sardar Jafri, Khushwant Singh, Manto have used their pen to lay out to the common man where the country stood. Post the Babri Masjid destruction and the riots that ensued across the country - a communal blot on the history of India - Kaifi Azmi, who was distressed, wrote a poem called "doosra banwaas" in which he imagines Lord Ram watching his devotees wreck havoc in the name of religion and returned back to his second banwaas. We as a country have taken immense pride for our writers who wrote the iconic 'Tamas' and showed a mirror to the country.
 
But today these writers who are accused of being selective in their protest are being mocked not just by the government but by some of their own colleagues who unfortunately are yet to use their pen for an awakening. The pen, they said, brought down democracies and the tyranny of rulers, and the same BJP which hailed them for their writings against the Emergency has made a mockery of the power of the pen, the sentiment of the common man. Sample the comments of three of the most important voices of the government wherein they not just attribute motives to the resignations, but call the protest against the murder and the increasing intolerance politically motivated:
 
"Its intellectual intolerance that society needs to guard against" - Jitendra Singh, MoS PMO on writers returning awards
 
"After the new Government was sworn in May, 2014, those who had enjoyed the patronage under the earlier establishment, have obviously been uncomfortable with the present Government. This discomfort has been furthered by another political reality in India. With shrinking fortunes, the Congress is showing no signs of revival. The Left is being increasingly pushed to the margin. The new strategy of anti-Modi, anti-BJP sections appears to be to resort to 'politics by other means'. The easiest way is to manufacture a crisis and subsequently manufacture a paper rebellion against the Government in the wake of a manufactured crisis": Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
 
"If they say they are unable to write, let them first stop writing. We will then see. This is an award given by writers to writers. It has nothing to do with the government. It is their personal choice to return it... we accept it": Mahesh Sharma, Culture Minister.
 
I am amused and distraught that this government sees absolutely nothing wrong in a political party which is an ally of the BJP smearing black paint on the face of Sudheendra Kulkarni when all he wanted was to release a book by former Pakistan minister Khurshid Ahmed Kasuri: Kulkarni felt  the book launch in Mumbai would give a momentum to India-Pakistan dialogue.
 
I am not even trying to venture into the controversy over the beef ban, the Dadri lynching and the polarizing statement by the PM's handpicked Chief Minister for Haryana, Manohar Lal Khattar, who said "Muslims can live in this country, but will have to give up eating beef." Similar statements have been given by various members of this government in the past one year and it has now come to be a new 'normal'.
 
But if the Sahitya Akademi and the present day rulers could just look at the isolated case of the murder of Kalaburgi and the plan to attack journalist Nikhil Wagle by the Sanatan Sanstha, does all the protest amount to just a fad?
 
Punjabi writer Dalip Kaur Tiwana in her note of protest wrote: "In this land of Buddha and Guru Nanak, the atrocities committed on the Sikhs in 1984 and on the Muslims recurrently are an utter disgrace to our state and society." Author Krishna Sobti, 90 who returned her award, said "We do not want any more Dadris or Babris."
 
Do those who call it fashionable to return the award as a part of a conspiracy and to get two minutes of fame realise the effect it is causing to the fabric of India when students and youth are being encouraged to believe that the writers that they have read and through whose writings they have witnessed history are rogue elements? Do we realise that by mocking our literature and the literatuters  who are pleading to save the country, we are undoing everything that this country has achieved pre and post independence?
 
I, as a citizen of this country, am pleased that despite the intolerance, there is a resistance, a dissent that ought to be celebrated for the conscience of the common Indian is not dead yet. Dear writers, yes, you will be mocked, criticized, but history shall be objective and searingly honest;  yes, you are fighting an unpopular battle but history and the generations to come shall absolve you. We as your fellow countrymen are proud of our dissenters. Let the flame of justice and tolerance burn bright enough for those who have developed blinkers and will soon wake up to the free hand given to intolerance.(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer.

                            "We as your fellow countrymen are proud of our dissenters".....finally a great article that gives an insight into importance of poets and writes  in a society. The Modi government is acting like a dictator &amp; is not ready to accept that they have gone wrong. Mere acknowledgement of the issue is what the citizen of the nation is looking for, at least do that.

                            "We the writers"? C'mon ayyub, you are no writer. However, you must be expecting an award which is not happening; now that congress is no longer in position to dole out patronage. Why no answer to selective outrage question.<br/>
Stop hating our pm and start thinking positively about working for the country.

                            I like reading Rana Ayub and also listen her bold opinion on  NDTV,she is absolutely right to say that freedom of speech and expression is in danger.In fact people have lost sensitivity in general and it has been very uncontrollable for any party ruled government to handle situation even with all Law and force in hand.We have been very dishonest, mean and senseless to our society.We all have learned nothing from the history and religions.No government can change this,it is not possible to give security to each and every person 24x7,no body is safe,time to awake the inner souls of people otherwise ruin is near,politicians and media also played very negative roll for their benefits.

                            Where were these hypocrite intellectuals when Kashmiri Pandits were driven out from their lands in Kashmir, where were they when thousands of Hindus are still harrassed everyday in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Arab countires, where were they when Tasrima Nasreen were served Jihadi Fatawa to write against Islamic fanatics, where were these intellectuals absonding when Jihadis bombed Temples and Market places to teach a lesson to the non Muslims in India? These are a bunch of doble standard hypocrites pumped by the Congress party and Communists!!

                            Ms. Ayyub, <br/>
I do appreciate your opinion. But one should not forget the reason of wide spread intolerance in the country. This is because of the open appeasement of the political parties to minorities (better read Muslims) over decades ignoring the voice and needs of the majority in the name of vote banks. The parties like congress and Samajbadi do nothing more than appeasing the minority in the name of vote bank. Come to Assam, see if you are a Bangladeshi Muslim you get all the benefits of government, but the son of the soils tribal peoples are methodically evicted from their own lands. They are deprived even from the basic benefits given to a citizens. Ms. Ayyub, I have seem myself in my 4 plus of decade of life how the Bangladeshi villages are mushrooming and even sometimes suddenly evolved overnight. In the name of environment protection, you evict the tribal but welcome the Bangladeshi in places like Kaziranga National Park. This is all done by the very part who calls itself as 'secular'. I will not be surprised if, Assam become another burning spot of such intolerance. Do not blame only the 'right wing'. They were created by the so called 'secular'. India really lost the opportunity to become a truly secular country under Congress regime. It just stopped with slogans alone. Now the intellectual must think positively how to bring the country to the age of Kabir, Shankardev and Nanak. Opposition alone will not help. Yes I condemn the recent incidents and the comments from the motor mouth of BJP, but who to blame?<br/>

What you care about is that they live by YOUR way. Else you can't digest it. That is why you love Sonia, Kejri, Laloo and friends. "Chor chor mausere bhai!"

                            Is this "silent revolution" against the non-secular Indians? Even against Modi? I think not. It is because the taps of privileges have been turned off. <br/>
If you try to throw out illegal occupiers of state privileges (3 year residential help to "artists" turned to 3 decades), the illegal occupiers will suddenly remember their Rent-A-Cause conscience.

                            We can celebrate these writers had they returned their awards when Salman Rushdie was stopped from returning to India for Jaipur Lit fest or when Taslima Nasreen was beaten in India. When these writers have suddenly found a conscience now, that raises valid suspicion and their ulterior motive is evident.

                            Dissenting writers?  They are dissenting for what?  Their losing relevance in times where general public is embracing technology for more information?  Their losing relevance because no one reads what they write?  Their losing relevance because country is no longer ruled by the party that gave them, probably undeserved, awards?  Their losing relevance because they are no longer considered intellectuals as people have realized that writing a good novel doesn't mean they have common sense?  Come to your senses.  You probably won't because you and your likes have only one agenda.  Where were these so called writers when Kashmiri Pandits were being slaughtered?  Why is Hindu life less important to your likes than non-Hindu life, you pseudo-secularist?  It is precisely because of you and your likes that more and more moderate Hindus are moving towards extreme views.  Keep up the good work.  India needs more of you.

The nation has moved on , pl keep these ideas and thoughts to your self. I am not a Bhakt and I am not a fan of BJP. You so called intellectuals are doing what Rahul, Sonia and Scams did to BJP to catapult them into a majority govt. your hardline is polarizing even some of the neutrals like me.

                            Why didn't these writers protest when country witnessed biggest scams, riots, daily violence on women, law and order issues, border issues,..to name few. One writer was so confused that he stated that he wanted to return award due to telangana farmers suicide which makes me think why he was silent during telangana formation struggle wherein state witnessed violence almost on daily basis and several people also died. Sahitya academy is a autonomous body and by making it responsible for state or for that matter central government performance why are they disrespecting the academy.

                            I am an atheist and a Hindu. I am really worried that this freedom of being both may be lost. The only religion which lets you choose theism or atheism is fast losing its flexibility. So far as the protest remains focused on Mr. Kalburgi's murder, being an atheist and a writer, I am with them.<br/>
State governments must be held tightly responsible for law and order - and even ministers of home affairs should be sacked.<br/>
HOWEVER, with AAP leaders and Nehru nieces leading the charge, I doubt the sincerity of the protest.

                            Dear Rana,<br/><br/>
Let me begin by condemning in strong words about what happened with Kalburgi &amp; Ashfaque. These were very unfortunate incidents but more unfortunate is the politics being played by Political parties, media and now even writers.<br/>
This is a shameful but a well known fact that such incidents have been happening in India in past and this isn't any "special" case. 1984 riots were engineered by Congress leadership and its perpetrators were hailed by Congress leadership. The Singh Inquiry Commission has clearly upheld the very known fact that Bhagalpur riots were engineered by Congress leadership. You can very well google and find out comments not only from so called "Sanghis" like Togadia and Adityanath but also from others such as Azam Khan and Owaisi. <br/>
Though there were few murmurs, However, never before we saw such "joint efforts" from Literature community taking on government. <br/><br/>
The massacre of Kashmiri Pandits have killed numerable and have displaced about 150000 of them. This is probably biggest blot on Independent India. 2014, Govt of India (Under Congress) was widely criticized of the way it handled Assam Riots and so much so was dissent of the common public that they were ready to take arms against the army.<br/>
Though there were few murmurs, However, never before we saw such "joint efforts" from Literature community taking on government. <br/><br/>
Now coming to Literature. Taslima Nasrin, an acclaimed writer was not allowed to publish her book, was kept in house arrest and then asked to leave the country. Her only fault, she wrote against fundamentalist (Muslims).  MF Hussain works were attacked by Bajrang Dal &amp; Shiv Sena but he didn't get the support of "Literature Community" from them. His work in movie Meenaxi was banned by Muslim Fanatics and he was forced to withdraw his movie from theaters.  <br/><br/>
Hence, there is a point when few of us think if these writers are making a mountain of a mole and if they actions are biased. <br/><br/>
As said earlier, I strongly object to incidents what have happened and I would really like to see Indians rising above these religion, caste etc to discuss real issues. Just because I am not ready to be anti-hindu doesn't make me a fundamentalist / extremist and vice versa.<br/>
Most important, I think biggest problem in India are these 24 x7 running news channels who manufacture "sensational news" and "create opinion" rather than simply passing us the facts.

                            Dissent is expressed by reasoning and not calling PM as fascist. If dissenting writers have political affiliations, their voice becomes full of politics. If these writers publicly display hatred towards Hindu activists, how they expect to listened by very same people. If Ms Rana believes that the protesting writers have no political agenda, this is because she is herself part of sicular gang.

These writers kept on accepting these awards from the erstwhile Congress regimes who were directly responsible for the massacre of innocent Sikhs and Kashmiri Pandits. Today hypocrisy is the norm of so called intellectuals with the media also being very selective with the news.

                            @RanaAyyub: "by some of their own colleagues who unfortunately are yet to use their pen for an awakening" clearly explains your selective thinking. Do you mean that the people who have not returned their awards did not contribute enough to question the timing and integrity of their colleagues who did return their awards when Muzzafarabad or Assam riots happened? <br/><br/>
I think you people are suffering from "Modi Phobia". If you care to look at the history of these pseudo intellectuals, most of them were against Modi becoming the PM. They have a single point agenda to only go against the PM.

                            Rana Ayub in her desperate hatred for Modi quotes one writer talking about genocide of 1984 on the Sikhs in Delhi. That writer just woke up from his sleep? Or are the writers &amp; intellectuals thinking that 1984 genocide was also done by Modi? This in itself shows the hypocrisy of the writers in returning the awards. I would be happy if one writer returns the awards protesting against the killing of many RSS workers in Kerala or BJP workers in WB or the murder of Poojary by Muslim mobs. But they will not because all such news are blocked out by media. <br/><br/>
We are not against the right to protest but the hypocrisy in the right to protest, the hypocrisy in secularism. The day intellectuals speak for everyone I will support these people. Like Taslima Nasreen (She is a write and for whom none of these brilliant writers stood up when she was physically assaulted in Secular WB) said In India to be secular means to be pro-muslim &amp; anti-hindu.<br/><br/>
If Modi, BJP &amp; RSS have to do more because the perception is that they are anti-muslim then these intellectuals, seculars and writers also have to do more because the perception is that they are anti-hindu and until they don't shed their hypocrisy you will see a lot of Hindu's consolidating behind the Sangh parivar without them having to do anything to get their support!

                            The most absurd reason given by writers for their revolt is the murder of Mohammed Akhlaq in Dadri. On my desk as I write this is a list of massacres in India, that is easily available on the Internet so I am not going to give you the number of people (mostly Muslim) killed, but here is a chronological shortlist of places. Turkman Gate, Marichjhapi, Moradabad, Mandai, Nellie, Delhi, Malliana, Hashimpura, Bhagalpur, Gawakadal, Bombay, Bijbehara, Sopore, Godhra, Naroda Patiya. These communal events occurred in ‘secular' times. Most writers who have joined this revolt were old enough to know what was happening. Why did none of them think of returning their awards?<br/><br/>
Let me answer my own question. They were not disturbed by these past massacres and riots because Narendra Modi was not prime minister. Simple. They did participate though in spreading the untruth that the violence in Gujarat in 2002 was the worst since 1947. In Gujarat itself, there have been worse riots and the massacres of Sikhs in Delhi in 1984 were much, much worse. Nayantara Sahgal accepted her award from the Sahitya Akademi two years later and did not return it in 1987, when policemen in Uttar Pradesh gunned down more than seventy Muslims in a closed truck. Nor did she think of returning it two years later when more than a thousand Muslims were killed in Bhagalpur.

                            Coz of of having been or being a jurno, people like Ms. Ayub can insist that writers, jurnos and activists are always right and any act of difference, would be defined "intolerant". Look at another award winning!!! author Ms. Sobti saying "do't want anymore Dadris or Babris". Where does Dadri &amp; Babri equate?? Dadri can be even out of feud BTW few families. Same statement was made by Azam Khan. Statement of Azam Khan, is clear  "Instigation", for another massacre of few hundred people in Mumbai or other locations of our country.  Then, what the writer expects to interpret statement of Ms. Sabti ?? Any way at 90 nothing sensible can be expected. All these writers, Authors and interlocutors, did nothing when 4000 sikhs were massacred in  Delhi for  1 life  AND when Congress  led  UPA govt, aided to  murder 100s and 1000s of Tamils in Srilanka, children &amp; women included AND during Muzzafur nagar riots in UP. Probably, only NOW and when a "nationalist" have taken the governance to retrieve glory of this great country, these scholars and intellectuals, decided to do something, for future generations to "Absolve". What all these people did or doing, when J&amp;K, formerly a Hindu Kingdom ( Hari Sing Dynasty) , has been / are being converted to IS ( Islamic State) by left outs of Mogul invaders and people having Arabi/ Mogul Genes. If these intellectuals have NO objection, for an Islamic state with in Indian Union, that too by occupiers, they have NO right even to whisper about Mr. Khattar's statement, even if he decides to make Hariyana a Hindu State and if his decision is NOT acceptable to the people of Hariyana, let them throw out his  Govt. Its not worth talking about Mr. Kulkarni, who had acted as  program agent for a Pakistani murderer, who was part military junta . Its time for all these writers etc, to draw a line , which they need ensure NOT to cross, if they desire to maintain dignity.  Dasara &amp; Diwali festivals are in the corner and Ms. Ayub, indeed can celebrate.

                            Let us make it a practice. Every time, there is a murder or a rape or riot in any part of the country, the writers ( and on many occasions self proclaimed intelligent people) take it upon themselves to protect the interest of the rest people. They have only been writing so far. Now it is going that extra mile. Of course better late than never. I only hope they will be consistent going forward at least. That gives a greater credibility to their actions.

If Mahatma Gandhi were alive this time he sure would have changed his opinion about Kashmir in which he had seen a ray of hope for tolerance  the there.Things have changed since not only in Kasmhir or India or the whole world.Protesting is ok but protest against all bad things.Writers can surely write.

The issue with the award since inception has been the transparency. There was never a transparent valuation for the award. Writers atleast from my state of Kerala, did not even raise a voice or talk against the fishermen killed by the Italian Marine. Do they sympathise only with their community ...

                            If the writers returning awards wish to be treated with respect, they simply can do the following<br/>
Cite instances of Curb on freedom of expression, Cite instances of intolerance, Cite Instances of Violence &amp; prove that it is because of the Present dispensation in power. Also be ready to be counted, when people cite instances of equally bad or worse times in earlier regimes &amp; also during the regime when they accepted awards. Last time on a TV channel when asked why did she not return the award for last 5 years, a "Public Intellectual" said that its her Prerogative how &amp; when to protest. This is running away from inconvenient questions. Just by a rhetoric they can't prove a point.

                            Rana Ayub, please return your award as well. Your writings always had a tinge of partiality towards Congress/Communist.

                            I really appreciate your views &amp; I personally endorse what ever you said . It's really shame that they kill anyone who is against their views . So shameful, their act is more or less like Taliban &amp; ISIS, no difference.

                            It seems their conscience has suddenly drowned upon all these writers that in the first place they never deserved these awards. However, we all know that these writers, since taps of doles has been stopped by the new dispensation, are howling but in not so clear words, about the stoppage of sops to them. And our great secular and independent media is giving them space because they are also affected by the stopping of perks by the new dispensation for which they had become so used to.

                            So the reverse should not be true. Writers dont have to respect or constructively cricitize the PM? Just translate and put blame on an impotent State Govt's failure to PM

                            How easily they have forgotten that there was total press censorship then and that journalists defying it went to jail. How easily they have forgotten that writers and poets shared prison cells with political leaders who opposed Mrs. Gandhi. How easily they have forgotten the communal tensions that spread because Mrs. Gandhi's son took charge of a family planning programme that forcibly sterilized men, young and old, and that Muslim men were specially targeted. How easily they have forgotten that medieval Muslim quarters like Turkman Gate in old Delhi were turned to rubble by bulldozers, and that this caused communal violence because of rumours that senior municipal officials said they would not allow ‘another Pakistan' to exist......

                            It's been repeated many times that this is largely a motivated and political protest by writers and others. Not all of them have such motivations, but the overwhelming majority do. The protest is not based on data. TV anchors have repeatedly tried to discredit this point. But on some shows it has been pointed out that nothing has changed since the Modi government came to power. These sorts of incidents happened before Modi came to power and continue to occur, at roughly the same level of intensity, after Modi came to power.<br/><br/>
This has become clear, so some journalists have taken to arguing that Modi should have made a a statement earlier. I would actually agree that he should have, but I don't think that journalists are making this demand with good intentions. I believe they were waiting to interpret it as an admission of guilt or create a new controversy out of it.<br/><br/>
Whenever asked why they didn't protest at earlier atrocities, the writers and journalists make weak arguments about how they actually did protest back then. It's well known that their protests are out of control for incidents involving even 1 person today, while they made some relatively mild protests on incidents of a massively larger scale earlier. The biggest factor predicting the size of their protest is not the incident they are protesting, but who is in power.

                            Puesdo  Seculars  proved themselves  that they do not deserve the honour and recognition  they have been given  by submitting the. Awards.  You are proving to be more  Communal by. Highlighting  your  so called surrendering  the  Awards.  The nation. has. gone through so much of turmoils before ,  but your conscious  never pricked  you. It is only  in the. Bihar Elections that the morality enshrishned in you woke up. Is it not shame full on your part to  High light your.  Great  Sacrifice at this  particular time ?

                            If writers criticizing is dissent and needs to be cherished, then why is criticizing these writers a taboo? Are they God sent???
