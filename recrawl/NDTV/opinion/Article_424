Headline::::What Amit Shah Is Doing Wrong in Bihar and Bengal



DateTime::::2015-02-21T19:39:00+05:30




                                
	(Siddharth Varadarajan is a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Public Affairs and Critical Theory, Shiv Nadar University)
	Ten months is a long time in Indian politics. After piloting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through a series of political victories at the national and state levels, party president Amit Shah's strategy of growing the BJP through an aggressive combination of open campaigning and hidden intrigue appears to be running aground.
	If the BJP master strategist was handed a humiliating defeat by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi, the return of Nitish Kumar as Chief Minister of Bihar marks the collapse of Shah's plan to split the Janata Dal (United) in the run-up to crucial assembly elections in the state later this year. Instead of going through the motions of a trust vote that he would have lost despite the BJP declaring its intention of voting for him, JD(U) rebel Jitan Ram Manjhi chose to cut his losses and resign gracefully. Shah's hopes are now pinned on the discredited ex-Chief Minister setting up his own party, an effort the BJP is bound to underwrite in an effort to woo Bihar's significant Mahadalit population away from the formidable political combine that Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad and the Congress party represent in the state.
	 
	But whether Manjhi will keep on obliging the BJP is not clear. If he broke with Nitish on the basis of a nudge and a wink from the saffron party, political observers were struck by the conciliatory tone he struck towards the JD(U) at his press conference on Friday. In the topsy-turvy world that is Bihar's politics today, his eventual  'ghar wapsi' to the Lohiaite fold also cannot be ruled out.
	 
	Just as the BJP in Delhi could not resist the onslaught of an opponent in a contest that became essentially bipolar, Amit Shah knows his party is likely to lose the Bihar assembly elections if the enemy camp remains united.
	 
	In 2014, when the Modi wave was at its strongest, the BJP touched a high water mark of 29.4 per cent of the popular vote in Bihar. Its allies - Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party - brought in another 9.4 per cent. All told, it was on the basis of 38.8 per cent of the vote that the National Democratic Alliance won 31 of the state's 40 seats. In contrast, the JD(U), RJD and Congress collectively got nearly 45 per cent of the vote but won just 8 seats because they fought the BJP as a divided opposition.
	 
	Given the weakness of its state leadership, the BJP will find it difficult to match a Nitish-led grand coalition. Of course, the JD(U) will be battling anti-incumbency and the fact that coalition partner votes will not transfer to one another very smoothly because of complex caste equations. If Mahadalits feel slighted by Manjhi's ouster, that will further complicate matters for the JD(U).
	 
	The JD(U) may feel inspired by the AAP's performance in Delhi but Nitish is no Arvind Kejriwal. Nevertheless, the perception that the BJP used dirty tricks to try and split his party and was willing to prolong Manjhi's inept administration for political gains may work as a selling point for the JD(U)-led coalition.
	Apart from the Manjhi card, the BJP also knows it might benefit from religious polarization. Here, the compulsions of Shah's style of 'anything goes' politics will come into clash with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's slogan of 'sabke saath' and create complications for the BJP at the national level.
	If Bihar represents the most immediate challenge to Amit Shah's stewardship of the BJP, West Bengal is one state where the party's prospects, on paper at least, look very promising. The party clocked an impressive vote share of 17 per cent in the Lok Sabha election of 2014, just 6 per cent behind the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The Trinamool Congress (TMC) was way ahead with 39.8 per cent, but the BJP has narrowed the gap in the two by-elections held in the state recently, Bongaon and Krishnaganj. As the Left vote continues to collapse, the BJP's vote share in these seats rose to an impressive 25.4 and 29.5 per cent respectively, up from what it polled in these assembly segments just 10 months ago.
	 
	With the BJP gaining votes from the Left, conventional wisdom suggests the emerging bipolar contest between the Trinamool and the BJP will work to the latter's advantage. But Amit Shah realizes it will take more than the collapse of the Left to overtake the 40 per cent vote share Mamata Banerjee consistently seems to be polling. The Left's decline allows the BJP to pitch for the lion's share of anti-Mamata votes, but it also allows Mamata to ensure the anti-Modi, anti-BJP vote is not split between her Trinamool and the Left.
	 
	Making strategic use of the Central Bureau of Investigation, which is currently probing the Saradha chit fund scam, an effort seems under way to split the TMC. Party leader Mukul Roy is being encouraged to rebel, in much the same way that Manjhi was egged on. Unlike Manjhi, whose organizational skills as a standalone leader may not produce the kind of results the BJP wants, Roy's dissidence could well prove quite costly for the Trinamool. But with state BJP leaders wary of an outsider being parachuted over their heads, the absorption of Roy in the BJP's overall political strategy may not be a very smooth affair.
	 
	Mamata Banerjee's priority for now is to ensure her party convincingly wins the Kolkata Municipal Council and other town elections due to be held around April or May. Taking a leaf from Kejriwal's playbook, she has said there will no longer be any tax on water. She is also trying to woo auto and taxi drivers. If the TMC holds its own in the municipal corporation and other elections, it is quite likely that Mamata may call for assembly elections later this year, perhaps around the time of the Bihar elections, rather than wait till 2016, when the tenure of the current assembly ends.
	Modi and Shah's aggressive strategy in West Bengal, where they have taken Mamata head-on, might well turn out to be counter-productive. The political soil of Bengal, as well as  Assam and Odisha, is fertile for the BJP - provided the party is willing to grow organically. In all these states, the traditional two-party system has broken down. Encouraging defections and leveraging the CBI, as appears to be happening in Odisha and Assam too - where Congress leader Hemanta Biswa Sarma is believed to be knocking on the BJP's doors following his implication in Saradha - may give a short-term boost to the party, but will not help it in the long run.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            It seems there is nothing which is being done correctly by BJP, at least this is the view of Dr. Siddharth Varadarajan, it will be really great to know what he approves of in the party or of the Prime Minister. Sharda scam is being given a colour of political witch hunting, is it not a probe sanctioned and under regular review of the Honurable Supreme Court. Mr. Shah had not asked Mr. Nitish Kumar to annoint Mr. Manji as CM...the people of Bihar, poor and caste ridden they may be, are politically most mature and will show the way.....the coming months will be interesting as the most astute political author has already awarded  two third majority to the Nitish &amp; Lalu combine in the ensuing assembly elections!

                            Sidharth, again you have come with a satire, how shah is breaking the opposition and ruling party, JDU &amp; TMC, while your elegance has absorbed the mismatch of Nitish ji tying up with corrupt RJD supremo LALU ji, and CONGRESs, and how bundles of millions rupees were swindled away by a handful of people , CBI is doing a good job, Supreme Court has refused to oblige the TMC gov. Manjhi may have had his vision, Mukul may have his , ultimately they are ills themselves, but your head is fine with the above reason, you ate happy that millions of poor in Bengal have been robbed of their meager savings, but you find fault in BJP, you have questioned the Supreme Court too, as you have a view that CBI is being used strategically . Get real sir.

                            Mamta has already said She will not cross the limit. She has to understand MODI is Prime Minister of India and not Chief Minister of Gujrat. As for Amit Shah suggest you write your comments in USA as you are no more a citizen of India.

                            Why oh why no mention of the fact that Lalu is a convicted felon out on bail and that no self respecting party should collaborate with that veteran swindler.  Nitish is obviously keen to do so.  Ergo, Nitish is an unprincipled liar and a low down, egotistical politician who thought he was making the right move in distancing himself from Modi, having previously praised him POST GODHRA!  Indians can do without such low life polluting the body politic of India.  One only has to think of the contribution that the State of Bihar and Biharis make to the well being of India.  This amounts to nothing.  Indeed, that state sucks the resources of India and its people migrate to other cities like Delhi.  And yet, that state seems to have a lot of clout when it comes to the overall governance of India.  About time the rest of India gave Bihar a piece of its mind!

                            Since it is the BJP, which is responsible for the mess in Buhar, does Varadrajan also believe that it is the BJP which egged Nitish to install Manjhi in the first place and then somehow make move to unseat Manjhi, just a few months later?<br/><br/>
Much of what has happened in Bihar is Nitish Kumar's doing. He thought the "secular" parties will win resoundingly in the 2014 General Elections and so backstabbed the BJP. What did he expect the BJP or any other party in that position to do- wait and watch? Nitish Kumar has proved himself to be as much an opportunist as the other so-called secular parties that line India;s political firmament- ranging from the Left at one end to the 'socialist' RJDs and the SPs and the TMCs, at the other. Nitish found it convenient to eject Lalu, when he sniffed power and hugged him a few years later, when he misread the tea leaves.<br/><br/>
So, when Varadarajan defends such so-called "secular, socialist"  idiots, one wonders whether political commentators really have anything to say apart from laying bare their biases.

Are these guys who commented below so ignorant in politucs that theu do not agree to the reality of ao many corrupt politicians like Yeduyarappa, Gadkari in BJP. Are they trying to say that CBI is not being used by BJP to target TMC.If tomorrow same Lalu wants to have an alliance with BJap do they think Amit Shah will not be happy. BJP social media cell tried to do the same thing during Delhi elections by writing all personal comments on AAP &amp; Arvind which were rubbished by voters of Delhi and it to is high time that that BJP think thank realize that they cannot win elections by spreading lies but by doing some work on ground &amp; deliver those promises made during look sabha elections. If any body has forgotten the promises let them go thru the lok sabha election speeches of those great BJP leaders Modi, ajaitley etc. It is close to 10 months now &amp; We are still waiting for fulfillment of at least one of those promises Modi bhai. I proudly say I am a supporter of Congress unlike the people below who are hiding their real ifentity:))

                            What confuse me is fluency of these articles. Because I have never seen Mr. Varadrajan speaking fluently on any subject in any debate. It is as if he is (almost) stammering, or at least always struggling to find words, forget sentences. He hardly able to speak, but when he writes he is flawless (always ridiculous though, irrespective of subject he choose). And that's why I seriously doubt that some one else is writing on his behalf. Hope we will know truth some day. ;)

                            Mr Vardhrajan world already know about your hatred for Mr Modi &amp; BJP. You now need to focus your talaent on something new. perhaps you should write a book praising Congess rule in the last 65 year or write book praising Nehru Gandhi Family. You will have enough material available for this venture. Your like minded friends will help you or rather your hate Modi club members will give some inputs. Even a book on Kejriewal is welcome.<br/><br/>
So be informed that NDTV TV is accomodating such thought only because of their closness to Congress party or say anti BJP Policy.<br/><br/>
Just because you have a forum does not mean that you are allowed to satisfy you personal hatred towards a person or organisation.<br/><br/>
You should use your talent to do some positive writing. I think you are wasting your talaent with such "Bakwas" writings.

                            I sincerely hope that the really smart Delhi people have shown India and the world that what works is clean politics that talks about and works towards betterment of the electorate and eradication of corruption. Wish AAP all the best.

                            Bihar elections will be a repeat of the Battle of Buxar,if Modi looses the battle he will end up like Shah Alam or Bahadur Shah.

                            Yeah right. Mr Varadarajan is so concerned about the so called faulty strategy of the BJP. He is a true well wisher of the BJP
