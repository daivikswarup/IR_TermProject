Headline::::Land Acquisition From a State's Perspective



DateTime::::2015-05-21T22:20:00+05:30




                                Will the proposed changes to the 2013 Land Acquisition Law make land acquisition easier and more equitable? In the ongoing debate, this question is mostly being answered from a national perspective. But the debate can become better informed if issues are examined with reference to a concrete state-specific situation.
The Odisha case is particularly interesting because of three reasons. Firstly, states like Odisha, though quite large, do not really capture the imagination of the national media in view of the skewed distribution of political power and media reach (TRPs). Secondly, Odisha has huge natural resources and growth potential, much more than any other state in the country, though continuing to be one of the poorest. Thirdly, no matter what the law is or ultimately becomes, the implementation has to be done at the state level, and a law will be of little consequence if it cannot be implemented.
In 1983, the government of Sri Janaki Ballabh Patnaik, in which I was the Irrigation Minister, proposed a second dam on the Mahanadi River at Manibhadra. Odisha had been ravaged in 1982 by the worst floods till date. The objective was laudable as the River Mahanadi indeed needs a second dam for effective flood control in Odisha's coastal districts and the lone dam at Hirakud was aging.
 
But there were massive protests in Western Odisha and even a fear that the state was getting divided on regional lines. The project had to be shelved. This was the first lesson for us in Odisha that large scale acquisition of land like for the Hirakud Dam will no longer be possible.
The second major project that had to be abandoned was the National Missile Test Range in 54 villages of Baliapal and Bhograi Blocks in Balasore districts. This was in 1986. As a minister in the state government, I was privy to the project. The Union Government had told us that the missile range was vital for India's national security. Scientists had advised that the land chosen was the most suitable in terms of geo-location, and the integrated range could serve the dual purposes of missile and rocket testing for military purposes as well as space exploration. We were also assured that there would be no paucity of funds for rehabilitation and resettlement. Central forces were provided to deal with the agitators. Baliapal became a huge and successful popular movement of the people, the first movement of its kind in independent India.
The villagers erected barricades and did not allow state functionaries to enter the area, and finally the project had to be abandoned. There was little that we could do. The national security argument and the call for patriotism made no headway.
We have seen similar resistance movements in Odisha's Gandhamardan, and more recently, in Niyamgiri. In Kalinga Nagar, where Tata Steel is setting up a 10 million-tonne steel plant, during the process of construction of a compound wall, there was a violent clash between local adivasis and the state police in January 2006.
12 adivasis died in police firing, and one police man was hacked to death. After a decade, the land acquisition for the Tata Steel Plant is still not completed, the commissioning of the plant has been grossly delayed, and the local community has been scarred permanently and is very unhappy with the current resettlement process.
South Korean Company POSCO signed an MOU with Odisha Government in June 2005 for setting up a steel plant. Opposition by people meant huge delays in the land acquisition process; in the meantime, POSCO is no longer sure of getting mining linkage and the future of the project is 'uncertain'. POSCO Steel Plant was to become the largest foreign direct investment in India.
So the last three decades have seen the rise of very strong resistance movements and repeated failure of the state to enforce its power of eminent domain, i.e. the power to acquire land for public purpose. People debating these issues from ivory towers either are unaware of the ground reality or expect the problems to go away. I am unable to join them in their dreams because I have been a grassroots person and have long administrative experience in dealing with these problems.
In all these instances that I have cited the use of the State's power of eminent domain, the might of the state and promises of the best compensation packages could not defeat peoples' resistance. All the tricks of the game were used. Yet, people held out. The Delhi-Mumbai elite need to accept the reality of India.
After seeing the resilience of Odisha's farmers, adivasis and Dalits and working with them for the last four decades I am convinced that any attempt at forcible land acquisition in Odisha for large projects will fail unless people can become partners in the growth process. I cannot say whether it will make land acquisition easier in Gujarat, but it will make no headway in Odisha.
The 2013 Act provides a workable solution and a framework to make development inclusive. Not that the 2013 Act would have made land acquisition easier, or less prone to failure. But at least there was a chance. So make whatever changes to the law you wish by using parliamentary numbers, people will not give up.
This is not a fight between the BJP and the Congress, as some may superficially imagine. The issues are much larger and can cause serious class conflict and violence; at many places, the ultra-left groups will benefit the most. There are many laws in the statute book in India that are not implemented and may be un-implementable. If an attempt is made to acquire land forcibly and without fair compensation by changing the 2013 Act, the new law will also enter the category of un-implementable laws.
Why has land acquisition failed so frequently? In the first three decades after independence, the state could acquire vast tracts of land to set up large industries, dams and irrigation projects. Each time people were displaced, they were promised adequate compensation, a share in the benefits, and a brighter future for themselves and their children. But, in due course people found the growth did not become inclusive, and many were left running from pillar to post to get what they were promised. Some claims are unsettled after 50 years at this writing. People no longer trust the state represented by a politico-bureaucratic combine and deeply resent displacement.
Most people affected by land acquisition happen to be small and marginal farmers, share croppers and landless people. A majority of these people are adivasis, Dalits and people from other socio-economically backward communities because it is mostly under their land that minerals are located. These are the people who live in the hills and forests and face the maximum displacement. In earlier times, they buckled under pressure and clung to the hope of just treatment. But no more. They have no asset other than a small patch of land that they propose to bequeath to the next generation as the only source of livelihood.
Odisha has had no benefit of the green revolution, farming is unsustainable. Because of poor investment in the social sector, people have very little education and employable skills in an industrial economy. They will allow no land acquisition unless they are on board and can see a long-term interest in allowing land acquisition.
So industries planning to acquire land have two options. Either they work with the people using the framework created under the 2013 Act, or crib at the World Economic Forum Meetings in Davos in suit and boot about administrative paralysis and cost of doing business in India.    
The question is whether industries and governments will change their approach to land acquisition. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik promised land to many including POSCO, Mittal, Tatas. He signed MOUs with private companies without taking the consent of the people. People rejected the MOUs, land acquisition failed and projects had to be shelved.
The 2013 Act makes the possibility of land acquisition much more likely and Industry should have accepted the reform as a viable compromise formulae and a possible middle ground, and worked with it for a few years rather than subverting it through a government they have brought to power with generous support.(Niranjan Patnaik is a senior Congress leader and former Cabinet Minister from Odisha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            You nailed it! The industry doesn't believe in let and let live and is Modi, being an industry puppet, is just singing their tune. You should listen to people who I used to think to be decent, like Gurucharan das and Kiran Majumdhar etc.. Now I no longer trust any industry thug, nor will I trust Hindutva thugs like Modi.

                            Good to find some sane advice. The NDA Government unnecessarily got into all these. This is a complex problem and cannot be solved by legislation. Industries have to accept the realities. They have to go to the people, most of them poor and persuade them to part with their land. Industries that succeed to get the consent of the people will be able to acquire land, those who fail to get people on their side will fail. Posco failed in Odisha. Tata Steel made similar errors initially and then worked with the people and the new Tata Steel plant at Kalinga Nagar is finally getting commissioned by end of the year. Consent of the people is vital in a democracy and there are no short cuts available. Hope industries will study Mr Pattnaik's suggestions objectively and create a win-win situation. Sincere and mature advice from a seasoned politician and administrator.

                            The points made initially were clear in defining the difficulty of land acquisition in india. But later in the article while supporting the 2013 form of land acquisition bill the writer doesn't define clearly how will it solve the real problem of acquisition of land for defense and infra projects.

                            MR. Patnaik is smart. He did not describe why 2013 bill is better than the proposed 2014 bill. he did not elaborate on the differences of these two and show reasons as to why 2014 bill will fail and 2013 bill will succeed. <br/><br/>
This is typical of congressmen. Not that they are not intelligent, they lack data and more importantly conviction. one can not attribute his silence on the differences between these two versions of the bill to lack of knowledge because he was very eloquent on the implementation owes, meaning he is aware and knowlegeable. <br/><br/>
Mr Patnaik, could you please write one more article just comparing the two versions of the bill and argue as to why the later version will fail but the former would succeed?

                            Mr. Niranjan Patnaik, will you be able to explain me how a road widening project gets the require land? How is places like Patia become so developed? How can you find land for an Infosys or TCS office? Why there is no opposition while acquiring land for any projects in state capital or eastern part of Odisha? This is only petty politics. Politics at the ground is a big trouble. That is the only thing which is against the development of Odisha. Its very simple for you guys. Odisha is rich in mineral resources. It sells most of the raw materials to other states. But it wont be able to make a plant to use those. Simple thing is politics is creating all the problems. Hence, many odias leave their parents and homes and go to other states for earning their livelihood.

                            This article provides an insight into this complex issue from the perspective of state he represents in almost non-political language.<br/>
It must be appreciated that he has accepted the failures of his own governments in past and explains the lessons learnt.<br/>
He is right when he says that the new law will automatically become un-implementable without the people's consent.<br/>
The poor and the marginal are always the easiest target to push aside and yet use them in every 'bhashan' and 'charcha' and shed tears for their pain.<br/>
The solution lies in the honest efforts by both industrialists and the political class ,not to find the easiest route but a little costly route of engaging with the locals and promising them a respectable future without their land.

                            Mr Patnaik has spoken like a true Khangressi with a decade of economic devastation of India to be proud of. It is Land acquisition alone which can give these small and marginal farmers and chance to improve their life as Industrial workers and various benefits that Labours enjoy compare to the stagnation these farmers have faced for centuries. It is in Congress interest to maintain status quo for these  'backwards' as it suits their political model. What we need now is a radical change of approach break deadlock -where generations of young rural people are becoming lift operators in cities instead of being Industrial Labours-where as their land are lying fallow with little or no economic output. Why do you think we have so many poor farmers committing suicide ? How many Industrial Laborers have you heard of committing suicide ? Congressi politics is always about keeping the mass poor , polarized and confused and getting their votes - but this model is about to break - So Mr Patnaik you can either roll up your dhoti and start doing some real work for his land or at least stay away from his old beaten path of dirty politics.

                            The new law will enable acquisition of land in a meaningful time frame and hence allow effective decisions on Investment instead being stuck in MoU. Mr Patnaik has made a very relevant point that this Law ultimately has to implemented at the State Level (and also will be adopted by each State's assembly with modification). So the States which can make better use of it will have a competitive edge. There is no doubt even among Congress ecomomic advisers that our vast and economically unproductive agri-labours have to be transferred to Industrial labours for their social improvement. If Odisha is not in a position to make effective use of this improved Law then don't blame the law itself - because many other states perhaps will use it to transform their society much faster. Odisha has to find a way of using this Law or keep crying for another century or so that they are poor and neglected.

                            The act of 2013 is only a product of anti-development person's mindset. It shall only lead to numerous litigations, stalling acquisition and depriving farmers of bright and prosperous future. No law can help if foreign aided NGOs are not squarly dealt with. NC Patidar

                            It is good to see a state's perspective on the newly proposed Land Acquisition Bill. However, have you ever questioned why Orissa remains one of the most backward states in the country despite such abundant natural resources? You think that the new law will be "unimplementable". That may be the case in Orissa but why should other states and peoples who want industrialisation suffer? On what basis do you hold back the people of say Maharashtra or Rajasthan or Tamil Nadu? Let the new law be passed and then, if you feel there are gaps, please go ahead and make the changes in your state law for that. Do you even realise that the 2013 Act with its many requirements is a no-go from the start?? It will stay on paper like the UPA's nuclear agreement and FDI in retail.

                            There is now doubt that India is abysmally poor in Industrialisation and  and an 'effective' Land acquisition law along with reformed Labour laws will attract the necessary investment for Industrialisation to happen. If we continue to confuse poor people then States like Odisha has to brace themselves for extreme poverty for a long time to come. Congress style politics has already robbed this Nation of decades of lost opportunity and the power hungry Netas continue to do so from the opposition. They fail realize that BJP has got an overwhelming mandate from the people to drive its Social and Economic agendas.

                            Little surprise that the author, a congress member spent no time on how the 2013 law is successful. It is a total failure, depriving the nation's youth from jobs, sms depriving the country an opportunity to become a manufacturing base. But let's look at the "positive" side: the farmers still have their land with the enormous potential it holds and the 2013 law is protecting them. Meanwhile no one benefits in real terms

                            Mr. Patnaik says that Orissa has a lot of growth potential. But people who oppose land acquisition may not want growth or jobs. They are satisfied with farming and other kinds of livelihoods. So, why bother them with projects that require land or any kind of industrialization for that matter. Rather Mr. Patnaik should tell them that they should really focus on farming and go back to farming if they have mistakenly taken jobs outside forests and farms. If we can do that there will be no demand for land and land acquisition will be a non-issue.

                            Mr Patnaik talked about problems and showed no solution. When real estate can prospor by acquiring so much of prime land, why can not state do that with adequate compensation. The new law proposes 4times more than the prevailing rate. Mr Patnaik's Govt was a big failure. There was no adequate political will to do anything.

                            This is one of the best opinions I have read in a long time. The power of eminent domain has no place in a democratic set up. Yes, the state must acquire private property for public purposes. But never against the will of the original owners. It is the people who have elected the government. To serve them and promote their welfare. Not to cheat them and acquire their property forcibly, even if it were for the larger public good. The only exception I can think of is for defense purposes. From experience we have found that all infrastructure and massive industrial projects carry their own risks such as floods, earthquakes, pollution etc. apart from massive environmental damage. If a tribal or rural community wants to carry on with its own way of life, it is not for any government to impose their ideas of development on them. And past experience of poor rehabilitation makes it compulsory that in future the government should first construct the entire alternative rehabilitation structure and get it accepted by the community about to be displaced, before even embarking on any grandiose development scheme. If you consider Mahatma Gandhi's views on thoughtless industrialisation, importance of villages and community displacements you realise how far ahead were his views on subjects that trouble us today. Time for a rethink, certainly.

                            Why do we need so much new land ? As an example- current allocated land to pathetic state of condition industrial estates In various districts speak for themselves. Highly industrious cities in world  are not blessed with lot of land but skilled labor and huge automation  led productivity. Singapore is smaller than bhubaneswar but comands a industry driven economy of 250 + billion dollar. The right focus should not be on allowing more land but providing better and productive infrastructure
