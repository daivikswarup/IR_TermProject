Headline::::Why Pakistan Won't Burst Crackers if BJP Loses Bihar



DateTime::::2015-10-31T05:19:00+05:30




                                In an election address in Bihar yesterday, the Bharatiya Janata Party's election Chanakya and president expressed concern about crackers in Pakistan. "Even if by mistake," he said, and repeated the caveat, "should the BJP lose Bihar, there will be fireworks in Pakistan. Would you like that?"
By now I don't know what the BJP is seeking votes in Bihar for: for the Ganga of development to flow in the state, to ban cow slaughter which has already been banned here since 1955, to save or disturb affirmative action for the lower castes, or to prevent fireworks in Pakistan.
Let us take his statement at face value for a moment, and not infer it to mean that Muslims in Bihar would happy to see the BJP lose.
Amit Shah's concern over firecrackers in Pakistan not only reveals his anxiety over the numbers that November 8, counting day, will throw up, but also what he thinks the BJP represents in Pakistan. He seems to suggest that Pakistan likes the BJP to be out of power in India. This is not true.
The truth is, many in Pakistan were looking forward to Narendra Modi becoming prime minister. If you glance at media coverage from Pakistan around the 2014 general elections, it was quite positive.
For one, many Pakistanis think the BJP is better placed for an India-Pakistan detente. As a right-wing party, it whips up nationalist paranoia when the Congress tries to do the same. Liberal Pakistanis fondly remember how Atal Bihari Vajpayee was able to push India-Pakistan peace, both before and after Kargil. The Congress' Dr Manmohan Singh didn't even have the support of his own party to pursue peace with Pakistan beyond a point.
Secondly, the trade lobby in Pakistan thought that Narendra Modi, like Nawaz Sharif, was more openly for laissez faire than the Congress was, and would thus be good news for India-Pakistan trade.
These hopes haven't come true, because they were silly in the first place. For liberal Pakistanis to think the Indian right-wing in power is good for crossing the Wagah border is akin to Indians loving General Pervez Musharraf in power.
Thirdly and most importantly, Modi's ascent has been the best news for the Pakistani right-wing. Why just right-wing, even a liberal Pakistani friend told me why he was happy to see Modi take the prime minister's office. "India's secular mask needed to go," he said. "India pretended to be this secular country and Pakistan looked bad in contrast."
It goes further. Pakistan's formative idea is the two-nation theory, the idea that Hindus and Muslims are not just separate communities but separate nations, deserving their own nation states. It's an idea whose polar opposite is Indian secularism, which sees Hindus, Muslims and everyone else co-existing together, with no state discrimination on account of religion.
So why would Pakistan be unhappy to see the rise of the BJP and the discrediting, indeed disavowal, of Indian secularism?
When an Akhlaq is murdered on false beef rumours, Pakistanis feel vindicated. When BJP leaders and ministers justify the incident - it was an accident, cow slaughter hurts sentiments, etc, - it proves for Pakistanis the rationale of the two-nation theory. That without their own country, Pakistanis would have been facing bans on cow meat, and getting lynched even if they were eating mutton.
The RSS-BJP's clear agenda is to make Indian Muslims second class citizens, one election at a time, which is exactly what Jinnah said he feared, except he feared it from the Congress!
The Hindu right likes to provoke neighbouring countries with the idea of a Greater India, Akhand Bharat, but if you sit down and ask, they don't think Partition was such a bad thing. Partition reduced the proportion of Muslim population vis-a-vis Hindus, how could it be a bad thing?
"Narendra Modi is the best thing that could have happened to Pakistan," veteran Pakistani journalist Ayaz Amir wrote recently. "He is making India look like General Zia's Pakistan. Can there be a bigger favour to Pakistan than that?" he asked.He writes what India looks like from Pakistan these days: "Assaults on liberalism, threats to free speech, people killed because of their beliefs or what they stand for, hate and bigotry on the loose, extreme expressions of religiosity, indeed religion entering the political discourse like never before...these were things that were supposed to happen in Pakistan."
"Narendra Modi is a godsend to Pakistan. More power to Hindutva," Ayaz Amir writes. Amit Shah should read his column to realise Pakistanis would actually burst crackers not if the BJP loses Bihar, but if it wins Bihar.
No matter who wins Bihar, the falling depths of the BJP's communalised campaign have already made India lose some of its claim to moral superiority over Pakistan.
Pakistanis won't need to wait till 8 November to say, in Fahmida Riaz's words:Tum bilkul hum jaisey nikley
ab tak kahaan chhupe thay bhai

                            Its funny to watch hindutvavadis tell you that they will kill to protect hindus sentiments &amp; in the same breadth declare how hinduism is the most tolerant &amp; diverse religion. The truth is that Hinduism was never a non-violent religion like how Gandhi would like you to believe.  It has always been systematically oppressive of low-castes &amp; of women. So all this resurgence of hindu-violence against dalits or minorities are nothing new and totally in line with the upper-caste sanctimonious nature of the hindu religion. If you are dalit/scst you are not seen as the true inheritors of hinduism. Its always the Brahmin's whose beleifs reign supreme.

Being from MP we had same hopes of development and communal harmony from Modi Ji as Shivraj Singh Ji has proved in his 15 years. 43% of Muslim vote in MP went to BJP in the last election. A lesson for Modi Ji to learn from MP.

                            Nice article by Mr. Shivam. I agree with the writer's view that Pakistan will never like to see Modi loose. There are two aspects to it, first one if Modi wins harliner voices become more louder and this will serve the ineterest of pakistan. Second aspect if Modi wins they may reach to simple majority in upper house and pass constitutional amendments suiting to RSS ideology like Cow slaghter ban across country, Uniform Civil code and removal of article 370 ( step towards Hindu Rashtra).Pakistan will be happy if India loses secular tag.

                            Amit Shah is sounding more like the meaning of his Name - a Lot more than necessary. Does he mean all those who won't vote for BJP are supporters of Pakistan? By that logic, majority Indians are supporters of Pakistan as combined opposition got more votes in the General Elections. Does he even think beyond winning elections? Is winning elections at all costs the be all and end all of this guy? Just go all out Mister, at least clearly declare you care for no one else in this country except Sangh Parivar and its sympathisers. You can even suggest, as your loose mouthed but more honest law maker colleagues of BJP would do, that all those who do not want to vote for BJP can go to Pakistan? Please come out with it instead of this cloak and daggers game. Be a Man. Show your true feelings. Then let the nation decide if you are worth the hype and hoopla of being Chanakya. Its an insult to Chanakya.

Vij should spend some time reading articles in Dawn, a supposedly moderate paper, and will find every article on India critical of Modi. The Pakistani media is scared of its security establishment &amp; wild that Modi called its bluff on talks. Dr Singh &amp; Vajpayee made Indians sick by grovelling before Pakistan. We need peace with Pakistan but not by surrendering. Modi has brought a different strategy - ignore Pakistan as talks with terrorists are meaningless. Let it show us that they will abide by their commitments on terror &amp; then we can talk of other subjects.

But the most important thing that was forgotten in this forceful matching of our PM and his impact on Pakistan is that for the one time i can see there is confidence in us and kind of irritation for pakistan just because of the same reasons - Mr Modi

                            Exactly! Pakistani extremism feeds on Hindutva fanaticism. They are two sides of the same coin, mirror images of each other. Extremism in Pakistan has just got a fresh lease of life, thanks to revival of the Hindu nationalistic revival. It's the raison d'etre for these two extremes ideologies to grow and thrive. If one begins to wither,the other also begins to die.

                            People of Pakistan doesn't give a damn about whats happening in a state in India. Why? Because they are more tied up with their own problems. Terrorism, Unemployment, their own Government, clean water, security, threat of new terrorist organisations. They are hanging on to their dear lives. Modi wins or loses, will it affect any of these problems for them? I don't think so.<br/>
It is the politicians like Amit Shah who just for the sake of votes will speak anything even if it is not right. He has no respect for democracy. He wants to get into power by hook or by crook. He doesn't think once that his statements are causing hurt to the delicate balance we have in our country.

                            Shivam Vij..another liberal rant! Modi is taking India in the right direction. Get over it. Communal episodes have been happening in India since its existence and peaked during congress days. But liberals like you and the media just want to highlight and exaggerate the current few events which by the way are being encouraged and planted by congress. They can only fight this way. They have nothing else left. Media invites Sharukh Khan for his bit. Who is he? Just an actor. Liberals wake up. Liberalism is a disease. A disease that was defeated when PM Modi got elected. Accept it and move on. PM Modi: Please keep doing what you are doing. Take the country towards progress and keep pests like Pakistan in its place. I am very proud to see madeinIndia ad on American tv channels. Thanks to you and your vision!!!! Love and respect PM Modi. Salute!

You can not impose your views to every reader. Total absurd from the writer. Definitely Pakistan is not looking for a prime minster so aggressive like Modi. They definitely want to see India similar to their country with so much internal problems.

Modi has just came to power an year back and what he has done to counter Pakistan at world stage is clearly a blow to Pakistani Government and Army. Modi has created a new doctrine on how to deal with Pakistan. He has successfully decoupled India from Pakistan on world stage.

Open your eyes and understand ISIS - manifestation of Muslim mentality that Hindus experienced for 700 years at the cost of dishounor and death. Muslims haven't changed a bit. Non-violence of Mahatma Gandhi is resulting into so much violence today. This great soul just made one mistake of believing Muslims. Genocide in the near future is sure.

                            The author is talking nonsense. You only have to go to Pakistani newspaper websites and read forum posts to find out how much Pakistanis hate Modi. The author also assumes that Modi is planning to make Muslims second class citizens without any substantiation. Modi has spoken of inclusive growth all along. Beef bans existed in India since 1955 and the Dadri lynching is a one off hate crime Akhilesh Yadav's UP. The murders of rationalists in Karnataka and Maharashtra happened under congress regime. I think the BJP government should act against `secular liberals' who are provoking Muslims against Hindu just because this government rightly ignores them.
