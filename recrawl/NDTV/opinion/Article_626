Headline::::AAPs 100 Days Limited To Shrill Confrontation



DateTime::::2015-05-25T22:32:00+05:30




                                Destiny sometimes rewards exceptionally. Thereafter, the focus shifts to the beneficiary and what is made of the opportunity offered.
 
In Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal and his AAP had a blitzkrieg of a mandate in February by winning all but three of 70 seats in the Assembly. During electioneering, AAP made specific promises with offers to different segments of society. Key promises included installing 15 lakh CCTV cameras to improve women's safety, building 500 new schools to solve the crisis of admissions, creating 900 new Primary Health Centers and adding 30,000 beds in Delhi's hospitals, among many others.
 
The first 100 days of the AAP in government are now over. The easiest part, of doling out subsidised water and electricity, have been implemented. Where the funds to maintain machinery and mechanisms will come from is not clear. Another populist promise of free Wi-Fi in public spaces across Delhi is said to be on the cards in the near future. What effect that will have on safety and security, with free porn available to watch for idle youth at every street corner, is yet to be even considered.
 
No doubt a section of the voters are delighted. Others are apprehensive about whether the rest of his manifesto promises were merely a chimera to garner votes or an agenda for actual implementation. These require planning, and sustained effort to deliver them on the ground.
 
The magnitude of implementing these promises is particularly easy for Mr Kejriwal to calculate. He is, after all an IIT alumnus and former Indian Revenue Services officer. Assuming the first six months as an introductory period of settling in, and setting aside the last six months for elections in 2019, the AAP government has exactly four years or 48 months to implement their agenda.
 
15 lakh CCTV cameras translate into 31,250 CCTVs needing to be installed every month - or over 1, 000 every day. Additionally, systems and monitoring staff to manage this mega project are required. Approximately 10 new schools, 19 Primary Health Centres and 625 additional hospital beds also need to be added every month if AAP wants to keep its word.
 
The calculations for building 2 lakh toilets across Delhi (about 1.5 lakh toilets in slums and clusters and 50,000 toilets in public area) and ensuring every village has a school and hospital without forcible land acquisition are no less challenging tasks to implement.
 
So far there is no indication of progress on these mega promises. Instead, the AAP has continued with a preference for shifting the focus from work through allegations and defamatory statements against one and all whom they perceive their enemy, within the party or externally.  
 
The latest controversy concerns an interpretation on who controls the transfer and posting of central government officials in Delhi. Legal opinions are available backing both the Lieutenant Governor (and the Central Government) on one side, and the Chief Minister on the other. Perhaps the AAP will take the issue to the Supreme Court for a final word. A special session of the State Assembly has also been called on the issue.
 
In the meanwhile, Mr Kejriwal need not forget that no one is preventing him from transferring thousands of other officers who are not from the central services like the IAS and IPS.
 
Team Kejriwal is within its rights to pick the political issues it wishes to confront. However, that cannot be a convenient escape route to shift focus from what the AAP government has promised to deliver. Perhaps he could also look for lessons from the track record of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which has implemented mega schemes. In less than eight months, 15 crore new bank accounts have been opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana or PMJDY programme (that's nearly 19 lakh accounts per month or 6,25,000 accounts per day).
 
Since its launch on May 10, over 7 crore people have signed up for the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (accident insurance cover for Rs. 2 lakh at Rs. 12 per annum) and Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Scheme (Rs. 2 lakh insurance policy at Rs. 330 per annum). The third scheme, Atal Pension Yojana, also progresses. Evidently, the challenge of financial inclusion, social security and insurance cover for marginalised Indians is already on the path to delivery. These are but a few successes of Narendra Modi's government.
 
The BJP has publically accepted responsibility to be judged on the delivery of its 2014 manifesto at the end of its tenure. The question is whether Team Kejriwal is courageous enough to be judged on the implementation of their manifesto and promises.
 
So far, Team Kejriwal, regretfully, has consistently displayed a marked preference for a shrill campaign of confrontation and allegations instead of responsible governance. Here's where one recalls Abraham Lincoln sage comment - "You can fool some of the people all the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all the time."(Nalin S Kohli is spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Director of the party's Public Policy Research Centre.

BJP needs more sensible spokesperson if it seriously wants to win over people of Delhi or rest of countries. FYI - I am not an AAPtard nor a Modi Bhakt nor a Cong fan.

How about the blackmoney in Real estate ? PM diverts the nation by saying all the blackmoney is in abroad ? There is no action on them till now.<br/><br/>
How about independent CBI ? Jan lokpal bill ? Anti corruption units ? Police reforms ? BJP - please speak about governance <br/><br/>

                            Nalin you are the most arrogant spokesperson in making, but don't be so blind in the process of that. AAP government has performed better than any other government in Indepedent India in the first 100 days. They have already delivered upon the key promises like electricity and water. Corruption has come down with the new anti-corruption helpline. Authorization of colonies are in progress. Participatory democracy is getting a new trend. Your party is absolutely scared of thew new style of governance in Delhi and you tried to clip their wings through the sole decisions of a nominated person called LG. Today's high court rule is a slap on your face. Perhaps you wrote this article before that. Sorry Nalin, no more you can fool us common people.

                            Mr. Kohli if you say you are opening 19 lakh accounts a month that comes out to a figure of around 63 thousand accounts a day, not ten fold 62 lakh accounts a day. <br/><br/>
You don't know elementary maths and you are questioning complicated and intricate policies of a party? <br/><br/>
Also I so badly hope Kejriwal doesn't follow Modi's U-turn model of governance, last heard the count was in the hundreds. And he has just completed a year. I remember you were the same person making noise on television sets across the country before the 7th of Feb, as soon as the opinion polls came it convincingly shut you up, it was even worse when the results actually came, whereas all the while you were predicting a huge win for BJP. <br/><br/>
Lincoln's quote is perhaps most suitable on you, as they say, don't cry wolf too often Mr.Kohli.

                            Leave AK and AAP alone. He won a majority in Delhi and people have voted him as they have seen what he did. He maybe new but yes he wants to eradicate corruption. He maybe cannot speak but he will learn. maybe he does not know governance but he can do something for the poor. So let him do what he wants to do as he is elected by the people and for the people.

                            Dear Mr. Kohli. Your government of you have no right to question Mr. Kejriwal. What about your promise to get all black money back to India and depositing 15 lacs rupees to every Indian? What about building a Ram temple in Ayodhya? What about the article 370 in Kashmir? What about taking action on Mr. Vadhara? Where are the achche din? So please don't talk about somebody else's promises when you haven't fulfilled any of yours. At least Kejriwal's intentions are pure. I am sure that with all odds and almighty central government against it, Kejriwal government will make a Delhi better place to live in next 4 years. All being said, I truly believe that BJP for now if the best government we can have at the center and AAP for Delhi. Awaiting a day when we will have AAP government at the center ad well. I an sure Mr. Kohli and his colleagues fear for that day the most and that's why you are so afraid and propagate negativity throughout. By the way, even your knowledge, Delhi HC has vindicated Kejriwal's stand in the ongoing contravercy with Jung. You guys wanted to run the Delhi government with backdoor and your hypocracy is exposed.

                            Mr. Kohli, thanks for your enlightening article. However the comparison with 1 year BJP rule is automatic. I am sure the the achhe din has arrived for the Corporate and Mr. Modi himself. For the poor men, it is still the same struggle, even harder. The threat of the land acquisition in the horizon. The state of health, education, security, corruption are all the same. We have not received any black money back in India, when reminded of this poll promise, Ms. Sitharaman called it childish. What an arrogance, if BJP cannot fulfill this promise, they should say sorry. Unfortunately this word does not exist in the dictionary of Mr. Modi. When will BJP realise that HYPE and drama cannot fill the void any more.

Took support from Congress, he said was a Party of Corruption. Then lied about why he resigned. Now he is lying again about interference. The secretary appointed for 10 days about two weeks ago. What has AAP of Kejri been doing for 90 days before this appointment? Thinking of excuses.

In case of AAP, they made tall promises and want an excuse in the form of confrontation with the Center.<br/>

If BJP can support a right wing anti national PDP in J&amp;k which has lead to raising paki flags on a daily basis in Srinagar , why not support AAP who are our own people, minnows in front if the BJP trying to make a difference on the ground level.

                            AAP has done remarkably well in 100 days. It has confronted everything Central government has said. It has confronted LG of Delhi. It has confronted Media. It has confronted it's own members. It has confronted Delhi police. It has confronted it's pet project LOKPAL bill. It has been confronting it's own promises made during elections. So what else do you want???? Without confrontation how will it survive. It's a good strategy to cover up it's false promises.

                            Hello Sir, <br/><br/>
read this artical and I feel you havent been very fair. I can understand that you are spokesperson of BJP so no doubt you will take BJP's side. <br/>
still your comparison hasn't been fair. <br/>
You call water and electricity as easy promises.. I would like to request you to implement that for all India; if you can. You have raised question about free wifi, I think you forgot that there are easy ways to block certain sites, keywords, domains. And afterall all world is doing this.. you go to starbucks you get free wifi.. and many other places.. so i dont think its hard to manage that as this is not very new thing. <br/><br/>
One hand you call water and electricity very easy things.. and other hand.. you promote opening accounts in bank as big achievement. I dont need to say but for a common man.. water and electricity are more important.<br/><br/>
You count about CCTV and School promises.. but you forgot.. we are comparing 100 days vs 1 year. and you say about accident and life insurance..thats really good.. we can count it as BJP's plus points. <br/><br/>
One biggest issue we always talk about is corruption... I think we all Indian people can understand.. how big issue is this..if we can solve this then we can find solution to all other problems.. we all know that... and AAP for sure is far far ahead from BJP in this... and funny thing is BJP is fighting.. that who should come under ACB.. May I know why ??? do you have any other strong ACB of center..I think part of BJP should stop doing all this.. and help Delhi govt for better India... and should not create problems.. <br/><br/>
one recent fighting was with LG... and now court has ordered.. so no doubt who was wrong.. please.. request you not to do this again.. I love BJP.. and wanted BJP to come in Power.. please dont create bad image of yourself... BJP and AAP should exchange ideas and help each other.. AAP is doing good.. faster than your pace.. but..its OK.. you have time to improve and you should go in that direction.

                            The High Court has not upheld the Indian Constitution but has tried to side with an elected representative. Farjiwal has to take up this matter in the Rajya Sabha question hour to modify the provisions of the constitution to allow him the final say. But he will sit in a dharna like a roadside loafer. He has zero seats in Lok Sabha because of 49 day Mahatma Farjiwal CM episode so no question hour for him. Meanwhile Delhi people realise, electricity bill has gone down but Rickshaw bill has gone up more than electricity. Household budgets will suffer and then Delhi will wake up. Wait till Kejriwal stops paying electricity dues and then Delhi will face blackout even when there is uninterrupted power in the system for Farjiwal to buy but he has no money and of course Centre is to be blamed for everything. I hope he does not put the entire Delhi government machinery in Jail for corruption. Who will run Delhi then?

Lets not even discuss black money here......so just relax and give them a long rope just like you expect your own govt at the center to be given. Meanwhile, it would be pretty nice if your govt stops meddling with the Delhi govt's affairs and not act like vamps in a saas bahu serial on TV.

                            What has your government delivered so far? You please see your manifesto then you would know the facts. You have not talked about civil services reform, police reform. And, you have already screwed Indian judicial system by putting politicians on the committee which appoints sr. judges.<br/>
Further, you are trying to take away the rights of an elected government which has clear mandate from Delhi. Remember, when Congress tried to enforce its views in Gujarat through Governor and Modi was shouting here and there.<br/>
I am not a fan of AAP esp., recently but the behavior of your government and party is simply pathetic. You all are disgusting to the core. You all have appointed several incompetent ministers e.g. Irani as MHRD chief, whose only skill is being a sycophant of MODI and the list is long. Your government is truly disgusting. Correct yourself before you shout at others.

Every one should respect the will of people in Democracy. People like Kohli are behaving like Congress - good for nothing but always trying to find faults. BJP is doing a big mistake by interfering in Delhi.They should not behave like a sore loser and concentrate on governance, create more jobs and alleviate poverty...

AAP has very difficult days ahead to do things it promised. It's not an easy job and cannot fulfill all the promises. You need this kind of confrontation politics to cover up the failures.. I like AK's strategy and it is working well for him and his party. Good Luck Delhites.

AAP and AK need to think hard and fast how they will fulfill those promises. Else they will look like just another party that promises a lot but does not deliver anything after election's. AAP will actually look worse - did not deliver +  wasted time accusing center and lt. General.

                            When is AK bringing the jan lokpal bill? What is he afraid of? AK is falling in to a trap laid for him by BJP. The conspiracy is this; AK is basically an egoistic person who does not like anyone saying no to him. BJP is doing just that on non-issues and on issues where the legal position is either favoring the center or is unclear. BJP is depending upon AK resigning again in a huff as AK is also sufficiently delusional that he will think this "sacrifice" is being demanded of him by people of Delhi. I understand that people of Delhi have been fooled twice by AK and henchmen, but will they be fooled thrice? That is the moot question. Under any circumstances, I do not expect the AAP regime (misrule rather) to last the full term. I think, there are murmurs of dissent again from within the AAP and this will again snowball in to washing of dirty linen in public very soon. The shrill meaningless campaign by AK might be an effort to divert attention from AAP internal fights as well.

                            Destiny has worked more favourably for Mr. N.D.Modi, who with only 30-31% of the total voted polls has come to be India's PM and who along with his spokespersons has "consistently displayed a marked preference for a soothingly sweet campaign of amiability  and eulogies (for his opponents) instead of irresponsible spending  hundreds/thousands of crores of ill-gotten money on posters and media like AAP did who consistently for seven days carried on nasty cartoons vilifying Mr. N. D. Modi and his family thereby falling into the nadir of decency." When the AAP received its 53% mandate it received it from the world war II's Nazi strategy, but when Mr. N.D.Modi received his most respected, dapper like 31%, it was a well-earned, most respected whisper of approbation from God himself. When Mr. N.D. Modi's government has done an enormously earth-shaking work of opening bank accounts, and coating fertilizer and meeting 137 heads of states for the lion's sake in His 365 earthly days, Mr. AAP hasn't done a single thing in His 100 terrestrial days except for ousting Yogendra Madhok, Govinda Bhushan and finally with a soft push Prof. Advani and some more. Mr. AAP should also be very careful about His working on the Wi Fi, for all the young employed persons turned idle by the AAP elements  in all the preceding governments of the UPA, NDA and Congress of various hues and cries, will be busy seeing Pornography now on; that is the only use AAP spokesman and his cronies know about of the Internet. Weren't those the AAP MPs who were caught by media watching Porno in the parliament? Look at the grandeur of the BJP's Moses who speaks on behalf of God. He now, for His government quotes Lincoln: "Government buys the people, forages the people, off the people." Jest a little mate, I too cannot come off my elitist pedestal to be should-to-shoulder with the riff raff of the AAP whom one of you in the company of "sweet ladies" quoting Michaelangelo, in the dappers' club once called "guttersnipes", "Third rate people", "Mango people," and many more names.

                            It is a sad reflection on BJPs performance. After one year in office all they have to show are bank accounts for which majority doesn't have any cash to deposit and hijack insurance schemes with PM s name stamped them.

                            Kejriwal listed out why he could not perform because a Secretary had been appointed for a mere 10 days. Because she got appointed for 10 days, was locked out of her office by Kejriwal's side-kicks, AAP was unable to deliver anything. Of course, before the lock out of temporary Chief Secretary (which was okayed by his deputy), AAP was embroiled in an ugly war within itself that had Kejriwal and his band of followers against Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav. That infighting , still going on, took up the first 90 days of AAP time. Of course, during that Kejriwal was also in Bangalore having his cough fixed. So AAP has really not had much time to give to Governance of Delhi. They have pre-occupied themselves with their little problems. Given their self obsession how could they focus on their promises of Free power, free water, free wi fi, hundreds of thousands of cameras, free schools, free universities and a corruption free Delhi. After all Charity begins at home. AAP has to free itself of Corruption within its own ranks, and it needs to start at the top With Kejriwal. Whose entire life is spent making allegations against people and so far he has been miserably unsuccessful at proving anything. the man is an utter failure.

                            What's good for Modi is terrible for Kejriwal. Progress and development started only last year,BJP has all the answers; the rest of the country is a ship of fools. Oh,Ok we get it ; now stop writing this drivel and get back to your main job of Modi worshipping.

                            Thanks for an Eye-opener Mr.Kohli. How about critical examination of the government at the center? As a politician you ought to defend but as a writer I think one should not be biased
