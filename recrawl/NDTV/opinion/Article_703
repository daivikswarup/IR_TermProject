Headline::::A Kerala Port with Adani. Why That's a Good Thing.



DateTime::::2015-07-13T14:48:00+05:30




                                Vizhinjam is a somewhat sleepy fishing village at the southern periphery of Kerala's capital, Thiruvananthapuram. It is a picturesque place, with an attractive lighthouse, acres of beachfront and a small harbour crowded with fishing vessels.
 
That is today. But tomorrow it could be the deepest seaport in India and a trans-shipment hub for all of southern India, if not the whole country and the wider Indian Ocean Rim region.
 
One problem: the Vizhinjam Port bid has been won by Adani Ports, whose owner has been reviled by many as a beneficiary of "crony capitalist" practices by the present ruling party in Delhi. Many well-meaning liberals, including in Congress-ruled Kerala, are appalled at the prospect.
 
Let's look at what's at stake here. Ships carry 90% of the world's goods across the seas; for decades, they have not been the preferred mode of passenger movement, but when we speak of international trade, we speak of shipping. Mainline container vessels or "mother ships" carry goods to major, deep-water ports, from where they are transferred to smaller "feeder vessels" that take them to smaller, shallower ports, in a process known as trans-shipment. This enables goods to be transported at the lowest cost to and from relatively shallow ports, which include most of India's existing so-called major ports like Mumbai and Visakhapatanam.
 
Despite India having enjoyed steady economic growth over the last fifteen years, the vast majority of India's container traffic is either being trans-shipped at ports outside the country, mainly at Colombo (Sri Lanka), Singapore, Port Klang and Tanjung Pelapas (Malaysia), Salalah (Oman), and Jebel Ali (Dubai), or delivered by smaller, less efficient ships directly to relatively shallow Indian ports. This is because India currently has no major all-weather, deep-water port near the international sea routes to handle large mainline container vessels. 
As a result Colombo trans-ships more Indian goods than all of India's own ports. There is a serious geopolitical angle to being dependent on Colombo for transshipment, since its latest and biggest terminal is now operated by a Chinese firm. India prohibits Chinese firms from investing in or building its ports, but in effect condones the transshipment of the lion's share of our cargo via a Chinese-operated port where Chinese Navy submarines regularly call for resupply. 
 
Most of the major ships carrying cargo between East Asia and Africa, and between Europe and East Asia, pass directly through or go very near Indian territorial waters. Currently, a significant number of these ships break their bulk at Colombo, Singapore or Dubai, with the majority of the cargo meant for India or the rest of South Asia. 
 
It doesn't have to be this way. Vizhinjam is uniquely located close to the shipping routes between Asia and Europe. The key Suez-Malacca shipping lane runs very close to Vizhinjam, some ten nautical miles away, much closer than to any other Indian port. With changing technology, bigger vessels -- such as the 19,224 TEU MSC Oscar, the 19,100 TEU CSCL Globe or the 18,000 TEU Maersk Triple-E class -- are becoming popular because of their economies of scale and the consequent reduction in shipping costs. ("Triple E" refers to "Economies of scale", "Energy efficient" and "environmentally improved"; the TEU figure correlates to the number of twenty-foot containers that can be carried by the vessel).
 
Ships of over 18,000 TEUs are the future of sea cargo because they involve lower costs per container shipped. But bigger ships require deeper ports. Typically a vessel greater than 10,000 TEUs in size requires water depth greater than 14 metres to operate safely in. This has to be artificially created through costly dredging in most transshipment hubs across the globe, whereas Vizhinjam has a natural un-dredged draft of up to 24 meters, perfect for all mother vessels. Ships of up to 20,000 TEU or more can easily berth there from day one.
A few years ago, Kerala tried to break into the trans-shipment market with Vallarpadam terminal in Kochi, which unfortunately has struggled to maintain even 10 meters of depth through daily dredging. It has also struggled with legacy unionization and tariff related constraints on account of it being part of a Government of India-controlled Major Port. Since 21st century ports require longer terminals, deeper drafts and bigger "turning basins" than Vallarpadam can provide, the project has not even been able to attract significant direct cargo, far less any transshipment traffic. It's typical of Kerala's politics that with Vizhinjam available, decision-makers developed Vallarpadam first.
 
However everything that's wrong with Vallarpadam can and should be remedied at Vizhinjam. It is the deepest natural port in India, with an operating draft of 21-24 metres and minimal littoral drift, which means no maintenance dredging would be required and O&M [operating and maintenance] costs would be minimized. It is as close to the key shipping lanes as Colombo is, and being a greenfield port, has no legacy unionization issues. In fact its strategic location on the tip of the peninsula provides not just proximity to the international shipping lanes but also equidistance from both West and East Coast Indian ports. Since Vizhinjam would be built from scratch, it has the ability to deploy "best in class" equipment without being burdened by legacy facilities. It can be highly mechanized and have world-class efficiency (given the right operator). Vizhinjam could handle the largest ships in the world as efficiently as Singapore, Hong Kong or Rotterdam for decades to come.
 
India suffers from high logistics costs because of the lack of direct calls by main shipping lines and the lack of a domestic transshipment port capable of handling such giants. We have a 7516.6 kilometre coastline and nearly 200 ports, but most - even our 13 so-called "Major Ports" -- have depth of between nine to eleven metres. As a result we cannot dock or service any of the bigger ships now plying international waters; they offload our goods in foreign ports. In effect, our economy is helping to pay for ports like Colombo, Salalah and Tanjung Pelapas, while our exports remain relatively uncompetitive and our imports become more expensive. The Indian economy will remain less competitive compared to those of China, Singapore or Malaysia till we have a domestic deep-water transshipment terminal. Vizhinjam is the most pragmatic and immediate answer.
 
The Vizhinjam project has already received the necessary environmental and Coastal Zone Regulation clearance. It has attracted Viability Gap Funding of Rs. 800 crores from the Central Government. The State government has already acquired 90% of the land required for the project and begun work on road and rail connectivity. Electrical and water supply lines are being established. The project, with a capital cost of Rs. 6647 crore, has been structured as a Public-Private partnership with the State Government as landlord, on a "Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer" basis.
 
Despite having these advantages, for various reasons, we failed to secure a viable bid to build and operate the port in the last 25 years. The current winning bid, in the fourth bid process over the last decade or so, is the last chance for Vizhinjam.
 
With each passing year, escalation in project costs, the development of rival ports and competition from existing international ports like Colombo and Hambantota poses serious challenges to the project's viability. So we should all understand that this is a now or never situation. 
 
Which brings us back to Adani Ports. Should the Vizhinjam project be deferred rather than give it to Narendra Modi's favourite capitalist? As Deng Xiao Ping had memorably said, "I don't care if the cat is black or white, so long as it catches mice." Adani Ports is India's leading private sector port developer and operator, and operates India's most sophisticated and fastest growing container port that may soon unseat Mumbai's Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust as India's top container port. Adani Ports won the tender process for Vizhinjam fair and square. Other considerations are frankly beside the point.
 
If Vizhinjam's only credible bidder is denied this opportunity, Adani Ports will simply move down the coast to where a red carpet awaits them, in Tamil Nadu's fledgling port of Colachel, represented by a BJP MP. This would neither be in Kerala's interest nor in that of the nation, since Vizhinjam is both deeper and better situated than its rival, but capital will flow where it is most welcome and where it feels most secure. 
 
A golden opportunity beckons. From the Vizhinjam lighthouse, the horizon glows at sunrise. If the port is built, the prospects are as stunning as the view. It is time we put development ahead of politics and embraced the bid in order to develop the project without any further delay, in the best interests of the people of Trivandrum -- and of India as a whole.

                            The port sounds fine, however Kerala needs to get its infrastructure right to handle the port traffic. The NH stretch from TVM to Allepey is just a 2 lane narrow highway which is already choked with traffic making travel expensive and time consuming. Adding slow moving containers onto such a narrow stretch would make an already risky road , a death trap.

                            Tamil Nadu's port of Colachel(Natural Harbour), represented by the BJP MP Pon Radhakrishnan is located better than Vizhinjam and is more closer to Cape Comerin where Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea meet. It also has a natural un-dredged draft of up to 20-24 meters as Vizhinjam. Also Colachel can be well connected to Railways, Roadways and Airways as they are merely few kilometers away. So your point is whether the project is given to Tamil Nadu or Kerela. So please dont say that it is not in the interest of the Nation as Colachel is more suitable to have an international shiping port than Vizhinjam. Colachel natural harbour has been used for centuries for shipping and is the best choice.

                            @KPadmadasan: Dare say where that "somewhere else" is?? The real problems for Vallarpadam are (1).INDEED the DRAFT; (2). Exhorbant millions spent every year to maintain atleast 12m. DRAFT; (3).Dubai Port World (who manages the Vallarpadam port) not interested in improving its prospects; rather, happy with just extracting periodic commission as profits regardless of the Traffic generated.<br/><br/>
No point in denying(1)&amp;(2) till end. Many ships today require more than 13m draft and vallarpdam cant even manage 12m. WITH daily round-the-year Dredging! Why? because it is an Estuary Port situated in a Lake (not in Open Sea).<br/><br/>
Infact, it was only to satisfy the ego of Kerala Congress that Vallarpadam was preferred to Vizhinjam a decade ago and look what a state it is in today! <br/><br/>
Why? Because Kerala Congress (an ally of Indian National Congress) &amp; A.K.Antony know Vallarpadam's City (Kochi) is their mighty impregnable Fort and promoting Investment there and ensuring Kochi as the Economic Centre of Kerala would secure them the unquestioned Control of the State.<br/><br/>
Infact, Vallarpadom is only one of the many Projects (in the last 2 decades) which would initially be planned for the State Capital &amp; elsewhere, then silently gets hijacked to Kochi by the famed Congress-wala's.

                            It does indeed make sense to award the contract to Adani.  Ironic that Kerala with a substantial Communist population wasn't able to make much economic progress in terms of infrastructure development and has to now rely on a Capitalist like Adani.  I fear though that arch Communist Mr Brinda Karat (also known as Prakash) will make trouble for Adani and drive him out straight into the hands of Tamil Nadu.  After all, Tata was driven out of Bengal and Gujarat gained.  A sure fire way of getting the port built in Kerala is to gain the support of Tharoor's boss, Sonia Gandhi.  Tharoor can easily convince Sonia to lend her support by pointing out that she can more easily export the loot of India to her native Italy through a deep water port rather than relying on aircraft that can only carry so much!

                            Last I heard, Chief Minister of Kerala Oomen Chandy was reprimanded by the Congress High Command to express their displeasure of the CM giving it away to Adani. Who are you fooling Dr. Tharoor ? <br/><br/>
IOCL was constructing an LPG terminal in Cochin, but due to locals going bonkers, the project went to Ennore (Single Point Mooring) in Tamil Nadu. <br/><br/>
The Vallarpadom International Container Transshipment Terminal(ICTT), is the biggest scam in Kerala's history. I had the privilege of being a part of a presentation by the Chairman of Cochin Port Trust about how the terminal run by the Dubai Port World (DPW) will revolutionize Kerala's ports. All that money to create a separate road link and a rail link to the terminal and installing the super expensive quay cranes, everything has gone down the drain. The project will never break even. There was news regarding CISF not being paid for several months together by DPW for providing security to the ICTT.<br/><br/>
Who is accountable ?<br/><br/>
In my opinion, it will be better for Adani to go to Colachel in Tamil Nadu. I am pretty sure that the TN Government will spend money in creating a freight corridor from Colachel either by road or rail to transport the containers to Chennai or Ennore Ports and thereby avoiding going around Sri Lanka.

                            Agreed that we need a major deep water port. But in Kerala? There might be a labour strike every other day.

                            MrTharoor I respect u for ur unbiased view. Its great to see u rise above petty politics in the larger intrest of the country. Vizhinjam project is good for Trivandrum, Kerala and India. The the strong lobbying against this important project is nothing but anti national.

                            If Vallardpadam is not attracting traffic what makes you think that Vizhinjam will.  It is not because of insufficient draft that container traffic is not attracted towards the port.The problems lie some where else. Vizhinjam will face the same problem : lack of traffic. The proposed port will hardly generate any employment as it is meant to be a transhipment terminal. Vizhinjam will only satisfy the ego of some people but over the years it will leave two dead investments : Vallarpadam and Vizhinjam.

                            Good thinking Mr.Tharoor. India will surely make progress if all politicians think like you. We should at least keep politics out of infrastructure development. As an Indian we don't care whether the port is in Congress MP's area or BJP MP's. It must be at the right location.

                            Very informative article. A mature and sensible view from an MP who truly wants to see the progress of the country.
