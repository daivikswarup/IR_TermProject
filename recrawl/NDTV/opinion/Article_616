Headline::::What Rahul Gandhi's Telangana Tour Did For the Congress



DateTime::::2015-05-18T16:55:00+05:30




                                It has been a year since Narendra Modi's triumphant election as Prime Minister. Back in May 2014, even as the results of the elections were being declared across the country, some commentators were rushing to publish obituaries of India's oldest political party. Some said that Modi's election heralded the birth of a "second republic" in India, in which the BJP would be the natural party of government. Others said, more bluntly, that the Congress Party was a spent force in Indian politics.
The outcome of the elections and the commentary it generated were especially painful for Congress members such as me in Telangana. After all, the creation of India's newest state was an act of rare political courage. The leadership of the Congress Party overcame extraordinary hurdles to honour the aspirations of the people of one India's most neglected and backward regions. Powerful forces were arrayed against Sonia Gandhi's principled decision to clear the way for Telangana's creation. She refused to yield to them. After all this, Telangana should have become a bastion of Congress support. Instead, our party performed dismally.
The reason for this was simple. Support for the now-in-power Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) party emanated primarily from the euphoria surrounding the state's creation. The credit for this should have gone to the Congress Party. But the TRS claimed it all for itself. The local Congress leadership should have forcefully challenged this false narrative. It did not, and we lost.
Contrary to the mythology constructed by the BJP, the Congress's loss in Telangana had nothing to do with the "Modi effect". Yet, if the response to Rahul Gandhi's padyatra last week is anything to go by, Telangana may well be regarded as the place where we witnessed the beginning of the end of Modi's national reign. As Rahul aptly noted, Telangana has
become a microcosm of Modi's India. As the government has gone about courting foreign investors to pour money into Hyderabad, hundreds of impoverished, debt-ridden farmers have committed suicides in rural Telangana. According to unofficial records, more than 700 farmers have committed suicide since Telangana's formation last year. The situation is so grave that the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has asked the Government of Telangana to submit a comprehensive report on the subject.
Rahul Gandhi arrived in Telangana's Adilabad District last week with a simple purpose: to comfort the relatives of the dead farmers, raise awareness of this unfolding calamity in the national consciousness, and to express solidarity with debt-ridden farmers. As one farmer in the district of Nizamabad told me, "At a time when politicians are busy denying the suffering of the poor and the rich have gained unrestricted access to netas, the knowledge that someone like Rahul Gandhi has our back fills me with hope." In a quarter of a century of political activism, I have rarely witnessed the level of enthusiasm and solidarity I saw among the crowds who marched last week in Telangana. The march was held under the aegis of the Congress Party, but it seemed almost to transcend politics. There was anger and sorrow, but there was also genuine hope that the government would at last be forced to pay attention to the neglected masses.
The BJP used to impugn Rahul as a "dilettante"; to its tragedy (but to the country's delight), it turns out that when he takes up a cause, his resolve is unshakeable. As he promised the crowds in Telangana on Friday, he has devoted himself to the cause of the farmer. He has committed the Congress Party to the kisans of the country. The BJP and Modiji will soon learn that their suited-booted businessmen friends cannot save them when the farmers of India decide to dispense with them. The winds are changing.
In India's youngest state, we can see signs of the Congress Party's countrywide revival. We can see hope.

                            Congress party is the party to forget. It can anytime come back... it has lot of gimmicks in it's pocket and can perform anytime. But Paadayatra in Telangana isn't  too early for congress?? it may loose its steam at the time of election. So should shut it's both and keep quiet for sometime.

                            What was the writer doing when farmers committed suicide during 10 years UPA rules.  Dis the writer bring the news of farmer suicides between 2004 and 2014 to the notice of Rahul Gandhi or she was afraid to speak the truth.

                            Here comes another Master Piece Classic!! Looks like every Tom, Dick &amp; Harry of Congress Party who wants to cut the line and prep himself/herself for a ticket in next election is resorting to these "Expert Opinions" on NDTV.<br/><br/>
Our expert refers to display of rare political courage in carving out "Telangana".  No wonder it took Congress party ten years, starting 2004, (after discounting earlier agitations from 60s and 70s) to muster that rare courage. It in fact took them last parliament session of their 10 year stint (needless to talk about TV coverage blackout) to display that rare courage. RARE COURAGE in fact!!<br/><br/>
Our expert author talks about 700 farmer suicides (shamelessly putting a number on unfortunate suicides, which have been a legacy of her party's mis-rule) since inception of Telangana. Would she enlighten us with numbers from earlier years, especially 2004 through 2014 when they were at the seat of power at both center and the state? While crunching those numbers, if at all, could she care to dig more and glance at the numbers carefully and explain us why in spite of her kisan committed Congress being in power for much of the time our kisan still resorts to suicide? Is it because they see a vote bank in keeping that hardworking kisan as he was from decades ago? Or is it because, our kisan committed congress leader, born with a silver spoon in his mouth, chooses to remain in a bubble and is supported by leaders as this author (majority of whom are from smaller bubbles), have a romanticized notion of our humble kisan, where kisan himself might want to get out of khet but alas cannot.<br/><br/>
Author touches upon Rahul's unshakeable resolve. If coming up with about half a dozen read outs during 10 year stint in parliament; jumping from one issue to another (alike an ambulance chaser), without taking anything to its logical conclusion; blabbering away without any reason, logic, rhyme, understanding (latest example being his accusations over food park in Amethi); coming up with clichéd phrases is an exhibition of resolve, then I guess it is. Albeit, a shameless and a futile one. <br/><br/>
If a rally meant to wake up slumbering members of local state party unit, attended by a handful of local ticket aspirants is politics transcending activism, it shows how aloof author has been in her quarter of a century of political activism. <br/><br/>
YOU CAN ONLY HOPE!!

                            It gave a strong message saying only after you commit suicide will congress come there for consoling and not support, and then generate votes out of it.<br/>
It also seems to say going on foreign trips that bring billions of dollars as investment for the development of the country as a whole is wrong and that the right thing to do is<br/>
Disappear completely like he did (probably in micky mouse costume in disneyland) and come back after many months of unknown suspicious activity.<br/>
And we need to trust a leader when we dont even know where he is ? Or ran away into hiding at a time of need ??????

                            Yes the Yatra has given hope to the farmers of Telangana. Its not always about votes there are no  elections in Telangana neither general nor local bodies. It was a Yatra of creating hope and comforting the farmers.

                            The enthusiasm claimed by the Author is evident because the entire party takes energy from people who are directly or indirectly linked to Nehru family or perhaps Indira's family. <br/>
But she forgets that any improvement in Telangana towards Congress will be a cause of concern for TRS and not BJP. Bjp was never there. <br/>
And claiming that Sonia fought for Telangana is not right. There are two parties which were very clear and loud about splitting the state to Telengana and rest of Andhra. They are TRS which started the movement and BJP which supported the same. What did they achieve out of it, is yet to be seen but that is the fact. Congress and Telugu Desham tried to play safe all the years and suddenly switched the stand and tried to claim the Credit.<br/>
Irrespective of all this, there will be no surprise if people move towards Congress just because Rahul start eating with them for a day. Thats the status of country all these years going by short memories.

                            The only person from Congress who write articles is Dr. Shashi Tharoor! Rest all are: (K. Jyothi Devi is a senior Congress Party member in Telangana, a former member of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly, a lawyer and an activist for women's rights.)<br/><br/>
Why is Tharoor sidelined?? Who should be in the center!!

                            We can only see one thing that is The final nail in the coffin for the Congress party!<br/><br/>
If you really cared about the farmers , then  you should offer solutions rather than criticise others! What did Congress party do to solve the problems of the farmers when they were in power ? <br/><br/>
It is time for Rahul to stop trying to act like a Hero , and perhaps quit politics and take a vacation in Italy , rather than play with the lives of poor people !
