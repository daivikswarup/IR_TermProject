Headline::::Like Rahul Gandhi, Modi Government Mishandles Student Protests



DateTime::::2016-01-23T23:19:00+05:30




                                Friday evening, RPN Singh, Congress leader and former Junior Home Minister, told the media that the PM does not realise the power of the youth which can wreck powerful governments.
Singh was replying to a question on the Modi government's handling of the suicide of 26-year-old Phd student Rohith Vemula, which has sparked nationwide protests and outrage over the insensitivity shown in dealing with the case.
Singh would know well the veracity of his statement for the youth of India gave a scathing and fitting indictment of the UPA with protests over the misuse of power and the then government's many errors including its handling of the Nirbhaya case.
Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, who was booed at Jantar Mantar by protestors when she visited the area to show her solidarity over the Nirbhaya case, could vouch for this.
One can well remember the television visuals that showed images of the Chief Minister protected by police officials before she was surrounded by protesters who shouted slogans like "Sheila Dikshit wapas jao" (go back).
Dikshit had made indifferent and inadequate statements over the gang-rape of a young doctor-in-the making, Jyoti Singh.
Jyoti, or Nirbhaya as we call her now, lost her life to the callousness of a dispensation which had put women's safety on the backburner despite an increase in rape cases. If this wasn't enough, Dikhsit's foot-in-mouth remark made things worse, not just for her, but her party. She claimed in the Delhi Assembly that "only one gang rape" had taken place during her regime.
As student protests got larger and angrier, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi tried damage control by reaching out to the family of Nirbhaya; the government then sent her to Singapore for treatment, but she did not survive. Meanwhile, in what resembled a scene straight out of a film, innocent protestors who were marching towards Rashtrapati Bhavan and the PM's residence were subjected to water canons and tear gas. Rahul Gandhi chose to meet student representatives much after the demonstrations had surged.
During its election campaign in 2014, the BJP did well by making women's safety a major issue; it cited the Nirbhaya case in television campaigns. One would have assumed that the Modi-led NDA government would have learnt from the mistakes of its predecessor, whose arrogance in dealing with student protestors was firmly rejected in the election by young Indians. But the Rohith Vemula suicide has proved that both the Congress and the BJP are equally out of synch with what the youth wants and needs.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one of the world's most social media-savvy heads of state, took five days to finally speak of Rohith's suicide which created a nationwide debate on Dalit discrimination. Speaking at the Bhimrao Ambedkar University in Lucknow on Friday, the PM extolled the virtues of the father of the Indian constitution. It was after some students shouted slogans against him that he spoke of Rohith, visibly moved as he declared "Mother India has lost a son."
The student dissent was not taken very kindly by the university which reportedly saw officials cancel the stay of the protesting students at the University hostel as a punitive measure - a step similar to the one taken by the Hyderabad university against Rohith Vemula.
PM Modi may have turned emotional and acknowledged the scalding pain of a young student's death, but check out the responses of his party members and HRD Minister Smriti Irani to the tragedy.
Murlidhar Rao, who is one of the most important leaders of the BJP and the RSS, said that Rohith's letter suggested that he was psychologically ill.  
Another party spokesperson, Sanju Verma, went on to label Rohith Vemulla as anti-national and called him a terrorist sympathizer. Her tweet read ".@BDUTT Did a disgruntled terror apologist, known for abusive anti-national rants (read his FB posts) drive himself to death? #TerrorApologist?
Wonder if Modiji indeed felt the pain of Rohith's grieveing mother who had to face the humiliation of her son being labelled anti-national.
Somebody had clearly not briefed PM Modi on the circumstances in which Rohith, who would have turned 27 this month, committed suicide. So here are a few details, Mr Prime Minister.
From July, the university had stopped paying Rohith his monthly stipend of Rs. 25,000 (excluding HRA). On August 5, the university set up an inquiry against Rohith and four other Ambedkar Students Association members, two days after they allegedly assaulted ABVP leader N Susheel Kumar.
Soon, union minister Bandaru Dattatreya wrote to HRD Minister Smriti Irani urging action and claiming that the Hyderabad University had become "a den of casteist, extremist and anti-national politics". The five members of the Ambedkar Students Association were suspended. In January, the five moved out of their hostel rooms to a tent they set up on the campus and began a hunger protest soon after which Rohith committed suicide, perhaps realizing the futility of fighting a lost battle in a country where all political parties are in a frenzy to appropriate Ambedkar but not his children.
As an aside to jog the BJP's memory, Ambedkar had faced the worst of criticism at the hands of RSS ideologue and then BJP member Arun Shourie in his book "Worshipping False Gods."
Last year, the RSS mouthpiece denounced Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University as an anti-national den while the HRD ministry in May 2015 took action against the Ambedkar Periyar Study circle at IIT Chennai for allegedly "spreading hatred" against the PM. And Smriti Irani, who refuses to see the caste angle in Rohith's suicide, may have phoned his mother to express her condolences, but cannot be cleared, according to this writer, of catering to majoritarian politics.
Like the Congress, which insists on presenting Rahul Gandhi as a youth icon despite not being able to connect with the youth in two consecutive terms of the UPA, our people's Prime Minister and his government too seems to have lost the plot in dealing with students. From waging a direct, unpopular battle with the students of the Film Institute to the Rohith Vemula tragedy, we have gone one step further in alienating minorities and dissenting young minds from the mainstream.(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer.

He was restigated based on rules n high court upheld his restigation? I feel these associations student unions shld be banned. Universities are for education not to make politics fightings n making antinational rants like sloganeering for Yakub etc

                            Hello Madam,<br/><br/>
It is you who don't know the complete story. If Mr.Modi don't say a word you will write he is quite and if says you will say "Wonder if Modiji indeed felt the pain of Rohith's grieveing mother ......". Do you understand what you are writing?<br/><br/>
Regarding facts,<br/><br/>
1. Rohit is proved to be a Non-Dalit, confirmed by his father (video is on youtube)<br/>
2. Yesterday, the police went to his village and confirmed the same, now how they got a fake caste certificate is a matter to be investigated, which is the reason the student union now not in favour of inquiry.<br/>
3. Which also means the case booked under SC/ST Act is void.<br/><br/>
Please check facts and write before jumping guns, good luck next time :-)

                            Protest must be within its limit, can't involve violence and supporting Anti-Terrorist. The Author and others who suggests wrong on administration, fails to understand the administrative rights to take action against them.

                            PM does not have to speak on everything, there are 135,000 suicide in india every year and i bet they would consist of people who ate dalit, maha dalit, super dalit, super duper dalit, muslims, hindus etc. PM cannot address each of them, and again even if he would have spoken on same day you guys would have found some other issue with his address. BTW i m not BJP supporter, i m AAP supporter which soon is going to change looking at their behavior and activities.

                            MY GOD WOMAN. Give yourself a break. Do you realize that no matter what PM Modi did, he would have failed to meet your expectations? I can bet that you cannot agree with anything PM Modi has said in his lifetime nor can you be appreciative of anything that Modi has ever done in his lifetime. When you know that he cannot do anything right why the expectation. Stop writing mindless blogs and make yourself useful if you can. You never supported BJP nor PM Modi. Even during 2019 elections please do not support the BJP or PM Modi. Politicizing everything, bringing caste, minority and religion angle into everything, dividing the nation on caste or religion lines is all you can do. Shame on you!!!!

                            A PM has to be discrete and sure of his facts, especially on sensitive issues, when he speaks. It is better that he takes his time, rather than shoot from the hip. Opposition politicians and media people can talk any nonsense and get away with it. Not the PM.

                            First of all, committing suicide itself is a sign of cowardness. Why we intend to showcase it as a heroic act and indirectly endorse it?<br/>
Why cant we see and keep our focus on the root issue which is bothering us? Why cant we question on how our beauraucracy or police department work? How can we assume only because of some politician acted erratic, he was compelled to commit suicide? There may be other factors also  and this is my observation that such incidents are being entertained as a block buster movie show on media channels since modi government took the power!! If there is so much agitation, then mediaworkers should try to find the solution also!!

                            I believe it would be too judgemental to hv said that a PM has responded too late about a sensitive issue because the least its people can do is to trust in the dignity &amp; believe in the ability to take the right calls at the right time in their own chosen representative. If they don't, why in the first place did they even vote for him and bring him on the throne. I personally believe PM Modi is a very able &amp; a determined leader who has what it takes to lift the nation to a brand new high.. I think both, his words &amp; his acts are well measured &amp; are in perfect sync with one another.

                            Dear Ms. Pakistan, Please keep in mind that across India only students from DU, JNU, CU, HU, LU and a little few others are politically motivated by the leftist and the socialist ideologies. Also, you must remember that all these universities don't represent "Entire India". So, Ms. Pakistan kindly do some research before you write something on our Indian newspapers.

No doubt the Hyd event is regretful but its fight bet two students. Irresponsible Media hyped it and made it a national issue. It is just a local police case. let police and vc of uni  handle it. Media made it an issue bet dalit and non-dalit and gave political twist. Campus violence is quite common. ppl like kejari,pappu and other oppostion are always ready get ignited and media watching fun. So dont add fuel to the fire. Today 3 girls commited suicide in Chennai blaming the admin. You can drag Modi also there. so stop Modi bashing.

                            the problem with Narendra Modi is not lack of efficiency but his back-up the RSS and their undue influence on the goings 0n. He goes around the whole world selling India like a salesman with effects flowing in in a trickle so far.  But the people who are at home are doing their best to ensure that he is reined in  and he is hindered at every step. It is a Cross he has to bear since he belongs to the BJP.  But please do not put him on a par with that pampered mongrel from the congress who actually does not  know what he talks or does. I am no political animal but certain things have to be spoken out vehemently. Our only hope is that the impending rejig of the cabinet will bring out some true and honest workers instead of party hangers on.

                            It is always easy to see one side of the coin. Perhaps it is considered to be rather myopic. Ms. Rana, if you were the VC tell us what would have been your steps of action against the errant students creating nuisance in the campus whatever reason may be. It is not a question of enjoying liberty to express your voice, it is a responsibility of the students to understand that liberty carries responsibility and we must behave in a way as approved by the rules of institute. This is administrative step that before proceeding for any action against rulebreaker scholarship must be stopped. That is not salary, that is an assistance given for good academic performance and you have to sign some kind of declaration of good conduct. You can not do both, enjoy scholarship from the state and abuse at the same time. Yes, going against the verdict of SC, that too after an unprecedented hearing and President of India is absuse to a nation and a student can not do it. No one should take his life himself. This is unfortunate and unethical too. But it is equally unethical to make such death a political issue. Further, if you can do politics be bold to face any adversaries. Or remain goody goody and do the primary duty as student. Ideology of people may be different and it should be but within acadenia you are not allowed to ceate a bad atmosphere. The political parties want to say that whatever a dalit does you donot dare to touch him. Had university taken any disciplinary action against any non-dalit it would have fine with you all. Right? So people like you are just become partisan. Pathetic really.

                            The people agitating are not the real representatives of student folk but they are the one instigated by the Naxal group (I am talking about Hyderabad incident only) to defame the Government.<br/><br/>
I believe, even rohith death is not caused by suicide, it is believed that it could be a murder by certain group to rake up issues. This is the naxal strategy.

                            "student dissent" is not when youth gangs under pretext of student democracy use violence on university campuses!! What happened is unfortunate. But let's not allow emotions and logic to get mixed up. A group of students were suspended due to assault on another student from a different party. Such intolerant politics is a reality in universities across India. Not one commentator seems to be able to deal with this fact!

                            I am appalled by this piece of Ms. Ayub who compares Rahul Gandhi and Modi  Govt. this is in no defence of Congress Party but it is difficult to match the nadir that BJP Govt. has reached. No where was Rahul Gandhi or his government directly involved in the crisis. In Vemula's case, The HRD ministry wrote 4-5 letters to the University to take action against the students involved in the tiff with the ABVP.  <br/>
Efforts were made by Ms. Sheila Dikshit and Rahul Gandhi to talk after public came to street but they were booed away. Has any effort been made by Modi government to do the same except a one liner thrown by the Prime Minister when there was sloganeering against him in Lucknow. Ms. Ayub may be right to an extent but her comparison this time is wrong. One is taken by surprise to see this comparison when Congress is not even in State. Hope Ms. Ayub does not have a grudge to grind.

                            Glad someone in the media  has at last recognised that the Congress 'youth icon', Rahul at 45, and his party, have completely failed the youth of the country and the latter have no use for them. But just ask any Congressman if he agrees. For the Congress, blissful ignorance, induced by arrogant smugness, is the key word when it comes to learning lessons. But this is as it should be. Otherwise, we may have another concoction called UPA, led by Rahul Baba this time, to contend with, God forbid !

                            the poor fellow committed suicide- actually the easy way out. Having said that , let us admit that there may be a million reasons for it including the fact that he is himself a weak guy unable to face the world boldly or perhaps disillusioned.whatever may be the reason, the matter has taken a political color and all politicians  have taken advantage and are running it for "their own selfish ends".In the case of the student at IIT Chennai, it has been brought out that he did have a love affair in which he was the loser.His death had nothing to do with his Dalit status nor discrimination. So the moral is that what is required is a total mental makeover and not accusations on either side. It seems this Dalit problem is worse than the White-Black problem in the USA. but the difference is that the leaders of both communities there  are sane enough and trying hard to smooth out the lines while in India they are trying their best to emphasize the differences and create more  bitterness. And the criminal part is that these 'dalits' in their anxiety  are 'converting to other religions who are waiting in the wings in their numbers' game for action. the best part of all this hullabloo is that it is not the "high castes'  but the alphabet castes who create all problems against the Dalits because they are fighting for their 'quota' for the small windows of opportunity in our country and hence it is an "economic"  fight and not  caste as such.  and worse the leaders do not realize it. or pretend not to.
