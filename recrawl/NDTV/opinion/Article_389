Headline::::Dear Delhi by Arvind Kejriwal



DateTime::::2015-02-01T04:06:00+05:30



(Arvind Kejriwal is former Chief Minister of Delhi and Convener of the Aam Aadmi Party.)
	About a year ago, thousands of young men and women in Delhi began something they had not done before. They sat around dinner tables, discussing and debating politics with their family members. People in Delhi have always debated politics, but this time it was different. This time they stuck their necks out- vouching for a new political party, often writing out cheques with their hard-earned money.
	A few months later, this very group had to face the embarrassment of hearing friends and loved ones say: "See, we told you so." Many people across Delhi feel that our actions have let them down. In May this year,we apologised to the people of Delhi for  the disappointment caused; and in case you missed it the first time, I do so again - so you hear us loud and clear.
	AAP was a breath of fresh air with clean funding and the promise of clean and sincere governance. We did not lie, and we did not steal. However, I acknowledge that people were still hurt by our actions, because what AAP represents is bigger than all of us. People felt hurt that they invested so much of themselves in a party and movement that was seen to have walked away.
	It's also a commonly-held belief that I gave up the Chief Minister's chair in Delhi to fight the Lok Sabha election and become Prime Minister. I didn't.I requested a fresh election for Delhi the very moment I resigned. Inspite of being a minority government, our approval ratings were 71%. But the Delhi election never came. In hindsight, perhaps we were too trusting. It was a mistake, an honest mistake; but a mistake all the same. Fortunately, the windscreen is greater than the rear view mirror. After all, if the people give us the full mandate to govern, they will rightly expect us to lead with patience and savvy. As someone recently said, it's what we can do as a party of Delhi for the people of Delhi that's important - we acknowledge this and we do take it very seriously.
	AAP means a lot of things to a lot of people. To some, it's a force that can combat cronyism and finally allow people to do business. To others, it represents a change from communal and sectarian ideologies. To most, it's a chance to enjoy the rights, freedoms, and safeguards that our constitution bestows upon us. We took the opportunity to represent some of these broader issues in the last election: the right to do business without hafta, and the need to protect the country from open theft of precious national resources.
	We all want the same things: a stable and responsive government, a bribe-free business climate, the chance to make an honest living, to see one's children have a better life, and finally, the simple assurance that we are safe and secure.
	AAP or no AAP, Kejriwal or no Kejriwal, these are ideals that we all cherish. These are ideals that will never lose steam. AAP has survived many challenges and surmounted great obstacles because we have worked as a team and as a family. This family cuts across all economic and social boundaries. We are the people of Delhi, we understand how to solve its problems, and we understand that the people of this city want to feel like their government works for them.
	We understand the people want us to work constructively with the central government. We understand Delhi's government must be both honest and stable, a government ready on Day One to build a globally-competitive Delhi, a government that has its ear to the ground, in tune with the diverse needs of its people.
	Let us not underestimate our own power as people - our leaders exist to serve us. Let us not underestimate the power of a government that embraces its people, a government that trusts its people. Government shouldn't exist to lecture and instil fear and insecurity. Government exists to nurture growth and provide stability and security in the hope of a better tomorrow - to paraphrase Tagore: "where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls."
	We have a vision to turn Delhi into India's first bribe-free investment destination, a global hub for start-ups, services, and high-tech manufacturing. Delhi will set new standards in business growth, healthcare, education, and women's safety. This is not achievable overnight, but, with expert advice, clean intentions, and a commitment to work together - even with people that disagree with us - it is where we start. The reality is that whatever our differences, we are all in this together. We can achieve this step by step. Let's come together once again in Delhi.
	As I seek your blessings in the coming election, please know that I believe stability first starts within, by staying the course, and being honest with the people you hope to serve. Taking lessons from the past only strengthens our ability to deliver on our vision of a truly world-class city. We look ahead with clear eyes and full hearts, filled with a sense of purpose, ready for the task at hand.
	Before I end, I want to express my deep gratitude for the kindness and support you have shown to the thousands of volunteers who continue to put  their busy lives aside. They come seeking to convince people that it is possible for a party of the city to win an election with clean funding. Not a day goes by where I am not grateful to you for continuing to open your homes to us and for giving us your thoughts and blessings.
	We often tell young people they are the leaders of tomorrow, but I disagree.
	Their strength is needed in India today. They are here right now, as we are. It's our burden to bear; it's our responsibility to share. Our time is now.
	Finally, I can promise you the following: I will not quit. Period.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            I know that Arvind Kejriwal and AAP did few strategic mistakes last year and also everyone may not fully agree with their methods. But nobody can question their intent. They deserve the credit for getting the country engaged in political discussions, forcing big traditional parties to amend their ways and proving elections can be funded honestly and won on white money by aam aadmi like me and you.<br/><br/>
It's very important to give them a chance of full 5 year term. This will allow us to watch both Modi and Kejriwal to see their performance over a period of time and then we can can judge them. Both are beacons of hope and both deserve a full 5 year term to be fairly judged.<br/><br/>
If Arvind doesn't deliver in next 5 years, we all can back to our inherent cynicism against politics. But just imagine what if he succeeds. That will change the entire political discourse.

                            These free flowing and free words from the heart are more precious and genuine than the expensive, calculated &amp; boringly repetitive style of 'buy out bhakths with the money power, spread them around to fool people, land in a chopper with a 10 lakh suit, make some noise, try to fool as many as you can, take off' from our Baashan man. Kallu mama needs to come up with a some newer dirty game. Sorry to being so negative but its just the frustration of  BJP being just another Congress version. Go on AK Sir. Work your heart out.  We are with you.

But it is your forray into politics that is very exciting and promising. <br/><br/>
You are entrusted with trust of many indians to change "babu" culture that has kept india in 80s. You &amp; your team are hero. <br/><br/>
Wish you a win !!

                            Kejriwal is absolutely correct. His team is one with passion and have real intentions to do something for the people of Delhi. And all that is possible only if he gets an absolute majority, else he has to compromise for demands from the ones he starts aligning with. Look at what happened to UPA, major part of damage was done by its allies. Now look at J&amp;K, why cant anyone form a govt. As such BJP is a big brother in the politirics there and they too cannot even figure out a formula with the rest of the aspirants, in the last 3 months. Then how can you even think of a party like AAP head an alliance with others. They will need to compromise for each and everything. Finally my humble suggestion is people of Delhi should give AAP another chance with full majority so that they can deliver on their promises. (I can bet you if they need something for the larger interest of Delhi, they will make sure they get it from Center by whatever means.) At the end of the day what is needed is the passion and more of a startup mindset to get things done, which is not their in BJP or Cong (as they have grown to become large corporates and all of us know what motivates corpartes to keep going, market share, revenues, bottom line, egos etc)

                            modi ji looks like Wolf in the mask of sheep. just like we only hear deafning silence in last 8 months in terms of black money etc. people of delhi will hear the same silence on the hollow promises made by modi/bedi becasue bedi has no clue whatsoever of delhis real issues as she is new and modi's life is too good for such petty issues.  Kiran bedi is clean image and straight forward and that makes her a misfit in delhi BJP looking at the heina's around her. due to her lack of flexibility if she cant fit in AAP, she will never be able to survive BJP even if she becomes CM. on the other hand our kejru bhai has learnt his lesson the difficult way and he is hungry to prove a point to the people of delhi and definitely deserves a second chance. go aap go… "apki baar modi hai bahar"

Yogendra Yadav came across as intellectual , which he no doubt is.<br/><br/>
For future of India , Arvind Kejriwal has to win &amp; stay in power as CM. <br/>
In next 5/10 years he would be prepared for Prime Minister of India.

                            I was angry when he resigned - but to be honest I think I knew that this was the exact reason he resigned...but did not see any mal-intent there...it was just embarrasing that a party we trusted so much would resign - it was just wrong...<br/><br/>
this apology does not help as such but I think I can even think about voting for BJP as they are far away in majority as AAP has managed to convince most that they are the right choice. and congres??? thats s mistake I would never do..<br/><br/>
so yes I am still angry with AAP, and I do believe Arvids letter at the same time - but I am not voting for them because they said 'sorry' but because I think they have a better vision and intent. I cant bear Bedi as my CM - IMPOSSIBLE she is the Lady version of Rahul Gandhi

                            If AAP comes to power it is going to be same for Delhi as before, when it was in power. That is let us create anarchy and be proud of it. Not follow the law of the land and mislead people. Blame everyone that is the Union Government the police the opposition parties, the Governor and even the press. Flip Flops will be there from AAP, and every action would be to gain sympathy from public. <br/><br/>
What has been of those people who were advised to not pay electricity bills and make sting videos off corrupt people. They were left in lurch.<br/><br/>
Kejriwal's last government was with congress backing, and see what were his statements then, that " BJP can take support of corrupt congress, we will never" and then he goes and takes their support. <br/><br/>
Should we have this type of a person as CM?

                            Dear Arvindji, We all know that how you have come to politics and your vision to this great country. There is nothing wrong in resignation. As you thought that it is not advisable to compromise on "Principles", every honest man will do the same thing. In fact the people of this country have greater faith on you, more than what we had earlier. We know your "INTENTION". When the intention is good....no body can win you. And you have crores of good, simple, humble common man is behind you. Go ahead with your mission. No body can stop you. Because you are the voice of Millions of common man. We are always with you.

                            Dear Sir, we appreciate u taking this route and nobody doubts ur integrity. What we have a problem with is ur method when something goes against ur wishes. We don't see u as a true democratic person. Take any example, be it a politician, ur own colleagues, media, constitutional bodies. U don't see problem in violating rules when it suits u. U don't like answering questions but love to ask them at will. I really want you to succeed in the long run and hence wanna test and give an opportunity as the main opposition party. I think your party and cadre is not that matured. While we love their zeal and agility, we expect a sense of responsibility. Would love to see u keep the govt on their toes and play a responsible opposition. During this process u will not only cultivate ur political skills but will also know who are your true friends and ur cadre will also achieve some maturity. As they say in Hindi, khara sona bhatti me jal kar Aur nikharta hai. U r a diamond and AAP is sona. Good luck and best wishes......!!!!!

                            AAP is an experiment with a noble intent and thereby makes it worthy for an unconditional support for some more time. It may be recalled that Lokpal bill was pending in Parliament for more that 45 years in spite of many protests, demands, hunger strikes etc. The political establishment was simply not willing to listen, because they  knew the danger of a powerful Lokpal. They were thrown out of their inertia and compelled to pass the bill, albeit a softer version, just because of the massive shock they received after seeing the  result of Delhi election last time. Here was a party, less than 1 year, successfully taking on the political Golliaths on the plank of anti corruption. Their idealism may not become a reality, but if they can force some course correction, what is the harm ?
