Headline::::The Inevitability of the Kejriwal Cult

(Aunindyo Chakravarty is senior managing editor, NDTV India and NDTV Profit)
	Such was the fear of Josef Vissarionovich Djugashvili, that three years after his death, at the 20th party congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Nikita Krushchev could still not name him when he spoke of the "cult of personality" that had overtaken the USSR under Djugashvilli, popularly known as JV Stalin.
	The concept of the Cult of Personality is, of course, older than that, but it is Kruschev's usage that is believed to have made it popular. Since then, it has been used to describe many political leaders, whose larger-than-life personas have overshadowed their organisations.
	Ironically, it is political parties themselves who often create and foster these personality cults to sway voters, organise them behind a charismatic leader and use that to win elections. This is especially true of American Presidential elections, but we have all seen this happen across the world.
	Personality cults have become even more effective in our age, dominated and "produced" by TV news and social media. Times of economic crises also become fertile ground for the rise of such personalities, who appear as heroes and saviours.
	In the past five years, we have seen it happen with at least three people - Anna Hazare, Narendra Modi and Arvind Kejriwal. In each of these cases a movement or a party has got identified with the larger-than-life figure of an individual.
	The Aam Aadmi Party has been the latest - and perhaps greatest - beneficiary of the politics of the Cult of Personality. Despite being a movement of volunteers, of ordinary citizens, it has sold itself in the recent elections through one man. Its slogan Paanch Saal Kejriwal and the catchy marketing jingle Maange Dilli Dil Se, Kejriwal Dil Se were both centred around the carefully cultivated persona of Arvind Kejriwal as an everyday hero.
	Both Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan, who have now raised the issue of the growing Kejriwal cult in AAP, were party to this electioneering strategy. In fact, on Tuesday when I asked Prashant Bhushan whether it was right to project Kejriwal instead of the party, he admitted that these things have to be done during an election campaign.
	I found Prashant Bhushan's belief that things will then come back to normal after the elections, where the Cult of Personality will suddenly be replaced by complete inner party democracy, a little too utopian. In politics there is no such magic personality cult switch that you can switch on when you want to win an election, and then switch off when you want to have your say.   (Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            the difference between modi cult and kejriwal cult is that modi cult is backed by 15 yrs of solid deliverables in Gujarat whereas kejriwal cult has no such backing credentials. The only thing kejriwal has got is rhetoric, drama and dharnas. He ran away in 49 days during his first term and now, in view of his own party men are rebelling openly against him, he has run away on medical leave.

                            "Why AAP projecting AK as CM candidate?" That was on question I posted on multiple forums on internet. How a party with collective leadership projects one person as CM candidate? There was all round hysteria to make AK as an alternative. The hysteria should had been around AAP and not AK.

                            Real issue is not the leader himself, but the coterie he builds around him. Those included feel good. Those who are out of the inner group complain about it. A leader should make sure that he takes all sections of people and give them their due.

                            When AAP was at its peak in 2011 and Anna Hazare left it in the lurch for no apparent reasons and when Kiren Bedi was usurped by the BJP, the waves took AK to great heights.  Where were all the other pillars of AAP them?  They should have taken care to ensure that no one leader was allowed to gain popularity at the cost of the AAP.  Now, it is too late to make amends because the party has been taken over by vested interests.  Unless some drastic steps are taken to save the party in true spirit of democracy, the party will whither away.  Sharks are on the prowl.

                            First to help Sonia-Rahul-Priyanka Congress with tacit Understanding with the same Congress during december 2013 Elections created an image for AK. Their Illusion then was that he would divide BJP VOtes in Delhi paving th eway for Congress Return.But AAP split Congress Votes and AAP got 28 Seats BJP 31 and Congress 8. Then English Media saw in AK a Person who could defeat Narendra Modi.From December 9th AK became PM Candidate. How Money cam e we do not know.AAP contested 450 LOksbaha seats or so. AK defeated the 3 Time  Delhi CM Mrs Sheela Dixith . So English media intoxicated AK. H ekicked off Delhi CM Post and became DrJump.Contested against Narendra Modi.The Rest need not be told.With that AL learnt a Lesson and ha ssaid that he will concentrate on Delhi Assembly Elections 2015. Hedid the same.. NOw Congress has become nonentity.Narendra Modi's successive victories baffled Congress,Other Secular Parties and more than them English media. They made AK a Superman. BJP's mistakes added to his victory.H egot 67 Assembly Seats BJP 3 Congress 0.. All thes esections became  Jubilant and  sang Panegyrics on AK. Yesterday Aravind Kejriwal is only a Piece of Lint.TOday he has become an Iron Screw for the sam epeople. Narendra Modi,s Cas eis different.H ewas the CM for 13 Years.H estood firmly to his Ideology,Developed Gujarat. Hefaced the onslaught by Congress . Secular Parties,English Media ,HR Groups ,Social Activists and so on.People of india wanted  a Strong and Selfless PM.. ..

                            The cult of personality? This is a nation of saints and incarnations. worshipped by millions. This man has sacrificed everything for the people, given potency to a multitude of social activists and now it trying to lead them. If some people are unhappy or demand something in return for their time and resources spent, they can leave or stay and learn.

                            I'm deeply saddened and disillusioned at the outcome of AAP's PAC, particularly pained by Arvind skipping it and still orchestrating the ouster. I personally felt that Arvind's decision to contest against Modi at best be termed as being over ambitious and hasty and that too at hindsight and the word 'Bhagoda' was more of a BJP's strategy to tarnish Arvind. However now I truly feel that it was indeed a 'Bhagoda' who rather than confronting his critics from within his own party and resolving the differences, chose to dump them. It would have been gracious for him to have attended the PAC even if the outcome was no different. By staying away he is neck deep in the controversy and his tweet refusing to be drawn into this is nothing but farce.  I still refuse to lose hope and continue to pray for AAP.

                            Modi cult has an entire organisation and an ideology and the switch is at Nagpur to one or off, so it is controlled as per the requirement.  Kejriwal cult has no direction, it is a fluke win.  Only time will tell.

                            @vidyasagar: Gujrat was already a developed state. Lalbhai group biggest denim manufacturer, Diamond industry, pharma industry and Amul existed before Modi became CM.<br/>
Modi nothing but good salesman, sold it to entire country and became PM.<br/><br/>
why GDP growth rate is stand still, why inflation except fuel ,still increasing?<br/><br/>
you are also victim of Modi cult.<br/><br/>
no one can avoid personality cult. it just happens. among thousand of singers, few voices are liked, among thousand of actors few are loved. it happens.
