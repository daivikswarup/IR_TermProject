Headline::::Rahul Gandhi is Cancerous for the Congress



DateTime::::2015-02-25T17:40:00+05:30



(Suhel Seth is Managing Partner of Counselage: India's only strategic brand advisory.)
	It is ironic: Rahul Gandhi is missed when he is actually missing.
	When he is around, no one seems to care, so probably one reason for him having gone away is to perhaps be missed. But the truth of the matter is he is being missed in a delightful way. And the blokes in his party aren't helping matters either.
	Bangkok is a haven for bachelors. Especially those who have nothing. So when someone told me Rahul has gone to Bangkok, I was not surprised. Bangkok is the city of Happy Endings too, and here please don't take assume sexual innuendos. It is a city where you can buy anything. Without being someone. There is no accountability, no piercing questions of a parliamentary nature, and what's more, no prying eyes. Bangkok gives you the anonymity that a TV studio in India will never give you.
	Also Bangkok is a pilgrimage for both food and requisitioned love and let's hope Rahul gets enough of both.
	Then there is the issue of Uttarakhand and Rahul being alone in some tent or that's what the papers tell us courtesy some lad called Jagdish Sharma. But then this is where the comedy of errors begins. Why on earth would someone make a case for leave of absence in a country like India, and that too during the Budget Session? Why on earth would that individual come across as a nervous school-boy who is hell-bent on missing the first day at school because he knows not what to expect? What kind of leader leaves his flock to fend for themselves just as they've emerged from a traumatic period (read Delhi elections). Why would a young man like Rahul Gandhi, who shows unsolicited aggression at the worst of times, behave like Arvind Kejriwal once did? Scoot to avoid the heat.
	I have never understood Rahul Gandhi. And I am not alone. He must have enough reasons for his behaviour, but that behaviour is abnormal in the Indian context. On the one hand you have a Prime Minister who is in-your-face on a daily basis, and wears more than just his own name on his sleeves, and on the other, you have Rahul Gandhi, who is happy just folding his sleeves. It is almost as if you have a reluctant sulker running the Congress party with a distressed mother because she doesn't know what to do with her maverick son.
	Add to that the complete idiocy of the Congress Party and their constant stumbling from one error to another. But then to blame just the party would be a tad unfair. You have a leadership that is astray and that has lost both the will and confidence. This is not a political party anymore. Congress is more like a dishevelled amoeba. And that will not help matters.
	The Party needs to come clean on what Rahul is thinking because the Party always behaves like Rahul is the owner. When the owner is missing at the till, there is bound to be confusion and conjecture. And in this environment, the real agenda always gets hijacked. I will not ever say that the Congress is dead, but I will make the case that Rahul Gandhi is cancerous for the Congress. Or for that matter, for any movement that requires one to lead and instill confidence in the troops. He belongs more to The Dead Poet's Society than to the Grand Party. And it is not about where he is missing. It is only about why is he missing when he shouldn't be. The latter is also symbolic of Rahul's maturity and seriousness and in the present context he is more Wordsworth and less Nehru. More the Wanderer and less the Statesman.
	Come back, Rahul. All is forgiven.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            For all said and done, Rahul has repeatedely tried to wean the Congress party's dependence on the Gandy family.  Time and again he has pointed out that leadership should come from grassroot level. His political skills may not be the best but he does seem to a little honest for what the Congress party.  On a personal level, I hope to see he has a fulfulling life devoid of the need to be encumbered with the unfulfilling burden of reviving a moribund party.  Happy holidays Rahul!

                            Rahul is also the twit who does not realise that people are laughing at him rather than with him.  He is the Shahzade who is regarded as below the standards of his Mummy and Sister.  Sadly for him and happily for the rest of the country, Rahul has no shortage of aggressive, sarcastic and boorish supporters such as Aiyar,Ramesh, Diggy, Jha, Tiwari, Singhvi, Renuka, Soni, Scindia, Surjewala, Pilot et all to be his apologists for him.  The rest of the nation has seen right through this.  India now has free people who will not accept that a person is more entitled than them to lead the nation merely by reason of his birth into that dreadful parivar that has colonised India post the British exiting.

                            all this appears to be as per a script..queen has come to now that rank and file think that so long as yuvraj is at the helm, party has no future. being a dynasty icon, cannot show the door unceremoniously.hence sabbatical. queen will take over now. and being an expert in realpolitik will forge alliance with like minded parties and challenge the present dispensation at appropriate time with full support and connivance of MSM who anyway are greatly upset with the loss of importance under current regime.When things turn around yuvraj may resurface as claimant for the throne.

                            "When he is around, no one seems to care."  Suhel saab, your assessment is perfect. No one seems to care when he is around because he is totally irrelevant to any issue in our country. He speaks big, but is total zero when it comes to action. So he is irrelevant. People speak about him when he is not around because we are curious about his intentions. If he wishes to quit Indian politics altogether, there would be celebrations across the whole of India. So, you are damn right!

                            Rahul gandhi has thorough professionals in his team. He has "Dig" vijay to dig the congress party's grave. Ran "deep" surjewala to make sure the grave is "deep." These two, along with their assistants, mani shankar iyer, manish tiwari, sanjay jha, ambika soni, alok kumar, salmon "afsoz", etc., are handful to sink the congress party and all these individuals has been very successful at that! The last thing would be Mr. Kamal Nath, the most successful professional politician in congress party to lay a "kamal" on the congress party's coffin.

                            In context of company sarkar versus farmers Rahul is on the wrong side for company dalals like this suhel seth. Wake up sheeple or else Modi's company sarkar will end up selling your country to few rich people and enslave your future generations. Do not let your grudge against muslims sell your children's future to rich corporates. He may have many faults, but I respect Rahul for his pro farmer, pro poor work.

He had to come up throw so much opposition within his own party, win election for the party and then become PM. Here we have a failure after failure and his party is pleading him to take over, congressmen are defending as if going on introspection is the best thing he could do etc. I don't think congress has learnt any lessons and still dancing around this useless family.

                            If he is upset with his mom and the old time congi leeches why can Rahul start his own party, that will disprove his critics wrong and he may get more votes than the congis. That would be abetter option than becoming congi president too. As I am sick of the congi leeches who have sucked the blood out of India. Heard the self serving interviews of two old timers of the dynastic party yesterday - now clamoring for Rahul basically for their own survival.

But having all the authority without any accountability seems to run in their veins.

                            Brilliant ! So here we have a PM who is in his sixties and works for 18 hours a day. And here we have a person who was once projected for that job (or at least a good leader of opposition) who skips the class and goes on a trek. I wonder how do Congtress party workers, the original aam aadmi's feel about this holiday.

                            May be it is a good thing for the Congress. May be the Congress commoners can finally introspect without distractions - search for an able leader from within. Aah, who am I fooling. That shall not ever happen. Congress is dispirited. Its non-Gandhi family leaders are in deep comatose and doomed in denial in forever infatuations of the Nehru Family. There is little hope for anything new in Congress, its in suspended animation. There will be odd huddles in the CWC, a bit of hue and cry in the parliament or the TV at Primetime - and that's it. Congress' bane is the dispirit in its senior leaders and lack of inspirational polity. Good for Mr. Gandhi, hope this vacation serves him right on a personal level.

                            So much interest in RG, means he has made the point. Nation is looking at him with curiosity. Future is going to be fractured mandate, BJP and Congress both will be marginalised for their deeds. Parties like AAP and regional parties will become stronger. He should declare that he will never become PM and see the wind turning to his side. Congress will benefit from such declarations.

                            Unfortunately, the CONGRESS cannot gain respectability as long they continue to hold on to losers. Nature does not. Change is inevitable and respect for failure WILL ensure further failure as they have no more messages to give or changes to deliver. GET MOVING and replace all the oldies.

                            One may say this is Rahul Gandhi's moment of truth.

                            This comes from a brand strategist who , for I know may have been the pone who suggestd that Modi wear that darn egoistic dress. He has been swinging the BJP way for 3 years and seems to be revelling on the job. I have a simple question: why the hell is so much brouhaha over RG not telling anyone? Nahin bataana. Cleearly the media cannot be privy to where each MP holidays, parties, mates ?? or do they? buzz off. seriously.
