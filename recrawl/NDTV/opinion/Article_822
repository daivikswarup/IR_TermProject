Headline::::My Request as a Mother



DateTime::::2015-09-10T17:17:00+05:30




                                On August 19, 2015, I stood outside the Supreme Court of India, distraught and bereft of hope, tears streaming down my face as I spoke to the media. I had just been robbed of my only hope to find justice for the killing of my children Ujjwal and Unnati who had perished in the fire at Uphaar Cinema, New Delhi on June 13, 1997.
Suffering with me were 28 families who had lost a total of 59 loved ones in the same fire. From 1997 to 2015, we believed the judicial system in the country would help us get justice. Our belief was strengthened when the owners of Uphaar Cinema, Sushil and Gopal Ansal were convicted and sentenced to jail in 2014 by the Supreme Court.
However, since the two-judge bench could not come to a unanimous decision on the quantum of sentence, the matter was referred to a three-judge bench. We had waited for 17 years for the verdict, so at this point a further delay did not surprise us or shock us. But what has shocked us, and I believe several others in the country, was the verdict which was delivered on August 19, 2015.
The Ansal brothers were permitted to walk free without serving any time in jail if they paid a penalty of 30 crores each. They were permitted to buy 59 lives including those of my children for 60 crores. The penalty was to be paid to the Delhi Government for a trauma center, which already existed.
 
Please join me and members of the families of the victims to protest against this injustice on September 12, 2015 at 5 pm at Jantar Mantar as we protest peacefully and hold a candlelight vigil for our loved ones. Help us make this city safer for your children and loved ones.

                            Third world country, fourth class judiciary. Money buys everything.

                            My request as a human. Forgive and forget. Indian courts are pathetic - it wouldn't spit on us if we were on fire.

                            Some of these judgements are incomprehensible. In the 1984 Bhopal Gas Tragedy about 3000 people were killed by the criminal negligence of the then Union Carbide Co. The CEO of Union Carbide, (late) Mr Warren Anderson  was flown out of the city in the official aircraft of the M.P. government. The jail term awarded to the head of the Indian subsidiary was 1 year simple imprisonment. My deepest sympathies to the victims and their families.

                            Salute your resolve, Neelam.  I saw in your tears on the day of the verdict,faces of many voiceless victims of such callous attitude of people governing us. This country of late is directed to some semblance of governance through court verdicts. However this one was disappointing. Support to you always.

                            The piling number of pending cases in the Indian judiciary is legendary, estimates saying it would take 320 years to clear the backlog of 31.28 million cases pending in various courts across the country. We are by your side

                            What you have loss, it is permanent and painful for whole life and nobody can replace it. However, it would have been different case if somebody might have done it intentionally and you fail to get justice. Accidents happens everywhere and mostly 99% due to human error, today somebody is there and tomorrow may be your dear one. Already you have gone through too much stress and anguish for so many years; it is not wise to stretch it too much.

                            In a speech Subramniam Swamy has stated that when case of Sonia Gandhi's educational qualification came for hearing SC judge had asked Swamy to be gracious and not insist on pursuing the case. If this is true we have to believe the SC is on the side of rich and powerful only.
