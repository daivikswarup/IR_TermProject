Headline::::So This Is What We Gained From Afzal Guru's Hanging



DateTime::::2016-01-12T23:09:00+05:30




                                The hangings of Ajmal Kasab and Afzal Guru within the space of a few weeks in 2012-13 were timed by the Manmohan Singh government to divert public attention from the political crises it was facing. The trick helped it barely for a week or so in each case - and exacted a huge price. Afzal Guru's hanging, in particular, was seen as a grave injustice in the Kashmir Valley. Many felt he was innocent. The unfortunate line in the Supreme Court judgement - "satisfying the collective conscience" - assured people that it wasn't justice that this was about.
Guru's hanging was pending for so many years (seven) that BJP veteran LK Advani contested the 2009 general elections on the issue, pitching it as an example of the Congress being soft on terrorism, allegedly for minority appeasement. Eventually, it seemed Afzal Guru's life ended not for his crimes - and I am not contesting his role in those - but to alleviate the daily tamasha of Indian politics.
Now that the terrorists in Pathankot and Mazari-i-Sharif in Afghanistan have made it clear that they wanted revenge in particular for the execution of Afzal Guru, would the Congress and the BJP like to reflect on the politics of capital punishment? Will they ask themselves whether hanging terrorists is the best thing to do in national interest?
It made matters worse that prison authorities didn't even inform Afzal Guru's lawyer or family before hanging him, didn't let him have a last meeting with his wife and son, and refused to give his family his mortal remains. Leave alone giving fodder to terrorists in Pakistan, we didn't even care about further alienating Kashmiris from India.
The terrorists in Pathankot told Rajesh Verma, the jeweler who was abducted from Superintendent of Police Salvinder Singh's car, that they had come to take revenge for Ajmal Kasab and Afzal Guru's hanging.
Indian intelligence agencies say the terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed, based in Pakistan, has created a squad named after Afzal Guru.
An audio clip posted online reportedly by the Jaish-e-Mohammed mocking how poorly India handled the Pathankot attack, eulogized Afzal Guru. Phone intercepts made by Indian intelligence revealed that the Jaish-e-Mohammad has vowed to carry out more terror attacks in India to take revenge for the 13 years Afzal Guru spent in jail.
In the attack on the Indian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan, also suspected by India to have been carried out by the JeM, the terrorists wrote in blood - "Revenge for Afzal Guru."
This has been given no consideration by the BJP and the Congress, but these news reports have also brooked no reflection in India on the politics of capital punishment. As someone opposed to death penalty in principle, with no exceptions, I had opposed the hanging of both Ajmal Kasab and Afzal Guru. From time to time, my online critics dig out my supposedly gory past in asking for "mercy" for these terrorists. In opposing the death penalty for them, I had argued that hanging terrorists creates easy martyrs for terror groups to incite more people to join their ranks, carry out more terror strikes.
When Kasab was hanged, former RAW chief B Raman had warned against revenge attacks. It is our unfortunate habit to not learn from history. The hanging of Kashmiri separatist Maqbool Bhat in 1984 became a major turning point in Kahsmir, catapulting his Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front to the forefront of militancy in 1989.
We think emotionally, and bloodthirsty calls for hanging terrorists take over the better part of our brains. With Afzal Guru's ghost haunting us, this is the time to rethink capital punishment. Violence begets violence. The emotional use of Afzal Guru by the Jaish-e-Mohammed is proof that it would be better to keep terrorists in jail for as long as the law wants, even till their natural death.
There is the hijacking argument. What if there's a hijack to secure the release of these terrorists, as was the case with the IC 814 hijack that led to the release of Maulana Masood Azhar, today the chief of the Jaish-e-Mohammed? But this isn't a good enough reason to hang people. The answer to hostage situations is for India to enshrine in law that it won't negotiate with terrorists, as is the practice in the United States. When terrorists know that hijacking isn't going to help bring their friends forth from jail, they would likely be discouraged from using it as a strategy.
Instead, India is planning to enact a new anti-hijacking law that will increase the scope for giving death penalty. I am sure this will deter terrorists who are prepared to die anyway. We like to capture terrorists and feel great about giving them what they want, martyrdom, which creates more terrorists.
Of course, the Jaish-e-Mohammed is cynically using Afzal Guru as an excuse. The idea is to show how India treats Kashmiris. But even if it is just an excuse, why give them the excuse?(Shivam Vij is a journalist in Delhi.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Why do you journalists opiniate on the topics of national security when you have little or no clue about it. In this article you undermined the Government of India, Supreme court and as well as the people of India. You feel(because you have space to write) that you know how to deal with terrorists better than the professional institutions of a country. I'll tell you a thing, go write about movies, leave national security with the right people with right mindset.

                            So according to author we should not punish terrorist fearing repercussions arising out of giving justice to innocent lives lost ?<br/><br/>
All terrorists should be meted out capital punishment because of the innocent people killed in their terrorist operation. They are testing our limits but the day will come when our army will go and kill them from their rat holes.

                            What a silly argument is this about hijack situations! You want law that doesn't allow negotiation with terrorists and when hijacking takes place you will be the first one to shout for the safety of the people hijacked and play politics over it. There is no point in keeping terrorists alive in jail as it will give opportunity to their groups to plan hijacking and try getting out their partners by putting pressure on government directly as well as through their sleeper cells - namely 5-star human right activists, left intellectuals, award wapsi authors, terrorist sympathizer journalists and media celebrities and finally the secular brigade of politicians.<br/>
Even if you don't punish terrorists with death penalty they will continue with their killings, so no need to be sympathetic to terrorists. Those who don't know the value of life don't deserve to be kept alive.

                            A stupid argument. Both Afzal Guru and Ajmal Kasab were terrorists who were tried under Indian law for crimes committed in India against Indians. They received the full benefit of the law that their victims did not. If some other terrorists come here to avenge their executions, they also needed to be killed which was duly done by the security forces. For foolish supporters of terrorists like this article's author, a quick referral to the psychiatric ward of a mental institution is an urgent necessity. NDTV should be very careful of the people it accepts opinion pieces from. This borders on treason.

                            Looking back it seems hanging of Afzal Guru(unlike Qasab) was too harsh, life-in-prison would have been a more just option. Qasab was himself the mass-killer, so his case is different.

                            Terrorists are not attacking our country &amp; killing our people because of capital punishment. And no, it's also not because we are hanging terrorists. It's because their holy book teaches them to kill kefir's. Kefir's are anyone who is not a muslim. <br/><br/>
ISIS flags in kashmir prove that kashmir stopped being about freedom from India long back. Today the Kashmir issue is about muslim majority neither wanting non-muslims in the state nor wanting to be under Hindu India. This is the fact. <br/><br/>
I am not sure if this post will get approved but this is the fact. We can fight terror only when we realise why ti's happening to us. We can do aman ki asha till eternity and it's not going to bring us peace. Let us understand that Islam is getting more violent and intolerant by the minute and that we will be attacked no matter what we do. Instead of trying to find peace with the muslim's of this world, lets fortify our defences.

                            Dear Mr. Shivam! In case the attack on Indian consulate in Kandhar and the Airforce base in Patuhankote was the result of Afzal Guru's hanging, can you kindly enlighten us what was the alibi for the terrorists to kill innocent civilians including a three month old child in Wandhma village in Kashmir some time back. How long can fool ourselves into believing that when they slap us, we should offer the other cheek to keep them in 'good homour' and be kind enough to spare us from the thousand cuts, which they believe should be inflicted on 'infidel' India. Common wake up and smell the coffee. According to Abraham Lincoln ' if there were no God, we would invent one'. On the same analogy if there was no Afzal guru hanging, the self appointed apostles of 'piety' and the proponents of medieval barbarian justice would have found some other excuse to get at our throats. Have no doubts about it.

                            No doubt, Afzal Guru's hanging was not handled properly by then Congress government. I do not think there was any approvals required from the terrorist to hang Ajmal Kassab. let JeM have hundreds of group named after every terrorist, that shouldn't deter our country to take stringent action against those who want to kill innocent people of my country.

                            This is the argument of chicken hearted.  We should design our policies to not to annoy the terrorists, otherwise they will attack us.  Instead, I propose we should make ourselves stronger and should not permit these people to come uninvited and harm anytime they feel like.  Look at Israel, how they have prepared themselves.  We should give out an unambiguous message that such activities will not be tolerated and we should demonstrate our strength.  Politicians and journalists should control themselves from being extra-humane.  We are not the only saviors of humanity.

                            Shivam Vij: Did you even bother to read the book which Afjal Guru wrote in Jail? He was a terrorist, who believed in armed jihaad against kafir. People like you completely destroyed the real meaning of "secular" and "liberal".

                            Mr. Bhat was hanged becoz of its acts.. why did he approve indian diplomat in UK ?? and his fellow follwers killed him; thts whn his clemecy was rejected... He also hijacked airline, arrested in pak on same charges... and released ... sneaked into india... there is a generation of people in kashmir who have no clue whts so ever about their history, origin etc.. all they know is whts been fed through pak, media, politicians and militants... till they make an effort for to come out of their shadows &amp; see reality nothing can be done...

                            Terrorism cannot be justified by any reason so even if these terrorists attacked India in the name of Afzal,does India have to bow down and fear terrorists before punishing them?This author seems to be more of a flash writer who does not weigh the words

                            What did i get from reading this article:<br/>
At the start of the article i did feel sense in the write up but towards the end he was like questioning everything... Did he mean that hanging of those 2 people were incorrect?<br/>
In INDIA If there a slightest PROOF that Afzal Guru was innocent he will not have received the death penalty... if there is proof there will be many and many to fight his case... this is my belief...<br/>
Having said that the his family was not able to meet him one final time is a heartening reality that should not have happened.<br/><br/>
its written above,<br/>
..The emotional use of Afzal Guru by the Jaish-e-Mohammed is proof that it would be better to keep terrorists in jail for as long as the law wants, even till their natural death....<br/><br/>
Sir are you serious when you wrote this!!!

                            Great idea Mr Vij ! Cowards who kill innocent civilians should be preserved and protected and fed 'Biryani at the cost of exchequer. Bloggers like Mr. Vij can gloss over in self-esteem by writing high flying prose, but i wish he had looked at the history and found out how this country has suffered over centuries at the hands of marauders for exhibiting the kind of meakness - the writer wants us to. Mr. Vij do you have the cheek to go and talk about your high morals to the family of Lt. Col Niranjan, who was killed a few days back. If not, please keep your great ideas to yourself and do not harm the resolve of this country to talk to terrorist in the only language they understand. Right?

And this money spent is at the cost of government investments in our primary education sector, healthcare, infrastructure....lets us tax money for the development of our country and not to spend on terrorist who are mass murderers

                            If it were not Afzal guru's hanging , it would be the demolition of Babri Masjid, or The persecution of Muslims in Myanmar, or Partition , or the creation of Bangladesh or some Danish cartoon or the calumny of the West, or the the prophet being maligned.<br/>
It seems Muslims needs little or no reason to create chaos and conflict all the time often times for decades !!.<br/>
And with many other bozos like Shivam Vij around as apologists to create stories &amp; conspiracies...i suppose the Holy war can go on forever.

                            Shivam you have raised very important points but you will targeted compromising on national security and concious. But where this concious evaporates when nothing happens on the killing of thousands? This leads to alienation nit only in Kashmir but many parts of the country. <br/>
The ruling elite has made this game for 68 years. This is the reason no leader except AAP goes out without the Z Security but the people gets divided and vulnerable. The vicious cycle goes on.

                            While India pats itself on the back as secular and tolerant country. Lot of issues it faces are also because it chose not to be a Hindu State or a modern Hindu state as per the rules of partition. Pakistan continues to have a temptation to weaken India and pockets of India where Hindus are not safe. India comes across as a soft state and Hindus as a soft target. Unless we get out of this mind-set, we continue to be vulnerable. Unfortunately state-craft does not necessarily reward nice people and nice nations. They respect only strength and readiness to use power.

We need to learn from Israel from this context to save the Sovernighty of the Country.  If your arguement is taken we dont require  Army . We can just keep silent on who ever attack us because we are afraid if we retaliate they might again attack us. Strongly condemn this type of approach.

From where did SC gauged the COLLECTIVE CONSCIENCE? From the number trolls on internet comments or twitter comments?<br/>
C'mon guys! If the SC uses the sentences such as 'COLLECTIVE CONSCIENCE' and 'COLLECTIVE BELIEF' [Aasta ka Vishay] or something to that effect in Babri/RJB verdict shows how our judiciary works. <br/>

                            During the State of the Union address Obama further said: "If you doubt America's commitment - or mine - to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden. Ask the leader of Al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell.  When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit." This is what India needs to do .. not not hang the  terrorists.

Seriously dude! You think you will shove your sickular agenda in the garb of your opposition to capital punishment and no one will notice? You are exposed. You are not only sickular, you are also a coward. It is our slow judicial system and crazy media that made Afzal Guru a martyr. He was proven a militant but it took so long and sold out media spinned it so well that made him an attractive figure for militants across the border. Let us say, his case has a strand of doubt but you have no shame in defending Ajmal Kasab as well! You are a pathetic spineless coward and shameless sickular.

In simple language he is opposing the idea of hanging the people and try to deradicalize the terrorists captured by Indian agencies. This is the way we can give the perfect answer to Hafeez Sayeed and Co. I agree with him but its require long transformation in our judicial system which is quite unlikely.
