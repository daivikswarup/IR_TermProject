Headline::::In Reactions to Aamir, Look Across the Border



DateTime::::2015-11-27T05:25:00+05:30




                                Aamir Khan's statement has created a furore; the over-reaction is not new, given the way an intolerant few have been reacting for the last few years. But a new dimension has been added which is rather dangerous. We have seen rationalists killed for their views, faces blackened, houses vandalized by lumpens of ideology, but to put pressure on Snapdeal for its association with Aamir is a new twist in the tale. This is a part of larger design to ostracize individuals, isolate them and force them to succumb to the bullies' ideology. This is rather more subtle than physical intimidation, but more effective in a democratic set-up.
Certainly I am not intimidated, but the whole debate reminds me about a sad journey which Pakistan has traversed since its inception, verging now on disintegration into a rogue society where liberalism-pluralism has no place. No doubt the Proponent of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, had mobilized Muslims in the name of Islam for a new sovereign territorial identity, but he was enlightened enough to realize the folly of his own ideological tool. It is no accident of history that after the creation of Pakistan, before the constituent assembly on 11 August, 1947, he said -"You may belong to any religion or caste or creed that has nothing to do with business of State .... we are starting with the fundamental principle that we are all citizens and equal citizens of one state ...now I think we should keep that in front of us as our goal and you will find that in course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus, Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the state."
This statement clearly shows that Jinnah was aware of the dangers of a theocratic state or a state which is run on the premise of religion. He was a modern man in the garb of a communalist. He knew Pakistan could not be left in the hands of clerics, Sharia could not be the law of the land, Islam couldn't be the only identity of the state. As Jaffrelot writes in his book The Pakistan Paradox, religion for him was an 'identity marker' for Muslims in India before independence. But Jinnah did not live long. His successors for years did try to follow his path to create a secular-plural society. It was for this reason that when a cry was raised to ostracize Ahmadis from Islam by fundamentalist forces, it was brutally suppressed by the Pakistan rulers in early 50s. Even a report was submitted to the Government, called the Munir Report, which refused to define Islam. "The report concluded that there was no specific definition of Islam, let alone of an Islamic constitution...And that the religious experts were best advised to leave the constitution making process alone." Mr Munir was then Chief Justice of Pakistan. And Maulana Maududi, proponent of Pakistan as an Islamic state, was sentenced to death by a military tribunal.
But the same Pakistan slipped into an abyss when the ruling elite started compromising with Islamic fundamentalists. This happens when leaders become pygmies who walk small. After the death of Jinnah and Liaquat Ali Khan, Pakistan fell in the hands of Khwaja Najmuddin, Ghulam Mohammad and Iskandar Mirza who were dwarfs with no vision and settled to make Pakistan, in its first constitution in 1956, an Islamic Republic of Pakistan; "only a Muslim could be the president and no law would be passed against the teachings of Quran." It was the beginning of the death of Jinnah's vision of Pakistan. General Ayub Khan tried to remove the word "Islamic'' in the name of Pakistan in the second constitution of Pakistan in 1962, but failed and had to reinstate it under pressure in 1963.
But the bigger undoing was by Z A Bhutto who was erroneously understood as progressive and modern. It was he who masked Islam in the garb of socialism. In fact, in my opinion, if one man who could be credited for the downfall of Pakistan, it was him. It was Bhutto who refused to concede power to Mujibur Rahman which finally resulted in the birth of Bangladesh; it was he who made "Islam as the state religion." Jaffrelot writes that "the third constitution of Pakistan in 1973 adopted that the freedom of expression was subject to the restrictions in the interest of the glory of Islam." It was Bhutto whose regime declared Ahmadis non-Muslim. The same Moududi who was jailed for the anti-Ahmadis agitation in early 50s felt victorious in the mid-70s, and saw to it that non-Muslims including Ahmadis become second class citizens in Pakistan, and that minorities were debarred from senior posts in government jobs. It was the death of Jinnah's Pakistan - a liberal, plural, secular Pakistan.
Experts blame Zia-ul-Haq for the Islamization of Pakistan, but the real culprit was the so-called modern socialist Bhutto. Zia was a conservative Muslim, under whose regime Dini Madaris grew exponentially; he subverted all the secular institutions, pursued jihadsim as a state policy in the context of the Afghan war which finally resulted in the birth of the Taliban, Al Qaida, Haqqani Network etc., and pushed the sectarian violence of the Shia-Sunni divide to unforeseen magnitude. Pakistan today is virtually fighting a civil war with Islamist forces and it has come this far that the Governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, was gunned down most brutally by his own body guard, who was showered with rose petals by advocates; no judge had the courage to hear his case and no advocate came forward to argue against him. And finally on December 16, 2014, more than a 100 children were slaughtered in the name of jihad in a school in Peshawar. And when the Army and Pakistan civil society claim to have woken up, it has become too late.
Today, when I look at the violent reactions against Aamir's statement, I am filled with dread. I am reminded of Pakistan. Our constitution makers dreamed of a secular-plural-liberal-modern-open-democratic society where we can live, breathe and debate openly without any semblance of fear, where we are not ostracized or killed because of our belief system or religion, because if that happens then it will the death of a dream that is India. Let's hope Modi does not become the Bhutto of India and Aamir does not have to think twice before uttering a word.

                            What the heck, this is seriously getting retarded. Aamir khan's statement was exaggerated and so was the reaction but Rana Ayyub and now this guy making comparison with Pakistan is just what is wrong with us. We over react for everything and we can't keep in our biases. These guys hate the government fair enough but please don't make my beloved country look bad because you hate the PM. Check the crime records etc and see the truth for yourselves.

                            Sir where did you start and where did you go.Why do you think anyone who opposes Aamir is a BJP stooge. I don't endorse BJP and I celebrated AAPs victory and I am hurt by Aamirs hypocrisy. Sadly AAP and AK are busy hugging or got hugged.So don't worry about the fabric of our country. It is strong and will remain as long as you guys don't label us to a group.Feel this is intolerance of yours

                            Its ironic that someone from AAP would worry about non-violent intimidation. When Kejriwal used to sit on incessant Dharnas, that didn't seem like the politics of intimidation? That suddenly becomes a fundamental right of yours?<br/><br/>
Ashutosh, it is one thing to be a hypocrite and quite another to be a shameless hypocrite.

                            You are a fool ashutosh. These are not bullys but the opinion of the silent majority who have not had a voice. Can't you see the majority did not vote for the same congress who only look out for their vote bank. Either we should feel and behave like the extension of the west or be growling at their feet in exchange for votes. You are soo wrong. At least we can now feel what we want to and not be sniggered by the establishment

                            How totally ignorant one can be huh, Ashutosh? If a huge majority of the people have a certain point of view, they are termed as "bullies" by you? The only bullies that I see are the very ones who are harping the tone of "intolerance" in the recent past. <br/><br/>
No one has denied Aamir of his Freedom of Speech. He came. He talked nonsense. And he left. But if he has a right to Freedom of Speech, so do people who do not agree with him. If they take up non-violent ways to protest a stance taken by Aamir, you should be proud rather than whine in this way. Just because a majority of the people do not concur with you, doesn't mean they are "intolerant". Intolerant are those who refuse to pay heed to the protests of people over his irresponsible statements and, not only that, have the audacity of calling the protesters intolerant. It is clear that it is Aamir Khan who is intolerant and has no respect for Freedom of Speech - such an irony.

                            Only one question? while you want pluralism in India,why are you afraid of open debate. Amir has made a point and protested and thousands are protesting and asking question to him. Why we need to suppress that voice ?isn't it the same fascism being practiced which we are so afraid of. In the interview, Amir told something really nice, that if protest is not violent, all protests are OK. If somebody  (May be a whole bunch of people) doesn't believe in what you believe makes him different but not evil. By no logic, returning award is a means of protest and rating down can become intimidation. Let every one discuss and  protest and at the end either agree or agree to disagree. That's what makes a successful democracy. In way we are having a very crucial national debate, let it flourish and lets make sure everyone tell what they feel rather than keeping it inside, Please don't suggest suppressing it, this will help us mature as democracy.

                            Aamir did not fall from heaven. He is a citizen of this country. Let us not forget that those who opposed Aamir's views have the same right to express themselves as Aamir did. Please do not be so 'intolerant' and 'defensive' as soon as someone opposes your views. The same yardstick applies to everyone in this ridiculous 'debate'.<br/><br/>
Meanwhile, the National media would do well avoiding being so 'celebrity-centric' and rather focus on important issues such as the Loss of life and property in Tamil Nadu (which regretably got very little coverage), the current impasse in Parliament, Terror in Kashmir where brave Colonel Santosh Mahadik paid the ultimate sacrifice to the country, Rise of extremism in Punjab, Problems of Farmers, the upcoming Paris Conference on Climate Change etc.<br/><br/>
And to Mr. Ashutosh, hope the same yardstick applies to Mr. Kejiriwal and AAP. Hope he doesn't end up being a Nitish Kumar, who was forced to take the help of a corrupt leader just to stay in power and thereby compromise the very idealogy which took him to where he is now. Hope his party doesn't support the Khalistani extremism.<br/><br/>
How I wish we could go back to the 90s when Evening News was informative and covered entire India rather than this Delhi-Mumbai based intellectual and celebrity-centric coverage; and the ensuing silly debates filled with egotists and elitists.

People of India are smart and they realise the political game being played by likes of you. People might react here and there but in larger context they wont fall for the trap you guys are laying up. Mr. Modi will make India a developed and prosperous nation with support from India's population. You can keep trying and trying but you wont succeed for sure.

                            Now that's new one ... But Mr. Ashutosh pls understand that the reactions are so strong because people loved, admired Aamir and NOT because his religion. People of this country not as small minded to react so strongly just because of the religion. It is you who is linking religion to all this. Another reason is Aamir expressed discontent for the country which evoked the patriot in us not the religious fanatic. Yes Aamir or anyone for that matter should express what they think without fear.. But this happens when an idolized respected individual's expressions are so far from reality.

                            Ashutosh, firstly all Indians including leftist need to support Modi in achieving the development agenda. Secondly opposition leaders and celebrities need to have engagement with the government where they feel things are not right. But it's right to say things have changed only in last 18 months. Because of congress and leftists policy Hindus are feeling cheated. They should equally celebrate all religious festival.

Sincerely hope that our elected leaders will fight tooth and nail any subversion of our democratic institutions, because the mandate was not for that.

                            Your article is not worth responding. You think you have the sole right to be the torch bearer of what should be said and what should not be. When you talk about freedom of thought then it is also applies to all those 'INDIANS' who are Indians and not Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian. These very people are hurt by what Mr. Aamir Khan has said about our country. It is not about our PM nor about some Mr. Khan but YES its about my country so I, as others also have every right to criticize Mr. Aamir Khan, stop using any brand/ portal which he is endorsing and you Mr. Ashutosh don't have any right (under the same principal of fundamental right of freedom of expression) to come and start preaching others. Channels like NDTV has kept a space for all those people like you for India bashing in the name of secularism when their own interests (read their political master's interest) are not fulfilled. You give this opportunity of writing these blogs to criticise people's comments on exclusive spaces in channels like NDTV and I assure you that any one of us 'Ordinary' citizen can give you a befitting reply.

                            Brilliantly analysed and written. Aamir Khan and Kiran Rao may have overstated but also understandable considering the fact that when ur own children are concerned u some time imagine the threat more. Many of us do not agree with Aamir's view point but he has a right to say. And no one can deny there has been significant increase in intolerance to anything that is different from ruling party's ideology. Why we cannot simply disagree and submit our view point. What is more fearful and deeply concerning are the profanities and obscenities thrown at anyone who has a differing view point. The deep fear is against the rise of fascism be it culinary or social or cultural. This tendency of becoming self styled custodians of patriotism, nationalism and certifying everyone as anti national or unpatriotic who has a different view is extremely dangerous. As the writer clearly states his case this tendency is a roller coaster towards a extreme right wing Taliban / Daesh type Hindu State in India. Except the "Bhakts" the overwhelming majority of Indians would surely be very concerned and perturbed at the ominous early signs.

                            We have been hearing stories about Pakistan's disintegration since so many decades. But it seems to remain the same, even emerging stronger, inspite of these prophets of doom. Inspite of being our enemy number 1, it would pay to understand Pakistan better than from the myopic lens of jingoism. Today as things stand, their ballistic missiles (allegedly sourced from North Korea in lieu of the nuke technology shared) is better than India's. So are their cruise missiles (courtesy   re-engineering the Tomahawk missiles that fell in Paki territory during the first strikes after 9/11). The nuke technology, achieved by crook, is again ahead of ours.Their Al-Khalid tanks, JF-17 Thunder aircraft are better than our Arjun tanks and Tejas aircraft. While our DRDO manufactured drone achieved a 100% failure rate in the trials with the army, Pakistani drones are being used against militants in Waziristan. If we have Aadhar, they too have NADRA. The deep-sea Gwadar port, once it develops, will change the economic traffic in a way which our economic planners can only dream of. It is easy to dismiss them as a potpourri of mad Jihadists, low on intelligence and high on rabid hatred of India which is true but they are presently marching ahead of us.Instead of recognising this threat, our politicians "sickular" and "intolerant" alike, tend to dismiss them as a failed state which is not true.

                            Pakistan is a failed state from its inception day1. RSS follow the British &amp; Jinnah's two nation theory, one shouldn't forget that truth. Still their aim is to fail our freedom movement,all controversies with Gandhi-Nehru-Patel &amp; Bose, belongs to RSS vicious program which Modi government is fully helping in executing it.

                            The division of India on religion showed sheer incompetence of JLN,MDKG, MAJ &amp; other sundry.  Undivided India was a huge threat to British because it's influence was till Turkey and this was not acceptable to British.  They wanted to divide and our forefathers played into British designs. This is part 1.  Part 2 is, Snapdeal hired AK for his perceived intrinsic value as an actor. So associating AK with Snapdeal helped Snapdeal to create it's own intrinsic value. When AK expressed himself, he offended certain people who were very well in their right to remove the app, downrate the app &amp; at the end stop buying from Snapdeal.  This is not a threat, but expression of freedom as defined by constitution of this country. Your expression is right &amp; mine is bigotry is bigotry.  Free expression is you have your say &amp; I retain right to respond to which you have all right to respond so on &amp; so forth.

                            Fine Asutosh let's take your ridiculous argument one step behind. Before independence, some moderate Muslim intellectuals with significant following (most notably Allama Iqbal) started saying that India is not conducive for Muslims as a Hindu majority India will treat Muslims as second class citizens. It was obviously a lie and a flawed personal opinion of the intellectuals of that time. However, the sentiment caught steam and became a popular movement giving birth to Muslim league's demand for a separate Pakistan. We all know what happened next. I find the recent expression of opinions by Shahrukh and Aamir hauntingly similar to Allama Iqbal. It is important to note that Allama Iqbal used to be a great Indian nationalist and secular in his youth and even penned the legendary Sare Jahan se Accha. Go figure!!

                            Wonderful article. Each and every Pakistani, Indian, and Bangladeshi  youth should read this. it is difficult to gauge what exactly Aamir said and in which tone...it he was like any other Indian just expressed his discontent, I see no harm in it. In no way I think India is becoming like Pakistan and is fast becoming "intolerant", doesn't matter who says what.<br/>
My personal opinion is that Aamir and Sharukh should join politics with tons of money that they have now, if they want to change India to become more tolerant than it is now. Isolated comments from them may create misunderstandings because they are Muslims and also because they are icons of the Country. People should therefore express restraint while criticising them. Having said that..."wife wondered if  we should leave India" was a gross over reaction. She should not have said that. Where would you go by the way? Nowhere in the world you would enjoy the privilege that you are having in India. So stay and change India for good and please don't over react.

                            Thank you Ashutosh for helping me come out of my shell. I have kept a restraint on myself on not to write on social media. I just could NOT help it when I read this article. What Aamir Khan or Kiran Rao feels matters SO MUCH!! that it made you draw this analogy. Really!!!<br/><br/>
PLEASE STOP THESE MINDLESS CONVERSATIONS AND ARTICLES. Your pen is writing off all the positivism we have gained in the last couple of years or could gain in future. You exaggerated to the hilt in this article and it is totally nonsensical and draws an incorrect analogy.<br/><br/>
This is for all of us - DO NOT GENERALIZE and EXTRAPOLATE so easily; DO NOT MISUSE THE POWER OF PEN and YOUR BIG MOUTH assuming that YOU CAN in a democracy. Please do understand that not everyone is blessed with the gift to understand and rationalize statements. Let us NOT get blinded by our selfish interests and push our country in the flames of unnecessary controversies.     <br/><br/>
Think about everyone's development, security of our state and country. How can you contribute? I feel pained by such statements, especially when I hear about our armymen getting killed by those anti-social and anti-human elements. <br/><br/>
One negative thoughts ignites more and more hatred and does not reflect our country's thought in general. Let us be positive and critical in a constructive way of what is not happening right now. What you said in the article is another form of EXTREMISM that does not have even an iota of constructive feedback but only pessimism and hatred toward ruling government. I could even sense a smell of opportunism.Please understand that revolution, without an genuine objective to serve the interest of masses <br/><br/>
So, let us stand together, be rational and believe in our country. It is and will be the best country to live in, provided that people blessed with better capabilities, lead the way in the path of peace and prosperity.

                            Ashuotsh before certifying anyone as intolerant or generalising this discussion on Aaamir without any concrete facts, needs to check within his own party AAP, possibly through SMS, whether today it has become intolerant of dissenting voice or not.<br/><br/>
Also, I would like to know his views on alcohol ban and why they have not raised any voice on this against Nitish.

                            Go to Youtube and search for 'Hassan Nissar'. He is a Pakistani intellectual who regularly blasts the ruling regime and the sorry state of education in their country. For them History starts with 8th century AD and they have disowned the glorious past associated with the past civilizations. <br/><br/>
By the time the RSS and its associates finish with the rewriting of Indian History with the help of ICHR, Indian history will look totally different. The difference between mythology and history will cease to exist. <br/><br/>
I am with Ashutosh on this one, though I normally disagree with him. <br/><br/>
As far as the reaction to Aamir's statement goes, what we have seen is a public lynching in the virtual world. Looks like all the prejudices against the Muslims have come pouring out with Aamir being the target. A very sad state of affairs, especially when one considers what an excellent role model he has been . <br/><br/>
I beg to differ with Mr Amanullah - our country looks good when sane voices speak up when it matters.

                            I don't understand why Aamir Khan saying something is freedom of speech but people countering him are Intolerant! Why is the test of tolerance in accepting quietly what Aamir Khan is saying? Sure, some people may have gone personal but that should be expected isn't it? Some people will always do that and it happens on both sides of the divide. On the other hand some people have asked very pointed questions to which Aamir &amp; his cronies have no reply hence they point out at the hot heads saying look at this intolerance! Very smart! Whether it's Aamir or anyone, you cannot say there is intolerance and get away. Give us instances and back up your claim. Just because you are a celebrity or intellectual you have unhindered freedom of speech while the same luxury is not afforded to common people. Isn't that intolerance too?

We should have free speech, doesn't mean that we have the free-will to speak anything. When a celebrity speaks, he has to face the wrath of people, as he accepts the complements gracefully. So there is nothing wrong in people reacting.<br/><br/>
And moreover, what is the Govt's fault in it? You are equally responsible as a citizen. So please do not confuse people. Being an AAP supporter, I feel disgusted by the viewpoints expressed in this article

Amir has earned love of people and while it his choice to move out of country but definitely if he brands whole country as intolerant he has got a well deserved Flak.In fact he has not faced anything compared to what cricketers face after a bad performance . <br/>

                            I would advise that Mr Ashutosh should share one copy of his article to each AAP members and then check how much effective his article is.<br/><br/>
AAP party forgot what were their vision and goals and what they are doing?   The Experiment with AAP has been failed and once again dream of common people could not be fulfill!!

                            ashutosh you literally blew this out of proportion! On a serious note you are a shameless hypocrite. I do live in the same country where Mr. Aamir khan lives and I don't see anything around that he mentioned in his speech.

                            I have been a BLO for AAP. The people who are saying India has become intolerant are the most intolerant here. The way you guys over react and look at the extent here, ashutosh compares modi with bhutto. On what basis, god/allah knows ??<br/><br/>
AAP is doing average on ground in delhi but your thoughts and ideology is getting worse by the day. Why dont u understand, Modi is not responsible for what all the Indians say or do. If something bad happens, you point it to Modi blinly. How is Modi responsible for people giving 1 rating to snapdeal app or deleting them. Its because their sentiments are hurt. You can simply agree/disagree with this behavior but dnt crib like a baby and start comparing Indo Pak.

                            This is not reaction this is result of irresponsible statement by public figure. Nobody should make stupid statements otherwise consequences will be bad.

                            Really Ashutosh? Would you stop using history and your pathetic common sense to spin stories and speculate crazy concoctions against the PM of India that has no bearing to reality. If anything, Pakistan is a prime example of an extremely intolerant society and a country where minorities have no human rights what so ever. The fact that Aamir Khan is a super star is proof enough that India and Hindus (that make 80% of the country) are fairly secular and respectful of other religions and opinions. The fact that minority population in India continues to grow while it has dwindled beyond recognition in Pakistan is proof to the pudding of Indian democratic and securlar fabric that finds its grounding in Hindu faith that teaches respect for other ideologies and ways of life. Please stop spitting venom against the PM of India and show some respect.

                            Avery good article in Indian context but Name of Modi diluted whole thing.Finally it appears to be written by AAP member rather than independent journalist.

                            very well written BUT HE FORGOT THIS IS HINDU MAJORITY COUNTRY.COMMON MAN WILL NEVER SACUMB TO EXTREMIST IDEAS, at the same time he will not accept attacks on his faith now. Before giving advice to others, will you please look into your behavior what we call apne gireban me zako. Your treatment to yogendra Yadav, shanti bhushan kiran bedi sazia ilmi at the same time somnath bharti, AND Alka lamba.

                            one more thing please let us know, when you have 67/70 MLA in Delhi assembly what took it one year to table "jan lokpal bill", how much did you dilute it?? when are you guys going to debate this issue with Mr. Bhushan? When AAP was created we thought finally we have a party which will have educated people and will change Indian politics, then we realised how good you guys really are? I repent that I wasted a part of my hard earned money by donating it to your party!
