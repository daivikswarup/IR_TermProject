Headline::::Stop Calling Women 'Girls'. It's Either Patronising or Sexually Suggestive



DateTime::::2015-07-09T12:29:00+05:30




                                Girls. Here, there and everywhere . They are even stepping out of 10 Downing Street, according to one paparazzi photographer .I write of the moment education secretary Nicky Morgan and energy secretary Amber Rudd were met with a call of "Morning, girls!" from one snapper.Morgan, who is also minister for women - that's women - and equalities, was unimpressed, retorting: "Girls? Girls?!" The photographer then apologised.Morgan is 42, Rudd 51. Neither of them are girls. So why do we continue to call women - aka adults - girls?The term "girls" should really be limited to the under-13s. After that, add the prefix of "teenage", and I'd say around the age of 16, shift to referring to "young women". Then, at 18: women. It's not difficult."Girls" screams of gender-segregated toys and the colour pink. It reads: childhood and vulnerability.Sure, the incredibly popular American series from Lena Dunham is titled Girls - but this is a series which focuses on the tricky transition between college years and adulthood.'Girls' screams gender-segregated toys and the colour pink.The characters are often presented as spoilt, immature and learning to deal with real life: paying bills, getting jobs, soldering relationships. The title is intentional.Dunham's memoir, Not That Kind of Girl , charts similar territory. Girl, Interrupted , the memoir of Susanna Kaysen, and later made into a film, also follows transition in the life of an 18-year-old.As the playwright and commentator Bonnie Greer once put it : "A girl is someone who is not an adult, not a grownup, is not someone who takes responsibility for herself."Calling women "girls" is especially undermining and patronising in the workplace. People might say this is oversensitive (I am a woman after all), but in a world in which substantial pay inequality and glass ceilings still exist, language matters.There's a simple rule to test whether something is sexist: would the situation be the same if applied to a man and not a woman?I cannot imagine a group of male senior executives referred to as "boys", but it's easy to conjure up "girls" in the reverse scenario.England's women's football team - World Cup bronze medal winners no less - were frequently referred to as "girls" by pundits and commentators.One might argue that male footballers are referred to as "lads" or "the boys", which is true. But these terms are not so loaded.The phrase "throw like a girl" for instance, is not common parlance. Men don't constantly have to prove that they can play sport to a high standard. Men don't get their arses commented upon as Olympic gold medal winners.The flip-side to the term girls, when not used as the patronising verbal equivalent of pinching someone's cheeks or a pat on the head, is sexual.It's a leer on the street: "All right, girls?" Or men talk about "pulling girls". Or, as the otherwise fabulous Elvis would have it : "Girls, on the beaches / oh what peaches!"It says a lot about the sexualisation of young women that the term "girls" refers to both pre-teens and women as sexual objects, but we won't go into that here .Then, there's just "girl" as a lazy, impersonal address when a random man can't be bothered to ask your name. Beyond rude.Finally, I'm also not a fan of the "girls' night out". What exactly is a "girls' night out"? Drinking through penis-shaped straws, while group hair-straightening? Let's leave this phrase to bargain bin CD compilations featuring Atomic Kitten. What exactly is a 'girls' night out'?It's great that young women are feeling more confident about calling themselves feminists and standing up for principles of equality without having to hide behind " girl power ". Something that always felt a little bit of the comic strip.I'll be honest here and say I do think women calling other women girls get a free pass. I know people hate it when free passes exist, but it's the way of things. I might swap a "girl, please" with a close female friend, or even a "gurl".Ditto the meta "Hey Girl" Ryan Gosling macro, which blossomed into the beautiful Feminist Ryan Gosling meme. But for real, these things are very different from a male boss saying "good job, girls" to professional women in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and upwards. Let's not pretend otherwise.Beyonce was almost right. But it's not girls that run the world - although one day it may well be women.Article Source: www.theguardian.comDisclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            This is called making mountains out of mole hills. My dear lady, for your information, even grwon up grey bearded army men are sometimes called boys!!! does that mean they are being patronized or being sexually suggestive?<br/><br/>
probably more indicative of your convoluted and one-directional bent of mind!!!

                            This "girl" needs to get a life. There are more important things that matter in life than some gender based perceived slight.

                            Take a chill pill - you dilute your own (non-existent) point by straying into all sorts of REAL gender inequality issues (pay, corporate glass ceilings, objectification) but to link it all back to 'girls' is inane.  Difference is men would never even notice being called boys - it happens all the time by the way.

                            Start with telling the 'dream girl' of India who at mid-sixties thinks she is 16 and puts in on her twitter handle! How ridiculous can some people get in boosting their vanity.

                            I'm perfectly happy for women's football teams to be referred to as girls, it's a great way to redefine what 'throws like a girl' means. Offensive language needs to be owned and redefined, not banned and brushed under the carpet under the garb of political correctness.

                            So Glad that some woman stood up and so clearly rebutted those trivial minds. I wish all women stand up this way.

                            This is just ridiculous.  I am all for women getting equal rights and opportunities and all, but when you start to take offense at imaginary slights, and you are hurting the cause by belittling the whole idea of women equality.<br/><br/>
I dont know about any other organization, but every place that I have worked, we have referred to a group of women - meetings, casual gathering, etc, basically anyplace there were only females - as "ladies", not "girls".  Its always been "Hi there, ladies", "Good morning, ladies", "good job, ladies".  I have never heard of anyone calling them "girls"<br/><br/>
Now, how about this.  How many women call their female friends "my girlfriends", or talk about "a girls night out", or for that matter, do you call your significant other a "girlfriend"/"boyfriend", or would you call them "womanfriend" and "manfriend" ?  Oh wait, are those terms also things that Men have forced women to use in conversation ?  <br/><br/>
There are more important things to worry about - rape, female infanticide, dowry, just to name a few.  Priorities, Lady.  Yes, "Lady", not "girl" - Happy ?

                            This is a typical issue where Women (including girls) give leeway to boys and men. It is important to avoid a sense of self-pity and guilt.  By not doing so, we give another opportunity to men to patronise or suggest sexually.  If women stop feeling subjected when addressed as girls, it'll terminate the issue. <br/><br/>
Pl stop trivialising Women and Girls alike!

                            May you want stop calling men as 'boys' to belittle them. I understand that we should be mutually respectful of each other. That take a deeper understanding of dharmic cultures &amp; traditions.
