Headline::::I've Rescued Jawans At Siachen. You Never Forget It.



DateTime::::2016-02-05T14:16:00+05:30




                                The sad news of ten Army jawans being buried in an avalanche on the Siachen Glacier has once again highlighted the perils and challenges that the Indian Army has been resolutely facing for the past three decades in the highest battlefield of the world.
This writer had the good fortune of supporting the first Army expedition to the Glacier in 1978, a full six years before Op Meghdoot was launched on 13 April 1984, and thereafter again in the mid-'90s while commanding the Siachen Pioneers helicopter unit at Leh. The Glacier had changed, and has continued to change literally every year, but what has not decreased one bit is the commitment of the Indian jawan towards protecting those most inhospitable mountains in the world, where not a blade of grass grows but what is our sacred land.
An Army paltan (battalion) spends three months at a stretch on the Glacier after a very structured acclimatization process. The dangers are many, starting from a bone-jarring -40 degrees celsius to deep crevasses, and from serious medical problems due to the high altitude to avalanches that strike without warning.
I have evacuated many casualties, serious and not so serious, but can never forget the haunting and helpless look of a strapping young Naga lad of around 20 odd years who was suffering from cerebral edema (in which water collects in the brain due to the effects of high altitude). Preparing to go back from Base Camp to Leh one afternoon, we were asked to go for an urgent cas evac (casualty evacuation) to a helipad called 'Golf.' Cas Evac requests override everything else and off we went to 'Golf.' As he was put in our Cheetah helicopter, I asked him above the din of the rotors, "Kaise ho (how are you feeling)?" With great effort, he moved his hand to give me a "thumbs up".  
When we landed at Base Camp, a mere 15 minutes later, that handsome boy who could give our filmi heroes a run for their money, was lifeless. We had lost another hero for a national cause.
In the avalanche at Siachen this week, ten Indians in the prime of their youth would have just heard a rumble or a roar as the snow wall would have descended on them. They would have taken a crouching position to form a bubble of air, if possible, before the snow enveloped them. The helicopters would have been launched from Base Camp, or machines flying in the area would have been diverted to the avalanche site. As I see the photograph of the avalanche released by the Army, I can pinpoint the place, and feel the Cheetal (Cheetah helicopter re-engined with an Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) Dhruv engine that now equips the Helicopter Unit) pilot making the approach to the helipad.
There are three deep crevasses he flies over, his eyes glued to the landing site - the co-pilot calls out his speed over each crevasse, since these are the "speed markers" for a Glacier pilot! As he crosses the third one, one into which a helicopter had slid a few years ago (the crew were pulled out with ropes), he looks for the black jerry-cans placed on the ground to provide depth perception to a pilot by breaking the monotony of the sea of white ice.
The snow flies and envelopes the helicopter in a white bowl, but the pilot's eyes stay glued to the black jerry-can that he has picked up to maintain his orientation and prevent a disorientating white-out. The helicopter touches down and a blast of icy cold air hits the pilot as he opens the door and yells "kahan hai (where are you)?"
The helipad party would have pointed to the avalanche site, the Cheetal would have taken off and circled the area but to no avail - an avalanche covers everything in its wake. The pilots would have seen the rescue teams of jawans digging maniacally to get their comrades out, waiting only to catch their breath - at 19,000 feet, the oxygen content is just half of that at sea level. A few deep puffs from oxygen bottles, and then back to digging -  alas, in this case, no one could be pulled out.
Once the jawans are found, the Cheetals would fly-in again, this time to bring back the mortal remains of their comrades in olive green. I can imagine what would be going through the minds of those pilots - they too would never forget the sight, as I can't of that young Naga Regiment boy in 1995.
Rest in peace braves! The nation can never - NEVER - repay your debt. But we all know that the scroll at the Base Camp Memorial typifies what you were and would continue to be:"Quartered in snow, silent to remain.
When the bugle calls, they shall rise and march again."(The author, a retired Air Vice Marshal, is a Distinguished Fellow at the Centre for Air Power Studies, New Delhi.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Thank you Air Marshal saheb, for so vividly describing the hostile environment in Sialchen (so true of many other locations throughout the country where our troops operate) and the daring rescue operations carried out by the brave hearts of the Air Force. Every time there is a loss of precious army men's lives, it breaks the hearts of this nation. I have had many friends in the Army and the IAF who have served in Sialchen and it sends shivers down my spine when they describe the harsh and inhospitable conditions in and around the area. All I can do is to stand at attention and salute all you brave hearts and send a prayer to the Almighty to keep all our brethren in the Services safe and in good health.

                            Why don't we start using Drones if not any advance medium instead of posting Jawan's, to safeguard these frontiers which carries 100% risk on our Brave Jawan's life.

                            I lost a cousin in an avalanche along with 13 soldiers in Siachen. We are proud to serve in the most inhospitable and treacherous terrain. But what  is galling is that a bureaucrat or IPS officer serving in the North East or in Leh town gets almost double as 'hardship' allowance than an Armed Forces equivalent individual. The country is being taken for a ride by the Babus and Politicians in power couldn't care less!

                            Sir, as the eyes skimmed over the words, it formed a running picture in the mind. Each word is true and even the chill could be felt when the doors are opened. On hearing the news a thought was passing through my mind, about half a decade ago when "Mars" flew over this area, crevasses were constantly forming and in summers they were wide enough to engulf a complete football field. The snout has receded almost 500m in last one decade. Probably the crust of ice is thinning out. Who is monitoring all this? A SASE news release says they had warned of a snow avlanche in the general area, which is hardly of any consequence. The place is not only to be protected but conserved too. The valour and sacrifice of Indian Army deserves the highest respect, where simple survival itself is impossible, for decades they have held the fort. Jai Hind..

                            The Air Marshal should continue his contribution to the country's National Security in a higher capacity in the times to come. This would be a value addition to our state of affairs.

                            Sir, I have a different question . Is it worth those human lives and the amount of money we spent <br/>
on maintaining such assets in  siachen glacier ? Is it militarily avoidable expense, forget about any peace move with pakistan, even with a hostile pakistan, do we really need such massive deployment ? Have our military generals evaluated the whole thing ? Instead of always pointing fingers at IAS all the time , the <br/>
correct deployment of forces are in the domain of Military, which they need to do a lot of work.<br/>
If we work cohesively on this subject, a lot of avoidable deployments can be identified and solutions can be found out . <br/><br/>
In india, the problem is that when there is a problem in a particular area especially in Northeast/J&amp;K, we  deploy police,paramilitary, military and so on. WE never address the issue or evaluate the deployment.
