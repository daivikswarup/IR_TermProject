Headline::::Why I Cannot Discuss The CPI(M) Calmly



DateTime::::2016-02-03T06:57:00+05:30




                                Both social and professional friends - from school mates to fellow politicians in Delhi to journalists and old colleagues - have often told me that I seem to be a fairly easy-going person until the discussion moves to the CPI(M). "At that point," a friend laughingly said, "even in a living room, you seem to be speaking like you are on a television debate."
The remark was meant as a jibe but got me thinking. It is true. My response to the CPI(M) is emotional and personal, It is one of the key reasons why I entered politics under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee, confident that only she and the Trinamool Congress could unseat the Communists in West Bengal. But nevertheless, my emotional and personal hostility to the CPI(M)'s politics is based on hard facts and data. It is the story of a tragedy that we have lived through in West Bengal from 1977 to 2011. (I was a teenager when the CPI(M) came to power.)
That is why, while I want my party, Trinamool, to win the 2016 assembly election - and I am confident that we will win - I also want the CPI(M) to lose badly so that Bengal doesn't have to ever suffer them again. These two goals may seem the same, but they are not. They speak for the mess we inherited in 2011. An economist friend studied the state of Bengal's economy just before the election that year and gave us a report. He handed me the document with the preface: "They are leaving you with the aftermath of a war zone, the economy and social fabric are both in tatters. The next government's mandate is not so much to revive Bengal as to reconstruct it."
Those words still ring in my ears. The CPI(M) took the vitality out of Bengal; for me and my generation, it sucked away the best years of our youth. My university - Calcutta University - and the rich intellectual atmosphere of the education institutions in the College Street area, including my alma mater, Scottish Church College, were wrecked.
I grant you that trouble had been building since the Naxalite violence in the late 1960s-early 1970s. But that was a law and order issue, not so much about the politicisation of education and its administration. It was under the CPI(M) that good, apolitical teachers and professors were hounded out of the University and the city, Colleges became recruiting grounds for the CPI(M) and the oppression by its youth wing was so evident that ordinary students were scared.
Vice-Chancellors  and college principals cowered before the local CPI(M) strongman. The Education Secretary in the state secretariat, a professional civil servant, and the academics on College Street were forced to take orders from party bosses and their henchmen. The principle was not academic excellence, it was thought control. The control mechanism went down to the level of schools.
The budget for all such institutions was centralised, which put an unnecessary burden on the state exchequer and crowded out non-government funding, with long-term consequences. For the 34 years of CPI(M) rule, it meant that the party officials who controlled the purse-strings also controlled educational institutions, curriculum, transfers and postings- everything.
One instrument to control educational institutions was unionisation. The academic and teachers' community was divided ("sliced and diced" would be a better expression) by wholesale CPI(M) hijacking of bodies such as the All-Bengal Teachers' Association and the West Bengal College and University Teachers' Association. So busy was the Communist government with all this that hardly any new institutions of consequence were set up.
In the past five years, one doesn't have to be a Trinamool partisan to realise that the atmosphere of academic and intellectual freedom has improved dramatically on our campuses. 15 new universities and 46 new colleges have been set up. An incremental 2,500 primary, 3,500 middle and 1,815 high schools have been added. Above all, more than 50,000 teachers have been employed in schools and colleges - and nobody has asked questions about their voting preferences. That just doesn't matter.
Getting anguished about universities and their sabotage by the CPI(M) may seem an elitist pastime in a country of such poverty and grim inequalities. Yet, it was not as if the CPI(M)'s single-minded dictatorial streak was any different in rural Bengal. The same cynical and self-serving mindset applied - "Obey the CPI(M) or get pushed out".
I got a first-hand taste of this between 2005 and 2008 when I visited Singur (Hooghly district) and Nandigram (Midnapore). In both areas, the CPI(M)-led government decided to hand over vast tracts of multi-crop agricultural land to industrial groups to build factories. The manner in which land was sought to be acquired was a stunning display of muscle and cynicism, backed by the might of the state and the police.
In Nandigram, 14 farmers were shot and killed in police firing. Protesting farmers and their families were mercilessly beaten by CPI(M) hoodlums. In Singur, the then government claimed 95 per cent of farmers had voluntarily given up their land and accepted compensation. Actually, they had been brutalised and tortured, women had been raped, and signatures had been faked. I saw it firsthand   and was witness to the valiant struggle in Singur led by Mamata Banerjee. I realised then that the CPI(M) leadership had lost its very humanity. It had become a curse on the people of Bengal.
Let's take just one example. Surya Kanta Mishra, then Minister of Health, set up six Sick Newborn Care Units (SNCUs) during his tenure. In the last five years, the government has set up 48 such SNCUs and also provides free medicines to the less fortunate.
Mishra's record had been so tarnished that any decent man would have retired from public life, unsure of what face to show.
Instead, Comrade Mishra is now General Secretary of the CPI(M) in Bengal and brazen enough to criticise the Trinamool government. As Abhishek Banerjee, Lok Sabha MP and leader of the Trinamool youth wing, recently said, "Wherever Surya Kanta Mishra decides to stand from this time, he would lose by 30,000 votes. Now he calls himself a former minister. Soon he would be calling himself a former MLA."
I cannot think of a better summary of the state of the CPI(M). This is like Nadir Shah coming back to Delhi and wanting to win a democratic election.(Derek O'Brien is leader, Parliamentary party Trinamool Congress (RS), and Chief National spokesperson of the party)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

1) How many industries have setup shop in bengal now that the menace of 'communist state' tag is gone. Why Infosys did not start the SEZ in the state even though they paid for the land long back? Why Wipro second campus is on hold.<br/>
2) How good is the law and order now in the state.<br/>
3) what is this 'sharada' thing considering the fact that ur party is for the people , from the people etc..

                            I couldn't agree with you more sir. They destabilized our economy in those 34 years. They ruined education and for me personally, growing up through that period was like living in the dark ages.

                            The CPIM leaders are old and feeble. Their rallies put the crowd to sleep more than anything else. By crowd i mean the 20 to 30 people who still have blind folds on to go and attend their rallies. Leave alone Surjyakanta Mishra being a former MLA, soon CPIM will be known as a former party of Bengal at the rate they are going.

                            Derek is trying to ride a high horse. But that is untenable. While most of us would agree that CPIM ruined Bengal, TMC is not doing anything either. Point-by-point counter-argument below:<br/>
1) He talks about "CPIM strongmen"- they were evil. Strangely, those strongmen are now TMC strongmen. Yes, the same people! And by joining TMC, they did not become angels overnight.<br/>
2) Derek talks about Education. He should remember that TMC people vandalised Presidency laboratory and created severe threatening atmosphere in the college. Well, Jadavpur issue also. Are these examples of great contribution to education, Derek?<br/>
3) Any intelligent question to Mamata Banerjee- you will be branded a maoist. See the TV interview if you do not believe me.<br/>
4) TMC leader issued a threat of rape against women who were following a different party than Derek. Any punishment given for such a comment? And note, he is one leader of the party, not a fringe, sideline person.<br/><br/>
That is why Derek, I cannot remain cool when I talk of CPIM or TMC in Bengal!<br/><br/>
Dare to reply Derek. I am not a Maoist even if your leader might like to think.

                            I tend to agree with Mr O Brien's analysis. West Bengal became a heavily deprived and brutalized state under CPI(M). A state that has given India its thought leaders for the past two centuries was  over a period of 30 years or so rendered barren of new and innovative ideas. Its not elitist to talk of the impact of communist rule on universities. Universities have always been the breeding ground for original ideas. When they sought to impose thought control on universities they were strangling out any possibility of new ideas that W Bengal so badly needed to escape from the clutches of poverty. <br/>
TMC has to consciously stay away from similar temptations, brutalized though they may have been under the CPI(M) rule. At the end of the day communism must be credited with the idea of affirmative state intervention for public welfare. As a country we still need state's intervention in certain key areas. This is where the communists can still make a positive contribution. Thought control in the days of internet is completely passe. But influencing thought is still very much in and desirable. Let them prove that their ideas work at the grassroots and they will find this country has a big enough heart to accept them as its children

                            That brought back a lot of bad memories. I studied in school in the late 70s early 80s and it was awful living in Cal. 6-8 hour load shedding was common, as well as dirty streets, beggars, just chaos. What is disturbing is that the CPIM government racked up all this debt, but has little to show for it. How is that possible? Former Fin Min Asim Dasgupta used to argue that poverty was eliminated, but West Bengal in 2011 was still near the bottom of the barrel.  Did all that money go to the comrades? That needs to be explored.

                            CPIM left the state in such a loss that It will take TMC quite a few years to recover the losses but never the less things have improved in the last 4 and half years where development and growth is concerned hopefully it should stay like this or may be become better I think if people of Bengal can trust a party like CPIM for so long then they should also give TMC a chance for the next term and help them so that they can help us.

                            Mr. Derek O Brien Trimool has no better record. Mumta di has drive away Tata, and is super communist as far as her populist  inclination is concerned. One thing is certain that West Bengal is still practicing communist tendencies and voters approve it and due to this Bengali prevented right wing Hindu fundamentalist  extremist organisation  to grow in Bengal. All D.A.V. series of educational institution spread all over India along with Saraswati Shishu Mandir  are  infested by Sangh Parivar's extremist idealogy is working overtime to bread extremist  armed with ideology which was responsible for the assaination of Gandhi Ji. To me this increasing grip of right wing extremist  has increased the significance of Communist's ideology to neutralise the ill effect of rightists. So educational institution with left idealogy is  a welcome requirement . In this way a centrist regime can be established and inclusive growth of India can be insured as per the wishes of founders forefathers of Constitution and Republic of India  .

                            The TMC was voted for change but they turned out to be a spitting replica of CPIM. To give TMC related examples of some issues you have mentioned in your article:<br/>
- the report from your economist friend on CPIM: TMC has given grants of crores every year to local clubs (this year it is Rs 140 cr). Is this not fiscal profligacy? Can you or your party give the status of the annoucements on investments made in the Bengal Global business summit over past 3 years?<br/>
- Vice-Chancellors  and college principals cowered before the local CPI(M) strongman. The Education Secretary in the state secretariat, a professional civil servant, and the academics on College Street were forced to take orders from party bosses and their henchmen: Isnt that the same now? VCs have to turn up and sing paeans for Mamata Banerjee's administrative meetings in the state. Shonkudeb Ponda's word was god-speak till he fell out of favour on the Saradha investigation.<br/>
- Nandigram/Singur: What about the going-ons in Bolpur? One of your MLAs has publicly stated in a meeting that he murdered people. What action have you taken on that?<br/>
- In the last five years, the government has set up 48 such SNCUs and also provides free medicines to the less fortunate: A TMC minister sent a dog for dialysis at a super-speciality hospital for human beings in Calcutta. Nowhere in the world (not even a banana republic) has this been attempted.<br/><br/>
While your blood may boil on hearing about the CPIM, our blood boils on hearing either about the CPIM or the TMC. The only difference I find is that in CPIM there were a handful of financially honest (though arrogant) people, in TMC I have yet to come across any person who has any semblance of honesty.

                            Couldn't agree more with what Derek O'Brien has written. The CPI(M) systematically ruined Bengal in every sector, killed talent, dashed hopes. They ruined an entire generation with their flawed policies; yet they have the gall to criticise Mamata Banerjee who is tirelessly working to set things right. Even a section of the media, for their vested interests has been hostile. <br/><br/>
The change is visible on ground for those who have the eyes to see. Bengal in the last five years has been flourishing and will scale new heights in the days to come.

                            When O'Brien talks about the CPM he speaks the truth. It is one of the worst political parties in India, wedded to violence and electoral malpractices. Mamata has to be credited with having driven them out of Bengal. But the TMC did not behave much better after that. Hundreds of CPM supporters in the rural areas were butchered in much the same way as the CPM did earlier. And the governance record of the TMC has not been much better, though it is true that they inherited a mess. Now if only O'Brien could speak equally frankly of the TMC's record in office. Now that would require courage.

                            both the communists and trimulis are two sides of the same coin. bengal has moved on from fire to frying pan with the state lacking in every sphere. Both these parties have raped bengal so badly that it cannot  now go to the bathroom . they have transformed west bengal to waste bengal. one noticeable parivartan in bengal is that gundas of the communists have changed loyalty to TMC. Bengal had been destroyed ravaged and become a safe haven for opium farming, illegal currency and arms transaction transit point and breeding ground for all anti national elements getting direct patronage from the present dispensation to further their vote bank. (aka Malda). god save bengal from communists and trinamulies. Even God will find it very difficult to pull bengal out of the mess created by the 34 year misrule of Communists and 5 years disaster of trinamul

In effect, either communists or Trinamul, the poor victims are the youngsters of West Bengal who are one of the best in India.......<br/><br/>
But it is also a fact that your great friend congress, is not in anyway better than communists the living example being the rule of Kerala either by Communists or Congress, where almost 90% of youngsters live outside Kerala or outside India......it is because of the utter disrespect to rule of law either by communists or congress and also Trinamool is not an exception......Your leader Mamata is also an immatured and emotional leader unfit to rule a state, and she is not different to the FIRST time governments of JAYALALITHA AND MAYAWATHI, who also behaved so and bit the dust in next election........Still, even in the future elections I cannot accept a communist win and West Bengal should also escape from communists......communism mukht universe......

                            The criminal nature of CPI(M) will never change. They are hypocrites and try to mislead the public into thinking they are saviors but they are actually the fox in the hen house in disguise. They never like to talk about when they were in power because they have no face to show. Every time SKM mentions anything about any govt, I automatically think of what they did when they were in power and then it strikes me. They were worse than anything Bengal ever faced.

                            This is just political comment to promote his party. There has been no ruin of West Bengal. He is not quoting any figures to prove his point, even regarding economics. WB's performance was better than average. Human resource Development and education thrived under CPIM rule. Youth from WB got high leve education in Bengal itself. There was equality in the society.

                            It is easy to play the blame game. The difficult question is what has the TMC done since they have come to power ?<br/><br/>
1)What is the TMC government doing for the state or has done in the last 5 years?<br/><br/>
2) Which industry have you started, projects initiated, factories built, business generated? <br/><br/>
3) How do you justify a scam like Sharada within first few years of coming to power?<br/><br/>
I am a bengali who would like to return to my own state and find a job there.I am sure there are millions more individuals like myself.Can you even imagine the potential revenue that West Bengal is missing out on? <br/>
How many students do you have who eyes for joining a college/university in bengal from outside the state?<br/><br/>
Talking about the IT industry , people who go there for work complain about the archaic process and deliberate laziness.<br/>
For crying out loud, learn a lesson from Bhuvaneshwar , your neighbours.

                            DEAR DEREK, I SOOO MUCH AGREE WITH YOU.  WHAT A WASTE HAD BEEN THE 34 YEARS IN BENGAL...I HAVE A SUGGESTION, THERE NEEDS TO BE A MUSEUM TO CHRONICLE THE 34 YEARS IN BENGAL OF CPM MISRULE.. THIS HAD BEEN A PIECE OF HISTORY- COMPARABLE TO THE BRUTAL RULES IN AFRICA/ SOUTH AMERICA...HISTORY WILL BE FORGOTTEN UNLESS EVERYTHING IS DOCUMENTED AND CRONICLED  FOR THE POSTERITY... WE CANNOT FORGET THESE 34 YEARS... NOT FOR OUR CHILDREN AND THE FUTURE...

                            I don't live in Bengal. However I have very close friends from this once rich state both culturally (even now) and otherwise (many many years back). Out of many, one NRI friend after a recent visit to his home town and someone cares and follows both his home Bengal and India closely told us with a mix of sadness and anguish that CPM goondaism (which is what Derek labours to put across in his piece) has been merely replaced by Trinmool goondaism. This was an unbiased view coming from a well meaning Indian who has no political or other axe to grind and someone who is well informed about his state, visits it regularly, keeps in touch. Whilst we (I, a non Bengali and my mates from the state) agree entirely that CPI M ruined and murdered every institution in the state during their rule, we have come to believe that Trinamool rule seems to heading in the same direction. And let Mr Derek also know that the impression of my visiting NRI friend , a very dear Bengali to the core, only reinforced the periodical feed back from my other mates from the state that once was the pride of the country. I don't what Mr Derek has to say, but he ought to know this because at the end of the day, winning elections does not mean anything. Remember, CPIM won elections uninterrupted for 30 odd years!

                            Derek, whereas I agree with you that WB has suffered badly with CPM at the helm, let me remind you that it has suffered worse at the hands of the TMC. The CPM had left a little to destroy, and Mamata the 'artist' (no pun intended), has completed the job very quickly, and if allowed to continue will by default, gift WB to Bangladesh<br/><br/>
Stop behaving like a lackey-you have done it long enough,therefore,please come to your senses<br/><br/>
Moral cowardice has always been the bane of Bengalis', and it is becoming too apparent now<br/><br/>
Once the leading region of this country, even less than 40 years ago, we Benagalis' are treated all over the country with the contempt we deserve

                            Mr Derek. You have lost any credibility when you started supporting a goon and mob party like TMC. Be it the CPI-M or TMC, both are looting Bengal by supporting goons and mafia and at the same time putting a porous border with Bangladesh bringing an exodus of foreign Muslims to India , all so that you can win the next elections.

We can see through that this article is a hello testing to understand the pulse of people towards your party, the fact remains that the educated wont prefer you and you have your ways to lure people to vote for you. <br/><br/>
If you really have the brain, mr. Brein, try and do something good for the people genuinely, which you failed utter miserably.

                            It will be more interesting to know about the institutionalization of corruption under the Trinamul rule. Trinamul leaders  can  teach all of us about the most viable way of operating ponzi schemes. We can have quiz on that too!

                            @Gulam Mohd. Sadiq : CPIM pride themselves on scientifically rigging elections. The need for people to know before they vote is why 34 years of Stockholm Syndrome has to be brought to light. No doubt they can produce generations of leaders but at the end of the day they need to lead to be called leaders. All they do is follow. Just like you, following blindly and if the confidence of the so called leaders are so high why the merger with congress. Spineless and uneducated leaders. You would stand a better chance as a CPIM candidate. Use your google search bar to find out the meaning of Stockholm Syndrome just like you did to find a reply to my comment. This one isn't in your script.

                            Mr.Derek,Well summarised the events during CPI(M)rule.The state was always in poverty as it is breeding ground for growth of communism.See to it that they do not come back at any cost.If needed, you may have alliance with any party but do not allow them to come back.At the same time encourage industrialists to come to your state.This advise is to forget the misery TATAS had suffered and ultimately the Shareholders.

                            Completely agree the during that rule..CPI(M) has destroyed Bengal so that we all have to move out from Bengal for better prospects. They have ruined the state and also we have leave our homeland to earn.<br/>
But i also dont agree with few points on the educational institutions. What CPI(M) used to do, is being done by TMC in the same manner. The same people are doing as they have just switched sides for there own benefit.<br/>
Also I do agree that we have not seen development in terms of industrial growth but have seen massive development in terms of infrastructure growth like roads, basic health centers to facilitate the growth of industries. We should also stop comparing what is happening in Kolkata and its surroundings but rather see what is happening all over WB including the improvement in rural areas.

                            While whatever you've mentioned about Left Rule in Bengal is 100% true, the fact that your party is no better is also 100% true. After all a large No of TMC leaders are the erstwhile CPM goons who jumped ship when they read the winds changing &amp; your party gladly accepted them, for the votes they brought. Moreover, your record in wooing Muslims, not bothering about even National Security is a shame

                            CPM rule in both Bengal and Kerala have been "Dark Ages" for both the states and resulted in a lot of Intellectual, Economic, Industrial and Social damage. Luckily, for Kerala, every 5 years, there was a break from Communist Rule. Alternately,Capital flow due to Gulf Remittances was able to offset the damage done by Communism. But for Gulf Remittances, Kerala would have been a highly literate "Bihar". Rather than blindly opposing BJP,forward thinking intellectuals like Derek O Brien, should see the nationalism,committment and lack of corruption of BJP, compared to Indian National Congress and Communists. Like Bihar, there is every likelihood of all non-TMC, non-BJP opportunistic parties like CPM,INC,AAP,JD(U),RJD,SP etc..etc forming an unholy lesson to defeat TMC in Bengal.
