Headline::::India Needs its Own Charlie Hebdo



DateTime::::2015-01-08T18:47:00+05:30



(Sidharth Bhatia is a Mumbai based journalist and author)Two main reactions have emerged after the horrific attack by masked gunmen on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo which ended in a bloodbath, killing its editor and most of its top roster of cartoonists. The first is unqualified revulsion at the sheer brutality with which the shooters went about their job, barging in with Kalashnikovs and gunning down those present and then killing policemen before they sped off in a car. The second, while expressing shock, tempers it with the "need to be responsible" while commenting on and lampooning certain "sensitive" subjects. (There is of course the loony glee of those who say, "See, we told you they were like that, unlike us who are peaceful," but let us put that aside.)There cannot be two opinions on the fact and manner of the killing-it resulted in the death of several citizens who were doing their job. The magazine is an equal opportunity offender, and is much loved - and reviled - for its portrayals of all manner of people and beliefs. Its cartoons on Christianity are as bitingly sharp as those on other religions. The Pope and sundry bishops are much-loved targets for the Hebdo team. One showed a Cardinal, a Mullah and a Rabbi marching together against Charlie Hebdo. Another depicted the skeleton of Michael Jackson with the headline, "Finally white." An Indian man was shown looking after his cow but mistreating his wife. The prophet Muhammed has been drawn by its cartoonists too. In short, the boundaries of religion, political correctness and bad taste are routinely crossed and broken, which is what all good satire should do. Every culture has its Holy Cows and it is important for a society to have someone who pokes and prods them regularly, even if it draws a bit of blood. Humankind would never progress otherwise.This is what those who say "Let's not cross this line or the other" do not understand. Cultures are not frozen in time-they are dynamic, ever-changing organisms. There are hundreds of interpretations of the Ramayana-which one is "authentic" and who decides that? A K Ramnujan's essay on Ramayana spoke precisely of the multitude of traditions and it was banned by Delhi University because of objections by those who do not like that idea. Christians have objected to films (Last Temptation of Christ), plays (Jesus Christ Superstar) and books (Da Vinci Code). Within religions too, there are different sects who interpret the Holy Books in different ways. Who is to decide which one to respect more than the other? The most recent example is that of the film PK-some Hindutva groups went on a rampage against it for making fun of Godmen and superstition-but the film has raked in 300 crore rupees, so clearly there are a large number of Hindus who enjoyed the film and its message.Once you begin to draw lines-religion, elders, tradition and that highly dangerous word, culture-healthy skepticism goes out of the window and society is diminished. It becomes dull and conformist. It would be wrong to think that only conservative elements indulge in boundary-setting; those who call themselves liberals are no less complicit in this exercise. Political correctness has gone to ridiculous extents; an ever larger number of things are now in the list of Things That Must Never Be Made Fun Of. Fingers are pointed at the slightest infraction-bizarrely, some liberal types have begun to sound highly conservative. In India, "This hurts my sentiments" has assumed epidemic proportions with the result that a filmmaker, author or journalist thinks several times before addressing some issues, lest someone or the other object. This has a chilling effect on society and its artists, ultimately circumscribing original thought and development. Without iconoclasts, we would not today have so many things, from women's lib movements to social reform. At the very least,  satire makes us smile and then think. In fact, what India needs right now is its own Charlie Hebdo.There will be mischief -makers who will take full advantage of Freedom of Expression principles. They are not objective analysts or even satirists-they just want to provoke with incendiary remarks. That is the price a society pays-laws are meant to deal with those who are out to cause trouble, but the Principle cannot be jettisoned.Which is why, while we outright condemn the killers of the cartoonists, we cannot at the same time qualify it by saying, "some things should be respected" because that leads to "They should have been more careful" and then "They had it coming." Charlie Hebdo had been firebombed twice, but that did not stop its team from continuing with its outrageous commentary and cartoons issue after issue. It is possible that it will not stop doing so now either, even if it will hurt. Because you can kill a few men, but you cannot kill Freedom of Expression, the very cornerstone of democracy.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the

                            No matter what he writes about, he has to criticize 'hindutva' group. Old habits die hard. Understand that the protest against PK was limited to sloganeering and some morchas, not a rampage with AK 47s.

                            I think the entire English media establishment acts like harlie Hebdo to the majority section of India and today we are at a point that media anchors question the security forces just to appease one section of India. Media anchors should understand that appeasing Pakistan by questioning our security forces will not be appreciated by any modern Muslim.

                            Do not get carried away in your sympathy for Charlie Hebdo.  While we all deplore attacks of that nature, it must be pointed out that hurting religious sensitivities is not the best option for freedom of expression of thought.  The right to question a religious viewpoint or established precedent is quite distinct from dishonoring the tradition and insulting the practices and faiths of a particular religion.  Crossing this fine line is as deplorable as the retaliation in the nature we have witnessed.

                            Under the mask of "need to be responsible", some secularists would even try to justify the killings of Charlie Hebdo staff. Sorry to say, but there needs to be a limit. What would Secular parties say if Hindus went on killing PK director, producer, story and dialog writter and the film actors? Sick...

                            Siddharth, Indian media and cinema are very good at targetting the sections who limit their opposition to protests. They will never target the people who will take people's lives if media exceeds the limit. Either Muslim liberals are fooling themselves or others. Everyday, untoward incidents happen because of Muslim militants. So called Hindu liberals will not talk about it and Muslim liberals talk about how the religion is misinterpreted. How much time will this go on before some Indian journalist has the guts to call spade a spade and probably lose the lives like what happened to Charlie Hebdo?

                            We already have many Charlie Hebdos in India. We just don't have any masked gunmen of our own. And don't worry, we'll get one very soon by looking at the politics being played here by politicians, self righteous screaming TV hosts, armchair intellectuals.

                            While I do not support the French-killings (and am not a Muslim), "freedom of press" cannot be used as an excuse to ridicule everything under the sun. The right path lies in learning from other's shortcomings and improving ourselves in those respects, not ridiculing others (with those shortcomings). How many times have you tolerated someone ridiculing your parents (or other dear ones) on your face? Ridiculing should never be allowed because it invokes feelings of hatred. Yes, messages can be passed, opinions can be expressed but a sensible person is able to do that (and provoke thoughts) without resorting to cheap ridiculing. The above article is simply your opinion, which is not necessarily the right one.

                            Mr. Bhatia, it's tolerance , which has lived and will out live the society of religion, you think this wouldn't have happened if the cartoons were not there, it would have , it's happening right now , PK protests were blown out of proportions, we know why, it's still condemned but can we just condem what happened in Paris, has the religion become so weak, that it cannot tolerate expression, extremism has taken over expression .

                            I congratulate Siddharth for being consistent in contrast to all those  pseudo-liberals who were up-in-arms (AK 47 included) to defend Maqbool Fida Hussain when he drew semi-nude paintings of Hindu Godesses, but are now qualifying their "criticism" with a lots of "ifs and buts".<br/>
Mani Shankar Aiyar has infact gone a step ahead and claims that it is a "blow-back" against "Fight against terrorism".<br/>

                            Firstly Indian Media especially English press need to be non partisan in practice. English Media did not have blogs , debates on conversions from Hindu Religion in last 60 years. But it has got huge problems with Ghar Vapasi. This is double standard. And there are up teen such examples.

                            I fully agree with the author and his arguments on freedom of expression. What happened is definitely needs strong condemnation from all specially from Muslims, as violence and attacking unarmed person is not allowed in Islam. However at the same breath I suggest that, a person fighting for the cause of Freedom of Expression should also respect other people's Freedom of his/her way of life.<br/><br/>
There should be some sensibilities and respect to the fellow human beings.Just to keep some people happy for political or non political reason and entertained, Freedom of Expression should not be used to insult or repeatedly provoke some one else, as his/her Freedom to remain peaceful is affected or destroyed.<br/><br/>
As there are no laws in the world which can punish the culprits who indulges knowingly provoking and insulting some people or their faith, hence restrain to be adopted by all parties involved. In my personal opinion and as per Islamic philosophy, restrain to be practiced by Muslims and other offending parties for all kinds of provocations whether insulting or non-insulting type so that the provoking party does not commit similar act next time.<br/><br/>
It is to be remembered that Prophet Mohammed had tolerated much more insults, provocations and humiliations during his life, without even reacting or even praying to God to take revenge on his behalf, rather always he prayed to God to bestow him with patience to tolerate such situations as well as prayed to God to forgive the offender as he might be doing offensive acts in ignorance.<br/><br/>
If Prophet Mohammed could himself tolerate all the nonsense and practiced restrain, who are we ? as a follower of Islam and Prophet Mohammed, we do not have right to react violently and damage the peaceful nature of Islam. It is very clear that Islamophoic community allover the world wait to celebrate these occasions as they get a pretext to throw more abuse and accusations against Islam and start chain reaction of more provocation.<br/><br/>
A true Muslim.

                            Don't mix up Indian matter with France. PK needs to be banned because it is not really made secular but was totally in bias to minority religions. I wouldn't have mind if movie was made only to address fake swamis .. PK was made to show bad in all the religions but highlighted only fake swamis.. Why ? In present days worst violence is there in Islam religion but preferred to target Hindu religion because we are soft targets.. !!

Please come out to the road and see whats happening in daily life. People are making fun of these activists, journalists, politicians and fake secularists at one shot. But main stream media doesnt like it and doesnt want such happiness in people. But people are smart and continue to make fun of MSM and high-profile-self-proclaimed intellects as well as "I am you savior" politicians and religious outfits alike.

                            While satire is certainly enjoyable I do not agree with the author that any interpretation is ok because it is his or her opinion. if they had highlighted a burning issue, an injustice something like that I understand why the line had to be crossed but I just cannot understand the reason for doing such cartoons (irrespective of the religion) just as pure spite.<br/>
I condone the actions of those involved in the atrocity but I am also against the so called concept of free speech as envisaged by the intelligentsia.<br/>
Everyone in life tempers their speech and actions, needlessly offending anyone without any cause is just not on.

                            Mr Bhatia, I cannot entirely agree with you. I do not want to comment on other religions but I have a problem with what you say about Ramayana, for example. " Which is the authentic version?" is a worrying question. While I can understand freedom of expression is not something that should be strait jacketed, we must be careful to ensure that the scriptures are not replicated in such a way that the very essence and genuineness are jeopardised.The Vedas and Upanishads were created with a purpose - they have stood the test of time because of the robustness of what they teach. It is up to the subsequent generations whether they want to read them or not. But, under the garb of 'freedom of expression', if we end up depriving posterity of the some of the most exquisite and erudite teachings put together by geniusesm that would be a shame. While any civilised person would lustily denounce the mindless violence of Paris, it would not harm  to have a broad framework within which the third estate can operate. We can thus ensure justice to both.

                            What India needs is its own backbone. Stop jumping and rolling over, over international incidents. Where do people like you hide the rest of the time? This is the first time in seeing your blog in 5 years.

                            India does not need a Charlie hebdo - it misuses freedom of speech and media. And it has not contributed to peace and harmony instead it has instigated hate and violence among faiths, which has led to this state of affairs<br/>
We are not fooled anymore - therefore those asking for a charie hebdo in India want to create religious hate. <br/>
We need religious harmony and peace

                            The indian charlie hebdo would be smashed to powder by our 'tolerant public 'the moment it dares to print a single word.. And what's left of it will be persecuted by the government for outraging religious sentiments (IPC section 295A).. indian society is too immature to allow free speech.. Repressive blasphemy laws don't help too..

                            Well written! Though let us not forget Charlie is dead and Amir Khan is NOT even close to dead. And I for one like it that way. We are better people. If anything, we should take the message of PK and improve ourselves. Express displeasure, if that, but keep improving. If we behave the same as them, then we are as bad as them.

                            it can not be accepted to criticise a religion because of some of its follower's activity. There are many good hearted people who belive in those religion.

                            Sidharth Bhatia is absolutely right.. India needs its own Charlie Hebdo.  We are now seeing the political correctness madness !!  When will someone show the courage to start a Charlie Hebdo in India ????????????

                            Kalashnikov one side and Hindu showing flag is same for few thinkers... Btw I haven't wasted my money on pk yet simply because I don't like one sided preaching.

                            While writing about the right of the media to go beyond political correctness, Mr. Bhatia falls in the same trap. Wanting to sound objective and even-handed, he fails to see the forest for the trees. Instead of focusing on the issue of terrorism, the author deems it fit to equate it with those protesting against PK. Protest cannot be equated with murder of people whose point of view doesn't go well with you. If anything, in the Indian context, the author could have said something about the offer made by the former BSP leader who has offered a RS. 51 crore reward for the perpetrators of the death of 12 persons.

                            India has its fair share of fundamentalists; I am talking about the Gandhi parivar fundamentalists.  Say anything against that parivar and you will have the likes of Jairam Ramesh, Tiwari, Mani Shankar Aiyer, Anand Sharma, Ambika Soni and Renuka Choudhury pouring into the streets and retaliating.  You only have to look at the body language of Choudhury and hear the tone of Aiyar to realise that we do have our own problems to deal with.  In West Bengal we have a similar problem with the Jihadi Didi.  Say anything against her and O'Brien will, like the Rottweiler he is, attack you.  There would seem to be no room for constructive criticism.  It is only a question of time before that dreadful parivar is elevated to the status of Mohammed.  Thank God, India too has its own version of Charlie Ebdo employees who will stand up to the fundamentalists and pay any price for that freedom.

                            Specify your rampage against PK. It was not murder or a suicide bomb attack. It was a protest. Peaceful protest also comes under freedom of expression and not only journalism. If people would have just protested in front of Chalie Hebdo office, there would not no news and no shock.

                            Total allegiance and I concur on every bit of the opinion. Lincoln once said "a bit of revolution every now and then keeps democracy strong and fresh'. Poking incurs tolerance in society.

                            "In fact, what India needs right now is its own Charlie Hebdo." In India, its easier said than done... India is too subservient to the religious sentiments to allow it. <br/>
Indian media has not even described the controversial cartoons let alone print them. India, sadly, does not have robust implementation of laws or the protections it is required to provide for Freedom of Speech/Expression. The constitution may have it but in the real world they are non-existent. Moreover, socially, India is still perpetually genuflecting to the political and religious diaspora rather than see their own exploitation.

                            There are several tools for challenging practices and beliefs. Satire is a better one. Blessed are those who have the such gifts.
