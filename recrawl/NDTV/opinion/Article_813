Headline::::The Importance of Nitish Kumar



DateTime::::2015-10-26T15:09:00+05:30




                                As the Mahagathbandhan (the Great Alliance) rounds into the last lap of the Bihar Marathon, Nitish Kumar has given an interview to The Economic Times that tellingly delineates the emerging architecture of Opposition politics at the national level and, therefore deserves wider consideration than it has perhaps received.
 
First, he says, "anti-Congressism is dead". That is a remarkable observation coming from one who cut his political teeth in the JP movement of the mid-70s that led to the Emergency. Notwithstanding the ignominious collapse of the Janata Party within three years of its being formed, through much of the last 40 years, the Congress has remained the focus of Opposition politics. Now it is becoming the focal point of Opposition politics. For while the Congress has faded out of power in most states, it still remains the only opposition party with a widespread if thinning national presence. It is in acknowledgement of the continuing relevance of the Congress to confronting the BJP juggernaut that the Mahagathbandhan has provided space for the Congress to contest as many as 40 seats in the on-going Bihar elections, about half of which the Congress seems to be on the verge of winning.
 
That leads to Nitish Kumar's second eye-catching observation: "Rahul Gandhi is the top leader in the Congress". He adds, "I do not see any immaturity in him...I do not find him lacking clarity on issues." For Nitish to have moved away from the empty rhetoric of so-called "dynastic politics" to recognizing Rahul as his principal Congress partner in the Mahagathbandhan amounts to not only a clear-eyed view of the Congress reality, but also its acceptability as an essential component of any national alliance to oust the BJP. "Congress," Nitish underlines, "is still a political force. Today, even in its worst situation, it got 11 crore votes".
 
And the prospect of ousting the BJP is becoming clearer every day as the nation's politics moves towards the next great setback for the allegedly invincible Narendra Modi-Amit Shah duo after their Delhi disaster. 2014 is emerging as an aberration, not a trend. Says Nitish of the Lok Sabha election, the outcome was the consequence of general disillusionment with UPA II and division in the ranks of the non-BJP parties. The anti-UPA sentiment is already becoming history while the non-BJP Opposition has begun to learn the advantages of closing ranks. Thus, 2014 is turning out to be "a one-time affair. They mistook it for all time".
Finding the tide running against them, the RSS-BJP is back to its traditional mode of divisive communalization. "They kept trying to carry out their agenda of polarization. They called our government a pro-Muslim government, not a secular government". This has been the time-tested technique of the Sangh Parivar - claim to be secular on the surface while digging to widen the divide below. It is a political technology that has had sporadic but never sustained success; yet, that being the basic ideology of the Hindutva forces, sooner than later they find refuge in such seeking to survive through divide and rule.
 
Nitish observes, "Sarkar bana lena saral hai, desh chalana mushkil (It is easy to form the government, difficult to govern the country)". 500 days of slogan-mongering by the Modi government have shown that alliteration, acronyms and jumlas are not enough; there has to be delivery. But where there has been assiduous image-building, there has been little effective governance. Old schemes have been renamed and trotted out as new, but there is a complete want of imagination in giving substance to the Modi brand. Despite a very favourable external economic environment, symbolized by the sharp drop in oil prices by nearly $100 a barrel from the peak they attained when the UPA was in office, the rupee today wallows at its worst ever exchange rate vis-a-vis the dollar, reflecting the precipitate rise in imports without any corresponding increase in exports. The spiralling price of pulses shows a complete absence of understanding of basic mass consumer requirements. Compared to the rhetoric of the Prime Minister's foreign gyrations, the results on the ground are thin to the point of disillusionment. Hugging Obama while calling him "Barak" as if he were a jigri yaar, and shedding copious tears in Mark Zuckerberg's presence make for good photo-ops but do no constitute foreign policy successes.
 
That is why there is a pattern to their promoting "communal polarization," as Nitish says, "by resorting to small ones" when they cannot "carry out a big incident". That is why Dadri and Modi's deafening silence, followed (and that too only once) by a hollow muted response "latching on to the President's statement", in the face of repeated outrageous statements by his own MPs and MLAs, ministers at the centre and the states, assorted party colleagues and RSS cadres has resulted in Dadri having a "national and international impact". If there were not a strategic meaning to all this, the impact of Dadri could have been contained instead of spinning out into a number of related incidents, such as the murder of two young Dalits being followed by central minister V.K. Singh's offensive comparison of the brutal killings to a stone being cast at a stray dog.
Nitish points out that it is wrong to consider incidents like Dadri "merely as a law and order problem". He says, "No matter what your ideological background is, the moment you swear to uphold the constitution, your role should be guided by it." Yet, Modi failed to see (or deliberately blinded himself to it) that far from being a matter for a Superintendent of Police to deal with, this required the PM to understand that "our country is so diverse that you have to be sensitive to it" and as PM recognize the "atmosphere of distrust being created in our society". That is what "raj dharma" is all about.
 
It is on reservations, an issue stirred in the cauldron of Bihar's current election by none less than Mohan Bhagwat, that Nitish shows himself at his perceptive best. He points out that "reservation is not meant to address the issue of economic backwardness." For that "there are several schemes that can be run. No one will have a problem with that. The poor belong to all castes." Where reservation comes into its own "is to give a feeling of equal importance. For centuries you have been on the margins and reservation is to tell you that you are no longer on the fringes but in mainstream society". What Lalu achieved during his long innings, says Nitish, was in giving "disadvantaged groups the feeling that they could run a government. Those who were not allowed to speak could make themselves heard."
 
It is such clarity over social and economic issues, and the key importance of secularism in our scheme of things, that make Nitish the formidable contender he is not only in the limited context of the Bihar elections but in the larger context of the future evolution of our national polity. He is proving himself a leader of not just state relevance but of national importance.    (Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            This article is exactly what is wrong with Congress. First of all, dynastic politics, sycophancy and chamchagiri. He even justifies Rahul Gandhi. Lastly, the ignominy of accepting Congress as a junior and justifying it competing less than 20% of seats in Bihar.

Your real intention seeems to be to rub some salt into into the poor man's wounds!!!

Yu see Mani, it is this kind of politics by Congress which has led it to where it is today. The people of this country today are becoming more educated Mani, we are no longer your illiterate captive vote bank

                            Mani the moron, true to form, is at his sycophantic best.  Just because Nitish gives his hero Rahul a certificate of competence does not make the latter a potential PM.  Just because Nitish says that 'anti-Congressism' is dead does not make it so.  After all, it is the same Nitish who stabbed NDA in the back and thought he had the nation's pulse right just after Modi's elevation by the BJP.  He was wrong then and he is wrong now!  Nitish also got the appointment of Jetan Ram Manjhi wrong and he himself apologised for that!  Mani the moron should not be speaking for Nitish if the latter is the great politician that he is made out to be!  After all, a great politician does not really need the services of a 74 year old 'has been' babu like Mani the moron!  As for Modi's camaraderie with the likes of Barak and Mark Zukerberg, this is suggestive that only the Gandhis are entitled to exercise such qualities as mere chaiwallas must know their places in Mani the moron's hierarchy in India.  Mani the moron should know that those of us who do not regard the Italian waitress and her offspring as worthy of succeeding to the highest political post in the land have long memories.  If he thinks his party, by disrupting parliament has made India ungovernable, wait until you see what happens should Rahul ever succeed!  Incidentally, why no mention of the principled Nitish or for that matter the Italian waitress reaching an alliance with the convicted fraudster Lalu.  Lalu carried out industrial scale theft from the nation.  Perhaps that is mere routine for Mani the moron!  After all, his hero Rajiv stashed away the Borfors funds, his ally A Raja stashed away even more from 2G, his Congresswalla Veer Bhadra Singh has a mysterious apple orchard producing crores of rupees from a couple of apple trees and the nation's damad Vadra would regard Lalu as a mere junior when it comes to industrial scale fraud.  I guess Mani the moron thinks we do not realise that Nitish is being groomed to be PM with little Rahul in the background controlling matters just as the Italian waitress did by putting in power a cadaver called Manmohan Singh!

                            Enemy's enemy is my friend is slogan by which the Congress lives on. It has entrenched itself so well in the country over the last so many decades that it cannot be driven away. It is like  a cancer which cannot be treated  until the patient dies. The Mahagathbandhan is like group of Kauravas out to kill Abhimanyu (BJP). And our Mani is the typical Chanakya.

Hope you know the answer then any one else.... and you said half of the seats which now got by cong will win (40/2=20).. I think what we mean is half of the present seats (4/2=2)...That is fair number as per cong in Bihar.

                            Mr Aiyar: I agree a lot with what you say and have nothing but the utmost respect for an erudite, articulate man like you. But yet, I find it unfathomable that you or anyone else would regard Rahul van Winkle as leadership material. The man does not want to don the mantle of leadership that is being thrust upon him; he does not wish to wear the crown that is being forced to inherit. He vanishes when there are crises,  cf. his disappearances after the electoral rout last year and the long "chintan" where he was presumably lost in some black hole. Compared to say a Shashi Tharoor or even you Mr Aiyar, Rahul Gandhi is a weak, inarticulate, unelectable intellectual lightweight. Not that Indian politics throws up heavyweights of any kind. Rahul Gandhi is the Congress equivalent of Azhagiri, or Stalin ! He is someone who has inherited something he does not want and hence must find another profession. No amount of shielding or justifications of his stance or newspaper articles by you Mr Aiyar can change this fundamental fact.  He may be a decent chap and all that but he is not a leader and is certainly not leadership material. And does not want the job either. Yo can bring a horse to the water but you can't make him drink !

                            @Mohd Amaah: Completely agree with you mate. Aiyar seems to have conveniently forgotten that the same Nitish Kumar was in partnership with the supposedly communal BJP until he allowed his ego to get the better of him. As for Lalu's 'clarity on social and economic issues', one wonders where it went when law and order and administrative structures in Bihar collapsed completely under his watch.<br/><br/>
And as usual, Mani Shankar Aiyar hasn't mentioned the Bhagalpur riots, which is the main reason why the Congress is reduced to a junior partner in Bihar. For the record, about 1,000 Muslims were massacred in those riots (with Congress then in power in Bihar and at the centre). The victims went through Congress and Lalu rule without justice until Nitish Kumar (in partnership with BJP!) came along.

You people still not understanding " why mandate of people went against Congress all over nation " . Still you are trying to save Rahul who does not know to address the people and you people are afraid of Mr. Modi because what he is doing or done in short period, you have not done in 60 years.<br/>
Therefore donot try to mould the actual situation with Nitish and Laloo and try to face the public as Modi is doing.

Firstly, if Nitish seriously doesn't find Rahul immature then Nitish himself is immature!<br/><br/>
Second, if he is lying about Rahul's immaturity to keep Congress in good humour then it just shows what a vile politician he is - coming from JP's movement to forming an alliance with the people behind the emergency.

This how congress started vote bank politics,and also during Sonia as party president Christian card also played by letting the churches a day missionaries conversions in the country on vetican's influence as she belongs to Italy and Roman catholic,she is not and never Indian but she is Italian and Roman catholic by heart and blood.

Out of that he thinks of winning 20 which he calls satisfactory performance. If he had such a confidence in Rahul  baba why didn't they contest all seats? Rahul is a zero leader still Congress is holding on to him. He is calling Nitish a leader of national importance as Congress is totally impotent and can't produce anything. It is worth laughing that Nitish calls Rahul top and  mature leader and Mani is so happy about it.They are latching on incidents like Dadri and dog remarks. No talk of any development. God save Bihar.

                            That Mani had to state that Congressism is not dead and that Rahul Gandhi is the he most important leader in the Congress is his political compulsion to remain relevant in his own party. That a party of Nehru and Gandhi is reduced to riding the coat tails of Nitish's and Lalu's parties just to survive shows the true political compulsions of our times. The rallying  force is not progress but anti-BJPism that has replaced decades of anti-Congressism. After repeated attempts to project Rahul Gandhi as a leader of national status, and failing miserably in these attempts, it appears that Congress is now reconciled to accepting any leader from outside who agrees to provide a crutch to a feeble and antiquated party with no hope of revival.

                            This is an articleby  Mani who hails from a Muslim dominated constituency in Tamilnadu where he was defeated  for his secular slogans. He is right when he says that the cong led govt was considered to be run by Muslims as they were trying to appease the community for the sake of votes for about more then 5 decades. They realised the dirty game of being used as pawns by cong to enjoy power and thru power loot the nation.2 ndly he feels that 500 days in office , NDA hAs not done anything in spite of nosediving of oil prices. The schemes which any govt in power should do was planned under cong rule also but the fact is they kept them as announcements but never bothered to implement as It was nonperforming govt especially in the period from2004...14 coupled with unheard level of corruption under a PM who was totally dumb&amp; blind.this was 2nd reason for their utter defeat . The most important point that is indirectly accepted by Mani is that in future cong can never contest elections of its own and requiring support of unreliable leaders like Nithish, and partys of similar dyanastic &amp; highly corrupt  like RJD,SP, DMK etc . Now it is for people of Bihar to wake up to these realities and vote BJP for good governance and teach a lesson to Cunning Nithishkumar .

                            First thing every congressmen has to accept is Congress party is facing serious existential crisis all over the country. If this trend continues, they will have to fight 2019 general elections under the banner of "secular" no-brainers who has the strength on the ground in their respective states. Recent election results in Leh-Ladak region should ring the alarm bells in the Congress party headquarters.  Now if it doesn't, then all the Congressmen would be living in a banana republic dreaming about a non-inspiring Rahul Gandhi is good for our nation but NOT for Congressmen. People like Mani, has to stop living in denial. Here is a party which claims it is national, fighting under JD(U) and RJD and no one talks about Congress party at all. So what does this explain ? It is obvious that Congressmen don't like BJP but they have a serious problem to address it in their home ground before they talk on BJP. Now talking about JD(U), here is a party which won 119 seats in the last election and today they are contesting 100 seats ?? What kind of logic is this ? Similarly RJD won ~ 25 seats last time and now they are contesting 100 seats ??? Congress party won 4 seats last time and now they are contesting 40 seats ?? The weakest link in this coalition is Congress party and RJD. Its not a surprise NAMO targeting Lalu Yadav all the time in his rallies. I personally think the voters of BJP and JD(U) are anti-Congress and anti-RJD and anti-Jungle Raaj..! Now in the areas where JD(U) is contesting against BJP, i would definitely agree the same set of voters for BJP and JD(U) will split but just think of other 140 seats ???? We would have to wait for November 8th before jumping to the conclusion on giving Nitish a certificate. I would guess it would be a very close contest the winning party will be around 10-15 seats higher than the loosing party. On the side note, i think people like Manishankar should really think to work on their local constituencies rather than living in the virtual world vomiting non-sense on BJP.

Congress has now become reactive opposition party, I believe it should be proactive opposition party so that it can bring new ideas and propel govt towards constructive thoughts. But that is a far fetched idea as the way I hear some prominent congress leaders they don't speak on how they can make this country a better place but they only play blame game, disruption and divide and rule politics.

Less he talk better for the congress and for him because whenever he criticizes somebody  it will work pro for opposite party. Nitish kumar who has been till recently with BJP - a party considered by them as non secular and he split with BJP because he didnt want Modi to become PM as he wants his good friend Advani to become PM. So at the behest of Advani he revolted against Modi thinking that BJP leader will fear loosing an allei and stop considering Modi for PM position. Unfortunately everything boomeranged on him

                            Manishankar, I think the importance/value of your opinion has gone to the bottom because instead of giving an "opinion" you try to form an "opinion" for congress which has gone to stormy winds and soon sink into the deep sea of irrelevance/rejection. Be grateful to People for they at-least read your non-sense everytime and keep your publicity alive negatively. Thats what you try for? Isnt it?

                            Mani for once spoke truth - may be by accident<br/>
Quote<br/>
"What Lalu achieved during his long innings, says Nitish, was in giving "disadvantaged groups the feeling that they could run a government. Those who were not allowed to speak could make themselves heard."<br/>
Unquote.<br/>
By the above - Mani admits that the congress governments that ruled Bihar before Lalu have suppressed the poor and marginalized. Only a JP inspired Lalu could undo what decades of congress rule did to the poor.<br/>
Great going Mani. Spill more such truths.
