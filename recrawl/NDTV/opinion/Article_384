Headline::::How PM has Sidelined Sushma Swaraj Again



DateTime::::2015-01-29T20:02:00+05:30



(Siddharth Varadarajan is a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Public Affairs and Critical Theory, Shiv Nadar University)If Narendra Modi is the most powerful Prime Minister that India has had since Rajiv Gandhi or Indira Gandhi, S Jaishankar, the man he has just brought in as Foreign Secretary, will be the most powerful diplomat the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has seen in decades.Jaishankar, who was until yesterday India's Ambassador to the United States, brings to the office of the Foreign Secretary not just vast experience in dealing with three world powers - the US, China and Russia - and fierce competence, but also an ability to relate to Modi in ways that the Foreign Ministry's traditional bureaucracy has so far failed to do.  What makes his hand even stronger than that of his illustrious predecessors - Shivshankar Menon, Shyam Saran, JN Dixit, Muchkund Dubey, Salman Haider, MK Rasgotra and RD Sathe - is the Prime Minister's style of dealing directly with key bureaucrats, bypassing their own ministerial bosses in the process. Despite her seniority and experience as a politician and administrator, Sushma Swaraj is arguably the least empowered External Affairs Minister since Bali Ram Bhagat headed the MEA way back in the 1980s. While the weight of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) in foreign policy decision-making has steadily increased since Atal Bihari Vajpayee's days, never before has the Foreign Minister been so marginalized. Her confidence shaken, she has given no interviews as External Affairs Minister and agreed only to very limited interaction with Delhi's legion of diplomatic correspondents. When a reporter asked her for a soundbite soon after a Pakistani court granted bail to Lashkar terrorist Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi, Sushma baulked, saying the Prime Minister would react first. Most importantly, Sushma is not a member of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet and thus was not even party to Jaishankar's appointment. The tersely-worded order ending the run of the incumbent, Sujatha Singh, when she still had seven months to go bore the imprimatur of just Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh.In terms of rules, the "curtailment of tenure" announced on Wednesday night is entirely the government's (ie Modi's) prerogative. It was only as recently as 2010 that the government decided to add the Foreign Secretary to the list of key officials - Defence Secretary, Home Secretary, and the heads of the Intelligence Bureau and the Research & Analysis Wing - who would be eligible for a two-year term regardless of when they turned 60 and thus retired from the civil service. Inherent in the rule is the government's power to shorten this tenure at will if it feels the "public interest" is served by doing so. While Singh has done nothing on which she can be faulted, she has become a casualty of Modi's highly- personalised style of functioning. Key policy approaches to different countries -- eg. Nepal, Japan and the US, which he has visited - have been worked out by Modi directly after one-on-one meetings with the Indian ambassadors to those countries and key bureaucrats. Sushma Swaraj and the Foreign Secretary were brought into the picture much later. Sometimes, important decisions like the cancellation of talks with Pakistan were taken by Modi on the spur of the moment, without consulting even the envoy concerned. Ironically, Modi's relations with Sujatha Singh soured almost from day one when he received negative feedback from Pakistan about the 'hawkish' way she had answered questions about his meeting with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Soon after, instructions were reportedly sent that Singh should no longer field questions in press conferences and leave that task to the desk officers concerned. MEA insiders say this was unfair, and that in the absence of clear instructions from Modi, Singh had no option but to stick to India's official position in responding to questions on terrorism even if this meant discomfiting Nawaz somewhat. According to PMO officials, the PM was impressed by Jaishankar's handling of his US visit last year, including the Madison Square Garden event where he delegated the organising to him after spelling out the broad parameters. Indian diplomats present during that visit say Jaishankar's rapport with Modi was obvious. Where MEA officials in Delhi found themselves snubbed when they tried to offer the PM advice, Jaishankar reportedly struck a chord. His apparent suggestion that Modi not use phrases like  "Make in India" and "Asian Century" while in America, since both had a negative connotation in the US, is said to have been welcomed by the Prime Minister. Because of this personal connect, Jaishankar's appointment will help Modi move his foreign policy from the management of bilateral visits - which is essentially what it has been so far -- to a broader strategic plane. In Manmohan Singh's time, that role was played by Shivshankar Menon, first as Foreign Secretary and then as National Security Adviser. Ajit Doval may be Modi's NSA now, but it is his lack of foreign policy experience and his inability to move beyond the 'tactical' that had created a void which Jaishankar will now fill. His inclusion in Modi's team is good news for Modi, and for India. It is a pity that the only way the Prime Minister found to bring him on board was to render an injustice to Sujatha Singh.

                            Was just wondering why the title of the post was changed. When it was first published, it had a more positive title. However, for some strange reason a more negative title has replaced it while the post body has remained the same.<br/>
Please give credit where it is due, just because it is done by the current government, don't try to paint it with a negative brush all the time.

                            Sujatha Singh was given enough time to resign (approx. more than 30 days) when the rediff article by Sheela Bhatt was released. She didn't do it, may be because of Obama's visit or other reasons. Jaishankar is due to retire on Jan 31. Without this appointment, his work continuity would have lost. Sujatha Singh is just replaced. She didn't lost her employment. So "injustice" piece by the American Sid is a way to find fault in every Modi government decision (because he is yet to make peace with Modiji's election).

                            The author is the classic example of a news trader who tries to create rift between PM and his council of ministers. Sujata was appointed during congress regime, and allegedly due to her family's congress connections (Her dad was appointed governor under UPA) purely based on seniority rather than merit. It was the magnanimity of NDA that she was allowed to continue for so long, despite change in government. UPA used to summarily change offcials as soon as they came to power. But the NDA has outdone itself by appointing a person with merit like Mr Jaishankar. <br/>
The author has a history of making unsubstantiated allegations. He tried to cast aspersions on the coast guard, when it successfully interrupted a Pakistani terror boat that destroyed itself rather than surrender. <br/><br/>
I hope NDTV will carefully vet the stories and differentiate stories and opinions before publishing them.

                            In the morning when I read the article, its headline was "How Modi's Trust was Won by S Jaishankar". This headline did not have any negative tone about PM Modi. However, the current headline of the very same article bears a negative tone for the Modi government. Why was the headline changed to portray the government and PM Modi in somewhat negative light. As many people have themselves argued, MEA has lost its relevance for many years, PMO has a greater say. So if earlier we had a PM who we hear had high regard for Jaishankar but probably wasn't strong enough to get the people he wanted, it was his fault not the current PM's. The change of headline gives me enough signals about the prejudices of some people running this website.  Maybe Siddharth had something not very negative to say about Modi this time, but someone probably had other ideas. NDTV should publish this comment if they have any shred of journalistic dignity left.

                            Siddhu cannot resist himself. He has to discredit Modi at the first available opportunity. Unfortunately in this case, it came at the fag end. "Injustice" Mr Varadarajan? Did you even know that way back in 2013 Manmohan Singh had wanted to appoint Jaishankar as FS? It was Sonia Gandhi, the de facto PM who prevailed on the de jure PM and made sure Sujatha Singh was anointed as FS. Reason? The latter's father was a loyal Congressman. Nepotism at its best, uh? So Jaishankar was far more capable than Ms Singh even back then. Let us not talk about injustice: she warmed a seat which she did not deserve for more than 15 months.

                            Well written but we Indian complain oflack of leader is real life and when we get one we fail to recognise one. Modi is a leader and think he likes to address matter directly. In such case it is not that minister concerned play a second fiddle but has to conform to leaders wishes- to coopertae -to smoothen things out and to take India ahead.<br/>
We dont need mud slinging we have seen enough of it in the past. That was acceptable in coalition politcs but now we have given him a mandate and he is performing let is learn to accept<br/><br/>

                            The dynasty congress paid media always trying to float the cause to talk against the BJP government. First thing is that Modi is not only most powerful PM, but the most popular and aam admi PM India ever produced. He is the person not promoted by and person or family. Nehru was promoted by Mahatma Gandhi and the subsequent PMs of Nehru family were there because of the dynasty family. Modi has come through open age of media where as all dynasty PMs had come where presence of media was almost zero. So it is malicious to compere Modi with the dynasty PMs.

                            After reading so many news and blogs on this issue, I conclude Jaishankar is a real eligible person for the task, but govt should have waited for another 7 months for completion of Ms. Singh's tenure. May be govt had some other plans that they could not wait even for 7 months. Don't know.

                            BJP won 2014 election because of the effort and ideas of Modi and choosing someone as a leader mean to follow his lead and carry forward with it.Since Modi is new as Prime-minister which is a much daunting task than a chief-minister of a state with added responsibilities. He is in initial phase guiding and laying the foundation of BJP policies and leading from the front and later when he laid down the foundation then the respective ministries will follow his foot path or carried the policies forward.Since he won because of major public majority and popularity if some harsh decision were taken by his colleague like for example Susma Swaraj she will be in the firing line of opposition,media and common people, for their sake Modi is first line of defense taking all the initial fires or brunt.

                            This new style of media has too much time on their hands, they start making up gossip to feed to gullible masses. As they say, idle mind is a devils workshop, you can see this in the countless useless debates and "breaking news". Something has to be done with this lying media.

                            Modi alone cannot correct India. he needs people, good people-he got Goa CM,now new FS and many unknown good folks to his company to give good governance to Ind. Democracy cannot work for Ind anymore and we need such force to get good folks. what to do.. no choice..

                            Sujata, a confident of Sonia, could not be expected to be loyal to the present govt. and we need efficient people in every dept. of the country.

                            These are strategic govt decisions. If Sushma Swaraj is appearing weak, it's her fault, not Modi's way of working. Every Leader has their own way of working. Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos are known to be way more harsh in their decision making.

                            Mr Varadharajan, since when did you become a sympathizer of Sushma Swaraj or anything remotely BJP....? Did not ever see any article from you all the past 10 years when even the highest office in the country - that of Prime Minister Mr. Manmohan Singh was severely undermined by all and sundry from the Indira Khan's and Robert Vadra families...

                            An insightful article. Was this not expected ? This Is the new style that  17 crore voters preferred &amp; voted for. This is the style that makes these 17 crore citizens feel enpowered. Cutting down hierarchies, demolishing age old institutions, disdain for party workers &amp; seniors - a vote for "Ache Din". Ask the bureaucracy in Gujarat - tales galore. And this is just the beginning !!!!! I Urge the media - " stop the descent &amp; start the dissent". Keep it rolling......

                            Does Modi know what is he doing? Has anyone asked this fundamental question?Nepal,BD,SL,Maldives and Af-Pak in turmoil.Middle east on fire,Europe in economic slide and Russia and China's reaction to relation with US, we have no foreign minister. Ditto Amit Shah in national politics kicking out loyalists.His obsession with publicity and lack of foreign affairs understanding worries anyone?Amit Shah's stupidity will take country and BJP down! Beware!

                            This author in spite of his Ivy League education, plays petty politics. He is not a citizen of India but dabbles in Indian politics. Such a shame that he does not understand that the present PM is not cast in the mold of this author's fancy dreams. Those readers who like his style of writing need to understand that he has an agenda - left leaning. So he will convert every argument to bait and bash Modi. His interests are more aligned to China and Russia than India.

                            Siddharth is so sad for Shusma. Why is he biased towards Shusma and not Modi? Has he got an agenda?<br/>
I am awaiting Mani's learned article now.

                            Dear Sidharth, <br/><br/>
Focus on your own life to make it better. <br/>
This country is now in safe hands and you will see changes in country next 5 Years with Modi.<br/>
Stop being a agent of opposition.

                            As per the author, "His inclusion in Modi's team is good news for India."<br/>
That is the bottom line.
