Headline::::For Our Children: Powerful Editorial in Pak Daily



DateTime::::2014-12-17T19:26:00+05:30



This article was first published on  thenation.com.pk.16 December 2014 is one of the worst days Pakistan has had to live through since its inception. This national tragedy, which has caused unimaginable grief and pain across the landscape, will not and must not be forgotten anytime soon. Muhammad Khorasani of Jamat-ul-Ahrar, also known as Omer Khorasani, of the Jamat-ul-Ahrar, a faction of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan led by Mullah Fazlullah, has accepted responsibility for the attack on the school. In his statement given to the media, the militant commander termed the attack as retaliation for the ongoing military operation in FATA.Some say that at a time like this, it is not wise and appropriate to blame the government or state institutions. Such a tragedy calls for unity, and criticism doesn't help to achieve that purpose. But no consensus can be built, no wrong can be corrected, no problem can be solved by deciding against speaking the truth. And the truth is this: Not just terrorists, but everyone, from the wider population to the civil and military leadership is responsible for the barbarity our children were subjected to.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, your government has contributed absolutely nothing towards building a narrative against extremism. Operation Zarb-e-Azb started without your permission, and it continues absent meaningful political ownership. You have refused to act against seminaries funded through Saudi money, which are poisoning the minds of our youth and turning them into zealots. Instead of putting them behind bars, the Punjab government protects sectarian elements as they return the favour by not attacking you and taking out rallies in your support.Chairman Imran Khan, you are the most mainstream and consistent Taliban sympathiser in the country. Despite the murder of 132 children in the capital of the province where your party is in power, you couldn't muster the courage to name the Taliban. You have done a great disservice to this nation by repeatedly justifying the murder of your fellow countrymen and pushing a toxic narrative based on factual inaccuracies and ignorance.Chief of Army Staff General Raheel Sharif, despite all that has happened, despite the many sacrifices of the brave soldiers who have died fighting terrorists, you refuse to employ a blanket policy against non-state actors. While the military conducts operations against bad Taliban in FATA, it continues to protect sectarian elements in Quetta, the Afghan Taliban and other 'jihadi' organisations such as Jamat-ud-Dawa. The country is reaping what it has sown over decades.Citizens, you seek comfort in conspiracy theories to avoid facing the ugly truth. What will it take for you to unite against extremism unequivocally and without provisos?The idea is not to berate or discourage, but to offer a reality check and prompt change of policy for the sake of our children, for the sake of our country's future. Only the truth will set us free.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Nothing will change the Pakistani mindset. India needs to stay alert and keep insulating itself from Pakistan.

                            The killing of innocent children is not denounced by any Muslim leader anywhere in the world; knowing the fact that the massacre has been done by a Muslim fundamentalist group. Recently in India one Mehdi Masroor openly declared that "In Islam killing is not a sin and every child knows this". These types of distorted views are encouraged by almost all Islamic leaders and have never raised slightest voice against this. Islam does not say this at all!!! Quran says "If a neighbor of a Muslim is unhappy with the behavior of the Muslim in question, then all the prayers of that Muslim are denied by the LORD". Such a supreme humane religion Islam is!!! Offering animals and sacrifice is a different activity. Human sacrifice is not recommended in Quran. Jihad in Quran is the battle against wrong doers. Now the question is who is wrong doer??? "WRONG DOERS" IN RELIGION DOES NOT INCLUDE "POLITICAL WRONG DOERS".  Why Muslim leaders maintain silence and allow Islam to be tarnished by Muslims through these acts is a strange mystery!!!!????

                            Those who kill children are not human. As the Taliban lose on the battlefield, as they must, they turn on those who cannot retaliate. As the article says, the wrong policies of the Pakistan government and army have come back to haunt them. Hillary Clinton had warned years ago to Pakistan that you cannot breed snakes in your backyard and expect them to bite your neighbors only. But to learn a hard lesson with the blood of your own children is beyond tragedy. But the bigger tragedy is that Pakistan will not learn its lesson even now, and after a few weeks these children will be forgotten, and the Pakistanis will be back to their business as usual. Hard to imagine that the Taliban were also students.

                            Very well written editorial with facts. Whenever there is any terrorist attack in India, Pakistan politicians, army deny their involvement inspite of providing enough proof by Indian side of their involvement. Some section of Indian society never came out openly to condemn the killings of innocent Indians. It is a known all over the world that Pakistan is a breeding ground for terrorists with full support from Pakistan Govt., Army, ISI. Pakistan is now getting what it has been the world all these years. We now see that all sections of society are condemning the killing of children. All killings are very sad and not supported but people who never condemned killings of Indians in India should ask themselves why now ? Is it because it happened in Pakistan ?<br/>
Incidents in India were blamed for Indian policy in Kashmir. Now what policy in Pakistan ? This game of ugly politics should be stopped for a better future of today's generation. We must remember - AS YOU SOW, SO YOU REAP. Pakistan should start act immediately without any delay.

                            lets face it. The cold blooded murder of Pakistani school children is a heinous crime. But pakistani people have to realise the Pakistani state has to take blame for this gruesome incident. It always follows a policy of a "good terrorist" &amp; a "bad terrorist". It nurtures terrorist organizations like the Jamaat Ud Dawa because they act against India &amp; fights the Taliban that acts against Pakistanis. As long they exercise this dual policy there are bound to be more such incidents in Pakistan. The idea that a person that kills me is a "terrorist" &amp; a person that kills you is a "freedom fighter" will continue to bleed Pakistan.

                            It is education which makes all difference...you either create persons who respect plural society and love the colors in life  or you give hate education with myths which many Pakistan's institutes are doing and love only black and red colors in life..... courtesy Jia Ulhak who simply radicalized the Pakistan. It will take at-least two generations to bring back Pakistan from the clutches of hate spreading religious education system and make it a modern state which stop producing hate spreading and red and black colors loving terrorists
