Headline::::Bravo, Aamir, for Your New Statement



DateTime::::2015-11-26T06:23:00+05:30




                                Sometime in January 2005, the BBC World, while broadcasting a three-part documentary "The Power of Nightmares" by Adam Curtis wrote something very striking about terror and politics that I had to revisit it last evening because of the uncanny similarity to the present day context.
The documentary which covered the formation of Al Qaeda, radicalism and political myth-making post 9/11, received rave reviews across the world with this description that summarised it "Should we be worried about the threat from organised terrorism or is it simply a phantom menace being used to stop society from falling apart? In the past our politicians offered us dreams of a better world. Now they promise to protect us from nightmares. The most frightening of these is the threat of an international terror network. But just as the dreams were not true, neither are these nightmares."
Two weeks ago, as the world witnessed one of the worst terror attacks in the last few years in Paris, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was on an official visit to the United Kingdom at the time, offered his condolences about Paris and reiterated later at the G-20 summit held in Turkey: "The world must speak in one voice and act in unison against terrorism, without any political considerations, we must isolate those who support and sponsor terrorism and stand with those who share our values of humanism."
ISIS is the modern-day nightmare for the world and it was only pertinent that PM Modi, like most of his contemporaries across the world, spoke for the need to eradicate radicalism.
Back home in India, lead stories of ISIS and its possible radicalisation of Indian Muslims was discussed at great lengths by writers, political outfits, some of which bordered on Islamophobia, making it sound like an ''us versus them'' battle yet again.
While PM Modi spoke of the need to delink religion from terror, somebody in the Ministry of Home Affairs and his efficient team must have surely briefed him about the domestic terror back home. That innocent dalits, tribals and other minorities were killed in the name of faith, that writers, rationalists were silenced, that those who dared to speak against the system were being threatened. This culture of intolerance and bigotry which had been seen in previous regimes was now assuming much dangerous proportions than the ISIS; a terror organisation which did not find any takers in India.
It was then very unfortunate that writers like Chetan Bhagat used the Paris attack and ISIS to mock the prevalent dialogue on intolerance. In a tweet that by his own confession got Chetan Bhagat the maximum retweets of his career, he posted: "Ok, wrong to label Islam as violent after stray terror attack, But why did you label my entire country intolerant after a few stray incidents?"
While I and many countrymen do not take the view of a self-confessed intellectual as the voice of the country and consider his bigoted view an aberration, it gave voice to what I believe is a paranoia that the country is being fueled with so as to drown the voices that have been speaking of an increasing intolerance. It is in this context that statements by senior leaders affiliated to the BJP asking Muslims to go to Pakistan should be seen and dreaded, and is for this very reason that one must give a patient and serious ear to the concern voiced by two of the country's most loved superstars, Aamir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan.
Both actors within the last one month have expressed concern over the increasing intolerance that has vitiated the secular fabric of the country; both belong to families that have played a significant role in the freedom struggle of India and are shining examples of pluralism. Yet, the two have had to face the humiliating experience of not being judged as icons and ambassadors of culture but merely as Muslim surnames.
Shah Rukh's Swades, Chak De India and Aamir's Lagaan and Mangal Pandey were a fitting tribute to the idea of India they believe in, for in India, films are one of the most important tools of shaping public opinion and discourse.
Shah Rukh has in various interviews fondly talked of his children reciting the Gayatri mantra while Aamir has in his avatar as an informed activist reiterated the need to place social justice over religion. The Khans, like many of India's biggest stars and national icons, are one of the reasons why the idea of India has continued to flourish post-independence.
India, unlike other countries, based its idea of nationhood on plurality as opposed to homogeneity. From a feudal, colonised society which had been fragmented and torn with the sword of religion, the country took giant leaps into transforming itself as a liberal, modern, progressive nation that promised equal rights and respect to all its citizens.
Aamir Khan, who was quoted at the Ramnath Goenka Awards as saying that his wife had suggested the idea of leaving the country, was using that very democratic right as a son of the soil to express his increasing apprehension about the communal colour that most sensitive issues in the country have begun to assume. Why then have we wronged Aamir Khan as a traitor when we paid glorious tributes to his award-winning film Lagaan which was based on the idea of unity in diversity while defending the British? Aamir named his son with Kiran Rao after his great grand uncle Maulana Abul Kalam Azad who was one of the shining lights in the freedom movement.
One must laud Aamir for a very sensitive and emotional message he sent to the nation after charges of sedition were filed against him in a court and FIR's lodged against him accusing him of spreading intolerance. Aamir gave a fitting reply to his detractors when he said: "First let me state categorically that neither I, nor my wife Kiran, have any intention of leaving the country. We never did, and nor would we like to in the future.
To all those people who are calling me anti-national, I would like to say that I am proud to be Indian, and I do not need anyone's permission nor endorsement for that.
To all the people shouting obscenities at me for speaking my heart out, it saddens me to say you are only proving my point".Â  He ended his statement with Rabindranath Tagore's awe-inspiring poem "Where the mind is without fear", a choice that most nationalists and patriots of the country should see as a clear message from the actor.
Aamir's colleague, Shah Rukh Khan, who is India's cultural ambassador to most countries across the world and one of India's most-loved stars, has had to face the humiliating experience of being asked by a seven-time BJP MP to relocate to Pakistan after he spoke of feeling an increasing sense of religious intolerance in the country. By attempting to stifle the voices of the two Khans, we are only giving fodder to the cynicism that many like me in the past accused the film fraternity of - that of not standing up to injustice and protecting the idea of India. Like many of my colleagues and fellow Indians, I have on many occasions called the film industry a spineless entity which refuses to stick its neck out in calling out the injustice inflicted upon those without a voice.
The idea of India propagated by those who led us to freedom needs to be reiterated and reinforced, and the prevalent culture of intolerance is proof of how urgently this is required. Toxic armies of trolls who have invaded the social media and other spaces who claim to owe allegiance to Modi, the BJP, Hindutva and a non-inclusive India are only intensifying this culture of intolerance with unreasonable accusations, misogyny, atavistic hate and religious abuse.
Prime Minister Modi is rightly concerned about the radicalisation and extremism across the world, but the domestic terror back home cannot be submerged and camouflaged using the fear of terror that has engulfed the world. While the PM must light a candle for the victims of terror attacks in Paris, he could have done his own nation a huge service by lighting a diya of tolerance this Diwali, by giving not just its eminent citizens but also the common man the right and the assurance to ask for a plural society based on the fundamentals of equality and secularism.
Let us not silence and demonise the Khans. Mr. Prime Minister, remember what you said, sir, at the press conference in London with your British counterpart David Cameron. India, you said, was the land of Buddha and Gandhi and would never accept anything that went against its basic values. It is time, sir, that we fight for those very basic values that bind and project us a nation to reckon with across the world.

                            As expected venom spewing against the government and painting a fictional picture. Let's call a spade a spade, the biggest problem in the world is radical Islam and not your imaginary fears. You may have a pathological hatred for the PM, let's talk facts as per reports the crimes against Minorities and Dalits have reduced since 2013, please let us not bring our personal biases

                            Example of tolerance and intolerance:<br/><br/>
Tolerance is a non-Hindu mocks and rewarded with 300 Cr from box office for PK.<br/><br/>
Intolerance is Banning Lajja by Taslima Nasrin or banning Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie.<br/><br/>
People who are supporting Amir Khan are equally responsible for creating disharmony just like the one who are calling his name.

                            What are you trying to say here? Are you dictating what the PM has  to do? Writers like you are becoming a menace to this nation. You must remember that whatever you write there is going to be a sect of people who are going to support you and some against you. Dont create an impression in your writing that this country is going down.Dont be an Alarmist. Please do your investigation on the lives of khan's and if they are clean and behaving like Buddha and mahatma. If you writers can just shut up your mind that will be a great service to the nation. When you are mentally agitated and you go to a doctor he doesno analyse your mental problems  instead he gives a sleeping pill. He knows your agitated mind is because of temporary incidents which go off  on its own Once you come out of that thinking for some time. I agree writing is your bread butter but don't misuse it. Your writing  should instil peace in people not hatred. I request ndtv to stop writing new articles on this issue with different authors and go forward. Write an article which puts a full stop if you can.

                            Does she have any idea of what she keeps writing!!!!?? I am surely not a supporter of Modi or BJP , but is she blind to the way the Muslims arrogance has grown in the last decade!!! they are the most violent race and it is evident in every nook and corner of the world..... and with such huge population residing in india it is more than what we see elsewhere...we have no issues with the next door neighbor until they start bad mouthing Lakshmi Devi... and other gods while in the name of Allah the things they are doing all over....???? Are you blind.<br/>
In which way can anybody say that india is becoming intolerant...come to middle east.....you can see what intolerance actually means!!!<br/>
In fact i just read that in ISIS indians are treated as inferiors and are not worthy of a Zihadi bride it seems.....Try bad mouthing a muslim or an arab in Middle east......hope you return to this intolerant country safely after that!!!<br/><br/>
Muslims did not belong to this land. They came here...in fat invaded...later ...They were born here..and with times we started to live together. They should appreciate the gesture just like NRI's are welcomed in USA or in other countries and helped them build their country...but you try hitting lines on them.....will they tolerate.....Dont think so...<br/>
But we worship people irrespective of their religion....how will you explain Abdul Kalaam's presidency, Azharuddin's Captaincy, Sonia Gandhi's reign in India, Bollywood's tops stars supremacy, and many other examples.<br/>
Once again i reiterate, We Indian's have no issue with our next door neighbours.....but if they eat at our homes and start spitting on our plates or think they own our homes..we definitely have problems.....

                            I have rarely come across Rana Ayub making rational or reasoned argument. She is singularly minded about bashing the BJP, RSS and Modi. She abhors the BJP and the government led by Modi. If she were a fair minded individual, she would applaud many of the good things that the BJP and the government have done. She would applaud, for example, Narendra Modi's speech in the British parliament as Omar Abdullah had done.  No! She will only criticise and perenially play the victim. <br/><br/>
It is this victimhood that makes her into a biased story teller. Her poisonous mind and prejudiced views have no room for rational debate.

                            Dear Ms Ayub,<br/><br/>
The proof of the pudding is in the rice . If the attacks by al queda and the ISIS are night mares ..added with the daily deaths of our Jawans in the border , then the contributions of your favourite people like the madani, owaisi, SIMI , and millions of sleepers who have infected this country .. what is wrong in the debate of "us versus them" ...it is  natural and bound to happen. <br/><br/>
When you seem to feel for the so called minorities being killed .. have you ever seen a buddist , or a jain or a parsi or a sikh being killed ? in fact these people are the actual minority if you look at the national census. But these brothers/sisters conduct themselves with dignity , earn their respect and hence they are welcome to the mean stream by default ...unlike the people whome you feel for... whose motto is to pull India back wards and make it an extension of Pakistan.<br/><br/>
I am surprised by your intelligence when you say the PM is responsible for the killing of the so called rationalist in Karnataka . Do you understand that law and order is the state subject and the center is not accountable . In fact the report on Kalburgis murder is still to reach the center !!. Also you must understand that when a person has got a right to dissent , there is a right to oppose the dissent as well . Just because some body calls themselves rationalist - it does not give them the license to run their mouth and abuse others . Mr Kalburgis reference on many Hindu beleifs were really of the third grade and were insulting. Tell me... if there is an obscene remark on your sister or your mother .. wont you go all out for a war ?? Please understand the real meaning of intolerance ...It is all the more amusing to read your lines that say the there are no takers for ISIS in India . According to the reports from intelligence there are more than 100 known men belonging to your community who have joined ISIS waiting to destroy my country . There are unknown people - including women and children who are already being recruited ... and every day our soldiers and our police put their lives on the line to protect people including your people as well ... please get some sanity Ms Ayub...<br/><br/>
What is so dreading on the context of the BJP ministers asking muslims to go to pakistan ? was it not dreading when our people where chased away from Kashmir ? do you know the number of people who are still living as refugees in other states .. driven away from their own homes ? is not dreading to see that in the name of reservation and unwanted pampering given to these people has resulted in an un equal talent pool in the country ? Some times the medicine will be bitter .. it needs to be  swallowed for having a safe and a prosperous India ..<br/><br/>
Your new found love for sharuk and amir is just an opportunity to vent out your frustration against the BJP government . Just because some body is famous it does not mean that they can talk any thing they want .. I cannot imagine using the word Icon for a person who went to the stadium in an intoxicated state and got banned ...not to say the numerous summons to the king Khan from the IT department on his fudged up income ??? are these people Icons?<br/><br/>
Yes... I did think that Mr Amir was an intelligent person - till yesterday .. as rightly said by the government , he became "amir" only because we saw his movies and made him superstar .. And after all the incountable atrocities done by his ancestors to us , we STILL allow his people to live with us . <br/><br/>
Please tell me Ms Ayub, if the khans had run their mouth like they did in any other country like in Saudi or in China or in North korea - their heads would have been chopped . After hearing all the abuses from these so called stars .. the irony is that we would still go and see their movies .. make them more rich !!<br/><br/>
Is this not tolerance ? what else do you need ? In the name of plurality our country is now losing our Identity . The thumping victory given to the BJP and the percentage of voting was the result of the frustration of the Hindu's who have been the silent majority under your favourite rulers for 6 decades ...it it the time for our voices to be heard.. to get India forward...<br/><br/>
The Hindus have lived in peace with every body - right from the buddist to the parsis..and there has never been a single incident of the so called hatred between  these faiths . Why is that one faith is being always questioned ? This is some thing these so called intellectuals must ponder . If you want to be one amongst us , please leave us in peace . Let them go in their way .. and we will take our way . If you want to be treated like every body else you have to earn it .. not get it via reservations or government sops...<br/><br/>
what else we can expect from some "ayub"?

                            Everybody is on a emotional rollercoaster. Aamir publicly shared a personal moment which exposes his opinion on current situation in the country. There are going to some who do not agree with his point of view and will make it a point to express it. Social media is like tsunami and all damage is done in the first few hours. That is how it works. There are some who are going to love Aamir even more after this incident and vice versa. Lot of us believe the liberal media is going over the top on this intolerance topic.

I was watching the buck stops here the other day and i have a question for you. Can you explain the involvement of the govt. in snapdeal amir khan issue? Just because some BJP leader made bad comments doesn't mean the party stands by him. After all its a democratic party and people are bound to talk. That doesn't reflect the view of the entire party since he is not a spokesperson. <br/><br/>
I clearly know you understand all this. But you are creating this mess with a hidden agenda in mind. Come together for India and it's development.

                            Great Article Rana Ayyub. Your exaggeration on few stray incidents, supported by congress and media is fueling it more manipulated intolerance since the day one BJP came to power. You seem to very tolerant about Hindu ethnic cleansing from Kashmir and Killing of Sikhs in 84. Those were not stray incidents but systematically planned. Why have none of the media raised this point till now including you, where were these so called intellectuals hiding before and not single one ever returned any national award. Polarizing on sensitive issues is trend in Indian politics by every single party. Whenever I read your articles you sound pro-Muslims and against Hindus. I am a Hindu and was abused by a Christian for my faith few times in my life. First was in Goa when I was just a school kid, next few times in Delhi by little newly converted brain washed Christians by the missionaries. I have been abused by a Kashmir Muslim for my faith. But as parents always taught us believe in good karma and god has ways to punish those who hurt others. We live our life with low tolerance or may be with an oppressive feeling deep inside as why I don't have a voice to report these incidents to anyone. <br/>
I have voted for congress before but got fed up their dynastic rule and corruption. Yes, BJP was on the only good option this time to bring the change as there is no other party of national level. Also, I saw a Dynamic leader in Modi, who can develop India as a nation. He is working very hard for that. I don't vote for religion politics. You and congress have been staunch critics of Mr. Modi and doesn't matter how hard he is trying to uplift the country, you will oppose him. I don't a have free stage to speak but Amir being lucky to have one, should speak more intelligently in public.<br/>
Congress and opposition will do anything possible to create hurdle so that current government is not successful. Most of youth, irrespective of background should also think of leaving the country with 9th class fail becoming a dy. CM. Two days ago Rahul was seen with the guy whose wish was to cut Modi Ji into pieces.<br/>
You will see all the lowest level of most dirty tricks congress and opposition will play to defame BJP.<br/>
Unnecessary hype of intolerance is being created.<br/>
 If Amir is a statesmen, that quality should show in his words spoken in front on the whole nation.

                            Intolerance is increasing not against a particular religion but against the BJP government mainly because it has defeated all of the rabid anti-Hindu opposition..as usual it is the paid media, muslims and non-BJP politicians who are feeling insecure about their future in India because the BJP and its leaders have established themselves within India and the world that they mean business and growth as opposed to the others who preach secularism but practice rabid dirty politics....no citizen of India who believes that he belongs to India feels threatened as he is too busy to earn his daily livelihood and rests peacefully at night...it is the so-called rationalists who are threatened about their existence...predominantly they are muslims or people who support a particular religion for their selfish interests...please check the profile of the people who oppose the BJP and its policies - you will find a common strain of bacteria in them which is "staying idle with no work but only to find reasons to complain" - example you blog writers, Congress - best example Rahul Gandhi, MS Aiyar, Yadavs designated as Mullahs (Nitish, Lalu, the lady in Bengal) etc, why not ask a Hindu whether he feels threatened by muslims and their terrorism!!!

                            When will Muslims stop hiding behind the repeated "Islam is a religion of peace and love" when exactly the opposite is the perception of just about everyone else? Taking responsibility is not easy. It means talking and acting against stoning to death, severing limbs, decapacitation, killing of infidels, ill treatment of women and a host of other acts with supposed religious sanction. Till that happens, it will be a backward slide into irrelevance as religion fails to address social problems. That is fertile grounds for fundamentalists to rule through the fear of god. The oppressive regimes of the Middle East are testimony to that.

                            India is a diverse countries with multiple religions and faiths. While Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Muslims. Why is it that only Muslims feel threatened. I share rooms with a Sikh and here are his views . Being minority religion has its own sets of pro's such as stronger bond within the community and an opportunity to share a diverse view, and cons- lack of places of worship, fewer people with shared heritage etc.. If everyone focusses only on the cons and ignore the pro's then every minority everywhere in the world will be complaining. In reality india is one of the most tolerant and inclusive societies. Intolerance if any lies in the kind of a small elitist group of journalists and religious preachers. By lending his voice to the furore Amir has only worsened things as this will lead to even further polarisation, which benefits only the fringe elements.

We need to accept that there are issues and fix it, instead of hunting the messenger. Speaking of intolerance, how about asking Imran Tahir, the SA bowler on what he thinks of intolerance in India after the threats he received from Shiv Sena because he is Pakistan-born. You invite a player to your country, threaten and insult him. Tolerant India. Jai Ho????

                            If India is intolerant, he should have fled the country like people from Syria, Afghan, Pak..are fleeing. He could feel the real intolerance if people start boycotting his films.

                            Here comes the cheer leader.....BTW its shameful that some quarrel between individuals is compared to ISIS. Such ppl always try to act as if sky is falling when victim is frm minority and ignore and play down when victims are frm Majority.

                            where is the paranoia that you are talking about Ms. Ayyub? India is too pluralistic to fall to this trap of "generated paranoia". I guess you writing such scathing article against the government shows that there is no paranoia and there is no Indira type emergency. I am not a BJP supporter and not a "bhakt" specially, but your kinds are forcing the general educated public to come in support of this government.

                            If one looks at it objectively, Aamir has done more damage to the ordinary Muslims. He has only aggravated the intolerance of Muslims by others, which is a globally widespread fact today.

                            You have to be kidding me! The terror in India is greater than ISIS?!!  A few pointers: First, how have only the Khans contributed  to the idea of India? As far as I can see they have made some amazing movies, garnered lots of fans and made pots of money. Second, if Chetan Bhagat makes a comment that is not to your liking, you label him bigoted and ignorant. I think it is you who is being intolerant here. Third, all trolls on one side of the camp are pro-Modi, BJP, etc. How do you know that? I am criticising you so I am a troll but I am not a Modi fan either. So what does that make me?

                            Amir Khan rightly said, that we look upon the elected representatives centre and state to not just give us assurance that action will be taken against perpetrators of intolerance, but personally see to it that action against them is set as an example. Why are the BJP leaders who are making racial remarks, not being reprimanded? Why is the PM not interfering?

                            I don't see intolerance in day-to-day life. Its media's timepass truly. Socially, all Muslims prefers staying closely in one area. Unless you need to go in that area, you don't see reason to interact. Has author visited Bhendi Bazaar areas in Mumbai? If she feels secure there, then we are staying in tolerant nation.

                            What is religion is to do with all this. Aamir has his view which are influenced by his wife : who cares. Did he asked our support - NO. Did he asked us to join together to make a difference - NO..... Why everyone is reacting so much. Don't we have better things to do...... Yes we do... Let Aamir decided what is best for him and his family.. he is the better judge and matured enough to take right call... All the best is the maximum we have tell as we know him on the screen and may be a send off if he leaves. Let us remember the good part and wish he too will.

Country wasn't intolerant during all the earlier turmoils , communal unrests when Congress was in power. Please speak as a responsible citizen.

                            Ayyub, your loathing for Modi and all things Hindu is going to consume you. You are knowingly or otherwise fanning communal passions and as such you have injected yourself as being a part of the problem rather than the solution. Someone who has the intelligence to write diatribe upon diatribe about Modi, Hindutva and BJP should know that you are yourself not exactly a widely popular figure that people feel like sending warm wishes to you on Eid. On the contrary a very large majority of people see your hateful, manufactured vendetta filled distasteful messages and abhor you equally and incrementally more every single day as I am sure your mail box would reveal to you when you log on every morning. This is however just a reflection of what you espouse and if you are really looking for a climate that fosters peace and harmony between various communities then you and your fellow travelers need to tone it down and be moderate in your approach. And this is a mere suggestion and not a warning. However if your hubris and arrogance is any indication, then you will do anything but and it will eventually result in a calamitous upheaval - one that is not favorable to anyone.  The only countries that would benefit from that are Pakistan and China, and your patriotism that you so flaunt wouldn't want that to happen would it? I hope you happen to read this and open your eyes. All the best in hopefully turning around and making positive change. If you change then 1000's shall change on the so called "other side".

                            I see a very dangerous trend emerging. And it is even more dangerous than the Hindu vs Muslim debate, in reality it is Modi supporters vs Modi haters. Irrespective of whatever the topic, Modi haters will oppose it and Modi supporters will back it. Intolerance debate is currently being dragged just to inflame this constant tussle between the two groups and it is certainly dangerous.<br/>
I think the need of the hour is to stick together and work towards development which India badly needs. Whether we like or dislike Modi, the truth is that he has been selected to lead the country and he has to be given the chance to do so. Pulling him down at this hour will not serve the purpose since we simply do not have alternatives right now and world is watching India's image. We all love India and I hope we can stick together to do so.

                            Dear Mr. Amir Khan,<br/><br/>
I used to be a fan of yours. I feel really sad when I use the words 'used to be', simply because I dont think I will see your movies henceforth, even on television. Your movies gave me tremendous happiness, pride and sometimes I felt like you are telling the story that I wanted to tell. When I saw 'Sarfarosh' for the first time, I remember I was zapped by it. I felt you are talking my language. 'Lagaan' is very close to heart, coz it is one of the brilliant movies made in India. 'Dil Chahata Hai' still brings out the memories of my college days. I laughed with you in 'Andaz Apna Apna' and cried in 'Taare Zameen Par'. You were one of the most favorite actors, even though you gave some really bad movies.<br/><br/>
But today I really feel ashamed of you. And I mean it. I actually have started feeling ashamed of all you so called celebrities in Bollywood. Mind you, we are the ones who gave you name n fame. We loved you from the bottom of our hearts. We laughed with you, cried with you, stood behind you. And with the same right, I feel saying I am not going to see any movies of yours. Till now, I never felt telling this to any other so called celebrity, but with you things are different. I am telling this, coz I felt I am being cheated by my favorite actor, by making a comment on my NATION.<br/><br/>
Is India really an intolerant nation? This country, it gave you name, fame, money...everything a successful person needs. It treated you as its son. Think of a country, where releasing a movie itself is a crime. And you stood tall in this nation. Mind you Mr. Amir, this nation is OUR. And when I say OUR its just not Hindus. I am including Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Buddhists and every religion, every cast. We create this country. And honestly, WE do not need anyone who thinks this is an intolerant nation and wants to leave this country. You are most welcome to move out and live in any country you want to. <br/><br/>
Just few days back, someone in Maharashtra, hardly 300 kms. away from your place in Mumbai lost his life while fighting a battle in Kashmir. We all mourned, we all saluted the brave soldier. And just after 2 days of his death, his widow has asked the Government to offer her the same role of her husband. She wants to go and fight in place of her husband. This is called patriotism. We salute Col. Santosh Mahadik and his wife Swati. They are true heroes. <br/><br/>
Finally, I think this is time to say Good Bye. You may be a brilliant actor, but MY NATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU. Thank you very much. I am happy not to see your movies. I will better spend my time in doing something constructive for my country.

                            rana here's a tip. people will be more open to what you have to say when they realize you dont have a huge chip on your shoulder or axe to grind with the person you are criticizing. aamir khan (and farhan akhtar) signed the petition against mr.modi becoming PM, shahrukh khan was also reported as having made anti-modi statements last year. you have also taken snide digs at bjp and mr.modi in your 'articles'. yes, everyone can have an opinion on anyone, but then dont be surprised later when people dont believe you folks to be neutral or agenda-less or to take you seriously when you say something. and then you intellectuals will brand them intolerant and abusive but you dont seem to realize its the other side of the same coin

                            No matter how many self-proclaimed-intellectual's blogs are promoted by NDTV in supporting Aamir's statement, it is the ground reality that his comments unsettled the majority of Indians. Or you may want to conduct a poll to see the reality?? With no communal riots, no corruption in this government, the media and congress are creating a bubble around "intolerance" to influence the people. Sadly majority of the citizens who do not watch these media are still not able to see the bubble created by them!!

                            Ms Rana Ayyub I agree with some of the things you write and I do not fully agree with some of the things you have written. It is has nothing to do with their name. In that case Lalburki should not have been killed as his name is very Hindu but he got killed. These incidences have been happening not just in Independent India but even in ancient era. There are always people whether left or right or any religion they do not see beyond their singular view that is when trouble starts.    <br/><br/>
A bunch of Leftist who spew venom at the sight of the rightist are behind this intolerance debate. They are intolerant to any view other than their self proclaimed high moral ground so called liberal views. All these things that the Intolerance propaganda brigade are saying was happening even more during the past but these people never said anything. <br/><br/>
This brigade compare their returning to Guru Rabindranath Tagore returning title Given by the British Empires Ruler from whom we were struggling for independence. They received their awards from free institutions and the Government of India elected by them and fellow citizen. So when they return the award they are hurting the very Democratic fibre which they claim to protect. The right might rule for sometime and the left will rule for sometime that is democracy. USA is going through a turmoil of Black being targeted and killed and Islamophobia views are is being openly being expressed there however they carry out protest and dialogue in a decent manner. These left so called liberals do not like to hear voice other than what they like it looks like that   <br/><br/>
It amuses me. I am neither left nor right I am a simple human who believes in peace and love. That is the religion we need to follow. Some of great I admire are Thiruvallvar, Ottakuthur, G B Shaw and Bertrand Russell. Their philosophy was a borderless world of free thinking.<br/><br/>
Amir Khan I though was a sensible man who measures his word before using it. I think he has erred in framing what he wanted to say. He has unnecessarily angered the right liberals too.

                            What happen to intellect of this country is questionable, when page 3 (three) projected on page 1(one) brings headlines with their ill thoughts. <br/>
First thing first is Amir Khan or ShahRukh Khan are not the "Hallmark of Secularism or National Integration or Unity". Its myth people are spreading because they are not specialized in this subject. If so , then why ISRO Chairman OR Scientist from Bhabha Automic Research Center OR Shankarachaary of Kashi was asked this questions? <br/>
You cannot ask question irrelevant question to person or who has no clue on subject.<br/><br/>
Asking wrong question to wrong people cannot justify wrong doing of any news channel. This is manufactured agenda of particular news channel to spread communal Hatred to destabilize the country's communal harmony and integrity.
