Headline::::Dear Minister Jaitley: Open Letter from Mani Shankar Aiyar



DateTime::::2015-10-20T18:30:00+05:30




                                Dear Minister Jaitley,
 
Although you took even longer than your boss to do so, I am relieved you have at long last discovered that the lynching of poor Mohammad Akhlaq at Dadri was "extremely unfortunate and condemnable". Of course, much stronger language was called for and, given that you are Number 2 or 3 in your government, it would have been better when you saw your Prime Minister keeping his mouth firmly shut that, as a "right-thinking person", you should have jumped up much, much earlier to damn your many colleagues who were seeking to "rationalize and condone such action".
But I am distressed that your principal reason for speaking up late than never is that "such incidents bring a bad name to the country". This is essentially an ethical and moral issue, not a matter of realpolitik. Don't you see that all these sinful things are "bad" in themselves and not to be condemned only in a belated effort to salvage the nation from getting a "bad name"?
Until such moral imperatives take precedence over utilitarian considerations in your way of running the government, there will be cause for deep concern amongst all "right-thinking" persons. And might I remind you that all the writers who have returned their awards and are now the object of your scorn are "right-thinking" people?
 
Of course, some of them do happen to be "with left or Nehruvian leanings". That does not stop them from being right-thinking. Indeed, it is precisely because they are "right-thinking" that they are leftist and Nehruvian. Otherwise, like you, they would be Rightist and Savarkarian. On one point though, you are perfectly correct: "the thrust of the writers' protest appears to be that under the present Central Government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, an atmosphere of intolerance has been created in the country."
 
Can't you see the atmosphere of intolerance? Do you not feel it in your bones? When a man is killed and his son left for dead for not following the dictates of the self-righteous clan you belong to, do you not see that as intolerance? When you hear the reactions of your ministerial colleagues, your parliamentary comrades, your party bullies, does not the stench of intolerance fill your nostrils? When faces are blackened for holding a different view, is that par for the course? When stadia are vandalized by your partners in state governments, does that not disgust you? It does us.
That is what makes for the rift valley between your Sangh Parivar Hindutivists and the vast majority of democracy-loving, open-minded, decent citizens of this country. It is what drives the conscience of over 40 of our most distinguished public intellectuals, the glitterati among our literati, to cast away the one recognition they have received of their worth to society. They do not take to mob attacks and lynching to make their protest; in a perfectly democratic, tolerant but decisive way, they are trying to ask you to end the sin of Dhritarashtra in which you and your lot are caught, the sin of moral blindness.
 
 It is absurd to suggest, as you have, that these 40 and more labourers of the intellect and the imagination are motivated by their "political prejudices". They are not. Acting quite independent of each other, from qasbahs and small towns to giant metropolises, from all corners of the country, east, west, north, south, these prisoners of conscience have broken their chains and stood up for a cause greater than any politics: the great human cause of the right to life. Theirs is no "paper rebellion" or "manufactured crisis". It is your response that is manufactured, a paper tissue of irrelevancies and outright lies. You belong to a hide-bound tradition that allows of no dissent, dictatorial in conception, narrow in outlook, authoritarian in manner, and thuggish in action. That is what prevents you from seeing wrong in your own ranks. I concede you are quick to discover what is inconvenient - such as that dangerous innocent, your Minister of Culture, naively, if wickedly, mouthing the truth about all of you while not seeing the political pitfalls of doing so. But, at heart, there is no difference between Mahesh Sharma and you. For who can forget that, despite your decades-long membership of the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat - and perhaps in sheer servitude to the man who bestowed that favour on you - you have never uttered a word of condemnation of what happened post-Godhra in Gujarat under the stewardship of your mentor, Narendra Modi. When silence was not an option, you chose to remain silent and have kept silent for over a decade. The passage of years does not take away from the pogrom you have never found fit to deplore and make amends for.
 
Instead you keep flogging the political dead horse of the Emergency. Of course the Emergency was wrong. It should never have happened. But it was the very people who threw out Indira Gandhi for the Emergency who brought her back. They could see the country needed her; they could see that the pack of jokers who had replaced her had ignominiously collapsed, woefully betraying those who put them into office. But that apart, how dare you invoke the Emergency when railing against that "leftist and Nehruvian" Nayantara Sahgal, whose was the first pebble that started the avalanche? Was it her "political prejudices" or her conscience that led her to denounce her cousin-by-blood, Indira Gandhi, all through the Emergency and beyond. She protested then. She protests now - for her outrage is based on fundamental values and fundamental rights. She protested the suspension of fundamental rights during the Emergency. She protests the suspension of fundamental values under your dispensation. Hers is not "politics by other means" as you derisively describe it; hers is morality by every means. She spoke out and still speaks out against the horrors of Gujarat 2002.
 
You claim that to "manufacture a revolt, it is necessary to obfuscate the truth". This is no "manufactured revolt": it is the agonized cry of the conscience, a conscience that always acts individually and is, therefore, sincere. These writers have not selectively condemned what they see around them. They have collectively condemned what can only be described as the putative Nazification of our society.
 
You will not succeed. For India's civilization is stronger than your political obfuscation. It is precisely the triumphalism that has made you Finance Minister that breeds the arrogance and moral purblindness that stands nakedly revealed within 500 days of your dalliance with political power. You are transient. The Idea of India has not been extinguished. These writers are the torch-bearers of all that has kept the flame alight these thousands and thousands of years. It is your perversions of that heritage that will be re-consigned to the dustbin of history in 2019, as they were in 1979.  (Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Good One.... Being a Hindu, I am really sad at the current state of my country. You cannot ask Muslims to go back to Pakistan or follow hindu culture... You should be out of your minds to do it.<br/><br/>
This Country belongs to all of us. Do we have a replacement for Abdul Kalam.. a replacement for Mother Teresa??? <br/><br/>
BJP... please read the writing on the wall...I voted for you after being fed up of the corrupt Congress.. When Sonia Gandhi made the speech soon after the election asking BJP not to bring out its Communal agenda, I was laughing at her... But now I clearly get that she knew what was coming.....<br/><br/>
Please do not divide us for your political again... We are a country of tolerance...

                            Excellent article shredding Mr. Jaitley's manufactured defense of his government to pieces. Appalling to see that so far there is no sincere effort from the ruling party to control its cadre from taking law on their hands. The current political regime stands answerable today - starting with the Prime Minister himself, for breaking this unspoken Lakshman Rekha with his pink revolution remarks.

                            There have been shoals of Congressmen , who have criticized the state of emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi. Even Sonia Gandhi has admitted that it was a mistake. Is there a single BJP member, apart from the venerable Vajpayee -of course no paid heed to Vajpayee, who has spoken against Gujarat riots &gt;</div>

                            Haters will keep hating you blindly, but you said it right sir. General levels of intolerance is on the rise and it is very unhealthy for the country. Blind followers of BJP will keep supporting it, but anyone who voted for development, will know that a divided country can never develop. Mr Jaitley made that statement in New York, because of course over there he needed to sound right

                            At the outset let me state that i have criticized Mani for many of his views on this site. I was fed up with congress and corruption. I was fed up with a PM who was silent and accepted all the foolish deeds of his Party and Ministers. I wanted change. I wanted Vikas for all. That is what was promised. But do you see how it is all rather similar right now. Corruption is out -maybe- and in its place is a very virulent form of cancer, intolerance. This is not what i voted for. And i will look for change again. <br/>
Mr Aiyer, this is one of the best articles you have penned. Kudos and hope you continue in a similar vein.

                            Those are strong words and I am not sure how justified they are. After all we heard the same outrage in the wake of the attack on a few churches during the earlier part of the year. The BJP spokespersons do not tire of telling that these were events involving minor thefts and had nothing to do with an attack on minorities. So far we havent heard anyone rebut that claim.<br/><br/>
Is the media and the opposition crying wolf too often these days without enough supporting evidence? Eventually they will lose their credibility if that is the case. If it isnt and the BJP and its allies are indeed following a communal agenda then as Mr Aiyer says, there is nothing to worry as this dispensation will self destruct in the next general elections. The country's civilizational ethos is too strong to be drawn into any sort of communal conflict in this day and age. I am sure BJP is aware of this as they themselves acknowledge they have not made any electoral gains from such events in the past<br/><br/><br/>
Political obfuscation may be the tool of political opportunists but the citizens of this country are grounded in reality. The country is far too busy struggling to meet the challenges in an overpopulated and underresourced land to bother about political parties that have a communal agenda and obfuscations, if any (and on whichever side), wont take them far

                            As always Mani Shankar Aiyar has brilliantly analysed and explained the dangerous political and social environment being created in India by the prime minister Modi led BJP and it's various affiliates ultra rightwing organisations operating under fake loyalty to Hinduism.--- So hardly surprising that yet again the well organised army of trolls, the brainless fascistic wonders who blindly support Modi just like the Nazis were fascinated with world's biggest monster Hitler, have got rattled like snakes in American desert and posted their usual abuse and anti Aiyar comments.--- Thankfully in the real world away from forums dominated by highly biased and politically motivated organised trolls, the silent majority is full of sane people who neither want India turned into Hindu version of religion based Islamic countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan or Saudi Arabia etc or transform socialist Bhagat Singh revolutionary patriot Netaji Bose and saintly secularist Mahatma Gandhi's India into Germany when ruled by Hitler.--- That silent majority has and will respect Mani Aiyar and highly respected and famous intelligent personalities who have returned their awards as principled protest against intolerance encouraged, either directly or indirectly, by Modi led government's confusing and inconsistent policies.--<br/>

                            As always, a passionate and fair appeal to Jaitley, who is such an opportunist that he was the first to support Modi and dump Advani. Jaitley lost the election but was appointed Finance Minister. A lawyer by training is now lecturing DR Rajan on how to run the RBI. Jaitley will sing Modi's tunes and the Nation will turf these guys out soon. However, the end may come sooner because a disaster in Bihar will get Shatrughan Sinha and Advani take on the Modi brigade. Jaitley and Modi are in the branding business and hence he says' these events give India a bad name'. Shame on you Jaitley

                            Mani has become the social media agent of Congress and his only job is to write negativity about the ruling party. Don't keep any hopes you guys are not coming back. With 40 odd writers whom Congress had given awards for their loyalty and affiliation returning it now, there is going to be no impact.

                            For the killing of one Muslim he wrote an essay.It would be interesting to see how many letters he wrote over the killing raping and looting of Kashmir pundits.Perhaps for him killing of Hindus does not matter as it does not effect the bogus secular image created for India by Congress.But Majority does not like these sophisticated bogus secularists have dumped them in the dustbin in 2014.

                            The idea of India as imagined by Gandhi, Nehru, Azad and Sardar is not yet dead. And as long as there are people like Nayantara and the multitude of writers and thinkers like her and yourself, the idea will never cease to be. India is not secular because their are Muslims like me and other adherents of different faiths that co-exist but largely because most Hindus are secular and liberal. The Sanghis need a false sense of bravado and therefore resorting to cowardly acts of terror. The larger communities sees through this and they will resent it. it is worth mentioning that the vast majority of muslims and christians against whom much of this hatred is directed have acted with great responsibility and restraint. They must continue to do so for we cannot fail the idea of India. Mani, more power to your pen!

                            How come such an obnoxious writer like Mani the maniac have been spared?-:))<br/><br/>
Now, Coming to the point, Rabindranath Tagore repudiated the Knighthood to protest the Jalliwanwala Bagh massacre. That was a real cause. He was protesting  against the barbaric act of the British  government. But in these cases I cannot find any legitimate reason.  Here the acts have been perpetrated by certain fringe elements. Respective state governments have been either prosecuting the culprits or trying  to nab them. The President and Prime Minister of the country have unequivocally condemned the incidents. Modi government has advised the states to take strong  actions in case of Dadri like incidents. One should not forget that law and order is a state subject, and in Karnataka or in UP there is no BJP government. <br/><br/>
So, it appears to me that these protests are politically  motivated.

                            The trouble with Mani is he has tunnel vision. In that vision there all good if it the Congress and all bad if it is the BJP. If he just looks around to his left and right he would improve his vision assuming he is capable of seeing.  I like glancing through his articles just to find what new stupid and onetrack comments and ideas he can come up with and he grinds the same stone in different way to arrive at the same hypothesis.<br/>
I must confess I enjoy the comments of the readers more.

                            I don't know what is worse, the actions of BJP recently or that now I have to applaud Mani Shankar Aiyer for his view points. Sadly, every word is true, I am an Indian, a Hindu, I also eat beef and I reject the notion that it is OK to kill a man (Hindu of Muslim) for alleged cow slaughter. Human life has to have greater sanctity over an animals's, gau mata or not. I would gladly accept have a corrupt government that at least tries to uphold my fundamental rights, rather than one that perpetrates and condones murder under the false promises the "acche din".

You are a boring person. You are more boring then "Sonia Gandhi" and his "weird" son "Rahul"./ " I have a doubt Rahul is Gay"  " but don't worry, he can get married in USA". He can get married with the "Prince of Rajpipla", People will then elect "Rahul Gandhi" as the Prime minister. Then, Mani you will come again in power.<br/><br/>
Reading your posts shows that you have "lost your marbles".<br/><br/>
Stop writing posts, your posts are depressing and biased. <br/><br/>
Modi's next campaign to be "development of your mind, Mani"<br/><br/>
Congress has gone, it will never come again in power with "Rahul", whose IQ shows off when he speaks.

                            Ever since the BJP Govt came to power in May/ June 2014,  the fabric of our country started to be attacked and pierced and torn by the satraphs of the BJP/ RSS combined. How I wish that our country reverts to the pre 1991 days when all of us were so happy and never even thought of something that we now call as COMMUNAL. Mani Shankar is absolutely right in everything he has stated in his article..... Arun Jaitely is an opportunist and waiting in the wings to become the PM. Pl remember Arun Jaitely, Mr. Advani who was the first one to taer the lovely fabric of INDIA , only to achieve his dream of becoming the PM could NEVER achieve it. History will never tolerate such people and you will be no different. Mr. Jaitely, just by speaking in English (you are not that great also) you cannot bring in peace. Neither will India's economy become strong. You need to have intelligence and a strong foundation of tolerance , stop being greedy and arrogant, which Mr. Jaitely is now your hallmark.

Very hopeless sir as your entire education experience has been devoted to be a servant of Sonia and her family instead of devoting your life to nation and people like Dr Abdul Kalam. Cannot understand why on earth NDTV or media encourage you who are so scared to take the leadership of congress . Dear sir , Lalooji is more confident than you sir. You are only hiding behind Soniaji. Very unfortunate sir

                            Write a love letter to your madam ji... writing letter to Modi doesn't help. Forget Modi, I also didnt read a single line... straight jumped to comments.

                            Dear Mani, Emergency, Turkman Gate, Anti-Sikh pogrom, Bhagalpur riots, Kashmiri Pandit Exodus, Hounding of Taslima Nasreen, Hounding of Salman Rushdie, etc. happened during Congress rule &amp; with passive or active support from the Government. Were these supposed to be signs of tolerance, peace &amp; harmony? Also if those people who threw Indira out brought her back, then the same people brought Narendra Modi. So accept it. And no doubt Nayantara Sahagal denounced Emergency, but the reason for returning the award looks flimsy, since she accepted the award barely 2 years after the Sikh massacre and its justification by the then PM (Remember Big tree falls Ground shakes justification by 21st Century driven PM ?)

                            Sri.Mani - I think that by doing padaseva to Smt.Indira Gandhi &amp; her fly you got your IFS .You had enjoyed a lot under their rule.Hence you are now also craving to be ruled by them in spite of the greatest of the scams done by your party members.

                            Dear Manishankar Iyer<br/>
Come out of Mind set you have first before preaching others. I appreciate your loyalty to<br/>
whom you serve as party member. But forgotten basics. Whatever you have said is equally applicable to <br/>
you and your party. Has your, so called individual conscious, told you this.<br/>
Instead of writing such things, if you are really Indian, write something which really brings change in<br/>
society, irrespective of which party you are in. Any such incidents are not debated in public forum and that to with such negative energy. But one thing is clear no matter which party India stands as one.<br/>
Media is not any good by prolonging this debate in a negative outlook. Reach out to public but to bring positive agenda to nullify the impact of such incidents.

                            Dear Mr Iyerji.....Your Congress party has delivered in almost 60 years of its unbroken rule, most of it with massive majority: 1. Mass poverty (UN stats), 2. most mal-nourished in the workd (UN stas), 3. over 50% illiteracy (that equals 625 million), 4. A country not a Nation because after 70 years of independence we are still haunted by division of all kinds....because your party created segments (a marketing technique) through caste, religion, language, region and so forth. Kashmir...Your party gave it away freely and we still today pay a heavy price for that also. You have given us rampant corruption starting at the very top to the grassroots of every part of government. You can say what you want to say as we are living in a democracy (which was hard fought for during Your emergency), but it will lack credibility. Your own party lacks democracy!

                            Mr Mani, your compulsive hatred exhibited in your write-ups perhaps always results in helping NDA, mainly PM Modi.  You have to surf the comments and tabulate the likes and dislikes. It is proof enough. A "chai" comment gave enormous benefit to your perceived opponents. I say 'perceived' because I have a strange feeling that you are writing all these at the behest of NDA parivar. Anyways, keep it up. We need humour these days.
