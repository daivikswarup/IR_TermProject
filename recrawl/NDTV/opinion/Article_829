Headline::::Modi Quotes Gandhi Wrongly, Yet Again



DateTime::::2015-09-14T13:48:00+05:30




                                The Tenth World Hindi Conference in Bhopal last week was regaled by the Prime Minister informing his audience drawn from 39 countries that he had learned Hindi by buying milk from UP doodhwallahs when he was helping out in his family canteen at the State Transport Depot, Ahmedabad. (Of course, as usual, he embroidered his story by describing himself as "selling tea", which is simply not true - for he never was a chaiwallah). But it would appear that while he may have picked up his Hindi in the course of his commercial transactions, he did not pick up either Lucknow's famed good manners or common propriety from them, for he launched before this international gathering into a blistering political attack on Sonia Gandhi, using expressions that should never have been uttered at an international forum.
In the brouhaha, the main point of the meeting was lost - which is surely how we are to develop the Hindi language in the light of the "Special Directive" contained in Article 351 of our Constitution. Article 351 is not one of the  "Directive Principle of State Policy", which are not justiciable, but incorporated in Chapter IV of Part XVII of the Constitution headed "Special Directives". It is justiciable and in respect of which there are important Supreme Court judgements.
Article 351 constitutes the distilled essence of the long and complex argument over the period of the Freedom Movement as to what should be the "national" language of independent India - an argument that wound around the controversy over whether it should be Sanskritised Hindi or the commonly spoken Hindustani which drew from Urdu, Persian and Arabic, in addition to Sanskrit and khari boli.  
In the drafting committee, a form of words was evolved as the "Directive for the development of the Hindi language" (and, therefore, binding on all PMs from Nehru to Modi and their future successors) through what came to be known as the K.M. Munshi - N. Gopalaswamy Ayyangar formula. It was then passed by the Constituent Assembly and now figures as Article 351, reading as follows:
It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure is enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, styles and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, where necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages.
Instead of elaborating at Bhopal on what his government had done to carry out the multiple directions embodied in Article 351, Modi made the wholly bogus claim that Gandhi was among the non-Hindi speakers who advocated Hindi - which is simply not true. As Mohd. Hifzur Rahman pointed out in the debate that covered Article 351 in the Constituent Assembly on 12-14 September 1949 (coincidentally, exactly 66 years ago to the day on which this column is being written), Gandhiji came down firmly in favour of "Hindustani in both the Devanagiri and Urdu scripts", explicitly rejecting "a separate language that was Sanskritized". Rahman quoted Gandhiji as saying: "By Hindi, I mean the language which is spoken in Northern India and which is spoken and understood by the Hindus and Muslims throughout India". Rahman pointed out that when this was not agreed to, Gandhiji resigned from the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan to espouse the cause of "plain and simple Hindustani". Indeed, he went so far as to insist that Hindi could not be the "Rashtra Bhasa" as that exalted position should go to Hindustani. To this end, in the last few months of his life, Mahatma Gandhi started the Hindustani Pracharni Sabha. Even three days before his assassination, he told Hifzur Rahman that he wanted to propagate "the cause of Hindustani".
Qazi Syed Karimuddin was clearly correct when he said in the same debate: "If Mahatma Gandhi was alive today he would have seen that on this issue the Congress stood firm like a rock and Hindustani in both scripts was adopted." For Gandhiji recognized, as few others did, that Urdu should be treasured. In the words of Hifzur Rahman, "Urdu is the product of Hindu-Muslim unity, their conversations and way of life, the glimpses of which would be found in the market-place, in any house, and every lane or by-lane. It was the product of natural love and affection."
It is typical of Modi that he should seek to appropriate the great Mahatma to a movement of which Gandhiji disapproved. Even a casual glance through the writings and speeches of the Father of the Nation would have shown Modi that Gandhiji's view was "crores of Indians know Hindustani - they do not know any other language. And if you want to steal into their hearts, Hindustani is the only language open to you" (Young India, 2 February 1921). And yet, not even the word "Hindustani" appears in Modi's address to the World Conference! Instead, he commits the outrage of including Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose also in his list of "non-Hindi speaking" advocates of Hindi: indeed, even as the name of the Azad Hind Fauj demonstrates, Netaji was an advocate not of Hindi but Hindustani. It is this, and not the Modi interpretation, that is reflected in the Constitution. Modi continues what Frank Anthony in the same debate in the Constituent Assembly described as "those friends of ours who have been the most ardent, if not fanatical, protagonists of Hindi have done the cause of Hindi greater disservice than anyone else."
Let the last word lie with Jawaharlal Nehru who summed up Article 351 by recalling that Gandhji felt "language should be more or less a language of the people, not a language of a learned coterie" and that, most importantly, "language should reflect the compose culture of India." He urged that we should "proceed wisely" by making Hindi "an inclusive language and not an exclusive one, and include in it all the elements in India which have gone to build it, with a streak of Urdu or a mixture of Hindustani".(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            I just cant understand why Mani labours so much on this issue. Perhaps his only point seems to be that Modi has gotten Gandhi wrong on semantics. Point granted. NOw what?? Modi's speeches in Hindi across the country are doing more to propogate that language than what Sonia's Italianised accent of reading written Hindi speeches can ever do.<br/><br/>
Beyond that all of Manis's histrionics deserve to go the dustbin.

                            Mani I am good fan of you now. There is great amount of learning from you about to how to find negativity from a great deal of positivity. Also your articles are totally against the general perception of what public at large things about Modi. Your articles will help more people to support Modi and his ideas. Being a loyal Modi supporter, i wish you keep writing venom about Modi, and he will keep getting more loyal supporters. I know that you believe writing about Modi is only way for you to get in limelight. As Modi says, everyone even his critics support his livelihood by Japping Modi..modi..modi.modi.

                            It was Mani's Chaiwala insult that was used by Modi to the hilt in last election &amp; Congress lost miserably. So in a way Mani has a 1 penny contribution to BJP's victory. Mani is trying to correct it by opening the blog saying Modi was never a Chaiwala. But its too late dear. Now at least 10 years of writing blogs if not more!

This foolish chap Aiyer always quotes something that happened 75 years ago and that nobody else has heard about. Is Modi expected to know what Gandhi and Bose thought of Hindi while inaugurating this conference? BTW which Gandhi was he referring to - the Mahatma or the Alpatma?

                            As usual, half truths from Mani Shankar Aiyar is (at least partly). Its true that most of our founding fathers did favour 'hindustani' as opposed to 'Hindi'. However, if getting it right on Gandhi was the first priority, Aiyar's own party should have been disbanded at independence! As for the chaiwallah bit, I'd like to know how Aiyar is able to comment on that with such authority.

I being native of Uttar Pradesh take pride in telling people that the language of our liking Hindi/Urdu is language of two nation India and Pakistan. Gandhi ji  and Subhash Bose were also highly learned people who achieved impossible. Modi's deliberate attempt to malign these  great leaders suggests that he cannot be relied upon.

                            Language, Culture and Scientific progress have always been fully autonomous in their origin, sustenance and progress. No law, Constitution, Political leader, politics or diktat of any other`authority' has ever worked for or against them. Even if they made some difference, that was always very short lived; but none of them have the power to work on these for a long time. Law walks behind these forces and not ahead of them. It is necessary for the politicos and administrators of all hues and cries to know that there is a self perpetuating, potentially progressing force among the people that is supra-constitutional in nature. In fact, being `above the law' is the meaning of their existence. And therefore every time I wish to speak about Language or a language, I ought first to accept and respect its self-ruling nature. Problem arises when a certain elite (add oligarchs now to this class) impersonates as law and carries her wish as static, dictatorial force over the flowing water of these forces. Urdu in fact is Hindustani deriving its contents from Sanskrit, Hindi, Punjabi, Pushtu, Persian and Arabic. Till 1947 Urdu remained, more or less, what Gandhiji perceived or labelled as Hindustani. Today, the same Hindustani carries words even from South, West  and East Indian languages. Besides, Hindi (call it Hindustani if you wish) when spoken in a region away from Vishwanath Temple  accepts words that pour in it by the gravitational pull of the mother tongues of the speakers in the region. So "Gulata" is added with "Jhagraa" in Karnatak, "Ganda gol" makes another synonym of "Fasaad" in the Eastern states, "Maska" adds to the flavour of "Makhan" in Tenali (is it in Telangana or in A.P.?). And I am sure, Hindi of Myladutarai carries some words in Tamil too. But most of all, it is English, dammit,that we are politically supposed to hate in Lucknow, has become  chief FDI supplier to Hindi. I have learnt following new Hindi words in the face page of Dainik Bhaskar on the net today:- PM, Users, Journalist, Business, Monsoon effect, Hydro power, RTI... This shows something different. All arguments about the official language so far in India stand a begging against the new force of a supra culture that makes or changes rules by its own dynamics.

                            South Indian languages are influenced lot more by Sanskrit some heavily and some less. If you look at whole of India, Sanskritized Hindi is more appropriate. The same is mentioned in L K Advani's biography.

What was done to improve the status of Hindi, during long ruling of Congress?<br/><br/>
You can start with a self written blog in Hindi if you are capable.<br/><br/>
If one wants to prove someone wrong there are many points to discuss. Have you tried to see what Modi is capable of? Do you feel you have even 10% of his oratory skill and general knowledge about most of the India?<br/><br/>
Any ways keep us amazing and help to kill the time.. Thanks

                            Sangh parivar and later BJP have been at it (mis interpreting/ attacking Gandhi/ Nehru)  for 60 years  but they never succeeded. But now Modi and his army of supporters are very successful at it. Mani and the Congress party must really think why this is happening? Why is it that What they could not do for 60 years they are able to do so strongly now? The real reason is the weak leadership of Congress party which neither has the ability nor the stature of  a Nehru or Indira Gandhi. Mani and all the advisers/ideologues  of the Congress party must seriously address this issue. What is the use of all your knowledge and erudition if your leader is seen as a novice who needs a cheat sheet  to speak in parliament?

                            When many parts of India is not in favor of Hindi itself , Ayiar is talking about the option of Hindi or Urdu . The constituency from where he lost his deposit in TN, people never speak Hindi or Urdu and 100% opposition for that language. I am afraid Aiyar is  not aware of his constituency sentiments and expectations. There are many more problems to worry about and it seems Aiyar is just wasting his time and reader's as well.

                            Formula for Mani's blog.<br/><br/>
1.) Blast Modi.<br/>
2.) Take the name of Mahatma Gandhi.<br/>
3.) Take the name of Rajiv Gandhi.<br/>
4.) Take the name of Nehru.<br/>
5.) Take the name of Indira Gandhi.<br/>
6.) Say how good the congress governance was for past 60 years.<br/>
7.) use the word secularism.<br/>
8.) use the word communal.<br/><br/>
Ever since May 2014, each &amp; every article written by this guy has had Modi in the headlines and Modi's criticism is the essence of every article. All Mani does full day is watch &amp; follow Modi to get masala for his blogs. This is the age for Mani to retire. <br/><br/>
2 things that Mani can do:<br/><br/>
1.) Stop hating.<br/>
2.) Stop chamchagiri of Gandhi family.

                            Scientific temperament , this is one element that lacks in many of us probably our own educational system. Hardly, have we questioned concepts, facts laid out by our teachers at school. Conformity comes out to be as engraved value in us. Irrespective whether Mani speaks for congress or not, how do we argue the the reliability of a Modi whose foundations are entirely RSS. Mani tries to pull down not a Modi , rather a system of beliefs that the substratum nurtures. We don't have to believe either of them, but about a unbiased assessment.

How does it reflect on you indian? i dont have to say it because i see and you hear about true colors of India and its democracy everyday in Kashmir.

                            The BJP and Narendra Modi has taken it upon themselves to promote Hindi as much as 'Hindutva'. This will not stand them in good stead in the long run. Hindi is a language spoken by many people in north India, and it will give them an unfair advantage if it is promoted ahead of the other languages spoken in the country. In a globalised economy, pandering to selfish and egoistic needs like promoting a language over others will only lead to disaster in the long run. It will also alienate a lot of people.<br/><br/>
Besides, north Indians are not seen in much good light in south, east and west India. The extent to which north Indians and Hindi is hated can be seen clearly in a city like Bangalore, where many people from all over the country work and come in search of jobs. Many of the locals like the auto rickshaw drivers, cab drivers, shop keepers and others refuse to speak in Hindi even though many of them know the language. This is basically because they do not like the attitude of many north Indians who behave as if they own the whole country and that speaking in Hindi confers on them a special status. It is this high and mighty attitude of north Indians which is the most probable cause of the rise of outfits like the Shiv Sena and the Maharashtra Nav Nirman Sena in Maharashtra as well as outfits like the Kannada Rakshana Vedike in Karnataka.<br/><br/>
As long as people don't see a good reason for learning a language that will help them in the long run, no amount of coercion and promotion will help in popularizing the language. In fact, it will only lead to more opposition to the imposition of the language.
