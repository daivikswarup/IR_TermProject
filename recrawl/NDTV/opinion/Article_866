Headline::::A Giant Flop Scheme Courtesy Modi



DateTime::::2015-10-04T13:17:00+05:30



The Hindu carried on Gandhi Jayanti a hilarious colour photograph taken last year of Modi inaugurating his Swachch Bharat Abhiyan (SBA). As the PWD throws a few leaves at his feet, Modi picks up a broom, in the company of another five who also pick up their brooms - including one of his security staff - to help Modi brush aside the leaves that are so green in colour that they have clearly just been picked rather than actually fallen by the wayside. A great photo-op but illustrative of the total lack of thought that has gone into framing the allegedly "new" programme that Modi announced from the ramparts of the Lal Kila in his first Independence Day speech last year, arms flailing like a windmill but not an iota of a new idea to mark any departure from the already extant Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan. Just one more jumla to add to his already large score, designed to befool, not lead to new vistas.
 
Unsurprisingly, one year later, available information indicates that the programme is a giant flop that will never reach its target of making India "open defecation-free" (ODF) by 2019. Perhaps results might have been better if Modi had been shown, Gandhi-like, cleaning his own toilet. But even letting that pass, if Modi had shown some understanding of, and course-correcting, what was going wrong with the previous, UPA-inspired Total Sanitation Campaign, the outcomes might have been more encouraging. For, in the words of an expert, Prof. Dean Spears, "Modi's Swachch Bharat Abhiyan is essentially the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan of the previous government and the Total Sanitation Programme with a new name".
 
In the run-up to the Twelfth Plan, as this column had pointed out on the same occasion last year, numerous academic studies had established that the problem was not the building of toilets but getting the beneficiaries to use them. This is precisely what the "new" Swachch Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) should have been measuring: are Government-built toilets being used by the whole family? Instead, the SBA web-site shows that they are still building latrines without any idea of how many are being turned into cattle-sheds, how many members of a household are still going out into the open despite having in-house toilets, and why this is so. As the World Bank has pointed out in a recent survey of sanitation in India, if you measure only the physical inputs without measuring the social outcomes, you end up "manag(ing) what you can measure".
 
It does not take much to impose a toilet on a household (even if the cost of a Government toilet in India is Rs. 12,000 per unit as against Rs. 2,000 in neighbouring Bangladesh). The focus ought to be on motivating people to use the facility, removing from their minds misconceptions about purity and pollution, patiently explaining that millions of babies and children are in danger of losing their lives and their health because of open defecation in the vicinity of habitations. This is the missing element in Modi's SBA.
 
In the absence of any government surveys measuring such parameters, despite the provision in the SBA guidelines that they do so, it has been left to dedicated academics to make sample surveys to discover the truth of the matter. And what they have discovered is truly disturbing. SQUAT (Sanitation Quality, Use, Access and Trends) have found that in only 26 per cent of rural households is there no open defecation although, on a national average, over 40 percent of these households have in-house toilets. Males in large numbers, even in highly prosperous areas like rural Punjab, go into the open, leaving the in-house toilet to be used by old women and young brides.       
 
There are several reasons why this is so. The first is notions of purity and pollution - that it is "dirty" to deposit one's faeces within your own house. Such misconceptions have to be deliberately addressed at both the household and community levels. A government propagandist cannot do it; it will have to be done by the more enlightened members of the community at community meetings such as the Gram or ward Sabhas. Another is the absence of adequate running water to make it feasible to repeatedly use a toilet. This requires neighbourhood engineering solutions with day-to-day management through local 'barefoot' plumbers. Third, the absence of electricity renders most government toilets unusable. This too requires neighbourhood engineering solutions and a fleet of 'barefoot' electricians. Fourth, the mistaken but widespread belief that pit latrines will quickly fill up and then have to be manually cleaned. In fact, it takes up to five years to fill a 60 cubic feet pit. This  too requires knowledgeable local 'wise men' patiently explaining matters to households and communities. The explanations will be believed to the extent that they are carried by local advocacy groups speaking in the local dialect. Perhaps most important of all, communities have to be alerted to the dangers of open defecation, so that they clearly apprehend that the continuation of traditional practices is a serious threat to the health, indeed the very lives, of their children and other loved ones.
 
It is not just ignorance or blind prejudice that comes in the way of SBA but practical difficulties that only truly empowered Gram Sabhas and panchayats could remove by motivating the community as a whole to recognize the dangers of present practices and the advantages of altering modes of social behaviour and cultural mores. Such sanitation extension work cannot be done by sarkari babus and certainly not by exhortations of the Prime Minister bellowing at ordinary mortals through the exercise of his considerable lung power. This can only be done patiently and quietly in village after village by local leaders speaking the idiom of the common people. To make a success of SBA, we need empowered Gram Sabhas where empowered panchayat leaders are held responsible by those who elected them.
 
25 years ago, a young Prime Minister, wise beyond his years, clearly saw this. He, therefore, included "water and sanitation" in the Eleventh Schedule which contains the illustrative list of subjects that the Constitution indicates for devolution to the panchayats. It is only when  that vision is fulfilled that we will get an ODF India. Tragically, Modi does not believe in Panchayat Raj. Certainly, as Chief Minister Gujarat, he ran one of the least impressive panchayat systems in the country. Not once did Gujarat come anywhere near being declared the state with a relative good panchayat system or as a state progressing towards that goal. So, his SBA is bound to fail unless his centralizing tendencies are lobotomized. There is little hope of that, for although he jabbers on about "cooperative federalism", that is restricted to power-sharing between the Centre and the States. The panchayats, despite being the Constitutionally sanctified third tier of government, are nowhere in the picture. And until they are placed absolutely centre-stage, SBA will go nowhere.(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Dear Mani, I don't want to be uncivilised while commenting but you are absolutely wrong in your analysis, as usual. In the last one year, awareness has been created among the citizens to noylt create a mess on the streets of their towns. Initiatives like these should have been implemented around 50 years ago. I fail to understand why it hadn't been done. Now if Modi is taking a step in the right direction, we should rather be optimistic. Rome wasn't built in a day. It will take time. Swachhata will take time but I'm sure we will follow our PM to the fullest in this regard. <br/><br/>
It's high time you wrote articles impartially. Modi is the PM. Just accept it. Rahul Gandhi can never be the PM. That'd be a disaster. Follow your fellow Congressman Tharoor in this regard. He writes articles to the point.

                            Ok, all Modi schemes during the past one year are flop according to Mani. So, what of the past 60 years of schemes run by mainly his master's family? Super successful? India, China and south Korea got independence at around the same time. Look today where we are? And of course, the blame goes to Modi right, because the first family and its dynastic descendants can do no wrong ever? And by the way, since you are so emphatic that Modi must go, may we ask you to suggest and alternative? Again your answer is a predictable Rahul Gandhi. However, nobody outside the sycophants of the dynasty would want that choice.

                            Open defecation is indeed a long way away as evidenced by Mani the moron defecating yet another Modi bashing article on a hapless Indian public!  Mani's problem is that he is incensed that nobody consults him about the direction India takes.  For some reason he thinks that only what he sanctions can be implemented. To Mani, Modi was an obvious failure in Gujarat and that is why he got elected a mere 3 times.  To Mani, anything Modi is doing as PM is obviously failing as the growth rate next year will be a mere 8% and ahead of China, Europe and the USA.  To Mani, anything Rajiv Gandhi, India's most corrupt PM, did was holy.  To Mani, anything Sonia does is holy because she and Rajiv had their marriage consummated.  To Mani, anything Rahul does is holy because Rahul is the product of the aforementioned consummation. To the rest of us Indians, Mani is a moron who failed as a babu, failed as a politician, simply cannot get elected in any constituency and whiles away his time hoping against hope that Rahul will be the PM and he, Mani will be the ultimate babu; i.e., the President of India!

My sincere advice to you would be to sit back and reflect on your opinions before you put them down on paper if you wish to be seen as an honorable, honest, fair and credible writer.

One simple example is Ordinance factory Bloangir, which shows what is Indira's Congress. Worst looter than British.<br/><br/>
The only exception is Narsimha Rao, though he allwoed cooruption but did lot for nation then any other Nehru-Gandhi clan.<br/><br/>
Cming back to Modi and BJP. People were left no choice and till date Modi did not do bad except beet arrogant attitude towards opponent. but at least one thing for sure he is not corrupt. He is the only hope for India. I dont see any other promising leader.

                            Yes, we are going to critique Modi Govt for not following through on the excellent start by PM Modi. That doesn't mean anyone gives any high marks to previous Govts especially CON Govts, the did nothing. Period. This Govt is trying, may succeed some, fail some. The awareness PM Modi spread alone is Huge. It got everyone talking and paying attention. CON had no time for this beside calling Modi chuha, chaiwalla and what not. <br/><br/>
Just because we criticize Modi Govt, never assume that we any way approve what CON govt did. Expectations are much high from Modi Govt, we had no expectations from CON govt.

                            Aiyer and his pathetic small mind. Modi is trying to create order out of the chaos that was gifted to him. Is Swach Bharat a worthwhile programme or not? Should India not be a clean country? What is the point of running down a perfectly good scheme? Because no Congresswallah thought of trying to clean India? Or they could not even imagine India as a clean country? Should India always be dirty - as during Congress rule - so that it draws condemnation from the rest of the world? It is not easy. You make fun of it due to your own pathetic ignorance. Every positive thing that Modi tries to do is to benefit Indians. Whether he will succeed and to what extent time will tell. What India does not require is people like you who neither did anything, and want to pull down those who try. The old crab story. But you are not even a crab, merely a worm. So go and do obeisance to your foreign gods, and leave Indians alone. Just get lost. Jealousy and envy are never going to serve any purpose. Understand?

                            Mr. MSA, could you please write an article on what Congress government could have done better in its tenure. It is worth noting to see an article presenting the shortcomings of your tenure rather focusing on finding flaws of one person regularly. It looks monotonous for readers seeing same type of articles. <br/><br/>
By this time it is almost known that you brag yourself as the highly intelligent person in this contemporary time with great critical thinking ability on any topics in this universe. With all due respect, if you had this unequivocal analytical skills why had you failed in delivering the right solutions when you were in power?

                            I am surprised with the fact that all the wisdom of the Congress Party was never utilized to make India clean and bring sanitary values in the people.  It seems the UPA government had the vision, knew the challenges and had flawless implementation plan.  With such grand vision and know how to successfully transition India from slums to splendor, why didn't the writer and comrades go with full steam?  I forgot one important fact, he is a Congressmen and their philosophy now is to object anything this visionary PM does or plans to do to make India better.  He and his buddies have lot of time in their hands, so all they will do is write stupid articles  and ridicule our PM. Of course, this media house provides platform for such person to make such ridiculous claims.

                            Why not support the government policies and help them conduct their plans instead of just criticizing? Lets become proactive citizens and work in hand with government only then some change would occur. The role of opposition is not just to oppose but also to represent the country and help improve the situation. You can't just stand aside and yell that the plans are not working. Lets work together. You speak about past years. I think 40-50 yrs ago, those in opposition made a productive and useful group in the parliament. Why not work towards that?

That's fine: you're doing your job in that capacity by writing the SAME article 20 different ways. Unfortunately for you and your bhakti for Nehru-Gandhi clan, the only way for Congress to be relevant again is to have a different set of leaders. And you blame blind BJP bhakts for all kinds of notoriety. Well, you too, are a bhakt in your own right.

                            I don't understand Mani, toilet building started way back during congress days and since then people have been using those as a storage area. I mean, I wouldn't use those dark dinghy places with no water to take a leak. So what were u doing during your panchayat days. India is a big country with bigger problems and won't be solved so easily. PM Modi  is over enthusiastic, true. Tackling problems with a positive attitude is a virtue not a crime. The poverty and lack of education was not a legacy of his party, hope you remember.

                            Mani is right that much I can comment rationally irrespective of what the sensible people of this world say...the job of Swachha Bharat is much more tedious and requires lot of patience and organization rather than mere showbiz and noise...I am sure if not the 25 years back PM Mani has mentioned lot of earlier PMs and ministers would have given sincere thought about cleaning up India which is not an easy task - he is certainly right that repackaging Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan and a few photo-ops mixed with anti-Congress tirades is not the solution however an honest analysis of the failures in the earlier movement, logical troubleshooting, replanning and effective implementation can help achieve what the country is looking for - Modi or no Modi...I would go by my own rationale thinking and not necessarily be carried away by the unreasonable critical comments below though my comments may be slammed by many readers here !!

Whats your effort or for that matter can you ask your boss Sonia and Pappu as what they have done. Being an Indian do not degrade other citizens and enjoy by always making mockery of them. PM is doing his job. If you want to support ..  do that. Otherwise just keep quiet. It is sickening for public to read your comments . who wanted yours. Are you not ashamed.
