Headline::::An Open Letter to Yogendra Yadav From AAP's Ashutosh



DateTime::::2015-03-28T13:43:00+05:30



(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)
	Dear Yogendra Bhai
	On this historic day, I want to remember the time when I first met you. It was 1997 and the parliamentary elections results were pouring in. It was a different era - the election results used to take 72 hours to come in and Doordarshan would cover them in the minutest detail. It was in the DD studio in Khelgaon that I met you. I was a young reporter who had been given a chance for the first time to anchor live just for two hours and you were one of the panelists on my show. I was curious and restless. I was impressed with your psephological understanding and political analysis. We continued to remain in touch, though not very frequently.
	When I joined IBN7 as Managing Editor, thanks to Rajdeep, you became a permanent fixture in our election-related analysis. We had many off and on conversations regarding political developments, and we both benefited mutually. Both you and I had a huge interest in Anna Hazare's movement, and both of us were in touch with Arvind and other leaders of the movement.
	You joined AAP when a section of the movement decided to become a political party, and you became one of the founding members. A year later, I also mustered the courage to join the bandwagon and be a member. It was a curious turn to my career. This was the first time that we both had an opportunity to work together.
	I had always known you as a very polite and soft-spoken person. In contrast, I carry not so soft a demeanour myself. Slowly, I was getting to understand the nuances of politics which I had been observing as an analyst from outside. This was the time when you were very close to Arvind. He had total trust in you. You were his eyes and ears, and also the biggest trouble-shooter. This was also the time that when everybody thought that after Delhi, Haryana would be the next breakthrough state for AAP. You belonged to Haryana and had never hidden your political interest for long-term politics in the state and may have fancied yourself as the Chief Minister of the state at some time in the future.
	Now I am writing this letter at a time when you are raising the issue of internal democracy, transparency and Swaraj in the party, and according to you, the party under the leadership of Arvind has moved away from the founding principles, and it is your endeavour to bring the party back to its natural gravitational centre. In this context, I want to ask you a few questions.
	1. Is it not a fact that after the dream success of AAP in December 2013, you developed an ambition to be the anchor of the party in Haryana and you went out of your way to go to Arvind and pressurised him that you be appointed the party-in-charge for the state? Is it not true that Arvind appointed you without any hesitation to the post? Now you talk about Swaraj and consultation with volunteers as cardinal principles in the decision-making process. May I ask you, did you insist then that your appointment be made after wider consultation with volunteers? The reality is you did not. Was it not a violation of Swaraj concept?
	2. Is it not a fact that you were desperate to contest the assembly elections in Haryana and when Arvind differed with you, you became bitter? This was the time when AAP had lost the parliamentary elections badly, and our obituaries were being written in the media. And you know that Prashant and you were among the few who insisted that if AAP was to emerge as a national alternative, then the party should contest all the seats in Parliament. Arvind pleaded with you to fight only a selected few seats, but he was overruled, and everybody knows the results, and he was blamed for the loss and had to bear the brunt of the media. I was expecting that one of you would have come out and taken the blame but alas, that was not to be.
	3. Arvind was blamed for imposing his will on the party when he did not want to contest the assembly elections. Yes, he was opposed to it and he was of the opinion that in Haryana, we did not stand a chance, and we would end up like any other party, and the Haryana elections would impact the Delhi elections badly. He was right. You yourself had also admitted that AAP MIGHT NOT get more than 5% vote in Haryana. You were very insistent despite that, and finally the decision was left to the national executive which declined to go with you. Later, I was amazed to hear - and it was repeated innumerable times - that it was Arvind who bulldozed the decision. Anybody who believes in internal democracy of the party would have accepted the decision of the party by majority opinion, but you did not. May I ask - is this democracy?
	4. Is it not a fact that when the party lost the parliamentary elections, you insisted on a review of the defeat in Arvind's absence? He was in jail, and we all were sad; you were so insistent on the review that we all were surprised and felt bad. In fact, all of us had then said "what is the hurry?" and we should wait for Arvind to get out of jail, after which we could discuss the results threadbare. This was the time I felt it was not simple review which you were demanding - it was much more than that. Only history will judge what it was.
	5. It was from this point that various stories started appearing in the newspapers which were tarnishing the image of the party and also that of Arvind. Initially, these were ignored. But later, a few suspected your hand in this. You were confronted, but you denied it every time. Finally, it was decided to catch the lie, and the phone conversation was recorded with a reporter who confessed to your role. You were confronted with proof and you had no answer. In fact, you were ready for disciplinary action, and begged Arvind for a graceful exit. You knew your political journey had reached a dead end. But Arvind and the party forgave you, and no action was initiated against you thanks to the large-heartedness of the very same Arvind whom you blame now for not behaving in a democratic way.
	This story can go on and on. And real facts will come out, and also the real reason why an internal revolt against Arvind was engineered, and who were the faces behind it. But let me tell you that today, when the national council is going to meet, and take many historic decisions, I am very sad and bitter. All of us had promised to cleanse the system from all the malaise because of which politics has earned a bad name, and today,Â  when I see the same faces for whom I had tremendous respect for years, I feel let down, if not shattered. But let me also tell you, today, I am, along with thousands of volunteers, more determined to change the system for a better India. And we will succeed. There will be temporary setbacks but history is on our side.

AK is impatient, emotional, unwilling to negotiate with his colleagues, power-hungry. AK is epitome of "it is my way or highway". Time to change aam admi party to arvind admi party.

                            Another cunning piece by this guy to try to muddy the waters. Instead of giving his opinion about the real issues being raised by YY and PV, he goes off on a tangent  about Haryana  and National Elections. <br/><br/>
HOW will the party reform if they refuse to even acknowledge the problems?

                            Asutosh: is it not a fact that inspite of knowing all these "facts" much before the Delhi election you used Yogendra Yadav to win Delhi election as one of the major campaigner and the chief spokesperson  and when the goal is achieved its time to trash him away?<br/><br/>
Is it also not a fact that you always wanted the media limelight and to be the chief spokesperson of AAP in spite of being a horrible speaker yourself. So when the opportunity came  you trashed Yogendra and became chief media spokesperson though there are many other eloquent speakers in the party who are at least 100 times better in public speech and debate?

                            Let me make the first comment to Ashutosh. The difference between you and PB/YY is in intellect. And unfortunately nothing can be done about it. I don't think anyone in AAP did more damage than you. Every time you open your mouth on any news debate we would lose 10 people. if there iis one single factor which killed the spirit of AAP, it is the depth of your immaturity, impulsiveness and idiotism. But I should say your level of manipulation knows no leaps &amp; bounds. Keep it up. You single handedly manage to lose thousands of volunteers who worked day &amp; night. Congratulation &amp; go ahead. If there is anything called Karma, it will catch up with you. I shall wait for that day.

                            So you are saying that Yogendra Yadav agreed that AAP will only get 5% votes in Haryana. Yet you are saying that he wanted to be the Chief Minister of Haryana ? So he wanted to become CM of Haryana by contesting elections which he knew would end in a loss! Great logic.

                            Dear Ashotosh,<br/>
i had admired you as a Hindi Anchor on TV. However, for goods reasons, i.e. to be a member of Rajya sabha next year, you have become mouth of Mr. Arvind Kejriwal. It is sad to see the plight of a genuine person like Mr. Yogender Yadav. Ask the Delhi CM to use decent word against a person who is elder to him, if not competent, as you find him to be.

Sad day for all those who had high hopes from this party.

                            Froom "AAM AADMI" Answers to opportunistic Ashutosh's questions. Ashutosh himself is one of opportunistic who joined only after AAP made handsome debut in Delhi<br/>
(1) What is wrong in ambition in Yadav when AK49 ditched Delhi in greed to become PM <br/>
(2)Which "selected seat" you are talking about. AAP lost deposits in 99% seats they contested. <br/>
(3) Elections r not meant for winning only but to raise party base also. That was concept of AAP to become national alternate<br/>
(4)What is wrong in demanding a review after the election defeat? Do you mean "AAP" (which claim concept "sawaraj &amp; Mohalla Sabhas") is owned by Arvind &amp; some Sidekick like you? <br/>
(5) Regarding stories &amp; news in media opportunistic Mr Ashutosh was all over in social media &amp; pressconferences by one sided attack on duos

You waited like a true opportunist to join once Delhi results were out to get the parliamentary election tickets. We have now seen the true color of AAP and Kenriwal. Having tried both BJP at centre and AAP in Delhi, I'm voting for congress next time now. You break my trust..

                            How convenient for Ashutosh to accuse and convict YY and PB when his leadership did not even have the decency to approach their own internal lokpal to decide on the  on the conduct of these two individuals. How convenient that Ashutosh tries to pass off his party's deeply suspicious campaign to oust these two founding members as a campaign about targeting poor Kejriwal. How convenient that Ashutosh does not mention the fact that YY did not ask for Haryana during the recent round of talks (even though it was repeatedly offered to him). How convenient that Ashutosh publicly accuses YY of trying to "sabotage" the party and yet competely sidesteps the fact that they are the one's sabotaging it by straying away from its founding principles. How convenient that Ashutosh should talk about YY as a villain on the day they have decided to sack him, without any due process. This party from the very inception was about "Kejriwal". We did not elect Kejriwal, we elected the "idea" of swaraj. If you want to create a party where Kejriwal is "more equal than everyone else", then go ahead. At least don't be hypocrites and expect everyone to believe your lies. I predict there will be more ousters from the party in the years to come. In five year, Kejriwal will be just another politician, high on ideals and talk but low on execution. The Aam Admi Pary has now become the Arvind Kejriwal Party.

                            For a change, I agree fully what is written by this guy. There are problems in both the sides. what ever YY and PB are complaining of now, they both committed the same mistakes earlier. YY was not democratic and he had insulted so many other AAP joinees. PB deliberately wanted to increase the influence of his family members in  the party, remember 2 ppl from the same family in 5 member Anna Team to discuss the Lok pal bill with congress in 2012. And finally AK has introduced qualities of congress to his party, like high command culture, sycophancy.<br/>
All the 3 people in question (AK,YY,PB) had a successful career and their personal life is secure. It is the Delhites who are at loss and paying a high price to see this never ending reality show. DELHI JUST HAD A FALSE DAWN.

Do you even know what Prashant Bhushan has done in his life, who has he fought in his life....who are you ...what have you done in life and you question these people. You may disagree with them that is ok but you dont demean them...I think by removing them it will be the beginning of the end of your party..

                            So, Ashutosh accepts that there is no inner party democracy in his party as he tells how Yogendra Yadav was appointed Haryana convenor by Arivind Kejriwal. His only complaint is that why Yogendra Yadav is now asking for democracy. Can't he live like before in nomination culture. Entire story is thieves quarrelling for booty.

                            We all remember how you had declared grandly in the Arushi murder case that the parents did it and their was a sex angle, even before any investigation had happened! Later you tried defending your utterances in every channel debate on the subject. Why not accept that it was a mistake on your part? Just shows the mentality which you suffer from. No wonder Kejriwal keeps you close because he suffers from the problems. Birds of a feather...<br/>
AAP is a creation of a section of the electronic media. Those who live by the media die by it.

Good article, however Public &amp; Your Supporters DONT NEED to see this. <br/>
Please sort out internal mess in a Graceful way. <br/>
Yogendra and Prashant are very well respected AAP founders. <br/>
You will not be seen in good light once you remove them out. <br/>
They can always form another party with Anna H. AAP-Lokpal party <br/><br/>
Sort your mess - spare your supporters from grief.

                            Shame Shame Shame. Don't underestimate  peoples intelligence. Bye Bye AAP. Its sad and tragic. But people can see your actions Ashutosh. Don't think people are fools. Put all the following together and derive your conclusions<br/><br/>
1. Arvind says wont take support from Congress or BJP. Now it comes out he was not wanting to listen to anyone on this and was trying to concoct an arrangement. ( Thinks he is right in everything). Amounts to cheating people in my view.<br/>
2. Travels by business class. We gave him benefit of doubt.<br/>
3. Travels with a convoy of police jeeps after elections ( don't have red  beacon on his car. When you have 5-10 beacon light jeeps ahead and behind you, whats the need)<br/>
4. Lot of senior members in his government have been given bungalows. Dy CM actually moved into Sheila Dikshits bungalow. Wow. What aam aadmi party.<br/><br/>
Do you think we people are blind Ashutosh. Here 2 people are saying that we are asking AK to shift his methods as we need to uphold values. Means are as important as goals and he is not listening. You think we cant see who care more for values?<br/><br/>
PB and YY may be wrong in some aspects too otherwise this wouldn't blow up so much.I don't know that.<br/><br/>
But one thing is for sure. AK has lost it. If you didn't get it let me repeat it. AK and his TEAM HAVE LOST IT. You guys have CHEATED the PEOPLE OF DELHI AND INDIA. <br/><br/>
And bigger than that is the disservice you guys have done is to kill the expectations of people at large. No one will trust you and maybe any messiah for a long time. That's unforgivable.<br/><br/>
GET LOST.

                            Mr. Ashutsh, its just matter of time when you'd come out of AAP &amp; talk against Kejriwal.  The way you are talking for AAP (in particular for Kejriwal) all these people who are now out of APP did it quite eloquently well then.  Today they are all either facing eviction or have already come the other side opposing Kejriwal.  Kejriwal after winning triumphing majority of 67 seats in Delhi obviously wants all the senior members to go out of AAP or be expelled on some pretext for him to remain supreme and dictator of AAP.  Tomorrow you slightly oppose Kejri even you'd then experience it.   But for the word Corruption there is nothing much for AAP to offer rather Delhi people got seduced by heroism of Kejri &amp; brought him up only to see a disaster for themselves.  Lets see.  The time tells us how the AAP going to be near future and where you guys would be few months down the line.

                            Mr Ashutosh, Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan have more credibility than Arvind Kejriwal. Even for a moment, if we were believe you, what was the need to expel them from National Executive if Kejriwal enjoys such absolute majority in the party's highest decision making body. What harm could Yadav and Bhushan have done to Kejriwal if you let them be in the NC, especially when Kejriwal has over 200 NC members supporting him.

                            Ashutosh I endorse what Priya had commented earlier. Pls take these comments seriously and not label us. Ashutosh you are too adamant in  expressing your views.  You must learn how to communicate. You still do it in a authoritative manner as you had done as a news anchor. Perhaps by these blogs you are trying to create a space in intellectual abilities. Take your audience and readers as in equal level of intelligence. You utterances are damaging the party. Pls keep away for sometime from media presence.

                            see who is talking..mr. Ashutosh don't try to guide us about Shri. Yogendra Yadav Ji and his behaviour..we also know about your nature...what ever you did to come into the limelight and to grab attention...we are the masses and we know who is wrong and who is right..it is not 18th or 19th century that most people are illiterate and easily be convinced..it is also unfortunate to finally see the real intention of Mr. Kejriwal..as is evident from the telephonic conversation? yogendra yadav sir does not need any introduction but unfortunately for you people have to google search your profile..<br/><br/>
Thank you for your guidance though...but knowledge is power.

                            Ashutosh, AK has a proven track record of ditching his colleagues once they have served their purpose towards his ends. He did it with Anna, now YY and PB. Now he is fully surrounded by chamchas like you and in his comfort zone, but you will do well to remember that if ever you dared to think for yourself or, more likely, a bigger chamcha came around ( there are dime a dozen in India), you will meet similar fate. YY and PB have the skills and intellect, and command the respect to pick up the pieces and rebuild their careers, what will you and the likes of khaitan or Sanjay singh do? People like you have redefined the meaning of 'leader', who have no actual following on the ground to even win a councillor election on their own. In reality, you are all followers of a person, much like in congress. AAP was rightly called a reincarnation of congress by some, and now everyone can see why!!<br/>
Long live chamchagiri.

                            Your comment that secret ballot is against transparency is the most stupid argument I have ever heard. If voters were  asked to vote in Lok Sabha and Assembly elections through an open system of voting, what would be the outcome? <br/><br/>
Can you even begin to imagine the amount of intimidation and hatred for those who vote against the popular one? Can you imagine the amount of bullying which will be unleashed?<br/><br/>
Did you say this because due to low understanding or is it due to a crooked approach? Unfortunately you have a Hobson's choice there.

                            Ashutosh, Shocked to see this letter and it exposes you completely as a BIGGEST SYCOPHANT in AAP. I was a great admirer of your opinion and thought while you were a journalist. It seems you have sold your integrity and conscience to AK for personal gains. I must tell you that you have done a lot of harm to this party with your parochial way of thinking and sadly this seems to be the state of the party. If you have any SHAME left in you (after reading multiple comments to your open letter to YY), do a favor to yourself and to AAP by quitting AAP. You have done enough damage to AAP. You were publicly also told this on Newshour by none other than Arun Bhatia who is a supporter of AAP. You are nothing but a SYCOPHANT....

Who ever will stand by the principles the people will stand by them otherwise BJP-CONGRESS were OK.

                            @Ashutosh, Only one comment for you Just come out of your cuckoo's nest that tells you that you were an editor of media and you know everything and you are always RIGHT! After careful analysis, it is quite evident that AK is wrong and his last sting has exposed him to an impact that where he may be right people are going to doubt him. On the paper one thing is very clear that most of the Founding members of the IAC movement has walked out of this movement only with AK as a common factor in all (be it Anna, Justice Hegde etc.). Delhi scenario was perfect for IAC to capture as an only alternative to Congress and BJP due to their earlier governance issues. Now winning in Delhi does not give 'Delhi Unit' a predominance status to push their agenda on the other IAC/AAP state units. This only shows the 'Autocratic struggle' to control IAC/AAP by this Delhi Unit. This is going away from the talks on "SWARAJ, Lok-Pal, " etc. In the process of gaining the control of IAC/AAP not only in Delhi unit but extending to National level riding on the Delhi mandate. This trend is disastrous and the movement has thus clearly moved away from its main founding ethics and policies. The result is IAC/AAP has become yet another political party. This is a total betrayal to the people of India and AK and his team has to shoulder this failure responsibilities.

                            I wonder what is the contribution of Ashutosh ,Sisodia ,Sanjay Singh to AAP other than being Chamcha .The only way to save AAP is to conduct party elections democratically to elect new set of office bearers with help of neutral people .People voted for AAP not for AK and his chamchas ? The idea of AAP is greter than AK or PB or YY .All volunteers should  take role in pushing the party to conduct party elections untill then no one should be expelled from AAP? Any takers , we should invite all volunteers to DELHI on a fixed date.

If Shazia ,Yadav and PB fought in LS elections in Delhi seats APP would have got double digit MP'. We cannot allow "Chamcha" culture creep in to AAP.All oulnteers come forward we should press for party elections and new office bearers for AAP.

                            Dear Mr Ashutosh<br/>
Very humbly I must admit that U have failed AAP! Ur comments on every issues underlines how People like you degenerating the ethos and very principle for which common ppl wasted there time and energy to put U on a platform to deliver and be a symbol of change in our political system. Ppl like U stand here just for a second carrier ,which gives u power and authority. A selfless person like Mr Bhushan who has started the march ,Admiral Ramdas an honest person to the core,U guys just to accomodate more space has treated them so badly that a blind person can also see through ur dirty minds. Enjoy your 5 years in Delhi or may be less who knows. As an ordinary voter now I have no second opinion abt U. I reject U outright because of ur betrayal.<br/>
Good wishes till next election<br/>

Arvind Kejriwal has used gullible people like you to oust all the strong grass root members who had their own individual identity in the field of social activism.<br/><br/>

                            Dear Mr. Ashutosh, look at the intellect of AK &amp; team and difference between them and YY. Don't even try to send a mail to him. If you ever face him in person, you know all your AK &amp; team will not be able to justify yourself. We all have seen many debates where YY superbly handled most vocal BJP spokesperson of the party and make them mute. Did you ever get a leader like him again, no way!.  Name a single person in AK team who matches the caliber of YY, no one. It is a shame on Indian Politics that leaders like YY need to bow out in front of those people who does not have substance and value. With rising AAP, those who thought that Indian politics will change for good are in belligerent mood now. With YY and PB, you lost all serious thinking volunteers of AAP too.  Good Luck to YY. Doomsday for AAP. #GodBlessDelhi

Actually all these Ashutosh, Sanjay Singh, Ashish are sycophant and will show Kejru door soon. As far as this open letter, YY and PB have already explained most of it in last press conference. Only Ashutosh lacks intellect to understand or is foolish enough to ask questions answered already.

                            If the sting is true and Arvind Kejriwal said that he'll leave AAP with his MLAs and create another party e.g Akela + Angrakshak Party. He is the one who reeks of arrogance. Whatever be his frustration or mental state, but he cannot deny that he said it, and when a person is angry, he speaks the truth about how he really feels. AAP is a party of volunteers created a alternative to the dirty politics of existing parties. AK is a person who cannot work with other leaders. He is easily threatened. He should keep up his word and float his own party and rule over Delhi for as long as he possibly can, and Ashutosh, you and the other jokers who joined AAP just before the Delhi elections should remain in that new party created by AK, not AAP. AAP is not AKs personal property, he was only the face of the party till his true nature became public, only now, unfortunately, after the Delhi elections. PB and YY and other founding members and volunteers in other state units should move the courts if need be. Jai Hind.

                            Ashutosh, let me tell you YY is one of the best leaders you had. He used to make most of vocal BJP leaders mum in TV debates. He is one of the most knowledgeable and principled political leaders I have ever seen. Those AAP leaders who are with AK today, most of them lack substance including you. I don't find any of you will able to carry it forward to make it at national level. People of Delhi has to bear the AK &amp; team tantrums for next 5 years, I wish them good luck. Nothing is going to change for people of Delhi. All the AK &amp; team will definitely flourish for next 5 years. Ak stoop so low that he uses these derogatory words to his own colleagues. I knew he can go low, as we saw him doing during election playing caste cards, but up to this level. Our all hope for changing indian politics comes to standstill. #GodBlessDelhi

One group has all the people who doesnot have any different personalities and simply look like a bunch of messengers. While in YY &amp; PB group every member though critical of Arvind, are exhibiting indipendent &amp; original thinking. Who ever be d culprit but it is now proven that it is Arvind cannot talk &amp; work with YY &amp; PB. Prior to this incident many others respected members left d party and raised d same issue. The point to be noted is that not even once the close associates of arvind has raised any doubt and asked question on Arvind attitide. Truth is there for everyone to see.

I think, they chose to keep mum in the benefit of party and later once AAP won, they came to discuss on these so called internal matters. Please appreciate their support and silence they maintained before election or else you guys know you wouldn't have got this verdict.

Clearly you know that your only chance of being anything is by becoming a side kick of AK. If it means you need to become a shameless liar, you seem to be prepared to do it. What a fool I feel to have become a AAP volunteer. No wonder everyone is ridiculing me.

                            Aap has essentially undergone metamorphosis from an experimental idealism in politics to crass cynicism. It has become a party of bouncers and motley crowd of hooligans. Ashutosh is merely a drummer boy of Kejariwal churning fallacious fiction and journalistic cover up for the malaise in Aap

                            Ashutose I don't know wherther you read this comment or not but I will give answers which you have raised. I don't you or Yoghandra very much. But i have read the stories about Bhusan. What he has been doing is very valuable to our socieity. <br/><br/>
1. Why AAP have to accept Yogandra's demand? State party has to decide about it's CM candidate. Anybody can help the party to grow in particular state, only states person can have more knowledge about it's issue. Why AAP did not implement Swaraj. If it is implemented You doesn't need ask this question.<br/>
2. Anybody wants to contest assembly election. I believed AAP had system to choose right candidate. That system has to decide the candidates. AAP lost in elections din Parliamentary elections don't forget it's vote share went up. AAP cares about only winning election. Actually Parliament election AAP reached every where in India. That's why you got 4 MP's in Punjab.<br/>
3. Why NE has to reject to contest assembly elections in Haryana? Haryana State AAP have to take any decisiopns concerning to it's state. That's is appropriate way, remember AAP was not other party. Now we cannot say that.<br/>
4. Arvind is a main vote puller in AAP no body can deny that fact. Why AAP needs Arvind to take every decisions? He is one of mhe Main member. AAP is not capable to take decisions?<br/>
5. Yogandra or Arvind or Others may be wrong. We cannot expect them right at all times. That's why we need transparency, accountability, inner party democracy. <br/><br/>
Finally every body have to remember AAP is not a one man party. If Yogandra made mistake you had to discussed that in NE or PAC when yogandra was in PAC or NE. Without participating in parliament election how can you know AAP have good chance in Punjab. Remember you cannot replicate Delhi in every states. That will take time for that contesting elections are the only options. Even though Delhi is state it is big corporation at present AAP has presence in Metro cities. Now that is also wasted.

                            Thank you for pouring your heart out. Yogendra Yadav has lost every iota of respect. I am amazed that he has the nerve to make statements to media while masterminding a ploy to sabotage AAP. I wonder what the game plan is. YY will not draw any mileage from this rhetoric.<br/><br/>
This too shall pass. YY anf PB will soon be forgotten. AAP must stay focused on their goal. They have a lot of ground to cover as the make strides to introduce honesty and accountability in goverment.<br/><br/>
Good wishes to AK and AAP and all law abiding citizens of India. Looking forward to the positive changes.

                            A very traditional and selfish way of thinking, the once which made congress a democratic dictator of India. If people like you , and there are many, not stop thinking about Person and not principle, country is bound to have  no change in politics. I seriously feel Janta Party , Janta Dal and possibly now AAP all are results of the same  weakness of our country men, where we start with principle and end up being followers and salve of people

                            Ashutosh, The countdown for the day has begun when you will also be fired from the party after AK has used you (Actually he would have realized by now that you are actually worth nothing as you are only a CHAMCHA) and then you will write "An Open Letter to Kejriwal"....... That would be fun na.. Waiting for that day.. Actually it might come sooner that expected.

                            Honestly, after reading this I feel Ashutosh you are no more than a puppet controlled by Kejriwal. It seems you have now taken the position what you say was held by YY - Ear though additionally you also have a big mouth. I would sincerely request you to focus on what you are suppose to do just state the facts on NEWS rather than "BE THE NEWS".

                            YY is the main reason for all this. In Nov. or Dec 2013 some reporter during a PC asked YY that whether he  will be a candidate or not for Delhi'13 elections ?  YY said  that he was not interested in electoral politics. He joined AAP just to extend support for a political  alternative. Then the reporter again asked  whether in future   ? He replied "NO" and when asked why , YY replied " It takes 30-40 years for any party to come up , he is already 50 and after 30 years he will be too old " . At that time YY may not have expected the results. But when AAP won 28 seats , may be YY would have changed his mind  and  have started working on  some plan for himself. That is not at all a problem . <br/>
The only thing which hurts  today that he adopted a very mean tactic to fulfill his wishes. AK is millions times better than YY and YY also knows it . He knows that he can never be a mass leader so it is better to work from the top and he started convincing SB, PB and other senior like minded people against AK. Just wait for few more months the same people who supported YY will realize it and will regret because they have  lost their credibility in this game without any reason.<br/>
YY's greediness has spoiled the environment in AAP. AK has taken very much right decision  to kick him out because YY just wants to rush.

There were plenty of expectations on IAC movement. But you and few others spoiled it completely with your behavior. Like many others, I was also hoping that India will change some day through this movement and their subsequent entry into politics. Now I am saying without any hesitation, NO, you guys don't have that caliber to change India, rather power has changed you completely. Enjoy your day..man

                            Mr.Asthush internal democracy is an unholy in Indian polity . Is n't it ? Party is separate from the same party ruled administration. Even BJP is not a common man party that party PM is not the leader of the party. AAP is a party with different .How can you say all party as well state power to be looked after with one Man .How can AKJI look after date to today affairs of both party and CM administration ? Party is heading towards anarchy system just like congress was going during the era of  Indiraji while sacking the king maker kamaraj from the party. You like people should do the work for party unity instead you take the other side.

                            Does anyone take this jumped up 'journalist' seriously?  His standard of English is terrible yet he writes blogs in English.  His analysis of what is happening on the ground within AAP is terrible yet he pontificates about this.  However, long may he continue doing what he does; he is after all, helping to bury the organisation that was created with much hype but is in reality just a bunch of air heads.

                            Dissent is part of any democratic institution which needs to be understood. By killing the difference u have killed the party. The logic for expulsion is childish. If AAP cannot manage itself then it can hardly take care of the people of Delhi. I'm ashamed to say we supported u at some time. U have betrayed the people of delhi

                            AAP has become a party of sychophants and yes men who have to agree with Arvind completely or they go.This ugly episode  has completely damaged AAP .No man with a little intellect wll choose Kumar Vishvas and Sanjaysingh to Yogender yadhav and Prashant Bhushan.Also, is this the way senior party leaders, because of whose efforts you are where u are, be treated.Today, we are ashamed to belong to this Gunda party, where has all the idealism gone. With this episode AAP will see people quitting the party in a big way.Reformative politics is what we voted AAP for, not this kind of holligism, also your denying the episode will not help.It was the duty of you leaders to stop this happen, the whole meeting could have been conducted in a more democratic manner.We see signs of Modi in Kejariwal, who wants to take all credit for his victory.AAP today is a disgrace.
