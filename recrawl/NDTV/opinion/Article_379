Headline::::Obama Had Pointed Message for Modi 2.0



DateTime::::2015-01-28T14:29:00+05:30



(Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 14 books, including, most recently, Pax Indica: India and the World of the 21st Century.)It is hard not to read President Obama's speech yesterday as a clear message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and India's new ruling dispensation, to balance the generous praise he had ladled out to his interlocutor since he arrived in New Delhi."India will succeed so long as it is not split along the lines of religious faith," Mr. Obama said at Siri Fort Auditorium. If some saw that as an implicit rebuke to the Hindutva brigades, it was at least a reminder that while Mr Modi's past, which saw him endure a visa ban to the US for a decade, has been forgiven, it has not entirely been forgotten.Obama was, of course, polite, couching his praise of religious diversity as a mutual strength of both India and the U.S, and speaking of his own challenges as a politician with the middle name of Hussein in a country increasingly hostile to Muslims. Many Obama critics in the U.S. allege that he is a Muslim, not a Christian, the President acknowledged. "As you may know, my faith has at times been questioned-by people who don't know me-or they've said that I adhere to a different religion, as if that were somehow a bad thing," he said.The President could hardly have been unaware, of course, that India's new Prime Minister has had a long track record of implying that belonging to a different religion than his own is indeed a bad thing - and that he depends for his political success on the support of people who have variously wanted all non-Hindus to convert "back" to the mother faith or be driven out of the country. Obama's message was pointed: if India did not resolve the problems that were dividing the country, Mr Modi's proclaimed ambitious development plans would be thwarted. It is a message many of us in the Opposition have also been giving Mr Modi. But coming from the US President, whose visit is being hailed by the Government as a diplomatic triumph and whose "bromance" with the Indian PM has seen first names and much friendly banter, it is a pointed reminder of the fundamental contradiction at the heart of Mr Modi's regime.As I spell out in my new book India Shastra, Mr Modi's speeches and rhetoric appear to recognize, and harness, a vital shift in our national politics from a politics of identity to a politics of performance; yet he has ridden to power at the helm of a party, the BJP, which is ill-suited to the challenge of delinking India's polity from the incendiary issue of religious identity on which it had built its base. So he stays silent while some of his own ministers speak of Ramzadein and Haramzadein, another asks Modi opponents to emigrate to Pakistan, and church burnings and re-conversion campaigns in the name of "ghar vapasi" intimidate minorities across the country. It would have been impossible for Mr Obama - who after all has to be accountable to a domestic constituency of liberals in the US -- to remain silent in the face of such well-documented provocations.Americans have clearly noticed that Mr Modi's rise to office, which he is wisely selling to his visitor as the Indian equivalent of the American dream, has empowered the khaki-shorts wearing "cultural organization", the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), whose views on every subject - economics, politics, history, culture, morality, gender relations, even matters of appropriate dress or conduct -- are totally illiberal.Â  A party dependent on people who urge Hindu women to have four children - no, ten!, says another leader - not only shows profound disrespect to Hindu women (who have to endure the labour to fulfil these people's political fantasies) but alienates the Western and Arab investors without whom Mr Modi's agenda cannot be fulfilled. The tensions between the two tendencies - the economic reformism preached at the top and the cultural nativism that animates the majority beneath - have begun to affect the Government's agenda. What makes it worse is that the political majority needed by the Prime Minister to pursue his economic policies relies entirely on the political campaigns and organizational capacity of the very people whose chauvinism is undermining him.Mr Modi has built his appeal by putting the focus on what the Indian people manifestly need - more development, better governance, wider socio-economic opportunities. But having won an election by attracting voters to these themes, he has given free rein to the most retrograde elements in Indian society, who are busy dividing the country on Hindu chauvinist lines. Mr Modi cannot be oblivious to this fundamental contradiction, but he can only resolve it by jettisoning the very forces that have helped ensure his electoral victory. He won't, of course, which is why Mr Obama's pointed remarks were a necessary warning.Of course Indians don't need an American visitor to tell them to uphold the ideal of freedom of religion. Respect for religious diversity is deeply embedded in our culture and reified in our Constitution. As I have long argued, Indian democracy is all about the management of diversity, and if we didn't respect our diversity we could no longer be the India that Mahatma Gandhi fought to free.But for the first time, India has elected a Prime Minister who was himself named for "severe violations of religious freedom" in reports by the U.S. State Department from 2002 onwards, refused an American visa and banned from entering the United States. Mr Modi wasn't elected PM for condoning violence against minorities, but to fulfil an aspirational development vision he effectively articulated. Mr. Obama's speech was a way of telling him he can't do that without abandoning his old religious intolerance that earned him those American strictures. In other words, that the US supports the goals of Modi 2.0, but warns him he will fail if he reverts to Modi 1.0.The problem is that the dominant strand in the ruling party cares much more about asserting Hindu chauvinism than it does about the economic reforms and investments that Mr Modi trumpeted - and which won him the support of voters who did not share his "Hindutva" agenda. That agenda, however, is undermining the economic agenda. Investors are looking with mounting concern at Mr Modi's inability to manage this contradiction in his own support base. Foreigners are particularly concerned. As negative press increased abroad, potential investors have begun to feel skittish. "What to think about the recent anti-Christian and Muslim tirades and conversion propositions?" one of them, Lorenz Reibling of the German-American firm Taurus Investments, asked me on the verge of committing a major investment to India. "Conversion and ethnic/religious cleansing doesn't ring well here in Germany particularly. The bizarre dream of a 100% Hindu India would be an India with little or no foreign support. That is not what India deserves." He added, in an email: "I doubt the Middle Eastern investors would welcome an anti-Muslim policy either. They could react by turning off the $-spigot. Europeans and Americans certainly would scale back considerably if Christians are exposed to an inquisition in reverse."The Prime Minister finds himself in an invidious position in relation to his own supporters: he can't live with them and he can't live without them. But Mr Obama's speech adds a presidential voice to what many investors abroad are already saying. The warning bells have already rung. Let us hope Mr Modi is listening.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            We indians are made to believe that POTUS is a huge success. I just  looked at only few photos available of Obama in Saudi Arabia in their medias. Amazing to see in one of the photos, the same US President stooping little with head down and both fingers together giving utmost respect one can give to new Saudi King. I am sorry Mr. Modi, somehow I felt dignified during MMS visit but feeling little embarassed now as an Indian.

                            Three questions: <br/>
1) how many Hindus are converted to Christians per year in India?<br/>
2) how many Christians are converted to Hindus per year in India?<br/>
3) Whether Hindus are promoting original Christians to embrace Hinduism or asking for recent converts to come back?

                            Dear Tharoor, it is very clear that, as much as our hostile neighbour, Congress too is spooked on Obama visit and the achievements by Modi. Understandably, Congress is highly desperate to pick some negative issues out of this Obama visit and started blabbering on what Obama did not say.  Presence of different religions is an inherent and unique feature of our wonderful country and he just emphasized it.  Please do not go beyond what he said and add your imaginations to mislead the country.  Do something positive and try to win back people's faith, and not by such drama.  Is it a pure co-incidence that the articles of yours and your new found love's from across the border are published at same time with equal amount of disdain ???!!!

                            I am confused. I am unable to grasp the "intellectual" discourse that Mr. Throor is putting forward. <br/>
1) Is Mr. Tharoor against conversion per se? <br/>
2) If yes, then why can't he convince his party to support Anti-Conversion Bill proposed by Govt? <br/>
3) Or Is he only against certain types of conversion like Ghar-wapsi? <br/>
4) Is he in favor of religious freedom &amp; propagation of faith? <br/>
5) If yes then, does he support VHP also doing it? <br/>
6) If no, then can he call himself SECULAR in true sense of the word ? <br/><br/>
Question Questions Questions &amp; more Questions? No wonder, I am not in Intellectual class like Mr. Tharoor!!

                            The Congress party was majorly responsible for dividing India along religious lines with their minority vote bank politics, India's pluralism which thankfully ST has adduced to predates our so called secularism by more than 5000 years much before other monotheistic religions were around. The fact that POTUS had to address his domestic audience is conveniently ignored by ST. Besides going back on the visa issue half truths do not win an argument and if the US was so principled why did it bend over backwards to welcome Modi to the US and why did Obama accept an invitation at such short notice that is least expected from a US President. The secularists have one more peg to hang their secular coat on.

The author should also understand that funded religion conversions happening in India also very well covered in the address by Mr.OMABA. Most media and commentators fail to consider what has been happening for so long for many decades. It is a simple statement that co-existence will be helpful for development. Even BJP winning and Mr.Modi's personal winning happened  and happening in the various state elections is proving beyond doubt that BJP and MR.Modi is practicing is TOLERANCE. THAT IS THE REASON THE OUTCOME OF THE POLLS WERE IN FAVOUR OF THE BJP AND MR.MODI. PSEUDO TOLERANCE has been given a beating and that is also given in the election results.

                            First of all we are fortunate enough to be a part of a country, in which anyone can present his/her view independently whether it is with or against the govt. Now about the blog, i would say few points are right like because of unnecessary statements by some of Modi's ministers, development work is getting affected and he has to take care of it as early as possible Not just development but we need an better environment of equality as well. Few points are wrong like reiterating issues of 2002 and visa denial etc because that chapter is closed and all have moved on so no need to repeat it. All we need is some kind of constructive politics to be played by both govt as well as opposition.

Obama has some good image about modi and they know he will praise Modi about new vision. So they are most worried and Sonia is from Italy hence Obama definitely will have a soft mind about her..congress was playing minority card doing lot of favours to them...so the minority were enjoying during congreress period.. so all the minorities are on worry now. Rahul was prime minister candidate then why cant he directly meet Obama...instead he took her mom to meet Obama since she is from Italy....

                            The only advice PM Modi needs is to ignore the likes of Tharoor who feel naked unless they have churned out a few hundred words without putting in any deep thinking.  Modi did not gain more votes than the entire population of the USA by being a fascist as has been alleged by Tharoor, Jairam Ramesh, Aiyar and other members of that motely crew that gathered around Queen Sonia.  Modi was given the people's trust because they saw in him an Indian who was proud to be an Indian.  Unlike Tharoor, Modi did not feel the need to grovel to the likes of the dreadful parivar that had colonised India following the departure of the British.  India became truly independent in May 2014 when the yolk of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty was lifted from a weary, oppressed Indian people.  That freedom will endure regardless of the attempts of the parivar loyalists to regain their dominance.  India will not be diverted from its goals by the ill advised and ill timed comments of a few bit-part players.  Tharoor can rest in peace that India is in good hands and such rest may be taken either at home, in the 7 star Leela Hotel or even Tihar Jail.

Its actually Mr. Tharoor (read Congress) who is creating a divide by passing such one-sided and biased statements. Has he not heard non-hindutav brigades passing statements of intolerance towards others. Probably Mr. Tharoor keeps such information from penetrating him by covering his ears and eyes.<br/><br/>
I want to know why is it a crime to belong to a majority group in this country. Are all other groups perfectly harmonizing except for the majority group. In fact, I have time and again, and in greater frequency, heard separatist statements from other minority groups.<br/><br/>
I would have accepted Mr. Tharoor's opinions if he would have heard Obama's comments as an indication for all Indians to act in unity and be tolerant to others. But instead Mr. Tharoor wants to use the statement to feed the populist approach used by Congress that majority groups are bad and evil and minority groups are suppressed and tormented.<br/><br/>
Mr. Tharoor, I do not agree with you. I think India has done quite well in balancing its diversity, and all religions, castes, etc. have contributed in that. Singling out majority group for being rogues in this country is as wrong as singling out a religion for all the violence happening in the world right now.

                            Whatever Obama said in this context cant just be reflecting to 7 month old organization and Sashi needs to understand that. <br/><br/>
The fact is that we still talk about 2001 riots (even not remembering what happened before those riots in a train) because there was nothing else that happened later on in Gujrat. And almost all other incidents that killed several innocents happened in the states that were ruled by Non-BJP. As I was growing old in Hyd and AP, I saw many atrocities that always happened when Congress was ruling. Whenever TDP was ruling the law &amp; Order was in control. <br/><br/>
Let congress review the statistics and check where was the problem.

                            Any thing which supports freedom whether it is education, faith or speech will get a thumps up. Religion also which gives freedom will win. for some it is hindu, for some it is muslim, for some it is christianity. let us follow Article 25 and leave faith to individuals. But forced conversion by any religion is a criminal activity.

                            People like Tharoor only know are crazy. He should go back and resolve his life issues before commenting or even thinking about writing.<br/><br/>
When our PM is being totally inclusive, it is these stinky guys that want to be divisive by reading too much between and in the lines

                            One cannot but agree with Dr.Sashi Tharoor has to say vis-a-vis President Obama's last minute words. Our PM Modi has the unenviable task of biting off more than he can chew-per se. Or as the old saying in Malayalam goes" he has caught the tiger by its tail- he can neither let go nor hold on ".  The whole point before the second largest party in India today is whether they want to rule and deliver the goods or become  part of history's discardings, and allow Bharath Mata , their favorite God, to linger in pain. Let us all hope that Modi is still in a position to hold off all these Conservative/orthodox mad hats in their silly shorts and white shirts from destroying what he achieved single-handedly in 2014.

                            We Indians have no business to debate religion of President Obama.Thid is his personal  matter.Any debate on this issue is undesirable.,more  so, in the light of his address to youth community in Town Hall wherein he made a strong appeal to India not to discriminate people on the basis of their religion or faith.<br/>
not to discriminate people on the basis of their religion or faith.

                            One very interesting thing I have noticed on social media...BJP and its party men including PM are demean left and right by people. I think there is so much of hate for PM and his party men. Sometime I wonder PM and his party men will have to give their heads to pacify people and nullify their hate as proof that they treating everyone equal. Because people expect that PM should give statement on every fringe elements (who have no say..sometime they are just 1 or 2 people) actions as well. I think so much of hate for PM on this basis is not good for any country. We should respect mandate and should be a good and cool observer as well. We cannot demean a person just because other are saying something.

                            Really all these congress leaders always created vote banks creating  a scare of Hindu Backlash if BJP voted to power .. Now even after 8 months in power the country did not see much of attack on minorities ...but nation looked with fear how all the bombs blown had some minority tag attached to it knowingly or unknowingly ... how despite staying in India some guys acted for some terror outfits working from outside India ...Even an inconsequential programme done by a splinter group is making a big story to criticise PM where as none advises terrorists to behave themselves .Mamatha, Yadavs all will arrest terrorist only under absolute pressure .. Obama's speech is being read too much by congressmen where as they never endorse Modi even moderately in his capacity to balance the world leaders with a business precision ..

                            I find Obama more religiously active than Modi, he was (or may be is) a follower of that pastor out of Chicago who spits venom in religious garb.
