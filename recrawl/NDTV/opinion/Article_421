Headline::::AAP Disappoints On This Front



DateTime::::2015-02-17T12:41:00+05:30




                                
	(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)
	The absence of a woman in the six-member AAP ministry after its stupendous victory in Delhi is disappointing.
	The explanation that it is because of the legal limit of seven in the number of ministerial berths (implying thereby that there is no woman who would qualify as a choice in the first list) sounds familiar.
	There is always a justification. We are told that women will be included in important roles in the Chief Minister's Office, where policy decisions will be made. Here, we see a novel extension to the political sphere of domestic cultures of women's invisible work: behind every successful man there is a woman, in this case, behind every successful government are women.
	 
	The AAP government shares these laurels with seven such other brother state governments, where there are no women ministers.
	A study conducted by activist Bhanupriya Rao shows that there are 569 Ministers in state governments in India, among whom only 39 are women - that is just seven per cent. In state Assemblies, out of 4120 MLAs, just 9 per cent, or 360 legislators, are women.
	The record in the other three states which went to the polls after the Lok Sabha elections and before the Delhi elections has hardly improved, except for Haryana, which now has 13 women MLAs in the Assembly compared to nine the last time. Maharashtra does not cross even 6 per cent, with just 16 women MLAs in the 288 member Assembly. The Jharkhand Assembly has nine women members. In Maharashtra, there is one woman in the cabinet and one Minister of State; Jharkhand and Haryana have one woman member each in the cabinet.
	Political parties across all divides have failed to break the barriers based on discrimination that result in under-representation of women in elected positions and in decision-making bodies, including in ministerial positions. On the contrary, some political parties and leaders have actively contributed to strengthening patriarchal political cultures. There has been a regression in the levels of political discourse.
	Sexist and gender-demeaning statements ranging from threats of rape against women political opponents in Bengal to objectionable statements regarding women journalists by a member of the present government hardly provide an environment conducive to women's equal space in politics. One dimension influences the other. The negligible number of women in elected bodies itself creates an environment where misogyny thrives, while such an environment further strengthens discriminatory practices against women.
	In today's obsession with models of good governance, it is important to reiterate that the macho definitions of good governance that we are currently being subjected to tend to entirely push social justice issues off the political agenda. In fact there can be no good governance which is not based on ethically and morally sound social justice policies, including at its heart policies which address and fight against all aspects of social discrimination based on gender, caste and community.
	In spite of the direct and indirect  assault against reservations for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes from many quarters, including sections of the judiciary, India's democracy has been strengthened if not saved, by the instrument of reservations, which has brought at least a semblance of justice to the Dalit and tribal communities, even as other aspects of the iniquitous caste system mock on a daily basis at India's Constitutional provisions against discrimination. The present system of reservations at least protects a minimum number of seats for Dalits and tribals, proportionate to the share in the population.
	Women's position cannot of course be compared to that of oppressed castes and communities. Women are not a homogenous group. The class and caste differentiations among women are self-evident. Dalit and tribal women, women of the working classes face many levels of discrimination, oppression and exploitation over and above  gender-based discrimination. However, it is equally undeniable that women as a whole have faced discrimination in many fields by virtue of their sex. Politics is one such sphere.
	Global experience has shown that without legal or Constitutional mechanisms, the gender gap in politics in Parliamentary democracies can rarely be overcome. With just 22 per cent of women in Parliaments as the global average, many countries are adopting Constitutional measures to include women. According to recent research published by IDEA International's Global Data Base of Quotas, half of the countries in the world today are using one form or other of quotas and Constitutional mandates to push more equal gender representation.
	It may be considered ironical that male-dominated Parliaments across the world have the responsibility of changing a scenario they themselves have created. But it is feasible precisely because the adoption of mechanisms to provide for more equitable representation for women goes beyond the stereotypical male-female divide into a debate to strengthen democracy, and therefore benefit society in general.
	India had taken the initiative through the reservation for women in seats in local urban bodies and in the three-tier panchayat system. Unfortunately, the tremendous benefits accruing from this reservation system in unleashing the energies of communities of women across the country have been unfairly underestimated, both in terms of the power it has given to women in decision-making bodies as well as the changes this has wrought in social relations at the grassroot level, not quantifiable perhaps, but certainly discernible. It was a politically sound approach to ensure a wider base at the village and local level, rather than starting at the top with quotas in Parliament.
	 
	However, more than two decades after this successful project, the absence of women in the Assemblies and Parliaments is even more glaring. After sustained pressure from women's movements and their supporters, the UPA passed the Women's Reservation Bill in the Rajya Sabha in March 2010 on the occasion of International Women's Day. The distance from the Rajya Sabha to the Lok Sabha takes five minutes to cross. But five years later, the Bill has not moved an inch. The total lack of political will is the highest barrier.
	 
	The Modi Government has a single-party majority. It need not concern itself with apprehensions of the lack of numbers required for a constitutional amendment. On the fifth anniversary of the passage of the Women's Reservation Bill this March, the Modi Government should redeem its pledge and bring the Bill for adoption and passage in Parliament. Only then can we ensure that the voice of India's women will be heard in the institution that the Prime Minister described as the temple of democracy which equally applies to state Assemblies. This will, in turn, lead to a situation where no Party can form a Ministry without the inclusion of women.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Why Indians always complain and do very little. The fact of the matter is. If you are hiring a employee for your company. Your requirement is that the person increase your sales to 5%. Now if that employee turns out to be a man. Then so be it. If you hire a female for the sake of hiring a female. That's unfair and inefficient. The idea is to, create a ground where a woman can also compete and do as well as men or better. Then no body will need to hire a woman because she is a woman. THey will hire because she is integral and important. Therefore no discrimination and it will be fair. Please come to Hong Kong and see how its done. You are living in dark age in India. Sorry to say that. But its true.

                            The problem lies with women themelves.Most of the women who are in politics are not because of their work and merit but because they are the sisters, daughters,wives or mistresses of the men in power. Let women come into their own on their own steam. Demanding that there should be women just to fill berths is the most archaic and illogical argument from brainless idotic thinking.

                            Yes, Ms Karat. Having you as the Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha, India did a lot of development. Didn't it? You and your party should learn to keep extremely quiet because you guys are complete failure when it comes to politics or governance. Please show one place where it helped CPI(M) to have you, a female member in the party. Did West Bengal performed excellently in development of its state during its 3 decades rule? Did the condition of women in West Bengal improved drastically because you a female member was in the party. Please for God sake first get your house in order before you point fingers at others.

                            The point raised by Ms. Karat is right and I support it in principal. At the same time I am saddened to see most of the CPM leaders of today indulging in five star politics in the Power corridor of Delhi. The party is facing extinction in Bengal and the top leaders are not bothered at all. Left parties have a rightful place in Indian politics and I am sad to see them fade away because many of their leaders have stopped their grass root politics. It is definitely much harder than to stay in Delhi and visit the party HQ every day to have some discussion.

                            Really she did  a good exercise to explain all about non representation of women in Parliament or Executive ...With the recognition free economy it is only natural that the competition will be so rampant in all walks of life , naturally the gender will not be a calibration point in selctions where as  it will be sheer capability and efficiency  ..There are so many Women CEOs who have reached their companies top by sheer hard work may be little amount of support from interested elements ..She should first tell how the women are treated in her own party...Why women in film industry getting notoriously famous...Why advertisements select women even if they have nothing to do with the product ..There is a willful attempt to commoditise women and no Women organization raise any banner of revolt against this ..Even she has not done anything for women empowerment except lip service without sincerity

                            BJP offered a woman Chief Minister in Tough Cop Kiran Bedi. But it appears even women do not want a woman CM so what can we do. Though AAP has a lot of capable women some every good ones left to Join BJP.  AK prefers muscular Dharna Politics so you get a Muscular Delhi Cabinet. So Delhi women want a Muscular Man to be the Guardian and they do not trust a woman to be capable of that. Hard Luck. Not serious but in jest.

                            Let me start by saying I'm a guy, and I'm all for women empowerment and all that, but I hate it when people, especially women, make this argument. <br/><br/>
I'm sorry, but for me, simply saying 'there are no women in a 7-member cabinet' isn't a good enough argument. Now if there was ever a clear case of discrimination against a woman, for no reason other than the fact that she was a woman, then I would whole-heartedly join you in your tirade.<br/><br/>
But in the absence of such evidence, I see the lack of women in the cabinet as being due to other, less persecutory reasons. One of the most obvious being that there simply are a lot fewer women in politics than men. I'm not saying this is a good thing or a bad thing, I'm simply saying this the way things are at the moment. <br/><br/>
Again I'm not advocating abject majoritarianism. But when Kiran bedi was part of the India against corruption movement I heard her say a lot of things, but being discriminated against for being a woman was not one of them.<br/><br/>
The selection of the cabinet should be based only on merit and nothing else. Having a woman for the sake of having a woman would be mere tokenism; A 'reservation'. And I think that's insulting to women.<br/><br/>
(God knows this reservation rubbish has already trashed our education system completely. And no, I'm not from a forward caste. The government of India considers me 'backward'.)<br/><br/>
Again, I'm all for women empowerment and women in politics. But its this mindless pseudo-feminism that I can't stand.

                            There are three kinds of people in this world. The smart person who learns from other's mistake, the common person who learns from his / her own mistake and the fool who never learns.It seems the CPM will never learn. Tokenism has been the bane of our polity since independence. Founding father Ambedkar himself was dead against reservations.In the last four decades the CPM has promoted and mastered mediocrity in all spheres and destroyed the Bengali society amongst others. Thankfully in Bengal they have been sent packing. A person's place in a team must be on merit and without any bias towards race,gender,faith,wealth or any such prenatal attributes on which we mortals have no control. It is hoped that then AAP leadership shall definitely induct persons from the fairer gender over time in the Delhi cabinet but it is best done on merit and merit alone.

                            @Anna: well, no-reservation is an ideal alternative but only in a society which is honest enough towards the upliftment of underprivileged sections. Reservation is a necessary compromise between quality and social welfare but for areas with real-time implications such compromise could prove to be disastrous. So we definitely need to keep some exceptions while reserving quotas.
