Headline::::Government Failed Totally In Defusing JNU Crisis



DateTime::::2016-02-17T13:54:00+05:30




                                Writing on the recent incidents at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is not easy. There are several phenomena involved. As such, any piece of writing on such a subject will inevitably be complex. It will leave some readers in agreement with some of the assessments being made, but not with others. It will also require stitching together disparate themes.
Let us consider the episode, then, not in terms of a chronological narrative but as a function of the role of and impact on the various stakeholders. To this writer's mind, there are five principal sets of stakeholders:
- The government and Delhi police
- The students and others gathered for the now infamous February 9 incident on the JNU campus
- The JNU community (admittedly an omnibus and inaccurate word, but more of that later)
- Political parties
- The media
How did each of these do?1. The government and Delhi police: In terms of communication and outreach, inability to anticipate and defuse a crisis, and ineptitude in political management, the Narendra Modi government has set some sort of a record in the past 20 months. It has repeated many of the same mistakes over and over again.
It was no different this time, when the government failed spectacularly despite wider public sympathy not being with the "Afzal Guru Death Anniversary Commemoration" event at JNU. The use of the sedition charge against a JNU student was over the top. Sedition is a blockbuster expression that has been used and misused by various government over the years, in a variety of countries. It leaves most modern democracies uncomfortable. Indeed, many of the criminal acts considered seditious can be tried under various other laws - from hate speech laws to defamation laws to, in an extreme case, terrorism laws. As such, the efficacy and necessity of a sedition law is doubtful. To use it following a speech, however objectionable that speech may be, is difficult to defend.
That apart, the government was slow if not comical in presenting evidence of what it called the conspiracy behind the meeting in JNU. The Delhi Police chief didn't help matters by loosely tweeting about "blasphemy" - another dynamite word that only added to the turmoil that "sedition" had already caused.2. The participants at the February 9 JNU rally: There are two categories here - the organisers of the original meeting, and Kanhaiya Kumar, President of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union. The original meeting was illegal, having been denied permission. Participants at the meeting chanted slogans against India and called for its breaking up. This amounted to objectionable and hate speech against the country, and against a broader community of Indians.
Kumar, by sympathetic accounts, arrived after these slogans had been heard. His supporters say he did not participate in that part of the meeting. However, his 20-odd minute speech, available on YouTube and accessible to anybody who knows Hindi, was vituperative even by conventional standards of student politics. At the very least, it accused the government (or the perhaps the political party heading the government) of gunning down citizens, gunning down Muslims and doing worse.
Did either of the two sets of words - the pre-Kumar slogans and Kumar's own speech - amount to sedition? The first set probably did, though one wouldn't recommend the sedition law even in that case. Was Kanhaiya Kumar in breach of the law? Well, by "wilfully joining an illegal assembly", he was technically in breach of the law, but that was admittedly a technicality.
More crucially, did these two sets of words - the pre-Kumar slogans and Kumar's own speech - cross a certain line in terms of decorum, decency and abuse of public amity, discourse and space? It is apparent they did. To pretend these are samples of "contrarianism" or part of the "multiple narratives of nationalism" is poppycock.
Is a statement such as the "country is made up of Ramzaade and haraamzade" an example of "multiple narratives of nationalism"? Is the suggestion that the Congress would not have made Sonia Gandhi party president if she had been African and black, rather than European and white, a rendition of "contrarianism", or is it simply a remark in disgustingly bad taste? Either all of the four examples given in the preceding paragraphs are fine in an astoundingly permissive society - or all merit rejection. One cannot pick and choose.3. The JNU community: This is an inaccurate and catch-all phrase for a spectrum of groups and individuals with varying motives. There are the student body, the administrative staff association, the teachers' association, and presumably others. Are the others - the silent ones - in a minority or a majority? We don't know - and frankly, it doesn't matter. It needs to be understood though that while this episode and the manner in which communication technology has carried it far and wide has hurt perceptions of the government, it has not left JNU unscathed either.
Prospective students and their parents who may have watched videos of the February 9 meeting and of Kanhaiya Kumar will ask questions about the level of discourse and broader campus culture at the University. Second thoughts will arise. This would perhaps be unfair in making a mountain of a molehill. It may be part of a larger "crisis in Indian higher education" (a phrase this writer has been hearing for the past 40 years and a condition that successive governments, including the current one, have done little to remedy), but it can leave an immediate impact on JNU's reputation.
That is why this episode needs to be handled with sensitivity and calm, particularly by those who have the greatest stake in this leading university's future.4. Political parties: The majority is not always right, and the majority may not always be in conformity with an individual's values, ethics and sense of right and wrong. Even so, the majority is a defining parameter in electoral politics and is the factor that drives political parties. It is a fair bet that the broader populace, outside the hot-house atmosphere of Lutyens' City and of TV-studio Delhi, finds the sort of slogans heard at JNU on February 9 to be abhorrent. In that sense, the government - despite its overreach - could be in smaller trouble than its political opponents believe.
When it comes to specific political parties, from the BJP to the CPI(M) to the CPI, from the Aam Aadmi Party to Kashmiri activists to the Maoists, they are all addressing identified constituencies. Even a screaming prime-time news anchor (who is of course not a political party) is addressing his constituency. The only one confused is Rahul Gandhi. His short and dramatic appearance at JNU had him in the midst of a crowd that is extremely unlikely to vote for the Congress. Indeed, the impulsive decision to go to the University and speak in that manner has left more than one senior Congress politician wondering if a middle-of-the-road position may not have been better.5. The media: The attack on reporters by lawyers (some of who may well have had BJP connections) at the Patiala House Courts was unpardonable. The court premises are turbulent at the best of times, but this event took things too far. The police needs to redeem itself by arresting the guilty.
Quite separately, have well-known sections of the media covered the JNU affair appropriately? Coverage - a word that encompasses reportage, assessment, analysis and opinion - has sometimes been tendentious and catering to the "with us or against us" sentiment that the media so often accuses politicians of promoting.
This is not about political positions, it is about the greyness that makes up the craft of journalism and can be practised irrespective of voting preferences. Here the coverage of a Telegraph or of a Times Now has been equally un-nuanced. Both are painting a picture of an India in the midst of a massive conflict - but two qualitatively different conflicts. In reality, neither conflict exists.
It has become an epidemic. On social media, senior media-persons routinely critique and attack each other. They then quote each other's tweets and write up a story, pretending this echo chamber represents a "national debate". It does nothing of the sort; it only exaggerates the currents prevalent in a small geography in central Delhi.
Outside that small geography, the rest of India - one billion people and then some - carries on as usual.(The author is senior fellow, Observer Research Foundation.

                            Some semblance of logic - well done! At the end of the day, all the constituents - politicians, media people, journalists, students etc. are driven by their own greed and agendas. Everyone is playing it up and no one (NOT ANY MEDIA HOUSE INCLUDING NDTV) has any concern beyond their immediate gain. Politicians are playing up their vote banks and hence the hardened stand of BJP and its opponents and journalists (actually journalists is a wrong word for these guys - pseudo politicians may be the correct word!) and busy pandering to their masters voice on the right, left or center. It seems like JNU is the only thing that is happening in India while no one even talks about it in real life <br/><br/>
Its only for the "Aam Aadmi" (not to be confused for the supporters of AAP) to judge this and move ahead and get on in their task of building their lives and the country while all the jokers (politicians, journalists, intellectuals etc.) create impediments in this. <br/>
Am sure this too will pass!

                            Really shocking trend in India and much more shocking from Congress party &amp; Rahul Gandhi, who had been in power during the life sentence execution for Afzal Guru which is fought by UPA Central Govt. in Supreme Court, Asked to Hon. President to deny mercy plea of Afzal Guru and same UPA is now supporting Pro-Afzal slogans &amp; Anti-India movements by so called JNU students (which are not real students at all) Real students are not interested other than their study &amp; career. These students career in selected political parties are secured and thats why behaving like vultures of JNU. Jai Hind.

                            JNU SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN TO KEEP INDIA FREE FROM MAOIST, LEFTIST, SEPERATISTS ELEMENTS IN THE GUISE OF STUDENTS. SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT LIKE IT BUT THE FACT IS THAT FOR A LONG TIME JNU HAS BEEN USED BY THESE ELEMENTS TO RUND DOWN THE SOVERIGNITY OF THE COUNTRY AND TO UNDERMINE THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA. THE PREVIOUS UPA GOVT WAS HAND IN GLOVE WITH SUCH ELEMENTS AS EVIDENT FROM THE STATEMENTS AND SUPPORT TO SUCH ELEMENTS BY NON OTHER THAN VP OF CONGRESS PARTY MR RG. THERE MAY BE MANY UNIVERSITIES ELSEWHERE IN INDIA ALSO . THEY MUST ALSO BE IDENTIFIED AND CORRECTIVE MEASURES TAKEN. NO PERSON OR GROUP CAN BE ALLOWED TO PLAY WITH THE SECURITY OF THE COUNTRY IN THE NAME OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. GOVT. MUST STERNLY TAKE CONTOL OF THE SITUATION AND SEND A STRONG MESSAGE THAT SUCH ACTS WILL NT BE TOLERATED.

                            It is the left parties and Congress who precipitated the issue , by totally supporting the anti - national slogans. Mr. Kumar should have organised a separate rally, different from the one is which is illegal and unauthorized. He might have made a passionate speech, but nave condemned the the anti national slogans. He is  guilty by his silence.

                            For once I find myself agreeing with 95% of what Malik is saying/writing. I would only differ, when he says Kanhaiya's speech was vituperative. I don't think it was. He was just reflecting the anger that is mounting against this govt, for its own faults and for the neglect that rural India has been facing for the last 6 decades. He was delivering a political speech of course. But a student leader with a left affiliation is permitted to do that. What is wrong in that? How will you sugar coat resentment that is boiling in rural parts of the country? People are starving. Crops are failing. Prices are rising. And nothing seems to have improved despite a change in govt. I don't belong to any political party. I just cant figure why cant we act like people who can argue and counter-argue without having to invoke Bharat Mata or calling the other a sanghi? Internet is, despite all its transformative benefits, is also creating a society that his forgetting to argue constructively. Honestly, my friends I know did not vote BJP to power to see this. We want a country that is liberal, equal and equally accessible to all. But if we turn into a bunch of angry, mad and eccentric people, we will end up electing angry, mad, eccentric people. It will lead us all to doom. So everyone take a fresh breath, get that young boy out of jail and make room for arguments and counter arguments. Like responsible adults.

                            Though I read Mr. Malik's opinion mostly, the title of blog, discouraged me to read. Nonetheless I read and it turned out to be balanced as usual. Very objectively he states everyone is playing to their constituency. Everyone is interested in blowing up the issue. And it suits everyone. Media has Block-buster topic, as they believe. Opposition believes they continue to strike gold with Hydrabad and now JNU. BJP thinks to capitalize on nationalism. And Mr. Malik rightly  point out about tiny geographic circle of influencing people thinking (as usual) high about themselves. Mango people in City understands everything, and Mango people in rural area doesn't bother to watch news channel.

                            Very good analysis by Mr. Ashok Malik. But, unfortunately, the role of NDTV was not impartial. They should be more judicious in reporting news and should not allow fanning of such act to promote anarchism. <br/>
JNU students are the most privileged class to continue their studies at least possible cost through subsidy from government which is paid by common people of India. They are shouting against our mother land. Freedom of Speech does not give anyone liberty to defame our mother land. Truly educated persons are aware of their limitations and shall never give anti-national slogans; other cynic persons may do so as they are crazy to be at the center of attraction of media through "Breaking News" and pseudo secular Politicians. It is known to us that the crooked politicians always try to fetch some political gain (vote bank politics) during such impasse that may happen in any part of the country. If such anti-national slogans happened to be shouted in Pakistan, could you imagine what punishment is expected..... <br/>
If someone at JNU has given anti-national slogan, then let the law takes its own course.....<br/>
Those who shout anti-national slogans in the campus are black sheep; they should be driven out from the university.....<br/>
Politicians should be more judicious in their approach to solve the issue, should guide the students to the right track and should not allow fanning of this sort of anti-national activities (shouting slogan like - "divide the country into pieces…..") to promote anarchism…..<br/>
Media should be more tolerant and wise in spreading "Breaking News" on 24x7 basis and should not add fuel to the fire; should try to douse it at their best. Media should always come out with specific positive solution and message of unity to the students to restore peace and harmony in the campus…

JNU students were getting fatter and lawless as they have no cost and we poor tax payers feed them ... even the selection process is to be checked how only leftists and maoists get enrolled with the active support of so called intellectuals leftist teaching fraternity ... Finally finally students are coming there only for getting enlightened not to get pampered with a high dose of subsidy , intellectual corruption and chance for womanising with young girls in the name of co education ,,,, ultimately there is a different orientation for the students and the teachers and the polticians like pappu who get muddled there

                            I listened to Kanhaiya's speech, how was it vituperative, it is something a very good number of people and majority under privileged feel and think, it was a political stand point and something which is extremely relevant today with Rohith's case so fresh in the minds and the whole Public bank loan default scam unveiling and the stubborn refusal of the state and banks to pardon off measly loans of the farmers. Ashok that is what is vituperative, the failure to recognize all life to be equal.

                            Malik ji - could you kindly brief us under whose rule Afzal Guru the sentence was given and executed and under whose rule the eruption shows out.  Last but not the least do not you see with your grey and fallen hair whether any conspiracy was hatched by some elements of fringe groups to belittle the existing government.  If you being free thinker, you could have advised what need to be done rather than this way

                            Good assessment! But still the attitude of anti Indians and the support given for such a position by political parties and a section of the media needs to be taken much more seriously as it portends ominous things for the country going forward and can not be contained in a soft assessment of how people could have handled the situation.

                            Dear Sir, we've all been students at that stage in our life.  There are always fringe elements.  May be JNU has more of these and also has allowed a 'free for all' that day. And the Press covered it with gay abandon as  usual.  They have lost touch with substantive issues.  And the Government acted tough. No one likes toughness. And a voice of support here or there amounts to 'universal support' as promoted by our media.  Now the Hon Supreme Court is seized of the matter.

                            In any movement, there are elements, who are look out for opportunities to exploit the situation be propagating their own agenda. How anti India, pro Pakistan, pro Afzal etc. etc. crusaders infiltrated the campus indicates failure of intelligence. JNU followed by Jadavpur University are just seeded for a more complex growth of disorientation of the system. Some other Universities may be just waiting to jump in and these 'non' students' will be there.

                            The fundamental problem is the very name of the university.  It is a travesty to name any university after a person whose myth as the benevolent leader of India is now being debunked.  Nehru, the leader in question was an incompetent leader who put himself in a position where he was accountable to nobody.  Thus it was that he was able to dismiss an elected government in Kerala, he was able to take the Kashmir issue to the UN without anybody's agreement, he was able to send thousands of unarmed soldiers to certain death in the ill-advised war, started by him, against China, he got clean away with the Mundra and jeep scandals, and, most dreadful of all, he imposed on India the dreadful dynastic rule!  A direct consequence of the imposition of dynastic rule was the visit to the mis-named university by the universally derided Rahul Gandhi for no better a reason than to make trouble.  Ironic that Nehru was himself not the popular leader that the myth-makers have made him out to be; Patel was the preferred leader but regrettably, in another ill-advised act, Gandhi imposed Nehru on the nation.  With all this in mind, true patriots who are proud of India and being Indian would in this day and age be quite right in asserting themselves and not stand back when witnessing the advocacy of the destruction of India by such devious characters as Kanhaiya Kumar with the indulgence of journalists who also sneak into enemy territory, flitting from studio to studio and effectively collaborate with India's enemies.

Ashok completely and perhaps conveniently ignore the most important stakeholder of all the tax payer and his money<br/><br/>

from time to time students here must be reminded that they are accountable to the tax payer... including their own parents<br/><br/>
as far as use of term "epidemic" is concerend then these days headline grabbers are running an industry ... one that has no ethics and respect ... these are just "intolerant" lot

Nafrat ki aanch mein khud ko dhundta hai <br/>
Iska zameer kahan kho gaya yaaro<br/>
Tere bhgwa ki roshni mere azaan ki guftgu <br/>
Phir yahan sannata aur andhera kaun bo gaya yaaro<br/>
Who avvaze aati hai diwaro ke us paar se , kuch teri hai kuch meri<br/>
Jis zameen ko hum dono apna maane who kuch meri hai kuch teri<br/>
Jab waqt hai bachho ki bilakhne ki awaaz sun ne ka, tum apna dhyan kahan laga gaye  yaaro<br/>
Masla zindagi ka hai isse fizool hi dhuen mei ura gaya yaaro<br/>
Tujhse mera raafta na sahi , tujhse mera raasta na sahi<br/>
 Magar Teri cheekho mein kahi khud paa gaya yaaro<br/>
Is shahar ko kya ho gaya yaro<br/>
Ye kya manjar hai , tere mere dono ke haatho mein khanjar hai<br/>
Shheshe ki is imaarat ko kab tak sambhalega tu , pure zamaane ke haatho mein pathar hai<br/>
Jis awaaz ne hume jorna tha us awaz ne hume  zuda kiya<br/>
Is saher ko is zehar ki nazar kaun  kar gaya yaaro

Instead, he blames Government,due to his allegiance to some parties.
