Headline::::What Rahul Wants from Sonia Gandhi



DateTime::::2015-02-28T18:39:00+05:30



(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer. She is working on a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi which will be published later this year.)
	Former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit who kept the Congress in power for three terms in the capital came out strongly against Ajay Maken this month. In a public statement, Ms Dikshit said, "I pity him... that's all I can say... Maken was the campaign head, it should have been aggressive, he should have conveyed the work done by party. He lost focus and never took us along."
	She added, "Those remarks (Maken's personal comments against Ms Dikshit which included allegations of misgovernance) came back to hurt him... and not just him, they hurt the party too... Every family or party goes through a generational shift... it's normal... but were those remarks needed before an election?"
	Maken, a known adversary of veteran leader Sheila Dikshit and the face of the Congress in the Delhi elections lashed out at her in every possible election rally, even while asking for  votes for the work the Congress had done for Delhi . While Rahul Gandhi addressed some rallies, Sheila Dikshit was not invited, and sought intervention from Sonia Gandhi. A senior leader could not be insulted publicly and isolated like this from the party, she conveyed. Mrs Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi remained mute spectators.
	The Dikshit- Maken spat may have become flagrantly public but there is nothing to suggest that the party's infamous "HighCommand" was not aware of the internal rumblings of dissatisfied party workers. The same High Command was locked into arrogant inaction when informed by party members of theemergence of Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as a force to reckon with, or regional outfits like the MIM eating intoits vote-share in Maharashtra.
	The Congress seems to be living in an iron dome where no voice enters, only rare Gandhi utterances exit.  It is a party which failed to crack the whip on high-profile wheeler dealers who exchanged the clout of the Congress when it was in power for personal benefits, and despite this stayed close to 10 Janpath, the residence of Sonia Gandhi and the nerve-centre of her party.
	In the last one week, much has been made about Rahul Gandhi's sabbatical.  Those close to him call it an ultimatum by the junior Gandhi to his mother who refused to see the 'treachery' by those close to her. Others simply scoff at the entire episode - "Let him take a break for good. Save us the constant torture"
	Amidst all this is the lone Congress worker who, debacle after debacle, holds up placards at the party's headquarters, asking for Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to rescue the party for the political wasteland that critics say it has turned into.
	But apart from him and his faith in Priyanka, where does the Congress head from here, what ails it, what can help it? There are many questions, no answers, as a deafening silence echoes in the Gandhi household.
	 Vice President Rahul Gandhi attempted a "Do you hear me?" moment in 2013 when, in a scene straight out of a film script, he tore the controversial ordinance that was to negate the Supreme Court verdict on convicted lawmakers. Terming it as "complete nonsense", he said, "What our government has done is wrong." This was the classic rebellion by the prodigal against the two power centres in the party -his mother and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who was then on a foreign visit.
	As opposed to the public version, it is believed that Dr Manmohan Singh stood with Rahul Gandhi in this move which was aimed at encircling  Mrs Gandhi's political advisors. Ahmed Patel and ilk were the common enemy, the same enemy which has allegedly driven Rahul into his current political abstinence (which ends of March 10, the party has hastily assured).
	A senior Congress leader who claims to be close to the junior Gandhi commented "Rahul could not work with these dalals (middlemen) who surround her mother. They have misled her and sullied the image of the party in the public. She believes that these leaders have displayed political acumen in the past. He had to leave. Now it's up to her to cleanse the party of its dalals and sins".
	The thought finds many takers within the party, especially amongst Rahul's young MP friends who believe that the elders in the party have hijacked the strengthening of regional leadership. Recently, Digvijaya Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia, known rivals whose bitter history of a tug-of-war for leadership in Madhya Pradesh does not need an introduction, came together on the same platform to launch a scathing attack on the Shivraj Singhgovernment in the Vyapam scam.
	Both Singh and Scindia addressed a joint rally seeking accountability of the ruling party in Madhya Pradesh. In almost a year, this was the first time an aggressive Congress Party was taking on an issue making its way to news debates. But like most issues, there was absolute silence from the Congress' top two leaders; a similar silence was maintained when many attacked the Modi government for allowing religious intolerance. Rahul Gandhi, sources said, who had accused the BJP of using communalism for electoral profit, wanted senior party leaders to launch a sustained campaign against the government for allegedly inflaming religious tension.
	Coming soon - too soon for a party in such shambles - are crucial polls in Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and lethargy grips 10 Janpath when leaders approach with possible power points and gameplan. They are told that a national party cannot compromise on its stature.
	"In the absence of the Left, the Congress could have galvanized support for itself by replenishing its political strategy, by hearing the voices from the ground, by focusing its energy in the states, but there seems to be an unwillingness to listen. It feels claustrophobic to be a Congress worker in these times," said a youth Congress leader.
	Some in the party believe that it's not too late for the party to spring a surprise, to remove the power brokers, and push reforms and a clean management within the party.
	Can Sonia Gandhi hear the Congress?  Not everyone can register their protest by taking some time off.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Rahul will be back to push  Khan-gross further behind.<br/>
That will be the Shezhada's greatest service to India and it's long suffering citizens.India needs a break from Rahul and his ilk.<br/>
Indians have endured  the tyranny of Rahul's arrogant and brutal  ancestors and their remotely controlled spineless servants like Maunmohan Singh; who  notoriously  allowed the  plunder of India's treasury by his wilful oversight and neglect by turning a blind eye to the evils committed by his ministers.<br/>
India's only hope is to reject forever the communal anti Hindu and pro Muslim divisive poison that this evil party  peddled  by devils like Aiyer,Jha,Diggy,Anthony,Chidambaram and their ring leaders mafioso Sonia and Rahul.<br/>
We Indians Hindus and Muslims alike must save India and Indians from this pit of snakes.

                            Rana has wasted her time in analysis.  As Nikhilesh Joshi correctly points out, nobody is interested.  Gone are the days when we Indians were subservient.  An aspirational India means that people cannot simple inherit power as a 'birth right'.  The have to earn it.  In the old days, when there was a mystique about the Gandhi/Nehru parivar, people were frightened to speak out against the lack of merit in that family.  Now, with modern methods of communication and a new confidence, people will not kowtow to anybody merely because of their parentage.  India wants, as does the world, people to rise according to the merit they possess.  It should be obvious that neither Rahul nor his Mummy possess any merit worthy of making them leaders of a proud India.  The 'old guard' will not even be worthy of mention in history and will disappear into oblivion.  Without the Gandhi/Nehru family Congress is nothing and quite rightly so.  Congress reached its sell by date decades ago and was merely existing as an enterprise to enrich the chosen few at the expense of the majority.

                            Miss Rana Ayyub, what have you to say about the atheist blogger Avijit Roy's murder? If you read this comment please for a second look at yourself in the mirror and answer my question! Or will you justify it just like you did in the Charlie Hebdo case? Please have some shame!

                            Rahul has democratized the Youth Congress and the NSUI. Office bearers in these organisations are elected through a democratic process. If he can replicate the same model in the parent organization, the party might be able to make a come back.

                            I would request the author to please go and visit Amethi once and then decide if it is worth wasting so much on "analyzing"  Rahul and his parivar. To me it looks like their ability to get anything accomplished is a big zero. In a way, I envy Rahul .. I wish I could take vacations like him without having to worry about earning my living !

                            pointless article/opinion. Please focus your available skills on something constructive to common man. Journalists should have some moral responsibility, result oriented actions and contribute towards uplift of poor and common man.

                            An argument put forward by the author relating to a short term leave of Rahul Gandhi holds some water.Author says that a senior Congress leader who was close to Rahul has said that Rahul Gandhi could not work with the middlemen who were surrounding her and that they have misled her mother and sullied the image of the Party in the public.

                            Frankly, @RanaAyyub, who the hell cares what happens to Congress party, its President or her prodigal son? They have been having a party too long and suddenly, when its time to become accountable for all the misdeeds, chooses to either remain silent or else run away. India I am sure can afford to take its losses if the Chinese Gandhis actually do run away. Can treat it as good riddance to bad rubbish, move on to better times. Well I guess it is the best possible option for all Indians

                            Miss Rana, Sonia is a veteran leader of congress, she has some personal problem with her son inlaw Dats y she is not giving opprtunity to priyanka and giving importance to Rahul. It is political cum family drama. Same as sanjay rajeev problem, it is not only family problem but a national problem also.
