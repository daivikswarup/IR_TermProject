Headline::::Newsroom: When Nana Patekar Became a Real Life Hero



DateTime::::2015-09-11T19:10:00+05:30



(The Newsroom, a new weekly column by Sonia Singh, NDTV's Editorial Director, focuses on the big news stories, how we covered them and why.)
Does the farmer's crisis need a 'Celebrity Ambassador'? Odd as this may sound, that's the immediate thought that struck me when I noticed the feedback pouring in for our correspondent Tejas Mehta's interview this week of actor Nana Patekar in Latur in drought-hit Marathwada.
Our team, including Uma Sudhir, Maya Sharma and Tejas, have been travelling to different drought-hit areas of Maharashtra, Telangana and North Karnataka in the last two months; theirÂ  reports have ranged from tracking young children as they walked miles for water to a village of farmers' widows to the suicide of a woman farmer who left behind five children. Their stories were good, solid journalism, exploring the root causes of chronic water shortage (where are the crores and crores that have been spent in irrigation schemes over the years?), why state and centre politics have meant that not one of these areas has an official 'drought' yet; at the same time, the stories powerfully narrated the stories of those living...and dying ...through consecutive years of crop failure and indebtedness.
Â 
Actor Nana Patekar personally went to the seats of farmer widows and handed over cheques of Rs. 15,000 in a small hall in Latur, Marathwada.
Editorially, I was glad NDTV was dedicating time and resources to these stories, but retaining viewer connect in urban India's households for a non 'breaking' story over a period of time was, to put it mildly, extremely challenging.
Nana Patekar changed that.
Tejas ran into Mr Patekar by sheer chance when he reached Latur in Marathwada as part of his journey and was told that the actor was distributing cheques to widows here. There was no well-oiled PR machinery available to inform the media that "access was allowed from this gate at this time and only for 15 minutes". Instead, the actor was in a small hall where the power went off midway. Illuminated only by mobile phone torches, the actor gave cheques of Rs. 15,000 to aroundÂ  100 widows. Incredibly, this wasn't a one-off event; he had been coming here every weekend for the last month. Why was he here and not in Mumbai's film world at a time when his latest movie,' Welcome Back', had just released, Tejas asked him. His reply: "I couldn't sit at home while farmers were dying". He may not be Bollywood's biggest name, but just this short interview by a star in a real-life setting focused people's attention on Marathwada farmers in a way that a series of news reports across different newspapers and TV channels couldn't - the flip side of being in a celebrity-obsessed society.
Â 
People turned on the torch on their phones so that Nana Patekar could continue to distribute cheques during a power cut that lasted 5 minutes.
It's not that India doesn't care, in fact, quite the opposite. Whenever we do stories on individual farmers and their families or, indeed, anyone in need, there is an outpouring of viewer support. Corporates and individuals write to us, offering financial help; in some cases, lakhs have poured in for a family where a father has killed himself over a sum smaller than Rs. 50,000. However, when the problem is one which needs systemic support over years, where it can't be fixed by writing a cheque, when it's blamed on government apathy, there's a sense of ennui that sets in. How do we make the stories of Marathwada relevant in Mumbai's Pali Hill drawing rooms or even in Chennai and Bengaluru? Not by shifting focus but by dedicated on-the-ground reporting backed by research and well-told stories. Sometimes, with a little help from a Star.Â Footnote: another political 'star' also brought the drought in Telangana into sharp focus last week. The Telangana Chief Minister, who hired a 2-crore private jet for his entourage to travel to China at a time when farmers are killing themselves every day in his state.

                            Nana is one of the most sincere and down-to-earth actors. Not to forget also one of the most talented. I am surprised about him having survived for so long in this artificial, label-conscious industry for so long ! We hardly hear about ANY charity work done by other big names in Bollywood. Maybe they are too humble and publicity shy ??

                            Charity does not solve any problem actually it enhances criminalization because it encourages exploitation to gather more than you deserve. We have three forth water on the earth and still we are crying for it that indicates we lack in planning or common sense. We easily accept science to increase our population, but fail to practice scientific attitude. When our first PM asks to adapt scientific attitude in day to day life, people make fun of him. Now we are busy giving milk to idol and our children are starving to death. Somewhere, we have to think it seriously and stop creating hell on earth to enter in to non-existent haven. We have to start practicing humanity in a scientific way prior to nature start taking its toll on us.

                            This act of Haha Tapekar was orchestrated by the sena and it issued a fatwa to all others to pay up - not to the farmers but to the political thugs of Maha-Rashtra.

                            The unsavory fact is media is focussed on urban middle-class who at best can be termed as a self-serving class caught in a rat race, and whose only respite is entertainment provided at the prime-time with salacious breaking news of idiotic content for their vicarious pleasure. Can one otherwise explain why hours are spent on dissecting the gory details of Indrani-Sheena murder case instead of focussing on farmer crisis across the nation. The fact is as a nation we abhor reality and want to live in a dream world spun by Bollywood. We are all escapists.

                            The author has taken it all wrong. It is the faith that the people have in Nana that has prompted them to support Nana by collecting funds in the upcoming festival. The people who are supporting are not the usual celebrity hungry people. But these are ones who want to help always but are not sure whether the help end up with the deserving people or end up in a hometown of a politician. So please don't call them celebrity hungry. As regards scientific approach suggested by a reader, it is essential in the long run. But immediate help is required to feed the hunger. Our scientific approach is not going to feed them.

                            Nana Patekar is doing it right because he doesn't have political patronage to lose. Other luminaries of our society are worried if they support the cause of poor farmers they may be labelled as socialist, reformist, or even maoist, and become suspect in the eyes of the political masters. Some of them may even be covertly supporting the farmer's cause monetarily or otherwise but most of them have become dehumanised; they are happy as long as they have their salad bowls fresh on the table!

The Maha govt. has promised something but whether they will deliver on ground is questionable looking at the condition of promises made by Central BJP govt.<br/>
To make matter worse elction to Maha assembly is 4 years ahead.

                            Really we must hats off to Mr.Nana Patekar for his human touch and sense in helping widows of farmers who committed suicide due to lack of water and financial assistance. I request all the film actors/actress and other film fraternity please come forward do your best and help the widows of farmers and show your humanity.  It will be very helpful to the widows and farmers.  The act of Mr.Nana Patekar shows still humanity is there to come to the resuce of needy persons in general and particularly farmers of Maharashtra. Again and again I hats off to Mr.Nana Patekar.

                            Hats off to Mr.Nana Patekar.  He has got good human touch and sense and able to understand the sorrow and sadness of widows of deceased farmers.  From entire film fraternity atleast one human being came out with good gestures.  I request all the film actors and actresses come to the rescue of widows of farmers who are dying without water and food. If one actor/actress come out and help the needy farmers really it is good help for the humanity in general and particularly farmers of Maharasthra.
