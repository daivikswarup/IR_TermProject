Headline::::On Asking Kejriwal To Mind His Own Business



DateTime::::2015-10-21T20:59:00+05:30




                                People like Delhi Police Commissioner, BS Bassi and Romesh Bhandari belong to the same clan. The Facebook and WhatsApp generation may not know Romesh Bhandari, but for my generation, he was a Foreign Secretary who went on to become the Governor of UP. He was a fine mind with a crooked brain. He was so hungry for power that he had no regard for the constitution and democratic traditions. He was willing to dance to the tunes of his masters in Delhi to further his career. He sacked a duly-elected majority government of Kalyan Singh in the late 90s on flimsy grounds; finally, the Supreme Court had to intervene and Kalyan Singh was reinstated as Chief Minister.
There are numerous such cases in Indian political history where people holding constitutional posts and high offices had no respect for constitution while serving their political masters. In the era of social media revolution and live television coverage, it's difficult to emulate Romesh Bhandari but other methods have been invented by power-hungry bureaucrats and careerists. Since Modi's time as Chief Minister in Gujarat, such examples abound. The same model is being applied at the Centre. The Delhi elections turned the table completely. AAP thought that it would be smooth sailing and they would not have to worry about running the government because of its massive majority, but the last eight months have proved to be anything but smooth.
Najeeb Jung, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi and BS Bassi as Police Commissioner have made every effort to stall the government. The Delhi police chief has been making all kinds of statements against the duly elected Chief Minister of Delhi. I have known many Police Commissioners in Delhi, and many of them were very tough and upright, but none of them would behave the way the incumbent Police Commissioner is behaving. This week, he said that "The Chief Minister should worry more about corruption in his cabinet than talking about corruption in the police department." The context was a recent survey which reports that corruption in Delhi government has declined, but the Delhi police is the most corrupt department. Perhaps he should have felt alarmed about this, but he was busy giving interviews to TV channels in his new neta-style Modi jacket.
As Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal has every right to feel outraged with the brutal rape of two young girls, one aged two and the other aged five. He was moved, as any citizen should be, and asked the Prime Minister to discipline the Delhi police force, or give him charge of the Delhi Police for a year and then evaluate the results. Mr Police Commissioner has no reason to jump into this. I can tell you from my experience that bureaucrats don't jump into political slugfests. They prefer to do their jobs. The present police chief has forgotten protocol. In fact, in one of his interviews, he went to the extent of suggesting that the police force should not be put under political leadership. Is it not an insult to the spirit of the constitution which runs on the basic premise of the will of the people? How can a serving Police Commissioner make a public statement disrespecting a democratically elected Chief Minister? If he had any issues, he should have made a complaint to the Home Minister or the Prime Minister. He forgot that bureaucrats are taught and intended to serve political leadership irrespective of the color of their ideology and strictly follow service rules.
Law and Order as a subject is not with the Delhi government, but in the event of any lawlessness, it is the government that has to answer. Sheila Dikshit suffered for the same in the past. AAP has been asking the Delhi Police to be more accountable and more professional. Delhi in the last few years has become a rape capital and most insecure for women. The AAP government has promised to install CCTV cameras across the city, light up dark spots and put marshals in buses. Six months ago, the AAP government requested the Delhi Police to provide information in this regard (improved safety measures) without any success. The Delhi Police instead turnedÂ  it into a turf war. Even the Lieutenant Governor did not release the list of 6,000 home guards who were assigned VVIP duty, so that they could be placed on marshal duty to protect the public. Later, he relented.
For women's safety, the process of installing CCTVs has begun and a pilot project of marshals deployment in 200 buses has also been initiated by the AAP government. But the Delhi Police has not taken any measure. It has vacancies for 16,000 and has failed to install CCTVs despite a Delhi High Court order just days ago that warned the Modi government of the need for urgency, stating "If you don't do anything now, you are forcing us to launch contempt of court proceedings."
This is a direct indictment of the Modi government. To fill the 16,000 vacancies and install CCTVs, the Delhi Police needs nearly 900 crores. The Central Home Ministry has been told by the Finance Ministry that it has no money. Imagine, the same government that has spent thousands of crores on advertisements for the Clean India campaign, Yoga Day and the Digital India campaign does not want to allocate money for women safety for Delhi. The High Court commented, "For us the safety of common man is important. We don't believe in scolding officers, but you have to think it is a very serious matter that for the sake of money, you are not ready to recruit police personnel."
The Police Commissioner took umbrage when Kejriwal said that there is "jungle raj" in Delhi and law and order has "collapsed". But what about the Delhi High Court which said, "We can take judicial note that the law and order situation in the national capital is pretty abysmal." Please note that the court has used "abysmal" - a harsh word. May I ask if the Delhi Police Commissioner will also ask the Delhi High Court to mind its own business?
Let's not forget he is the same man who refused to take action against policemen in the custody death of Shahnawaz Chaudhary last month in broad daylight. The High Court has ordered a special investigation into this. It's people like Bassi who weaken our democratic set up and that is a matter of serious worry.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

U knew that Delhi police is not under Delhi Govt, then why u made all those false promises? And why u guys always confront Modi? He has other works to do man, not like u writing articles and crying in front of tv cameras.

                            so.... are you saying that it is OK for Kejriwal to make corruption statements against Bassi, but not the other way round?<br/><br/>
I understand that Kejriwal does not like opposing views within the party, but if he thinks he can make such scoot-and-run statements and not expect reciprocal behavior, I have a bridge to sell him!

                            The Ashutosh, AK has failed miserably in the governance of Delhi and is now looking for excuses for his non-performance. The rate at which AAP government's cabinet members are getting caught in corruption and criminal scandals is worse then even the UPA government. AK is dictatorial in his working style and it is the good fortune of Delhi that it is not a full state or else the havoc he could have wrought on Delhi could have been very high.

                            The problem with the AAP party attitude is that all their problems appear to be because of someone else. One gets the feeling the only reason Modi came to power was so he could torment Kejriwal and stop him from doing his duty. If the government feels so handicapped and clearly unable to fulfill its constitutional duties, it should just step aside. The constant complaining is starting to sound like an excuse for ineptitude.

                            Well , there are always two sides &amp; one only gets an objective view if both sides are viewed.<br/>
Fact remains that the 'Chief Minister' of Delhi on the basis of constitution of India is not like Chief Minister of a State(province) but only a Chief Minister in designation.And the incumbent need to learn to operate within the constraints. Added to this Delhi ,being the national capital &amp; home to the Central (federal) Government will have numerous special needs beyond the need of maintaining law &amp; order in the city  - so the police powers  are  better vested  with the Central Government .<br/>
ANd then comes the 3rd factor - the incumbent 'Chief Minister' of the city state was till the other day a middle ranking mandarin in the revenue services - where the LG was a member of the IAS and much senior to him in seniority as also the CP - who is also senior to him in service &amp; hierarchy(assuming that  the incumbent CM continuing in service. These are some of the tikilsh factors to be taken note of journo Ashutosh jee

                            Ashutosh - Before asking other questions, you need to answer why all the tainted ministers/ MLAs (Bharti, Tomar etc) were not sacked instead they had to resign because of public and media pressure. Also, why do these people still hold membership of AAP. Since you are so called champions of honesty why are you not sacking them from AAP or is it because you are the kingpin you need to indirectly support corrupt and crime.  It is quite contradictory while Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra who were truly honest were sacked from party in no time while corrupt and tainted people remain in AAP because of you/ Arvind / Sanjay providing shelter and refuge to them.

                            Dear Ashutosh,<br/>
The thought process as reflected in your articles has by now consolidated itself as the fundamental premise of Mr. Kejriwal/AAP's philosophy. It is marked by the entrenched belief that only AAP knows what is right solution for every problem; a correct approach for every situation; only AAP can determine who is honest and competent; only AAP has perfect solutions whether it is for Delhi, Bihar, Punjab or any other place in the country; only AAP can put forward the optimum economic policies and priorities for the whole country, let alone for Delhi. In short AAP or just a handful of people in the party have more combined intelligence and moral standing than the whole country put together. Interestingly this is despite the fact that nearly everyone in AAP has little administrative, political, legal or moral standing and/or demonstrated record of anything. Yet they can pronounce anyone and everyone guilty, corrupt and or incompetent. It is time that the AAP team focussed on doing what they were elected to do: govern Delhi without forever blaming and finding faults with others. Hobnobbing with scams tainted people in Bihar and throwing out the few competent people that the party had betrays its perpetual double-speak.<br/>

                            Ashutosh, If AK and AAP keep on blaming police for everything and call names like Tullu - does it hold to the dignity of CM ? Please tell that. Police commissioner said please take care of your minister's corruption and I will take care of corruption in police. He didn't use any bad words. AAP just because it won one election want all officers to be your slaves or what ?? Sometimes special condition like AAP's loose talk deserves special treatment. Don't try to threaten police just because you have your CM - OK ??<br/><br/>
You are asking about central advertisement spend - no one can break your AAP and AK record for spending 500 crores within three months of coming to power and without doing anything. Why did you waste the money ? I don't want to condone central expenses, but want to ask you also about your advertisement spend.<br/><br/>
Fact is that, no one can ensure crime free Delhi even if AAP government controls police. Assume that police will be put under AAP and such incidents repeat, are you willing to resign the government ? First show your capabilities in what you control and then ask for more. <br/><br/>
You are telling Bhandari  fine mind with a crooked brain who used to dance to the tunes of his masters. I see that you are doing the same thing here. Just dancing to please AK to be on government payroll ? Did you question him when Bhooshan and Yogendra Yadav were ousted ? No. So you don't have any moral authority to write about others including Bhandari.

                            So law and order is not under Mr. Kejtiwal, so your govt is not responsible... We accept... But who is  Incharge of law and order of UP ...? Then why your master went to see and blame Modi and central government and RSS ... Good I know you don't have brain to think like this...

                            Police must be freed from political control. In no civilised country police functions under political control. Political control is not the solution, but the problem. Read the recommendations of the National Police Commission. Read the order of the apex court in the Prakash Singh case. Both the central and state governments should step back and give autonomy to the police. Expected Kejriwal to demand reform rather than political control. Disappointed.

                            Ashutosh touched CCTV promise but didn't elaborate how many are actually getting installed or already installed. As Govt, you have increased VAT on Fuel in Delhi and need to provide how much money inflow has happened. What I see is once activists, has become full fledged politicians. If AAP has to stay relevant in Delhi, please go back to ground and work. People expect same from you as they mandated 95% seats for you. Don't screw up People's hope.

                            The situation that a chief minister has to rule without a strong police  force under his command   is akin to a driving  a car without steering wheel. Mr.Kejriwal is fully justified in his demand for the Delhi Police to be brought under state's control

                            Ashutosh and Gul Panag,  One thought that AAP consisted of educated people and would have a sense of decency and maturity.  Very let down. Whether the Delhi Police is under you or not, casting aspersions or a person who has served over 30 years of his life in the service is hitting way below the belt.  Do you think by constantly belittling the police chief and the men in uniform, you would be able to direct them to work as per your requirements if they were too move under you.  You have completely vitiated the atmosphere and created distrust not only in the minds of the public but even the men in uniform.  No one ever gets an ideal situation to bat. You play what is served to you. Stop crying 'Mommy' and take responsibility.

The interpretation of the constitution that bureaucracy is subservient to political class is an intellectually corrupt statement. Also coming from Aap which has been elected on the plank of ending vip racism, smells of rot in the already losing intellect stamina of the party.<br/>

Why don't they focus on their work.

                            To all the Modi Bhakts: Kejriwal has disappointed on many fronts, but one thing he has done is to sack his corrupt ministers. Why hasn't 56 inches sacked any of his corrupt ministers? I think Kejriwal should be given a free hand over the Delhi Police for a year. Modi is afraid to do that, as there is a very real possibility that the honest Kejriwal may really reduce corruption in the police and improve law and order in Delhi - where will Mr Development go then?

                            Law enforcement is one of the way to prevent crime against women, but do we really thing this is the only measure to be taken and if Delhi Police comes under AAP suddenly everything would be resolved.Or by installing CCTV, deploying marshals in the bus would stop rape.Are these the only steps or more needs to be done.Rapist do get caught but do they get punished that too swiftly. And who these rapist and why do they do this. Most of the rapes happens by people known to the female, can you really catch them with CCTV, marshals and police. Are these measures enough.is what we Indians are so use to  and just flock behind it.<br/><br/>
Ashutosh you are a learned man and you are trying to serve your political interest over such a sensitive matter. Grow up to the cause , do something substantial and take some responsibility.<br/>
Stop pointing fingers and do something within your realms which seems impact on grouns<br/>
Isn't this very thought foolish <br/>
AAP can do politics on every matter <br/><br/>

                            AAP should not have chosen Delhi as it's best. A full state was needed at the bare minimum. Nothing comes for free, just because they won kingsize does not mean BJP won't try to crush them by all means and in this case they have the most effective weapon at their behest. Power without police department is oxymoron, AAP is deemed to be extinct unless they can re-base out of Delhi. But that may happen in AK's next birth by the pulse of things.

                            Interesting that Ashutosh now commiserates with Sheila Dikshit when Kejriwal and the AAP were the most vocal in blaming her personally for Delhi's law and order issues. Despite her protestations that the Police were not under the Delhi government's control. Now the shoe is on the other foot, and all the AAP govt has been doing us blaming the LG, Delhi Police and Union Govt and shirking responsibility. <br/><br/>
Ashutosh suggests money for Digital India/Clean India could have been diverted fir CCTVs in Delhi. Instead of complaining, perhaps the AAP Govt in Delhi could have transferred done if the hundreds of crores of rupees spent on Kejriwal and AAP Govt advertisements towards CCTVs to keep Delhi citizens safe!! That would have been win-win for both the AAP Govt and Delhi's public. But instead the AAP know only to agitate and complain, rather than administer.

                            Entire problem for Delhi created by BJP Government in Central.  It is a sinister design with evil objective to destablise the AAP Government in Delhi.  Every action of constituionally elected government is being challenged through the office of either LG or Commissioner of police.  It is an alarm for the democracy - not good at all for the citizen of the country.
