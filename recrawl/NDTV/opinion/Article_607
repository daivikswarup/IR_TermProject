Headline::::Thank You, Nitish



DateTime::::2015-11-11T01:28:00+05:30




                                There are firecrackers bursting all over India. And it's not for Diwali. It's in celebration of the drubbing Modi's BJP received in Bihar. The hijacking of the Idea of India has been stopped in mid-heist. We are saved. Thank you, Nitish.
For what has happened in Bihar is not just an election but the Rediscovery of India in the nick of time, on the very eve of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's 125th birth anniversary celebrations. When the forces of malevolence won the Lok Sabha elections last year, too many Indians voted for Modi thinking they would thus end corruption in governance and accelerate the processes of growth. It was called Modi's "development agenda".
But as the year progressed and moved towards the end of 2015, the hidden agenda came all too sharply into focus. Modi's finger that trembles all the time on his Twitter account held firmly back as the real representatives of his thought processes - the Mahesh Sharmas and the Sanjiv Balyans, veteran colleagues in the Sangh Pracharak brigade and ministers to boot - proclaimed aloud with no restraint the steps they were taking to convert our liberal India into an authoritarian Hindu Rashtra, based on a narrow construct of our nationhood and designed not to take us forward through the 21st century but all the way back to the 12th.
There thus followed, in planned succession, the outrageous statements within the sacred precincts of Parliament of Acharya Giriraj Kishore and Yogi Adityanath, backed up by the likes of Sadhvi Jyoti and other BJP MPs; "love jihad"; "Ghar Wapasi"; church attacks; partisan appointments to key positions, based purely (or, rather, impurely) on ideological orientation, in the Indian Council of Historical Research and the Film and Television Institute, among others; subversion of the autonomy of our Universities and other centres of higher learning with the ulterior motive of bending them to yield their academic independence to Hindutva perspectives; recasting syllabi and text books to distort history and the minds of young children; threats to Muslims to "go to Pakistan"; a rising tide of intolerance and violence and black paint circumambulating around beef and cow slaughter; the return in protest of awards by literally hundreds of intellectuals, writers, scientists, artists, and film-makers, all airily dismissed by the Finance Minister as "manufactured dissent"; divisive election rhetoric; the baiting of silver screen icon Shah Rukh Khan; the ridiculous talk, from none other than Amit Shah, of fireworks in Pakistan if the "mistake" were made of defeating the BJP; worst of all, murder and mayhem from Saharanpur to Dadri - none of this condemned or punished and, therefore, implicitly endorsed from on high.
The composite India that our freedom fighters fought for (and whose ranks contained no RSS members or Hindu Mahasabha-ites) was, and was seen to be, under attack as never before. The Prime Minister's pregnant silences spoke louder than all his empty bombast. All this was noted in Bihar.  
To hide their true agenda, the BJP at first proceeded cautiously. Hamstrung by a strong Constitution, embedded with Gandhian and Nehruvian values, they lulled fears of a Hitlerian take-over by a meretricious demonstration of their alleged commitment to Parliamentary democracy. So the newly-elected Prime Minister, in the full glare of a huge bank of TV cameras, knelt to kiss the steps of Parliament House as he first entered it. But within the first couple of sessions, he got bored, even frustrated with dilatory parliamentary procedure. So, where Nehru had proclaimed his commitment to Parliamentary democracy not by kissing well-trodden stones but by conscientiously attending Parliament, Modi, brought up on rare and brief sessions of the Gujarat assembly, started ignoring the House and especially the Rajya Sabha where his troops were badly outgunned.
His contempt for Parliament was unleashed upon the nation when, in the aftermath of the 2014 Winter session, "Ordinance Raj" was unleashed upon the country, beginning with his much-discredited Land Acquisition Ordinance. Democracy started sliding towards the doldrums, however many stone flaggings the Prime Minister may have kissed. He had to be taught that this was not the way of democracy. The Opposition decided that enough was enough and showed him that if Parliament was to function, Parliamentary democracy meant respect for the Opposition. But Modi's inherently autocratic ways made it impossible for him to even sway, let alone bend. This did not go unnoticed in Bihar.
While there has been no attempt by Modi's lot to reach out to the Opposition in the months that have elapsed since the Monsoon session, the hammering they have received in Bihar might have taught them, as the well-known British jurist, the late Sir Ivor Jennings, once wrote: "Every election throws up not only a government but also an Opposition." During the fortnight that remains before Parliament reconvenes, we will see whether Modi's cohorts have learned Parliamentary humility or whether they will go on with their self-destructively arrogant ways.
Bihar has also shown the country that "jumla" politics has had its day, that attempts at finding "samajik samikaran" through untrue innuendo does not work. Most importantly, it has shown that trying to create a salience between "Pakistan" and "Muslim" to scissor a communal divide also does not work, for Indians are too wedded to millennia of religious tolerance, indeed, the celebration of our diversity of faiths, for the exclusivist Hindutva line to work. For a brief passing moment in mid-2014, the electorate was taken in by Modi's style and his disguising his Hindutva agenda with tall talk about "development". Now, after 16 months of Modi raj, they read the Sangh Parivaar's communal signals loud and clear, and see the face of Modi's "development" in dal selling at Rs. 200 a kilo. As one cartoonist has accurately put it, "Har Har Modi" is now "Arhar Modi"!
Agriculture, on which 60% of our people primarily depend for their livelihood, is down two years in a row to just 1.1% in Modi's first year and now steeply hurtling towards negativity in his second; that manufacturing is now at 5%, where in the UPA's heyday it was booming at over 14 %; that exports are wallowing at minus 21%, below where they were at this time last year (which was already well below where it had been the previous - UPA II - year); that imports are stagnating, pulling down all-round economic activity; that no advantage is being taken of the fortuitous fall in global oil prices; that the rupee is at its lowest ever; that NPAs are swelling even as bank credit off-take lingers; that the only things rising are prices and unemployment.
While Nitish has shown that State spending and State schemes are the key to economic and social welfare that encompasses the poor, the BJP's promises are hollow because they are looking to Big Business to bail them out. Bihar saw that Modi knows nothing about development and everything about dividing people and society. Therefore, Bihar sent him packing to the pavilion.
Will the BJP draw the right lessons? It can't. For its Hindtuva was an invention of the 1920s. They are not going to celebrate the upcoming centenary of the creation of the RSS by abandoning everything Savarkar and Golwalkar stood for. They understand Hindutva, they understand little else. Therefore the Bihar wind will continue blowing through the land until we sound the Last Post in 2019. In next year's state elections, the BJP will be nowhere in the picture in at least two States: Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. But they will be in Assam. So, a declining Tarun Gogoi has already announced his strategy of replicating Nitish's "Bihar" model by uniting the secular forces in the state to counter a resurgent BJP. Hence, however many ministers Modi might reshuffle, and even if they send Amit Shah to a well-earned rest, the BJP cannot sustain its 2014 sweep so long as the BJP remains the BJP. The seeds of its self-destruction are embedded in its ideological DNA.(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            This is another timely gem from Mani. Modi found it easy to sell fizz.When asked to deliver development, he found it easier to stir up communal issues in the Bihar election. The reason is simple. Economics does not lie and Modi cannot defend his track record for the 18 months(6 months overseas) in power. Hence, 35 election rallies, as if he has no other job. The speeches were so unbecoming of a PM that the earthy Biharis hit for a 6! Already Advani and co are asking for heads to roll. Amit Shah and Modi will soon be back in Gujarat and India will return. Just like Trudeau said" Canada is back', when he trounced the one man band of Harper

                            C'mon Mani say it; there is a Rahul Gandhi wave in the country now, as Bihar has 20+ congress MLA's<br/>
Nitish has won on caste arithmetic and now he has the fodder scam convicted Lalu for guidance (back seat driving). Multiple scam ridden congress will now ask its pound of flesh with its 27 MLA's; where will governance come from?<br/>
Request congress and other opposition parties to oppose the NDA as and when required but not stop the development and other work in national interest.

                            Mani, <br/>
it appears to me that you are a born sycophant. Why are you thanking Nitish? By fully utilising your tiny vote bank,  he has made his fortune. In return what did you get? 27 seats with 6.7% vote? How does that behoove a century old party? What about Rahul Gandhi's dream of building a strong organisational base in the state so that the party can stand on its own? <br/><br/>
Indeed, you are shameless.

But Mr. Ayer you proved again and again that you can only vomit venom against Modi, For you the king should be Pappu and no others. Congress is pretty much finished from majority of the country. without the mahaghatbandhan you would not have won any seats.

You and your opinions used to be irrelevant - now we listen to you only to know what the enemies of India have to say. You keep playing the pseudo secular card as if to say the 30% (according to you) that voted for BJP are fascist, hate mongering people. This sort of sentiment is going to create a deep chasm and mobilize and galvanize those that have a world view different from you and people that think like you.  You are going to be vanquished and Congress and their leaders will be reduced a mere relic in the museum.

                            Maniji.... We all know that after independence nothing great happened to this great nation other than false promises by the political parties. Jo bhi progress hua mostly because of private sector intervention.Much of development we see in cities are due to IT boom. Government is still sleeping after chasing British. Even after 69 years of post independence era, political parties are busy in giving credit to who did what for independence. Busy rewriting the history text book for students. <br/>
The best policy is transparency in the government. Making people aware what the government is doing.  Although we can judge the progress nationwide but we also need data, facts and figures. Tax reforms is must, health sector need more uniformity.  Howeve,r the most important is agriculture. <br/><br/>
Indian economy is a agriculture based economy and none of the political parties did great job to uplift the agriculture sector. Farmers life is stagnant in 12th century. It appears to me that they will never ever see the 21st century.The only good thing happened to them is "Green revolution" but that just wheat improvement. What about other crops, rice, dal, sabzi etc? I am asking this because the big question is "Khoage kya?". Dal is luxury  soon everything will be like that. otherwise fake product khao like "plastic ki rice" synthetic paneer, hormone lauki...urea milk....disgusting.     Strengthening agriculture sector must be a prime importance for any government. But I understand abb government bhi kya kare? half of the GDP is for border security. Ab tou Nepal bhi ho sakta hai. Very complex situation.....

                            I do not totally agree with what Mr. Aiyar saying as I know he is boot licker of Gandi Family. However, yes India has chose Mr Modi on the grounds of bringing down the corruption and on developing India. Being said that, as Mr. Aiyar quoted states that we were deep downed into corruption and stagnated on development during 60 years of UPA rule. I believe Bihar elections would be temporary setback for government to bring some bold reforms which India needs at this point in my opinion. <br/>
On a different note I want to question Mr. Aiyar is that are you or your party really wants India to develop or just want to be in power with tag line Gandhi on your side? I have never seen any constructive criticism or any development agenda from any of opposition parties of BJP. I am saying this because they were just shouting India is going back under NDA govt. But what are you doing? just trying to bring down Mr. Modi or NDA govt. Agree or not NDA is going to be in power for 5 years. You want to waste the time of 5 years just barking on Mr.Modi or atlease contribute some way to development of our country. <br/>
All I heard from any cong leader BJP used to stall all the bills or reforms when they were in opposition, and you are doing the same. What difference does it make between cong and BJP if you two are doing the same. I am common man sir I understand what I understand if you are trying to some good please highlight that not bashing Mr. Modi or BJP. That does not do any good to our nation.

I don't think you can even build a house in 2 years of job and you are expecting prime minister to build a country in 18 months. It feels sad when some people in the country like ours where we had most intellectual people speaks this kind of language.

Aiyer is not thanking Nitish for defeating the BJP. He is thanking him for saving the Congress! Without Nitish the Congress would not have got those 27 seats. An oasis in the desert of the Congress's electoral fortunes. Aiyer knows that Mama and Pappu cannot save the Congress. What to do?

                            As usual I did not read even single sentence of his blog. Congress is finally going to be pushed to 3rd or 4th place in most of the places. You promote regional leaders like Nitish which is good and they will finally take up the place of congress in national stage. Congress is happy by BJPs defeat in a single state election, but they do not realize they are nearing extinction, which is good for the country.

Have you forgotten that as politicians your aim should not be to bring one person down but uplift the country and do whats best for India. Is it fear that perhaps Modi is  doing exactly that,  something right and is not corrupt like the rest of your gang? He has shown us the development he has done for Gujarat. <br/>
What have you done after receiving a degree from a university abroad?Elect an Italian and  1/2 an Indian as your leader? Is that your claim to fame?

                            Tamilnadu produced 2 Manis, a Mani Ratnam the film maker and Mani Shankar, our very dear Mani hater. My sincere advise to u Mani, don't start dancing around as if a criminal politician like Lalu can come back, u can't rule out Modi as u know (u wldn't admit thou), I know and the whole world knows that Modi is the best PM candidate at present in this country. Rahul baba is certainly not a match to him, dur dur tak nehin.

                            Mani- Where did ur conscience go when there was 2G 3G scams, mining scams, allotment of land in give away prices to Mr. wadra??? Where did your conscience go when ur own prime minister declared Bharat Ratna for herself?? What are your views on Emergency if you are so much crying for democracy now?? Where does your conscience go when members of the same family gets posts in your party for last 50 yrs almost??  Mani sir, pls look within before you talk and introspect

                            Mani is right in saying that "Where is BJP in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal?" Same applies to Congress as well. Piggybacking on Regional Parties isn't great sign for totally lost Grand Old Party. I am sure, people in Bihar voted for State Govt. They will surely vote in 2019 looking at National Picture. Claiming Victory for Nitish's smart caste politics must be a shame for so called Grand Old Party. I would suggest Mani to work on Ground in Tamil Nadu to bring few seats for Congress as no Party is willing to even take Congress into alliance. Congress considered a liability there,  and nationwide only organized force is RSS and BJP. Mani can dream something for 2024.

                            And, sycophancy and hatred in your DNA. A good critique such as Mr Tharoor's is a pleasure to read. Yours is venom pure and simple. People will be watching with bated breath about the Nitish development model that you endorse. He didn't do anything spectacular as the railway minister and while he provided electricity and roads , he has not been able to provide jobs or attract industry. Without capitalism there can be no industrial development. So, please spare us the moral outrage. With Laloo at the helm, no bets for guessing what development is going to happen. It's good for democracy that the BJP got a drubbing. They deserved it. But don't take the people for fools. A negative vote is no endorsement for the Congress. And, please don't run with the hates and hunt with the hounds. You can't say the BJP won only because of development promises and lost because of communal agenda. You can't have it both ways. The people know the BJP's DNA and vote for it as much as they vote for change. If BJP wins Assam, we know you sycophants will rush to Mataji and Pappu's defense saying the BJP won by polarising voters. In each election parties rise and fall. That's the nature of Indian politics. Unfortunately, in your ego tussles the ordinary Indian suffers. Hope we have a leader who has the best of Modi and AAP to lead India into the future.

                            Oh, yet another silly article by Mani Shankar Aiyar. In essence, this is what he wants us to believe all Biharis gathered together and decided that Modi should be thrown out (a) because Modi is anti muslim and divisive, (b) Modi is pro-corporate sector and anti-poor (c) under Modi's watch, exports have faltered, economic growth has slowed down and said to themselves ‘oh, what a great contrast to the halcyon milk-and-honey days of the Congress', (d) Modi spends a lot of time abroad and (e) Modi is a clear and present danger to anybody who does not wear a tilak on his forehead. <br/><br/>
And then, the Biharis magnanimously forgave Lalu Yadav, a convicted criminal, and benignly smiled at Nitish Kumar who, in his previous time as the CM (never mind he was arm-in-arm with the BJP then) Bihar blossomed, and also took due note of the presence of the Congress (who?) -- an experienced, guiltless, non-corrupt, pro-people party – in the maha-ghatbandhan, and voted BJP out!<br/>
Only Mani Shankar Aiyar is capable of such jelly-filled logic. <br/><br/>
Everybody knows that BJP lost in Bihar only because of caste politics, because of the unholy, untenable, tenuously-linked, immoral alliance and the resultant poll arithmetics. And because that national embarrassment, Mohan Bhagwat, spoke about reviewing reservation policy (exactly something that congressmen Manish Tewari and Janardhan Dwivedi had said in the past) and the wily Lalu latched on to it and successfully scared the so-called lower-caste people to vote for him. Period. <br/><br/>
Modi's performance in the government – whatever may be one's views on it – had absolutely nothing to do with Bihar election results. <br/><br/>
And nobody knows this better than Mr Mani Shankar Liar.

                            I am hoping that BJP and the Central Government can learn from Bihar's election verdict that they cannot deviate from the stated goal of inclusive development - economic and social. But the choice they have exercised is quite interesting - they have voted for RJD and Congress. These parties, in my opinion, are far worse than BJP. Look at how they have governed in the past and that will tell the answer. But more worrisome news is - Mani Shankar Iyer (not Aiyar) will now be emboldened to write even more of his senseless opinions.

What people expect from political party is development, progress etc. We never asked for beef politics. Shows us policies that can change India into a smart nation. Where is development? Everyone is busy rewriting history to give credit to their favourite freedom fighters. Busy revisiting past and visiting other nations. <br/>
An agrarian nation where farmers are still in 12th century.  Thank god to Green revolution at least it saved the wheat growers in Punjab. Phir bhi ab Khaoge kya? Dal is a luxury now and soon everything will be like that only. Where is a policy that will strengthen the agricultural sector.<br/><br/>
Similarly, no policy in place for population control. Look at traffic jam in Delhi it is really awful to see people a country like that<br/><br/>
Corruption in this technologically advanced world where everything could have been, by now, semi-transparent or transparent. No accountability, no perfect judiciary. we do not know where we heading to may be towards a chaotic world where promises made by netas were never turned into reality.

                            Seems Mani can't write articles without mentioning Gandhi, Nehru and Modi in every one of them. He would pretty much be on the unemployment list if Modi wasn't around.  <br/>
It is clear from the anti-Gujju comments that it is the pseudo-secular crowd that propagates hatred and polarization on communal lines. BJP's campaign was loud and in many places uncalled for but no one should be voting for criminals like Lalu and cohorts. Nitish is capable but will be handcuffed by the "gatbandhan".People expecting development miracles from Day 1 should adjust their expectations. A country that has been looted for the past 60 years in the name of socialism will take time to gather its strength and momentum. Hold your opinion on Modi until he completes a full term.

                            MSA is the happiest person on earth as he is bursting crackers not for Diwali but for BJP nah modi's defeat. How stupid you are MSA and for god sake are you waiting for rebirth to have maturity??? Who enjoys on others failure instead go and drums for Nitish. I don't remember even Modi said anything bad about you but you don't miss any opportunity to spit venom on him.

                            It only shows that in state like Bihar and up development and economic uplift ment means nothing. They like to be coolies only. Otherwise they won't have voted for lallu. They will prefer to be ruled by lallu than

                            Lalus two sons are becoming minister and one the 9th class dropout will be the DY CM after 3 months and not immediately to avoid controversial talk. Lalus daughter will be the health minister. So lalu will teach his wards as to how they can make money by corruption. Yadvas will try to dominate everything and every other community after 6 months when the real drama will start with  the beginning of   jungle raj after one year. we can watch the drama every day.

                            Yes. India is re-discovering its past. That is looters and caste politics has upper hand than pro development initiatives. RJD one of which is led by convicted corrupt politician wins more seat that even your own Nitish Kumar. Please celebrate the beginning of being poor for another 60 years. When all corrupt, looters join together, even good will face difficulties as shown by the election. It will not be long, Bihar will see what Alu to Samosa will do for them. Get ready to move out of the state since many Bhahubalies who are in jails now will come out very soon. Else, what would do 80 MLAs - most of their kins are Bhahubalies.. Mr. Mani, you don't have any real understanding of Bihar like we Bhiharies outside do. We feared this outcome but sadly now it is a realities.

                            This INC-mouth piece has no idea, what just happened. Painting BJP as a communal party is an easy talking point. But it is not Nitish who won, but it is Lalu (the convict) with 80 seats. Most elected MLA's are Yadav, with disproportionate share of Muslims. The caste policy and religious fanatics won. <br/><br/>
Bottom line, Bihar voted as backwards and will remain backwards. Who knows, in about a few years, Lalu will pull the plug, it would fun to watch.

                            Bihar election is reflection of politics which congress and RJD are thriving for last 60 years. Keep country poor , let the election come we will scare Muslims and dalits. Allign with anybody in name of secularism. And how intelligent the voters are can be simple seen people with 56 criminal cases won election from jail without campaign. And yes freebies and reservation are two biggest weapons . will anyone hate going to IIT with 30 marks. Getting a job without qualifying for it.
