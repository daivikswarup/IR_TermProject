Headline::::Sena, Leave Shobhaa De Alone, You've Made This Mistake Earlier



DateTime::::2015-04-10T19:13:00+05:30



(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer. She is working on a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which will be published later this year.)What stands exposed as a result of the Shobhaa De controversy is that the Shiv Sena is yet to come to terms with the fact that its playing second fiddle to the BJP in Maharashtra.
In an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamna on Thursday, the Shiv Sena chose to return to its oft-repeated description of anything liberal as pro-Pakistan. Two of its spokespersons appeared on national television last night, making a mockery of themselves as they tried to outdo each other in sounding belligerent.
Shobhaa had tweeted her criticism of a plan by the Maharashtra government to make it compulsory for all Mumbai multiplexes to screen a Marathi film every evening - the government justified the proposal as an initiative to promote regional cinema, those like Shobhaa De said cinemas must be given the freedom to decide when a regional language film should be screened.  One of her tweets said local snacks like vada pao and dahi missal would be more suitable accompaniments than popcorn.On Thursday, senior Sena leaders had sent texts to journalists and editors of news channels to assemble outside Shobhaa De's residence. On display before the curious camerapersons were the Maharashtrian delicacies that Shobhaa had referred to. The home delivery was far from a peace offering.
Sanjay Raut, the Saamna editor, played his usual role by asking Shobhaa De to leave Maharashtra. The BJP led by its young Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in the process has proved that it has not just been able to surge ahead of the Sena in terms of numbers but has mastered the art of regressive politics practiced by the Sena in the last few months.  The recent introduction of a ban on beef by the state government, the many police cases that have accumulated against the comic group AIB and stars who participated in a public roast - all this has left the Sena feeling that the BJP is stealing its thunder in the right-wing vote bank ahead of important civic elections in the state.
From statements on putting an end to toll taxes to promoting Maharashtrian artists in the state - there is an increasing feeling among the Sena cadre that the BJP has appropriate the Sena's agenda. However, with its farcical protest against Shobha De, the party could do well by remembering how the Marathi voter had thrown them out of power in the past when they targeted Maharashtrian icon PL Deshpande and national hero Sachin Tendulkar.
The party, which made an infamous deal with Enron for a power project when was in office in the 90s, was beleaguered by allegations of corruption. So in the mid-90s, it instituted an award called the Maharashtra Bhushan Puraskar to honour Maharshtrian icons. Noted writer PL Deshpande who was not just a literary genius whose works are included in textbooks in schools and colleges in Maharashtra but was also lauded as a selfless humanitarian. The common Marathi manoos (Maharashtrian for Aam Aadmi) held him on a pedestal; every word written by Deshpande was treated with awe. However, when the same author lashed out at Shiv Sena for its goondaism or hooliganismin the state, Sena chief Bal Thackeray hit back at him calling him a thankless man and said "it was our folly that we presented the award to him". The Sena could do well by remembering the outrage among litterateurs and Maharashtrian scholars like Narayan Surve, then president of the All India Marathi Literature Forum, and historian YD Phadke, who suggested that targeting Deshpande would not be forgiven by voters; and that did happen. The Shiv Sena was voted out of power in 1999 and returned back only in 2014.
Shiv Sena would also want to be reminded that in November 2009 its attack on Sachin Tendulkar had evoked national outrage especially amongst Maharashtrians who treated the cricketer as a demi God. In an interview, Sachin Tendulkar had rightfully stated "Mumbai belongs to India. That is how I look at it. I am a Maharashtrian and I am extremely proud of that. But, I am an Indian first." The comment outraged Shiv Sena so much that in a scathing editorial Bal Thackeray wrote "You said you are proud of being Marathi but are an Indian first. This has hurt the Marathi people. From the cricket pitch you have entered the political pitch. You also said that all Indians have an equal right on Mumbai. What was the need for this? You have become "run-out" on the Marathi pitch. People praise you when you hit fours and sixes. But if you speak against the rights of Marathi people, they will not tolerate it."  A statement uncannily similar to the one made by Saamna on Shobha De who has been an outspoken citizen and a proud Maharashtrian.
In 2015, the Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray who campaigned in the farmer suicide belt of Vidarbha raising the issues of the farmer plight. However that issue was kept on a back-burner with the Sena insecure about the BJP's recent stand on marathi cinema and culture. With its outrage against Shobhaa De, the Sena has sought its fifteen minutes of national news because it believes its leaders were caught napping on the issue of lobbying for  Marathi films. The question is, why is the Shiv Sena, which has burnt itself in the past by humiliating its own icons, repeating the same mistake? Has being out of power for three consecutive terms made the Shiv Sena blind to its own history? Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            The Sena was never known for its intellectual prowess. It never claimed otherwise. It was better known for street level hooliganism. This is what it displayed against De as well. Its constituency consists of poor and uneducated Maharastrians with a chip on their shoulder against "outsiders" who made it big in Mumbai while they could not. They have to pander to that constituency. I have always wondered why a political party should call itself a Sena. To fight against India's enemies? Nah. We all saw what happened in Mumbai during 26/11. All Sena tigers turned into pussy cats safe in their houses watching the action on TV. The real SENA had to come and rescue these pussy cats in their Amchi Mumbai. Instead of digging up pitches to protest against Pakistani teams, Sena leaders should be sent to the Pakistan border to show their prowess as Senapatis against real Pakistani soldiers. Watch the fun.

                            I am sorry for those who are defending Ms Ayub who is trying to teach ethics to us. I wish she has the guts to tell her religionists not to force women to wear burqa, or stop marrying 5 times or participate in family planning. What right does she have to advice Shiv Sena when her own religionists kill millions just the mention of Allah in a wrong way.  Please advise your brothers and sisters to behave first and then teach others.

                            Mr Raut and shiv Sena is always correct. so according to them, we should take away the voting rights of ALL MARATHIS so that parties like Shiv-Sena will not be able to use them as vote-bank and then we will know who the actual leaders of marathis are, who can really work for their uplifetment. shiv sena should have given this idea about 20 years earlier so that Mr Bal tackeray would not have been able to use marathis as vote-bank and shiv sena would have never become a party.<br/><br/>
We  should defintiely take Mr Sanjay Raut's advice.

                            Rana, please, Shobha is a big girl and can fight her own battles.  Wasn't it only recently that Narayan Rane's son Nitesh threatened all sorts of consequences for some perceived slight Nitesh felt?  Frequently, Shobha is offensive for the right reasons and all hail to her.  An example was when she asked when was the right time for Vadra to speak in response to his, Vadra's, jibe at a reporter 'are you serious'.  At other times, she is offensive for the sake of being offensive and she should realise that this will have consequences.  As it happens, Shobha was right to speak out about Marathi films.  Perhaps she should have added, for balance, that India's greatest film director, and regarded as so by all Indians and not just Marathi Indians was Dadasaheb Phalke, a Marathi in whose memorial the greatest film award is made.  Nobody objects that the award is in memory of a Marathi, everybody celebrates that the award is in memory of a great Indian.

                            I don't understand.  When anyone from Hindu fraternity says anything then the media pounces on him/her and criticise them violently for ever but when anyone says against Hindus the same media defends that person and accuses those pouncing on him/her as intolerant and violent and rowdy elements. How freedom of speech changes based on the subject or the person for the media ? They are confused or I am ?

                            In this instance Rana Ayyub's views may have some merit, but as she is a communist (sympathizer) her credibility is very low. She cannot bring herself to expose the hooliganism of left in Bengal. It was the left government that hounded Taslima Nasreen out of Bengal. Credibility is low because communists and their supporters are the most adept liers in the world.

                            Dear writer,<br/><br/>
Instead of watching everything with coloured glass. Please see the reality.Reality is that Mutliplexes are getting concessions from state government on taxes on the basis that they will give some screen space to Marathi movies. However they never give proper screening time to marathi movie. High court order has directed them to show marathi movies between 12 am to 9 pm but they ignored this also. Now Government wants Multiplex owners to show at least 1 movie in prime time is it asking for too much? <br/>
Can multiplex owners do like this in other states like Bengal and south India. Shobha dey's comments were bit overreaction and were purposefully done to instigate Shivsena.

                            Promoting Regional interests is ok, but it cannot be achieved by compulsion. An example is the imposing of Hindi in Tamilnadu. Because of the compulsion measures attempted by the then central Government, Many people who would have normally learnt the language, developed a hatred for it. And missed learning the beautiful language. This has also denied many opportunities to those who did not learn it.(It is also amusing to note that the very politicians who made a career out of the Hindi Agitation were the first to send their children to learn Hindi) There so many other ways to promote a thing and those who compel are actually working against the interest of the Regional cinema.
