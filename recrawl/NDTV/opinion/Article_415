Headline::::Mani Shankar Aiyar on Why AAP Victory is Good News



DateTime::::2015-02-14T22:22:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)
	I do not usually read the comments on my weekly blog because they are mostly so illiterate, misspelled and ungrammatical as to make any perusal of them a waste of time. But I did go through every comment on my last blog explaining the BJP's resounding defeat in the Delhi elections. One theme running through the comments did, I thought, deserve consideration - namely, what did I have to say about the Congress failing to open its account and 63 of its 70 candidates losing their deposits? I intend to do this today, but only after clarifying that I write this column not on behalf of the Congress, but as a way of airing my own opinions on issues of the day. Some of the time, I daresay, this coincides with the official Congress position, but it is precisely because much of the time I am out on my own limb that the Party takes such great care to ensure that I am not its official spokesman. I have too much of a mind of my own to toe anyone else's line.
	 
	I think it was evident to every Congress supporter after the December 2013 Delhi elections that the Delhi voter felt that after giving the Congress three straight wins, it was time for a change. That is par for the course in a democracy. Can you immediately think of any party having won four elections or more in a row? Apart from the Congress' own record of five straight wins in the first five general elections, when our democracy was still very young, I can only think of one: the Sikkim Sangram Parishad. Perhaps the CPI-M will equal that record next time in Tripura and the BJD in Odisha. The point is that defeating the ruling party after giving it three straight wins is the norm in a vigorous democracy.
	 
	What was telling, however, about the December 2013 defeat was the scale of the Congress defeat - down to 8 from a huge, consistent majority. That had everything to do with the reverberations of the India Against Corruption campaign that had caught the imagination of the people of the capital -although, curiously, it had failed to click anywhere else, perhaps because the political elite is nowhere more visible than in Delhi. At a time when IAC was abusing every politician in sight, I had advised Arvind Kejriwal on a TV programme that if he wanted to make a difference, he should stop trying to do it from within civil society and instead enter the political arena. At the time, he appeared to demur, but subsequently formed a political party and threw himself, with energy and innovation, into the only proper sphere for politics in a democracy - which is politics. We knew in the 2013 campaign that his appeal had traction in the city, but I am sure it came as a surprise - albeit a welcome surprise - to Kejriwal himself when he won as many seats as he did. The lesson the Congress had to learn then was that while Delhi's voters were shying away from the Congress they had voted to office for 15 long years, they would not vote for the BJP if they had a credible alternative. That alternative was Kejriwal, then in the wings.
	 
	Although the defeat of the Congress was crushing in 2013, at least it was not a double whammy: the BJP did not get Congress votes and that was a huge relief. For our enemy could never be the up and rising AAP; it was at best a regional rival. The real enemy of the Congress (I deliberately do not use the word "opponent" but "enemy") is the BJP. The BJP and its army of Sangh Parivarists and assorted communal fanatics stands for an India that is the polar opposite of everything that secularist socialist Nehruvians like myself stand for. They represent those who encouraged and caused the murder of Mahatma Gandhi. They venerate the likes of VD Savarkar, author and philosopher of the word "Hindutva". They are those who emulated the massacres of Hindu minorities in Pakistan by carrying out at partition a similar pogrom against Muslim minorities in India. It is their politics that is based on a denial of Indian pluralism, particularly in the religious sphere, of the synthesis and the sharing of spiritual ideas that has characterized the evolution of India's civilization for five millennia. It is they who have nutty notions of the history of India, in particular of the 666 years, from 1192 to 1858, that there was always a Muslim sultan on the throne of Delhi - a period that witnessed the rise of the Bhakti movement, climaxing in the Ten Gurus of Sikhism, under the influence of the egalitarian ideas that had invaded the Indian psyche with the advent of the Message of the Prophet (PBUH), leaving the Hindus in a majority of 76% after close to seven centuries of Muslim political rule.
	 
	It is also they who ignore the entire history of Buddhism being driven out of the country of its birth and Buddhist shrines desecrated that characterized the end of close on a millennium of India having been less a Hindu than a Buddhist and Jain country. It is they who know not that India was the first country in history to have an organized Christian church - the Syrian Christian church that flourishes to this day in Kerala. It is they who have bizarre notions of technological development in ancient India which obscure real achievement with fantasies. The BJP and its cohort comprise an omnipresent threat to the India that all Indians (other than the sanghis) want. Hence, my choice of the word "enemy" to describe them. To all other opponents of the Congress - and they are legion - I restrict myself to the term "opponent".
	 
	In some measure, most Congress supporters recognize that while our fundamental idea of India is shared by the entire non-Congress spectrum from extreme left to right, the Sangh Parivar represents all that we most fear about the future of the India of our dreams. That is why any Congress voter disillusioned - for whatever reason - with the Congress, looks first for anyone other than the BJP to shift his allegiance. We saw that dramatically happening in 1977, when the Congress vote shifted bodily out of the Congress but went to the Jana Sangh only to the extent that the then Jana Sangh dissolved itself in the alternative secular identity of the Janata Party. We also saw it in the decisive rejection of the Jana Sangh, reincarnated as the BJP, at the elections of 1984 - an elections which returned fewer BJP MPs to Parliament from the whole country than the BJP won from Delhi alone in the recent Delhi elections. In the states too, over long years, we have seen the Congress vote repeatedly drift to regional parties and Left Fronts but not towards the BJP until the mid-90s where credible secular alternatives to the Congress did not emerge (Madhya Pradesh, Chhatisgarh etc.). When a credible non-Congress, non-BJP alternative emerges, the Congress vote largely shifts to the secular alternative, not the BJP. We saw this with the long rule of the Samajwadi in UP, of Lalu/Nitish in Bihar, of the Left Front in Kerala, West Bengal and now most spectacularly in Tripura. We have seen this also with the two Dravidian principals in Tamil Nadu and regional parties like the BJD, the Trinamool, the Sikkim Sangram Parishad and the NC/PDP in J and K (generally, if not today, in tandem with the Congress).
	 
	It was, therefore, only to be expected that when a credible alternative to the Congress/BJP emerged in Delhi in the shape of the AAP, some of the disillusioned Congress vote should drift to the secular AAP, whose fundamental philosophy reminds one so much of the pristine Nehruvian Congress. The trouncing of the AAP (and of the Congress) in the country and in Delhi in 2014 was a giant breath of relief at Modi projecting himself as the Sikandar of Development rather than the Forerunner of Hindu Raj. Since the last eight months have seen no development, only slogans, but a great deal of Hindutva, the Delhi Congress voter, who was temporarily deceived into voting for Modi in the general elections, found that with the restoration of credibility to the AAP, he did have a secular alternative to the Congress - and so voted for the AAP. Disillusioned BJP voters also voted for AAP since the committed BJP voter would never vote for the Congress for the same reason that the Congress voter, except exceptionally, does not vote saffron.
	Which still leaves unanswered the question as to why I am gloating over the AAP victory instead of shedding copious tears over the resounding Congress defeat? Very simple, really. When the Delhi voter gets disillusioned with the AAP, he will come back to the Congress, not to go to the BJP. So, assuming the AAP stumbles, as I am inclined to believe it will, we only have to sit it out for five years. That may seem a long time to the BJP. But for the Congress, which has seen many ups and downs in its life of 129 years, five years is but a wink of time. To the distress of those who week after week abuse me, I am sorry to tell them that we will be back, sooner than later. Our preference is always for the last laugh.

                            The usual stupidity. Where is the promised analysis of why the Congress got zero? All this historical bunkum does not wash. It has nothing to do with today's situation. The BJP rules India and the AAP rules Delhi. What about the GOP? For the foreseeable future there will be no Congress except for a few minor states, which also looks unlikely. It is time to pack and go. No two ways about it. In 2013 the BJP got more seats in Delhi than either the Congress or AAP. Remember? And in the Lok Sabha the BJP got all 7 seats. Better avoid peddling tripe. The use by date of the entire Congress is long over. Ta ta.

                            I do not usually read your weekly blog Mr. Aiyar, because they are mostly so full of crap that going through them is a waste of one's precious time...I straightaway jump to the comment section though. All that your blog delivers is jingoism about the Nehru dynasty. I wish you had better things to do for the society...if you have nothing else to do in your free time why not go on a "Swach bharat" campaign..but NO you are too educated for it, aren't you?? You Mr.Aiyar have failed the nation...

                            I must compliment Manishankar for showing the guts to keep writing - or blabbering - the blogs despite reading the reader comments.  By the way, how dare he say that the readers are illiterate.  This is the sheer arrogance that has taken to the shallowness of this educated idiot.  It also takes guts to write a crap like this after defeat after in every elections since May-14. As if the wash out in Delhi with 62 of their candidates losing deposits and vote share in single digit, he has the audacity to articulate such rubbish.  By the way, the biggest enemy of Congress is NOT BJP but the Nehru-Gandhis and the shameless sycophants.  Congress can hope for a revival only if it gets rid of such hopeless and worthless people.

                            So one sided, so overconfident, so "disillusioned" you sound, Mr.Aiyer. You so comfortably choose to ignore the fact that the biggest reason for your loss has been a baffoon called Rahul Gandhi. Each time the congress rose up because they had leaders like Indira and Rajiv, all you have now is a mama's boy whose best pastime would probably be sucking his own thumb while dreaming of his favorite cartoon. The AAP is here to stay Mr.Aiyer. Congressi snobs like yourself should have learnt a lesson or two by now, but alas.

To be honest, I too dont read your full negative minded blog. I only see the heading straightaway to readers comments, Atleast they make little sense. Only 1 question MANI. Forget Delhi. What about the other states Congress lost recently. Mani YOU LOSER.

                            Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyar, I am amazed at your twisted logic which you seem to offer as an intellectual. You seem to have Schadenfreude about BJPs defeat to AAP whilst the congress having not offered an iota of improvement in its ability to communicate its ideas. You are banking on people being disgruntled with the AAP rather than hoping that congress improves its utterly clueless leadership and improving its track record in serving people. 129 years of congress rule or whatever fraction of it, in mostly a time where there was hardly an alternative to congress, is hardly a reason to be proud of. India as it stands could have achieved so much more if and only if its political leaders had served the people in atleast half-honesty. Rather they preferred to loot the country and stash accounts in Swiss accounts. <br/><br/>
With such an article, I really hope that congress does never come to power. Because clearly you are living in denial and havent learnt the lesson to uproot corruption. Seriously have you not ever wondered the magnitude of scams during the congress regime? How greedy are you people? And then you dare to call us the public illiterate. Hopefully you are served a lesson in other constituencies as well.

                            The analysis is extremely analytical to the point that it only says what is good for the Congress. Congress socialism is but only a theory they propogate but do not practice. Their socialism is to give doles and handouts out to the poor and in the process carve out a vote bank for themselves. At no point in India's history did the Congress ever attempt to empower the people of the country (maybe during Nehru's time), more important the poor and the downtrodden. Rather they followed a calculated policy of appeasement and vote bank politics. They broke institutions like Indira Gandhi appointing A. N .Ray as India's Chief Justice and in the process making him supercede 3-4 judges who were senior. They were the advocates of Emergency. They broke the society into its various caste and factions. They identified the religious minorities and made this their base and vote bank of future elections by following a policy of appeasement. They let immigrants from Bangladesh illegally come and settle down in Assam and make them the Congress Party's vote bank.This is how the Congress perfected its winning formula and went on to win election upon election as gloated by mani Shankar Iyer. If Mani Shankar thinks that this winning formula will ever return he is very very mistaken. Indians especially the people of Delhi have awoken to this game plan of the Congress and the BJP. While one appeases the minorities the other tries to polarise the majority. Delhiites are sick and tired of this kind of politics and they have therefore spoken in clear decisive terms.They have banished Congress from the state assembly(at least for 5 years) and allowed BJP to have a token strength of 3 out of 70 in the assembly. And if Mani Shankar is thinking that AAP will fade after 5 years and Congress will return he needs to do a reality check. AAP is here to stay in Delhi.We have to assume that a newbie Political party will prove its mettle and win peoples heart and meet their aspirations. By your own admission it takes 15 years of Government by a party in a state before the anti incumbancy sets in.You will have to wait for 15 years at least. As Bob dylan famously said " come senators, congressmen please heed the call, don't stand in the doorway don't block up the hall, for he that gets hurt will be he who had stalled, there's a battle outside and its ragin',it'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls, For The Times They are a Changing". Prophetic words Mani Shankar Iyer, spoken in 1971 and is as relevent today.

                            Dear Mr Aiyar, Firstly, appologies if my comment is illiterate, misspelled and ungrammatical.<br/><br/>
Its almost 15 years now that I am closely watching Indian Politics. I used to think you are a socialist, and only a few among Congress who did not changed the colour of your skin for short term gains. <br/><br/>
Of late you seems to have turned into a facist. Same sentiments come out everytime you speak, that you are the most capable person who has ever walked this earth. As if, what you think is the best way forward. No new thoughts, no new ideas, just the same rant repeated again and again wrapped up in gramatically correct english (and spelt correctly too, everytime :), probably you have a better spell checker than most of us).<br/><br/>
I do not know why, but I can visualise a few characters from Animal Farm whenever I hear you on TV or read your articles.<br/><br/>
You are a learned person, I will not give any advise. Hope you now understand readers/ Indian citizens' sentiments.

                            DEAR SIR,<br/>
Your use of the phrase "the Message of the Prophet (PBUH)" proves that you are not secular. Your secularism is akin to those who think that secularism is a smart tool in a place where you are in a minority and one that should be junked the very moment you are in power. Actually, sir, secularism means rejection of the unsubstantiated, i.e. God. Being pro-Muslim is not secularism, though you are free to call yourself a secularist. In fact, most of your Muslim friends would choose to kill atheists the moment they get in chance. In fact, your prophet (PBUH) himself ordains that. I think there is a word recently invented. "Sickularist". It should be used more often. Because it describes most aptly people like you.

                            Mani,<br/><br/>
You are still the same old party man aren't you.  As a voter who represents the new generation, I tell you, most of what you said <br/>
is nonsense.  You are still talking the old political language which<br/>
is "The main rival for congress is bjp and so we are happy AAP won".<br/>
It is a pity you people cannot learn.<br/><br/>
The new generation of voters, whom you will find primarily in the cities<br/>
in the age group of 20s-40s want the old establishment out.  They want a<br/>
healthy middle class face at the top , who has a good education, good professional experience, and most importantly good values. Arvind meets all that. Not old and corrupt people like lalu, mulayam and karunanidhi.  Not Sonia or her children either, who will be nobody without their family background.  They cannot rise to the top without<br/>
the family legacy and 130 yr old party's legacy.  Arvind can and did that, by directly connecting with people.  If rahul starts a party on his own, nobody will give a damn.  He just lacks the energy, insight,<br/>
and the right moral values.<br/><br/>
You take care of yourself and Other than your capacity to write in english, you have nothing to offer.<br/>
Good luck.

                            "I do not usually read the comments on my weekly blog because they are mostly so illiterate, misspelled and ungrammatical as to make any perusal of them a waste of time". I hope Aiyer does not have the same impression on people of India at large. Mr. Aiyer, if you think people are illiterate and idiots then it is the fault of 50 years of congress rule. However, politicians can no longer fool people. Thanks to the technology developments around the world. News travels fast and bad news travels faster and people are no longer willing to wait for years to see a positive change. Mr. Aiyer, the mere fact that you have to read the comments to address an important piece of the puzzle (role of congress) in your original article "How Modi and Amit Shah Lost Delhi For the BJP" does not speak high of you.

                            Haha Mani Shankar Aiyyar! Considering the sharp criticism you receive in the comments, it's natural that the only thing that can make you sleep peacefully at night is the assertion that people who comment are 'illiterate'.<br/><br/>
It would be a sheer folly on part of Congress if it continues to believe that 'History repeats itself' and that  'If India is a computer, Congress is its default program' . History does not always repeat itself and comparing the present circumstances to 1980 is simply juvenile. There was a dynamic lady at the helm at that time and barring the emergency period, her decisions displayed her dynamism, decisiveness and power of ideas- abolishing privy purse,nationalizing banks, refusing to take freebies from US, Bangladesh liberation,    . And ofcouse Jawahar Lal Nehru, it's ludicrous when everybody in Congress invokes him to ask for votes. He was a man of ideas and the present leadership.. ha!<br/><br/>
Statements like 'we do not read what is written about us' (Sonia Gandhi), 'illiterate, misspelled, ungrammatical', 'Chaiwala' does not help your cause- trust me. <br/>
You should learn a thing or two from Shashi Tharoor on how to be in sync with the present times and how to criticize others the Mark Antony( Julius Caesar) way. You should really learn to articulate your views and your party's stand while in no way sounding cynical about just anything and everything.<br/><br/>
The takeaway from all your articles is this- Modi is authoritative, dictator, illiterate, chaiwala..... This makes all your article a lot less appealing and believe me I would never want to read your article if NDTV would not have hosted it. Most of the times, just scrolling down and giving it a quick glance is what I do. Because your opinion reeks of arrogance, non sensical pride and above all gross bias- there is just nothing for the reader to learn or think about. <br/>
No wonder, the funniest line of this blog is- 'I have too much of a mind of my own to toe anyone else's line'<br/><br/>
AAP is here to stay and the entire Congress is being too hopeful if it thinks it cannot become a viable force in other states. 10 years from now- in 2024, it would be a party to look forward to i.e if they avoid making many mistakes. Meanwhile, unless and until BJP messes up badly with respect to minority rights/ freedom, it is here to stay till 2024. So you are nowhere in the picture for the next 15 years unless you fix up your act. Considering the number of sycophants in Congress, this seems to be a herculian task!<br/><br/>
Goodluck and Goodbye!

But we are literate enough to recognize this fact and to keep congress away from power.

                            I haven't studied at St. Stephen's college but I did have the fortune to study under good teachers in low profile Gujarati medium schools where I was taught humility (Indian civilization's main pillar upon which any structure of knowledge is built). Where was this pristine "gyan" of similarity between AAP (BJP-B, remember?) and Nehruvian congress till now? Please at least be consistent if you cannot be humble. <br/>
Also, this is really a shallow writing. Instead of hoping for AAP to do well for the people, the author is only assuming they will fail and that the Congress party will be back to power as a last laugh. Really? Is that all you care about? Is this your so called Gandhian culture? Dr. Swamy rightly called you "Sonia Gandhian" considering your elitist way of thinking and power hungry thoughts. Yes, Panchayati Raj can also come from an elitist mindset.<br/><br/>
I usually don't read your blogs or comment on blogs here, but the sub-title below your title caught my attention, and your complain of badly written comments (which I don't like either) made me write this. Having said this, I usually don't miss any videos where you're participating in a debate. Pure Entertainment!

                            Firstly stop gloating. It is not your victory!<br/><br/>
While it is true that your hold on the English language is good, there is absolutely no need for you to gloat over the grammar (or lack of it) in the comment section. On the other hand, if you subscribe to "grammar of inquriy" then you would realize that the first person you need to give this 'gyan' is to Rahul baba, yeah that Shakespeare who gave us the famed quote "This morning, I got up at night" among many others.<br/><br/>
Your "advise" to Arvind Kejriwal is available for everyone to watch on youtube. That was not advise - It was you throwing a cocky challenge at him (with complete conviction that you and your party can beat him if he indeed enters politics). To AAP, you are what Hera was to Heracles; AAP has just completed one of many labors (While one could cite ample Indian mythologies as example, I chose this only to show how lost you are! We take pride in Indian culture AND in the World culture).<br/><br/>
Fanning Modiphobia would do you no good either. There is no, I repeat, Modiphobia. If at all there is then it is in the coterie of people who are either Politicians or those getting TV space in the Media. Even among this coterie it is NOT for the fear of India losing its secular values, I am sure. <br/><br/>
Mr.Modi does not have a remote control on OUR secular thoughts and practice. I say this as a Hindu! Your and the media's constant harping of "Secularism" to Hindus is shameful reflection of what you have left, as impression, of us. Undeterred by all the noise you have made we continue to remain as Hindu as we can - which is great dollops more than the "Secularism" that you preach. <br/><br/>
If you really feel the itch to advise then please do to:<br/><br/>
1. The party ruling Uttar Pradesh. The constant minority appeasement is not Secularism by your standard. The millions of Hindus take it in their stride (till the next election!) - This is Hinduism that you choose to ignore.<br/>
2. The state which you were ruling - J &amp; K. The only voice you hear from that State is of Kashmir. Why? When was the last time you heard anything from Jammu? Secular, indeed!<br/>
3. What is Kashmir culture? Apart from the hogwash Kashmiriyat - tell us another cultural capital that Kashmir has tapped into. Secular, indeed!<br/>
4. Name one place of Hindu worship that Congress governments in the past has allowed the luxury of Article 25 - Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice. I leave out propagation since it is not in Hindu psyche. Look at Ayodhya, Datta Peeta, Tirupathi (Land allotted to Minorities and conversion) - these are to name a few! <br/>
5. What has been the steps taken to stop immigration from neighboring states? The root cause of many evils!<br/><br/>
One could sit across for weeks to highlight the hypocritical nature of your arguments/opinion. This would only amount to pouring water on a boulder (yeah, this is Indian analogy to restrain oneself from spending too much time on wasteful activities). We, Hindus, continue to go ahead with our lives peacefully for we consider you a bad karma - herein comes our tolerance.

For how does one address a senile, old elitist, the oh so secular and Nehruvian leader of a bygone era, as anything but "kaka".  Weren't you the same person who called Mr. Modi a "chai wallah"? Does a secular, socialist have airs of such arrogance? What makes you, O Mani Kaka, the purveyor of people's sentiment that somebody who has risen from the masses? But you are beyond redemption. Words of your articles have eloquence without meaning. Comments to your articles, on the other hand, regardless of your thoughts on their grammatical value, are so much more lively, entertaining and full of core values that a simple common person like me can relate to. If that is the value you offer, I.e. The ability for NDTV followers to access comments to your rantings, you still have value. Which is similar to that of a cashiered, yet cantankerous old curmudgeon that continues to recount "what could have been".<br/>

                            Mr Aiyar  Firstly I am surprised you do not read the comments on your own blog.  These comments are like gold dust. <br/>
Not everybody is as proficient as you are in english but the most 'illiterate' of the lot is able to put his point across. <br/><br/>
Learn to accept criticism when you choose to happily criticise others. Such arrogance and elitist culture has left congress in such a state.  <br/><br/>
Don't be under the illusion that people of India will just vote congress back into power if you just 'sit it out'.  I get the feeling that those days are gone.  While BJP retained its 33% vote share the congress has lot most of its vote share in Delhi compared to a year ago. <br/><br/>
If you do some work on the ground, change your party's attitude of putting your faith in the 'gandhis' who live in a different world and become more honest and clean in your dealings then maybe there is a chance.<br/><br/>
Don't worry the people of India know how to keep Mr Modi and BJP on the straight and narrow.

                            Probably this is why you will keep loosing elections. you like to get the opinions of only intellect people and not from common man. Language is meant only for communication and you were not born in US or UK where you cannot make what we are commenting. But you will come to us(illetrate with no common sense) to get votes. I am a loyal BJP supporter and will remain so. However I like AAP more than Congress. Atleast they are not seeking votes on name of  secularism. They have plans for development which every Indian will appreciate.And look at your thought process .You want AAP to fail and so that you can get back your votes. Shame on you sir. You will not think of any development . In your Congress ruled Kerala state ,scam after scam appears daily and you will not iniate any action , but you want AAP to become like you and you can get their votes.Sir , please Dont worry about secularism . This is India and Congress came to power only from 1947. Indians have a great culture and people know how to co exist with people having different faith.Think of something good so India can develop and be corrut free nation.<br/>
Please excuse me for my language . I am an average Indian and do not hold any degree from Cambridge.

                            hey Mani - Do you actually believe anyone reads your column ? They scroll right down to the comments section to discuss your arrogance, ignorance and your hypocrisy. You have remained a vile, angry and sore loser ...take care of your health.

                            Well done Mr. Aiyar! This is one of your finest! Your this quality is at the core of Congress and is the biggest contributor to your doom! You have so elaborately described that all of Congress' rout is actually just an experiment by people of India, nothing to do with Congress' performance at all! We just wanted to try another party, like another restaurant for the weekend, and we will come back to Congress by default. Sir, what more do you want as a wake up call? Your party, your leadership, your ideology and your conscience are all at rock bottom. Maybe people have not accepted BJP as your alternative, but they HAVE rejected you! <br/><br/>
You mean to say that the maximum term for a government in a democracy is 15 years? You think people would have chosen AAP if Congress had done the right thing in Delhi? AAP came to being because of corruption in Congress. So please dont gloat if your votes have gone to them. Each transfer of vote is a testament of your corruption. <br/><br/>
Lastly, if you really wanted to write about why Congress has failed, talk about your misgovernance, corruption, comical and farcical leadership and what introspection is required. We would appreciate that.

                            I don't care if this bloated, vainglorious, nincompoop reads my comment or not, but for this windbag whose overbearing attitude and class disctinctions clearly came out in the open when he  superciliously proclaimed that a particular, former chaiwala would be given the permission to serve tea at an AICC session, to call himself a "secularist socialist Nehruvian", is something this nation cannot accept.<br/><br/>
BTW, Mr. Pedant, where is the comma, when you use so many adjectives to describe yourself and people like you (in the Congress?), as Nehruvian?<br/><br/>
I found the last sentence particularly terrifying. Imagine having this loudmouth and his cronies in the Congress; all vying with each other to bend backwards to lick the feet of the Gandhis,  back in power! <br/><br/>
That's the stuff of our nightmares.

                            It is disgusting to read a person with your education lacks the simple patriotic feelings. Can't you for once rise above the politics and for once in your life think of this great nation. I mean  you want AAP to fail so that stupid Congress can come to power and do what please elaborate and what glorious history of Congress are you talking about anyway. Remove the Congress glasses and look into the real facts.

                            Mr Mani Shankar Aiyer - The first line in your opinion clearly shows why the congress was decimated -"they are mostly so illiterate, misspelled and ungrammatical" - End of the day, the congress is still not realizing that it is still the voice of the people! And it shows up on the ballot box with all the grammatical errors that it may have :) Whether you try to make sense of them is your problem - not theirs.

First you call the readers of your column and who do not agree with you idiots, by saying they are grammatically wrong to your superior english ?<br/>
then you call the entire indian voter as being fooled ??<br/>
Seriously ?? Do you mean this ??<br/>
Now do you see the reason for your defeat everywhere ??<br/>
C'mon, try to understand !! Delhi where you ruled 15 years in a row, 62 out of 70 candidates losing their deposit ?? Seriously ??<br/>
Can you please go and check with Mr. Vadra if he knows the Nehruvian Ideology you are talking of ??? Seriously ??

                            The problem with the writer is that he sees himself as a black man in the white world of the Nehru-Gandhis (not the national bania but the fokut chhodu parsi); hence, his self sense has been castrated. Oh, pity the poor blacky!

                            I was hoping for some hint of introspection from Mani in this piece. He set up it up that way in the beginning. But this betrays Congress's grand plan --- WAIT. No introspection, no reevaluation, no reinvention despite everything that has been happening for more than a year. Just wait and this too shall pass.<br/><br/>
Mr. Aiyar, the average anti-BJP person is deep in thought, wondering where he might have wrongly judged BJP, and where he should give them the benefit of doubt.  If you don't try and do something to intersect that thought process, showing that you have some sign of life, your party will be consigned to flames. Personally, your article motivates me to consign your party to flames myself. I have read about Nehru just as you have, and invoking his name isn't going to help you. In fact, regrettably, it is hurting Nehru.<br/><br/>
Literate enough for you?

                            Mr. Aiyar I am shocked that you have used the word "enemy" for BJP. By your analogy all those who vote for BJP are also your enemy. How can Modi Ji or BJP be enemy as they have been given a massive mandate by the people of India whom you describe as illiterate and fools. How naive you are and it shows that you and other top brass of Congress will never learn your lesson. I have little trust in Arvind Kejriwal and know he will never be able to fulfill the promises he has made. But, for sure he has acknowledged his mistakes and apologized. That shows his honesty and sincerity which I am afraid you completely lack. Delhi elections have been won by AAP because of different local issues which have no connection with the popularity of BJP. Even some of ardent supporters of AAP have acknowledged that they will like to have BJP in the centre. So, Mr. Aiyar your analysis is all wrong when you think that AAP vote will swing in your favour when they eventually get disillusioned.

                            You poor old politician.. pack your bags, seek out your pension and get ready for retirement. Technology has changed the world and no more can political parties like the the Congress and BJP thrive, with their greedy agenda and total lack of empathy for the struggling mass of this country. I know you politicians think that history is on your side, and Congress will come back to power in the end,but mark my words. The BJP's voter base is the conservative hindu, who will still be there in the future, but unless you guys suddenly get a conscience and start thinking welfare of the people, the Congress' days are numbered. The secular people of India have found a new alternative which actually cares for its people. The AAP is a 'Congress' which should have been!

Mani, my friendly advise to you Plz Stop being "person centric <br/>
(i.e nehru-gandhi-ophilic)and aim a ideology centric- Secular/Strong Republic/Semi Social &amp; Capitalist Free Society. Becoz even today that old saying taught in school is true.."Too much is too bad"..nothing is life tastes good if it is too much ranging from a sizzling tasty meal to sizzling hot girl to nehruvian secular socialism, everything needs moderation and you seem to miss just that point !<br/>
I was/partly am Congress supporter only for its published ideology sans its practical performance, so if AAP has somewhat "inspired" from your ideology and performs better congress needs to to rethink what next ?

                            'I do not usually read the comments on my weekly blog because they are mostly so illiterate, misspelled and ungrammatical as to make any perusal of them a waste of time.'<br/><br/>
Arrogance personified. Congress personified. Congress needs more people like you to keep people away from voting for the party. <br/><br/>
More-literate-and-grammatical-than-all-of-your-detractors Sir, <br/>
You'll sit out 5 years because of AAP, 5 more years for another non-Cong alternative (that you'll be happy for) and so on and so forth till you realize that your health no longer allows you to write such inane columns. If you do not see the writing on the wall that congress voters are now voting 'Anything but congress', you should wake up and smell the coffee. <br/><br/>
If you are literate enough to read the numbers, you'd know the BJP vote-share remained almost unaltered and you know what erosion of 50% of your vote-base means to your party in the first-past-the-post system.<br/><br/>
I feel deeply saddened that I wasn't able to read your thoughts when your shoulders carried a logical head (presuming that there was ever such a time).

                            Mr Ayiar, I am glad that you took your valuable time to give a reply for the comments which I think is good and must. After I read through the reply you gave for the comments, I am still not sure If your reply covered why Congress has failed miserably in the Delhi elections. Instead I still read a lot about criticizing BJP. And I agree that people needed a change and that's why they chose AAP, but the change people wanted to see is about politics and not just for a change from 15 golden years of congress governance. I hope you get to read this and don't concern about any grammatical mistakes but the message.

                            Once again a simply useless blog. the problem with MSI and his ilk is, they confuse good English with high intellectual thought. This blog is a very good example. If you want to learn good English both grammatically and otherwise, you would do well to read this. But if you really want some substance, you would do well to look elsewhere. Typical of Congressi way of doing things. Thank god, Congress mukt Bharat is almost achieved. Thank you MSI for putting all your might behind this vision of Father of our nation, the great Mahatma himself.

When they write or shout in tv programs i feel thousand votes go to the opposition.  People like aiyer are so far away from ralities that when he used to talk on tv shows people laugh on his ideas. He is a joker. How proud he feels when he say that he asked kejriwal to contest elections and now congress is nowhere in delhi. Imagine after ten year what will aiyer will say

Considering 1984 glory (Last time Congress got majority on its own), because of your dirty politics BJP rose from 2 to 282 and you reduced from 404 to 44 Right? Set your house in order before preaching others. How come Congress voters those who gave you 400 seats aligned with BJP. Oh all voters are disillusioned!<br/><br/>
Your time is over, go home and relax spend your evenings with some grace.<br/><br/>
P. S. - Dont dream that all AAP voters will come back to Congress.
