Headline::::Who's Really Insulting India? It's Not Students.



DateTime::::2016-02-16T19:16:00+05:30




                                On February 14, Home Minister Rajnath Singh spoke to the media about the JNU controversy.
He said the protests at JNU in support of Afzal Guru, who was hanged three years ago, had the backing of Hafiz Saeed, the chief of terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. The Home Minister's comments came after the Delhi Police warned students of punishment for anti-national activities and cited, as an example, a tweet that it seemed to believe was put out by Hafiz Sayeed.
The tweet had been doing the rounds on social media with some pointing out that it seemed to be posted from an imposter account.
That proved to be correct. And the Home Ministry then offered an awkward explanation claiming that the Lashkar link was based on "inputs from different agencies".
This was not an isolated example of "huh?" remarks on JNU from the ruling party.
For example, consider these statements on TV debates in the last one week by BJP spokespersons, many of whom showed a rare display of what can generously be called their emotional side.
Sudhanshu Trivedi on a debate on Times Now said Leftists cannot be called Indians and they are anti-nationalists. In another debate on Times Now, Sambit Patra asked co-panelists, the journalist Saba Naqvi, and Waris Pathan, the spokesperson for Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM, to chant "Bharat Mata ki jai" and prove their patriotism to the motherland.
On Monday, Ashok Kumar Sharma, a top leader of the Hindu Mahasabha, a right-wing party, issued a statement saying "Nathuram Godse was a thinker, philosopher, learned writer and a great patriot. He was, he is and he will remain so". Why Patra and his party refused to slap sedition charges on him or ask them to chant the glory of Bharat Mata is anybody's guess.
Last week, on another TV debate on NDTV India which had this journalist on the panel, ABVP's Sourav Sharma, joint secretary of the JNUSU, in complete disrespect to the guru shishya parampara advocated by Education Minister Smriti Irani, lashed out at his Professor, Mridula Mukherjee, calling her an anti-national sympathizer. To which Professor Mukherjee responded that like a good teacher, she could only reprimand and forgive her student who seemed to be misled.
In Delhi, BJP state legislator OP Sharma, who has in the past made sexist comments about Alka Lamba of the Aam Aadmi Party, also flaunted his "patriotism" by thrashing a Left activist outside a Delhi court which was to hear the case of the arrested JNU student, Kanhaiya Kumar. This amidst lawyers attacking journalists in full view of the Delhi Police who stood there as mute spectators. Note the Delhi unit of the BJP has supported Sharma, and Delhi Police Chief BS Bassi has seconded the politician who admits that he beat up the activist, but that he didn't start it. In an interview today, Sharma said that he was not an absconder and that Bassi could have arrested him.A chilling account by Sonal Mehrotra, a journalist with NDTV, says, "They looked at me and said, 'Delete the video or you are next'. Then, 'Delete the video or we will break your phone and break your bones...Behind those 15 angry goons stood 4-5 cops. I asked them to intervene but they simply left the courtroom.'" Delhi police commissioner who went hunting tweets for any anti national sentiments that could have risen in favor of JNU is yet to make any arrests.
The above-mentioned details are all facts, none have been quoted from the famous Samuel Taylor poem Kubla Khan, which gives details of an imaginary world. Any resemblance of the current state of affairs to the climax scene of Kundan Shah's "Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron", a satirical comedy is purely coincidental and sad.
Kanhaiya Kumar, the JNU students' union president, addressed a gathering of students on the JNU campus last Thursday following which he was arrested on the charge of sedition for taking part in a march earlier where alleged anti-India slogans were raised. One is yet to see any footage of Kanhaiya making pro-Pakistan statements but here is an excerpt from his speech: "The Constitution and Babasahab Ambedkar talk about corrective measures. The same Babasahab Ambedkar talks about abolishing capital punishment. The same Babasahab Ambedkar talks about freedom of expression. And we want to uphold the Constitution, we want to uphold our right."
Former Attorney General Soli Sorabjee whose word on judicial matters is considered sacrosanct has termed the charges of sedition against JNU students deplorable. In an investigation I covered in 2010, from the Naxal-infested Gadchiroli area of Maharashtra, the Congress-led regime had arrested students under the draconian Unlawful Activities Prevention Act) for possessing literature on Baba Saheb Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh.
When Narendra Modi took office as Prime Minister in May 2014, he promised the youth of the country that he would steer this country towards greater heights and promised them his unflinching support; the PM has quoted Rabindranath Tagore and Ambedkar extensively in most of his speeches, and considers them his inspiration.
The youth of this country watched as he teared up when talking of Dalit student Rohith Vemula who committed suicide last month after a Hyderabad university suspended him amid allegations by a union minister of anti-national activities on campus. Rohith's main offense was that the ABVP had accused him of assaulting its leader. Rohith and his friends had said they protested the hooliganism of ABVP workers who vandalized the screening of a film on Muzaffarnagar.
Sounds familiar?
As news of JNU students making pro-Pakistan remarks emerged, most Left liberal intellectuals, academics, activists condemned it in the harshest words. Nobody has offered a word of appreciation for these sentiments despite attempts to legitimize them under the garb of free speech. But where is the evidence of Kanhaiya Kumar's seditious behaviour?
Is the foundation of the Indian republic so weak and sensitive that it was shaken by the alleged statements of a few students?
Dear Prime Minister, the youth of this country are waiting for you to voice your sentiments when the spokespersons of your party questions equate dissent and debate on campuses as anti-national. The esteemed members of your party have in the past asked national icons to move to Pakistan - none of them were labeled seditious by civil society or the media.
Dear Smriti Irani, isn't it cringe-worthy when your party members find one university after another to be dens of anti-national activities isn't it disturbing to have your party spokesperson demand an individual on a debate prove his patriotism by chanting "Vande Mataram"?
There is a reason why so many people are objecting to this government's escalating confrontations with students.
Who is insulting our youth - and our country?(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer.

                            Ms Ayyub and others like her - It has become a fashion or in-thing to critisize everything and anything that the government does, with a venomous thought that if govt has done it, it has something wrong in it. Do you all remember the beef controversy, youth who never ate beef wanted to eat it just for the sake of being part of the crowd, setting aside their inner belief. Yes, each individual is free to chose his/her actions BUT the same individual seems to be making silly decisions just to be part of their larger group of friends. Looking at videos, when pro-Afzal slogans were shouted, few were just lost like where did that slogan come from, but continued just to be in the crowd! Youth needs to wake up, think what they do and then action on it.

                            Quoting Balasahib ambedkar by Kanhiya seems opportunist as Mr Ambedkar also didn't support reservation in educational system to the extent that it is today. Though politicians are responsible for making laws, people using those laws are equally responsible. Mr Kanhiya should accept the principle in its entirety and not use it for convenience.

                            Dear Rana Ayub, it could very well be a youthful error yet, it is a slogan against the country and needs to be investigated. Organizations like ISIS, Alquaida were also started with slogans from somebody. Middle east unrest and Civil wars started with a slogan from one that has gone on for past 5+ years. So, as a responsible Citizen, we need to investigate the roots of the slogan and ensure that it will not cause unrest within the society. I hope you would read this and understand the message and support the same as a responsible citizen of India.

How can you chant against your country and for secession. If these are not anti-national activity then what could be. This country is fighting from separatists and now new breed of intellectuals suggestion it's ok.

                            Why would not I believe that you are also trying to hide the truth by giving a pretext that JNU is an isolated case and students may have been "misled". Where is your intellect, and patriotism? Are you going to justify everything? Is this the kind of tolerance all intellectual award returning brigades were talking about few months back? Then hell with all your logic and viewpoints. I don't care whatever logic you want to put forward here, fact remains that there are something at least for which you need to be rational and patriotic in your thinking! For once I feel that all right leaning political parties are absolutely right and people like you have taken a bit too far this time. Enough of this double standard and double speak, hell with fellow Indians like you, I am ashamed!

There is no justification for the anti national students and their so called "professors" to indulge in such blatant anti national activities. They must be held accountable. Alleged assault on JNU students and reporters is a separate issue. It should be investigated and dealt with accordingly. Please don't try diversionary tactics.

                            It seems even issues of national unity are being compromised because you are Anti Modi. Some students of JNU did many Anti National activities by organizing events in support of Known Terrorists. Police took action, arrested the accused, and they will file a chart sheet. Court will decide if the charges are true or Not. What was a simple law and order problem by a minuscule section of JNU was exploited by self serving politicians such as Rahul Gandhi and others. No Doubt, This being such an emotive issue every one's passions will be raised. <br/><br/>
If you just forget according to your convenience what happened at JNU, and blame just the reactions, you are being unfair to a major part of our society who believe what happened at JNU was wrong, and the treatment they got should have been much more worse to set an example to others.

                            This is what is called selective outrage and selective journalism. The writer mentions points which she feels suitable for her version of thoughts. She again forgets that all this is fallout of the anti-india activities that were going in the campus on the name of free speech. Each time these self declared 'secularists' and upholders of 'peace' concentrate on the later part of an event, but conveniently forget the events leading up to the situation. <br/>
She mentions that the "most Left liberal intellectuals, academics, activists condemned it in the harshest words". But fails to cite any proof of that in this article, while giving selected statements by BJP as a proof to drive her point. I have watched 4 to 5 discussions on various channels including the ones she mentions in this article. And NOT ONCE did any of the left leaning commentators has condemned these anti-national activities in 'harshest' of the words as she says. Each of these 'intellectuals' have mainly talked about how its is freedom of speech and the government should allow students to put forth their thought even though they talk about destroying India. <br/>
NDTV has been crying for the last 2 days in all its shows about how once of their reporter was beaten up. Some select journalists also took out a march in protest of this 'goondaism'. But why did they conveniently forgot to take a march against the anti-national activities is anybody guess. <br/>
So dear writer. Please STOP taking moral high ground on all issues and if you want respect for your thoughts and ideas, please first try and respect others thoughts and ideas. If giving 'anti-india' slogans is freedom of speech then Sambit asking to say 'Bharat mata ki Jai' is also freedom of speech.

                            Pathetic article as expected. When slogans of "India Go back" and "Bharat ki barbadi" are raised, it is not dissent - it is a clear cut case of sedition. I am disgusted with this bunch of psuedo seculars who are trying to justify these actions by the so called "students". In case you did not know a DU professor has already been arrested and he has confessed that things had gone out of hand. Why isn't that news being published. Just because you hare closing your eyes don't assume that the world is blind.

                            The only solution is to keep all political parties out of educational institutions across India. Students can and should have different ideologies but no political party should be allowed to take advantage of this. Most of all MSM, with all its political affiliations should also be kept out of educational institutions. I am yet to see a decent newsperson give a neutral view without adding their own masala to the story.

                            Everything that is wrong with our universities, including the lack of basic discipline and absence of academic excellence can be directly attributed to the 60 years of Congress misrule. Whether Afzal Guru was a terrorist, guilty of plotting to attack Parliament and related issues are within the jurisdiction of our police and courts. They are NOT issues to be agitated upon by university students, and definitely not on campus. Go outside and do it. The problem is that outside the campus nobody cares two hoots for these self proclaimed activists. And every issue in the article attributed to so called Hindutva and RSS activists are allegations of threats. Nobody was killed. Compare that with what happened during the various Mumbai blasts and other terrorist activities in Kashmir and elsewhere and you get the picture. Who the actual terrorists are, and their well wishers within the political parties here.

But , thankfully, India still remains a majority patriotic country.<br/>
Being an alumnus of a university of the same pedigree as JNU , I can very easily identify who are real students and who are there to make nuisance. Many of those guys shouting "India ki barbadi tak ...." look well into their 30s. No sure what kind of research takes so much of time.<br/>
Its high time that universities should be declared as a sacrosanct place and ONLY education should be promoted over there.<br/>

The larger question.Does the JNU have a very deeply communist ideology with a very leftist curricula and is there bias towards communists while selecting faculty?.Does a university which gets free monies be used by a certain political ideology as its own bastion?

This is absolutely unacceptable on the part of the JNU students and they shall be dealt with as per the law of the land. Now coming to your biased and myopic views on what's right and what's not ... We have seen enough of that evidence wherein you shout where there is no substance to back your argument. The very youth that had voted for Modi is happy and can see the evil designs of so called secular parties trying to create problems just before the parliament sessions. We understand we shall deal with that as well. So, chill a get a life.

                            Rana Ayyub conveniently you ignored many things. YOu just focusing on how BJP or Police or Lawyers behaved after this incident. Can I ask simple question. Forget about Gilani or Guru these all studets says they were not involved in slogans lets agree to that point for a while but when anti Indian slogans were shouted what these CPM patriots were doing their hands were tied? what hold them from stopping those slogans ?<br/><br/>
I think your cry on how BJP police behaved is really look irrelevant freedom of speech can not be up to that extent. <br/>
Off course Nathuram was bad and these guys celebrate him is worst but they don't sing and anti national or split India slogans over there. There can be difference of Ideology Many follows Mahatma Gandhi many dont but with that they dont harm India. But these slogans in universities yes it does harm in India.<br/><br/>
Don't be opportunistic I know some time going against the public sentiment gives publicity but this is something serious. We grow up singing Vande Mataram in our schools and colleges what bad happen to these guys suddenly they coming with this ideology ? <br/>
Is it just a political stunt to get early publicity and in to main stream as I thuoght over every possible things but dont find a reason. You getting a free education funded by tax payers of India getting every possible comfort compare small time villager can get in India. What made you sing these songs of dark ? I would have liked if someone come up with this analysis. This really concerns me.

                            Nationalism is a realisation of ones identity. I don't find much difference between the fools of JNU who have totally lost it and groups who think they are rightist with out even knowing and trying to understand what is Right ? What is the right of the people of our great country. We still have lots and lots of problem to deal with, most importantly 'Poverty'. Enough of problems and its analysis, can these so called Nationalist speak about solutions. Can we be a bit more creative towards our society. There are long standing historical issues of injustice and equity in this country. We still witness homeless people dying of hunger and at the same time have super rich people showing off everything money can buy. We still have average citizens of this great country desperately trying to get a loan for his/her dire needs and at the same time have rich citizens not paying back bank loans. We Have Enough Of Problems but no solutions. When the western world laughs at us, still think we are snake charmers land. We must develop strong characters and stop behaving like fools. This is our time to develop as a economy and as a society and I don't think that the foundation of our republic is that weak. Let us not get persuaded by what Neta's and Abhinetas says or what our real time media reports. There's a lot of work in hand we all have to deliver to make our country the Best. And please stop thinking of any ideology, institution, or our political class represents our great nation. Time is important stop wasting it. P.S Media: All negative news are great news, but lets change that trend now.

He killed a person whose political beliefs he did not like. the court punished him to death. every crominal is not anti-national. You can not call Nathuram Godse anti-national. He was a criminal and he was punished by law.<br/>
So let us stop comparing Nathuram Godse with the anti-national.<br/>

Really ?<br/>
regarding JNU thing , i wish he never comes out .People like you bring shame to country .Have some dignity being a  India , Criticizing India is not the only way of being in light .Be positive in life , Do some yoga and have positive people around you . <br/>

                            This is what is called selective outrage and selective journalism. The writer mentions points which she feels suitable for her version of thoughts. She again forgets that all this is fallout of the anti-india activities that were going in the campus on the name of free speech. Each time these self declared 'secularists' and upholders of 'peace' concentrate on the later part of an event, but conveniently forget the events leading up to the situation. <br/>
She mentions that the "most Left liberal intellectuals, academics, activists condemned it in the harshest words". But fails to cite any proof of that in this article, while giving selected statements by BJP as a proof to drive her point. I have watched 4 to 5 discussions on various channels including the ones she mentions in this article. And NOT ONCE did any of the left leaning commentators has condemned these anti-national activities in 'harshest' of the words as she says. Each of these 'intellectuals' have mainly talked about how its is freedom of speech and the government should allow students to put forth their thought even though they talk about destroying India. <br/>
NDTV has been crying for the last 2 days in all its shows about how once of their reporter was beaten up. Some select journalists alos took out a march in protest of this 'goondaism'. But why did they conveniently forgot to take a march against the anti-national activities is anybody guess. <br/>
So dear writer. Please STOP taking moral high ground on all issues and if you want respect for your thoughts and ideas, please first try and respect others thoughts and ideas. If giving 'anti-india' slogans is freedom of speech then Sambit asking to say 'Bharat mata ki Jai' is also freedom of speech.

                            It is sad that the commentary has shifted by Ms. Rana to the issues that not relevant. The key issue is the issue of freedom of speech - is at absolute? By the same vein Ms. Rana should not object to what Pravin Togadia or Sakshi Maharaj speak abhorrent stuff. She would be on all channel if one of the Hindu leader speak about the minority community. Why is there a call for action in those cases and not in this. If students stop focusing on learning and indulge in anti-national activity, it is important for teachers to correct and help them getting informed. However the teachers leaning on to the Leftist ideology would fuel this and turn these students into Maoists. I think it is time for Government to take strict action and re-consider funding such institutions. Place like JNU can get students to pay for all this nonsense.

                            Rana is absolutely correct!!!!!!!!!! BJP, RSS, VHP, and all those, who are related to each others are anti-national. And who are pro-national ? Afzal Guru, Prof Mukherji, Rana Ayub, NDTV, Rahul gandhi and whole congress and left parties. Why ? Becaouse their so called ideology is "different"

                            Oh, such a eloquent article to blame everyone else -- particularly BJP, RSS and anyone who opposed the anti-national activities. Of course, the special JNU caste can do no wrong.. all the videos are doctored.<br/><br/>
Ms Rana and cohorts know for sure the Tweet was fake since guess what Mr Hafiz or his sidekicks told them. Do not trust and let Police and IB do their home work!! Better still why do we even need police when we have the JNU rebels to protect us ? Why are we so worked up.. this is such a peaceful country where there are no violence whatsoever.<br/><br/>
And what ever violence happened is all because of Modi, RSS and BJP. It has always been the case. So once we get rid of the popular mandate govt, Ms Rana and cohorts can write more articles and dance on streets and invite Mr Hafiz to JNU for a special lectures and sessions.

                            Is it too hard to get those 'deleted videos' back? There are many softwares in the market.  Then show them.

                            On the name of FOS, don't write nonsense. Please have healthy drinks to improve brains. The JNU culprits should be punished including the media people who supported them.
