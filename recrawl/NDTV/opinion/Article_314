Headline::::Why We Cannot Ignore Pakistan



DateTime::::2014-12-19T15:33:00+05:30




                                (Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the 
Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, 
the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human 
Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has 
written 14 books, including, most recently, Pax Indica: India and the 
World of the 21st Century.) The horror in Peshawar this week has left us all in shock and distress. No Indian I know has failed to feel the pain of the Pakistani parents who sent their children to school in uniforms and got them back in coffins. Our country, starting with the Prime Minister, stood in solidarity with our grieving neighbours. "#IndiaWithPakistan" started trending on Twitter. Then the Lakhvi outrage shook our solidarity, when a so-called anti-Terrorism Court, after a travesty of a trial, granted bail to the principal plotter of 26/11. The announcement by the Pakistani government that they will appeal the decision, and that till then Lakhvi will remain behind bars, gives us some measure of relief. Where do we go from here? If the unspeakable tragedy in Peshawar  leads to Pakistan acting to cauterize the festering sores of terrorism their own ISI has incubated, and they see that India is not their real enemy but the extremism they fanned is, there is hope that peace can emerge from this carnage. One of the problems in the India-Pakistan relationship is that it is the last one left with sharply opposed binaries. The two sets of ideas in India for dealing with Pakistan involve a choice between those advocating a military attack on the sources of terrorism, and "peace at any price."  Our leaders are either exchanging sentimental letters about their mothers or ignoring each other in a stagnant silence. Too much of Indian public opinion is divided into sharply polarized camps of hawks and doves - the former insisting on nothing less than implacable hostility towards Islamabad, the latter advocating talks with whoever is in office in Islamabad, through a process "uninterruptable" even if new terrorist strikes emanating from Pakistan were to occur.  Neither position, in my view, is tenable. Hostility is a mood, not a policy, and hostility in perpetuity is neither viable nor desirable between neighbours. And while the doves may be right that New Delhi's visceral reaction to the terror attacks is tantamount to giving the terrorists a veto over our foreign policy choices, no democratic government can allow its citizens to be killed and maimed by forces from across the border, without reacting in some tangible way that conveys to Pakistan that there is a price to be paid for allowing such things to happen. At the same time, bombing the terrorist training camps at places like Muridke, as the hotheads advocate, can only prove counterproductive, cementing the popular hostility we are seeking to eliminate. What, then, is the way forward for India? It is clear that we want peace more than Pakistan does, because we have more at stake when peace is violated. To those who suggest that we should simply ignore our dysfunctional neighbours, accept the occasional terrorist blast (and prevent the ones we can), tell ourselves there is nothing we need from Pakistan and try to get on with our development free of the incubus of that benighted land, there is only one answer: we cannot grow and prosper without peace, and that is the one thing Pakistan can give us that we cannot do without. We cannot choose to be uninterested in Pakistan, because Pakistan is dangerously interested in us.  By denying us the peace we crave, Pakistan can undermine our vital national interests, above all that of our own development. Investors shun war zones; traders are wary of markets that might explode at any time; tourists do not travel to hotels that might be commandeered by crazed terrorists. These are all serious hazards for a country seeking to grow and flourish in a globalizing world economy.  Even if Pakistan cannot do us much good, it can do us immense harm, and we must recognize this in formulating our policy approaches to it. Foreign policy cannot be built on a sense of betrayal any more than it can be on illusions of love. Pragmatism dictates that we work for peace with Pakistan precisely so that we can serve our own people's needs better. But we must do this without illusions, without deceiving ourselves about the existence of genuine partners for peace across the border, and without being taken in by the insincere press releases of the civilian rulers who are occasionally allowed to don the masks of power in Pakistan.  We must accept that the very nature of the Pakistani state condemns us to facing an implacable enemy in the self-perpetuating military elite next door, for lasting peace would leave them without a raison d'etre for their power and their privileges.   In my own view, it is time for a different approach: one that separates the issue of political dialogue from that of trade and people-to-people contact. Yes, punish each incident of violence by freezing official talks: let the Pakistanis understand that if they want to talk to us officially, they have to take credible steps to rein in Lashkar-e-Toiba and Hafiz Sayeed, and they have to punish the 26/11 killers whose trial has so far been a travesty.  At the same time, we should open our doors and hearts to Pakistanis who have nothing to do with the military establishment. India can build on the generosity it has often shown - as witness the unilateral most-favoured nation status it gave Pakistan in 1996 - by extending itself to its neighbour, offering a market for Pakistani traders and industrialists, a creative umbrella to its artists and singers, an enthusiastic market for its fashion designers, and a home away from home for those seeking a refuge from the realities of Pakistani life. Multiplying our channels of contact away from Track-I and Track-II to embrace the ordinary people of Pakistan would put both countries back on the right track - towards genuine peace. Sadly India has reacted to 26/11 and other Pakistani provocations by punishing the wrong people -- tightening visa restrictions and restraining other possibilities of cultural and social contact. The terrorists of 26/11 did not apply for Indian visas before coming onshore with their deadly baggage. Those who apply are genuinely people of goodwill towards, and interest in, India.  The advantages of openly issuing visas and enhancing opportunities for Pakistanis in India outweigh the dangers; after all, almost every Pakistani visitor here is entranced by the land that Partition has denied to them. I am strongly in favour of a liberal visa regime, which would require India to remove its current restrictions on which points of entry and exit the Pakistani visa-holder can use, the number of places that may be visited, and the onerous police reporting requirements. To begin with, a list can be drawn up of prominent Pakistanis in such fields as business, entertainment and media, who would be eligible for more rapid processing and for five-year multiple-entry visas.  It will be argued that Pakistan will not reciprocate such one-sided generosity, but India should not care. Insisting on parity with Pakistan is to bring ourselves down to their level. Let us show a magnanimity and generosity of spirit that in itself stands an outside chance of persuading Pakistanis to rethink their attitude to us. Accepting Pakistan the way it is but pushing for peace nonetheless is, in my view, the only way forward. It will mean isolating those elements and those issues that both sides consider intractable, and placing them on the back burner for now, in order to proceed with those that can be solved. Trust and understanding can be built on the basis of Insaniyat -- welcoming non-official Pakistanis -- thereby improving the atmosphere within which the more difficult problems can be tackled.Standing still gets us nowhere. It is time to move forward with Pakistan.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the

                            Talking with pakistan will lead to no benefits, everytime in history when we reached out to them for peace, they replied with war (or proxy war). Bus to Delhi-Lahore wsa replied with Kargil, Serving biryani with beheading our Jawans, During PM role taking up, they were killing innocent civilians across the border. Never ever give any importance to Pakistan. If we reach out to them, they will think we are scared of them. Also, it is Pak Army controlling Pakistan/Terrorism not their political class.

                            Pakistan is a nation that was carved out of India in 1947 for India's Muslims, thank God for that, we don't need any relationships with that terror breeding nation as no one would like to revoke the healed wounds.

Mr Tharoor you are living in Lala land come out of it. They are bunch of snakes who eat their young which was displayed on their TV in the last 36 hours spraying hatred and blaming India for Peshawar's school attack. We have to ignore Pakistan like a bad habit, civil society as well as people to people contact for out betterment of the society. They are a lost cause! The dangerous part is United States giving aid to Pakistan and keeping the snakes alive! USA will not learn its lessons at least India did...

                            I think Shashi with a mix of pragmatism and national interest is a best choice for Foreign Affairs. His thoughtful comments are worth evaluating by those in Govt, coz none of the other choices are tenable in long term.

If this continues, I shall not come to this site anymore. Till we get justice for the victims of the Mumbai blasts, we shall not entertain such thoughts. This article suggests something which would leave the relatives of the victims of 26/11 feeling cheated &amp; dishonoured. Plse publish my comments.

                            Mr. Shashi, <br/>
I understand you want peace between India &amp; Pakistan!<br/>
But the proposal of easing Visa Rules is utter foolishness! <br/>
Visa is made easy between 2 friendly nations! <br/>
Such kind acts India have been doing for last 67 years!<br/>
What did we get? In the 67 years how many times Pakistan attacked in India? How many innocent Indians lost their life?<br/>
You are asking Indians to forget the martyrs of Mumbai &amp; shake hand with their killers &amp; give them Visa so that they dont need to come on a boat! :)<br/>
The problem with congress is at doesn't accept its failures!<br/>
Creation of Pakistan itself is Congress failure!<br/>
Congress couldn't do anything when Britishers used AIML to create Pakistan with the help of their SIRs(India's traitors) SIR Iqbal, SIR Syed, Jinnah business partner of a SIR!<br/>
In order to hide your failure, you guys always want people to forget whatever Pakistan does! Shame on you Mr.! Pakistan is a country built on lies or the liars by the liars! Remember Your ancestor who forgave Ghori 16 times, what he got? Your fate will be no different, you follow his foot steps!

Since childhood they were thought that non muslim n India is the enemy n we should kill them. They could not develop their economy, social system but to divert the mind of people their politicians are blaming India. They became popular wham the throw venoms to India n talking about Kashmir. That is the only business they have. So with whom we should talk.

is it too much to as to be realistic and call that country as enemy.<br/>
There could be some good people. But the fact is that the their voice is too low.<br/>

                            We cannot ignore pakistan, it is our neighbour and can cause plenty of harm if not handled tactfully. However the real danger is the Muslims who are in India and still admire pakistan. The basic problem here is they become the easy targets of the terrorist organization. The need of the hour is to bring these Muslims out of poverty by giving them proper education and providing employment opportunities. We have to accept the fact that the majority of Muslim population in this country is maintaining poor living standards and our caste/cultural system is responsible for this to a certain extent. Every Hindu should realize that the Muslim living next door is not a descendent of Mughal who invaded India but just another human being like he himself. The same applies to Muslims to consider India as their own country which is fulfilling his daily needs.

                            Very well said Mr. Tharoor.<br/>
This indeed is the only available option.<br/>
Bear in mind that money does play a role which is hard to foresee.<br/>
Take the case of China's wealth vis-a-vis Japan and USA.<br/>
The Pakistani businessman who makes money trading with India may have more levers to pull than a diplomat and would eventually push for conditions that perpetuate his profit making enterprise.

                            The piece suggests that a distinction can be made between moderates and extremists, but what if the moderates are the masks for the extremists? There could be any number of David Coleman Headleys. <br/><br/>
Let us firmly remember, never to forget that Pakistan is a predatory and parasitic society, it cannot sustain itself without becoming a client state, of some regional or global power. Since it remains a client state of hostile powers who use it to stir trouble for India, no amount of pacifism or pragmatism can control them. To control Pakistan will actually require their complete disintegration or bankrolling their elite. <br/><br/>
One has only to see their amazing capacity to mulct the hapless Americans, to realize just how good they are at this game. India has neither the money nor the heft to do this. <br/><br/>
The obvious option is to weaken and eventually destroy this state through non violent means, is by creating a very powerful counter-narrative through economic and social success, so that Pakistan can be reduced to irrelevance. <br/><br/>
This is precisely where the nincompoop UPA Government failed and lost us a decade. <br/><br/>
If Mr Tharoor is so desperate he should better advise his party stalwarts to support every measure to strengthen India economically, unfortunately, he and  his compatriots trumpet their irrelevance every day by mouthing inanities and recycled slogans.

                            Shashi Tharoor's article is an object lesson to all those in India trying to display their machismo in a mistaken notion and eager to convert India into a Pakistan. All of them need to be reminded of the USA's failed war in Vietnam, which is much smaller than Pakistan. The need for India and Pakistan to exist in an atmosphere of mutual trust and without any fear or angst of each other is of greater importance today than any other time in their history. Yes, both India and Pakistan must co-exist in great national honour and in mutual co-operation.

                            I agree with Tharoor ... we cannot ignore a heap of filth lying just next to us.  There is no such thing as a vegetarian snake.  There is no such person as a good intentioned Pakistani, when it comes to policitical connections with India.  On a personal level, Pakis are very affectionate with Indians when the two meet in a foreign setting like US or UK but these are the ones who do not want to be Pakis no more.  Dialog has to continue but in the right way. And the right way with Pakistan is not the norms or standards of international diplomacy, but a policy of filth-handling.  So Pakistani delegations should be allowed but special units need to engage them.  And multiple entry visas to those scumbags - is Tharoor nuts?

                            It is a middle path that will work - Stick and Slap; which one first? Obviously you reprimand first and then rehabilitate. Need to gather them under a strong arm of law and the use psychological tactics of guiding them what is the result of terrorism. This requires a global approach that UN should adapt of taming rogue nations. There is no other way. We have tried peaceful approach in the past. Force will align multiple nations supporting various causes. But then you can't contain them without applying force first.

                            As an Indian Muslim who is currently serving in the armed forces, I feel extreme pain that these perpetual acts of terror are continuously instigated by Muslims of mostly non-Indian origin.  I stand by my Indian brothers and sisters in condemning each and every attack on Indian soil, and I promise to lay my life, if required, in defending fellow Indians, be it Hindu, Muslim, or Christian.<br/><br/>
I request all Indians to not alienate Indian Muslims and support us, just like Australians supported their Muslims.  We're as much Indian as you or anyone else of Indian origin.  We felt equally ecstatic when Tendulkar bombarded Shoaib Akhtar in the 2003 World Cup, and we cry our hearts out when a certain coward nation touches my motherland, which is and will always be Bharat.

                            The very existance and social relevance of Pakistan would crumble if Pakistan chooses to eliminate the Terrorists "Good" or "Bad". The Frankenstein they nurtured as a result of contradicting ideology has started hunting down its creators. Its India's impotency, mainly politically that has failed to put a check on Pakistan not to disturb its eastern borders. Political parties have gone soft on Pakistan so as not to disturb certain vote banks garnered with faulty ideologies to remain seated in Power. Some things never change. The mistakes Maharaja of Ujjain Raja Jaichand did, still gets repeated - but in different form and shape. Issues with Pakistan is not about a piece of land or Border, its about dominance, ideologies and subjucation that has witnessed time and again.

                            As long as you treat Pakistan as a civilized state, it will continue to indulge in terrorism. Western countries tolerate Pakistan for their own selfish reasons and partly due to having used Jihad to fight Russians. They supported racism of South Africa for years. India should face the reality that Pakistan is a terrorist state. Being open to talk only would mean playing with terror tap. The very fact that bail was given to Lakhvi demonstrated clear intent to continue terrorism.

                            Very sensible set of suggestions: "Keep talking to the people of Pakistan, but punish the Government of Pakistan whenever necessary".<br/><br/>
You can't just ignore that festering sore of a nation. You can either fix it or annihilate it. Since the latter is not possible, we have to keep working on the former.<br/><br/>
And while we're at it, let's also learn some lessons from that sorry nation. The key one is that a 'Hindu nation' (which so many of our citizens seem to want, starting from the central government downwards) is destined to go the same way as a an 'Islamic nation'. Like Hilary Clinton said, you breed snakes in your backyard and they bite you some day. Pakistan's Islamic snakes are biting back, and India's Hindu snakes are going to the same, one day.

                            Snakes are dangerous and slithery creatures and are abound in nature. They can do us no good and can cause immense harm. So what do we do with them. We step out of the way and erect walls and protections and put them in museums. Let us do the same with Pakistanis.Let us step out of the way, erect barriers, shoot them down if they try to slither into our country and put them in museums(prisons) when we find them. I don't have and I hope most of my country men don't have one millimeter of commonality with any of Pakistanis until they grow into 'humanity'. <br/><br/>

So long as US was talking peace, USSR was provocative.<br/>
But Reagan ended that era, and took a hard stand against USSR, which brought them to their knees.<br/><br/>
THe author is correct, we need to do something new.<br/>

Even the recent incident of deadly Peshawar school terror attack. whats their reaction for India? We can see that many people from Pakistan feel very positive and want strong relation with India but they have no voice as their Political party &amp; Military want to support terrorist against India. So we have to consider other way to deal with Pakistan. and some time Silent make more impact then words!!!!

                            Thank you for your sympathies for the believed families. However no one individual in India can grasp the total picture of the history of Indo Pak conflict since 1947......Would you like to comment on the 100,000 Mukhti Bahini terrorists that were infiltrated by India into the then east Pakistan in 1971 or the more recent and still going on Indian support to Taliban extremists hiding in Afghanistan and attacking Pakistan. No one says the Indians planned this attack but your RAW does provide material and intelligence and financial support to Mullah Fazlullah who is the leader of the Taliban and hiding in Afghanistan. It is his people and he himself who planned this school massacre........You are a simple politician, you may not know what RAW is doing but do try to investigate this aspect in order to learn the truth.

                            Lakhvi got arrested Again ! A small court bailed him just because "Lack of evidence" Courts in Pakistan don't have to ask permission before taking any decision. As Govt, Army &amp; judiciary are three different institutions.<br/>
Indian media is injecting poison in the mind of 1.25 billion against Pakistan.<br/><br/>
Pakistan and  its Arm forces and the dozens of intelligence institutions including "ISI" &amp; Govt of Pakistan are not mad that they always tried to bring both countries on the bring of full scale/ medium scale war.<br/><br/>
More than 200,000 troops of Pak Arm forces are fighting a medium scale war with terrorists on Afghan border (Mostly funded &amp; supported by Indian RAW using Afghan soil) Pakistan has already moved its 100,000 troops from Indian border to Afghan border to fights against terrorism.<br/>
Pakistan can't afford eastern border fight while they are busy western border (Pak Afghan border )

                            All the things Shashi said, India has been doing since decades. we gave the MFN state in 1996, nearly 2 decades ago and our sickulars like Bhat etc have been giving opportunities to their artists and our sport heros like Sania even married one of their guy. So from 1990s to till now did India get any benifit and did we get peace .? Before 1990s pak attacked us directly  but later has been attacking us indirectly. You can not have peace with a nation which is born out of hatred towards India. more than 80% of India wants peace with pak and believe in live and let live where as more than 80% of pak wants to destroy or change India into another country. The only way is India becoming stronger and stronger and teach a lesson to Pak and also help the regions like Baluchistan and make the enemy so weak that he never thinks of harming India again.

                            All the comments that I see here are from simple-minded, myopic people who have failed to see the bigger picture even when put so eloquently and moderately by Mr Shashi Tharoor. Just because his words are not spewing venom does not mean that they are not guided by the purest form of self interest for India. At least try, for once, to rise above the emotion that is clouding your minds and think with the cold hearted logic that you can muster within your minds, if any. Seriously... how stupid can some people get, telling him to go live in Pakistan.

1. I must begin by complimenting you on a well thought out &amp; written article. <br/>
2. However, another thought process is that any democratically elected government; even in a partially failed state such as Pakistan has to now to public pressure &amp; sentiments. <br/>
3. Pakistan has followed a policy of state sponsored terrorism &amp; will continue with this policy till it is forced to otherwise by both external (foreign pressure) &amp; internal (adverse domestic public opinion) forces.<br/>
4. Hence, a need for us as a nation to react strongly &amp; show consistency in this aspect of our foreign policy. Strength respects strength; and will show no respect for weakness or perceived weakness (even if in reality it is actually strength of national character..... because it is perceived as a weakness.<br/>

                            The fact is none of us know how to deal with Pakistan.  I am pretty sure our neighbors perceive us the same way. Anyway no person responsible for National security will agree to a liberal visa regime with Pakistan. Can Mr. Tharoor give any example of two hostile neighbors who had liberal visa regime.  I am not sure there exists any. The fact is most of us Indians believe that Pakistan is responsible for almost all the terrorism in Pakistan and India.  We believe the support for this comes from establishment in Pakistan.  Unless Pakistan does something to address this perception, nothing is going to change in our relationship.

                            A very valid suggestion to isolate people to people issues from the political ones. No matter how good or bad the neighbour is we have to eventually come to terms with each other for the sake of peace and tranquility. People pressure invariably impinges on political decisions. Either take the military route and accept short term losses, no matter how heavy or carve out a fresh approach to change the situation. It must no longer be business as usual.

                            To those that feel India should not or cannot have anything to do with Pakistan, need to accept that we, for better of worse, are neighbours, and each cannot ignore the other. It's just not practical. For those that feel it just won't work, need to look at the history of other neighbouring nations that 50 years ago, were bitter enemies, and today have free flow of trade and people. Only one thing did it. Commerce. Once two nations have a intermingling of trade and commerce, fighting becomes improbable. When two nation's economies become inter-dependant, even the thought of war is unimaginable. This is something we have seen again and again in history. Check it out.

                            Personally I think Mr Tharoor has a point, which is more easier said than done, I may add. Most Pakistanis have an unfounded hate of India where as there are also those modern citizens and even political parties who are more worried about unemployment, poverty, violence, education, electricity, issues very common in our country though better by a significant scale. It is these voices that Mr Tharoor feels need to be heard and invited through indirect engagement. Fostering trade is definitely a method of engagement and even better, give Pakistan FDI in businesses all along the line of control, then it would be interesting to see how much firing and shelling occurs from their side. Jokes aside, it's a serious and complicated matter which we should deal maturely as a global leader. And also guys, you can choose not to like Mr Tharoor, but he is an elected MP and we can afford a little more respect in our comments, that too to an internationally respected figure. He is not Mani!!

We should focus more on fighting against terrorism by helping Pakistan whatever they need. Forget about religion and fight for humanity and save future of our coming generations.

                            Two sets of ideas floating in India's mind to deal with Pakistan are the two extreme ends of a pole.One set advocates a military attack on sources of terrorism in Pakistan.In military terms it is called surgical attacks,but this step would hardly be feasible,since time and again Pakistan has warned India that any attack on any part of Pakistan would be considered an attack on attack on Pakistan as a whole.This could trigger a full fledged war between the two countries which either of the country can hardly afford at the moment.The only option is struggle for peace.This path can be pursued with sincerity from both Sides to achieve a permanent peace in sub continent  so that the two countries could mobilise their resources and open a joint front against common enemy.. that  is terrorism...
