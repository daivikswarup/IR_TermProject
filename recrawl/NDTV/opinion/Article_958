Headline::::In Delhi Raid, Many CBI Bloopers And Not For The First Time



DateTime::::2015-12-18T14:55:00+05:30




                                When Central Bureau of Investigation officers were bumbling their way through the Delhi Secretariat, trying to find something against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Principal Secretary, Rajender Kumar on Tuesday, even those who have been closely associated with the agency couldn't believe what they were seeing.
"I cannot believe that such a top officer is being raided without informing his boss," said a former CBI director, adding, "He is a UT cadre officer which is directly controlled by the Central government, surely they must have been told?''
There is enough in the CBI manual to prove his point but let's just look at a couple of instances from the agency's past. There isn't a dearth of bloopers, as anyone who has tracked the CBI will tell you. One of the more recent ones is from March 2013, just about a day after the DMK pulled out of the UPA alliance.
CBI investigators are all early risers; so on that day at 7 am, a team from their Chennai branch landed up at the house of MK Stalin, DMK chief M Karunanidhi's son and political heir, to assess the cars he owned. Parked in his driveway was a Hummer that his film producer son, Udhayanadhi bought in 2007, and apparently, had missed paying duty on.
So along with the Department of Revenue Intelligence, the CBI decided to raid 40 other locations in and around Chennai.
This was months before the Supreme Court famously called the agency "a caged parrot", but it was difficult not to link the raid with the bitter split the DMK had with the Centre just a day before. Angry DMK workers shouted at the CBI team conducting raids, but it wasn't their slogans which made them retreat. It was public statements from Central ministers.
"I am dismayed," said then Finance Minister and Tamil Nadu lawmaker P Chidambaram who asked his colleague and then minister in-charge of the CBI, Narayanasamy to conduct an inquiry.
Another minister, Kamal Nath also condemned the CBI's enthusiasm and soon, the CBI detectives went back to their offices. Days later, CBI bosses in Delhi explained how their local officer didn't connect the dots and failed to get the timing of the raid right. How it was okayed by bosses in Delhi and whether it was possible to have missed Stalin's name in the list of those being raided, went unanswered.
But then, the CBI doesn't care to answer all questions. Which is why, they have been caught in a losing game of perception and public relations against the Aam Aadmi Party.
Never before has any raided party given real time updates to the media the way Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal provided this week. Never before has the raided party released copies of documents the CBI picked up.
So, while everyone chuckled when the CBI raided A Raja's office three years after he scripted the 2G scam, it is only the Aam Aadmi Party which has called out the ridiculousness of the CBI raiding an officer, eight years after he allegedly committed a crime and far away from the so-called "crime scene''.
AAP's constant challenging forced a radical change in the CBI. They gave two public soundbytes in two days, a frequency unheard of in an agency which hides public documents like First Information Reports. But the more they speak, the more they reveal. After all, it takes some special imagination to tell the press that you have "unearthed" Rs. 28 lakh in the bank accounts of an IAS officer.
Unable as yet to show anything concrete against Rajender Kumar, the CBI continues to grill him all day long, telling reporters that they will present all their "evidence'' in court. They also claim they were right in law when they didn't tell Kejriwal that they were raiding and booking his aide. Totally forgetting to mention that their manual also says that they should take bosses into confidence.
That's what the agency itself did when they arrested Judge Shamit Mukherjee for corruption, a few years ago. Even though the arrest was not in the courtroom, they informed the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court. Why? "Because it was the right thing to do," said the officer in charge.
The right thing to do has always been inconsistent for a closed agency like the CBI. No wonder that reporters covering the beat told the CBI press officer on Wednesday evening, "Do you know a parrot which was flying over the building suddenly dropped dead?"(Sunetra Choudhury is Editor, National Affairs, NDTV 24x7)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            we know how CBI used to work earlier. let them raid now, whats wrong? ther is no requirement to inform boss for raid. if rajender is so uncorrupt, why just they cant allow CBI to raid and prve that they are not corrupt. if u do ur work its problem, if u don't do ur work, its a problem.

                            "Unable as yet to show anything concrete against Rajender Kumar, the CBI continues to grill him all day long, telling reporters that they will present all their "evidence'' in court."<br/><br/>
How does anyone know, other than those investigating, what evidence they have? And because we don't know it, would be unwise to jump to conclusions about whether they have anything concrete or not. To whom should the evidence be presented, if not to the courts? Surely not the media or public. <br/><br/>
"They also claim they were right in law when they didn't tell Kejriwal that they were raiding and booking his aide."<br/><br/>
Its not a claim, it is the law. There is a court order to back them, that they need not inform anyone. Where does the author get this information about informing bosses? It may have been there earlier but after the court ruling, has made it redundant. One would expect relatively experienced media people to know such basic facts.<br/><br/>
Its easy to bash investigative agencies and govt servants. They are not permitted to respond. Canon fodder for those who wish to criticise.

                            Why was Arvind protecting and working with a corrupt officer???? Even his guru Anna Hazare made this point.<br/>
Why didn't he do background checks. He political capital is anti-corruption. Yet, AAP is the only government where within a year so many party people have been clearly indicted of frauds and misdemeanors !! Confrontational attitude and anarchic tendencies doesn't help in India for long. There was widespread anger against UPA-II and this was cashed in by both AAP in Delhi and BJP in India. Even PM Modi realizes it by now. Ordinary Indians want politicians to debate, discuss and dissent to build up public support for respective parties over 5 years, whether you are in opposition or if you are in government. <br/>
AAP has the bad habit of filing wild baseless allegations against anyone.

Earlier this year Rajasthan CM's office was also raided without informing CM Raje for the similar corruption charges on a senior bureaucrat who was working in CM's office and at that time these so called anti corruption crusaders didn't raise questions and cry foul???

                            Clearly  Sunethra is batting for AAP now!!! Whether CBI raid was conducted in a shoddy manner or not , it is only  a reflection of the lack of professionalism of the officers on duty on that day, Why is she not talking anything about Kejariwal's accusation that the raid is linked to the proposed DDCA enquiry? CBI did not take any files relating to that. Nothing stops  Kejariwal from continuing the enquiry after the raid ????? If Kejariwal chooses not to investigate it after the raid it only means that there was no such enquiry and he is just throwing some dirt at a person in power to cover his actions!!  Nothing about this from the author but she knows precise details of the bank balance of the IAS officer and the exact time  many years ago of the crime committed by him. If this is not a biased article, what is????

Without evidence, it will be insult to CBI which is supposed to be beyond Govt control. Calling Modi in personal terms with offensive words like Psychopath only indicates the kind of professionalism AK is demonstrating. He made allegations on everyone he doesnt like. Incidentally the number of Non-BJP people is quite less. Can we the people have a right to believe that AK has an agenda?  For him, Rahul,Sonia, Shiela Dixit, Chidambaram, Lalu, Mulayam are all honest while anyone under Modi and Modi himself are corrupt, power hungry and psychopaths.

                            Excellent article.  <br/>
So for Big Joke party the corruption part is exposed but why to worry,  all the scams done by bjp are not even considered for a fair trial so treat this event just like another normal day. Delhi govts DDCA scam report will be declared null and void and in any case bjp will continue attacking AAP with help of DP and cbi.  <br/>
So basically what ever AAP does is bad politics but these parties who've made the ultimate mess since independence are now cows best friend.

                            I am appalled at the news sites, articles, headlines, views of the so called Intelligentsia of this country. It is all about hatred, jealousy, negative, narrow minded ness and the relentless efforts to malign each other, abuse each other with extreme positions with no value about what is in country's interest and what are our problems with possible solutions. The news channels are vociferously claiming we are breaking the news first for every issues which is trivial, makes no sense for the country except to sensationalize something to hog headlines. I am not saying some party is right or another party is wrong or getting into the BJP Vs Congress Vs AAP feuds or wars witnessed these days. All that I am saying is whether the media is helping the situation or making things worse ? I am another hopeless citizen who tried electing the right leaders only to find they fighting like dogs in the Parliament, Assembly and Media using the tamasha to increase TRPs. Where are we heading as a NATION ???
