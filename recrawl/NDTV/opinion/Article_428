Headline::::In Defense of Rahul Gandhi's Sabbatical



DateTime::::2015-02-24T14:05:00+05:30



(Pawan Khera is a political analyst with the Congress party.)
	Rahul Gandhi's decision to go on a sabbatical to introspect came as a shock to political observers. An immediate interpretation about his lack of interest in politics was made. Observers who not so long ago gleefully used the so-called Jayanthi bombshell to blame him for 'interfering' in the functioning of the UPA government are now labeling him as a reluctant politician. It is the tragedy of our times that we are so used to leaders who are desperate to come to power that if someone does not show that desperation, he or she is dismissed as disinterested in politics. Apart from desiring and acquiring power, there is also something called deserving power. If someone chooses to ignore the hackneyed trajectory of his bloodline, and attempts instead to deserve his place, there is certainly much more in him than just the bloodline.
	Losing elections is as common to political parties as winning them. The post-defeat 'chinta-chintan' culture does little to either diagnose the problem or prescribe the cure, as sycophancy and survival become the underlying instincts of doctors, compounders and quacks of a political party.
	There comes a time in the life of every individual and organization when difficult but fundamental questions need to be answered. The Congress party is going through the worst electoral reversals. A transition, not just from the old to the young, but a transition of ideas is underway at several levels in every political party. Narendra Modi found the transition easy by creating a dysfunctional 'Marg Darshak Mandal' (panel of advisors) and relegating an entire generation of senior leadership to it. It helped that he won the elections and has a big brother in the RSS to tame voices of dissent.
	The Congress has a different dilemma. Rahul Gandhi is being seen as the next president of a party whose systems he has been struggling to set right. A defeat of this magnitude is bound to evoke existential angst. Where are we going wrong? Do we need to revisit our fundamentals? There are conflicting answers. When the party lost the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it was said that the rights-based pro-poor policies cost us dear. Nine months later, the Aam Aadmi Party rides the dole bandwagon to win the Delhi elections with an unprecedented majority, demolishing both the argument of 2014 and those who used the argument to win 2014.
	Commentator after commentator convincingly accused the Congress leadership of remote-controlling the Manmohan Singh government. As if it is a crime for the party to monitor the implementation of the very promises which it had made during elections and which brought it to power. The National Advisory Council (NAC) was labeled an extra-constitutional body that imposed its agenda on the elected government   as if the NAC agenda was anti-people or in contradiction with the party's manifesto. As if the RSS, whose office-bearers sit with the Education Minister to decide the menu of IIT canteens, is an elected body helping the government implement the BJP's manifesto. The Congress was punished, they say, because it did not act on charges of corruption. As if removing a Chief Minister and two cabinet ministers, even without their guilt having been proved was ever done by any other government in the past.
	To be able to comprehend the macro, it is important to step away from the micro for a while. Managers, and not leaders, grapple with the here and now. A leader has to pause and reflect to deconstruct the discourse and decide if there is a need for course correction. The timing of Rahul Gandhi's decision to take a break from party work is being questioned on the following grounds:
	a) The budget session of Parliament will attempt to pass the Land Acquisition Ordinance which dilutes the pro-farmer Act.
	b) Anna Hazare is sitting on a dharna to oppose this dilution of the Act envisaged and pushed by the NAC and Rahul Gandhi under the UPA government.
	The Congress Parliamentary Party has able heads to scuttle any attempt by the government to secure the passage of the Ordinance. Anna Hazare, who chose to remain silent when the UPA was struggling to pass the very Act which he is now protesting to protect, does not want Rahul Gandhi to join him in the protest, but does not mind sharing the dais with Arvind Kejriwal.
	What Rahul Gandhi is grappling with is far more fundamental and crucial. He is being expected to take charge of the party at a time when the very idea of Congress and all that it stands for faces a question mark. He must comprehend the questions and find answers. And it can only be done by stepping away from blinding spotlights and deafening cacophony.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            It might suit Mr Rahul Gandhi - to step away from the blinding glare and deafening cacophany for good Mr Khera - bcoz Mr Khera in your blind defence of Mr Gandhi and his virtues as a leader - you forgot this - that leaders embrace difficult times its the managers and the foot soldiers that run away - you sycophant - blind leading the deaf and blind -you deserve no better than this piece of advice and maybe Mr Gandhi can contemplate this from boudoir - maybe Mother Teresa would have given you that advice if she actually did care - Rest in Peace

                            What else can he say. You can provide all the justifications you like, people instinctively understand that Rahul Gandhi is not a leader. Just like Kapil Sibal came up with his complicated zero loss theory - people instinctively knew he was trying to cover up and that money had been stolen. Ask Rahul to please stay in Bangkok. No need to return. Let him have fun. I'm sure he has not shortage of money, so no need to worry about earning a living like the rest of us.

                            Why not VRS instead? Or a Consultant role of authority without accountability, which will anyway suit him?

                            In the interest of everyone Rahul should retire from politics once and for all.  He is not cut out for it. As simple as that. Congress should go for energetic and involved leaders like Sachin Pilot, Jairam Ramesh and Nandan Nilekeni.  Enough of Gandhis. Time to look far beyond.

                            Going on sabbatical right in the middle of Lok sabha sessions. Shame on Junta who chose him to represent them in parliament when the Shehzada is busy in vacationing. Did anyone question the time of these vacations? Is this the democracy you guys keep on shouting? an entire constituency chose him to represent them, not to shy away from his responsibilities as MP. The sabbatical could have been taken at any other time but for when parliament is in session. Too ashamed of visiting parliament with 43 odd folks i guess. Dear Mr Author, Constitution is mightier than individual parties and their welfare.

                            The Congress Party has got adrift of its ideological moorings. It is part of the `extreme centre' emerging in Indian politics which essentially endorses the neo liberal economic agenda and serves the corporate interest in the main.This must change. The Congress will have to firmly claim its left of centre position.
