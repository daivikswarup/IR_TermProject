Headline::::As Team Kejriwal, We Accept These 10 Challenges



DateTime::::2015-02-16T10:18:00+05:30



(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)
	We in AAP can easily claim that the toughest days are behind us .
	Wrong. Rather, the difficult days have begun. The challenges ahead are more enormous than ever before. When aspirations are sky-high, the possibility of going downhill is equally strong. 67 is an extraordinary number. This is a number of hopes. This is a number of dreams. This is a number which assures people of Delhi in particular and India at large that that finally their dreams will be fulfilled, corruption will be defeated and a new political system will take shape. For that, the AAP government has to refocus its energy, reorient its strategy and reorganize its long-term goals. In my opinion, the AAP government faces these ten challenges.
	1.  To create a model of alternate politics. It may be easy to govern and easier to administer, but the 67 seats the people of Delhi has given us because they believe the old model of governance will go and a new one will surface. As the old saying goes, success has a self-destructive logic. The existing political system was created when India got its independence and it was made a republic. It has been more than six decades - rot has set in.  The Establishment has developed vested interests and together, they are corroding the system. AAP has to deliver a new framework for governance, and if it succeeds, it will be a natural claimant for the national alternative in near future.
	2.  AAP has to redefine Indian democracy which currently suffers from a top-down approach when it should be the other way around.   Arvind Kejriwal has emerged from the grassroots. He was not thrust upon the party from the top. His idioms and phrases are different.  Arvind has not rested a day since the parliamentary debacle for AAP, but Rahul Gandhi has apparently reconciled to the fate that things will finally improve like they did for the Congress after 1977. "Wait for the right time" is the motto of Rahul Gandhi.  For the rest of us in AAP, the idea is to reach out all the time to the ultimate stake-holders, who are the voters. AAP has to continue its live connect with the masses, and this will be huge challenge for the party and government.
	3.  AAP has broken many myths in the past, it has to break a few in governance too. If AAP has to be true to its promise, it has to provide a clean government. And transparency is the first principle of clean government. Transparency has its own pitfalls which might create problems for the administration but for alternate politics, this is not a big price.
	4.  The ministers have to lead from the front. They will be constantly watched; minor mistakes will be hyped; the media will ruthlessly scrutinise them. AAP ministers can't compare themselves to the ministers of other parties as AAP has set a different standard for itself. So it can't claim to be judged by others' parameters.
	5.  The same rule applies to AAP MLAs too. They will be AAP's first contact with the people. They are the torch-bearers of the party. Their behaviour on the ground will decide the future of the party and their own fate in their constituencies. They should ensure they are just one ring away for any public service.
	6.  The government and the party both have to complement and compete with each other. The biggest mistake is made when the party surrenders to the might of the government. If AAP has to remodel politics, then the party should maintain its autonomy and if required, it should not desist from being critical of the government.
	7.  AAP has promised a participatory democracy. Decision-making and policy formulation in the government has to be more open.  The administration must be effective, and it has to be accountable.
	8.  AAP has devised a 70-point action plan. It should be its most fundamental guide to its future and governance.
	9.  AAP has decided to provide cheap water, education, power and free wi-fi which has given a handle against us to opponents?  They say AAP is going back to the old socialist world. We know that this is not true. AAP stands for a new market economy. But the basic needs of society have to be addressed. And a good mix of market and welfarism has to be evolved.
	10. Finally, even if there is turbulence, rough weather, AAP has to keep its cool. A smile will be a hundred times better than the smug silence that mainstream parties adopt when they encounter criticism.  We all have to be polite and humble in accepting our mistakes and assuring others that we are here not for confrontation but for cooperation. We are not the problem, but part of a solution.
	I believe that this is doable. Arvind in his inaugural speech has given us to believe that we all have to leave our ahankaar (egos) behind. The arrogance is the biggest minus which the government, the party, and an individual can annexe with the attainment of power.
	We are here to serve. We will give it our all. Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Great!!  I also do believe that Delhi give full mandate to AAP not for freebies but for the removal of corruption, transparency and clean government. Once this is done all will fall into place. We  Delhites are not cheap stars who vote for freebies. many of us took part in India Against Corruption, we feel AAP can deliver what we faught for. thats it.

                            I especially like the idea of AAP (the party) keeping AAP the govt. in check. An excellent idea which ensures that the govt. never takes its role lightly. They should remember that they are accountable and answerable to the public at all the time. Granted that Delhi is a small city-state. But may this be new beginning in Indian politics and governance.

                            Just yesterday you asked the PM to help you make electricity affordable in Delhi. A comparative study shows that power is cheaper in Delhi than in most other metros, so what exactly are you talking about. Secondly if you had clarified before that it takes the PM to help in making electricity cheaper, then people of Delhi would have voted for BJP. You have 67 seats in a house of 70. Do not fool around this time, people will not spare you.

Now you are ruling govt and you are willing to do, then what is the challange??? if it is challange then your allegations on the then govt were wrong!!<br/><br/>

                            Firstly, identify people from your party who feel they have become kings of Delhi after the election.  Dont give in to blackmail even from the same voters who have elected you.  Learn to do what is right and be righteous.  Suddenly during elections illegal jhuggis came up thinking that they will not be demolished.  These are surely done by anti social elements who have been promised security by the candidates.  This must be from AAP party itself.  Severely reprimand such candidates.<br/>
Also identify the ones who feel coming in power means a lottery ticket from self, family and friends.  If such things happen there is no difference between you'll and the other parties.<br/>
Also one more suggestion is that build up a base of AAP volunteers all over india like MAAP... ( Member of Aam Aadmi Party)  This will help you'll in future elections.<br/>
On your website open a section "Become a Member"<br/>
If you'll fail to deliver on your promises you'll will be wiped out from the face of india.

                            I think AAP can make an attempt ot a good shot on the target after carefully working out the actual governance model on the ground based on their blueprint...after all God helps those who help themselves  - if they work with a good attitude in the right direction then I am sure their model will work...there are a lot of economic models that are available to support free/cheap power, water, internet, etc and we all know about the works on welfare economics by an Indian nobel prize winner...so yeah I mean however free market economy you want to have in India you cannot stop the welfare politics as there are lot of poor people out there in the city...eventually someone has to pay for the free and cheap resources - so it has to come from the pockets of those who need to use the resources and public infrastructure more and also to make profits...the caveat is - there needs to be strong scrutiny so that people do not misuse the public welfare policies, a strong vigilance mechanism is needed !!

                            points well made ashutosh. keep it up, we r with u. remember modi had said the same thing (it's a vote of hope) in the first meeting of nda mps after winning parliamentary elections. i still hold the view that vote was not for bjp nor modi, it was for hope. similarly, 67 is not for our party (i give 40) nor kejriwal (another 10), but 67 is for hope. congress &amp; gandhi family represent hopelessness. at national level bjp/modi represent hope and wherever people have a strong alternative to cong &amp; bjp, they go whole-hog for it. that's my final analysis for our historic win.

                            Before election these people boasted that they achieved in 49 days what Congress and BJP could not achieve in 60 and 6 years.  True AAP has achieved the cunning nature of a wily politician within these 49 days.  On its first day in the second innings AAP is singing a different tone.  It wants PM to help them fulfil the promises they made to the common man.  It is he who made the promise should fulfil it.  Pulling fast ones will pull you also fast down.

                            Well said, Ashutosh! Whatever you have promised is fair. It is certainly attainable. Regarding the economic model for giving subsidies: India has been losing almost 90% of its revenues in corruption. If you stop this leakage, no additional source of funding is required. <br/><br/>
I am concerned that the Central government may work at cross-purposes with you. But ,we are all watching them. If they do, then they will begin to lose every other state as well. On the other hand, if you keep communicating with us the way that you are doing, you will only keep winning our respect in even greater measure.<br/><br/>
More wind to your sails! Lead on!

                            The vision, the plan and the philosophy of AAP is simply great. But people and media will take time to understand this kind of politics.

                            Notice that all 10 points from the author except for point 9 is GENERIC garbled MUMBO JUMBO with ZERO specifics.  Point 9 is a DEFENSIVE statement and an apology in advance!!  Let us examine critically the phrase 'A mix of "NEW MARKET ECONOMY" AND "WELFARISM"!!'  Market economy = demand &amp; supply determine the PRICE of goods &amp; services.  WELFARISM = SOCIALISM = "FREE or SUBSIDIZED stuff - meaning goods &amp; services provided at BELOW market determined price".<br/><br/>
So there is no such thing as mixing "MARKET ECONOMY &amp; WELFARISM" - they are like oil &amp; water.<br/><br/>
  Since NO Goods or Service is truly free the manufacturer/provider has no interest in selling it to AAP or its constituents.  So it must necessarily come from TAXES levied on the NON-WELFARE recipients of DELHI or other parts of the country (Central Government grants). It is called robbing Peter to pay Paul - In economics it is called "monopoly effect".  It necessarily causes the price of goods to deviate (higher or lower) from its true "free economy" price.

                            slab system should be introduced for fixing the power tariff. The price per unit should be based on  annual average usage. Those consuming less energy need to pay only half. Those using luxury equipment like AC or high voltage bulbs should be charged heavily. The extra money collected from the rich should be used for distributing LED bulbs at subsidized rates

                            Mr. Ashutosh,<br/><br/>
is it possible to provide  pure drinking water(not cheap dirty pollutred water as everybody knows which is being supplied now)  Before thinking of providing cheap free water, your party should apply its mind in cleaning the river Yamuna and proivde clean water at affordable cost.<br/><br/>
Again regarding free/subsidized power as gainst 24x7 power being enjoyed by citizens of Delhi, what if you cannot proivde 24x7 electricity as you have lured the voters with free/subsidized  <br/>
electriciy.  <br/><br/>
If i do not get a satisfacoty response from you or AAP, i will take up this issue in the electronic media
