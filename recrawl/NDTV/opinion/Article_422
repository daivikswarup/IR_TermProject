Headline::::Modi and Pawar. Natural, if Unofficial, Allies



DateTime::::2015-02-17T21:13:00+05:30



Mumbai:             
	(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer. She is working on a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi which will be published later this year.)
	Late in December, BJP party president Amit Shah who had led the party to victory in Maharashtra called on Sharad Pawar at a Mumbai hospital. Pawar, the chief of the Nationalist Congress Party or NCP, had injured himself at his Delhi residence and was flown to Mumbai for treatment; he is still recuperating in the financial capital.
	Many lauded Shah's gesture whose party, during the campaign for the state election, had scathingly referred to the NCP as a "Naturally Corrupt Party."But the volte-face not a major shock. When the BJP did not clear a majority in Maharashtra, and was in terse negotiations with preferred partner Shiv Sena, it was Pawar's party which offered unconditional support. So it was not surprising that Shah visited Pawar given the potential of a mutually beneficial relationship.
	The meeting had another motive. NCP heavyweight Ganesh Naik who left the Shiv Sena and joined Pawar in the 90s enjoys tremendous political influence in the Thane, Navi Mumbai belt, especially among mathadi kamgaar workers (unorganized labour) who form an important and chunky votebank. Naik who had served as Guardian Minister for Thane had remained  one of Pawar's most reliable men despite his alleged involvement  in illegal quarrying.
	The Maharashtra results which saw a huge surge in the popularity of the BJP had Naik concerned about his own prospects, and he reportedly  communicated to Pawar that he was keen on joining the BJP, not least because his men were on the verge of rebellion.
	Naik also skipped a very important meeting of NCP leaders in Mumbai in December . His absence would have meant further losses for the NCP in  municipal elections due in 2017 in the state.
	 Those elections are crucial for the BJP to cut the Sena down to size.  Though they are co-governing Maharashtra, the alliance is an onerous one, and the Sena repeatedly attacks the BJP in public.   
	Amit Shah has reportedly promised Pawar that the BJP will not add  Ganesh Naik as a member  for as long as the NCP helps combat the Sena in the municipal elections and helps important legislation move through the Maharashtra state assembly.
	It was also at December's hospital visit that Shah discussed the modalities of Modi's visit to Baramati, the Pawar family stronghold.
	In his speech at Baramati three days ago , Modi heaped praise on Pawar, calling him a politician whose help was needed in national interest and strategic affairs of the country "I speak to Sharad Pawar more than two times a month. Sharad Pawar has always thought of farmers' plight, " he said in a state where farmer suicides remain unabated.
	 
	The Shiv Sena, which has been keeping a close watch on the NCP- BJP love affair, is in the know of the agreement between the two parties, and has used every possible occasion in the last three months to take a dig at the Modi-Shah combo. The fusillade of criticism against the BJP has included taunts after its massive defeat to Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi and a verbal thrashing of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis over this week's shooting of CPI activist Gautam Pansare and his wife in Maharashtra.
	For the BJP, the Sena and the Akalis in Punjab are turning into problematic allies. So it makes sense to have Pawar firmly by its side. It's a quid pro quo for the two in the state with rumors emanating from the NCP that the party could join the Prime Minister's central government, should the need arise.
	 
	Irrespective of the numbers , Sharad Pawar, easily one of the most shrewd and astute old men in Indian politics, is a politician Modi would want to keep by his side, not just as an able negotiator during crises ( he was called the UPA's trouble shooter), but also as a counterpoint to the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra.
	The control of the sugar industry of Maharashtra  and the powerful cooperatives are evenly divided between the Congress, the Sena and the NCP.  Pawar can help the BJP keep the other parties' hold in check.
	For Pawar , the Modi-Shah support is necessary to keep in check any rebellion against his daughter Supriya Sule from his party members including nephew Ajit Pawar and former Aviation Minister Praful Patel who in the past has permitted the floating of rumors of him leaving the party . With RR Patil's untimely death and Pawar's health woes, the NCP bastion needs some buttressing.
	Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena has been having back-channel talks with state leaders from the Congress like Narayan Rane; it has also allegedly reached out to NCP leader Ganesh Naik to return to the fold and strengthen the party.
	Which means in the next few months, the tug-of-war between the Sena and BJP, despite being allies, will continue and so will the late-night meetings. The BJP will find kind words for  "the naturally corrupt party" and Saamna, the Sena newspaper, will continue its attack on the BJP with its sharp editorials.
	This is the kind of politics synonymous with Maharashtra, the kind which translated into the award-winning Marathi film 'Sinhasan', ironically directed by Pawar's closest confidante Jabbar Patel.

                            I received emails from Bhakts about black money with uncountable zeroes. Gandhi family and Pawar were leading in list. If that can be true, does it mean that was chunavee jumla for BJP. And this is post chunav reality !!

                            If you have ally like SS (who doesn't know how to be partner in collation government when you are in power. It always speaks like opposition party and create trouble for ruling party) then nothing wrong to keep good relation with other party which may help you in crisis time. <br/><br/>
It is like rather than being blackmail by SS, control SS by love game with NCP.<br/><br/>
Nothing wrong till BJP undue favor to NCP. Ultimately it is the wish of Maharshtra people who wanted to have at least two party in government. That is why it has given fractured mandate. Either BJP &amp; SS (which also not saint) or BJP &amp; NCP. More or less, it is same.

                            In politics, nobody is a saint ! Neither Modi nor the Gandhys. Both want to ally with the Nauseatingly Corrupt Party when they have their own breads to bake, principles be damned.

                            I came across this article and reading some of Rana's work gave me a good laugh first thing in the morning. No wonder we Indians pity ourselves as we are world renowned for ignorance and complaints, but no action. Bloggers like Rana who live in their world of assumptions engages the public into a discussion that has no ending and serves no purpose. Why dont we see the positive reality that is about to shape up and act on it and shape a better future for ourselves.. I am living in Canada and work as an executive at a consulting firm, and have seen the efficiencies these firms have in dealing with India than couple of years back. These were the same firm who thought of India as a Jungle with no Business ethics. With these investments, there will be jobs and a better future but it takes time and collective effort, but what blocks it is our attitudes (Complaining and negative thinking influenced by bloggers like Rana. You need to get the garbage out of your heads and start acting and stop reading these rubbish articles. When you take this path, there will be challenges but if there is 1% chance that india can be a developed country, than i would say it is possible and when everyone acts the nation will rise to what it was a 1000 years back (An intellectual Hub). This is my first time responding to bloggers, so my sincere apologies if i was a bit aggressive as i am making this move to india, to stop complaining and make a difference, even if its a tiny bit.

                            If one could go through all her opinion posts, you will come to know that she always, someway or other expressing or dissatisfaction of BJP or its govt. She even supports every opponent who had managed to challenge BJP in the political scene even though they have failed in several fronts. She never bothered worry about any other problem in this country.<br/><br/>
But she is not alone, she is one among the group of people who hate Modi and BJP fundamentally because they do not want pro-hindu party in this country.<br/><br/>
She is one among the millions in this country, who are stranded alone by the demise of congress from country's political scene and hoping to clinch another pseudo-secular front that could help their cause.<br/><br/>
She just uses blanket of journalism to express her 'psuedo-genuine' concern for this country.<br/><br/>
She is nothing but a Modi-hater or BJP-hater for reasons which could be easily understood if read archives of her articles.<br/><br/>
As long as people of this country allow them to be influenced by people like her we will continue to be show as united only to be really divided.

The   relationship    between   BJP   and  SS    has   become  similar to   BJP   and  JDU   in  BIHAR   where   Nitish   had to be   delinked  from alliance  . On going  through  the   POLITICAL   RELATIONSHIP    between   BJP , NCP  and  SS  , it seems   BJP   WILL OPT  FOR  NCP .  The  article   is very   informative   and   very  effectively   highlighted     some   individuals  like  NAIK  who  has  capability   to tilt  the  balance   .

                            Most of it from the article is the highlight of events which occurred recently. So blaming the author is not the right approach. We as a citizen should realize the fact that politicians will never change. Keep our self and our loved ones away from polarization. Avoid being a victim of their shrewd personal intentions. Love your nation... love your fellow beings. Keep life simple and do the best you can to contribute to the welfare of the society... Sajid Khalid
