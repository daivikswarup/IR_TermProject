Headline::::Will All AAP's Choices Be Axed, Modiji?



DateTime::::2015-08-06T13:53:00+05:30




                                Yet another officer of the Delhi Government has been targeted for honest work. The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), headed 'illegally' by an appointee of Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung, has slapped a case of irregularity against Vigilance Secretary Chetan Sanghi - one of the most senior and efficient officers of the government. The ACB will investigate the case based on a frivolous complaint. The officer concerned has denied any wrongdoing and in clarification to media, said that he had sought all  required approval as per law, including LG, Mr Jung.
He is not the only one. Before him, a nonexistent case was also brought by the ACB against the Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister. These are the officers who are considered to be close to the Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal, and command his respect for their uprightness and their no-nonsense approach. It has also been reported that unsubtle hints have been dropped to officers of the Delhi government that their commitment to Kejriwal is not appreciated by the central government, and they should realize that the AAP government will last only for five years, so why be on the wrong side of power, so to speak.
Recently, two very bright officers who were entrusted by the government to supervising focus areas have been transferred without consulting the Chief Minister or his administration. One officer was looking after the collection of VAT, and the other was instrumental in the Education Department. AAP has made ambitious plans to make government education a quality product and to create a model for generating quality human capital for a better and confident India. AAP has plans to improve tax collections without traumatizing the business class of Delhi. When the transfers of the bureaucrats were brought to the notice of the Home Ministry, it expressed helplessness. So we can only conclude that the moves were made at the behest of the Prime Minister's Office, as has been the practice till now.
Since AAP came into the government there has been an attempt to not let the government function. An elected government was not allowed to choose and appoint its own officers. Suddenly, the Lieutenant Governor discovered and asserted that it was he, not the democratically-elected Chief Minister, who has the powers to appoint and delegate responsibility to officers. The Lieutenant Governor has claimed that he also controls the Service department, which is the nodal department for the appointment of the officers. Readers know the entire controversy and I don't need to elaborate on that. Then one fine morning Mr Jung also made the bizarre argument that the ACB should not be reporting to the Delhi Government but to him as the ACB functions as a police thana (station) and a police thana by definition falls in his domain which covers the administration of Police, Law and Order, and Land in the capital. Overnight, a Joint Commissioner of Police (JCP) was appointed as the new chief, superseding the one appointed by the AAP government. The new chief, after taking over the command of the ACB, has been busy targeting honest officers who are refusing to toe the central government's diktats.
The ACB has been in existence for the last 40 years, and it is well-established that it functions under the executive authority of the Delhi government - this was also endorsed by the Delhi High Court decision few months ago. How come the Lieutenant Governor did not highlight his claim over the ACB in 2014 when it filed cases against Reliance chief Mukesh Ambani and Cabinet Minister Veerappa Moily before Kejriwal resigned as Chief Minister?  
I am not getting into how Delhi police has been targeting AAP MLAs and other functionaries, and how Delhi Police Chief BN Bassi is challenging a democratically-elected Chief Minister to a public debate, forgetting that service rules don't permit him to make political statements or indulge in politics. He has behaved like Shah Rukh Khan hopping from one TV studio to another, giving all kinds of interviews and making all types of politically-loaded statements. I am also not getting into how AAP volunteers were beaten the whole night in a police station for protesting against police inaction in the Anand Parbat case (the stabbing of teen Meenkashi by her alleged stalkers) as that matter is being referred to courts with charges of illegal confinement and violation of basic human rights of a citizen. 
For a central government which talks about cooperative federalism, what has been on display is vengeance against another government. This shows three things -
1. The Central government led by PM Narendra Modi has not forgotten its humiliating defeat in Delhi when AAP recorded a historic win. Modi is known to not take any defeat lightly. 
2. As a student of Indian politics, I have heard the legendary stories of Indira Gandhi and how she used to ill-treat the opposition and state government governments. But India has moved on since then and the country is no longer dominated by one party. Indian polity is more diverse and more vibrant with many more powerful regional parties and it's no longer possible to behave like Mrs. Gandhi. And if Mr Modi continues to behave in this fashion then I can only say that either he is wrongly advised by his political strategists, or that fascism is lurking behind the face of the democratically-elected popular leader.
3. The Delhi episode is indicative of the helplessness of democratic institutions vis-a-vis a powerful polarizing figure. India has evolved as a democracy since independence, unlike other nation states that got freedom almost the same time. The entire world is looking at this great experiment in democracy with such a vast population and any attempt to weaken that collective resolve will not be in the national interest. The powers-that-be should realise that the treatment that they are meting out to the AAP government is being very keenly watched.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            If something is done illegally, please approach the court and judicial system. Mr. Modi cant be held responsible for every illegal act of CM. Shall we also speak about your own party misdeeds - or everything is hunky dory there ? Your 'intellectual integrity' has a fallen to such a low that, you just write coloums to please your masters. AAP is no different from any other parties in India and I need my donation back. It was hard earned money I have given thinking that India will have a new beginning - what turn out is worst nightmare - when I meet my friends now - how is your sachi and imandari party AAP doing - I don't have any answers. How many criminals are now in your party, sorry our party called AAP

                            An interesting read indeed. Aashutosh please go and learn how the Delhi Government has functioned all these years. AAP crying out loud and blaming everybody but themselves should realize that Delhi is not a state and there are restrictions in place. One cannot just move officers or appoint outsiders without the consent of the highest authority- the LG. The sooner you and Kejriwal realize this the better it will be for the people of Delhi.<br/>
Just imagine- how did ML Khurana and Sheila Dixit work without being cry babies? They were leaders and not street agitators, unlike some people in power currently. I just hope Delhi realizes its mistake soon.

                            So PM Modi has nothing better to do than micro manage delhi, juggle around delhi bureaucrats and plot the destruction of AAP. Yea that makes complete sense. <br/><br/>
The hubris of AAP is astounding. Stop flattering yourself and get down to governing in delhi. Has anything changed since they came to power, nope nada, nothing.

                            Instead of appointing Lok Pal who are indulging in Jungpal. Instead of governing you are indulging in theatrics. Listen to the barbs of AAPtards in TV studios. Instead of respecting the opposition, you are throwing out the duly elected MLAs through the marshals just like you did to Bhushan and Yadav during your NEC meet. They too were thrown out by your henchmen. Instead of catering to all sections of the society, namely the middle class, you are appeasing only the jhuggi dwellers who are your vote banks. But isnt it that the middle class is also a citizen of this country and should be getting the same benevolence from your Govt. Instead of opening new schools/colleges who are opening new frontiers of warship with Mr. Modi. If you are so interested in going to war with everybody, LG, Modi Govt., Bureaucrats, ACB, media, why dont you fellows go to the Border so that some of you will get the designation of a Shaheed.

                            Someone please tell Ashutosh to use his intellectual capital and time doing things for the common man. In central govt we do see changes, there can be more done but there is a change, but AAP has done NOTHING since it has come. Giving free water and lowering bills using taxpayers money is throwing wool in common man's eye. I voted for my AAP, now somewhere the original Agenda is lost and its Kejriwal sir's megalomaniac personal hand picked gathering. Trust me, I will never vote for you again.

                            Modi has the support of the nation to oppose and eliminate any reforms that stalls the development of the country.  The Central Government would everything in its power to stop the nepotic  and despotic administration headed by the Kejriwal government.<br/><br/>
Central Government would not allow a weird group who took advantage of the democracy and came to power, to subvert the democracy from within.  If Kerju does not know  how to respect the constitutional clauses within which he fought elections and won, then it is for the Central Goernment to take appropriate steps that constitutional values are upheld.<br/><br/>
Winning elections does not alone give the right for a party to remain power.  Unless they continue respecting the constituion that they used to come to power, the constitution itself will destroy them so that the nation is not subjected to any sufferings.<br/><br/>
If Ashutosh was a student of politics and did study well, then he should realize that the indian history also has lessons to learn that despotic and nepotic rules will be opposed and defeated like in the case of Indira.  <br/><br/>
So here the answer to your question if Modi would axe all the options of AAP, yes the government would certainly do so if if it found to be against the interests of the country.

                            Everytime, I hear only one argument from AAP supporters, that Modiji was not able to digest the defeat of Delhi and hence he has been targetting the Delhi Govt. But to me it looks like Kejriwal is the one who is not able to digest his defeat at the hands of Modi in Varanasi and then worked hard to get a chance to come back to him. Once he won Delhi, he got that chance, and since then he has been targetting Modi. Every thing that happens bad in Delhi, Modi has hand in it. And whatever good happens in Delhi its all and only because of Kejriwal. By the way, where is the Lokpal Bill for which the AAP govt left Delhi last time within 49 Days and Cases against the so called corrupt Congress Delhi Govt. And where is the moral of AAP when it is in a way supporting a coalition with Lalu, a convicted politician, in Bihar. I hope you might wanna write a blog on these issues someday!!!

And just out of curiosity, I hope you know that Delhi is the smallest state (not even a complete one!!) and do you really think that the PM of India just has one task at hand how to control Delhi Police and Delhi Government? Grow up man.<br/><br/>

Just crying on BJP not letting so things every other day, Ashutosh cursing, Mr. modi on every pity issue. This is just not done. They feel they have got more votes from Delhi, but they forgot that they were able to pull out Congress voters towards themselves not the BJP who have full faith on the PM. Not sure why a PM will even think about a CM for not ever a state soo much, middle layer is all gone n ppl talk about top only.<br/>
There is an interview of Mr. CM which I think was shot before he became CM in last stint, there he is heard saying " v don't want a CM who is soo laachar n cries that police is not in our control, give us power we will show what we can do" what are you doing now?? Every  alternate day post an article here n curse Modi for every small thing... This is shamefull

                            AAP Govt. can no longer befool people by blaming Modi,Lt. Governor etc. In Fact party's origin is from blame others. AAP put allegation of corruption on all parties and did not spare Media which was instrumental for its rise. Kajeriwal has failed to deliver. Middle class has been burdened by increasing VAT. As per reports water in peak summer was sold per bucket instead of free promised by AAP. LokPal for which AAP resigned after 46 days is no where in sight. To distract public attention from their failures 450 crores have been dolled out. Is Modi or Lt.Governor is responsible for this.

                            the reason BJP is saying why the officers are being transferred- is because the AAP govt is not taking the permission of the LG/center or following the constitution...<br/><br/>
But if that alone is the reason - then the procedures can be regularized , and need not reverse the govts decision...<br/><br/>
It's like a murderer replying to a judge - when questioned why did you kill <br/>

But, now every morning I wake up, the Kejriwal and his sychophants coming up baseless and absurd allegations to hid their incompetence.  Not to mention, the ads put up Kejriwal reminds me of Hitler's 'Mein Kampf'... Could you guys please Stop this dirty games..

                            The policy is simple. It is not fault of Delhi people. But where ever BJP is not getting power to rule they will keep troubling others. BJP wants Kejriwal to limit in Delhi and not to spread out in other part of the country. BJP will not leave any single chance to trouble delhi. And at national level they talk about moral.

                            *Work within the bounds of constitutional legality, and none of this shall happen. Just because you do not agree with certain provisions of the constitutional provisions, does not make your 'invalid' actions 'legal'. <br/>
*Ashutosh, get your 'legality' correct. You, Manish and Kejriwal are WRONG. If you go against the provisions established by constitution, do not expect others to sit back and let you all walk over them. <br/>
*The main issue is that you have made it into an 'US versus THEM' issue, and it is the THEM who control the Parliament where these Constitutional provisions are passed!!! Deja vu????

                            Ashutosh, when the decision to make AAP and take to party politics was taken by Arvind, it was very clear that both the main parties donot want this and this was the only agenda, both the parties agreed to. The overwhelming victory is God send because any thing less than this would have made AAP redundant, keeping present day politics. The road ahead for AAP is still fraught with lot of made of obstacles from outside and from inside. It is our duty to stay united, look after each other, care for the Delhi citizens so that LG/Modi combine continue to be seen as trouble monger. This way. BJP can never hope to revive its cadre in Delhi. Keep up the good work and god bless the AAP

Why bring Modi, a working PM.

                            These are the cheap methods adopted by BJP to kill AAP. Yes , BJP is afraid of AAP , as this would be alternative party in the coming future. Kill it is the strategy of BJP. What BJP is not realising : People are sick of these corrupt political parties , not interested in the development and welfare of the people , no ethics , no standards , no respect to the democratic principles. If AAP is killed another party would emerge as an alternative. People are looking for change from the Political parties. Instead of killing AAP , try to develop positive elements : Good Governance , Corruption free society , education standards improved , availability of low cost healthcare. These things should not be limited to political speeches. BJP : Where are the ache din.
