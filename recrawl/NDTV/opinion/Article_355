Headline::::Welcome to The World of Second Class Citizens



DateTime::::2015-01-19T04:49:00+05:30



(Dorab R Sopariwala is Editorial Adviser at NDTV and writes on political and economic issues.)God bless the Supreme Court. Thanks to its intervention, the government has accepted the Election Commission's recommendations that NRIs, who are also Indian citizens, be permitted to vote either through an e-ballot system or through proxy. This, of course, is great news for our videshi brethren. And the even better news is that while it will benefit the investment banker in New York and the techie of the Silicon Valley, it will also benefit the school teacher in Dubai, and the building worker in Jeddah.But would the Supreme Court, which claims to champion the not-so-fortunate, give some thought to us swadeshi lot? Currently, only government servants on election duty are given the opportunity to vote through a postal ballot. Why cannot the facility extended by the EC to the videshis also be provided to the swadeshis? Is it because we don't have rich lawyers to fight our cases? Let me give an example of the severe inconvenience the current system causes to resident Indian voters - most of them poor. Our big cities are full of migrant labour. For instance, it is estimated that around 5 lakh Oriyas live in my city of birth, Surat. Most of them work as casual labour. I am sure they would like to vote, but imagine their dilemma. Firstly, they probably have to lose their wages for 10-12 days. Secondly, as their Lordships are hopefully aware, casual labourers do not get LTA (Leave Travel Allowance), nor do they have assistants to book their tickets on the internet. If they desire to vote, they have to go to and return from Orissa by train, and getting a train ticket when there is a rush of visitors, as during an election, is no easy matter. Also, how does one fit in 5 lakh (or even 2.5 lakh) travellers over a few days? There are only three direct trains every day from Surat to Puri - none to Cuttack. The cheapest return rail ticket (including the 'tout surcharge' and the 'baksheesh' to the Ticket Collector or TC) probably costs around Rs. 2,000. It is a distance of 1,902 km and the journey takes more than 35 hours. After getting to Puri, they have to reach their home town or village, which may be another day's journey. In relative terms, their monetary sacrifice is probably greater than that of an investment banker who flies in from New York to vote in Delhi.Then there are many other people who need to travel on work - salesmen, businessmen, company executives, professionals, social workers, etc. Are they supposed to put their lives and work on hold because there is a month-long election?I am sure our great Justices know that there are more than 800 million voters in India and probably 10-odd million NRIs who are citizens. While I do not have the figures, the number of inter-state migrant labourers must be huge. The turnout in elections would go up significantly if we swadeshis were also allowed to vote via proxy or through an e-ballot system. George Orwell wrote in 'Animal Farm': "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."But we Indians are not animals and their Lordships and the EC are well aware that Article 16 gives us the Fundamental Right to Equality. In this, the largest democracy in the world, there cannot be two classes of citizens.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the

                            Dorab, Superb. Say it Loud. Very Very Valid. In fact I will go ahead and say instead of e-ballot for NRI's, first provide e-ballot for RIs.

                            The poorest of the lot that Mr. Sopariwala talks about, for example, the migrant Oriya workers living in Surat, can register and vote in Surat. According to the Election Commission of India, if someone works and lives in a place for a reasonable amount of time, they are a resident there and have the right to vote there (and nowhere else). In fact, this was the reason used to deny NRIs the right to vote, since they are not resident in a constituency in India. The migrant workers of Orissa living in Surat are residents of Surat and can and should vote there.<br/><br/><br/>
Mr. Sopariwala's point about professionals on travel is valid. However, they do not have to put their lives on hold for a month. They simply have to do it for a day. In this regard it would be great if the Election Commission could announce dates well in advance to let people prepare accordingly.<br/><br/>
It would be ideal to have voting by postal ballot and voting on multiple days like it happens in the US. However, we need to consider the cost of providing such a facility in India. In several states, the entire police machinery is occupied preventing violence and booth capturing on the day of the election. In such a scenario, it is hard to imagine multiple days of voting. It is a worthy goal to have, and India will get there eventually.

                            I liked your article Mr. Dorab R Sopariwala. I also felt same when I got to know the SC's decision on e-ballot system for NRIs. I really hope that SC extend the e-ballot voting to all the citizens of India, which has major vote share to the democracy.

                            Very valid point raised by you.  In this electronic age, we should build a system where a voter log in to his account through Internet and cast his vote.  Probably use Aadhaar card database to create this facility.

                            1. Courts have to respond to a matter that is brought in front of them, which they have done.<br/>
2. To start-with this should have been handled by Government itself, without forcing citizens to go to court.<br/>
3. It makes eminent sense to provide postal voting, may be even e-voting so that people can vote conveniently for all citizens of India.<br/>
4. While frustration of author is understood, the choice of language by the author need not have been harsh.

                            Well argued... but you loose the case since these migrant workers and the deshi janta are not influential and cannot bring in the kind of money the NRIs can. Government policies since the 90's have anyways decisively turned in favour of the rich and Garibi Hatao has long since been replaced with Shining India and the Pravas Barathiya Divas or whatever so why bother

STILL POSTAL BALLOT SYSTEM CAN BE RECOMMENDED TO THOSE RESIDING AT PLACES OTHER THAN WHERE THEIR VOTING IS REGISTERED.

If the jawaans have to use the postal service, the NRIs can do the same...And if the NRIs can have online voting facility, let it be there be for all the citizens of India..

                            Hi. I would suggest that all intra country migrants start registering in the cities they live and vote in the local elections, especially when people live in their new cities and towns as homes for many years. as an example, I moved quite a few states and when we settled in Bangalore, we registered locally and I vote in Bangalore even though my home town is different.

                            The author has put forward valid points.  But it may not be possible to solve the problem of voting by the migrant labourers by any means.  And one should not think the migrant labourers as gullible and ignorant.  I have seen in Bengaluru that the labourers from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh go to their native place on the date of voting (since the distances are within one night journey by train or bus) not with sole aim of voting but with the fond hope of receiving the bribe (called as gifts by political parties).  If the gifts are not there, the do not bother as to who contests the polls.  The collect gifts from all the parties and some times come back without voting.  They are provided with voter cards at both the places of origin and working with the active connivence of politicians and corrupt officials.  This may be true withe labourers working in any major city of India and the writer should find a foolproof solution and recommend to EC.

                            Writer has raised a serious issue.Whereas Indians eligible to vote living abroad have been provided facilities to cast their votes,thousands of people in India like migrant workers are denied of this opportunity.As a voter they are registered at some far off place and it becomes difficult for them to travel down from  their distant place of work.Sometime it takes them days together to reach out to their designated polling booth.Election Commission and the Government should jointly work out a mechanism wherein voters located at work places far off from their polling booths could also cast their vote.

                            I still miss the point though. The NRI choses to live outside the country; does not travel on the broken roads or suffer power cuts; is not allowed to vote in the country they currently live in....but is allowed to express a political choice in India ???<br/><br/>
Hah !!

                            please educate me learned ones - do judges have discretionary powers to grant this to RI's as well? If yes, why did they not exercise this discretion?
