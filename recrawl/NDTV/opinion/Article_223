Headline::::Odd-Even Led Me To Having An Affair



DateTime::::2016-01-15T14:37:00+05:30




                                As the odd-even scheme in Delhi ends after 15 days, I'm looking a lot more suspiciously at my red, Delhi-traffic-damaged car. It's not because it runs on diesel, although it does guilt you out when your 5-year old brings home a presentation made at school which says "I will only use CNG". It's not because my car, just after 50,000 kilometres and five years, is already ravaged by the signs of Delhi residency with a side mirror that has been hit too many times and is barely hanging on, and a bumper that's been bumped several times over. It's just that I haven't used the car for the last two weeks, and I'm having an affair with getting around otherwise. 
I think the romance is in the people interactions, the proximity of human contact, of strangers sitting next to you and being able to overhear the music spilling from their earphones. How can you not feel connected to someone who loves Badshah's Wakhra Swag as much as you do? Delhizens like me hadn't used public transport since we were forced to in college, and so when we came back to it, just the air-conditioning was enough to have us swooning. You overhear conversations and realize that some things don't change.
"So we had to buy a birthday present for her, and she only likes brands.''
"Acha.''
"Ya, only Benetton type. So we have collected 2,000 rupees and we're wondering what to get her. She asked me where I shop and I thought, I only shop in Sarojini Nagar.''
They were speaking like we did when I was in college, and yet they all looked different. Some of them were in skirts which many of us were too chicken to wear when we used buses back then, and many were in work wear. As I looked at all of them, having just put my son to bed, and heading back to Central Delhi to meet my friends for dinner, I thought, I'm doing what women in New York and London do every night-I'm moving freely across my city, at a time and mode of my choosing. Yes, it felt good to stand there in my red lipstick and after-work wear, looking out of the automatic doors to the passing platforms of Hauz Khas, Green Park and feeling at one with the gang of girls giggling in the other corner. I also felt at one with the woman travelling with the little boy who kept threatening to throw up his food- yes, we are all women of Delhi liberated with the space that this one ladies' coach had given us. I got off at Jorbagh, and for a bit, just for a bit, was a bit wary of the emptiness of the platform just after 9. But I told myself this is no different from those empty stations you get off at in London, and sure enough, I was surrounded by autowallahs badgering to cover the last mile.
Of course, what doesn't happen in London but does here is a walk being punctuated every 100 metres by a urinating guy. Or cars driving on the wrong side of the road, acting as if you deserve to be run over because you choose to walk for a while. Yes, even through my romantic, fuzzy-due-to-smog vision, Delhi wasn't ready to be a walker's delight. Maybe if it was, we wouldn't be the city of fatties that we are.
Walking and metro -  they all have deadlines, and so I turned to app-based cabs for those other times. It was all new and exciting for me and so, in the spirit of green-ness, I said "yes" when my app suggested if I'd like to share my ride. After all, it sounded a little indulgent to tell my app that I do need all four seats to myself. But as soon as it announced my driver was arriving, my stomach growled. I wasn't ready to be that adventurous. I wanted to overhear conversations, but was I ready to make some of my own?
Stressed and sweaty in January, I saw two figures in my taxi's backseat. I ran and quickly belted myself next to the driver and pretended to be lost on my phone. Soon I realized that I needn't have worried, they were a couple at the back, lost in their own world and I once again took pleasure in discovering a world outside my own. As they got off at the mall, the new-age couple didn't feel the need to say "Bye" but I looked out and met their eyes - yes, we barely met and parted in a short taxi ride. I knew it wasn't going to be for me, but I imagined if I were younger, if I were more adventurous, I might do this so much more. It was green, it was cheap, and it held the promise of meeting new people in a city otherwise seen as hostile and creepy.
As the odd-even experiment ends, I realize that my affair may not last. My phone's photo gallery has a series of pictures of the sky, and the truth is that the horizon isn't as blue as I would have liked. The AQ or air quality index must have affected my IQ, or at least my EQ, because I think something's changed. After all, didn't Delhi come together and try to be nice for a change?(Sunetra Choudhury is Editor, National Affairs, NDTV 24x7)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Very good column with a wacky humour to boot, enjoyed reading it besides walking is good for the body and interacting with strangers is good for the mind, though news readers and television anchors would find it a tad bit difficult to do so because of their easily recognizable faces the 'stranger quotient' being one way.

                            Such a nice read - mainly because it represents the feelings of so many of us. <br/><br/>
Whenever I first read some comments about this scheme in its early days It felt like it is such a bad experiment. But after seeing the reaction of my friends and colleagues - who I thought would hate the inconvenience of leaving their cars behind - I was really pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>
It seems that most people who had most negative comments on the even-odd scheme are actually those who don't even live in Delhi. <br/><br/>
The best thing that we got from this, is the assurance that Delhiites do care.

                            Sunetra, we have so much foreign exchange currency by saving precious hydro carbon in the process as a austerity measure. The commoner's are feeling their share of oxygen is safe and cannot be looted by prosperous. Thank God the process of bringing benefits to ordinary citizen has started. Now, we can expect ban on huge s.u.v.s . Don't forget we also get roasted by heat generated by air conditioners  in the summer on daily basis.

                            Beautifully written. This piece has its heart in the right place. Meeting and interacting with new people has become very rare today. If its the odd-even rule that is making it possible, then we need to appreciate every bit of it.

                            Very nice! Now, can Kejriwal do something about public transport so that people feel like using it all the time instead of having to do this odd-even stuff? Why is it that middle class citizens always have to 'accommodate' instead of public services and governments doing something for them? Odd-even is at best a success 'of' the common citizen, not of the government by any means ... infrastructure building will be a success of the Government. And for God's sake, make it 'apolitical' and a broad movement, something like swacch bharat.

                            Glad that the citizens of Delhi gave it a genuine shot. I am told the usual jugaad factor was missing, and people adapted in letter and spirit. I use the Delhi metro extensively and I am many more can do so. Felt, culturally, most people in Delhi, dont like to use public tpt.
