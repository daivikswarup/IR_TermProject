Headline::::'Suit-boot' or 'Jhola'? That Debate's a Trap



DateTime::::2015-07-20T16:58:00+05:30




                                It seems that our economic policy debate is forever stuck in a rather tedious jugalbandi between two dominant narratives on the state of the Indian economy. One centres around growth and the other around poverty. Anytime one camp talks of double digit growth and catching up with China, the other points out that India fares worse than sub-Saharan Africa or a relatively poor neighbouring country like Bangladesh in certain social indicators. Every upbeat story about India's growing economic clout seems to be inevitably accompanied by sad string chords bemoaning the abysmal state of India's social indicators.  
As with any debate, each side ends up caricaturing the other. Any mention of poverty or human development and you will be called a jholawalla or a socialist who somehow does not understand the magical power of growth to lift people out of poverty or has a vested interest in keeping the poor in poverty (perhaps to attract NGO funds!). Any mention of growth or reform, and you are likely to be called neo-liberal or free-marketeer or to paraphrase a recent political slogan, a suit-bootwalla who is lobbying for reforms that will only help big corporations make more profits at the expense of the poor, who either does not care about poverty or believes in the voodoo economics of trickle down. 
The problem with the growth-based narrative is that, while growth is necessary for poverty alleviation or improvements in social indicators, it is not sufficient. For example, take the dream growth rate of 10%. It will take 26 years of sustained growth of 10% per year in incomes (no country in history has had a quarter century of sustained double digit growth!) to bring an Indian who is right on the poverty line up to merely the current level of per capita income, which is low by global standards to start with. Growth can bring acche din, but you would have to wait for a quarter of a century for even a glimmer of that! 
The problem with the redistribution-based narrative is that, if you focus just on redistribution, it would hardly make a dent on poverty. Yes, as attractive it may sound to some to tax the rich, if we take the ratio of total billionaire wealth to GDP, it stood at only 10% in 2012 (starting with 1% in the mid-90s). If we took all of this wealth, and divided it among the poor (350 million Indians), each will get roughly the same as the amount marking the current poverty line (roughly $450 per year), and more importantly, this will be a one-time affair! 
Growth is indeed necessary for long term poverty alleviation and the suit-bootwallas have that bit correct. But to take advantage of growth opportunities, the poor need access to human capital, the key inputs to which are education and health. While it is true that in the post-liberalization era growth has indeed lifted millions out of poverty, it is also true that the extent to which growth has made a dent on poverty (growth elasticity of poverty being the technical term) has been lower in India than in China and other comparable countries. This is mainly because of the shockingly low levels of human capital for a large chunk of the population. The jholawallas are right to harp on this. 
Consider this fact: the wage rate more than doubles if you move from low-skilled to medium-skilled jobs, or if you move from medium-skilled to high skilled jobs. If the child of an unskilled worker becomes highly skilled, then individual income will increase four-times within one generation. Yet, as a recent report by the Pew Research Center points out, between 2001 and 2011 the share of Indians who would be considered middle income increased from 1% to 3%, whereas in China it went up from 3% to 18%. While poverty has fallen, instead of an emerging middle class, what India has experienced is a larger class of low income earners.  
Indeed, the fact that suit-boot ki sarkar became an attacking political slogan signals the lack of sufficient inter-generational mobility in our society, in terms of occupation and economic status. While there has been some increase in mobility, if a sufficient number of children from poorer sections were expected to land high-skilled jobs wearing suits and boots, the slogan would not have any sting. 
The key to sustained increases in standard of living is therefore to foster mobility through investments in human capital. Human capital is not just about Education, it is also about Health as one cannot learn in an empty stomach or while suffering from chronic malnutrition or preventable diseases. Markets create opportunities for those with human capital and it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that the poor acquire the human capital necessary to take advantage of these opportunities. Fostering investment in the human capital of children is therefore a win-win strategy - it helps achieve both higher growth rates and reduces poverty, and removes the apparent tension between these objectives as implied by the growth versus redistribution debate.   
It is in this context that one has to view the cuts in social sector spending in the latest budget with concern. Defenders will point to the greater resources given to states following the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission. But we cannot ignore the reality of wide variation in the performance of different states in measures of human development, and their governance capacity (recall that all the recent corruption scandals have to do with state governments). Unless accompanied by an appropriate monitoring and evaluation framework, with rewards accompanying better performance, mere decentralization in budgetary allocation is not sufficient. 
However, budgetary allocation is only a necessary condition for effective investment in human capital. For example, if we look at actual learning outcomes as captured by ASER reports, it is clear that simply pumping in more money is not going to solve all the problems, and that major reforms in the institutions of social service delivery are essential. This should be one of our top policy priorities.  
It is time to move beyond the stale growth versus redistribution debate and to focus on economic mobility. Let us judge policies, including those that are aimed at growth or redistribution, in terms of their impact on enhancing mobility. Rather than jholas or suit-boots, let's talk about schoolbags and school uniforms.  (Maitreesh Ghatak is Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics, and his main area of research is development economics.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            And guess what?? The educated middle class have less children and will grow slowly while the uneducated and poor masses have more and more children, thus compounding and adding to the mass of people stuck in the poverty cycle.

                            Ghatak's perspective on the problem of poverty is correct. Without education and health we just can't have skilled, talented human capital which is essential to drive GDP growth. One more thing, which is also of utmost importance for the growth of industries, is that the purchasing power of the common Indian. Unless, we facilitate the mobility of the poor as envisaged by Ghatak, there can't be sufficient demand for the products of industries -- from simple consumer goods to costly things.

                            You have not mentioned anything about family planning. Many of the BPL   families  have large families.<br/>
Unless the family size is reduced  our country will be ever poor. Even 10% growth is not sufficient. <br/>
Please focus on this issue. Muslim communities are the worst victims of  grinding poverty.

                            I have stopped believing in the sincerity of pro-poor camp.<br/>
Only when efficient, transparent, non-government solutions are near, pro-poor arguments are thrown to induce envy and destabilize us from the path of capitalism.<br/>
Non-partisan corruption hides under the arguments about poverty.

                            People get more money only if they have skills which are in demand and they are able to monetize it. Alternatively they take risks to make money. Otherwise most people will not get benefit. I would argue that if you have a reasonably strong currency then most people may be better off. With cheaper currency and higher incomes to some sections, the divide between rich and poor becomes sharper.A small section makes wind-fall gains at times through their smartness and at times by breaking laws.

                            I think we are still living in illusion, the poor people of India has rejected socialism that means they have rejected legal right of prosperity and accepted capitalism where charity is the only hope for poor. Therefore, there is no necessity of growth for poverty alleviation, growth is required to build capital and that cannot be achieved by giving equal share in millionaire's prosperity. This is not the only Indian trend but overall world economy is moving in this direction of creating artificial scarcity to increase price and profit to generate capital and power to do charity for poor.

                            What was the point? What are you trying to say from all this econometric mumbo jumbo? Where has the UPA or NDA government erred? What is needed to correct it? When you want to say something, say it clearly.

                            The author got into the same suit-buit vs jholawalla argument which he criticized at the outset. My 2 cents in this debate: 1. Education/skills acquired but not utilized will go waste (meaning unemployment needs to be tackled). 2. Employment generation cannot be taken for granted (example loss of BPO industry to Philippines). 3. Govt. needs revenue to fund welfare measures which comes from industry. What is required is a virtuous cycle which over time alleviates poverty.

                            At last we got some sensible discussion on the most important topic. The author is right when he says that Human capabilities are important and state has important role to play. But to imagine this in terms of zolawala and soot boot ki is  wrong. After all , for most of the last 67 years it was the zolawala Sarkar in the saddle and has miserably failed in fostering value for primary education and basic health culture ( swachhata &amp; Yoga come to mind , effortlessly !!) But I think the basic difference  Modi has made is about the weightage to be given to the desire of individual to come out of poverty. Untill now the Zolawala have fostered the thought that it is the responsibility of Mai-Baap Sarkar " to give everything free to poor because he is Poor." In the process 85 paise of every rupee of Tax money spent by government was pocketed by the members of ruling party , bureaucrats, and agents. This aspect of making poor always dependent on Mai Baap Sarkar ( which is what a king directed system will desire) is the cancer . This attitude is responsible for the suicide of a farmer who instead of fighting with poverty ( in 21st century )  prefers to commit suicide. Please remember before independence Farmers were extremely poor  but did not commit suicides like present day . These suicides are direct result of Zolawala policies. As for the suggestion by author that the centre should spend more than states because states are bad but central government is good is a typical thinking of Planning Commission syndrome of Soviet era. Distribution of power and money is true democracy.
