Headline::::The Pros and Cons of PM Modi's Silence



DateTime::::2015-07-14T20:07:00+05:30




                                One of the most famous statements in all of modern philosophy must surely be: "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." What does silence tell us about the relationship between speech, truth and 'reality'? This foundational question was raised by Ludwig Wittgenstein in the resounding conclusion to the only book, the slim 75-page Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (TLP, 1921), that he published in his lifetime. 
When should one speak? Why should one 'be silent'? What are the things about which one 'cannot speak'?
The answer to these profound Wittgensteinian queries remains vexed. Yet, if philosophy has any value at all, it is that it is opens up a space for questioning. Wittgenstein might have agreed. A trained aeronautical engineer, he once asked: Why should philosophy be the same in the age of airplanes as when people travelled by coach? 
Quite. So what does silence signify in the age of Twitter?
Let me then try and apply Wittgenstein's insights here to a practical issue that has recently come to the fore in our country - namely, the Prime Minister's silence in the wake of several political controversies that have arisen of late. This perceived inaction has provoked considerable reaction. A vast majority of our citizenry are quietly puzzled by it while others, especially in the opposition and media, have vociferously demand that the PM 'must speak'. Well, must he? 
So far, the simple argument has been that it is entirely up to him. The PM, after all, cannot pronounce on 'each and every matter'. He carries the weight of grave responsibilities and, in any case, he has been away, somewhat literally, from the 'scene of the crime.'
 
The counter-argument is that, unlike his predecessor (hard to imagine a 'Manmohan-ki-Baat), this PM is a great communicator. He tweets often, and his radio broadcasts, where he frankly expresses apprehensions as well as aspirations, go out to the nation every month. Also, he promised his electorate a Bharat that is 'swacch' in moral as well as material terms. Thus, his present silence on 'Lalit-gate', 'Vyapam' and other political challenges is problematic.
Wittgenstein would dismiss both these perspectives as 'non-sense' - or not making logical sense. 
Each side, Wittgenstein would likely say, is engaged in looking at the frame rather than the picture. Forget the externals and focus on the facts, he'd say. Interpretations of motive are immaterial. In the 'picture theory of meaning' that Wittgenstein advances in the TLP, a speaker is obligated to compare the words he utters with the 'reality' out there. If what he says corresponds accurately to what he sees, if each 'fact' he presents can be 'verified', he should speak. Otherwise, he should remain steadfastly silent. 
So: 'When should one speak?' Answer: When one sees the picture clearly and only then. And: 'Why should one 'be silent'?' Because, once again, silence is the only option when one cannot decipher the real picture.
On the TLP view, then, the PM should not speak unless he has a clear, verifiable picture of the facts that he can state without equivocation. His 'freedom of speech' is, so to speak, restricted by what he does not know.  
On the other hand, if he does have a clear view, equally, he must speak and unambiguously describe the picture as it is, deleting nothing and adding nothing. It would amount to a failure of reason itself not to do so. 
When one describes the unvarnished truth, reason triumphs and silence loses its point. The only justification, then, for the PM to currently withhold speech, on the TLP analysis, is on the grounds that he is confused or does not have access to the true picture. If this is so, he could choose to state this unflinchingly in his 'Mann-ki-Baat', for example - and the electorate would doubtless respect him greatly for it. However, no form of self-interest, including an altruistic regard for the overall public good would, according to the Wittgenstein of the TLP, comprise good reasons for the PM's not speaking out if he actually knows the truth. 
Now, Wittgenstein's perspective, we note, is quite radically different from, say, the far more sociable warning: satyam bruyaat, priyam bruyaat, ma bruyaat satyam apriyam (speak the truth, speak the pleasing truth, but do not utter the unpleasant truth).
As this savvy Sanskrit sloka, sometimes attributed to Chanakya, reveals, there appears little place for cultural nuance in Wittgenstein's paradigm in TLP, which does not sufficiently take the two-way social interactions of speakers and hearers into account. The fact is, the 'truth' is too complex ever to be captured in its totality and this applies to all statements - whether made by whistle-blowers, media-persons, party-spokespersons, respected judges, Bollywood stars, ordinary citizens like you or me, or by the highest executive authorities in the land. 
And at this point, the third and final question I asked at the start comes into view: 'What are the matters about which one cannot speak?' Here, I turn to the Philosophical Investigations (PI, 1953), published a couple of years after his death, in which Wittgenstein puts in doubt the entire edifice of logic-based truth that he had erected in TLP. There, Wittgenstein mystically maintained that some things were impossible to ever put into language. They were 'beyond logic' as it were. However, in the PI, Wittgenstein argues that instead of any 'pure' language that conveys absolute 'truth', all  humans simply play a myriad 'language games' in social space, such as telling stories, reporting events, making jokes, asking, thanking, praying etc. The whole of language is woven from these countless activities.
Cultural context is crucial in language-games, as are rules and 'winning'. So how would this apply to 'not speaking'? Well, the 'cannot speak' clause would differ according to the specific language-game being played. On Twitter, for example, the rule is that one falls silent after one has used up one's quota of 140 characters. One cannot say more and this rule applies universally. Even if you are one of the most 'followed' people in the world, as is our PM, you are governed by the rules of the game as much as the humblest 'Twitterer'. In a political speech, you fall silent after your allotted hour; in Parliamentary debates, the right to speak is regulated by the Speaker and so forth. 
What you 'win' in most such public rhetorical games is approval - and 'followers', maybe even 'bhakts'. Politicians, in particular, are admirable masters of many language games. Our present PM won an unprecedented majority because he was able to convey to millions an inspiring vision of India. But since context is important in language-games, when the context changes, so must one's strategies. 
In India, where owing to endemic deprivations, millions remain voiceless, it is especially important that faith in the political process is reaffirmed in times of doubt and public anxiety. The present is perhaps one such moment where we are reminded that, in contrast to the all-too-familiar silence of India's disenfranchised, the silence of the lambs, political silence is, almost by definition, the silence of power. If the PM does not speak, how can the powerless ever hope to do so?(Critical theorist and writer Rukmini Bhaya Nair is a professor at IIT Delhi.

                            Hard to understand, why it is expected of the PM to speak on LalitGate, a so called scam, sensationalized multi-fold by media, just because they could not get a spicy story for one year.About Vyapam scam, it  has its roots during congress rule in MP. And the CM has requested the SC for a CBI probe and the same has been granted by SC.Difficult to fathom, what the Modi haters want to hear from him about this.

                            Very good write up. The PM Modi is doing the Vipassana-Yoga and looks like a very selfish person. May god give him some wisdom.

                            Madam,PM knows his Agenda and needs no one to dictate him. MSM's failed to did the same, now liberal intellectuals trying their part.I would have loved to see such an article when a central govt. Scam like 2G or CWG was in place. Here you conveniently leaves , the explanation of Lalitgate as you call it,how it qualifies to be a scam.Again Vyapam case,is a state centric one ,i couldn't find any reason why PM should speak on that. Going by this logic he should be talking about BAR scam too in southern state of kerala,which is visibly absurd,and will not happen unless a political motive propels it.If you had his last,Man-ki-bath speech, He had spoken, about social evils, new social service schemes and even sttarted a new campaign 'Selfie with daughter' which got worldwide acclaim.He knows the problem of AAM aadmi and he know what the people who chosen him wants him to speak about.Now to conclude ,to quote Gandhiji,"Speak only if it improves upon the silence.". He knows it well.

                            With Each Passing Day &amp; with No New Scams reported, it's indeed good for Media to re-telecast the news again &amp; again.  I have been seeing this on twitter as well, the way few Journilst are behaving is even absurd. In Delhi itself AAP Govt is failing Delhities on every count, nothing is been reported.  In Maha 2000cr finding by ED from Ex-CM Chaganbujbal again NO REPORTING, in Kerala Ministers were find in Cohoots with Liqour Lobby again NO NEWS, In UP, Journilist were burned alive "NO NEWS"...Biased, or becoming Presstitutes or Selective Amensia as usual?

                            Great thought piece with sublime reference to Wittgenstein.                        In short, Modi's silence on alleged scams is problematic and will snowball into declination in his already waning popularity.

                            fact is that during elections, modi stated on so many non truths and lies that he cant now take shelter in saying that he will speak the truth only if he has facts.  Did his character be truthful enough, to say the things he said, without facts, during elections and before? We remember him saying that sonia spent 5800 crores on her illness, and that he 'rescued" 15000 gujarati pilgrims from uttarakhand floods. We also heard about his saying that he will bring back black money in 90 days and give each citizen 15 lakhs in his bank account. We also heard from Am,it Shah, that these were Election "jhumlas". So if modi is capable of Jhumlas, he is capable of speaking on current issues. Silence, like that of the billion lambs, who he represents, is hardly  inspiring leadership.

                            Maun Modi is trying to deviate from speaking regarding the rampant corruption, his party men are indulging, since the culprit are from his party and near-dear ones. So he is just promoting rampant corruption here in the country and his party. If you are head of the party, you are supposed to take action against the culprits like Shivraj Chauhan, Sushma, Raje, Giriraj Singh, Pankaja Munde etc etc. But he is protecting and promoting them. Shame on this double standard man, who has become blind like his bhakts!!! And bhakhs are blindly worshiping these corrupt, criminal BJP leaders.

                            Till the time Prachar Mantri Modi speaks, its all good... he becomes a good communicator, and when he can't speak a word due to his and his partymen's misdeeds, then also his bhakts side by him saying he doesnt have to speak on everything. Haddh hai bhai... aankhoon wale andhein hain yeh loog.

                            Remember Narasimha Rao, who was considered indecisive? Well, he once said that the decision not to take a decision was a decision by itself! And this indecisive man took many important decisions like liberalising the economy, opening relations with Israel and privatising PSUs. He was also widely blamed for the Babri Masjid fiasco, just like Modi was blamed for the Gujarat riots. In Indian politics, talking about issues sometimes proves counterproductive. Why should the PM add to the existing Babel? He has obviously decided that the actions of Swaraj and Raje do not warrant his interference. So why talk about it and unnecessarily give the opposition a handle. Better let them break their head against a blank wall. Yes, he is a good communicator. But he communicates on issues that he considers worthwhile. And not what the opposition wants him to talk about. Lalit Modi and his shenanigans are important only to the sensation seeking media. They are not issues of national importance. Such matters are better ignored and allowed to die a natural death.

                            The moment the average Indian read the name Ludwig Wittgenstein in this article, he or she would have lost the will to live as what followed would be verbiage that conveyed very little.  Nair doesn't have the foggiest idea of the cut and thrust of the real, political world which Modi has to operate in.  This world includes generations of Indians who have become robotic sycophants to the dreadful dynasty, known as the Gandhi dynasty which grabbed power following the ousting of the British.  Some even say that the British did not really leave, people like Nehru who was spying on Bose as a British Agent, were merely Britishers under disguise.  In this world, Modi would not conform to anything  Ludwig Wittgenstein or Nair says.  Modi will take India forward in his own way.  After all, he has the mandate, Ludwig Wittgenstein or no Ludwig Wittgenstein!

                            The article does not address the fact that the PM is leader of the nation and keeping quiet is not an option. If he says he is not aware of the truth, though material evidence has been provided which proves there are issues then it goes onto to say he is no different and should stop calling names on other parties. IMO, NaMo is all talk and No Walk. He has a good marketing team around him to project his name and there is nothing more!

                            I think PM wants to talk to people directly on matters that matter to them. When it comes to media or those propped up by media or groups who have been hostile to him for more than a decade, he would choose when and whether to speak.

                            "His 'freedom of speech' is, so to speak, restricted by what he does not know."<br/><br/>
That's all fine and dandy, except that when he was in opposition that same restriction didn't prevent him (or his esteemed party) from exercising his/their "man ki baat".  <br/><br/>
And the truth is never complicated. The lies and cover-ups are what's complicated.
