Headline::::FTII Has Bigger Problems Than Gajendra Chauhan



DateTime::::2015-07-11T18:38:00+05:30




                                Ideally, Gajendra Chauhan should not have been named chairman of the governing council of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) in Pune. He does not have the weight and the body of work as a cinema artiste to merit the appointment.
The government's argument is that bigger names were approached but were unwilling to devote much time to FTII, while Chauhan was. Indeed, some of those from the film industry who have been railing against Chauhan in television studios were themselves requested to head cinema-related public institutions that would require them to give time to their nominated positions. They were unwilling to do so. For these people to now attack Chauhan is disingenuous. Of course, that does not take away from legitimate questions about Chauhan's suitability.
Having said that, it is worth asking whether the government should be running FTII at all. This is not to suggest that the government has no role in supporting universities and institutions of higher learning; it does. Yet, why the government should be running a vocational educational institution of this nature, especially one related to an industry that is well-established and provides lucrative, market-linked jobs and salaries, is mystifying. After all, film and television technical institutions exist in the private sector, and though of admittedly uneven quality, are flourishing.
It could be argued the government should not be running Indian Institutes of Management that churn out management graduates or the Indian Institutes of Fashion Technology as well, or at least charge market rates for these, with need-based scholarships and student loans where required. That would be a fair argument and indeed should be made. A greater degree of autonomy, and the ability of these institutions to raise funds from alternative sources, needs to be not just encouraged but also written into their mandates.
Reports that the government spends Rs. 13 lakh a year subsidising the education of an FTII student - in comparison the subsidy per Indian Institute of Technology student is about a quarter of that figure - are astonishing. This is especially so as film-makers and technicians and television artistes who graduate from FTII go on to work in the open market. It is not as if they are obliged to spend three years producing documentaries that chronicle India's heritage, culture and society, then passing on this work to a freely-available public archive.
It is difficult to altogether sympathise with the FTII students and community. While they may find Gajendra Chauhan beneath them and not measuring up to their sense of aesthetics, does this really justify the 39th strike in 55 years of FTII's existence? If previous governing councils and administrators were so remarkable, why has no convocation taken place in 17 years? No convocation has been held since winter 1997, when the chief guest, veteran actor Dilip Kumar, was booed and hooted.
Students are supposed to leave FTII in three years, having completed their coursework. The hostel facilities in Pune are obviously inviting, as is the subsidy by the tax-payer. As such, students stay on for five or six years. The students who entered in the academic year 2007-08 should have moved on in 2010-11. They are still on the FTII campus, part of the protesting students, propelling the strike.
Two points stand out here. First, it is fairly clear that given the political orientation of a vociferous section of the students, any BJP government appointee would have faced protests and been told he or she was not welcome. Gajendra Chauhan's credentials - and this writer iterates he is not defending them - are, to that extent, secondary.
Second, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the FTII student community is now in the grip of a strong freeloader sentiment. A three-year post-graduate course extending to almost a decade, with middle-aged folk claiming subsidised benefits under the guise of being students, is indefensible. Any harsher action by the government, especially a BJP government, will then easily be sought to be converted into a "right-wing attack" on the "creative community". The slippery slope will inevitably lead to a false debate on "freedom of expression", and familiar arguments will be heard.
That is what this is really about; Gajendra Chauhan is only a convenient excuse.(The author is senior fellow, Observer Research Foundation.

                            Fully agree. Under some or other pretext left wing dominated institutions are trying to attack everything that BJP is doing. The real reasons are  fear of exposing their misdeeds/ fear of losing patronisation / fear of unearthing of skeletons in the cupboards. People should understand these trends and look at things more objectively. Let's not get misled by leftist propaganda. Well written article Mr Ashok.

                            This is typical Ashok Malik, like some of BJP lawmakers trying to fool us since they come to power.  When ever there is a case of BJP, first of all he says, this should have been in another way (as in case of Sushma &amp; Scindia) or in this case, he writes, Chouhan is not fit.  Secondly he justifies what BJP has done in one way or other way. <br/><br/>
I had raised this point earlier too, these journalist must be introduce to us including their soft support to particular political party.  For example, Ashok Malik for BJP, Kumar Ketkar for Congress.<br/><br/>
Stop fooling us.

                            Yes Mr Malik!! You have justified BJP on Sushma Swaraj case, Raje case and now on Gajendra Chauhan case as well. Not sure of your stand on Vyapam. My guess is either you would have justified OR blamed the Congress OR just kept quiet about the whole issue (Just turn a blind eye!!). Do you speak as a journalist or a current or upcoming BJP member?? Please declare any conflict of interest!!!

                            WOW - this is refreshing.<br/>
All these guys supporting ouster of Mr. Chauhan have been enjoying the subsidised tax payers money and flourishing, earning millions, billions, cheating the tax payer by not paying taxes, supporting anti - India films in the name of creativity, showing India in bad light in the name of creativity.....they need to be booed...else what explains 13 lacs of subsidy per student, overstaying by students for decades, 33 strikes in 55 years, no convocation, it seems the govt. of earlier years was hand in glove with those running the institute to defame and create &amp; present a kind of mindset which skews votes.....caste based, religion based depiction in movies , serials etc. to promote acrimony &amp; negativity &amp; divide and rule in India....the institute needs to be shut out of govt. funds and private participation needs to be encouraged, strict rules need to be placed, creativity to envision a better future of India, displaying incredible scenes of Indian tourist spots needs to be encouraged which should help local tourism and improve the prestige of India. How India can improve, what better things we can do is what needs to be inculcated in these institutes so that we can grow as a respectful and Nation full of pride. <br/><br/>
The film industry has been in the grip of goons, rapists, extortionists and enemies of India as a nation. Finding Bollywood coming out in support of convicted "terrorist supporters" who supplied arms and even kept a few for themselves is not uncommon. These high brand individuals tend to sway public opinion in favor of a certain political class or certain way of thinking of the gullible Indian. Many bollywood actors have come out in support of convicted criminals. <br/><br/>
They are not ready to contribute time or money for India but can make off the hook statements to denigrate the thoughtful govt. decisions. <br/><br/>
Mr. Rishi Kapoor, Mr. Anupam Kher, Mr. Amol Palekar, Mr. Ranbir and many others who are coming out against Mr. Chauhan .......you have let us down. We are ashamed of you. <br/><br/>
Other countries like to see poverty of India not the growth of India and this is what such institutes have been showing and not what strength India beholds and what it can become.<br/><br/>
Its a filth which needs to be cleaned and govt. must act firmly on this.

                            Gajendra Chauhan is a political appointee to FTII, Ashok Malik must understand that we have problem with this character who is shooting off the hip. We are seeing at resolution to this problem, other problems of FTII and India is hardly relevant to the current scenario. If Ashok Malik wants to suckupto the bJp the let him be a political figure than a journo.

The government should stop funding IITS, FTII, etc. Let the students pay for their courses. However, place a large scholarship system which will cater to all the economically backward and only the economically backward student. Privatise these institutions to make them more feasible to run.

Someone who has acted in gems like 'Khuli Khidki' and 'Vaasna' to be supported in the garb of problems facing FTII is an intellectually fraud idea. This government is on mat once again and the ORF route is not going to prop up again. A movement began against the Modi Government after the distasteful million dollar suit Mr Modi wore. Saadhvi, Raamzaade, Smriti, Sushma, Vasundhara, Shivraaj, Vyaapam and FTII are all milestones it is covering very fast on the roads to disaster. An election today and Modi will get 4 seats with or without IRF or Ashok Malik.

                            You have raised a valid point. There is a tremendous scope to improve this institute. Regarding appointment of Mr.Chauhan and his suitability we should look at this issue from a different perspective. The current state of this institute clearly shows failure of previous chairmen as administrators. In our country celebrities are treated as if they know everything. But this case shows otherwise. Mr.Chauhan may not be suitable as an artist but is he an able administrator? Secondly, opposing Mr.Chahuan because of RSS, BJP link shows how people opposing him have not understood what democracy is. Do we approve only Congress/Leftist ideology in our country? Third point is about subsidy and contribution to the society, IIT is certainly not a good example. Most of the IIT students who use subsidy buy ticket to the US very next moment. They happily give up their Indian citizenship there. So don't give IITians importance here. They don't deserve that.

                            All said and done Gajendra should stay on and change the institute atmosphere. Staying Power and Long term performance supersedes angry ideological rhetoric and  endless analysis paralysis. In India the battle between identity politics and nationalist politics will continue for a long time. This has to be done at the intellectual, university and political level on a continuous basis. By its very inherent nature identity politics will push India down into a dirty 3 world country which will lead to its eventual disinegration
