Headline::::Why RSS May Want Amit Shah to Lose Bihar



DateTime::::2015-10-24T12:54:00+05:30




                                The Advani-Vajpayee years of leading the NDA coalition offer significant memories of how the duo outmanoeuvred the RSS and K Sudarshan, the then chief of the BJP's ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh or RSS. Despite knowing Advani's ambition of becoming Prime Minister, the Sangh chose a man with a liberal face for the top job while Advani was left to play second fiddle; the RSS wanted the duality to exist for the sake of balancing its own power game.
But as I wrote in my own column in 2012 "Far from backing its first prime minister, the Sangh went out of its way to needle him. It consistently attacked Brajesh Mishra, principal secretary to the prime minister and one of the most trusted men in the Vajpayee camp. It wanted Mishra removed not because it thought he was a bad influence - though that may have been the stated reason - but because his departure would weaken Vajpayee, never mind what it did to the stability of the government in the Centre.
In fact, the RSS had no qualms in using the opportunity provided by Operation Westend - the TEHELKA sting operation that saw Bangaru Laxman, then BJP president, accepting a bribe - to slyly attack two top officials in the Vajpayee PMO: Mishra and NK Singh. The Sangh gave a free hand to the Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) and its promoter, Chennai-based chartered accountant S Gurumurthy, to launch a full-scale attack on the Vajpayee PMO. Only when it realised that Gurumurthy had reduced the SJM to a proxy for fighting corporate battles did the Sangh distance itself from the Manch."
It is not very uncanny then that the Sangh Parivaar is playing almost a similar game, this time in Bihar, which seen as a do-or-die battle for Amit Shah, the BJP president. The election will also be a litmus test for Narendra Modi who has been facing heat for increasing religious intolerance allegedly perpetrated by his own party. At risk is also his good governance model which failed the test in the Delhi election in February this year. The Sangh Parivaar is allegedly upset with him for promoting himself as opposed to the party in India and internationally.
Is the Sangh Parivaar increasingly feeling left out with the power equation of Amit Shah-Narendra Modi-Arun Jaitley, seen as the driver of all major decisions? If not, what could be the reason behind RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's statement that there should be a review of the reservation policy for backward classes, suggesting that the reservation policy for Dalits had become a political tool and interest groups needed to be formed because there have to be certain aspirations in democracy.
Bhagwat's statement translated in simple English meant that while attempting to appease the backward classes, the aspirations of the upper class cannot be ignored. What embarrassed the BJP was that the statement came from Bhagwat just before the polling and just about 250 kilometers away from Bihar, in Gorakhpur. Bhagwat had previously in an interview to the party mouthpiece Organiser said that "We should have integral approach of welfare for all. It is sensible to realize that my interest lies in larger national interest. Government also has to be sensitive to these issues that there should not be any agitation for them."
Bhagwat further went on to make a statement that could incense the dominating vote bank of backward castes in Bihar - that interest groups should not strive to address the aspirations (of Dalits) at the cost of others. Did Bhagwat not know that 70 per cent of the electorate in Bihar comprises of the backward classes, and most analysis and opinion polls had suggested a surge for the BJP in Bihar? Why would Bhagwat and the RSS, the ideological fountainhead of the BJP, divide the Hindu vote bank in Bihar which the Modi-Shah duo seemed to be successfully consolidating? Was the RSS upset with the BJP's suggestion for a lower caste Chief Minister and candidates from the backward classes?
If that is indeed true, ideologically, there is nothing wrong with the RSS line of thought for it has a history of upper caste dominance with six sarsanghchalaks (RSS chiefs) being from the upper and brahmin caste. With a total of seven sarsanghchalaks till date, Mohan Bhagwat like other five predecessors is an upper caste and it was the RSS which insisted on Nitin Gadkari, a deshasth Brahmin being the party President of the BJP before Rajnath Singh took over. The RSS has not shied away from glossing in various documents the virtue of the Brahmanists as opposed to the Shudras and the Vaishnavas.
The BJP had been trying hard to keep the Patel agitation led by Hardik Patel for reservations not have an impact on the backward classes in Bihar. But Mohan Bhagwat has decided to open a can of worms with both Nitish and Lalu taking a swipe at Shah and Modi asking him to disown Guru Golwalkar and the RSS.
In Lalu's statement on #BJPagainstDalits lies another uncomfortable truth that the BJP would not have wanted to remind the voter in Bihar. Golwalkar had never hidden his passionate commitment to Brahminical supremacy and Shudra slavery.
In his Bunch of Thoughts, he goes on to narrate an incident which states 'In the South, there was an English officer. His assistant was a local person, probably a Naidu. The orderly of that Englishman was a Brahmin. One day, when this Englishman was walking in a street, followed by his orderly, the assistant came from the opposite side. The two officers greeted each other and shook hands. But when the assistant officer saw the orderly, he took off his turban and touched his feet. The Englishman was amazed. He queried, "I am your senior officer, but you stand erect and just shake hands with me, whereas he is only my peon and you prostrate before him on this busy road.
What is the matter?" The assistant officer replied, "You may be my officer, but you are a mlechha (foreigner). He may be a peon, but he belongs to that class of my people which is held in great respect all down the centuries, before whom it is my duty to bow down"
In fact, Shankaranand Shastri, a Dalit ideologue and writer considered very close to Babasaheb Ambedkar wrote in one of his works, "It is a fact that the RSS was established to save the caste system and the Brahmin priestly class. If the RSS were really sincere in uniting the 'Hindus' under one flag, it should make first to destroy caste. The RSS is nothing but a revival of Pushyamitra [vii] tactics to destroy the integrity of the country and divide it into watertight compartments [...]"
As I write this, two Dalit children have been murdered in Ballabhgarh in Haryana which is ruled by the BJP. News reports have emerged that Dalit leaders from Haryana have threatened to convert if the atrocities against them don't stop. As if this was not enough, Union Minister V.K. Singh used a rather derogatory analogy referring to the Ballabhgarh incident as "government cannot be blamed if someone stones a dog"
At this point of time, Bhagwat seems to have given credence to the hashtag #BJPagainstDalits which trended on Twitter on Wednesday.
The BJP has been forced to overnight change its election strategy, which appears to be political hara-kiri. Modi, who was the star campaigner with posters in Bihar saying ''Abki baar Modi sarkaar" (this time, a Modi government) is now replaced by local BJP leaders.
The question remains: could Bhagwat want the BJP to lose Bihar which could possibly make Shah-Modi domination stronger? Leaders in the RSS have told this reporter that Bhagwat wants to cut down Amit Shah to size even if it means losing Bihar.
The leadership in Sangh Parivaar is upset that despite their cadres being used in Bihar extensively there has been no consultation with the RSS on ticket distribution. For the first time Shah and Modi have kept RSS leaders out of the micro management in Bihar polls. This has upset many like Bihar based leaders Kirti Azad and Shatrughan Sinha who have openly backed Bhagwat's statement on reservations. While the RSS has believed in consolidating Hindu votes across the caste spectrum during the election season, it felt that Shah's strategy of Dalit appeasement would boomerang with the upper caste Hindu feeling left out.
Many in the RSS believe that Bhagwat has killed two birds with the same stone. By embarrassing the party with his comments on reservation, he has sent a strong signal to Amit Shah whose arrogance is being much talked about and who has kept several RSS leaders at bay in decision-making.
The Sangh has also sought to placate its cadres who were upset with the ''appeasement'' of the lower castes by Modi and Shah, who were allegedly mimicking the social engineering formula used by Lalu, Nitish Kumar and the Janta Party in the past. With beef politics appearing to backfire in a state where caste dominates religion, Bhagwat may just have pushed the BJP to a very precarious precipice.(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer.

                            The same routine stuff of pathological hate for BJP from Rana Ayyub, the BJP has also to be blame partly as it hasn't kept these pseudo sickular folks at bay which Congress managed through it largesse. How is this a do or die battle for BJP btw, the party which has to survive is. JD-U and. RJD as losing this will lead them to oblivion just like what has happened to Rana

                            So, this "investigative journalist", who tries to bring in a caste angle to ostensibly have the more naïve among us dislike the RSS, thinks RSS likes "Brahmanists" (whatever that may mean) and "dislikes the Shudras and Vaishnavas". Does she know that many Vaishnavas are indeed Brahmin? Say what you will about the RSS - I'm not a fan of them myself - but they have been at the forefront of fighting against the rigid caste system and would be the last ones to be seen promoting one caste as opposed to another. Asking politicians to stop addressing the aspirations of few interest groups has nothing to do with them thinking highly or lowly of them. It just means they don't want politicians to be appeasing certain castes as opposed to the aspirations and interests of people from other sections.

                            Ok, so now Rana Ayyub has a direct read of RSS minds!<br/>
Now, does it mean that according to Ayyub, BJP was going to win if not for the RSS upsetting the apple cart? This means that MGB is not effective and the only hope for non-NDA grouping is if RSS plays spoilsport.<br/>
This thought process if developed further means that the real opposition to oppose a right wing party like BJP is from a right wing organization like RSS or Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. Most right wingers will love this situation, where the left has completed ceded the political space to right ad the dominating parties (or alliances) in the country are both from the right wing.

                            Nice tactics. Tomorrow you will come up with an article to say that Jaitley and Modi are working against each other. Your desperation seems so funny. You could not quite come up with why the RSS staunchly backed Modi in the 2014 elections against Advani. Yeah - I am referring to the OBC Modi - Since you seem to recognize people only with caste. why not the EVIL Brahmin Gadkari? Surely your fertile mind would have come up with some theory?? Next time, please also explain how Brahmins are more evil than LET, Al Quaida etc. lol

                            This contradicts the myth that modi and bjp takes its orders from bjp. It also lays bare the fact that politics in bihar are caste based and the current hooha about dalit killings are nothing but vote related. The media is playing a major role in this twisted agenda.

                            If the BJP loses in Bihar-as it is being widely expected &amp; reported -it would not just because of Mohan Bhagvat's statements , but because of the way communal canker has been allowed to grow and expand and a rather insipid performance on economic and other fronts under very favourable conditions including creation of jobs, black money issue etc. Even their ally have roundly criticized the government for failure on economic front. Also major improprieties by Sushma Swarajji and scandals involving Vasundhara Rajeji and Vyapam have taken further sheen out of this government's image. Recent incidents of attacks on minorities(Dadri) and dalits have further eroded the credibility of the government with their own law makers and ministers making socially blasphemous statements.

                            Kudos to this so called liberal opinion writer. If truly liberal should she not have welcomed Bhagwat's statement that there is a need to revisit the reservation system ? Instead she tries very hard to project the BJP as anti Dalit. These so called liberals will go to any extent just to oppose Modi. Yesterday they were praising Shiv Sena, today RSS. Never mind that they shouted from the rooftops saying BJP ministers did a presentation before the RSS. Now she is saying RSS is being snubbed by Modi and Shah. At least get your own story straight!

When Mohan Bhagwat / any one else say that the reservation policy should be revisited what's wrong in it ?? Reservation has now become a tool for politicians and people who should get real benefit aren't getting it . What's wrong in implementing a reservation policy based on economical status of a citizen rather then his cast / religion ?? There are lots of facts in this context which could come to surface only when there will be a debate on this topic which is the need of the hour....

                            Issues with minorities are not new. Statistically, speaking there has been NO increase in violence.(read Rupa Subramanya article) Although I am very concerned, current government is FAR BETTER than the previous one. Current government is focusing on the right issues: foreign policy and economic development. That Congress has failed for 60 years. Look at China, Japan, Korea, we all got independence at the same time and look at where we are relative to them. This government must not fall. Our demographic advantages are changing and we may not have these opportunities in 20 years.

Instead she joins the cacophony of pseudo secular issues of caste, beef, reservation which will keep Bihar citizens further impoverished.

No other organisation in the country comes anywhere near it. It alone has the capacity to transform society, end casteism and wipe the tears from the eyes of the poor. Considering the words of these bright minds who single handedly changed the fate of our country, it's surprising such hatemongers still thrives bogus claims of upper caste RSS.And by the time she published her article, 17 Modi rallies are planned in 6 days ang Bhagavat's Vijayadasami speech lavishly praised the Modi's style of governance. better luck next time Rana Ayyub.

                            Rana got it wrong. Losers can not bargain hard. So, either amit shah or RSS intentionally trying to loose is far from truth. BJP WANT this win either by hook or by crook.  The strategy seems to keep the charge or election tempo low externally, but internally within party ranks it is highly charged. Beef etc. are such issues that motivates RSS cadre. So, it is doing that.  There are hardcore RSS, BJP supporters who will then que up the voting lines, where as the opposition beliving they have edge prefer stay at home.  This happened in bangaluru in recent muncipal election and most probably will happen again in Bihar for BJP.

Both RSS &amp; Muslim league ideologue support each other, supported British two nation theory dividing the subcontinent and their main enemy was Mahatma Gandhi &amp; Congress. The main problems in Hindu society today is because of RSS teachings, corruption, hate, mockery, women more suffering in RSS philosophy which they claim doing for Rashtravad. RSS jealous Nehru's congress which provided democracy &amp; unified growth to India &amp; Hindu majority sat out to grow in that environment. RSS shattered that environment and made Hindu majority infact more vulnerable than ever. Resurrect congress ideals which is more suitable for everybody in country.

                            Dear NDTV,<br/><br/>
looking at the list of articles from Ms Rana Ayub in the past, one can say that she is openly anti-hindu and anti-sikh. She tries to defend when some terrorist attack happens , saying how her religion is a religion of peace.<br/><br/>
But she finds plenty of opportunities to attack the hindu/sikh community about how cow slaughtered should be allowed. It is people like her , who eat Indian but deep inside pray for the neighbors. Our civiliazation is over 5000 yrs ago(before even the muslim invaders came), and cow has been revered in this country forever. <br/><br/>
How casually she wants the the freedom to eat, next what do you want Sharia Law? oh wait she has problem with uniform civil code etc etc. <br/><br/>
If NDTV continues to allow such one sided articles, soon people of india will start bycotting them.<br/><br/>
Enough of this anti-hindu/anti-sikh BS.<br/><br/>
India has been and will remain the land where cow is protected and revered and for Ms Ayub, if you really miss eating beef, pls feel free to move elsewhere, where your anti-india agenda will get more coverage.<br/><br/>
Jai Hind.

                            i think rana ayyub is using taqia doctrine bcz i see she is interested in creating rift in hindu society by popping 'brahmin' name in all going misdeeds, since as far i know to survive in india no political establishment  can underestimate majority 'bahujans' at cost of minuscule brahmin and other uppercastes(thakur ,vaishaya,etc)..so ayyub ji KEEP DREAMING...JITEGA MODI...

                            Reading the first few lines of this piece, I thought Rana Ayyub would be a successful Crime Fiction Thriller author &amp; give Robert Ludlum &amp; P.D.James a run for their money. One more observation. So much caste statistics of RSS office bearers.  If I am not wrong More than 75% of the office bearers of Left Parties are upper caste Bhadra-Lok. But I haven't read, any "LIBERAL SECULAR" intellectual commentator &amp; journalist, writing the CASTE Statistics of the Leftist Parties in India. But of course, that's why they are called "SECULAR INTELLECTUALS"

                            I normally don't like to write anything to the known BJP critics like this article writer but i would like to say few points. What is wrong in RSS chief's statement about reviewing the reservation system ? His comment was that the reservations should cover all the weaker economical sections and purely should not be basis of a particular caste. Now i would see a logic in his statement. Second point is, the last thing RSS would do is to design something which will weaken BJP and in my imagination this is next to impossible thing. We understand that you don't like BJP and if you care about your dignity, you will not even mention about "Tehelka" at all. We all knew that Tehelka is nothing but an anti-BJP channel and works hard to portray BJP in bad shape and in today's world, no one would even believe Tehelka magazine because the owner belongs to a "special" category.

                            So, from now onwards all crimes should be reported on caste lines. How many dalits killed general category (GC)(yes that is the official word, why media continues referring to upper castes!), how many OBCs / EBCs killed dalits. How many OBCs killed GCs? How many GCs killed OBCs / EBCs and so on. You media morons, a crime is a crime and all criminals must be punished as per law. Do not paint all general category people as upper caste monsters. Do not attribute actions of fat head illiterates to all. You are perpetuating castiesm. Castiesm can be finished in one stroke. Do away with surnames in all official documents schools, colleges, offices, passport (replace with numbers or whatever) and at the same time stop reservation because caste no longer would exist. Champions of sosal(yes not social ) justice, are you OK ?

                            don't think the caste system will eradicate from india ever with politician playing politics and even educated youngster falling in their traps atleast not before 2050, and even than politician will find new ways of dividing people.<br/><br/>
If the pushyamitra referred above is the one that ended maurya dynasty than i don't think that he was the one responsible for shattering india's integrity as ashoke had himself sown the seed for it when he started the non violent and no further military campaign as it is a flawed ideology in context of nation state.<br/>
don't forget mahatma gandhi the messiah of non violence, father of india, that india has the 3rd largest military in the world as it is imp in nation state.<br/>
But yes i do think the RSS and its associate to have some members that are medieval in their mindset and are for brahmanical ideology,<br/>
Recently saw a picture of some of their associate ideologue marching in jammu on vijaydashmi as shashtra, been born in a brahmin family we too to sastra pooja with a pen and not gun as they say"Pen is mightier than sword/gun"

                            RSS never discriminates as per caste of a person. In RSS, all swaymsevaks eat their food seated in the same line. Caste is never asked of any swaymsevak. Brahmins becoming sarsanghchalaks of RSS is a coincidence. If attributing castes of Sarsanghchalaks to indicate that RSS only allows Brahmins for top post is a false argument put forth by Rana Ayyub. If that is the case, CPI M is also casteist as all Secretary Generals of CPI M have been from the upper caste. Pls check history of CPI M.

How about polygamy, civil code etc, prevalent in your community? <br/><br/>

Modi greater Authority in BJP that will help him in taking decisions in national interest whereas a loss may erode his moral authority within BJP.

listen rana ayub, u dumb and canny looking, u are making yourself more ugly looking by writing dumb articles. bhagwat made that comment bcz to spirit up upper castes which may be feeling demoralized due to land bill or whatever, to go vote for in bihar electon.

Rather than praising Bhagwat to speak his mind the retared journalist is talking about caste caste caste.<br/><br/>
Bhagwat is not being hypocritical like others during election time he is saying what he means.<br/><br/>
The retard mentions :Bhagwat had previously in an interview to the party mouthpiece Organiser: which party retarted maam , is there anything official with you to say so.<br/><br/>
Just because you can convince your dumb wit probably a tharki editor you are allowed to publish anything without any backing of evidence.<br/><br/>
this piece gives an impression that either you are a soothsayer or clairvoyant or a good visualiser - Try writing fiction you will do well , spare you editor the blushes<br/><br/>
It will be good if you can share the status of the anonymous insiders whose tipoffs are the basis of your speculation.<br/><br/>

                            This is the kind of article written by journalists with too much imagination and time and also a little wishful thinking. Just the other day the same govt was being pilloried for ensuring full cabinet attendance for a performance appraisal by RSS. To extrapolate a known stance of RSS on reservations to a conclusion that it is to undermine Amit Shah Mosi combine is stretching conspiracy theories too far.

                            Judiciary System (Our Courts) in India  must enforce "Checks and Balances" over politicians and police (some people consider them law or they make themselves look like one by taking law in their own hands), and make sure Freedom of Expression, Speech, Press, Assembly and Petition is protected for every Individual or beautiful India will one day look like Pakistan, Iraq or Syria.﻿<br/><br/>
Did police take court's permission to record citizens private calls? or again they took law (on order from politicians) in their own hands and tried to frame innocent citizens in numerous ways. For example: Police started lathi charge "baton charge" on peacefully protesting innocent citizens at GMDC ground (Google :"gmdc ground police") and even breaking reporters cameras. Every citizen has basic Human Rights that include Freedom of Speech, Expression, Assembly, and Petition. Secondly, Police intentionally started destroying private property of citizens  (GOOGLE :"police brutality gujarat" "police destroying vehicles gujarat") going to houses and breaking glasses and windows, destroying parked vehicles, and using Verbal Slurs. Thirdly, if someone opposed police actions they were picked-up by police and charges with any crime and some even died in police custody (GOOGLE : "custodial death in gujarat"), some 10 citizens all from Patel/Patidar community were killed in a night.  Forthly, when people started recording police illegal actions and putting videos on internet, they banned internet in Gujarat for days. As soon as Gujarat was handed over to Army everything again became normal.  When youth from community were angry on police illegal actions, police quietly recorded their conversation (audio/video) and again trying to charge them with crime like sedition, and making innocent citizen into criminal.  WE REQUEST HIGH COURT AND SUPREME COURT TO LOOK INTO EVENTS BEFORE THIS CONVERSATION (audio/video) POLICE IS PRESENTING IN COURT AGAINST THE CITIZENS AND ACT ACCORDINGLY...  HOW WILL OUR LAW PUNISH COPS IN THESE VIDEOS (many videos online) AND WILL THEY CHARGE COPS WHO KILLED INNOCENT CITIZENS IN THEIR CUSTODY WITH MURDER? SO NO COP IN INDIA WOULD EVER DARE TO TAKE LAW IN THEIR OWN HANDS, AND THINK TWICE BEFORE MISUSING THE POWER. <br/><br/>
Please google "Patidar Surat" and "Patidar Ahmedabad" to see Millions of youth rally to for a cause, and also see how they and their leaders were denied "freedom of expression", their leaders harassed and charged with crime to put end to the movement. <br/><br/>
WE REQUEST EDUCATED PEOPLE TO INVESTIGATE THE ISSUE, HUMAN RIGHT ACTIVIST, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST AND DOCUMENTARY MAKERS MUST VISIT GUJARAT TALK TO LOCALS AND SHOW THE WORLD TRUTH ABOUT GUJARAT

                            A biased, bigoted and idiotic analysis. One may or may not agree with the BJP's ideology or policies, but one's analysis should make sense and not be spiteful wishful thinking.

                            Every election is test for Modi's governance ? He is elected for 5 years, and state elections are no test for center. Blog writers should understand federal structure and not play in hands of politicians, who will even look at municipal election in districts as test for centers policies. Secondly, can we try and be less cunning ? Look at so many interpretations this writer has about RRS, Advani, Modi, Mishra and what not ! At best this blog is bundle of biased assumptions, not reflection of reality. Write things that have facts, not figment of imagination

                            BJP should break its ideological ties with the RSS and take space vacated by Congress as a democratic, inclusive political party committed to the Constitution providing only governance rather than promoting religion. Peoples faith vary and their thinking changes with time but democratic values shall remain intact. The Party should think whether it would still be there after 50 years from now.

                            the writer seems to take very selective things into picture. also its quite inappropriate or may be irrelevant to compare the then RSS vs Vajpayee with todays RSS. one should not forget that according to these very writers modi and amit shah become RSS at their convenience when something bad happens in the country. everyone was up in arms when riots happened in gujarat and the state govt was at fault. suddenly when something happens in dadri, UP its the centres fault. its so convenient that u cant even fool the less intelligent.

                            Yes , BJP should loose Bihar , the rainbow coalition and states like Bihar should not be in the kitty of BJP -even Gods cannot save Biharis and Bihar from the ruin even after 200,000 years , this state will remain in this jungle like condition -afterall there is an element of Karma in that if you believe in the Hindu doctrine

                            Where are these Sickulars and so called Intellectuals in case of any calamities.It is only organisations like RSS, Sikh organisations which come in forefront for any rescue operations.Even in J&amp;K floods,it would have been a very good opportunity toeliminate all secessionists and claimthat they were untraceable due to foods. STill this India so all those sessecionist leders are still alive and spewing venom against India. Where were all these Intellectuals at time of Uttrakhand, Mumbai blasts, J&amp;K floods.They were all busy enjoying vacations in foreign or denigrating India on International forums. The time has cometo really be Intolerant against any such activits and show themthe door if they feelthat India is losing tolerance.Let themmove to whichever country they think is more tolerant than India.
