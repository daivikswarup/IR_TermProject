Headline::::For NREGA, Tamil Nadu Is The Only Hope



DateTime::::2016-02-01T18:18:00+05:30




                                NREGA, today celebrating its 10th anniversary, has received a hostile reception from the current political dispensation. The Rajasthan Chief Minister questioning the need for a law, the then Rural Development minister's suggestion to limit NREGA to a few districts, and the Prime Minister's speech in Parliament in 2015 reveal the BJP's hostility and double standards (NREGA was passed unanimously in 2005).
Yet, it would be wrong to lay the entire blame on this government. The perceived "success" of NREGA in UPA-1 became a burden under UPA-2. Instead of consolidating on the basics (work on demand, timely payments, better assets, participatory planning), other objectives were foisted on NREGA - convergence, sanitation, self-help groups, unionizing labour, political packaging through construction of "Rajiv Gandhi" bhawans.
From the start in 2005, NREGA embraced technology. NREGASoft, a management information system (MIS), was specially designed. It has its flaws but greatly facilitated implementation and brought unprecedented transparency to the programme. Similarly, around 2008-9, it was ordered that NREGA wages be paid only through bank and post office accounts (instead of cash in hand) to curb corruption.
Come UPA-2, NREGA went from being technology-friendly to being technocracy-servient. The corruption discourse was so dominant that before the impact of wage payment through bank accounts could be evaluated, electronic muster rolls (EMRs) - attendance sheets - were introduced. The names of those who applied for work were to be entered in NREGASoft, to generate these EMRs or attendance sheets with pre-printed names. The rationale for EMRs was that when labourers demanded work, they could have a dated receipt as proof to claim their unemployment allowance (as per the Act if work is not provided within 15 days). Further, EMRs were meant to check corruption. It was felt that with paper MRs, names of workers who never came to the worksite ("fake names") were being entered, and EMRs or electronic attendance sheets could put an end to this malpractice.
In practice, EMRs have solved neither of the two problems. In many areas, work is provided to those who show up at the worksite, and their attendance is maintained in a kachha register. This register is used to generate post-dated work demand and EMRs. The tear-off receipt in the work demand form remains with NREGA functionaries. This means workers do not have proof to demand unemployment allowance if work is not provided. As far as "fake names" are concerned, EMRs allow that sort of corruption to continue. Fake labourers can bully or collude with NREGA functionaries to register them.
In a nutshell, except in small pockets, EMRs have been damaging: they have undermined the right to demand work at the worksite, added extra layers of paperwork (the kachha records and the work demand forms), and in some places brought back middlemen (because workers don't know where and how to apply).
The technocratic approach has been accompanied by over-centralization. Around 2014-15, the ministry issued over 1,000 circulars related to the MIS. Instead of each state having an NREGA fund to allocate, the Electronic Fund Management System (EFMS) has centralized the flow of funds. In West Bengal, an exasperated Block Development Officer told us that it took him eight hours to process one payment through the EFMS. State funds are up (in the "cloud") for grabs on a first-come-first-serve basis. As soon as NREGA staff hear that funds are available, they all start processing pending payments. Those with better internet connectivity (and luck!) manage successfully, those in remoter areas are left hanging. The trauma was similar to that which one experiences booking a tatkal train ticket, where after one has made the payment, the transaction can still fail at the last step.
Worse, before one set of changes could take root, another change would be brought in. One official said "Before we had read the previous one, a new circular would arrive". For instance, before EFMS related issues were resolved, the Public Fund Management System (PFMS) has been introduced (in Karnataka, 38,000 payments are crippled due to PMFS). NREGA functionaries have yet to learn what "PMFS" stands for and "Ne-FMS" is in the wings.
The alleged benefits of aadhaar and biometric authentication at the time of withdrawing NREGA wages have long been debunked. With wages being paid into bank accounts, wage corruption is only possible by coercing or colluding with labourers. Coercion means that once the labourer has withdrawn her wages, money is forcefully taken away. Collusion means that the labourer himself becomes party to corrupt practices (i.e. fake labourers who are on MRs, but never work). Coercion and collusion can both continue even with biometric authentication.
Since 2013, the Supreme Court has ordered several times that aadhaar is not compulsory. The ministry has repeatedly attempted to evade these orders. One-line clarifications (that aadhaar is not compulsory) are accompanied with half-page instructions on how to seed aadhaar into NREGASoft.  
 
NREGASoft was reworked so that work demand could only be registered if it was accompanied by the aadhaar number. An exemption feature exists, but is not understood by field staff. More recently, written circulars have been replaced by verbal pressure (e.g. through video conferences) to achieve aadhaar-integration. The message is clear - no aadhaar, no work.
The pressure to ensure aadhaar-integration has been so immense that in some states, field staff deleted job cards when the aadhaar number was unavailable. In Chitradurga (Karnataka), 10-15 crores of wages from 2014-2015 are were held up for a year. When payments were being processed, their job cards could not be traced in NREGASoft. Upon enquiry, the district administration learnt field staff had deleted them to achieve "100 percent aadhaar-seeding". Similar instances have been reported in Jharkhand too.
 
The only hope for NREGA comes from Tamil Nadu (TN). Technology has been put to good use, NREGA administrators have remained firm masters. In TN, NREGA labourers have remained at the centre of administrator's efforts. In 2014-2015, each job cardholder got 32 days of work on average (in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, the average was 17 days). Women's share in total employment was 85 percent (68 and 59 percent in Rajasthan and AP respectively).
Tamil Nadu has successfully resisted Delhi's attempts at overcentralized technocratic control. In 2008-2009, when the central ministry wanted the transition to bank payments within a year, TN ignored Delhi's deadlines. Ensuring low corruption in others ways, the transition was completed in about five years. Similarly, the state does not use EMRs at all, is able to ensure timely employment and wages are mostly paid within seven days. The worker-centric efforts in Tamil Nadu provide the greatest hope for NREGA's future.(Reetika Khera is ICCR Visiting Professor at King's College, London and teaches at IIT Delhi.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            NREGA was a stupid idea. It was nothing but disguised state charity. It robbed the country of scarce resources to pay selected communities for unnecessary work. It was an open invitation to corruption. Everything that the UPA did was either stupid or corrupt. NREGA combined both.

                            NREGA is a success in Tamil Nadu. However, this has resulted in failure of getting Farm labourers. Nobody wants to do farm work anymore.

                            I have never been very fond of the govt creating jobs for the people. But when it comes to dealing with extreme poverty there are very few alternative options. Question to ask is why states like Maharashtra that are up there in terms of farmer suicides arent able to emulate the success of TN

                            This is quite amazing. One would have thought states with the highest farmer suicide rates would have been the most desperate to make it work. Instead its a state which is already quite well off that has done well. Tamil Nadu is indeed emerging as a poor friendly state. The disaster management team of the state got an NDTV award this year as well. Besides I have read quite a bit about other pro-poor schemes of the present TN govt. A scheme to give away goats to the poor as a farming initiative has apparently been quite a success too. <br/>
Instead of one off articles wouldnt it be better of scholars like Miss Khera are allowed to perform social audits and summarize what works well and what doesnt and why so other states have the opportunity to emulate the successes and the union govt too can strike the right balance in monitoring these schemes

                            Good Article.. NREGA should also consider expanding into Private public partnership to provide unskilled labour to the agriculture industry / farms. Currently due to NREGA the agricultural farms are short of labours and the farmers are unable to match the money paid by the government.

                            So, you comfortably forgot the Left who pushed UPA-1 to bring NREGA?<br/><br/>
Anyway, your criticism about "alleged" benefits of aadhaar is short sighted. In India, corruption loopholes are found over time. Once someone figures out, everyone follow, hack the system and exploit the benefits (see subsidies, reservations). Then it becomes a political quagmire to fix and becomes yet another unfair system that everyone cribs and does nothing about.<br/><br/>
Aadhaar was built proactively to stop it. NREGA is the first use case for Aadhaar (tough one too, because it was a test to see if technology could connect government to the lowest end of the social class). If successful, it could have given India the power to connect with every citizen by cutting through middlemen i.e. bureaucratic government machinery. Tamilnadu is successful precisely because of that - it has efficient government machinery. That's not a replicable model (atleast not in short term). That's why you need Aadhaar. I am upset that Supreme court and Parliament standing committee (headed by Yashwant Sinha) rejected it and you are toeing their line. This short sightedness is why we will never "get" technology!

                            How has TN avoided corruption ? The article is completely unclear on this aspect. Without going into the merrits of the technology, it is clear that the simple solution would have to delink the claim processing from the actua payment. This is a common occurance at many commercial organisations where supplier's bills are processed but payment made only on due date. Why can this not be done ? <br/><br/>
The whole problem with NREGA is that it encourgaes corruption by misrepresentation of the number of workers. Insistence of Aadhar came from the assumption that Aadhar could help track payments based on the Aadhar Card number. Alternate solutions are not being provided either in this article or by those who advocate NREGA. It is important to understand that tax collections are being lost due to this type of corruption and it has to be plugged.

                            My first ever comment in NDTV.  <br/><br/>
MNREGA is a disaster at least in TN.  In my village and in almost all part of TN, people work for 15 minutes and sleep for rest of the day and earn Rs. 170 per day.  Hard working people are getting spoiled with this useless scheme.  NDA should spend MNREGA money in rural infrastructure like building lakes, check dams, linking rivers via contractors and people getting jobs indirectly.  <br/><br/>
People did not vote for Modi to remind the bad things of UPA.  Had we wanted that, we would have voted for UPA directly.  Hope the current central government make swift changes to schemes that drains the coffin with no real improvement.

                            Well whats the point... Congress government ensured they wont allocate funds to TN... Whats with that side of the story?<br/><br/>
Neither Congress nor BJP is going to Resolve Cauvery Dispute...instead they are doubling up effort to build more DAM's in Karnataka to destroy 5000 Year old Farming lands.<br/><br/>
Who is bothered about Slow Murder of a civilization in cauvery belt, while farmers give up on farming. <br/>
What good will MNREGA will do.

                            MNREGA is structurally flawed.<br/><br/>
1) It is one way traffic of money being put into a pit without any feedback or need for feedback.<br/><br/>
2) It just robs taxpayers of money and disributes it to the politicians in the respective villages claiming panchayats to be gods.<br/><br/>
3) It creates what is referred to an "Asset Liability" mismatch and therefore can never be a self sustaining model. The assets that are created do not end up creating income??<br/><br/>
4) It is an open invitation for the corrupt, powerful and connected. Who gets the jobs, who get the money, how much money is the beneficiary paid? All these are breeding grounds for corruption. <br/><br/>
5) It destroys agricultural economy by creating artificial shortage of labour, not because it gives better income, but it just stops people from working productively and instead have 100 days of day out for a packet of biryani and a drink. All it ends up giving is just hangover. Effectively it ends up wasting 1 work day + one hangover day of productive agricultural work, thereby hurting agriculture.<br/><br/>
6)The BJP is unable to dump MNREGA not because they want to promote congress, but because they fear that if the corruption is stopped the corrupt, the powerful and the connected will manage to take votes away from them.<br/><br/>
7) MNREGA has increased the inflation and black economy by pumping cash mindlessly into the economy and created artificial liquidity.<br/><br/>
8) The only thing that i appreciate is the intent of NREGA to alleviate poverty. Unfortunately it is so structurally flawed that it has to be dumped for good. It is just feeding corrupt monsters

                            is it so difficult for the government to understand that to improve the condition of the poorest in India, the govt. has to provide the tools. the manual digging tools, the basket, naked torso and dirty dhoti --- is so "Mother India" that was 50 years ago. The government has to do better. Provide some clothes good for working outdoors, provide a Tata or Mahindra made "Digger" so the result is ten times better so you can increase the pay by 2 times. Tata and Mahindra will provide employment to 100,000 employees if you order 100,000 of those diggers . This way all the irrigation works can be finished - that were started 20 years ago ... and the farmers will have the water they need so much. Did i just say something miraculously genius which the Govt. cannot think about?
