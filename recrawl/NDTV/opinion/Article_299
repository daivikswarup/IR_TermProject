Headline::::Trinamool Clear On Strategy For Bengal Elections



DateTime::::2016-03-08T02:02:00+05:30




                                While Kerala and Tamil Nadu will play a one-day match, West Bengal has been sent in to play a seven-day test match. I am referring of course to the assembly election schedule announced by the Election Commission (EC). The lengthy schedule did take us in the Trinamool Congress by a bit of surprise, but we have shouldered arms and taken fresh guard. To continue the cricket analogy, our eyes are on the ball, not on the umpire. As far as we can see, there are 294 seats and this is a 294-over match.
 
Usually, elections in West Bengal begin in the North and then move down to the South. This time, they will begin in Jangalmahal. The Election Commission have done well starting with the constituencies in the Jangalmahal region, which saw Maoist turbulence and where the Trinamool government has strived to bring peace and development, without compromising on the law.
 As the election dates were announced, the enthusiasm and quiet confidence of our workers began to become obvious. Media friends have asked me about our campaign issues and communication strategy. It is very simple. We are strengthened by the record of development over the past five years under Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. The communication roll-out begins next week. It has been designed completely in-house by old hands and party loyalists. It will give voters a simple message: What has been done in your district, by way of development, by the Trinamool government?
 
To me personally, this election completes a circle. As a younger person and a working professional in Kolkata in the 1980s and 1990s, I realised the CPI(M)-led government was letting down West Bengal. I also sensed that the Congress was either not in a position to defeat the CPI(M), or just not interested. It was this anguish that forced Mamata Banerjee to set up Trinamool on January 1, 1998. She was disappointed and angry that her erstwhile colleagues in the Congress were sabotaging her efforts to take on the Communists. They were mocked as "watermelons" - green outside but red inside.
 
What was a political belief then is public knowledge today. The Congress and the CPI(M), two also-ran parties, have joined hands in West Bengal. They will not succeed in dislodging Trinamool, but I do wonder with what face they will attack each other in the Kerala election. Why don't they sit across the table in Thiruvananthapuram and swap seats? Why have a mock fight at all? So ridiculous is the situation that for all the false bravado, the CPI(M) state party chief, who is also leader of the opposition in the outgoing West Bengal assembly, has little or no chance of winning his own assembly seat.
 
When elections come, parties in government often change a lot of candidates and drop current MLAs so as to offset local unpopularity. It is a measure of Trinamool's work that 90 per cent of the MLAs who won in 2011 have been retained and are contesting again. Our list of 294 candidates has already been announced. We had been working on it for months and were ready well before the dates were known. Other than traditional politicians, an eclectic mix of well-known professionals from other fields has been inducted.
 
Three former national footballers - Bhaichung Bhutia, Syed Rahim Nabi and Dipendu Biswas - as well as former Bengal cricket captain Lakshmi Ratan Shukla are contesting on Trinamool tickets. So is young movie star Soham, as well as some who have come from backgrounds as diverse as investment banking, medicine, the legal fraternity and the media. The effort to broad-base the party and bring a variety of talent into our public life has been a constant theme of Mamata Banerjee's leadership.
 
Finally, a little about numbers. How many seats will Trinamool win this time? I am hesitant to name a number not because I fear a drop from 2011 - far from that - but because I am unsure about how high the tally can go. As Mamata Banerjee said the other day, "We are dedicating all 294 seats to the people of Bengal. Let them decide how many seats to bless us with."(Derek O'Brien is leader, Parliamentary party Trinamool Congress (RS), and Chief National spokesperson of the party.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Clear mind, clear vision, clear strategy and will be clear winners for the upcoming elections as well, TMC. Like Sir mentioned the 5 years of development cannot go unnoticed and the people of Bengal will vote for TMC again whether its a one day or 7 day election schedule. The EC think by making it 7 days maybe the voter could get biased but they are sadly mistaken. Minds are made up and everyone knows who will be running are state after these elections. This is just a formality.

                            Our Strategy is clear and the outcome will be the same as it was in the last Assembly Election, i.e Trinamool will be victorious once again and will rule for another 20-30 years. We have seen that the corruption and killing has decreased ever since Trinamool has come to power. Mamata Didi has rid us of the plague we once had which was CPI(M) and we thank her for that and for all the development that has taken place ever since she became Chief Minister.

                            Amazing article as always. Thank you for enlightening us with the motive of your party. The alliance of CPIM &amp; Congress wont make any kind of difference in Bengal. They as a party are weak. They have nothing new to offer. In the past we have seen and had given chances to both the parties but the results were very bad CPIM nor Congress could do what TMC has done in the last 5 years. The people of Bengal have seen the change for good, we are quiet sure they will bless TMC with all 294 seats.

                            Hey Derek...if you know any history, the watermelon is right there in your TMC cabinet - Subrata Mukherjee. And everyone knows your strategy - violence, booth capturing, jamming and rigging.

                            The main thing going for the TMC is the lack of an opposition in Bengal. The alternative CPM is too ghastly an entity to be even considered. Therefore in spite of the rapes, murders and scams committed by the TMC, in all probability they will get a second term. Make good use of it, because this will be the last term in office.

                            CPM and Congress to gain significantly. Even polls suggest TMC may only win 2 seats more than halfway mark. During campaign 3-5% vote will switch

                            TMCs cyber cell fully deployed it seems..Some of the achievements of TMC recently just to refresh the ace Quiz Master's failing memomory<br/><br/>
1.Bengal topped as rape capital in the country as per the latest report tabled in the house<br/>
2. no business house has made fresh investments in Bengal in last 5 years,<br/>
3. Ratan Tata has been tagged as "Mad"<br/>
4.Oracle declares new investments in all Tier 1 and 2 IT hubs - kolkata not even in the list.<br/>
5. Singur, which was supposed to be a bustling industrial town, now survives on 2000 rupees monthly dole and 2Kg rice. That's the money TMCs cadres spend in 5 mins during their alcohol parties in the clubs. Mamata tells the impoverished farmers that they will have to wait 50 years for a result.<br/>
6. Inflation in Bengal is alarmingly low, which means there is no demand in the market for products which means Bengal's economics is on low trajectory<br/>
7.Law and order is in shambles - proven beyond doubt with the ECs declaration of 7 phase polling. It seems Bengal has surpassed UP and Bihar in lawlessness<br/>
8. Tea garden workers in NB ( which was supposed to be Switzerland as per Mamata's poll promise last time) are committing suicide regularly<br/>
9. The entire state is running on doles and alms. Doles to clubs out of tax payers money to feast every two months,doles to clerics etc.<br/><br/>
Bengal has put to shambles by a visionless CM who is intolerant to debate, criticism and ideas. God save Bengal from another of her terms. else Bengal RIP
