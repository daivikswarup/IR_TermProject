Headline::::What Mohan Bhagwat Really Said on Reservation



DateTime::::2015-09-23T00:23:00+05:30




                                Having read the Organiser interview with Mohan Bhagwat, chief of the RSS, I am left scratching my head. Going by media reports, one expected an interview devoted to the issue of reservations and making strong recommendations. What one found instead was a long conversation on the relevance of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and his philosophy of "Integral Humanism".
 
Much of the interview is abstract and stream-of-consciousness. The subject of reservations comes up twice. First, there is a long question: "In political science it is taught that pressure groups make democracy vibrant. Panditji (Upadhyaya) believed that we need to take care of each other's interests and move forward. How [do] you see agitations such as demand for 'One Rank, One Pension' or reservations from the Integral Humanist perspective?"
 
Bhagwat gives an elaborate answer wherein he says, "Interest groups are formed because we have certain aspirations in democracy. At the same time, we should remember that through interest groups we should not strive to address those aspirations at the cost of others. We should have integral approach of welfare for all. It is sensible to realise that my interest lies in larger national interest. Government also has to be sensitive to these issues - that there should not be any agitations for them." He cites all this as necessary for "harmonisation of interests".
 
Second, there is the question, "You said integrity and honesty are the main parameters. Do you see any such policy initiative, undertaken or suggestive, which is in tune with Integral Humanism?"
 
Bhagwat brings up reservations as worthy of praise: "Reservation for socially backward classes is the right example in this regard. If we would have implemented this policy as envisaged by the Constitution makers instead of doing politics over it, then present situation would not have arrived. Since inception it has been politicised. We believe, form a committee of people genuinely concerned for the interest of the whole nation and committed for social equality, including some representatives from the society, they should decide which categories require reservation and for how long. The non-political committee, like autonomous commissions, should be the implementation authority; political authorities should supervise them for honesty and integrity."
 
What is the political message, if any, of these remarks? Far from calling for an abolition of reservations, one got the impression that Bhagwat was, gently and in a roundabout manner, expressing dissatisfaction at patently non-backward groups, such as perhaps the Patels of Gujarat, raising the demand for reservation. He was urging, as others have, that the call to judge a community as a member of the OBC category should be de-politicised and left to a professional body, which could comprise social scientists such as sociologists and economists.
 
Of course, Bhagwat did not specifically say this, and this writer is only making an interpretation. Yet, prima facie, there is nothing wrong with suggesting such an approach. Having said that, such as approach is simply impracticable in today's politics. No politician or political group is going to surrender the right or the privilege to demand, agitate for and accord OBC or other category status that brings a community under the ambit of quotas.
 
Even within communities and castes that do get reservation, the issue of identifying the "creamy layer" and of deleting a family that has benefited from quotas for two or three generations from future reservations has sometimes been discussed (though, to clarify, this was not a point made by Mohan Bhagwat in his interview), but this too is politically untenable.
 
The fact is while reservation for Dalits/Scheduled Castes in the 1950s had a moral and economic logic, the manner in which the Mandal Commission report got implemented and the subsequent accretion in the OBC list has left a lot to be desired. The historical deprivation or current economic conditions of a Yadav (OBC) farmer in western Uttar Pradesh and a Musahar (Dalit) in Bihar just may not be comparable. Nevertheless they get the same standing in the reservation platform.
 
Can one rationalise and add or subtract families or groups from the reservation scheme? Desirable and theoretically achievable as this may be, it is politically and practicably a no-hoper. As jobs become more competitive, especially given the one million India will be adding to the job market every month for the next 20 years, the ability to take a short-cut to government employment by using a quota will hold understandable appeal. The situation is no different in higher education, among the final holdouts of India's shortage economy. Appalling regulation has ensured demand far outstrips supply, especially in fields like medical education.
 
If reservations have to become less attractive and if a sober rather than polemical debate around quotas is to result, then the private-sector job market and higher education institutions have to start growing and thriving as they never have. That is a long way off; as such, so is the end of quota raj.(The author is senior fellow, Observer Research Foundation.

                            Why do they keep bringing up Deen Dayal Upadhyay? He was a traitor who was helping the British. And the RSS head is nothing more than a criminal causing communal terror in the society. All religions can coexist peacefully in India but these RSS people want to cause communal disturbances for political benefits. Why are people like Deen Dayal or Godse suddenly in the news and being made to sound like heroes while they actually were traitors to the nation? As for what he said on quota was quite clear, why is Ashok Malik trying to do any damage control or explain it?

                            What you sanghi brahmin slaves have to say about the fact that 5% of Indian population holds 90% of the top job?! Are you saying that 5% is so super duper intelligent that rest of the 95 were idiots?! Do you even have basic understanding of statistics and logic, one wonders!<br/><br/>
Reservation brings in diversity, and it makes the real talent to rise to top. We will be loosing future Ambedkar and will end up having more of idiots like savarkar etc.<br/><br/>
Basically you want not only Hindu Rashtra, but a Brahmin Rashtra. I myself a Tamil Brahmin, but I *very strongly* believe in equality. So you sanghis can take a hike.

                            Ok. If harmonious approach is suggested by RSS and not OROP agitation now, why did it support OROP agitations previously..? When BJP rules we need to look at issues harmoniously and when Congress rules issues can be ignited..? Is there any doubt that Mohan Bhagawat, to whom Modi and his entire Cabinet reported (held discussions) is calling for an overhaul of reservation and time-limit for reservation..? It may be right or wrong,  but to portray this interview as Mohan Bhagawat did not ask for any change in reservation system is downright dishonest writing.

                            All Govt schemes need better targeting and flexibility. The suggestion should be taken on merit. Nothing should be an entitlement that too when somebody else has to face the cost. Everything should be based on need. The interests of those who have need and rest of the society who support that need through taxes should be balanced.

                            Patel agitation in Gujarat and Reservation policy: A Perspective<br/><br/>
The ongoing agitation of patels in Gujarat needs to be looked at in its proper perspective. At the outset let me begin by saying what has led to this agitation. The patels complain that they do not get jobs in govt and that younger generation do not get admission to educational institutions presumably due to reservation of various categories. Before I deal with reservation policy, let me describe the root causes of unemployment.<br/>
There are basically four main reasons why unemployment rate is high among Gujarati youth.<br/>
·         Inability of Gujarati youth to crack competitive exams<br/>
·         Lack of proficiency in English <br/>
·         Lack of soft skills especially communications skills and <br/>
·         Lack of mobility<br/>
There are hardly any coaching classes in Gujarat unlike other states to prepare candidates for competitive exams be it banks, railways or civil service which in fact are largest employers in India. As a result even for group C posts i.e. clerical posts, candidates in these jobs are not selected from Gujarat. I have seen in the last 10-15 years in Gujarat almost 80% of clerical staff and almost 95 % of officers staff in banks hail from other states .Same is the case with railways workforce in Gujarat. The reasons why Gujaratis were not very much interested in jobs in the past because mostly they were running small businesses. Now most of the small scale industries are closed due to several factors such as high taxes, high electricity charges and influx of cheap Chinese goods in Indian market quite apart there is a slump in diamond business. Even if patels are accorded OBC status it is not going to be of much help as there are very few govt jobs in Gujarat.<br/>
Reservation policy: What was the rationale for providing reservation for SCs and STs in the first place? As the history states only the Hindu and Sikh religion follow the caste or Varna system. The man made hierarchical system wherein the Brahmin or priestly caste represent society's head, the Kshatriya as warrior, the Vaishya's the traders and landowners and at the lowest were the sudras caste –the servants of the other three-are the feet. From time immemorial the sudras have been discriminated against, harassed, tortured and subjected to atrocities. The sudras were not allowed to touch the member of upper caste, not allowed to draw the water from the well meant for upper caste and not allowed to study even. The communities which fall under sudras now classified as scheduled castes under the constitution of India are still subjected to the similar treatment although may be on a reduced scale but still exists. Go to any rural parts of India and one would will find the instances of atrocities. Very recently in a state of Uttar Pradesh a Dalit groom was not allowed to ride the horse and wear the headgear for bridegroom. He was made to wear helmet instead. Can you believe this happening in 21 century India? This is not an isolated instance of atrocities on Dalits .Many Dalit staff of govt or bank when posted in rural or semi urban areas are refused accommodation simply because they belong to Dalit community. There are thousands of such instances and I can vouch for this. Before independence reservation of some sort existed for oppressed classes and it was only after independence that various Dalit communities were listed in a   constitution schedule hence known as scheduled castes.<br/>
The case of tribals is different. They are inhabitants of forest and hilly areas who shun the culture alien to them and do not mix with others. Although they are not subjected to untouchability but atrocities continued to be heaped on them.<br/>
There are three kinds of reservation viz 1. Reservation in employment 2. Reservation in educational institutions and 3. Reservation in legislatures. However I would restrict myself to first two types of reservation.  The Article 16 states that no citizen shall be discriminated against on the basis of caste, creed or religion.  However under same Article exception has been made under 16(4) that govt will be free to make special provisions for SC and STs. The Article 335 stipulates that claims of backward classes will be taken into account which is consistence with ensuring efficiency of administration. Although the reservation policy as enshrined in constitution is in existence since 1950 it was mainly on paper as there were hardly any SC/ST candidates in govt or bank jobs.<br/>
It was only after the 1970s that gradually   the intake of SCs/STs started. Till 1970s most of say 95% of the govt jobs and 99% of higher jobs and elite professions were occupied by general category candidates and because of these reasons, naturally there were no anti-reservation agitations. Once the education among SC/ST   spread and filling up of reserved category started and one hand  and shrinking of share of upper caste on the other  that around the same time in the early 1980 the anti- reservation agitation started first against SC/ST reservation and then OBCs also started making demands. It was during VP Singh's tenure, Mandal commission report was dusted off and the reservation for OBCs implemented.<br/>
This means that fruits of reservation had started bearing and one could find SC/ST candidates even in higher positions due to availability of candidates in feeder cadre. It however does not mean that all reserved vacancies are filled. In fact there is a huge backlog of vacancies of scheduled tribes.<br/>
The question is whether the reservation should continue the answer is categorical yes. But in what form and up to what time needs to be debated dispassionately. India is a democracy and the country belongs to all. The fruits of development have to reach all. And Govt has to ensure social justice for all. It cannot allow few communities to dominate jobs or admission seats and that is where reservation comes into play to provide fair representation to all sections of society. I can give one example of a Gujarat village where from a single community there were 38 police sub inspectors. Do you think only single village produced meritorious so many police inspectors? It is here to prevent this sort of anomaly the govt affirmative action comes into play. And that is what the constitution provides for.-to ensure development of everybody irrespective of the caste, creed or religion, of course consistence with the merit. The competition in India for jobs and admission to educational institutions is so intense that large number of candidates chase those few jobs and admissions seats. The question is how to ensure merit at the same taking care of reservations. Let me define merit. For every jobs or admission whether private sector and govt, minimum standard is prescribed. For example let us say 50% .This is the standard at which the authority feels that candidate would be able to do the job. But in view of the fact that large of number of candidates chasing few jobs or seats,  one has to select naturally the top candidates as per merit  but it does not mean that candidates  below the cut-off point of general category candidates are not fit to do the job. There used to be time when the gap between general candidates and reserved candidates used to be large. But not any longer. If the cut off for general category is say 84 % for admission to medicine, for SC might be 80%, for OBC it might be 82%. I agree for ST the gap could be little larger but as the educational standards improve this gap would also be narrowing. Moreover there is so much competition even among SC/ST or OBC that only best among that category are selected. The gap was more about 20 years ago not anymore. Therefore it is a myth general candidates are selected say at 90% and SC/ST at 50% .Let the authorities publish data for the cut off point for each category of reservations whether for jobs or admission and let people judge themselves. There are many meritorious SC/ST candidates doing well in various fields but still they are being looked down. That attitude has to change. Given the opportunity reserved candidates can match the general standard. <br/><br/>
However rising expectations of young generations needs to be taken into account. It is in this background that the reservation policy needs to have a relook. To begin with -to exclude the creamy layer from the benefit of reservation for each category of reservation. Let the children of SC/ST /OBC directly recruited IAS,IFS,IPS, IRS, officers as also those holding constitutional positions like high court judges, supreme court judges, political positions like chief ministers, Governors, cabinet ministers at the centre should be excluded. Also those communities who are now adequately represented  should also be excluded otherwise only few communities from among the reserved will dominate at the cost of  other less privileged and that anomaly needs to be removed    as it is observed that some communities within the reserved categories dominate at the cost of other lesser privileged communities. For example the ‘Meena' community of Rajasthan who fall under ST category I feel are adequately represented in jobs etc. and therefore it should be excluded from ST list. At the most it can be classified under OBCs. There might be some communities within SC or OBC which may need to be excluded. Moreover this changes do not require constitutional amendment. This way it can be ensured that reservation benefit reaches to the lowest level and time should come when reservation policy should end. Whether the representation of reserved category has reached a particular stage should be borne out by the govt data so that the reservation can be done away with. If the SC/ST has been subjected to centuries of discrimination against, let the govt decide end date once and for all say up to 26 Jan 2050 and then reservation for all should end. Thereafter only financial assistance and free lodging/boarding should be given to backward classes to pursue the education.<br/>
In the meantime what needs to be done immediately is that reservation for economically backward classes is introduced subject of course within the 50% celling stipulated by the supreme court of India to take care of the poor from the upper caste.<br/>
The issue of reservation needs to be debated dispassionately sans politics of vote bank if only to create an egalitarian and just society if India were to become a developed in next couple of decades. It can be ignored only at the cost of its peril.

                            Its confusing to understand the sheer inviolate nature of reservations in India. Any discussions immediately form  poles around which polemical accusations are bandied about. Can any one seriously ask what has been the outcome of reservations in India. Mere mention of this raises the hackles and it's "reservation in danger" cry all around. Moreover it's only from these custodians of vote banks. Please let people who have been deprived voice their opinion and not people like Lalu etc.

                            Whether or not Mr.Bhagwat said what he said, the fact remains that OBC's, SC's and ST's are becoming complacent because they know that they will always land respectable jobs regardless of their qualifications/ability. Unfortunately the system is a part of our constitution and we cannot do anything about it. It would be better if the quota were based on income rather than caste.

                            Today's news papers and yesterday's tv debates confirms the bent mindset, political leanings, striving for sensationalism, biased approach, playing with peace and tranquility of citizens as the norm for today's media. What Bhagwatji said was not only wise but very apolitical. To twist and turn , make nauseating use by all for political mileage throwing to winds sanctity and sane mentality. In fact the reverberations can be felt and scares the hell out of an ordinary citizen who is hoping for a decent living.The existing distrust the people have in political parties and politicians is further eroded. The lalus, congress which gave a disastrous governance all along ate true enemies of our country. RSS chief proved once again how serious he and organization strive for a better country.

                            All such policies needs to be reviewed in terms of it's benefits to the people who were expected to be really benefited and so no harm to have a assessment.It is also a fact that it has become a political tool to cash votes for some political parties.In democracy ultimate goal is SUBKA SAATH SABKA VIKAS. Merritt is also demand of time to justify talent need for nation and must not be ignored.So best is financial aid plus reservation to economically weak students and not by cast based reservation system,because poor have to have opportunities to resources and education as there are poor in every cast.

                            I agree with the author. There should be reservation only on the basis of financial condition not caste. Because there are situations where a person is economically well off but still uses his/her OBC?SC?ST quota and also there can be a person belonging to general category who is poor. Yes there should be social scientist who would determine who desperately needs quota. Currently the quotas are misused.Today Patels are agitating tommorrow another community and so on. You cannot give quotas to every community. India's democracy is the most biased democracy. We all actually are not equals in this country. Some are priveleged then others

Now let's face the reality, reservations has only benefitted only few of the majority of the downtrodden(based on caste), can anybody highlight what have they contributed back to the country? The reservation has only benefitted the politicians and not the actual beneficiaries, so proposing to have a common consensus to have the reservation policy based on financial condition rather than based on caste and creed. The question comes on how to determine the financial status?

                            Dear Mr. Mallik,<br/><br/>
Whatever RSS says becomes automatically communal. You have made a cardinal mistake in Indian politics, on trying to justify RSS. RSS chief should learn from seculars such as the church, ISIS, communists and of course congress. I ask them not to speak in Hindi or English. These languages take on a communal color when RSS uses them. Let them speak only in Sanskrit and it is better to be accused of a brahminical arrogance than being communal.<br/><br/>
Whatever divides Indians, one thing unites us all - a sense of entitlement and any suggestions on a revision to reservations will not be tolerated even after 20 generations. <br/><br/>
So many Dalit and other Hindus convert to Christianity thanks to the missionary seculars. Yet they still register themselves as Hindus with the approval of the church to avail the benefits. Isn't this contributing to unity among religions?<br/><br/>
Also, now a general quota student needs to get 100% to get into good colleges. Doesn't this improve indian workforce that only the best can get in?<br/><br/>
Once politicos bring reservation to private companies and media there will be a limit to the number of articles you can write. Even the rabid secular MSI will get only so many articles to write nonsense.

                            Ambedkar was Muhammad Ali Jinnah of Hindus. Because of selfish people like Ambedkar, India is still a divided nation. He did more harm by dividing people of India than helping in drafting the constitution.

                            Scrapping of reservation is not possible, but we a committee to review it is need of the hour. Why a MBC candidate be extended quota benefits when his Father, Mother, Grand Father all are doctors while candidate from Forward community but from poor economic background be left to starve? I am using MBC and FC term as defined by constitution and not as per my mindset.

                            @: @Suresh: Check the cpm leadership how much dalits and sc/st were in the polit bureau and leadership. NONE. The cpm general secretary is a brahmin. The topmost leader of indian maoist party kishenji is also a brahmin. When you urself said u are a brahmin it is clear what is ur ideology. <br/><br/>
FYI, Bhagwat is a hindu. In RSS there are only Hindus. When u convert from brahmin to hindu, then you will understand hindu rashtra.

                            If we must have reservation then it is best to do it more efficiently for the benefit of India's integration and creating a level playing field for all Indians.  Why not allocate reservations to women in all of the reserve quota.   This way we uplift women and make them powerful pillars of our society, also women can break barriers better at work and improve mindsets.  There is also chances that multi-cast marriages will increase which is also good for society.  There is also a push for backward classes to treat women with respect and see them as their chance for better life.   Women are our real assets and we have been giving them back seat.

                            Distortion of Factual information is usual game that media play around. If Shri Bhagvat not said anything wrong on Reservation and the writer wrote on his own intuition, the writer should asked to explain the wrong story planted by him in both print and visual media and necessary correction is to be in both print and visual media.

                            The real problem in our country is very few among us really understands what has been said by the leader and like to go with the media impressions (?), which most of the times is having a hidden agenda.<br/><br/>
There is also dearth of good quality translators who should present the viewpoint of the leader in the appropriate way.<br/><br/>
Coming to this article, this is a very balanced article explaining the real viewpoint of the leader. But alas, many of us would not read even this article and still keep on drawing their own wrong conclusions.

                            RSS never has supported casteism. There have been many camps which are led by young men as young as 20 years, belonging to poor and downtrodden community. Anybody who attends the camp,has to follow the Camp leader's instruction. No exception.  The other guy could be a millionaire from a forward caste, but it is least bothered, he has to follow this 20 year old young man.

                            MOst of the people who write as "Antonymous" are Turushkas who are trying to  divide Hindu Society.. Those need not be taken seriously.Now Hindus may quarrel among themselves for power. Now Hindustan is having a Powerful Patriotic Army and Nuclear Power. Dr BR Ambedkar foresaw the troubles that would come to India after Partition adn suggested for Complete exchange of Muslim Population to the Proposed Pakistan in 1940 Itself.

                            Whenever we talk about reservation we should not forget that this is not a new phenomenon. In pre-independent era there was 100% reservation for 10% population and that leads to slavery. How our arm struggle for freedom in 1857 was crushed brutally everyone knows. No God or Allah has come to save us from slavery and ultimately Gandhi gives us our freedom. However, after independence we balanced the reservation policy and bring it to 50% that generated the feeling of collective participation. This results in to increase in our GDP from 2.3% (1951-52) to 10.2% (1988-89). And not only this the huge increase in middle and upper middle class is the proof of our prosperity that achieved by the policies adapted after independence. If we now reverse the policies it will definitely bring back the old days of social, political and economical slavery to 90% population. If we want to maintain our prosperity we have to stop repeating our ancient history otherwise it will not spare anybody in long run.
