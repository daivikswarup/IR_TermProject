Headline::::Mumbai Police Raids Rip Off The City's Cover



DateTime::::2015-08-10T19:43:00+05:30




                                Last week, I was with friends watching the brilliantly-crafted Masaan, a film that got a standing ovation at Cannes. The opening sequence of the film (spoiler alert), set in North India, has one of the protagonists, Devi, being harassed and pictured without clothes by the local police after being caught by them in a hotel room. Her boyfriend, who runs into the bathroom, is unable to face the humiliation and commits suicide while Devi, who is slapped by a woman cop, has to face the trauma of being blackmailed by the cops and society at large. "God, you know such things indeed happen in small towns," my friend exclaimed, as I nodded in agreement. Little did I know that life would imitate hours within hours of us watching the film.
On Saturday, mid-day.com published pictures of couples who had booked themselves in hotel rooms at popular resorts near Mumbai; they were humiliated, dragged out by the police, and made to call their parents.
"Consenting adults who had checked into various hotels in the Madh Island and Aksa area to get some privacy were shocked to find the police knocking on the doors of their rooms on Thursday. More than 40 couples were rounded up and taken to the police station, where they were insulted and some of them, especially college students, were made to call their parents," mid-day.com reported.
The report pointed out that the same Malwani police had just weeks ago been pulled up for failing to check the trade and sale of adulterated liquor which led to 100 people being killed.
The script of one of the most brazen moral policing by the cops in Mumbai was uncannily similar to the film Masaan, except that it took place in cosmopolitan Mumbai which prides itself on its liberal culture.
Commissioner of Police Rakesh Maria has ordered an inquiry into the raids, but just how will it allay the depression of the 19-year-old whose parents have boycotted her, or the prospects of  a 21-year-old who was in a hotel with the fiance she is to marry in a month.
In a country where women are often involuntarily considered  the flagbearers of morality, where have we left these  women, who will now have to deal with  families and a society prone to quick judgements and uncharitable tags?
Must it surprise us that this raid was carried out in a state like Maharashtra and a city like Mumbai, where cops cite lack of manpower in the police force to maintain law and order on many occasions? Must we be surprised that this raid took place in a state which banned dance bars years ago, but chose to remain silent on the endorsement on the private mehfils by top cops and politicians where these 'bar girls' were made to dance in real-life item numbers?
No. Mumbai has long worn the facade of being a resilient, liberal city which has no space for hypocrisy, but scratch the veneer of modernity, and you will be ashamed of the dirt that lies beneath. What I write today is no secret, for this is the very city that has wilfully agreed to a ban on beef and 'red' T-shirts in college in the past. It is a city that sells pornographic CDs outside railway stations after having bribed cops, but will not tolerate a dent on its "Marathi asmita" (self confidence) by "non-Maharashtrian outsiders". 
 
Maharashtra and Mumbai, which boasts of the liberal film industry, is flying the flag of morality of the Union government. Let's not forget that this raid on hotels has come in the wake of the ban on porn sites in India which was called off within a day. 
 
Yes, the hypocrisy stares at us when we appoint Gajendra Chauhan, a man to head the film institute in Pune, and his claim to fame are semi-porn films that he says were silver jubilee hits. Him we honour, while forcing the faces of those who were caught on charges of consensual sex in hotel rooms to hide their faces as we parade them. And let me remind you that the BJP and its allies, which have in the past let loose  workers on couples celebrating Valentine's Day, do not hold hegemony over this hypocrisy.
 
Remember it was the Congress-NCP government that was in in power in Maharashtra when the dance bars were termed taboo and hundreds of women left jobless; many later were forced into prostitution. Let us remember that it is the same state which in February 2004 saw an angry mob calling itself the Sambhaji Brigade of the Maratha Mahasangh storming the 87-year-old Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI), Pune, to destroy priceless manuscripts and artifacts. This was its way of "protesting" against James Laine's book on Shivaji, the iconic Maratha king. Sharad Pawar, whose party was in power, had in defense said that scholarship should not clash with public sentiments and faith.
Let us not forget, that in a country like India, "Morality" has been the calling card of all political outfits. So be ready to outrage again!(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer.

                            one witnesses the same in Tamil nadu where dmk also has joined for prohibition.  PMK was always of a moral niche, but dmdk whose chief is famous for drinking joining chorus for ban is amusing. And MK, the liar of all times now sheds tears for victims of drink when he was the villain who revoked prohibition.

                            For god sake, plz liberalize sex. Sex is the most essential part of life like food and sleep. By strictly controlling sex you are doing more harm than good. Accept it.

                            You were there just for sex and used those hotels and guesthouse as Bethel you human faces animals. Shame on you, but you are so shameless that you are arguing morality. Indian media lost its all morel and just promoting all immorality just for commercial gains.

                            Please. Why drag Gajendra Chauhan into this? To me he is another chaiwalla story. The poor man had to act in these kinds of films to earn a living. He did. He survived and improved his opportunities. It is a shame to  declare the man a failure as the head of FTII when he has barely had a chance to do his job.

                            I am surprised to find majority of the responses came from male fraternity. The males do not get affected by any sex scandal as compared to females. Will the author feel happy and elated if her kith and kin engage in such sex encounters with out  marital relationships?. If these so called elite and educated writers, cry for the freedom of individuals why should we have marriage acts? why should there be moral code and conduct? Their next demand will be that any adult can have sex with any consenting partner irrespective of whether they are married or not?. Please imagine the plight of the wards of such emancipated adults. Will any person tolerate when their parent's morality is questionable. I suppose mankind is more cultured than animals.<br/><br/>
Let us hope that the scribes in order get fame apply their mind before they write on subjects which can have long term impact on the fabric of society.<br/><br/>
By the way I am not neither support nor oppose the manner in which the police had acted. My comment is only on the attitude of the writers in the media on personal freedom.

                            After reading the comments below about how great our country is and has 1000 years of history and we know what is moral and immoral...feel like slapping that arrogance off who say this. Why do we think we have any rights to decide what is good for the society? you can only do it when you stand on moral high ground which majority of the Indians don't! People do all kindda stuff secretly but want to behave like saints in public. Police in India choose to be very proactive when they have easy "Issues" to solve such as moral policing. Unfortunately when it comes to keeping real discipline in the country they are "Busy and Lazy". I have seen police threatening college kids/couples wanting to have some privacy and extorting money else threatening to call parents. People don't find police a friend, that's the bitter sour truth!

                            I was never a fan of Rana Ayub's articles. However, I am firmly against what happened in Mumbai, speaking as myself being a proud Mumbaikar. Some people think, trying to swim against the tide is always the right way and dragging in incidents that has no connection with this particular incident is a product of an entangled mind. Attempt to find a pattern, I guess ? The pattern really is to cause disruption, confusion in people's mind as much as possible using such articles, so that people eventually create dislike in their mind for everything even if there is no connection between things discussed. Putting things in perspective is an art which I understand many people lack.

                            In pre-independent India, we have a law in day to day practice and that was to convert corruption of some in to development and crime of some in to blessings. Over enthusiastically we have reestablished that law recently and to start complaining about it is really very bad.

                            Not only in India but every where in the world morality has its place though the standards of morality may vary with time and place.Even in many advanced and so called progressive countries ministers and highly placed dignitaries had to resign because of their involvement in immoral activities.Morality depends on the culture,values and acceptance of things according to the prevailing social conditions as well as traditions which is a changing process.There can't be a fixed set standard to define morality.What is considered moral in US or France may not necessarily be moral in India. In India too what is moral in Mumbai and Goa may not come in the limits of morality in small towns or remote villages.

                            Police claim to be stopping prostitution and similar abuse. I dont understand why they dont catch the big sharks in this business. They trouble innocent couples but will not dare to touch politicians in the business
