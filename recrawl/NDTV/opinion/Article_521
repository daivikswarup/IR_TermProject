Headline::::Why AAP Expelled Yadav and Bhushan



DateTime::::2015-04-21T19:39:00+05:30



(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014. The former journalist took on former Union minister Kapil Sibal and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in the national election from Chandni Chowk in Delhi.)
"Not even the king has the right to subordinate the interests of the state to his personal sympathies or antipathies."
What was true in the time of the great Bismarck is true even today. With a heavy heart, the Aam Admi Party had to take the hard decision of expelling four senior members of the party for anti-party activities. Yes, Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Anand Kumar and Ajit Jha were shown the door.
It was a tough decision, but it was inevitable, especially after their so-called Swaraj Samvad where they circulated a questionnaire in which the third question asked if volunteers wished to form a new political party. Their argument was that as simple volunteers they had the right to criticize the policies of the party, and were allowed to do so by the party constitution. What they have failed to understand is that the party constitution talks about criticism, not the right to hold a referendum to break a party and explore the possibility of forming another one. They want the whole world to believe that it was not an act of indiscipline, but an expression of Swaraj.
Exploring the possibility of forming another party is an anti-party activity and no party or organisation will ever permit it, however democratic it might be. Even the Indian constitution has employed the concept of reasonable restriction in the exercise of the freedom of the expression. Freedom cannot be construed as a license to say anything at anytime. Each one's freedom is defined by respecting the freedom of others who have been granted the same right by the same constitution. AAP has to survive to propel the movement to change the rotten system. This was an attempt to kill the party, which was the result of the blood and sweat of thousands of AAP volunteers, and which has become the symbol of hopes and aspirations of millions.
In the same column a few weeks ago, in my letters to Prashant and Yogendra, I had underlined their efforts to ensure the party's defeat in the assembly elections. Despite it all, the party registered a historic mandate. They talked about the erosion of inner party democracy under Arvind's leadership. They tried to project themselves as the ethical warriors of the party. But unfortunately, the people of Delhi had a different viewpoint. They gave AAP a victory which will always be remembered in Indian political history; winning 67 seats out of 70 was an electoral hurricane which many political pundits had failed to predict.
But the whole world has witnessed the unmasking of their undemocratic face. Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav (PB/YY) had talked about the sanctity of the processes and institutions. They claimed that the party has been slowly developing a personality cult around Arvind which in their opinion was an anti-AAP premise. But the same gentlemen have shown scant regard for the party institutions. They missed no opportunity to discredit and insult the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) because it refused to toe their political line. In the PAC, they were in a minority. When the National Executive (NE) decided to remove them from the membership of the PAC with a majority decision, they left no stone unturned to discredit that also. After the meeting where the above decision was taken, it was decided by the NE that no member would appear in media including social media; it took them just a few hours to violate the unanimous decision of the NE.
They were very enthusiastic about the meeting of the National Council (NC). They were confident of their victory and that they would get the decision of their removal revoked, but when they realized they were in a very poor minority, they enacted a drama at the venue, walked out of the meeting and levelled all kinds of charges. A massive majority decided to go against them and expel them from the NE. And when their matter was referred to Disciplinary Committee (DC), they once again hurled accusations against two of its members. It was an attempt to unsettle the functioning of the DC; it was an attempt to terrorize members of the DC; it was an attempt to discredit another institution of the party. But the DC stood resolute and united and decided to take punitive action against them and expose their game of double speak. If they had any democratic bone in their body, if they had any respect for the process and institution, they would have accepted the decision of the NE and NC humbly, howsoever flawed it may have been in their opinion. Their action proves the fact that they were never serious about their talk of internal democracy. Theirs was a clever ploy to capture the party and replace Arvind with Yogendra Yadav. It was part of a conspiracy to engineer a coup.
Their desperation can be gauged by the frontal attack on Ashish Khetan. He was subjected to the most humiliating accusations by Prashant Bhushan. It shows their ruthlessness and single minded pursuit. In response to the show cause notice issued to them by the DC, Prashant wrote that Ashish was party to paid news and he had filed a story in Tehelka Magazine in 2011 to favour Essar Company for a few crores. This was the same Ashish Khetan who they had described at a PAC meeting as the brightest journalist in the country.
Prashant and Ashish worked closely with each other for more than ten years. It was Ashish who handed over the Nira Radia tapes to Prashant, which gave a new lease of life to his PIL in the 2G case - his petition had been lying dormant for many years. It was also Ashish Khetan's report which became the basis for Prashant's PIL in the coal scam. Prashant did a cut and paste job from Ashish's report and filed his petition in the Supreme Court. Ashish has an impeccable record as a journalist and even his adversaries can vouch for his honesty.
Today, I am reminded of the statement made by American president John F Kennedy in 1961 - "to pay any price, bear any burden" to ensure the success of liberty. AAP's battle for clean politics and alternate model of governance will not come cheap. Party and individuals will have "to pay any price and have to bear any burden." And in this quest, the party interest has to be supreme and every other interest has to be subordinate to that cause.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Dear Ashutosh,<br/><br/>
Why do you keep writing these articles. If you just peruse the comments that you have received on your last three or four articles, it should be clear to you that your readers really hate your writings and that is because of what you and your party today stands for. I don't event think it worth while to rebutt the averments in your article - lies, hollow, motivated and crooked as they are. Yes you have a write to say what you want but I guess you would want to say something because you would like to convince people of your view point. You are not giving NEWS, you are giving VIEWS. And clearly your view point is rejected by your readers everytime - just see the comments your articles receive. So please spare us the trauma of your views and please stop abusing the privilege that you get of getting hosted by NDTV website.<br/><br/>
I think what you want to achieve through these writings is Arvind Kejriwal's continued 'aashirvad', by proving to him that your are his unceasing sycophant. Go ahead and grab more and more bounties but please spare us the humiliation of finding another article by you every week.

                            Dear Ashutosh, Good attempt to convince the passionate faceless people like me who gave heart and soul for aap. However the moment you sacked admiral Ramdoss, your team lost credibility. Now everything you do will be looked at with Suspicion. As Priya James said in her blog few days back, AAP(the left over bit) may be the best party in india for next 3-4 year but with each compromise it slowly degenerate and stoop to the level of other political parties. We are heartbroken to see this transition but powerless to do anything. The powerful want to do nothing but write articles.

Shouldn't AK be expelled for this same reason based on what he said on the "Sting" tape, where he wanted to take his 67 MLAs to form a new party ?

Try to answer the issue...What was Ashish Khaitan's role in writing this article which PB's is talking about..why wasn't it enquired into? Why are you shying away from such issues.? I can clearly see a disquiet in your camp..particularly Khaitan's theatrics on TV. Learn to address the issues. Do not adopt the tactic of a small politician who start shouting ho ho and attacks personally whenever he can't counter the opposition's arguments (which happens often!)...

In your introduction on top, you should immediately add  "and lost" after "national election". That completes your status.<br/><br/>
It should be the job of the debunk DC to give reasons for their actions.<br/><br/>
Why are you doing?Is it that they follow the instructions as chamchas without brain and then you look for suitable reasons postfacto.<br/>
Can you pls tell us how the cough has vanished or is it linked to muffler. You will be doing your first good service to the people, if you can reveal it.<br/>

                            Ashutosh, Nobody in the right mind would believe you. I think success has gone spectacularly to your heads. If you were to go to elections for Delhi today, you wouldn't even win 10% of the votes you had polled last time. There has to be always checks and balances in the system. Since you have more than 95% MLAs in Delhi, you think what AAP is doing today is correct. Absolutely ridiculous. <br/><br/>
You have already killed the people's movement and shattered the dreams of many Indians. Be rest assured you cannot win another term, if this is how you behave after getting a massive victory. Arvind's speech that he will rule Delhi and not look at other states, in his swearing in ceremony, is clear enough indicator that he has become just another politician without caring for the people's wishes. Now what is happening in the party reeks of total arrogance. <br/>
Wish the 'Right to Recall' was currently available in our electoral system.

                            I feel like Kejriwal robbed me of Rs.10,000 in broad daylight.  How can I get a refund?  Could someone set up a website where people can ask for refund?

                            Please stop Mr. Ashutosh, enough of making fool of us!! Stop talking about Swaraj, Anti Corruption etc. I was once a staunch volunteer of AAP, you guys have played with emotions of people like me, you guyz have buried the last hope any resurrection from the tyranny of Corrupt politicians. You guyz now proved to be more opportunistic and liars than the current lot of politicians.. I pity you!!!

                            ashutosh is the 'digvijay singh ' of AAP. anything for master . since the day people like ashutosh joined aap ,(were given lok sabha tickets straight away)all the people who really worked in anti corruption crusade have been sidelined. people who have followed indian politics in 90's will agree that there is massive similarities between rise and working of kejriwal and lalu mulayam gang. they both came to power through votes of poor ppl. they both sidelined all who can be equal to them in party. and wait very soon arvind will also like lalu be openly telling its my party and my kids will inherit it. its their right.

                            Dear Ashuthosh, People are very disappointed due to the happening in AAP.  We had too much expectations. Everything in water now. Being the follower of Mahatma, your leader Kejriwal should pardon these people and bring them back to mainstream. This is good for India and Aam Aadmi. If you do not listen to Aam Aadmi your party will die soon like Janata Party.

                            Asutosh and Co have to understand that in their public spat they are actually throwing dirt at each other and some to them is likely to stick. Prasanth Bhushan hits out at Ashish Khetan and in defending him you have hit out at Prasanth.  It could be that both of you are wrong or god forbid both of you are right and that means in the name of HMV being High Moral Value people you have been taking all the people for a ride.  Your fight is like asking one person - did you steal 5 crores and he retorts but you stole 10 crores - Ie both are thief's and it is the quantum stolen that is different.  The way you used or abused lokpal Admiral Ramdas also does not give us confidence that you will be able to give the people of Delhi a new sustainable system.

However I have a complain, It seems you don't read comments on your article. When you take time to write and we take time to read and write comment. You are duty bound to read!!! or Are you scared... shhhhh<br/><br/>
As I told you before, please change your picture. People expect a funny face when reading funny article.<br/>
Also please change profile summary, having lost against Harsh Vardhan in LS election is not a qualification you should highlight.<br/><br/>
Just to give you true picture of your skills/competency. You boss seems to have not even impressed as he has engaged Nagendar Sharma as media advisor, over looking you, an X- Editor in Chief!!!<br/><br/>
Your object is very clear. You want to be part of PAC and get an Rajyasabha seat from Delhi. So best way is to create vacancy. Given only 3 slot available best way is to reduce the competition, With PB and YY kicked out, you, Sanjay and Kumar now got sure shot. However you need to ensure you keep licking until early 2018, thats when there will be vacancy.<br/><br/>
I am pretty sure AAP and Arvind would also have faults, why don't you dare to write article on it one day.

                            To those who find Arvind Kejriwal credible should notice his double speak. In addition to going back on his every word in the past 2 years, the latest statement where he says that if AAP fulfils 40% of their promises, it would be great, bodes I'll for us Delhiites. Does this imply that his manifesto was all humbug and was just there to gather votes - reality doesn't matter? Food for thought hmm. And then there are these morons like the esteemed writer who defend him blindly and insulate him from reality.

They have no ethics and can not come close to PS or SS or YY. PS and SS are not selfish and they donated huge some of their money to start honest and corruption free party with high ethics for the future of our country and future of our next generation but It is sad that these corrupt chamchas and AK destroyed nation future. He is a one time CM, no matter how he runs Delhi government as no can trust him anymore. <br/>
Most amazing thing is AK is not saying any word and acting like innocent but he is in reality a mafia style leader whose Goondas destroyed AAP.
