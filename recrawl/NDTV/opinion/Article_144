Headline::::My White Neighbor Thought I Was Breaking Into My Own Apartment. Nineteen Cops Showed Up.



DateTime::::2015-11-19T13:00:00+05:30




                                On Sept. 6, I locked myself out of my apartment in Santa Monica, Calif. I was in a rush to get to my weekly soccer game, so I decided to go enjoy the game and deal with the lock afterward.
A few hours and a visit from a locksmith later, I was inside my apartment and slipping off my shoes when I heard a man's voice and what sounded like a small dog whimpering outside, near my front window. I imagined a loiterer and opened the door to move him along.
I was surprised to see a large dog halfway up the staircase to my door. I stepped back inside, closed the door and locked it.
I heard barking. I approached my front window and loudly asked what was going on. Peering through my blinds, I saw a gun. A man stood at the bottom of the stairs, pointing it at me. I stepped back and heard: "Come outside with your hands up." I thought: This man has a gun and will kill me if I don't come outside. At the same time, I thought: I've heard this line from policemen in movies. Although he didn't identify himself, perhaps he's an officer.
I left my apartment in my socks, shorts and a light jacket, my hands in the air. "What's going on?" I asked again. Two police officers had guns trained on me. They shouted: "Who's in there with you? How many of you are there?"
I said it was only me and, hands still raised, slowly descended the stairs, focused on one officer's eyes and on his pistol. I had never looked down the barrel of a gun or at the face of a man with a loaded weapon pointed at me. In his eyes, I saw fear and anger. I had no idea what was happening, but I saw how it would end: I would be dead in the stairwell outside my apartment, because something about me - a 5-foot-7, 125-pound black woman - frightened this man with a gun. I sat down, trying to look even less threatening, trying to de-escalate. I again asked what was going on. I confirmed there were no pets or people inside.
I told the officers I didn't want them in my apartment. I said they had no right to be there. They entered anyway. One pulled me, hands behind my back, out to the street. The neighbors were watching. Only then did I notice the ocean of officers. I counted 16. They still hadn't told me why they'd come.
Later, I learned that the Santa Monica Police Department had dispatched 19 officers after one of my neighbors reported a burglary at my apartment. It didn't matter that I told the cops I'd lived there for seven months, told them about the locksmith, offered to show a receipt for his services and my ID. It didn't matter that I went to Duke, that I have an MBA from Dartmouth, that I'm a vice president of strategy at a multinational corporation. It didn't matter that I've never had so much as a speeding ticket. It didn't matter that I calmly, continually asked them what was happening. It also didn't matter that I didn't match the description of the person they were looking for - my neighbor described me as Hispanic when he called 911. What mattered was that I was a woman of color trying to get into her apartment - in an almost entirely white apartment complex in a mostly white city - and a white man who lived in another building called the cops because he'd never seen me before.
After the officers and dog exited my "cleared" apartment, I was allowed back inside to speak with some of them. They asked me why I hadn't come outside shouting, "I live here." I told them it didn't make sense to walk out of my own apartment proclaiming my residence when I didn't even know what was going on. I also reminded them that they had guns pointed at me. Shouting at anyone with a gun doesn't seem like a wise decision.
I had so many questions. Why hadn't they announced themselves? Why had they pointed guns at me? Why had they refused to answer when I asked repeatedly what was going on? Was it protocol to send more than a dozen cops to a suspected burglary? Why hadn't anyone asked for my ID or accepted it, especially after I'd offered it? If I hadn't heard the dog, would I have opened the door to a gun in my face? "Maybe," they answered.
I demanded all of their names and was given few. Some officers simply ignored me when I asked, boldly turning and walking away. Afterward, I saw them talking to neighbors, but they ignored me when I approached them again. A sergeant assured me that he'd personally provide me with all names and badge numbers.
I introduced myself to the reporting neighbor and asked if he was aware of the gravity of his actions - the ocean of armed officers, my life in danger. He stuttered about never having seen me, before snippily asking if I knew my next-door neighbor. After confirming that I did and questioning him further, he angrily responded, "I'm an attorney, so you can go f- yourself," and walked away.
I spoke with two of the officers a little while longer, trying to wrap my mind around the magnitude and nature of their response. They wondered: Wouldn't I want the same response if I'd been the one who called the cops? "Absolutely not," I told them. I recounted my terror and told them how I imagined it all ending, particularly in light of the recent interactions between police and people of color. One officer admitted that it was complicated but added that people sometimes kill cops for no reason. I was momentarily speechless at this strange justification.
I got no clear answers from the police that night and am still struggling to get them, despite multiple visits, calls and e-mails to the Santa Monica Police Department requesting the names of the officers, their badge numbers, the audio from my neighbor's call to 911 and the police report. The sergeant didn't e-mail me the officers' names as he promised. I was told that the audio of the call requires a subpoena and that the small army of responders, guns drawn, hadn't merited an official report. I eventually received a list from the SMPD of 17 officers who came to my apartment that night, but the list does not include the names of two officers who handed me their business cards on the scene. I've filed an official complaint with internal affairs.
To many, the militarization of the police is primarily abstract or painted as occasional. That thinking allows each high-profile incident of aggressive police interaction with people of color - Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray - to be written off as an outlier.
What happened to them did not happen to me, but it easily could have. The SMPD sent 19 armed police officers who refused to answer my questions while violating my rights, privacy and sense of well-being. A wrong move, and I could have been shot. My complaint is not the first against the department this year. This spring, the local branch of the NAACP and other concerned residents met with SMPD to discuss several incidents of aggressive policing against people of color.
The NAACP asked SMPD for demographic information on all traffic, public transportation and pedestrian stops; so far, the department has promised to release a report of detailed arrest data next year.
The trauma of that night lingers. I can't un-see the guns, the dog, the officers forcing their way into my apartment, the small army waiting for me outside. Almost daily, I deal with sleeplessness, confusion, anger and fear. I'm frightened when I see large dogs now. I have nightmares of being beaten by white men as they call me the n-word. Every week, I see the man who called 911. He averts his eyes and ignores me.
I'm heartbroken that his careless assessment of me, based on skin color, could endanger my life. I'm heartbroken by the sense of terror I got from people whose job is supposedly to protect me. I'm heartbroken by a system that evades accountability and justifies dangerous behavior. I'm heartbroken that the place I called home no longer feels safe. I'm heartbroken that no matter how many times a story like this is told, it will happen again.
Not long ago, I was walking with a friend to a crowded restaurant when I spotted two cops in line and froze. I tried to figure out how to get around them without having to walk past them. I no longer wanted to eat there, but I didn't want to ruin my friend's evening. As we stood in line, 10 or so people back, my eyes stayed on them. I've always gone out of my way to avoid generalizations. I imagined that perhaps these two cops were good people, but I couldn't stop thinking about what the Santa Monica police had done to me. I found a lump in my throat as I tried to separate them from the system that had terrified me. I realized that if I needed help, I didn't think I could ask them for it.

                            A couple of decades back, when I was working in the US, it was common custom for people to come and greet a new next door neighbour with a newly baked cake or a bottle of wine. I suppose such things are done away with now, perhaps more so in a bustling metropolis. One could also reciprocate the same, without waiting for this introduction if one moves in new to an apartment complex. Such a precaution of introducing oneself would make sure that people around will know who lives there and avoid such misunderstanding.

                            The point made is that  what had happened has happened because she was colored and she was not ever offered a simple apology for the action by police, however well intended it might have been. And she was not provided with the full list of officers visited her apartment despite the promise made by one of the cops. May be it would take another 200 years for the whites in US to get over the race discrimination. Sad!

                            Its funny to see all the comments - you do know that Indians are seen as blacks in most of USA. remember the exact same thing happened to a Gujarati dadaji, only he ended up in hospital with severe injury after being tackled by the police. The report mentioned Hispanic who look very similar to us. Indians are also mistaken for Arabs and attacked. The lack of empathy and arrogance is the reason why the poor and even the lower middle class salaried people of India will reject supremacist parties and vote for social justice. I am 100% sure each of you support the idea of a hit ler dictator.

I call this such a BS! I live in LA and I've never heard of this news nor I've ever seen 16 cops being dispatched for a break in in the middle of the day. Blacks to love to cry racism and this is clearly a made up story. And cops didn't show up out of nowhere, here neighbors called them. So what's wrong with that?

                            Team, <br/><br/>
in reality those who lived in US , any 911 call <br/><br/>
1. Cops try to clear the spot and make sure no issues/risk. no complain will be taken lightly..(its very by police to police) and So without any answer to person they will do there duty. <br/><br/>
   ie: in a small fender bender accident (done by cops) I was sent to hospital for half a day of    <br/>
   observation and 100s of checks.     <br/><br/>
2. racism is everywhere and in each corner of the world. ( US/UK/India ....) which was one factor in this story. <br/><br/>
3. once they (Cop) found they done some mistake, they smartly cover it , which will put other party in fault or reasonable.<br/><br/>
Have a good one ....

                            The answer for this whole story lies in the line stated by the so called Victim -- How can one understand who is good or who is bad just by looking at them. <br/><br/>
" I imagined that perhaps these two cops were good people, but I couldn't stop thinking about what the Santa Monica police had done to me "<br/>
"As we stood in line, 10 or so people back, my eyes stayed on them. I've always gone out of my way to avoid generalizations."<br/><br/>
Is she not discriminating the police. Because those police behaved in that manner she is now looking at each police officer as bad ....

                            Sad that a country that considers itself civilised and defends "freedom &amp; liberty"elsewhere treats a huge proportion of citizens in this manner. This discrimination has been going on for such a long time and seems to have worsened in recent times. Coloured people are being shot at a drop of a hat. Far worse than a war-zone. It is also a telling comment on the intelligentsia of America that, inspite of having so many world renowned institutions, none of them have lent their voices to such a protest as was done recently in Indian, when many people voiced their protest and returned their awards when a few incidents occurred. Do their intellectuals have no conscience ?

                            This is sad and still shows how the colored people are perceived in the wild wild west!

                            Fay, I am from India but have lived in US for last 10 years. What you have described in the article is perfectly normal. You may draw sympathy when explained to an audience outside US. But i don't agree if you want to conclude racism behind this. not appropriate. Similar situation has happened with me. number of cops report for the issue , may be excessive. but depends on the neighborhood policy. Isn't it ?
