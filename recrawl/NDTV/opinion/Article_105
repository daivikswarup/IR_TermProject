Headline::::Modi Goes From Lion To Lamb On Pak



DateTime::::2015-12-27T14:24:00+05:30




                                The Great Showman has taken yet another turn upon the stage. By fetching up from Kabul in Lahore on his way back to India on the day we celebrate the birthday of Jesus Christ, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Nawaz Sharif - not to mention Good Governance Day! - Modi has certainly ensured that the spotlight remains on his highly personalized style of diplomacy.
Institutionalized foreign policy has given way to a cult of personality on which is stamped the imprimatur of one and only one man. This has short-term advantages - and damaging long-term consequences.
So, thank you for your last round of applause, ladies and gentlemen, but let us move from the last trick to a serious evaluation of the drama. That Modi stepped for a few moments on to Pakistani soil - albeit on a personal visit that has involved little beyond conveying birthday greetings to the Pak PM and blessings to his grand-daughter on the eve of her wedding - is not to be faulted. But can such a visit be taken as a benign visit by a fond uncle to his niece - or is there more to it than meets the eye?
Till just a few days ago we were being told no talks with Pakistan till it mends its ways. Specific conditions were being laid down for a dialogue to commence: return Tiger Memon; deport Dawood Ibrahim; tape up Hafiz Saeed's foul mouth; bung Zaki-ur Rehman Lakhvi back into jail; stop cross-border firing; end terrorism forever; and, above all, stop talking to the Hurriyat. Now, all of a sudden, with no progress on any of these fronts, Sushma Swaraj and Narendra Modi follow each other in quick succession to Pakistan.
What is going on? Do we have a policy towards Pakistan or just a series of improvisations?  
Just three months ago, in the last week of September, Modi was so frosty towards Nawaz Sharif that he would not even shake hands with him at the UN; a distant wave was all he could bring himself to do. Now, under a hundred days later, we see him embracing Nawaz Sharif. What explains the change? It was also only three months ago at the UN that Sushma Swaraj, denouncing Sharif's 4-point proposal for a way to peace, thundered that one point alone would suffice - end terrorism and we will begin talking. Pakistan has not ended terrorism but we are being treated by her to the homily, "Padosiyon se aise rishte hone chahiyen (these neighbourly relations are important)". Kaise rishte? Sitamabr ke rishte ya Disambar ke? (the September or December variety of relations?)
 
The only change that one can perceive in the last one hundred days is that Modi has met with Obama, Cameron, Hollande, Merkel and Putin. Each of them has rapped Modi on the knuckles and told him that he must resume discussions with Pakistan. So, under "advice" (read pressure) from those with wider chests than his own, Modi has buckled and started a dialogue process. Nothing else can explain this sudden transformation of yesterday's lion into today's lamb.
And this is most worrying. For if it is not of the government's own volition, but in an attempt to appease others that the dialogue is being initiated, with what confidence can one look forward to the dialogue leading to a permanent settlement? The problems between India and Pakistan are myriad. There is no quick or easy solution to any of them. Therefore, the single most important quality to bring to the talks is sincerity. Can sincerity be assumed in talks that were wiped off the agenda but a little while ago and are now apparently taking centre-stage? The other quality required is persistence. How long will talks imposed on us be continued without finding some excuse to break them off?
 
Our Foreign Minister has conceded that the talks should be "uninterrupted" but explicitly ruled out making the talks "uninterruptible". The prospect of interruption will hang like Banquo's ghost over the heads of the negotiators, especially as the question of the Hurriyat has not been squarely addressed. The background of "stop-start" is there in talks being initiated in May 2014 only to have them called off in August for specious reasons. Then came Ufa and the sleight of hand in trying to delink terror from Kashmir and to prioritize "Terror" over "Kashmir", only to suffer the blowback a month later. What we need is a structuring of the talks to make them "uninterrupted and uninterruptible". Till then, all dialogue is hostage to our accident-prone relationship with Pakistan. Some incident somewhere - and the game of snakes-and-ladders will bring us back to "Start".
Moreover, where should we begin? Where Dr Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf ended their backchannel talks in 2007 - or by reinventing the wheel? Nothing said by the successor BJP government indicates any acknowledgement of how far matters were moved between 2004 and 2007. The progress made is in the public domain as a result of Ambassador Lambah's speech in Srinagar on 13 May 2014 and Khurshid Kasuri's Neither a Hawk nor a Dove, published a few months ago. In any case, all the relevant papers are in the possession of the Prime Minister's Office. If good faith is not displayed in recognizing the achievements of the past, can we consider the new round as having been initiated in good faith?
Foreign policy cannot be conducted whimsically. It needs a clear enunciation of goals; the preparation of a strategy to arrive at the goals; a roadmap to show the way to the attainment of the goals; and tactical flexibility to factor in the unexpected as we go along. The inconsistency of the Modi government in its approach to Pakistan belies the absence of a strategy. The inconsistency displayed reflects the lack of a carefully thought out roadmap. The personalization of such policy as exists does not bode well for the institutional processes. National interest cannot be mixed up with the individual preferences of the high and the mighty. We have gone way beyond the stage where the Raja alone would decide questions of war and peace.
These are worrying concerns to have a fortnight before the Foreign Secretaries begin their long haul. And it is going to be a long haul, a very long haul indeed - calling for trust, patience, persistence, sincerity and dedication to longer-term national interests than passing, petty annoyances. Only time will tell whether India's suddenly altered Pakistan policy has truly been transmogrified - or whether, having shown the powerful world leaders that we have done their bidding, we revert to type and look for excuses to drag the dialogue back to its starting point.

With due respects to Mani Shankar Aiyyar, i request everyone to be quiet and not post comments on his blogs. His articles are logical only for him. At this rate, Congress will soon become history. <br/><br/>
Please move on with your work instead of reading his articles.<br/><br/>

Just last month you went to Pakistan and ranted on a news channel that the dialog with Pakistan must continue and the only way to do so was to get Congress back because Modi would never do it. You even begged the news anchor to help remove BJP from power, which was most hilarious and even caught the Pak news anchor by surprise.<br/>
Now when Modi's actually making that move, you are finding faults with him. You have no shame at all.

Mr. Mani, you pretty much summed up with your own attitude in that concluding sentence. What's the point of such writings with a pessimistic mindset deep down in your heart.<br/><br/>
What is Congress party's own foreign policy with Pakistan for all these years? Nothing significant, let it be the no. of soldiers fallen at the border or reducing tensions. I bet more soldiers might have fallen at the border in your regime than under any other regime even by pro-rate basis. All you guys kept saying for decades was talking talking ... i don't think other than eating few hundred biscuits and having several cups of tea nothing has been achieved that the common man of this country could make note of.<br/><br/>
Congress couldn't take bold steps such as Atalji or Mr. Modi. Instead was always happy sitting on the fence. By the way, who told you so categorically that you came to the conclusion Mr.Modi's so called show is the result of pressure from Big Nations? Is it RG?<br/><br/>
&gt;&gt;Foreign policy cannot be conducted whimsically. It needs a clear enunciation of goals; the preparation of a strategy to arrive at the goals; a roadmap to show the way to the attainment of the goals; and tactical flexibility to factor in the unexpected as we go along.<br/><br/>
Wow... agreed you wrote a wonderful definition of foreign policy, but don't you think something terribly is missing beyond that ... your own achievements against your own definition.. please enlighten us next time. Because, this generation is least interested in rhetoric.

His methods are unique to his own and we all are hopeful that it will bring about some change .. It is a shame that opposition parties in India only know how to oppose everything .. Same was the case with BJP also .. But I think the time has come to stand up and unite .. Hope your party realises it and starts to behave like a mature party...

Now coming to the matter itself this guy was telling the whole world only 2weeks before that of all the problems in the world,solving indo-pak conflict was the easiest to resolve.Now his article says it is very tough.Nobody ever told it is easy.Modi has started something and i should say even nawaz sharief.Perhaps not the conventional way .But conventional way in 70 years has not had much success.So such complex problems require out of box methods.To hell with this man.NAMO please go ahead and talk them out.The country is with you.

                            Mani Shankara Iyer is right . There have been too many flip-flops on dialogue with Pakistan, dialogue which the BJP, from the opposition flanks, had successfully stalled from proceeding further after 2008 almost accusing the UPA of treason. Should an average Indian assume that all that the BJP said against the UPA is also true against the BJP-as things demanded of Pakistan then have not been met even today by Pakistan? Cannot India's politicians have a coherence at least on foreign affairs? Is it a climb down for the ruling of whatever hue it may be to brief consult and brief the opposition on foreign affairs? When has ever foreign affairs been the focal point in any election, save , may be, Tamil Nad to a limited extent. The hectoring,self-righteous,we-know-everything,we-are -always right attitude of the BJP will boomerang on it sooner than later. All in all. a fine critique of India's Pakistan policy-if there is one, by the seasoned and hard-boiled foreign policy veteran Iyer

                            The problem is that this PM and in general this government is constantly addressing the audience which thinks style is a substitute for substance or bravado is a substitute for thoughtful behavior. So just as that audience claps uproariously to Modi's electioneering acronyms and other shenanigans which mean nothing, it claps for such so-called bold moves which two days after the event would mean nothing on the ground. Media, of course, plays its part with breathless commentators calling it rewrite of India Pakistan equation and what not.

                            Got it finally ,  Congress  should  have looped in Sajjan Jindal in the Indo Pak talks to avoid BJP's interruptions  in the peace talk process. Could  have  been  better   had Adani's business been considered  a priority ,  BJP/ Modi would have  even appreciated  the talks.

                            I just came to this page to let Mr Mani Shankar Aiyar know (if he does keep up with the comments on his op-ed pieces) that we don't care about your views anymore. I did use to read a few of his pieces initially, but, they turned out to be so devoid of substance and it was so easy to find the loopholes and propaganda in his (shadow writer's?) words that I've completely stopped reading him anymore. Haven't read a work of this particular piece either.<br/>
If the INC was trying to become irrelevant, they've succeeded. I believe that a strong opposition is an important counter-weight to the establishment, but, the INC, by it's sheer stupidity and self-centered attitude is making sure that isn't possible.

It is time that a team consisting of Rahul Gandhi, Mani Shankar and Shashi Taroor be sent to Pakistan to broker a permanent solution to peace. They have the magic to perform what is BJP and Mody is incapable of, in his  1 year in office. Or at least,  the trio can reveal their formula for a permanent solution instead Of 'opinions' in NDTV

It has been told to him by his bosses and he's simply playing puppet. I doubt he'll be so very critical of NaMo, the greatest and most statesmanlike PM India has had in decades, on a personal front.

                            Please publish this piece of mine as my earlier pieces on this moron and my charge that of holding NDTV responsible for encouraging this guy has been blacked out.Now coming to the main issue,why can't critics specially congress cannot understand the logic behind this kind of surprises.Normal straight channels and back channels have not been fruitful.A different approach is being tried.Whether this will bear fruit only time will tell.One thing is clear that Modi wants to isolate Hurriyat at this stage.In any case their behaviour betrays partisanship towards Pakistan.Then why not talk with Pakistan only.That is the reason most of the talks will happen outside India initially and later Hurriyat may be involved after both agree that they need to be part of the peace process.This seems to be the strategy,why can't critics see this and wait to see what happens.Mani was in our embassy in Pakistan ,what did he contribute.This is the reason I do not understand your publishing all his negatively oriented articles.

He has been doing this stupendously across the globe, but the bigger sugar and steel and gas lobbies lie in the neighbourhood. So he is just doing his duty to his neighbours.<br/>

Actually this psychological behaviour from MSIyer comes from the fact that he is used to a PM (like MMS) who is answerabke to a madam.

Good that Modi makes all such strategic moves by surprise and makes u guys think so hard on what would be his next isn't it? Completely und how u losers must be feeling. For now I think the foreign policy should be termed as transModified nit transmogrified! 😃

                            Does not matter what Modi does, this guy will never like it. I have seen bias but not to the extreme extent to which this guy takes it to. Time to grow up Mani.
