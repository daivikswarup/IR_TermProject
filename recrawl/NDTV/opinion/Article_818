Headline::::Newsroom: The Decision to Use a Dead 3-Year-Old's Photo On Air



DateTime::::2015-09-04T23:24:00+05:30



(The Newsroom, a new weekly column by Sonia Singh, NDTV's Editorial Director, focuses on the big news stories, how we covered them and why)
The rise and fall of a small chest as a child breathes in his or her sleep is a reassuring sight to parents anywhere in the world. At first sight, that's what little Aylan looked like he was doing, an exhausted child in deep sleep lying on a beach - it was the stillness of his chest that gave it away. The picture flashed on our computers in the newsroom at around 5 pm on Wednesday evening. The reactions even amongst our hardened, most cynical news journalists and editors who have witnessed gruesome, tragic events over the years (from bomb blasts to wars, cinema fires to starvation deaths) were instantaneous and heartfelt. How in a civilized world could this happen?
The accompanying headline from the news agency seemed almost bland and matter-of-fact in its description: '12 migrants killed off the Turkish coast as they attempted to escape Syria, among them 2 children.' Words that fell shamefully short of the tragedy of three-year-old Aylan.
It's a headline in fact that would almost certainly have never made it to the lead story of our news bulletins in normal course. The refugee crisis in Europe had been growing in the last few months, but seemed a distant story for Indian viewers and TV. Ironically, the sheer numbers of people trying to get into Europe, away from war in their countries, had actually reduced this to a story of faceless statistics. The news of over 40 bodies of refugees found in a truck on the weekend had been reported by NDTV, but as little more than a footnote in the focus on other 'breaking' stories like OROP, the Manipur tension, the Sheena Bora murder etc. In India, we joke, there's enough news generated every day to run a 48/7 news channel. More seriously, however, in a quest to tell the stories of a subcontinent, international news (unless it's India-Pakistan) often gets short shrift. A picture of a three -year -old boy changed that.     
At the news meeting that evening, where the top stories for prime time programs are discussed, there was rare unanimity. Our viewers may be more familiar with Sheena Bora than Syria, but it didn't matter. This image blurred national and international news borders. The verdict was unanimous, we must lead with this. The debate then moved to whether the picture may be too disturbing to use. As part of our broadcasting standards, we avoid showing bodies of dead people. In this case, however, we felt the impact would have been zero without the picture of Aylan's body. This wasn't about being ghoulish or voyeuristic, it was about not allowing our audience, a largely Indian one, to turn away from the reality of what is happening, albeit in a distant part of the world. We carried a warning with the picture but decided to go ahead. 
This was a story that was difficult for us to include in our debate shows precisely because the main cast of characters is so far away. It was however the lead in all our bulletins including the very prestigious prime time slot of 10 pm. Our correspondent in Paris, Noopur Tiwari, was commissioned to file a series of special reports from Paris to Calais. Aylan's death changed our perspective, making this a story of immediate news interest, worth investing time and resources in. As part of an extremely competitive world of newsbreaks in India, however, it interested me to see whether other Indian news channels or newspapers would do the same. The prominent ones I saw didn't, and perhaps when it comes to viewership figures, their call may well prove justified. 
I'm glad NDTV did though because I sense this picture will become as iconic as the one of a little girl with her skin peeling off her after a napalm bombing in Vietnam, a picture which changed the way the world viewed that war. The choice we made was mirrored in international news organisations. On Wednesday night, this picture united humanity across the globe.
The waves lapping at little Aylan's body changed the tide of public opinion. World leaders who had hardened their stands on the refugee crisis in the weeks leading up to this were forced to show a more humane side in the span of 24 hours. They had  little choice. From international football star Cristiano Ronaldo to Harry Potter creator JK Rowling to top band One Direction, reactions condemning government stands across Europe streamed in. From Australia to Canada, politicians said this death was 'unacceptable'. India so far has been silent.
 Aylan didn't die alone. Lying beside him on that beach was his five-year-old brother, a playmate in happier times. His mother also drowned with her children. The three of them united in death. Today, my grief is for the father who is alive. In interviews he talks of how he fought as his children slipped out of his hands. The abiding irony is that his son's story may have changed how the world views the refugee crisis in Europe, but it is too late to make any difference to him. A fitting tribute perhaps is not to let the stories of many other Aylans go unreported BEFORE it is too late. In India, I know we will be back to domestic news leading our TV rundowns soon, but this week at least, I'm glad NDTV told Aylan's story.

                            Tragedy has no boundries nor does it have any language. However, your intentions are genuine but reasoning has it's own agenda which doesnt sound like coming from heart since you had to back it up with comment from Ronaldo and JKRowling. Indians are more or less immune to such picture as we see children of India in reality. Anyways, lets hope innocent children do not have to suffer for all  horrible chaos thats been created in the name of peace.

                            Interesting that the onus seems to be on Europe alone, whereas Syria where the family comes from, Saudi who is bankrolling the war, and Turkey from where such illegal migrants were freely traveling etc are curiously out of the picture, discussion and criticism.

                            How come starving children in Africa over many decades never had this iconic effect on the collective psyche of Europe, or India for that matter? Lets face this uncomfortable truth: skin colors matter.

                            Muslims cries when one of their dies but they dont make noise when they kill innocents. They never integerate they always want their own way no muslim is patriotic for them religion comes first. Why its a news on India its middle east issue. We dont need them as refugee to start ISIS camp in India. Just because one of their kid dies it has become humanitarian issue what about those kids who have died due to Islamic terrorist bombing.

I saw the picks of these refugees entering Europe, women were mostly earing hijab etc.. They bring the same culture to Europe that has caused them all this pain.. Europe or any other world should ask them to leave in Islamic Land..

                            Self gloating. Smug in your insensitive reporting. Why use the distressing photo on the home page? It doesn't compare (not even close) with the ionic picture of the unfortunate Vietnamese girl. I would definitely now remember Sonia Singh for self righteously gloating over a totally unnecessary opportunistic use of a sad unfortunate event. Note to moderators: Use your common sense to moderate, and not block out any comment critical to NDTV news coverage.

                            NDTV should be complimented for this editorial judgment. Infact, I have a suggestion. NDTV should start a petition to PM Modi to sponsor Syrian refugees to India through a fund raising drive... telethon. This will put the Arab world to shame and stop the nonsense about the Govt being anti-muslim

                            Blunt and very agonising but sometimes that's what you need to wake up a sleeping world. I didn't like it but then I signed a petition to my local MP and parliament and donated for the cause. It made me act and as horrifying as it looked, the news served its purpose for me to capture the agony of another human being. Wonder what it would take for our leaders to act.

                            Millions of   Palearctic (European–African) long-distance migratory birds cross over from Europe to Africa.  Trans global movement of 'Life' is a natural phenomenon. The human race will learn its lessons with climate change when climatic catastrophes will wipe out millions near oceans or force people to move en mass to survive. Borders are artificial. No government has right to stop movement of people seeking survival.

                            Have to disagree with the statement "We carried a warning with the picture but decided to go ahead."<br/><br/>
Perhaps a warning could have been put in bold in the banner allowing people to carefully, cautiously &amp; consciously to decide if they still wanted to view and read the article - But unfortunately, the picture was coming up in the face when you land on the website as the top story and it was very very disturbing to see it(Well, you don't have to show a toddler's dead body picture with the face to show the cruelty.) This I don't think was done with good intention, but only to sensationalize the news !!

                            The image is disturbing but so many unnecessary deaths happen all over the world as well. I also think there is a lot of politics behind it as the media is trying to force the EU to yield and take moe immigrants. But is EU responsible for this situation. Why are not Arab countries, which will support rogue nations like Pakistan on Kashmir, form an army and fight against ISIS. instead they are fighting Assad, Kurds and playing petty politics. And if Islamic culture is such a great culture  why are not the refugees going to the promised land of Saudi arabia?<br/><br/>
I am worried about the changing demographics of eu. Like it has happened in Assam, these refugees will come now with desperation and afterwards they will form ghettos and refuse to integrate with the rest of the society. You are going to see veiled women and bearded men in every city. They want the wealth of Europe but will consider their culture inferior.<br/><br/>
The EU should act tough else it will be too late.

                            I don't see them as normal refugees. They look well dressed and equipped with more than the basic needs. They intentionally escape the refugee camps in Jordan. Did Jordan deny food and living? They misuse the crisis to simply enter into EU. In broader picture, I believe they well deserve for their greediness. Why cry foul when their plans go wrong?

We have become so indifferent to the apathies of those we havent met that their lives or their deaths are just headlines. Salutes to NDTV for bringing this awareness to India and this is a finely written column indeed. All I hope is that mankind becomes kind again and such incidents, no matter what race or religion, never happen again. RIP little angel.
