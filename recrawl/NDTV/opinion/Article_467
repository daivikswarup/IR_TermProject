Headline::::This Could Be The Congress's Sanjeevani Moment



DateTime::::2015-03-23T19:02:00+05:30




                                
	(Nur Laiq is Visiting Researcher at Georgetown University, School of Foreign Service. She worked for the Congress on the general election campaign in 2014.)Sanjeevani is the life-infusing plant with which Hanuman brought Lakshmana back from near death. Jairam Ramesh, former Rural Development Minister, believes that the land campaign could work the same sanjeevani magic for the Congress as Chikmagalur did in re-launching the party in 1978. The Congress is fighting the BJP's land ordinance both in Parliament and on the streets. Last week, Sonia Gandhi led an opposition protest in Delhi and the party has also held numerous farmers' meetings, a padyatra and two dharnas at Jantar Mantar.
	Jairam Ramesh may just be right. And not because the sanjeevani herb can be found in the Aravalli Hills skirting Delhi. But because something turned at Jantar Mantar, where I attended the recent protests against the land ordinance, one organized by Anna Hazare and the other by the Congress. There, I witnessed a reversal of roles between Anna and Congress - a metamorphosis of legitimacy.
	Anna owned that trump card in 2011. His anti-corruption dharnas struck a chord. His words, with their Gandhian overtones, demanded a call to action. But this time around at Jantar Mantar, most of the day passed by in farmers being called up to the stage to touch Anna's feet. Anna Time had become Pranam Time. His spiel sounded stale, running along the lines of: "Farmers haven't suffered such injustice since British rule. Inqilab zindabad." Congress, on the other hand, could talk straight to the issue. The 2013 Land Act was, after all, passed following two years of consultations both across parties and the country. It had the support of the opposition, including the BJP, in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.
	This month, Anna plans to embark on a padyatra or march to gather support for a Jail Bharo Andolan, which he will bring back to Delhi's Ramlila Maidan in the summer. There is only one flaw in this. These are the months when the rabi crops, such as wheat are harvested, followed by the kharif season, when paddy sowing starts. I doubt any farmer will have the free time either to go to Delhi or to jail.
	In contrast, Congress has outlined its plan to take the battle to the fields. But it requires more to get to a sanjeevani moment, Chikamagalur style. For that, not only did Indira Gandhi hold a grueling 7-8 rallies a day, she also managed to pin down the Janata government on the gap between its soaring rhetoric and relatively lackluster delivery. The Aam Aadmi Party won Delhi in February by tapping into that same vein vis-a-vis Modi.
	Kejriwal held countless people's assemblies and focused relentlessly on addressing the difficulties of people's everyday lives. In the outer Delhi constituencies, he zoomed in on the issue of land acquisition, listened to farmers' grievances and vowed that they would be protected from predatory land grabs. AAP is now taking the fight to Haryana, where it is connecting it to the BJP's other anti-farmer policies such as the raising of fertilizer prices and the reduction of the minimum support price. AAP combined the local with a larger idea - one of a new political culture based on accountability. It got Kejriwal Delhi, but he does not have India.
	The opposition political space today is tight. The land rights issue, once owned by Congress, is now being co-opted by other parties. But none of them, from AAP to the regional parties have an organizational reach that is countrywide. Congress' organizational machinery might be sclerotic, but it exists. The party is currently in the process of revamping its PCC (state-level) committees. Taking the land fight to the villages provides an opportunity to renew the links between grassroots workers and the state leadership. It could be used to revive the block and district committees and to connect with local concerns.
	The land ordinance also offers Congress the chance to re-seize the narrative. The land issue is not about farmers vs industry, but about inequality and inclusiveness. Other opposition parties have already used this to position themselves as defenders of the disenfranchised but they don't have ten years of progressive legislation to back them up. This was evident at Jantar Mantar, where Anna and Kejriwal could talk up land rights, but did not have an ideological framework within which they could place it.
	Can Congress use this moment to lay out a vision for development that moves beyond the binaries of industrialists and farmers, urban and rural? The last few years have seen a wave of movements across the world based on people's aspirations not just for development but also a desire for dignity. This is where the idea of inclusive development comes in, where an emotional connect can be made and where legitimacy matters. The sanjeevani vidya lies here. The question is which political party will be able to use it.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            What an utopian dream of reviving a dead buffallo and that too with an Italian mafia leader heading the campaign.Instead our pappu should campaign with his donkeys and mules in congress and ask for beehives.Madam congress is dead and no power on earth will be able to revive it as it has dug its own grave .Opposing Land reform bills is not going to cut an ice with the rural folks as barren land is not going to solve the hunger of our farmers.If sonia is trying to act smart and fool the poor farmers then congress will loose whatever influence is left in place like kerala or karnataka.There is no dearth of advisors in congress and all of them are sitting in ivory tower with out any touch with reality.India badly need congress free nation and even the vestige of congress history shoukld vanish from this country

                            So the crux is: "Indian Politicians and Public".......economics and rationality should take back seats and emotions should take the front seat even if the emotions keep us backward for another 100 years. You are right it is now time for congress to play with emotions or use the land bill as Sanjeevani...

                            Media gave anna more time than that was due and they needed a reason to assess the chord with national mainstream population once at least.... Now they have gone to resurrect the grand old party , coz, the party's survival will be their survival and source of bonus, grants, padma awards etc for the rest of their professional life...So they have gone back to put in a last ditch effort to revive the GoP of India so that they can survive...

                            Modiji lost his credibility in the eyes, mind and heart of people of India within short time with this Land Aquisition Act Ordinacne or Bill.<br/>
People of India immediately judge the intentions and motive of the Government who misuse power and joins hand with Aristrocrats and exhibits the Autocratic Leadership. <br/>
It was not expected with Mr.Modi will loose popularity soon within first of year of his Governance. Interestingly none of his Ideological Companion from Ideological Organization has any expertise on Rural India or Agriculture Community how they think and how this farmers class micro-economics worked.

                            What did Gujarat propaganda did? It made many indifferent Hindus talk, form opinions and become 'bhakts'.Why because when you talk, debate,eventually, truth filters out.This time also, truth is with our PM.The bill propaganda will stir indifferent village youth into debate.There will be supporters and there will be opponents.The supporters will win.But for BJP,these opinionated supporters of the bill will be the new recruits, from a constituency where it had very little presence.Congress is making another mistake like gujraat propaganda.It's only remaining voter base is about to be polarized.

                            Wrong analogy.<br/><br/>
You've got Rahu at the top forcing Halahal down everyone's throats, and his mother, Simhika refuses to stop him.<br/><br/>
Hanumanji is successfully bursting Simhika's head open, and has also captured Rahu in his armpit, whilst delivering Sanjeevani to Bharat (varsha).

                            Nur your research is half baked. No Party in India is ready for a discussion on Land Bill. Sonia and others can bark but when they to Public they have to explain what is what of the bill which nobody knows. Even Sonia has not read it so not ready to discuss.  So please don't go so down to state it as a Sanjeevani. You have to read history properly plus current affairs too.

Mr. Modi Slavery Model will change India into two classs landless labourers working in Influential Wealthiest Land Owners from Business Community. Previously same farmers were working in their own land but later they will work in own land accquired by Wealthiest Business Community.

                            I am not sure why people think Hazare is some sort of beacon lighting the conscience of India.  He hasn't got what it takes to guide India to prosperity!  His is a pot-bellied, short sighted old man, way past his sell  by date and is at best, a nuisance.  His Gandhian ideas may have been relevant in Gandhi's time; they are certainly not relevant in modern times when India faces external threats from nuclear armed Pakistan and nuclear armed China, not forgetting threats of millions of Bangladeshis migrating into India to take advantage of the little progress we have made.  Hazare was a mediocre Army driver.  That is the extent of his knowledge of the world.  The people who came forward to touch his feet are stupid and deserve to remain where they are as far as development is concerned.  The fact that Sonia Gandhi is giving Hazare any sort of credence shows the opportunistic low life that she is; she will do anything, however dishonest, to regain power.  India spoke against this sort of behaviour in May 2014.  I expect a repear performance.

 *sanjeevani* cannot work with Congress as Congress party looks like a corpse which means it is already beaten to death !<br/>

                            It takes more than few protests. In Kerala Congress is supporting a corrupt finance minister. In Karnataka, Congress ka Haath was Mafia ke Saath, in a recent case. There probably may be opportunity if BJP Government does not get its act together, but it will be sad, a repeat of another coalition government or government without accountability. Congress should choose a totally new leader who can think middle of the road. Country is no longer stuck in poverty, populism, quotas and minority appeasement. AAP did wellt to reject support by Shahi Imam. Can congress get out of its minority grid-lock?

                            during the last agitation at Jantar mantar by Anna against there was no farmer support at all, it's only on the second day<br/>
That AAP  from Harayana and congress/SP from UP on payment, arranged a few thousand so called farmers. Actually one of the Hindi news paper published statement of many agitators with address and photographs that they were bought here promising giving them land.<br/>
Therefore, it's difficult to say whether this agitation will work as sanjivani for the already sunk congress, further Modi is a shrewd strategist not like Kapil, PVC etc of congress who handled Anna's anti corruption agitation.

                            so it is actually the interest of the survival of congress which is more important than a detail study of the pros and cons of the land bill. Every bill has its pros n cons - it depends who it helps - the farmers vs the capitalists ... but to exploit it for the political purposes is what is bad for the country.

                            Time and again Modi is requesting an open discussion, asking opposition parties to show the shortcomings in his land bill but no takers . Is it that the Congress and other opponents of the proposal are not confident or is it that they are scared of losing "Sanjeevani opportunity " when they get exposed? In days to come when Congress tries to pursue and Anna joins the gang, the bubble will burst one way or the other. Modi will not give up so easily  it looks like. Can a weakened lady abandoned by her son and with demotivated generals take on the task ?
