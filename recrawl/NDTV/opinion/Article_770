Headline::::A Pyjama Party? Rahul Gandhi Still Doesn't Get It



DateTime::::2015-08-19T15:16:00+05:30




                                Sometime in 2010, while traveling to report from interior Maharashtra on the atrocities against Dalits, I came across a Dalit poet who had been arrested by the police for provoking Maoist ideas through his poems. During his interrogation in Nagpur, he was asked by a cop "Since when have you neechi zaat walas (lower caste people) started wearing suit-pants? You think you will be the next Ambedkar."
Babasaheb Ambedkar, the father of the Indian constitution, who fought hard for the upliftment of Dalits, used his suit as a sign of liberation from the age-old repression of Dalits, he used it as a symbol of a new India where the Western ideas of equality, fraternity, liberty would trounce the invidious caste system.
Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi who delivered the "suit boot ki sarkaar" phrase during the Budget session of parliament with considerable success decided to go a step further yesterday. While interacting with villagers in his constituency, Amethi, he said what was needed - and on offer by him was a 'kurta pyjama sarkaar' for the common man.
In his conversation where he spoke to villagers about bringing back the 'chappal wali (slipper) sarkaar' was the glaring answer to why the BJP, led by Narendra Modi, has so effectively sidelined the Congress, whose leaders appear to still be groping in the dark for the causes of their defeat. Rahul Gandhi may want to be seen as a jhola-wala and  chappal-wearing leader, but forgets that our huge young population has moved on - or is desperate to do so. According to a UN report of 2014, with 356 million 10-24 year-olds, India has the world's largest youth population .
 
A population that 45-year-old Rahul Gandhi is unable to connect with at all sorts of levels. While Narendra Modi wore jade-blue dapper suits for parts of his different campaigns, Rahul Gandhi appeared uninspiring cutting archaic cloth for the lackluster kurta-pyjama. While Modi spoke about getting foreign investment for India, tapping the potential of a surging youth population that dreams big and works hard, Rahul Gandhi appeared trapped in dated symbols of politics, which the new middle class of India refuses to identify with and wants to break away from.
There is also an inherent hypocrisy when Gandhi, who does not shy away from featuring with the elite at society parties, mocks those who wear "suit-boot" or branded attire. While there is absolutely nothing wrong in wearing the kurta-pyjama or the chappal for the sheer comfort it offers, positioning it as the uniform at a time when urban India's "dil maange more" disenchants many. More importantly, the construction labourer and the farmer of the new India want to wear the shirt pant too, with belts and whistles; the new India wants to modernize and reap the benefits of that progress, compete aggressively with other countries for a larger place in the sun. If that is the idea that Rahul Gandhi is mocking, then he has (again) got his basics wrong. He should note Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, who was attired in "suit boot", succeeded in bringing the Dalit and backward classes to the mainstream.
 
If Gandhi wants to be seen as a Leftist, a trade union leader who sometimes accessorizes with a stubble or wears "pant-shirt" when he meets the students at FTII to show he's with them, he must understand that much more is needed to tap into the youth. The Left saw a decline for its refusal to accommodate the ambitions of a new India, its refusal to reinvent itself. One cannot deny that the Left has provided a moral and ideological tilt to a lopsided Indian economy and polity, and that from Indira to Sonia Gandhi, senior Congress leaders have heavily borrowed themselves from the Left ideology. 
 
Yes, the Manmohan Singh government was forced to include pro-poor decisions influenced by the Left parties which supported it and which led to another term in office in 2009. But by wearing a "coat-pant", Modi did not end up alienating the vote of the rural and poor India. Gandhi should be willing to face the fact that young voters of the country were more inspired by a rather hep 63-year-old Modi, who spoke their language, than a then 43-year-old Gandhi whose ideas were out of synch with a country hooked to mobile phones and a determination to look forward.
As Prime Ministerial candidate, Modi proved he could be all things to all people - he was the chaiwala who worked his way to the top, a leader who would use Skype chats and the latest in technology to address not just urban but rural masses, transporting them to the promise of a future gleaming with technology and its potential. On the other hand, Gandhi was the leader of a party that seemed stuck in a time warp with its talk of fighting neo-liberalism and the pro-imperialist approach of the ruling class. The sort of jargon which makes the India of today yawn while checking its mobile phone for the latest.
Rahul Gandhi, you are 45, and you are finally somewhat on Twitter, and you now see that selfies - that Modi trademark - all work to "youthify" you. But embrace modernity in your thoughts and remember that a developing , aspirational India doesn't want a kurta-pyjama, but is also confident that it is not mocking its roots and traditions by wearing a pair of boots.

                            Rana, I will give you 9 our of 10 for exposing  Pappu for what he is, namely, a hypocrite who will attach himself to any cause as a 'rent a cause' accoutrement! I would have given you 10 out of 10 had you mentioned the following: 1. Great-great-grandfather Motilal had his suits made in Savile Row, then as now the most expensive bespoke tailors in the world.  Said Motilal even ordered a special suit from Savile Row for the Delhi Darbar welcoming King George V of England and had his shirts laundered in Paris.  2. Great-grandfather Jawaharlal also had his suits stitched in Savile Row. 3. Grandmother Indira wore the most expensive sarees money could buy. 4. Daddy Rajiv and Mumma Sonia were up to date with the latest fashion trends in the West and for most of their lives adapted to those trends. 4. The average kurta-pyjama wearing 'aam aadmi' would not be able to take a 2 month holiday for vipasna in any exotic destination. 5. The average kurta-pyjama wearing 'aam aadmi' could not possibly afford the medical treatment Mumma Sonia gets in the best hospitals in the USA.<br/><br/>
In short, who is this turd trying to kid?

                            Pappu's Amethi trip shows whats wrong with Congress and why they need to abandon pappu if they want to survive. You can't miss the symbolism of the 1980's at work during his visit.<br/><br/>
A prince goes to a village stricken with poverty, mingles with commoner's. A kurta pyjama clad old man is privileged enough to sit next to the prince as he talks about kurta pyjama sarkar. The prince also walks with commoner's and visits a shop where he has some snacks made in the most unhygienic manner showing how even though he is a prince, he still lives as a common man.<br/><br/>
All these went out in the 1980's. India today does not want their 'leader's' to hand them down things. This attitude of 'I am a prince and i am here to see your problems which i will solve by giving you people freebies' will not work.<br/><br/>
What the people of Amethi should ask him is why after 60 years of being re-presented by the first family of India, many years having the PM of the country as their MP are they still in kurta pyjama? <br/><br/>
Why in 10years the only person that moved from kurta pyjama to suit boot was Robert Vadra while the common folks of Amethi are still in kurta pyjama and chappal's after 60 years.<br/><br/>
Sadly, the Gandhi's have kept the people of Amethi illiterate, poor and not capable of demanding answers. The kurta pyjama clad people make life easy for Gandhi's and that is why they want us all to always be clad in kurta pyjama.

                            Rahul Baba, I understand that you want to appeal to a more baser and a larger constituent of Indian populace, which is that of a group wearing pyjamas and chappals as against a smaller group of people wearing soots &amp; boots. <br/><br/>
I have a better suggestion!!! What is perhaps common with both groups of people is that they all wear Longots/Underwears. I think you should consider projecting yourself as Longotiya Paksh/Underwear Party. This way you will appeal to soot boot group as well as Pyjama &amp; Chappal group. What say you buddy? Surprisingly, Underwear Party's acronym is UP, looks more crisper than UPA ;-)

Right now, he has been completely taken over by team of professionals (!!), who writes scripts, decides locations, lighting and calls cameramen (You may read 'Media') before calling action. He is trying to abide by script. At least I will not blame him for any failure, or will credit him with success (in case !). Everything belongs to his Managers / directors. So pls. blame or credit them. Mr. Rahul is as innocent as it were before couple of decades. Just an actor... nothing more... nothing less. Pls. rate accordingly.

If Indians don't realise this fact quickly, we are heading back to 1950s in that same pace.

                            In a pre election interview for all questions by the anchor RG was replying women empowerment and RTI. He did not know anything except these two subjects. Probably his tutor taught only so much. Now the tutor must have taught Suit boot ki sarkar. Now he keeps chanting the same words whereever he goes.  Dr. Ambedkar, Jawharlal Nehru, Rajiv Gandhi and Manmohan Singh were all dressed in suit boot. According to RG they are all incapable because of their dress sense and he is right because he can't wear suit boot. This is a borrowed idea from Kejriwal who won the election wearing an old mufler.  Such appeals work once and not always. RG beware it will boomarang on you if you continue to use these words since people of repute both past and present use suit and boot and every poor person wants to own one as early as possible.

Well they still have empty slogans to poor, or fear mongering about capitalism and businesses and mislead the poor to chase away industries and *JOBS*and remain jobless, poor, and dependent on leftists polpoliticians for MNREGA handouts. So they will keep voting for them just to keep the charity/dole coming.

                            This is one of the fine blog which has potential to change the Congress if they wish to do. First they need to change their leader, who cant scale and surely cant measure up to the experienced administrator such as Modi. Second, they need to democratize the party so that new leaders have hope to raise. Third, they must detail the vision for India which is based on progressive thinking than just saying that we will make every one poor. Forth, they need to build new net work with industries to ensure election funding is tide well. Unfortunately Congress not got this right for past 10 years and don't see they will get it right next 10 years.

Even after such electoral defeat. Apparently, Congress is adamant and refusing to do a reality check or otherwise they would have elected an appropriate leadership, if internal party democracy is practiced, and they would have done away with that Family.<br/><br/>
It is only a matter of time before Congress is going to become completely irrelevant and a national-level clone of DMK (Not a political outfit but a Family Welfare Fund). <br/>
People won't even see them as a political party anymore.

                            Must have been very difficult for Ms Ayub to write a piece in which she has to, by default, praise her bete noire, Mr Modi. Slowly, but surely, the mediocre Rahul Baba, is leading the Congress to it's inevitable oblivion. It is rather unfortunate that such a major political party, which was in the forefront of our independence struggle, has to survive, post independence, by clinging on to the coat tails of one family. Mr Modi and the BJP have a great friend in Rahul; everything about Mr Modi shines in comparison to the shallow and drab personality and character projected by Rahul. And mind you, he is the chosen PM candiate of not only his party; but the Modi haters which comprise a large section of our Lutyens intellengentsia and media. The author grudgingly admits that the youth of India are seeing through the sham, this Rahul Baba is.

                            The author is right. Gandhis and congress are hitting the wrong note with people of India and the reason for that is very simple. Their full attention is how to grab power in next general elections, rather than thinking of how to develop the country and living standard of people. This is what they have done in last 60 years. Divide and Rule.

                            Ironically, the man who built and contributed a huge chunk of its early success (Zero now) to the Congress party, Mahatma Gandhi wore neither a Suit Boot nor a Kurta pajama, once he entered the nitty gritty of the fight for freedom. No Congress government has survived without patronage from Industrialists and rich business. All this talk is mere gibberish and only shows Rahul's amateurishness.

                            What is the purpose of publishing this opinion?. Buttering up Modi? or diverting attention from present governance?? Selfies are nobody's trademark millions do it everyday and use twitter too... Weather Modi and Rahul choose to use selfie,twitter, suit, boot, kurtha or pyjama is not our country's problem. This is clearly politically biased opinion and not addressing any serious issue and the author appears to be an individual with personal motive than a professional journalist or writer. Congress no longer runs the Govt. Instead of obsessing with Rahul, tell us how and what is present Govt. doing??

                            What a surprise! Ayyub gave up Modi bashing and started bashing Rahul Baba! Anyway, better late than never. Keep up the good work, and you may finally succeed. One thing Ayyub forgot. The kurta pyjama is now discredited wear. Every crooked and criminal politician wears it. If you want to show that you are an honest politician who has arrived, you wear something different. See Modi, Prabhu, Naidu and Parrikar. That is the way to go, if you want to connect to young India. All Congressmen still wear pristine white kurta pyjamas. And the public see them for what they are - corrupt crooks trying to hide their black deeds under spotless white clothes.

                            More than connecting with youth, I think Rahul must accept that they are asked by people to sit aside and watch how the country could be run. I think he can also make into a good leader by focussing on the core issues and not just always be bashing Mr Modi. Opposition is not just being anti person, it is filling gaps that could remain even when Govt has the best intentions to do well..they can bring attention to the Govt about a state left out, or a particular society left untouched by Govt. Expecting Modi to fulfil BJP promises in a year, while you could not do even in 60 years, is quite unfair. And people will see through this unfair means of trying to get in limelight

                            Modi's suit boot is not in sync with his ideology. He wants old vedic culture, tradition and thinking to be adopted by all or enforced on all and at the same time wants to make a show of modernness. His mindset of persecuting anyone who does not agree with him or persecuting the whole community and those who are not Hindus like it happened in Gujarat are way apart from democratic ideas of modern world, which he does not believe in. Dictatorship, persecution, communalism and spreading hatred in the community are stone age ideologies. Changing clothes does not make one modern.

                            I get the feeling that Rahul Gandhi is trying to fight the elections of 1970s when Indira Gandhi spoke about "Garibi hatao". The current youth is not happy just not being poor (garib) only. They have bigger aspirations. I dont think he gets that and all his campaigns are designed to drive that message... thats why he is not connecting with the people. And even if he changes that, I dont think he has it in him to be an inspirational leader... Of all the Congress men I have seen... Perhaps Sachin Pilot seems most competent.. Dont think Rahul Gandhi can inspire confidence..

                            Rahul Gandhi is all noise without any substance. It will do him good to renounce politics and try to find a suitable life partner before it is too late. Of course, the poor guy had no choice, as he was thrust into politics, because he happened to be born in the Nehru-Gandhi family. However, now, the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty does not have as much sway in Indian politics as it did, say, a decade or two ago. People are not enamoured just by a family name or fair skin as they did earlier. With Obama becoming the President of the USA, and doing not badly, it has had repercussions everywhere. No longer do the people of India clamour to have a fair skinned individual to head their country. <br/><br/>
If Rahul Gandhi ever where to become India's Prime Minister, or powerful enough to call the shots behind the scenes as his mother did when Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister, it will be a repeat of the disaster which happened during his mother's reign. Rahul Gandhi does not have any deep ideology or beliefs or commitment behind him. Power has been thrust on him, and unfortunately the people of India have started seeing through the behind the scenes games nowadays.<br/><br/>
 Narendra Modi, for all his faults, does have some commitment to bettering the country and its people. His days in the RSS and BJP have also inculcated a sense of nationalism and ideals. This has not been the case with Rahul Gandhi. Of course, one feels sorry for him, but he will do well to exit India's political arena and search for better pastures elsewhere.

                            In US we have a Rahul Gandhi in the name of Donald Trump whose only name to fame is to benefit (and encourage) from the anger against the establishment but are unable to provide serious policy options on how to remove specific inefficiencies and biases from an entrenched system of governance. Until I as a voter hear such ideas, especially from leaders inexperienced in political governance, it seems safer to support somebody with a track record, even if she/he does not deliver everything we asked for. Of course in the case of Rahul Gandhi the entrenched system of (mis)governance is mostly a Nehru-Gandhi legacy, which I doubt he will ever challenge politically.

                            I think the author is over-interpreting the literal meaning of "suit-boot"...true it means the PM and ministers are wearing suits and boots but RG only intended to use those words to hint at the fact that " they are set out to work hard for the masses whereas they are enjoying at the taxpayer's expenses"...and when RG uttered "kurta-pyjama" he is implying a more sincere and humble personality who would be more interested in doing the job than showing off...perhaps the author may be correct in implying that the present-day youth are more interested in smelling the coffee rather than looking at the content inside the cup - true but in order for the PM and his safron cult to retain the loyalty of that youth they need to deliver closer to the promises they have made otherwise they will lose the trust over time and unless they deliver the  "suit-boot" with modernly appearance will not appeal to the youth any more...the youth wd not turn out to vote at every election unless the govt keep their word - just see what happened in the recent elections !!

                            Innovating with authenticity is what Modi is doing. That is because he is an insider to the tradition. Rahul is an outsider unfortunately. So he clings on to the trivials as the signs of authenticity. Why is Modi's modernity authentic while Rahul's attempts at appearing a son of the soil unconvincing ?<br/><br/>
Western scholars studying Hinduism do the same. As outsiders they do not understand the essence of Hinduism. They clutch at the superficial and brand themselves as authentic and modern Hindus as NEo Hindus. Swami Vivekananda can connect Hinduism to modernity with great legitimacy. That is the same phenomenon at play

Being a congress VP it is his duty to emulate Mahatma and show to the world that he means upliftment of downtrodden. His father always wore Suit and so was a part of Suit Boot Government. To go further all Congress men should wear only loin cloth like Mahatma as a uniform. Then they are sure to win all forthcoming elections.

if the point is to create a political alternative, then I don't think you have to wait longer. Shrewd Congress guys will throw him away soon if he can't deliver results.Which he certainly can't.

                            Well the problem with "Pappu" is he or anyone from his family never worked for living unlike any other ordinary Indian. If he did he would not have found it strange if somebody wore a suit or a pyjama. No work makes "Pappu" not just dull boy but also made him the dumbest boy at 41 in India.

                            In general, people get stomach ache if their maid wear good clothes and that is human nature you will find it everywhere. Actual there was law in pre-independence era to ensure caste based dress code. However, there is no use of such interpretation as Darbar is very much full and reserved for many, many coming years so, question of new entry does not arise. The real question is whether we will be able to even in a position to purchase Chappal in future as we have down the reverse gear and there is no brake. Whatever, some resistance one may find here and there will not survive in an environment of inequality and discrimination. At least there was legal right to wear a Chappal in socialism but capitalism is a one way traffic it will only take from you without any return and if you ask your share then you will get boot.

                            She is supposed to be a writer, doesn't she understand 'Metaphor'?  Ah.."Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer. She is working on a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which will be published later this year.)"   That explains !

                            Rana stick to these kind of articles - people can accept and read and understand. Usual Modi bashing doesn't go well with a progressive mentality of today's youth and Nationals.

                            So Mr Rahul Gandhi does not want to include Bengalis(  there is no need for West Bengal.. The state should be renamed as BENGAL as there is no other Bengal now) and South Indians who don't wear pajamas.
