Headline::::What I - And Apparently, Delhi - Have Against Kiran Bedi



DateTime::::2015-02-10T16:14:00+05:30




                                
	(Shobhaa De is an established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator, who is considered an authority on popular culture.)
	It was that ice cream pink Pathan Suit that did Kiran Bedi in! I mean... PINK? Seriously? By then, the voter had made up his/her mind - Delhiwallas were okay with mufflers of various hues. But strictly no Pink Pathan Suits for their Chief Minister. This is where the eminent Judge saab Makarandey Katju enters the picture. He had voiced a theory earlier (and everybody had slammed him for making such a blatantly sexist remark) that Shazia Ilmi deserved the BJP nomination far more than Kiran Bedi. He had taken it upon himself to convert the election into a Miss Delhi beauty contest and confidently stated that had Narendra Modi/Amit Shah/Arun Jaitley (not necessarily in that order) picked looks and youth over experience and age, Shazia Ilmi would have walked away with the nomination - and possibly, won!
	But the Big Boys of the BJP picked Kiran Bedi.
	Nothing wrong with picking Ms Bedi. Or.... or.... everything wrong! For one, it seemed like a manipulative and cold-blooded decision, given the history of that relationship. For another, once she had the coveted nomination in her pocket, Kiran Bedi picked up her old service revolver and shot herself in the foot... when she wasn't shooting her mouth off, that is! This was so cringe-making that even old buddy Anna Hazare refused to take her calls!
	Heady with the new opportunities staring her in the face out of the 'rosy blue', Kiran went to town, making a total ass of herself as she heaped praise on ex-foe Narendra Modi. This was not the best move - and voters looked for the nearest bush behind which to puke ("His is the most beautiful face in the world..." etc etc). Picking Kiran and aggressively projecting her as the Chief Ministerial candidate was Modi's most obvious misjudgment. Possibly an expensive after-thought, once the team figured that Delhi was not going to be a cake walk. Inviting Bedi to occupy a VIP seat at the Republic Day parade was an even bigger faux pas. The packaging and positioning of Kiran should have been left to those shadowy chaps in the BJP who control imaging, and do a pretty neat job of it. Either Modi had become so cocksure of his own abilities to pull off this coup that he himself side lined his A-Team, or his arrogance got the better of him. Combine Narendra Modi's inflated vanity with Kiran Bedi's monumental ego and what do you get? A crass monogrammed suit for the Prime Minster, and a Pink Panther outfit for his hand- picked Chief Ministerial candidate. Sartorial suicides!
	Would Shazia have done the trick? No chance! Her track record and hasty induction into a party she had publicly trashed on multiple occasions would have ensured an even more humiliating defeat for her and the party. In fact, so short-sighted has been Shazia's opportunistic move that she too may have to lick her wounds and get back to her old day job at a television channel. Both ladies have self-destructed spectacularly, and there is no way they'll be able to recover lost terrain in a hurry.
	Kiran Bedi is nobody's fool. She has demonstrated that in the past. But neither is the voter! She jumped into the fray for the wrong reasons, at the wrong time, and was ill-prepared, out of her depth and rather silly when it came to dealing with real issues. Ducking out of a public debate with Arvind Kejriwal made her appear evasive and darpok. Had she brazened it out, perhaps she would not have faced such a crushing defeat. And had her new political mentor Narendra Modi not announced her name as the BJP's Chief Ministerial candidate at the last minute, thereby ticking off a bunch of more deserving party loyalists, perhaps he himself would not have looked this dheela.
	The blame for the party's abject humiliation in the Capital of India rests squarely with the BJP high command and the leader. You know the old saying: You can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all the people, all the time! Win some, lose some, boys. That's how the political cookie crumbles. Take it on the chin... and move on. But first - ditch that wretched monogrammed suit.
	As for Ms Bedi. Worry not. From a Rose Pink Pathan Suit to a Rosy Blue one, it's only a matter of colour co-ordinating one's wardrobe according to one's convenience. Kiran's pretty good at being a quick change artist - she'll survive!
	Delhi's Pink Panther is feeling blue! BOO HOO....Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Hahaha. Lovely writing.<br/>
I agree with Monogrammed suit thing. <br/>
It shows the flamboyant and superfluous attitude of Modi. Although I am a big fan of him, I dislike his designer dress syndrome. Be simple, Mr. Modi. Humility wins hearts. Arrogance should show in foreign policies. Never at home politics.

                            Kiran needs to realise that for the aam admi, an election is not akin to a tennis match. It is their ticket to the amenities that they rightfully expect as citizens (and which they struggle to get). Once Kiran understands that simple truth, she may have a future in 21st century politics!

                            You did plastic surgery of your fossil face that doesn't meant other ladies should do it to. You made your career by sleeping with people but Kiran Bedi made it by becoming the first lady IPS officer and indulging in jail reform. Please don't mock her credentials.  <br/><br/>
Kiran Bedi recently joined politics and you expect from her to win a election on her own. Let me elaborate it by giving some example. Currently Indian opener Shikar Dhawan is not playing well so some of you will say its a good idea to find someone from India to replace him. But do you think right at time of WC getting some new opener from India who is not familiar with Australian condition gonna work. Remember during England test series when Zahir Khan got injured then RP Singh was called and we all know how that went.

I feel even BJP loyalists voted against her to show their protest against Shah and Saheb's  singel handedly managing the BJP. Modi's arrogance and vanity is suicidal, someone is saying it is the sraap of Advani and other senior veterans.

                            I wonder how this article would have panned out if BJP got the majority??? its so easy to whip up articles after election results, why not have the same guts to write this before the elections? <br/><br/>
May be this election is a wake up call to BJP, I want BJP to win a majority in Rajya Sabha so that important reforms can be brought in. <br/><br/>
Right now BJP should govern for the next 10 years to bring stability in India and then AAP will be mature and experienced enough to run the nation. <br/><br/>
AAP should mature at a nice rate not as a spike, till then it should become a good opposition in lok sabha.<br/><br/>
but, never let congress rule ever

                            Rib tickling but candid and absolutely true...delivered bang on the target! The lady had to loose for sure with her inflated arrogance, elephantine ego which made one feel as if she was still "serving" the country not as a police officer but more as a dictator. One is forced to think if she had shunned humility immediately after entering the services. And garlanding the PM...BJP has the world's most beautiful face!! Damn it...you needn't say more Ms. Bedi. And what is even more appalling is how could BJP being a seasoned political party having run governments both in the states and now in the centre too, can commit such a mother of blunders...How can you pick Kiran Bedi of all the faces if even 'honesty' and clean track record' was anything to go by... Bravo Shobha ji...thoroughly enjoyed your coloumn! Just rang up my father to make sure he reads it now...

The biggest comedy show on earth. Another one very nicely put: "Voters looked for the nearest bush behind which to puke when Bedi said 'Modi is the most beautiful face in the world." Tee hee.

                            What are you writing ? From all her achievements you decided not to vote her because of her pink suit? Thats a huge sign of intelligence:) Keep writing such articles. Its nice to see how small is your thinking. As a nation we should be judging politicians by their work not with their clothes or clothes shouldn't be a key deciding factor. This me..I know not everyone would agree with me. Kiran would hear her share of crappy comments as thats common when you loose..no one would praise a looser. I wish Arvind Kejriwal all the best, do you best and change Delhi for good:)

                            Perhaps this is not a right judgement that both the ladies  Kiran Bedi and Shazia Ilmi have spectacularly self destructed themselves and that there is no way they can recover their lost terrain.History of Indian politics stands witness to the<br/>
reality that politicians have fallen and have again risen from ground zero.A terrain is never lost for good..,may be for a <br/>
