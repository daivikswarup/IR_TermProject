Headline::::Mohan Bhagwat, Heal Thyself

	(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)
	Mohan Bhagwat should practice what he preaches. Before making uncharitable charges against Mother Teresa for conversion-based-service,  he should, as head of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh or RSS, examine the framework his own organization works in, and consider whether or not a fundamental course correction is in order if indeed its claim to social service is to be credible.
	The RSS is selective in the areas of its so-called social service. It does no social service work where minority communities live. The schools it runs are wholly devoted to promoting cultures related to Hindutva. Its organization, the Vanvasi Kalyan Parishad, working supposedly for "the uplift of tribal communities", seeks to subordinate tribal cultures within the Hindutva fold by imposing the worship of Hindu gods and goddesses. It targets poverty-stricken Christian tribals for enforced conversion or Ghar wapasi, and in its absence creates divisions and hostility within the community based on religion.
	 
	Even the term it uses - "Vanvasi", that is forest people - is in opposition to the term adivasi, which recognizes adivasis as indigenous people of the land. Its welfare projects among Dalit communities is marked by caste arrogance exemplified by an earlier statement made by Narendra Modi, trained as an RSS pracharak, when he glorified the degrading job of manual scavengers as being a spiritual service. Its defence of the caste system has now reached the absurd level of blaming " Mughal rule" for its creation. You will rarely if ever find RSS volunteers working in dalit bastis  where they have been victims of caste-based violence. In case after case where dalit houses have been burned, and hundreds of dalits rendered homeless, it is not the khaki shorts-clad volunteers who are seen, but progressive organizations working alongside dalit organizations and expressing solidarity through various means.
	 
	As illustrated in numerous official reports, the RSS has been held responsible for a large number of the communal conflagrations that have taken place in India since independence. It first creates the violence, and then selectively works among one section of the victims. It made its name during the bloody aftermath of the partition, working in Hindu refugee camps. It continues that strategy.  But not just in relation to Muslims. Citizens of Delhi who had mobilized in large numbers against the horrendous anti-Sikh violence in 1984 created networks which worked round the clock to offer solidarity and solace to the thousands who had become victims. The RSS was conspicuous by its absence.
	 
	Therefore when the Sangh attacks Mother Teresa, let them first turn the mirror on themselves. Their record shows one of communally -based discrimination in  their very choice of who the beneficiaries of their service should be. This is not social service but work to further a sectarian political agenda.
	 
	Mother Teresa started her work in Kolkata and in 1952 she set up the Nirmal Hridaya Home which took in destitutes, the abandoned, the sick and  the dying  off the streets of Kolkata. They were cleaned, fed and cared for. Many died within a few days of being rescued, but she and her band of dedicated volunteers made sure there was dignity in death. She ran a children's home for  those discarded by their parents because of a disability, left bundled on some street corner.  Many of the children were then adopted. The couples who adopted them were not chosen for their religion. There was therefore no question of conversion of the children since the adopted parents could belong to any religion. She also set up a home for those afflicted by leprosy and trained them to be self-sufficient.
	 
	Her biographer Navin Chawla writes of her response to his question of whether she did convert people to her religion. He writes "Without a moment's hesitation, she said, 'I do convert.  I convert you to be a better Hindu, a better Muslim, a better Protestant, a better Sikh.  Once you have found God, it is up to you to do with Him as you wish.'  She believed that conversion was God's work, not hers."
	 
	There has been varied criticism of Mother Teresa and her work. Some of it is valid including the sources of her funding, her acceptance of support from dodgy international political figures, including those accused of high-level corruption, her opposition to women's rights on the issue of abortion and so on. Charity-based work, as was Mother Teresa's, is often patronizing and a salve for the conscience of the rich. She never questioned the reasons for poverty, and so some said that she glorified poverty and the sufferings of the poor unlike the liberation theologians of Latin America who worked to change their condition through social justice.  But as Jyoti Basu, the legendary communist leader who was Chief Minister of Bengal in 1997 when Mother Teresa  passed away, said "There was one thing in common between us, we both love the poor." He paid homage to her work and her service to those who he said fell between the cracks of a sometimes uncaring city.
	 
	She loved the poor, that is something beyond the RSS to understand, since it only knows how to convert love into hate.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mother Teresa was a great soul but one who always took the side of the Church (even against science). She followed her faith and used her work to forward her faith. There's nothing wrong with that. India was invaded and the invaders killed people to make them follow their faith. Not acceptable but what can be done about it now. Indonesia, for example, is a Hindu converted Muslim nation that lives peacefully. But if a Hindu says anything for his religion, in India, it becomes criminal in this country. Why is it so ? Can you answer this Ms. Psuedo Secular Brinda Karat. Why a Hindu can't promote his faith. Are you afraid of losing your identity ?

                            The question is whether Mother Teresa converted or not. The answer is YES, because that's what the missionaries do. Why would you write about what RSS does/should do. Obviously, the communist doesn't like the RSS.

Brinda Karat conveniently ignores how Christian tribals came into existence as the bitter truth that christian missionaries mass converted the tribals luring them with money or threatening them of eternal damnation.

                            I think we Indian are the only people who have no respect for our religion and tradition and it could be possibily because of the fact that we were invaded and ruled by foreigners by more than 500 years.In this country, Hindu bashing is considered fashinable and secular. Is it not a irony that no voices are raised or even debated when hindus are converted but if the same people are reconverted to Hindusim, it becames a controversy. I fail to understand whey we have such double standards. Similarly, no body even Mohan Baghwat is questioning the quality of work that Mother Teresa has done but what he is questioning and many of us do, is converting people necessary to serve them. Being hindus we don't believe in showcasing our achievements and work but in todays world what matters most is marketing and being in the news. Like Mother Teresa, there are many organizations like Ramakrishna Mission which have done a lot of work for the upliftment of people in terms of free education, medical facilities for poor and margalized sections of the society in West Bengal. In fact they have done much more than probably Mother Teresa without the financial backing that she had. But, most people are not even aware of it because Ramakrishna Mission following a Hindu philosophy don't brag about it or so to put market it.

                            All the comments reflect excellent logic - one way or the other. Now, lets get to the point : there are still the destitute, the abandoned, the sick and the leper to be taken care of. Who is willing to take over the work of the Missionaries of Charity and at what price ? RSS, IUML, ISIL, Bharat Sevashram...<br/><br/>
I am an atheist - never quite understood how god(s) could be intolerant. But what foxes me is that each of you  will gladly take a blood transfusion ( when needed ) irrespective of the donor's religion in order to live, but will probably die to defend your faith against the same individual.  <br/><br/>

                            Christians in West Bengal comprises of just 0.6 % of the total state population. So where did all the converted Christians go? India will continue to be a backward country because of such elements who spread hatred between religion and community and try to capitalize on them.

That Mother Teresa has done marvelous things with the needy is widely known , accepted, and respected. No arguments on that. However, behind all such missionary activities by a religious foundation has an underlying unstated agenda of spreading the particular religion,- this is also an widely known and accepted fact, there need not be any argument on that too.<br/><br/>
What comes out as the icing on the cake in this article is her comparison of Mother with Jyoti Basu!!! Jyoti Basu and 'love for the poor'? Wow !!!!

                            Brindaji, please go to the ground level and see what work RSS us doing for tribals before making such baseless allegations. Vanvasi Kalyan programme DOES NOT discriminate on the basis of caste or religion. In fact it is aimed to provide education to the children of tribals in far flung pockets. Also what has your party done to improve the plight of destitutes in Kerala. Your party openly supports fundamental Christian organisations there and pits them against Hindus! So please stop preaching Madam. RSS doesn't need lessons in social inclusion from Communists!

So called intellectuals of India keep on demeaning Hindu culture. If you demean Hindu religion i am still okay but you guys are disrespectful to India way of life. I admire her but we should respect facts. Facts are facts only in our country we have given respect to Invaders with Akbar Road, Aurangjeb Road, Shahjahan road in the heart of Lutyen Delhi

                            What is wrong with Conversion? Why Hindutva people so scared of it? If anyone is forcibly converted to some faith, it is wrong. But if someone wins over the other through logic, love and service, what is wrong with it? Who can take away people's right to accept or not accept a religion? Why should I be faithful to any religion that practices casteism, defends patriarchy and promotes superstition? The only way Hindutavadis can hold their dalits and tribals to their religion is by practicing equality, by denouncing caste system, by encouraging inter-caste marriages,by working in Dalit colonies and by empowering the tribals? We may be "sikulars", but know that you are bloody communal.

                            The conversations here assume that conversion is wrong even if one wants to convert and is not forced to do so. This is going against the fundamental right of a human being. The right to religious freedom is inherent in human beings. Sister Nirmala is a Brahmin and she says "I cherish within me the most beautiful values of Hinduism. I come from that religion, from that culture. My roots are there and I cannot, I must not, forget them. I believe that there is partial truth in the other religions, and therefore also in Hinduism. But only Christ is the truth".

                            If religious cause motivates someone to serve humanity then I find no issues with it. Mr. Bhagwat can also try to convert people but before that should first clean the lepers, feed the orphans and give the society down-casts the dignity to living. If he can't do that then he can't prevent others from doing. Religion is a private matter. If a person sees genuine love and seeks to adopt the religion of those who showed him love, its his choice. If people of all religions have a similar motivation to show kindness this world can only be a better place.

                            Mrs.Brinda Karat is unknowingly proving exactly what Mohanji Bhagawat told. He told' Afcourse Mother Theresa did services but when a motive of conversion lies beneath , it is devalued. Mrs. Brinda glorifies works of Mother in few paragraphs after which no one contradicts. Then quoting Navin Chawla she tells she agreed conversion happens but believed its god's will. Infact all so called conservationists believe the same.Please let us know what is wrong then in Mohanji's words.<br/>
Now Regarding RSS's works she may not have idea more than what she read from Left Magazines.Again She self contradicts, at first she says RSS doesn't works among minorities and in same breath says It's bringing Gharwapsi among 'poor Christian tribals'. And can she take the pain to explain how Christian Belief endorsed the tribal Gods etc.And while quoting Narendra modi to prove an Anti Dalit stance she forgets Mr. Modi himself is from an OBC background and the simple fact that no body identifies him on cast background unless many other Indian cast card politicians underlines the value of RSS.<br/>
Being Blind by your ideology is acceptable as long as you are  not trying take on the leaders working among people. Come to ground and learn what happens here or maybe your generation of leaders will be one who will be renowned later as Gorbachevs of Indian communist party.

                            Adivasis  are Hindus because they worship nature which is very Hindu,and Hindu is not a religion its a way of life and its same whether a adivasi worshiping Ganga or forest or land or nature  like any Hindu anywhere in India and its not christian way of life as surprisingly a communist wants us to believe.

                            Just amazed to see how media in 80% hindu country is strongly against logic and can malign hindu saints without proof and bow before mullah and missionaries like John Dayal. Bhagwat is absolutely right in the statement he made .she did good work and she converted people too.

                            "Mother Teresa's only motive was to serve the poor. Through all my years with her, I have not experienced or seen any kind of conversion. I am a Sikh," said Sunita Kumar, a spokesperson of the organization, who started working with Mother Teresa in 1965.

                            Mohan Bhagwat has said nothing new and nothing wrong.The sad part is we Indians do not have the interest to study books or acquire some information before venting out our anger here.I don't think even 5% of the people commenting here (both for and against) have read the book written by Navin Chawla, a staunch Congress supporter,on Mother Teresa. In that book she has herself admitted that her purpose is to bring people from all walks of life "into the fold of Christianity".Nobody denies that she did a lot of good work,not even Mohan Bhagwat.But she did all that along with converting not only Hindu Dalits but Muslims too.Nobody in this country ever dares to speak the truth. At least Mohan Bhagwat does that.Regarding the media, Nobody ever complains when the majority is converted to minority.But there is a huge uproar whenever some so called 'minority' is converted to the majority.As for Brinda Karat, she belongs to a party which wanted Communist rule in India like China.Being pro-poor does not mean keeping the poor as 'poor' so that these so called secular parties get their share of votes of the 'poor'

                            Mother Teresa was very clear, she was a missionary with a zeal for proselytizing. The ideal platform was to look after the lepers and the orphans as also the poorest of the poor - the simple folks to baptize and convert. She has herself claimed it to be so, and so has her beatification scroll read by the POPE. So maybe our pseudo-intellectuals need to think carefully. Is it right if social service is done with a motive??? Why similar fervor not shown when the Christian fundamentalists slander our own Saints of yesteryears? Double standards??? Sad, but this is the gift of the Britishers, who changed the education system so that the educated deride our own religion and culture. All religions have warts and weals, but you do not hear them accept such derision!!!

                            It would be a great idea for Ms Brinda Karat to set her own house in order first. Why did the honest and most experienced 91 year old Comrade Mr. V S Achudananthan leave the Communist meeting mid-way at Allepey, Kerala?You all did the same to Mr. Somnath Chatterjee and lost Bengal forever. Are you planning to royally exit from your last citadel, Kerala also? Best of Luck for scripting the obituary of Communism in state after state because of the incompetent and lazy Politburo members.

                            Ms. Brinda Karat, hope you work towards strengthening your party rather than on such incidents. It is common knowledge all over India that Mother Teresa was a deeply religious person proven by the fact that she became a nun and devoted herself to her lord. She was a great human sent on this earth to help those in need. But it is also a given fact that she also took forward her faith and conversions did take place. This does not take away from her service to humanity. There is no harm in accepting it because if she is an example of the goodness of Christianity then there must be scores of people wanting to follow her faith. Why is everyone so defensive on this issue ? During ancient times India was a Hindu country. Christianity and Islam was brought by outsiders. People were converted willingly or forcibly to these faiths. How else would there be so many christians and muslims in India ? So if Christianity and Islam can undertake conversions then why do Ms. Karat and her ilk take offence when Hindus take to converting people to hinduism as we know it. The argument as to which caste would they belong to can be answered by answers to the questions that to which sect do neo christians or neo muslims belong when they convert? are they Roman catholics or protestants or syrian christians or Jehovah's witnesses or born again christians or orthodox christians or Marthomites etc or are they sunnis or shias or wahabis or ahamediyas or bohris or khojas etc ?

                            "Gupt daan" is concept inherent to Hinduism where charity is done without any expectations. Most of the charity in world by other religious organization is done to convert people , this is fact. Having said this if poor people are helped its a good thing, no one is stopping any other organisations to do the same.

                            The main aim of christian missionaries is to spread christianity ok accepted. So what are hindu temples doing in US, UK and all non hindu countries where thousands of foreigners are converting to hinduism. So if hindus do it, its human rights and if christians of muslims do it they have a agenda.. Wow hindu mentality.. stop your lies.. every religion has a right to preach itself and every person has a right to convert to the religion that suits him or her

                            If RSS do what Mother Theresa did, the conversions would voluntarily happen. The converted probably did not see Jesus and took a decision, they saw what Mother Theresa did in the name of her God and believed it was God's work.<br/>
If RSS truly believe their God's message, let them serve the believers and the non believers like Mother Theresa, then Ghar Wapsi will happen naturally.

But then Mrs Karat also need to look into her own organisation and have the courage to admit that the CPM has long lost its cause of promotion of welfare of the poor.The day they genuinely care for the poor and not just raise slogans i will respect her views.The day she has courage to stand against personal enrichment of leaders within CPM i will respect her.
