Headline::::How Dengue Was Allowed to Overpower Delhi



DateTime::::2015-09-17T16:10:00+05:30




                                Last week in the capital, a couple committed suicide unable to bear the grief of the death of their seven-year-old son Avinash of complications related to Dengue. A few days later, a second child, Aman also succumbed to dengue. In both these cases, the parents with their very sick child had rushed from hospital to hospital, most of them private hospitals, that denied them admission. The details differ, the criminal callousness does not. When hospitals start acting like cinema theatres with houseful signs up, you know something is seriously wrong with the system.
It took these two tragic deaths and the resultant public outrage for the Delhi Government to act. It issued show cause notices to the hospitals, it warned all hospitals against refusing admissions, it set Iimits to what private labs are charging for dengue blood tests and so on. But it was too little too late.
The official figures of dengue afflicted persons at 1800 plus are underestimates as everyone knows - as are the number of the people who have lost their lives. The official count is 15, but the Director of St. Stephen's Hospital is on record that in his hospital alone, at least seven dengue deaths have taken place.
The question is, if the Government had acted in time, could the current dengue epidemic have been at least controlled, if not avoided? It is true that the AAP Government has been in office for just six months, certainly too short a time to deal with the multiple problems inherited from its predecessor regimes run by the Congress and the BJP, including the multiplicity of authorities. But unless it takes a more comprehensive view of the structural reasons behind the current public health crisis and acts accordingly, the worst is yet to come.
The first warnings came much earlier in the year around March when the officials of the National Vector Born Disease Control Programme had alerted the newly-elected Delhi Government of the possibilities of a bad Dengue outbreak based on their readings of the weather forecasts of the Meteorological department. These warnings were not taken seriously.
The key to dealing with dengue is in the preventive steps to be taken to eliminate as far as possible the source where the Aedes mosquito breeds: standing fresh water. The preparations should have started straight away and the systems been in place by June. In the context of the increase in population, unplanned city growth and extremely poor and deteriorating civic facilities in the capital, the task is obviously herculean. It requires the strengthening of public health services and the political will and prioritization to build a large social mobilization with the inclusion of RWAs, bhagidari samitis (which bring together government officers with citizens) and ordinary folk in a joint effort to clear all such sources. Sadly, this is not what happened.
The blame game between the Centre, the State and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) even on the most minor of issues hijacked the agenda for health.
Today when the Delhi Health Minister orders "MCD workers to go house to house to ensure all stagnant water is treated", it sounds like a joke, adding insult to the tragedy of illness and consequent loss of livelihood, affecting lakhs of Delhi's citizens. Please also inform Delhi-ites, Mr. Health Minister, who are these "MCD workers" you are referring to? Are you not aware that the MCD services, once so robust, have been outsourced, privatized and the workforce contractualised? Who do you think is going to do the checks, Mr. Health Minister?
One of the crucial services provided by the MCD was of a set of trained personnel known as domestic breeding checkers (DBCs) who check breeding spots in house-to-house visits and use the appropriate larvae-killing insecticides. Today, the programme is in shambles. In spite of warnings, there has been no effort to enhance the number of DBCs (domestic breeding checkers). For example, in South Delhi, one of the badly affected regions, whereas requirement of such checkers is 2700, the sanctioned posts are only 1300, of which 1195 are in place. It is the same story in other corporations. According to senior officials, not only are the numbers of DBCs grossly inadequate, the main checking, in the absence of more rigorous training, is limited to checking water in coolers.
The other levels of service to ensure prevention are provided by Malaria Inspectors and Assistants Inspectors. Here again the shortfall is staggering. Out of a sanctioned strength of 1155 Malaria and Assistant Malaria Inspectors, only 416 are in place, around one third. At the same time, there has been little or no effort towards any kind of social mobilisations to beat the Dengue menace. Sending messages on mobile phones to people not to panic is not going to be half as effective as just organizing a huge effort to clean up the most notorious breeding places.
Officials in the know speak about the power of offenders, like the builder lobby, or those businesses situated in industrial areas. Construction sites are notorious for breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Officials say that although Bombay has bylaws that give the corporation the right to cancel licenses for building unless they fulfil conditions of the treatment of stagnant water, a given at any construction site, the builders lobby in Delhi has succeeded in sabotaging any such move as have those running businesses in industrial areas. Workers in these sectors are the most affected.
In spite of the AAP's declared commitment to improving health services in the city, the focus seems to be on hospitals.The increased budgetary allocations are still, it would appear, at the realm of plans. On the ground, allocations to municipal corporations' health services have seen severe shortfalls. In North Delhi, while the allocated amount was 117 crores, according to the Mayor of North Delhi, only 29 crores rupees have been released. The allocation itself is much less than the 157 crores allocated last year.
A recent estimate has further broken up allocations specifically for countering vector-borne diseases. It shows that the allocations have been reduced from 9 per cent of the total health budget in Delhi in 2012-2013 to justÂ  4.8 per cent in 2015-2016. Moreover, what is puzzling is that in spite of the earlier experiences of dengue outbreaks in the capital, the Delhi Government itself slashed its assessment of the requirement of funds from the Centre from 260 crores in 2012-2013 to just 42 crores in 2015-2016. This shows that the Delhi Government itself was disinterested in taking the required steps to strengthen the public health system and therefore reduced its demand accordingly.
The role of the centre has been shockingly callous. It has been consistently denying the demands made by Delhi, whether it was the Congress UPA Government granting barely one third of the demand made by Delhi, or now the Modi Government, under whom the allocations have plummeted to an all-time low - from 50 crores in 2012-2013 to just 17 crores in 2015-2016. The Modi Government it would seem is still finding it difficult to digest its resounding defeat in the Delhi polls and is hellbent on making things difficult for the Delhi Government.
While the Delhi Government cannot escape its own responsibility for marginalizing such an important health service which could mean the difference between life and death, it is the central government driven by its narrow agendas which is mainly responsible.
Dengue is not new to Delhi, nor is a Dengue epidemic and deaths. But what is disturbing is that after every such outbreak, lessons are are quickly forgotten and recommendations made by experts buried deep. The reasons are structural going beyond the insensitivity of this or that leader or government. In the last few decades, an ideological framework has been developed which is geared towards replacing public health services with insurance-based health schemes. Everything is geared towards hospital-based insurance which benefits the private sector by transferring public funds for private profit while the patient's needs often get forgotten. This model has not worked anywhere in the world. Yet, we are seeing governments in India led by the central government pushing insurance as the panacea for health system problems. The Delhi dengue epidemic has shown the folly of such a path.Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Corruption is the only cause of dengue spread. Crores of funds are not reaching to the people to keep the place clean and hygene. Money is guzzled by corrupt municipality officials. And it will never end unless and untill Delhi is made a independent state. Fight between central govt controlled MCD and govt controlled health dept will spoil the up keep and governance.

                            The current dengue crisis in Delhi is the result of incompetence of the AAP government. However, long term health care should be nationalized and we should have something like  the NHS of UK where health care is provided free of cost irrespective of cost of treatment. Right now in India those who  can afford medical facilities get excellent healthcare but a vast majority are deprived of medical facilities  and this creates a divide in society which is unhealthy.

                            very informative article. Lot of steps need to taken to prevent an epidemic and its a systemic failure which needs to be tackled. In an era where talk is going on about smart cities the govts and local bodies are unable to contain vector brone disease like dengue malaria. Politicizing the issue is not going to help the cause, hope the current manance subside, other cities too act proactively and all lessons are learnt. Maybe its asking for too much from current establishment, where health is the least priority and the entire discourse is on increasing GDP.

                            If politicians and media spoke more about issues like health, safety and cleanliness, may be things would have been better. Rather 80% of the time talk is about divisive issues related to secularism and vote bank politics.

I think kerala affected the worst with dengue during past few years even with its abundant rate of doctors of 1doctor for 700 patients lots of death happened.. It is not only govt but also people's fault too in the spread of the disease.

                            "predecessor regimes run by the Congress and the BJP" ..well BJP last governed the state in 1998. Been 17 years since. I like Kejriwal's recent steps on tackling Dengu, but alas, they are little too late. Kejriwal likes to take up issues like Robinhood only once there is public concern and media highlight so that he HOGS the LIMELIGHT. Sad state of the capital. Today Delhi has the best infrastructure in the country due to Sheila's regime.

                            Poor people were agitating so hard to kill socialism and now they are crying for help is basically wrong. In capitalism there is no legal provision for help other than charity and to get it one has to beg. The brighter side of all this papaya exercise is that we are managing our population to enjoy development and one can asses it from physical or economical increase in VIP weight.

                            Hey jumla polticians why do not you go out and clean. Is Delhi not your city , or is it in Pakistan. <br/><br/>
These political franchise are here for drama, they are here for drama on people's death, they are here for people.<br/><br/>
I understand the ultimate goal of bhakts and political franchise is to show Delhities, khujliwal is failure. These franchise would like to tell the people of delhi, " you did not vote us, so you saw the dengu". Its a shame we build our browny points over death of citizens. Not one political franchise dared to get together and develop hospitals or clean delhi.<br/><br/>
Modi is no different, he is all jumla.<br/><br/>
Say for example: if your neighbours house was on fire, would you not put it off even with your difference or would you go an have fun.<br/><br/>
If you - modi or papu or any politicians - have an ability to dissect the situation, you will see who is fool. With your foolish acts or selfish gains you will see the destruction of kutumbham, destruction of social fabric.<br/><br/>
Modi /papu have behaved as crabs; bring the other down by hook or crook. MODI IS GROWNUP BUT HE BEHAVES AS 2 YRS OLD KID.<br/><br/><br/>
Having written about the political class, I would say the people/citizens/voters are equally responsible.<br/><br/>
Why cannot each one clean the surrounding and get rid of Dengu ? This would have stopped the vector from propagating.<br/><br/><br/>
Added to each ones responsibility , the climate has played a major role, a warm weather after the rainy season results in propagation of vector.<br/><br/>
Health care:<br/>
On the healthcare system, no political franchise talks about it, as they have kept us busy with religion/cast/region differences.<br/>
The health care needs trillions of dollars in public health care system (Education of doctors to nurses, establishment of hospitals, modern technology related to pattern recognition and robotics and automated analysis of samples).

                            Very good. Now what? The CPM does not exist in Delhi. The AAP has proved its incompetence in every arena of governance. It is very easy to be wise in hindsight. And list out all the things that could have been done and were not. Instead of these stupid polemics it is better to shut up. The CPM in West Bengal had provided very poor health services while in power. Which is continued by TMC. Every year you hear of at least 200 children dying in Bengal's hospitals. So why cry over dengue in Delhi? The people have to suffer with incompetent administrators in every state in India. Bar none.

                            A well written and informative article. Wish every politician took issues like this seriously and took action. In the case of Dengue, preventive measures are more important.

                            If BJP win in Bihar they will build a case for President Rule in Delhi.

                            Dengue is a public health problem and what I mean by this is that it is a man made problem due to pollution, unhygienic and insanitary conditions. There has to be a massive shift in attitudes of all citizens to address this issue just specifically blaming the government is premature and unwarranted. The apathy by the government is something that you expect in India - nothing new about it, they are pathetic and hopeless. I just get this feeling that a human life does not matter as much in India and that is truly shocking. The public need to do more not just the government, private hospitals should be sued for crores in this situation which has led to the loss of lives of innocent children who had a future ahead of them. Come on Indians we have to face this head on and change our environment and keep it clean and safe for the new generation.We should have the basic freedoms in life and that includes a healthy life for all our children. The blame game should start with us!
