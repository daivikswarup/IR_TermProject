Headline::::Fed Up of Akhara of Parliament? TV is to Blame



DateTime::::2015-08-17T17:16:00+05:30




                                There has been much breast-beating in the media and among the chatterati in general over the complete "washout" of Parliament's Monsoon session. The Chairman of the Rajya Sabha flagged his disgust at 91 percent of the proceedings having been disrupted in a most telling gesture. He decided not to read out a report on the proceedings of the House before adjourning it sine die, as he and his predecessors have been traditionally doing, but cryptically announced that the Secretary-General would be circulating the report and then asked Members to stand for the National Song. An instrumental version of Vande Mataram is played at the end of each session. This time, several Members decided to un-harmoniously sing along. That seemed appropriate given how un-harmonious the session itself had been. We then repaired respectively to Mahatma Gandhi's statue (Congress) and Vijay Chowk (BJP) to demonstratively continue the politics of slogan-mongering. This has been assailed by the likes of Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a formidable intellectual non-politician, as "great historical hope stymied by little men".
Personally, I would much rather return to the decorum of yesteryear. But it seems such aimlessly wishful thinking to do so. That was an era of Inner Temple barristers and Oxbridge graduates who had learned political propriety from their Edwardian peers and were determined to show their erstwhile colonial masters that they were quite as adept as the Brits at Westminster's ways - and, therefore, deserved to be free. Members would come armed with Erskine May and even Communists like Hiren Mukherjee and Bhupesh Gupta would show off their rich research into British Parliamentary practice by citing David Lindsay Keir and Sir Ivor Jennings. Precedents from the House of Commons' Mr. Speaker's rulings would be invoked to score points of order and the proceedings were all very prim and propah. The Yamuna was deemed to flow as smoothly as the Thames. 
This was already beginning to change a quarter century ago when I was first elected to the Lok Sabha in 1991. We had disruption but even George Fernandes could be brought to order in a couple of days. Question Hour and Zero Hour gave backbenchers an opportunity for participation. And because debates were not squeezed between bouts of shouting, there was time enough for everyone interested to have their say.
Then came several changes with the best of intentions. Television was brought into the premises. Later, TV crews were allowed, indeed encouraged, to flood the courtyard outside Parliament. It was assumed that being on camera would bring out the best in parliamentary behavior. In fact, it brought out the worst. For the cameras in the House encouraged demonstration in preference to debate. And the ready availability of TV at the doorstep meant the chief disrupters could close down the House, then rush out to the cameras and have their full say with millions watching and no one interrupting or rebutting. Parliamentary reporting from the Press gallery turned into the dullest item in the following day's papers. Where the Inder Malhotras and Prem Bhatias of half a century ago had made their names by reporting from the gallery, now the only time the gallery is full is when there is chaos in the House. The minute a normal, civilized debate begins, the Press galleries empty even faster than the backbenches.
And the masses love it. There can be few proceedings more boring than the legislative process. Apart from those who are speaking and those waiting to speak, Members retire almost en masse to Central Hall for coffee and gossip. The Press, for its part, quits the gallery to quietly swallow subsidized samosas and look elsewhere for scandal. To the extent reporters watch the proceedings at all, it is from the TV sets installed in the pressroom outside. I got more front-page coverage on being accused (falsely) by Sadhvi Uma Bharti for an "obscene gesture" than from all the reams of learned oratory that has poured out of my lungs in the last quarter century. "Bytes" and "breaking news" have destroyed more Parliamentary propriety than the Members themselves.
I repeat: the masses love it. No Member has been rejected by the electorate because he is a habitual disrupter. Indeed, I discovered I was something of a hero in Mayiladuturai because the Tamil papers had (wrongly) reported that I had moved in to punch in the nose a Member who had called me a "Pakistani agent". I had merely turned viciously on him to demand he apologize, but my constituents embellished the story of my physically menacing him to the point where I thought I might even win the next election! That is why I congratulate Rashtrapati Bhavan's Hindi translator who has rendered the President's Independence-eve description of Parliament as an "arena of combat" into "akhara", a wrestling-pit. Our people actually want to see Parliament as an akhara and reward the disruptionists with re-election. And our backbenchers, deprived of the opportunity of participating in meaningful debate because so little time is allotted for discussion, find themselves participating most meaningfully in the proceedings when they are in the Well of the House. 
I think the Pratap Bhanu Mehtas need to recognize these ground sociological realities. Till the nineteenth century, boxing in England was an unregulated sport, a free for all, in which any limb could be used and any part of the anatomy could be targeted. Along came the Marquess of Queensbury and codified the rules of boxing. We thought the Queensbury Rules for Parliamentary practice could be easily transposed from London to Delhi. We are being proved wrong. There has to be an authentically vernacular idiom in which the Indian Parliament needs to be conducted. It may borrow something from foreign practice but until the Rules for the Akhara of Parliament are formulated, chaos will continue to rule.
That is not a pretty prospect, but it is only if the Rules of Business are recast to take into account the vernacularization of Indian Parliamentary practice that a semblance of order will descend on the House. We have to throw away the present book and hold a fresh convention of parliamentary leaders to rewrite the text so that when a "point of order" is raised, it does not become a prelude to disorder.(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Sorry MSA. Congress is to blame. Congress failed the country in the monsoon session when it obstructed the parliament on a flimsy excuse. Congress failed itself when it could not find a legitimate cause to oppose the government. Congress was let down by its leadership led by Sonia Ji and Rahul Ji.

                            Only Congress members can be this shameless. So much of chaos and flouting all the rules( Division of A.P for one example),disrespecting constitution and still pat your self for all the uncouth thins you do in the name of parliament and governance. I am disgusted of our M.Ps, Congress in particular. As they Don't have an iota of worry about the poorest of poor on the road. Me, Myself...Instead of being apologetic about wasting country's money and precious time to make life better for people, you are gloating and feeling elated???<br/>
I am sorry we have voters who do not know what they are doing.<br/>
When Congress came to power   after 10 yrs, congress MLAs in AP were openly being corrupt and justified on the camera that it is their right to make money as they were given power after a long gap.

                            Mani, in the article you praise yourself at good debater (and/or orator). You are great man. Let me tell you this article is not something which can be loved (and, by the way, we do not like watching modern news channels where shows can be best described as controversy series but they are all over so one keeps visiting one channel or other). But you, instead of accepting fault and trying to improve, are justifying the stupidity and selfishness of MPs (Rahul, in particular). By reading a lot and referring to various articles you might be part of intellectuals, but certainly are not worth of sense.

                            There are more oft times that i dont agree with Mr Mani but this time i completely agree with him. Yes, the Parliament is turning into  a 'Press pit', not a pulpit.<br/>
But what i might not fully agree with you Mr Mani, is that the audience lap this up. No, i dont think we do. We feel terribly sorry that 'learned' men and women behave like spoilt brats. The rest of us need to go with the old proverb - spare the rod and spoil the kid -. Well i think thats what the public would just love to do !!!

                            Dear Sir, I am a common man, could not understand the content, the logic behind the above write up, but parliament has been demonized, your batch of unworthy people are occupying the highest positions in the country, both the opposition and ruling party have no difference at all, except sitting in 2 sides of the house,they have no concern towards this country, when compared to the looting done in your tenure , the present corruption charges are insignificant, but your party is creating this kind uproar just to stay<br/>
in limelight , these crooks are also not better, but still, there has been a lot of hope from this<br/>
government, so the people wants to give them some more time, the congress should realise that feeling <br/>
of people, otherwise, your will become a single digit party in parliament next time.

Besides, isn't he the same guy who said the MSY perhaps is the product of his father meeting MSY's mother or something to that effect?

                            PARLIAMENT SHOWS THE WAY- LAWYERS FOLLOW<br/>
                                           -----------------------<br/><br/><br/>
Following the brilliant example set by our respected  Parliamentarians, the Bar Council of India  moved an emergent change in the  advocate conduct rules. It has now been resolved that since the representatives of the people always lead us, and since lawyers form a majority among them,  henceforth, advocates, in particular, in causes with public interest, shall represent the respective lawyers' associations, registered by the Bar Council of India, be entitled to go  to the Well of The Court, when the Court was in session. The advocate members were authorised to hold Placards which will be treated Grounds of Submissions in relation to the cause heard.<br/><br/>
Since it has been found that our Parliamentarians, who are shining examples of conduct for the citizenry have all at one time or other invaded the Well of the two Houses, and proved the efficacy of such invasion in ensuring that Justice was done to the people, the Bar Council has decided to emulate the stellar precedent as they in the legal fraternity are also involved in resolutions of disputes in public interest.<br/><br/>
Our Parliamentarians have demonstrated that their debating skills are honed and enhanced in the field of play when it is combined with ability to raid the Well of The  House and ensure that proceedings were not one sided and the Speakers yielded them<br/>
Equal opportunity to disrupt the House with robust interventions. Deliberations in Parliament on constitutionalIssues are illuminating when they are embellished with Placards and continuous slogan shouting which emphasise the grounds of challenge.<br/><br/>
Hence forth the learned Judges would follow the Speaker or Chairman of the House, as the case may be, and instead of lawyers pleading their clients' causes, the Presiding Officers shall plead with the advocates to let the Courts function, so that voice of the people prevailed through the conduct and vocal chords of the advocates rather than the dictatorial ways of the Presiding deities. Such co operative conduct by the Judges would ensure that Justice was for the people , by the people and of the people and there would be no unilateral judgments thrust down the throats of the litigants.<br/><br/>
Just as democracy bristles so colourfully in the peoples' Houses, the courts also would reflect the wishes and wisdom of the people of india. No cause or case would be lost as the groups of lawyers can always be organized for any and every cause, as they are readily available, at subsidised rates, to ensure that no case was dismissed contrary to the wishes of the said groups.<br/>
Our High Court was first to  go ahead with implementing this changed dispensation rule. Fire crackers were burst outside on the roads, huge banners and posters praising the BCI and the respective association leaders were  plastered around the  High Court complex. There were marches and processions taken by over 250 odd associations and the electronic media had a gala time telcasting  all of it in real time.<br/>
Just the court bell rung and first of the cases were called in each court, several groups of advocates' of rival associations ran into the wells of each court. There were far too many jostling for space and  there was hungama. Even as the Judges were trotting in for the start of the session, they got sucked into the crowds  and could not get to the dias. Some of them swooned and were trampled upon. The security in place was too minimal  and did not anticipate such a  huge reception for the changed rules.<br/>
Leaders of various associations got on to the dias  and played musical chair to occupy the Judge's chair and in the melee the chairs broke. Several lawyers tore the case bundles, some wrote favourable orders for their clients and  many ran away with them and addressed the media on how the changed rules had restored their faith in democracy and transparency  and vested power in the people.<br/>
The Full Court met to decide the issue arising out of the changed rule. As the Chief Justice got up to address,  some of the Judges got into the well of the meeting and sought similar changes for Judges also  and the Chief Justice immediately took to his heels.<br/>
In the meanwhile, the  Advocates practicing before the subordinate courts in TN announced that they would be boycotting courts until BCI amended their rules for subordinate courts also..<br/>
As for the High Court, the registrar lodged a complaint with CBI to trace the missing Chief Justice.

Mr. Iyer, is very right in saying that we - the masses of India really like this kind of hooliganism in the parliament and that is why we enjoy it when the media shows it. Sometime I feel that we, as humans, haven't been able to remove the "animal" within us and that is why we cannot see a "sane discussion and debate" in the House.

                            I guess TV was brought in for people to understand Parliamentary Proceedings and not disciplining MPs. Indian Public knows how well behaved their MPs are. As long as MPs do not consider their duties and behaviour is important, change is difficult. Parliamentarian Accountability Bill needs to be brought in with provisions of Expulsion and ban on fighting an election in any democratic system. Lets discipline our MPs specially Congress MPs.

                            Yes TV is the reason. As Sonia and Raga cannot debate with any eloquence , and the good debaters in Congress all lost their seats , they have to create disruptions to be noticed on TV.

                            There you go! For everything Aiyer loves to quote his great love for British customs and traditions. And believes that they are the best! What to do? He is only a mediocre brown South Indian babu! Aspiring to glory by hanging on to the coat tails of the Gandhis. Since Sonia ignores him, he can always be found in the shadow of the other stalwart of mediocrity, Rahul Baba! He forgot that parliamentary indecency, along with the Emergency and organised corruption, started with his idol Indira Gandhi. "Reams of learned oratory that has poured out of my lungs in the last quarter century" really took the cake. Aiyer is such a moron that he does not realise that the whole of Parliament was rolling in the aisles whenever he opened his stupid mouth! Anyway, he gets an E for entertainment, though he probably did not intend it to be so comical.

                            Mani the moron at his vitriolic best!  The difference this time is that he has not indulged in Modi baiting!  Cambridge educated Mani the moron thinks that the 'masses love it!'  Well, Mani, I am part of the masses and I hate every second of it! The various luminaries that Mani the moron has quoted as being the bastions of Parliamentary propriety are way, way in the past.  In any case, we do not have to follow the Westminster model.  We are an independent country and will follow our own system.  Whilst the 'gundagiri' of both sides, Government and Opposition in disrupting Parliament is abhorrent, there is no need for us to accept Mani the moron's standard which seems to be that you can say anything and the opponent it is aimed at or the opponent's supporters have no right to be offended.  Utter rubbish!  We have every right to be offended!  We have every right to be offended at Mani's edict that the Gandhi family, notwithstanding its  incompetence, lack of merit, pathological corruption and foreign origin has a right to rule India, that we cannot question that right and God help those who do question that right!  While we, the masses do recognise Mani the moron's right to be a rabid sycophant to that family, we do not recognise his right to say that the Gandhis can disrupt Parliament but we cannot!  Why else has he not uttered a word against Sonia Gandhi who actually led her cohorts into disrupting parliament?  Is it beyond Mani the moron's intellectual capacity to understand that an Italian waitress with 44 seats cannot decide who the PM of this country with 282 seats wants as his Foreign Minister and she cannot decide who the CMs of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are; only the people can!   As for Mani's 'untrue' threat to physically attack a fellow MP calling him a Pakistani agent, a pity Mani did not actually attempt to do so; he would have been flattened and we the humble masses would have been sparred his customary diatribes against Modi.

He is an ideologue to Soniaji and his illustrious son Rahul baba.<br/>
Incidentally, Dr.Amartya Sen (povertarian Economist)who unleashed all his contacts to lobby for the Nobel is also a great admirer of the intellectual family. <br/>
 Indian National Congress was started in December 1885, by Mr.A.O.Hume,a retired ICS official to keep  Indian educated  class as an adjunct to ruling Imperial power.It seems poetic justice <br/>

                            Problem is that we take pride in perceiving marshal content in everything political, parliamentary or the electoral. And so the vocabulary turns marshal too in reporting the matter and in behaviour. We think progress means becoming stronger; democracy means strength of speech;debate means power to dominate or the art of dominating; political sagacity means the cunning of scoring points, and the Parliament means an assembly of winners who constantly must show their winning muscles. Public speaking is reduced to rhetoric. We do not wait for the facts to speak, what we listen becomes the fact. There is only a difference in degree in the "debate" on the TV and the "debate" in the Parliament. And there lies our nativity, and yet if Mani Shankar Aiyer looks for a vernacular ideal-type of democratic norms or practice- existing or imaginary, then I do not think he is going to get that. Had he succeeded in ushering in the Panchayati Raj that his intellectual protege once spoke so eloquently about when he put the politicians of his time with the class of `limpets', a better democratic vocabulary would have risen in India out of its native sense of responsibility.
