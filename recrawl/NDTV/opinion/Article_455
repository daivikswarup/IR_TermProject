Headline::::Rahul Gandhi and Snoopgate 2 Need an Explanation



DateTime::::2015-03-16T02:37:00+05:30




                                
	(Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)
	On March 2, 2015, Assistant Sub-Inspector Shamsher Singh of the Special Branch of Delhi Police Headquarters was found sniffing around the Tughlak Lane residence of Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi, asking inane and suspicious questions. Confronted by the Special Protection Group (SPG), which protects the premises and the staff of Rahul Gandhi, to whom he was taken by the SPG, he produced a questionnaire he was carrying. This required him to obtain various particulars about Rahul Gandhi like the colour of his hair and eyes, birth marks, any disabilities or preferences, the type of clothes he wears, his shoes, photographs, and the names, addresses and phone numbers of his associates.
	On the 12th, a beat constable came by the house, and on the 14th, two police officers, an Additional DCP and an ACP, again visited the residence of Rahul Gandhi at 12, Tughlak Lane, New Delhi. They spent about seven minutes at the residence enquiring about the whereabouts of various Gandhi aides.
	The Congress Party erupted in indignation at these developments, alleging that this was a misuse of the Delhi Police personnel by the government to obtain personal information about a prominent political opponent. Given that not long ago, the "Snoopgate" scandal involved a brazen misuse of Gujarat state machinery for the surveillance of the movements of a private citizen, a young woman, the Congress' fear was that the same process might be at work at the Centre.
	The party dubbed the affair "Snoopgate2" and demanded an explanation from the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. After all, Rahul Gandhi is protected by the SPG, and has been since his childhood; why would the Delhi Police need such information about an SPG protectee, and if for some innocent reason it did, why not just ask the SPG? And why did the Police need the telephone numbers and addresses of Shri Gandhi's associates and friends?
	Faced with this controversy, the Delhi Commissioner of Police, Bhim Sain Bassi, held a press conference to state that this was a routine enquiry; a beat constable had gone not only to the residence of Rahul Gandhi but also to the residences of Veerappa Moily, PC Chacko and other political leaders. The Police Commissioner argued that the information being sought was to prevent spontaneous demonstrations at the Congress leader's residence, to ensure his security and the maintenance of law and order. The Commissioner of Police explained that various vulnerable persons are not easily identified by police officers, and it is for this reason that photographs and other descriptive details were being sought. He averred that there was no pressure from the Prime Minister or the Union government to spy upon Rahul Gandhi.
	This seemed reasonable enough on the face of it, except for a few inconvenient details. The beat constable's routine security visit to the homes of various political leaders was on March 12, the Shamsher Singh episode was on March 2. The Congress stressed it objects to the latter, not the former. Why conflate a routine visit on the 12th with a suspicious episode on the 2nd, if not to confuse and mislead the press? And can anyone seriously suggest in the Information Age that any sentient Delhi policeman would have difficulty identifying Rahul Gandhi without details of his hair, eyes and birthmarks?
	That was not all. "If spontaneous demonstrations against Shri Rahul Gandhi or other VIPs are to be prevented by police," the Party pointed out, "information must be collected regarding those persons or organizations who are likely to conduct such demonstrations", not about Rahul Gandhi and his friends. In any case, what is the logic or rationale of seeking information regarding his associates or the colour of Rahul Gandhi's hair or eyes, and how does such information help in stopping spontaneous demonstrations?
	For the Commissioner of Police to suggest that the enquiries are being made for the "safety and security of vulnerable persons like Shri Rahul Gandhi" is, to put it mildly, inconsistent with the fact that he has been an SPG protectee for nearly twenty years and is protected under the SPG Act, which leaves no role for the Delhi Police in ensuring his security and safety. How can the Delhi Police justify its spying on Rahul Gandhi in the name of assessing the security of an individual for whose security it is neither responsible nor accountable?
	The statement by the Commissioner of Police that similar information is being also sought in regard to Veerappa Moily, PC Chacko, other senior Congress leaders and senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani further raised Congress hackles: why is the Police collecting information about senior Congress and opposition leaders, and also of BJP leaders known to be opposed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi? In any event, both Veerappa Moily and PC Chacko have denied having received any security questionnaire from the Police, weakening the authorities' alibi even further.
	When I issued a series of tweets raising just some of these questions, I received the inevitable invective-laden BJP backlash, but also some reasonable-minded criticism, along the following lines:
	-- if it's true the police came openly to the house, why is this snooping?
	Isn't objectionable surveillance supposed to be clandestine?
	-- if it's true that the same pro forma has been given to other political leaders, including Congressmen like Moily or Chacko, why is this snooping?
	-- how can the information sought be misused when it is so basic and routine?
	The problem is that there were two different visits: one clandestine, one open; one as part of the routine work of the beat constable from the local police station, one from an ASI of the Special Branch. The former is fine, the latter objectionable. The ASI only revealed his questionnaire when confronted by the SPG and Rahul Gandhi's staff.
	The proforma reportedly given to other leaders has not been received by the leaders named, but in any case that is not the issue. The issue is the ASI's snooping, not the overt proforma, even though that too is unnecessary for an SPG protectee (the SPG records all such details anyway and also tracks the protectee's movements). If it was routine information the Police were after, why not send the basic questions with a formal letter from the Commissioner of Police and ask Rahul Gandhi and his staff to fill it in? Why ask an ASI to sniff around the house making enquiries?
	Finally, the question of how the information sought can be misused is best left to the imaginations of those seeking it. Far more important is the principle at stake. India is a democracy with a fragile tradition of respect for personal privacy. Surveillance, telephone-tapping, and interception of communications, are all-too-easily misused for political purposes that lie well beyond law and order or national security. While previous governments have been more or less respectful of individual privacy rights, the track record in Gujarat of the progenitors of the original Snoopgate is hardly reassuring. The Congress Party's concerns are therefore hardly overblown.
	Intrusive surveillance of political leaders is something no law permits in India. As far as the Delhi Police is concerned, they should come clean and state under which law, and under the provisions of which clause, they have carried out this procedure of inquiry against Rahul Gandhi. To what purposes would the information being collected have been put? Would the names and addresses of all of the Congress Vice-President's associates and related information be then used to elicit further information about his whereabouts, location, visits, preferences and habits? To what end?
	There are so many other issues in Delhi for the Police to be concerned about, from widespread incidents of rape and violence to the daily challenges of law and order. Surely the Delhi Police has better things to do than snooping on political leaders? But the issue goes beyond the Delhi Police, which, after all, is only following orders (though whose orders remains an open question, since the Home Minister himself seems unaware of the directive for the ASI's ill-advised expedition). It is the government that needs to explain why politicians' privacy is being invaded.
	Our Constitution allows every Indian the right to disagree strongly with the Government without being intruded upon, subjected to surveillance and inquired about intrusively in this manner. That Rahul Gandhi leads the principal opposition party makes "Snoopgate2" that much worse, but it would be a matter of concern to the Congress Party even if he were just an ordinary citizen of India.
	This is not just about Rahul Gandhi, but about all of us. It is time for the Government to come clean.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Strange Mr Tharoor. Why did Cong not object to this 16yr old questionnaire  when they were in power? Why did Rahul fill the same form in 2009 and Sonia Ji at least 5times before during IS regime?<br/>
Come on, grow up.  Protest on some substantive issues otherwise people will start ignoring Cong even on serious national issues

                            I really love this guy's audacity! Demanding an 'explanation' for an imaginary snooping scandal (Rahul Gandhi own shadow doesn't know where he is!), when he (Tharoor) needs to explain to the ND Police and the rest of the country the mysterious death of his wife! If it was any other person, that person would have been cooling his heels in a jail. In that sense, Tharoor is lucky! I also don't understand why the government should be on the back foot on this one. I am sure, Mr.Ajit Doval, the RAW, GoI know exactly where RG is introspecting for his Party at this very moment. All that the Home Minister or his Deputy should do is stand up and announce in the Parliament exactly where RG is at this moment. After all, RG is SPG protectee and he is being guarded with the tax payers money, and the tax payer has the right to know where is, if it is not a private, strictly personal visit. In which case, the tax payers should not be paying for his domestic or foreign jaunts!

                            Why RG need to have SPG protection?  Who pays for it? If Govt pays it, then this protection must be terminated. Is RG a very VIP? NOt AT ALL. Then why Congress is making lots of empty noise?<br/>
After all, RG is an empty vessel that makes lots of noise.

                            It has become quite clear that this questionnaire does not belong to Rahul Gandhi alone, but a general one to all the VVIP ministers including PM and President.  Why are you making political gains out of this.  Any lay person can understand this and learned person of your calibre should definitely know about this.  Do do want to satisfy your superiors by writing this type of articles?

                            Shashi Tharoor is a classic case where politics corrupts the intellect. The details now available in the media prove that these personal details are being collected for decades. The present pro forma itself designed by Rajiv's government.Going by Tharoor's logic it is the Congress which was snooping on its citizens for decades. By the way, Rahul is a SPG protectee. Hence SPG ( say the Government ) must be in the know of his whereabouts. Where is the need to snoop?

                            This would have been a honest opinion if he had also condemned Rahul's reckless attitude that he thinks it is not necessary to keep the people and media informed about his whereabouts. He is not ordinary citizen like me and others,but the future prime minister of India. His safety is not a privacy matter. Asking hair color and son, an ordinary citizen is asked these questions all the time in this country. Congress never bothered to remove these questions for all these years, but suddenly feel annoyed when their leader faced such questions

                            No, I'm sorry I don't buy your argument. Knowing the colour of Rahul Gandhi's eyes and hair is not going to threaten Indian democracy in any way. Now if they had determined that his brain cells were not grey, but some other colour as is widely suspected, that may have seriously threatened some people.

                            Delhi Police do not owe any explanation. As a matter of routine they sought details from a person enjoying certain privileges including security. Police collected such info from Sonia Gandhi too. What is the issue with Congress leaders? They are only becoming a laughing stock. They are past and by jacking up an undeserved by deploying cheap tricks will make the whole lot into the dust of history.

                            You see to forget that SPG is also a Indian Security Service not Italian and Modi is PM of India not a CM of a state - if he needs information on Rahul - I am sure SPG will have to provide him the same. And anyways I don't think any smart person will waste time on Rahul

                            mossad and cia are writing to delhi police to learn the subtle art of snooping by saying hello and walking to someones house. they are amazed that such simple tricks escaped them and caught the brilliance of Indian cops. JAI HIND

                            We have this state of affairs exactly because of people like you.<br/>
Seniors ministers like you had great opportunities to fix these issues<br/>
But you were too busy bickering. <br/>
Even now if you guys came back to power you will do nothing. <br/>
You will give all sorts of excuses and pass the buck.<br/>
There was rampant corruption, rapes, coal scams, 2g scams land scams<br/>
Do you remember?<br/>
You people did NOTHING. <br/>
Did not even support people on hunger strike demanding anti corruption laws.<br/>
So stop whining and do not return to politics

                            ACCORDING TO MY VIEW, BEING OUT OF POWER MANY CONGRESS LEADERS HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD TO WRITE LONG ARTICLES,WORTH NOTHING.<br/>
THE WRITERS DID NOTHING WHEN THIS PRACTICE WAS COMING DURING LARGE PART OF CONGRESS RULE.WHEN THEY SET UP THIS PRACTICE AS LAW, THERE IS NO SENSE IN ASKING THE POLICE TO QUOTE THE LAW.<br/>
I AM SURE THAT MR.RAHUL GANDHI WHEN COMES BACK WILL SHOUT AT ALL THOSE,WHO ARE MAKING IT AN ISSUE AS HE IS STRAIGHT FORWARD (I SAW HIM HIGHLY RATIONAL WHEN HE TORE OFF A PIECE OF UNWORTHY LEGISLATION)AND APPRECIATES ANY AUDIT FOR ENSURING PROTECTION.

                            Believe me you, Mr Tharoor. Rahul baba is not worth snooping on. Rahul is a loser, poor guy is just the son of a politician. Nothing more than that.

                            To be precise,this issue is being blown out of proportion and debated beyond its necessity.Time and energy is being wasted in dragging the issue when hundreds of 'real time problems' related to poverty,development and failure of cash<br/>
crops due to incessant rains are lying ahead.

                            I guess Mr Tharoor was stoned while writing this article.<br/>
4 quick points:-<br/>
1)RG is still not that important that whole house discuss about his whereabouts.<br/>
2)Same Congress party used national agencies such as RAW,IB for spying current President Mr. Pranab Da.<br/>
3)Congress party is already aware of that age old questionnaire template that Delhi police uses.<br/>
4)Mr Tharoor we all know why you are vehemently opposing actions taken by Delhi police. *pun*
