Headline::::Modi's Worldwide Nautanki of Yoga



DateTime::::2015-06-22T13:55:00+05:30




                                How appropriate that a minister with a stain on her reputation as big as the bindi on her forehead should have been sent to New York to represent India at the International Yoga Day celebrations. What should have been a day of pride for all of us has instead been turned into a Hindutva tamasha by our Events Manager to beat all Events Managers.
We certainly did not need to wait for Modi to learn that Yoga is a valuable part of the Indian heritage. An earlier Prime Minister had done so long ago. One only has to turn to pages 185-189 to discover Nehru's Discovery of Yoga. He says, "The Yoga system of Patanjali is essentially a method for the discipline of the body and the mind", then adds, "leading up to psychic and spiritual training." The link having been established between yoga and "spiritual training", it is hardly surprising that some should ask what spiritual training is being talked of - spiritual training as a broad, cosmopolitan concept, or as linked to a particular religion, perhaps the religion of Patanjali.
Nehru then remarks - and remember he is writing 70 years ago - that "Yoga is a word well-known now in Europe and America". So it did not take Modi to inform the world through his UN resolution that there was such a thing as "yoga" in the Indian heritage. That has been known, very well known, for centuries. Indeed, if it had not been known that long, it is doubtful that Modi would have found the 177 votes he got to get the UN to declare  June 21 as International Yoga Day. Actually, the UN calendar of days to commemorate has grown so long that they could not find a vacancy in the calendar to fit in a Day of Yoga; so, Yoga shares 21 June with Hydrology for marking an International Day in its honour!
It must, however, be admitted that 70 years ago, Nehru recognized that Yoga is "little understood" in the West and "is associated with quaint practices, more especially with sitting Buddha-like and gazing on one's navel". Of course, over these seven decades, dozens of Indian gurus have travelled to the West and taught them yogic postures that foreclose navel-gazing, and so most Yoga enthusiasts in the outside world now know rather more about Patanjali than they knew back then - but the credit for enlightening them surely goes to these California - and Swiss-based experts than to the Indian delegation to last year's UN session  - where they had nothing of significance to say about Palestine, but went into overdrive about Yoga. That was more akin to Nehru deriding those who teach "odd tricks for the body" to "impress and exploit the credulous and the seekers after the sensational."
Nehru praised yoga as "much more than these devices and is based on the psychological conception that by proper training of the mind certain higher levels of consciousness can be reached." He cautions, however, that "it is meant to be a method of finding out things for oneself rather than a preconceived metaphysical theory of reality or the universe." Please note the words, "finding out for oneself". Not having it imposed on the dumb masses by a diktat from above -which is what is being done by converting an essentially individual experience into world-wide theatre.
The advantage with this is, says Nehru, that Yoga "can be adapted and used by any system of philosophy, whatever its theoretical approach may be." But that presupposes that the individual, of whatever faith, comes to Yoga as a personal route to spirituality, not as a kind of wholesale "ghar wapasi". The problem with Modi's Yoga rally is that many hundreds, probably thousands, of the 35,000 participants compelled by Government to fetch up at Rajpath were not driven by personal quest, but forced by administrative fiat to attend. How anyone forced to attend a yoga session can find in it a path to "spiritual training" strains credulity. How can such force majeure "lead" as Nehru suggests it ought, "to some kind of intuitive insight or to a condition of ecstasy?" There can be no path to self-realization if yoga is imposed like a PT class on recalcitrant schoolboys.
Explaining that "this old and typical Indian method of preserving bodily fitness is rather remarkable when one compares it with the more usual methods involving rushing about, jerks, hops, and jumps which leave one panting, out of breath, and tired out", Nehru finds "poise" in yoga "and an unruffled calm even while it exercises the body". Moreover, he says, asanas"are suited to any age", leading to "a control of the senses; then comes contemplation and meditation, and finally intense concentration, which should lead to various kinds of intuition". But, of course, such noble ends are incapable of being attained if Yoga is converted from a deeply personalized experiment with Truth to a public nautanki.
Modi should have quoted Nehru to his little gathering. Especially as Nehru freely confesses to being no expert; he has picked up most of  his knowledge from Swami Vivakananda's writings, "one of the greatest modern exponents of Yoga and the Vedanta." The two are intertwined - if the goal is to be attained by understanding through reason. Nehru quotes Vivekananda: "No one of these Yogas gives up reason, no one asks you to be hood-winked, or to deliver your reason into the hands of priests of any type whatsoever". (He did not add, however, "or into the hands of Prime Ministers of any type whatsoever"!) Vivekananda added: "Each one of them tells you to cling to your reason, to hold fast to it", for "what we call inspiration is the development of reason". He concluded, "In the study of this Raja Yoga, no faith or belief is necessary. Believe nothing until you find it out for yourself." What has Vivekananda's exegesis on Yoga to do with the "Greatest Show on Earth" put up by our PM-version of an AVM studios kind of extravaganza?
Based on his study of Patanjali, Vivekananda and Aurobindo, Nehru stresses that the Yoga system is to be a form of "ethical preparation" which includes Non-violence. "Non-violence," explains Nehru, "is something much more than abstention from physical violence. It is an avoidance of malice and hatred." And this was recognized by the UN more than a decade ago when, at the instance of Sonia Gandhi and the Manmohan Singh government, the UN declared October 2 as the International Day of Non-violence. Modi forgot all about this on Gandhiji's birthday. If the ultimate aim of Yoga is to build values such as Non-violence, does not Modi ignoring October 2 to celebrate 21 June constitute a searing example of his imperfect understanding of Yoga?(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mani Shankar Iyer is NOT a fan of the BJP and surely not of the Prime Minister. However, it is high time he learns to appreciate positive things in the nation, and understand that it the People of India, fed up with a chaotic UPA II that elected the BJP to power. Sri Narendra Modi is the Prime Minister of India. If Iyer does not like to stay in an India ruled by the BJP, he has every right to migrate as a refugee to any place that accepts him. His criticism and choice of words demeans him, and the Congress. It speaks VERY POORLY of a man trying to look intelligent despite a good education.

                            Like the prior PM had clearly outlined, the current PM really knows how to present a product in its best manner. Anyways the current PM has presented something excellent to the world and a day set out for it internationally. The prior governments failure was really in its " did not know how to sell | present something in a manner understood - accepted by all". <br/><br/>
Currently we do face inflation , the middle class who pay the taxes facing the brunt of paying more than ever to live,  a slowing down economy and much more. I respect he intention of the PM but his economics is not seeing gains on the short term. Now i wish we could see the light in the tunnel.

                            MSA does not like MODI. Fact. But, for that if Modi says 5+3 =8, MSA please do not say that the calculation is not new and is there for so many years. What ever may be the justification for opposing Modi, fact remains that UN announced 21 June as Yoga Day and the first Yoga Day needs to be celebrated. Modi does not say that Yoga was invented by BJP

                            How inappropriate that a foreigner with a fake accent and dubious intent was thrust on the people of India by the servants and sycophants. How inappropriate that a dumb, hollow and fake guy who is supposedly the reincarnation of the ideas man (as disgustingly claimed time and again by the sycophant) is once again sought to be thrust upon the nation. Whereas 'sycophancia' cells constitute his blood, hatred and venom have damaged his brain cells beyond repair. Mental sickness has taken its toll and the guy mumbles garbage as and when he happens to come out  his sycophancy stupor. Yoga may have done this diseased mind some good, but then the problem is that yoga is so Hindu!

                            Brilliant! What has been happening in the name of yoga in the last one year or so is not-so-subtle religious one-upmanship and unabashed eyeing of the voters gullibility to government's red herring on yoga . Is the public so gullible as to believe that it is only in the last one year yoga has travelled outside India, although the people in power seem to be saying so by the way events are being organized and promoted People in power want to keep the public at large in a perpetual state of intellectual poverty and also make them accept lies propagated/propounded by them as great truths/ postulates

You are absolutely right. But what you are also acknowledging is the fact that there hasn't been a leader in Congress worthy of stepping into Nehru's shoes since. Give Modi his due. He is attempting to bring one of the better aspects of our heritage into mainstream consciousness of the world. That must be applauded. We must, as a nation, celebrate those things that worth celebrating as much as we strive to change the things that need changing. <br/><br/>
And seriously! Nautanki? There are enough dramatis personae in your own party that you need to be worried about. You had your chance, guys. You blew it - big time. Allow the man his due. Critique by all means but don't heap ignominies on yourselves in that pursuit.

                            The article appears to have come from a lunatic.  A person with colored glasses cannot see the actual colors.  A person, who has venom from top to bottom, can never realize the taste of nectar. OK fine, Nehru did praise Yoga and he also practiced it.  But did he try to popularize Yoga to the outer world.  He didn't.  He thought that by doing that he would be hurting the sentiments of other sects.  So, he wanted to brand him as secular.  He confined to his writings only, because most of his vote bank is illiterate and they wont understand what he said.  I do not understand the real problem with this guy or to that matter with all from Congress.  What is wrong in accepting a good thing and appreciating it even it was done by my enemy?  This is the mindset we have.  And these people want to rule the country with this narrow mindset.  If yoga has originated from India what is wrong in proclaiming that it is from Hindustan?  Whom are we afraid of to proclaim our heritage?  The people who are of the mindset like this author, are cowards.  Or they are very selfish people.  For vote bank politics, they can stoop to any level and disown their own mother.  Do we need such people in our country?  Do we need people who support such people blindly?  Do we need to care for their utterances?  Let them die in their ego, pride, etc... they don't deserve of discussing about them.

                            That Mani the moron would write a derogatory piece on the great Yoga event should have been a foregone conclusion.  However, rather like his ill-advised chaiwalla jibe, he has now abused the electorate as 'dumb masses'.  He is, of course reeling from the fact that the same 'dumb masses' gave his hero Rahul a kicking in the 2014 election.  Mani the moron is of the belief that Nehru and the dreadful parivar he has foisted on the nation are responsible for any good that happens and that all others are 'Hindutva' idiots.  Reality is that his hero Nehru was directly responsible for the greatest violence unleashed on India, partition!  Showing the old fornicator doing a headstand in a photograph which probably had a hundred 'takes' and has then been 'photoshoped' (yes, it was possible to photoshop even in those days)will not impress the average Indian of today who, unlike Mani the moron is capable of leading a normal life without the urge to be sycophantic to that dreadful parivar.  Mani has quoted extensively from 'Discovery of India' which, if Mani the moron had his way would have been made compulsory reading.  His own party's PM Narasimha Rao was derogatory about that poorly written book; Rao made clear that he did not need to 'discover' India!  Most Indians are of the same opinion.  Mani the moron will soon 'discover' that his subtle plugs for the dreadful parivar are laughable.  Yes, Mani, we did notice mention of the Italian waitress at whose 'instance' alleged PM Manmohan Singh got the UN to declare 2 October as a universal day of non-violence.  No mention of the fact that this was done some 60 years after that other 'partitioner', Gandhi had kicked the bucket.  As for the underhanded comment about Yoga day being shared with hydrology, well Mani in his sycophantic stupor has obviously failed to notice that there were no mega hydrology events in dozens of countries.  There was no hydrology-thon in Taiwan as there was a yogathon, there was no mass hydrology practice in Times Square, New York, nor at the Eiffel Tower in Paris and believe me, representatives from 84 countries did not attend any hydrology event in Raj Path.

                            So you most definitely will be against the gym-culture. Don't u realize that giving it such an official international platform will help some people find out why so many ppl are on the streets in the rains, so enthused to do the asanas. It could be vying with the multi million gym industry but this is a debate for a different day. Lets noy commodify this since ur not a businessman and I presume not your angle of interest here. It is a first step on a public scale and it isn't wrong. What is politics if not executed on a public scale. By your logic, everything is nautanki. However, all of it is a step by step progression(think of the first political thought you had when you were younger Sir, you considered it the truth and not nautanki that u had these self-thoughts then, didn't u?) and enthusiasm is good progress. Lastly, being in the foreign relations setup Sir I find it a little bit funny that you would consider this attempt of endorsing something that shows off our cultural ethos rather than our important political stances on issues of the world as nautanki. This dismissive attitude is unnecessary because a) there's nothing wrong with it because it's achieved a truly massive scale. Im purposefully ignoring the comments the leaders have to say about it in the negative, yes, even PM's comment on not commodifying it needs to be ignored because it never is about that. Everybody is enthused anyway and given a chance for it to be infectious is actually most welcome

                            Why does Mr.Aiyar not have one word to say about the Muslims who refused to participate in Yoga saying it's promotion of Hindutva. Since congress agree's with everything the muslims say, does this mean that Chacha Nehru was communal &amp; promoting Hindutva? Will the learned Mr.Aiya please clarify?<br/><br/>
Is it secularism when India's second largest majority see's religion in everything &amp; refuses to participate in a Indian tradition? If on July 17, Modi does not give iftaar party on Eid will Mr.Aiyar say it's okay to do so and that no one should be forced to celebrate Eid if they don't want to? Will the Owaisi's and Randeep Surjewala's mouth the same crap of freedom of choice &amp; no one should be forced to celebrate anything?

                            Aiyer is old enough to know the difference between publicity and nautanki. The fact that he dies of envy at every successful publicity campaign of Modi's, and does not bother to hide it either, makes his columns highly entertaining. His gods have all run away to London unable to bear the summer heat. Which the common man is unable to do. You see not everyone has an unlimited supply of money. Perhaps Aiyer should have followed his gods rather than vent his spleen on Modi and yoga. And avoid airing his smelly views. And the usual quotations from Nehru. Here he has no choice, since nobody else in the family after Indira had the intelligence to come up with worthwhile quotes. Suit boot sarkar does not qualify as a quote. Sorry.

All of us know that Yoga is there since  thousands of years, and PM is just promoting yoga , which is good. its several billion dollar industry and we Indians share only a nominal part of that. If taken seriously India can contribute and control the Industry. Even if practiced can improve a person mentally and physically irrespective of creed and religion.

You should stop cribbing like a teenager. Just because you belong to the other end of political spectrum does not mean you should hem and haw 'compulsorily' about every positive development that your party could not bring about. Nehru's 'deep understanding' and expertise of yoga not withstanding, Modi's efforts, among other tangible-intangible benefits, has projected India's soft power far and beyond.<br/>
Yoga, a benign and beneficial phenomenon, has succeeded in uniting the world for a noble cause in times of chaos and that an Indian leader has been the agent provocateur is a matter of pride if one prides in being an Indian. Wonder why you are so depressed. At least congratulate the man for his successful efforts.<br/>
How do you know that 35000 people were dragged out to Rajpath? For every single person on Rajpath, there were hundreds following Modi in front of their television sets. That it is difficult for a political rival to stomach is understandable but at least try to do some 'nautanki' for some semblance of dignity. Tell me you were not coerced by the high command to conjure up this nonsense. Such mindless diatribe will eventually go in Modi's favour and against you.﻿

Is that idea that Yoga can be made fit into the world calendar as "Yoga Day" ever came to the so called intellectuals of his clan??? When someone did it, admit that you and your clan are not capable of taking such mega initiative and take a bow instead of public bickering here. Your mind and thoughts are outdated. Does not work for us youngsters. You are better off writing in congress mouthpiece if they have one instead of polluting the public space and losing your self respect! If you or your PA goes through the comment section in your article, you would know what kind of public opinion are formed by such idiotic, moronic, senseless article written to get political mileage. If you continue this nuisance congress won't even get 10 seats in the next general election. In today's India public opinion can only be formed by dominating the youngsters mind. Imagine even what would be the case after another 5 years! People like you are becoming irrelevant in our society. Your Marxis't, Lennin's era idea don't work for us.

                            Mr.Mani s Iyer, Have you participated on Yoga day? If not, you have no moral right to talk about Yoga.You only defined Violence as avoidance of Malice and Hatred.Why so much of hatred towards our Prime Minister.He claims that our ancient Rishis only taught Yoga and wanted to glorify the Indian Culture all over the world to bring universal Peace by people practicing Yoga.The whole world accepted this.Even an intellectual like Nehruji practiced and preached. You should do proper Yoga to get rid of illwill about others. We all praise Modiji for his positivity in any approach.Expenditure on this event is nothing considering the reduction in the medical expenditure by practice of yoga. Have you seen Children running to take blessings of Modiji and how dare you say people are forcefully brought.INDIANS today are very Wise and you people can no longer fool them as you did in the past.OLD order changeth yielding place to New.

                            Nehru, Nehru, Nehru, Nehru, Nehru......... Hello dear Manishankarji, here also you started doing politics. Perhaps you would have been very happy if yesterday's whole credit regarding Yoga had been given to Nehru. Do you think Nehru was the first person to say people the valuable aspects of yoga? We do not give this credit to Modiji either. Why do not you digest the fact that Modi's attempt made yoga supported by UNO and other 192 countries? Now people around the world know yoga associated with India not with BJP or Congress party. Being a part of opposition party does not mean to oppose everything of the ruling party. Do not give cynical comments and love things at least as common man of this country.

                            How appropriate this gutter mouth who got back so much of his digressed opinions proven wrong. When he said Mr. Modi can only sell tea. Sir, you go and attend your Rahul G's birthday and wash his chappals and promote the foolish idiot who after this much of family backup could not achieve anything substantial just like being a diplomat and using your super intelligence, you were just a decorated member of Rajya Sabha (as quoted by Subramiamswamy you can't even win an election and top of that open your gutter mouth every where). Don't even have still any shame despite being proven wrong so many times. You were close to Rajiv Gandhi we all know and also he got a gr8 majority and he fell down to big election loss after that and Rajiv was yet another Rahul only as he got the post as his ancestral property, so you cannot be much proud of that also. <br/>
Do some introspection, you are 70+ years old man, better retire and spend life calmly as you are only a waste fellow who wants to be in limelight by these kind of comments.

                            The only asana MSA knows is Pavanmuktasana (Hot Air Release Asana) which he does with unfailing regularity. Keep doing this MSA..this is good for your health.

                            Moorkh ShikaMani- Your great leader's great Grandpa was doing "Sheershaasan", as true follower of this political dynasty family, you should at least do "Shavaasan" to express your loyalty and gratitude.That will also spare the readers of NDTV blogs from reading nonsense.It is despicable  that you chose to call NaMo's led  "WORLD YOGA DAY" as "Nautanki",  while the whole world is celebrating  with vigor and zeal. You are so much rotten intellectually, and politically.
