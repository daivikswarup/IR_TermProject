Headline::::Pappu and Feku - the Best We Can Do?



DateTime::::2015-04-20T23:32:00+05:30



(Critical theorist and writer Rukmini Bhaya Nair is a professor at IIT Delhi. She is the author of several academic books and has been PI of a DST project on 'Language, Emotion and Culture'. She is currently leading another ICSSR project on 'The Capabilities Approach to Education: Access, Equity and Quality.')
Societies across the globe indicate respect for others through forms of language. In India, these customs are particularly rich. Pronouns like 'aap' as well as common endings of verbs such as 'aaiye', 'baithiye', 'suniye' (come, sit, listen) in Hindi and other Indian languages all convey especial deference. Indeed, this is a culture where 'ji', deriving from the Sanskrit 'sri' which denotes divinity, is routinely added to people's names to signal that everyone is worthy of the highest honour.
 
I want to ask where these great traditions of courtesy have gone in our political life today. Recall, if you will, our freedom movement. There was a wide spectrum of opinions then about how exactly independence was to be achieved, just as there are bitter conflicts now among our current politicians about the directions in which India should go. Tagore and Gandhi, for instance, disagreed on the definition of key concepts like nationalism and argued publicly and vehemently about the interpretation of events like the great Bihar earthquake of 1934. Subhas Chandra Bose's views could not be said to be exactly consonant with Jawaharlal Nehru's - and so on. Yet, each of these political personalities had a unique honorific associated with them in the public mind. Laden with symbolism, these epithets remain highly emotive. Let me begin by drawing attention to a dozen such:  
 
Mahatma Gandhi, the Great Soul
Kavi Guru Rabindranath Tagore, the Wise Poet
Babasaheb Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, Gentlemanly Protector
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Authoritative Leader
Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Respected by the People
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the Scholar
Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Liberated Individual
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Honoured Leader
Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, Friend of the Nation
Deenabandhu C.F. Andrews, Friend of the Poor
Shahid Bhagat Singh, Martyr
Veer Savarkar, Brave One
Sarojini Naidu, the Nightingale of India
 
It is true that my translations of these honorific adjectives into English are woefully inadequate, and the list I've presented far from complete. For example, leaders from the South are not mentioned though they contributed immensely to the freedom struggle. Also obvious is the fact that men are far more prominent than women in this list - which may tell us something about the long reign of patriarchy in our country.
Nevertheless, despite these lacunae, the general point holds. School children across India will unfailingly recognize these honour-tags as part of the legendary associations of freedom itself, of 'swaraj'. Where is that vision of swaraj now? Fossilised in text-books? Gone with the wind?
 
It is not a question of the absolute 'truth' of those long-ago nationalist labels. There are no doubt ample reasons for in-depth critiques of each of them by historians. What is worth noting, however, is that not only were these appellations coined, but that they have robustly held sway over public memory for over a century. Then, we had a great soul, a poet and a martyr and even a 'nightingale' as part of the political imagination.
 
And today?
 
Well, the present seems to be the age of the caricature. 'Pappu' and 'Feku' are the best we can manage. I do not want to come down too heavily on the side of political correctness here. A nation that cannot take irreverence in its stride cannot, I believe, come to terms with real reverence either.
 
My point is simply that Sarojini Naidu, the Nightingale of India, who unabashedly wrote her wonderful, passionate poetry in the language of the colonizer, was able to make merciless fun of the Mahatma, calling him a Mickey Mouse and commenting that it cost more to send him around the country in his Third Class railway carriage than in First Class. No one at the time - or now - seemed to assess these as mean, below-the-belt hits. Least of all the Mahatma.
 
Likewise, there was no bar against foreigners like 'Deenabandhu' C.F. Andrews being accepted as an integral part an Indian front fighting for the rights of the dispossessed. No talk of 'ghar wapsi', no resistance to including people of all religions as part of our national pantheon, or to making a Dalit the chief architect of our Constitution. Even Bankim Chandra, we might remind ourselves, wrote his famously seditious novel, 'Anandamath', with its rousing 'Vande Mataram' anthem, while working as a Deputy Magistrate for the colonial government! Such are the marvels of our democratic inheritance.
 
All of this sophisticated understanding of plural perspectives, of cross-cultural learning, of tolerance of other's points of view even under the colonial yoke, back then was arguably so for at least two reasons: first, because it appears there was a great deal of mutual respect and trust between public figures - and in them. These politicians were not too eager, it seems, to jump to conclusions about bad faith, nor to accuse each other of corrupt practices moment to moment. The people, in their turn, seemed to respect the honorifics bestowed on their leaders. Second, there was a vision animating both people and leaders: this was the vision of Indian independence.
 
Today, that solid edifice of mutual respect amongst our politicians seems eroded. Trust is at a very low ebb. If we have common goals, they are lost in shrill cacophony. Vision has given way to division, with even 'idealistic' parties like AAP split right down the middle in a very short time after being voted in with an impressive majority. It is as if we have quite lost our ability to listen respectfully to each other owing to far too much sensory overload.
 
Twitter and troll environments in our times just do not seem to permit those 'honourable' political discourses of the past, only revengeful themes and fast, vicious responses. Maybe it is the 24X7 media mill, maybe it is the machinery of the markets, maybe it is that politics is all screen-spectacle these days. Whatever the reasons, pettiness rather than wit seems to prevail in our present political discourse.
 
Or perhaps it's just that our times are incapable of imagining the 'heroic' except through the magic intervention of Bollywood. However, this is a conclusion that I am loathe to endorse. My view is that India is a dynamic country with a very young population which deserves truthful as well as entertaining accounts of the challenges facing us. We may have come a long way from the times of the freedom movement, but India still needs freedom from dire poverty, illiteracy, gender abuse, caste factionalism, regional prejudice. In these times of social 'churn', I therefore think our politicians still have a crucial lesson to learn from our past: they must respect each other - and us, the aam janta - just a wee bit more.
 
At the moment, our politicians are outdoing themselves trying to disgrace their peers. What's needed from them is the exact opposite - grace and generosity. If a more coherent vision of the future of India fifty years down the line emerges from this exercise, that would be great. But if not, our political leaders should at least do us the honour of telling us the truth.
And speaking of telling the truth, I must confess I have been trying hard to think of honorifics we might wish to confer on our current leaders. It hasn't been easy.

                            Difference is clear. freedom fighter or anyone else they were fighting for country. not for their own power. but now our politician's are fighting for their own banifint. in 5 years who will earn how much. if congress earned something by corruption. then BJP will earn more then congress by commission from corporate houses. next time again congress will come then they will loot again. so its a fight of their own benefit not for country. that's why we see more personal attacks by politician. One more thing I want to add here those prefreedom leaders were hero of the nation. today's leaders are like leeches who are sucking the blood of country.

                            Well written. Its time for people to get a meaningful life and grow beyond Feku and Pappu. No leader should be made a demi god. Objective analysis of their actions and words is the need of the hour and not this childish personal name calling.

                            An article worth reading, salute to its writer!  Today, we are living in a country where respect is unknown.  Short-cut &amp; Quick money concept has replaced our values altogether.  Who is responsible for this?  60years of Congress rule if you evaluate with an open mind, where do we stand today?  People have become mad on High Command model and Dynastic rule where there is no LEADER today to reign the power. India need LEADER to rule ensuring a better life to its citizens. Unfortunately, the Dynasty family lost the Leadership.  10 years of congy rule has spoiled our country, thanks to the nature, bringing Modi to power with a vast majority.  when the people of India recognised the need, the chamchas of dynastic family unable to come to an understanding.  Am not saying Modi has brought lot of changes to this country for the last 10 months of his rule, but we need to remember, the 10 years of congy rule has devastated our country, and it may need some more time.  Again, am not supporting Modi for all his action, yes, there are better approach required at the part of Modi as well, as our expectations are more.  Just imagine, another 5 more years had the Dynasty got the power to rule, what could have been our fate?  You answer urself and satisfy.We still need improved governance, hope the NDA would look into the lapses, and correct themselves. Let's learn RESPECT OTHERS irrespective of Friend or Foe...Let's retain our Great Indian Culture thereby.

                            agree, we have a poor track record. for this reason our stats are shameful, shocking (infrastructure, socio economic, welfare etc). <br/><br/>
Even IIT educated Politicians like Arvind are proving to be a HUGE disappointment without even talking of his $400,000 funding by Ford Foundation.<br/><br/>
Since WW2 many countries have risen like phoenixes, and India cannot even provide enough food, roads, water. Are we inherently a poor country? with 1 million $millionaires, largest importer of military kit, huge natural resources, people resources......or we just lack the vision, drive, ability?<br/><br/>
Why is it this way? Why do we keep making 30 years old promises, again and again, and not deliver?<br/><br/>
There seems to be one sad, yet perhaps true, answer: We Indians lack Ethics?

                            Probably not! But the media is desperately trying to promote Mr Prince(Pappu) to have some (weak) opposition against Mr Feku. But the world of politics has moved on...it is time for action but these two are busy fighting it out on TV. On the other hand Kejriwal is currently the man of action. It is going to be pretty difficult for the media to try to fool people twice -come LokSabha 2019 elections these two are history and Arvind will be PM of India.

                            An article worth serious consideration, in the context of the low level and meanness of the language (of abuse, sometimes followed by half-hearted apologies, after the damage is done) used by the lawmakers of the country today. It is a matter of shame for Indians, especially who live abroad, when confronted with the remarks by the people of that country, pointing at the ridiculous abusive language used by top politicians and lawmakers of India. The worst was the abusive language showered by BJP leaders incuding Modiji, upon Dr Manmohan Singh, the most learned and respected (by foreign dignitories from  IMF and UN agencies)PM, India ever had. Then started the Pappu-Feku ordeal, which are highly condemnable. Hope some good sense will prevail on the politicians, taking cues from this article.

                            Appreciate the eloquent prose but what is not stated in your blog is that the underlying issue is complete distrust of the polity. Few in the country actually believe that politicians at large are there for the greater good. I do not know if the public figures of yesteryears were less corrupt. Today's politician is definitely very blatant about it.

                            A very good article to read. Like the way you urge respectfully. Respect is what I have for you. In a civilized society of a great and growing nation we must not lose the idea of grace and poise in public space be it any profession or vocation, even politics. Respect is a basic necessity and the truth is nobody likes to be disrespected.  Being cut-throat and taking jibes does not promote a healthy culture either for the opposition or the party in power, especially not when the front men stoop to lower standards. Modi and Gandhi have to be respected for who they are; it's that simple for me. I respect people for whoever that are and I don't have to always be decisive about who deserves and does not because they are both people's representatives. It doesn't matter what their backgrounds are or their history is. In good faith i am respectful to both. I hope they do the same with each other and their parties and promote a clean and healthy political atmosphere in the centre. Least I can expect.

                            People like the Mahatma, Pandit Nehru etc were part of the freedom movement and did not get to play a big role as "elected" representatives of the people. It is the competitive nature in which elections are contested that makes for all the mud-slinging slander and name-calling we see today.  You can see this sort of behavior in any competitive endeavor, be it in sports or in the corporate world. Competitors have two ways of winning: 1) Do better than your competition 2) Make your competition look bad. When competition is rightly structured, we get less of the latter kind and more of the former. For example, sports like cricket and tennis, issue fines or bans for aggressive behavior that crosses the line. But boxing on the other-hand, especially in the 80s, was so badly regulated that the off-the-ring clashes were as much a spectacle as the actual match itself. It took the biting off of Hollifield's ear to get Tyson finally banned. I am of the opinion that our election commission should be further strengthened so that they can take sterner action against politicians who cross the line. They should be able to issue bans or fines, especially when something is caught on tape and is easily verifiable. This should also help in elevating the standard of the names our politicians call each other.

                            The whole thing was started by these Congi thugs especially that loser Sanjay Jha. Modi avenged his insult by throwing that gang out of power and reduced them to Rahul Baba and 43 chor. Modi is now PM, this is what we wanted him to become rest of the the congi slaves and Pakistanis bad mouthing him doesn't matter anymore nor your superfluous concern Ms Author.

                            It is easy to keep writing articles and share opinions -- then to meet foreign prime ministers, CEO's of multi-national companies and discuss growth plans and seek investment into India. It may happen, may be not, but atleast Modi is trying his best and hopeful of India's growth. The author probably hasn't met any industrialist or PM's in 10 years and writing articles from her living room. She has no idea what it takes to do business -poor authorship.

                            if media was as active as today in days of gandhiji, he would not have got away with such high images. All are human beings with faults. Nobody is god or angel. The reason we dont have leaders like the past is not because people became bad. It is because now we know the faults of our leaders as well.

                            Quite fashionable to blame leaders they did not drop down from Mars or Venus they are products of our own society. And this so called deterioration did not take place in in the last few years it has been consistently going downhill from independence, so some of the blame should be shared by all concerned. And yes using derogatory language for a sitting PM just reflects the depths that even the writer has succumbed to, the very reason that she is writing about.

                            Unlike the previous times,politicians stand exposed - they have two faces one for the public domain &amp; another for personal which are poles apart.Anyone who followed Indian politics can easily see,that there was always a rumor mill in action to keep Modi down.Modi was made to be called Feku by journalists who reported false stories,(for which they ran 'apologies' in the last pages).A natural reaction to this was the title of 'Pappu' to Rahul who rose to power just because of his 'birth',not because of his abilities.

                            Interesting observation. But I am sure answer lies there in. From the list of year years leaders you mentioned in the article, one common theme across is, all of them are achievers and then turned leaders in public life, hence they have high adjectives. But the current leaders are there what they are due to their birth in to a family, and they do not often have even average Indian education, let alone high achievements, so calling Pappu is apt and reasonable in my view. I guess Ramachandra Guha mentioned in one of his commentary, the honor of Nehru is reduced greatly because of his descendants, the family should introspect and choose to retire from politics to avoid such damage to them selves.

                            जंतर-मंतर पर आयोजित आम आदमी पार्टी की रैली में गजेंद्र सिंह कल्याणवत नाम के एक शख्स ने खुदकुशी कर ली। गजेंद्र राजस्थान के दौसा जिले के एक गांव के रहने वाले थे। हालांकि गजेंद्र को किसान बताया जा रहा है लेकिन वो महज किसान नहीं थे बल्कि सामाजिक और राजनीतिक रूप से काफी सक्रिय और समृद्ध थे। यहां तक कि वो विधानसभा चुनाव भी लड़ चुके थे।<br/>
गजेंद्र सिंह कल्याणवत मूल रूप से दौसा जिले के बांदीकुई विधानसभा इलाके के रहने वाले थे। वो युवावस्था से ही अपने चाचा गोपाल सिंह नांगल के साथ राजनीति में सक्रिय थे। नांगल प्रधान और सरपंच भी रह चुके थे। गजेंद्र ने बीजेपी के साथ राजनीति की शुरुआत की। वो बीजेपी के स्थानीय कार्यक्रमों में भागीदारी करते रहते थे और चुनाव लड़ने की ख्वाइश भी रखते थे। 2003 में जब बीजेपी की तरफ से गजेंद्र सिंह को टिकट नहीं मिला, तो उन्होंने समाजवादी पार्टी का दामन थाम लिया।<br/>
गजेंद्र सिंह कल्याणवत ने सपा का दामन थामते ही 2003 का विधानसभा चुनाव लड़ा, जिसमें उनको बीजेपी की अल्का सिंह से हार का मुंह देखना पड़ा। गजेंद्र इसके बाद भी राजनीति में डटे रहे। उन्होंने 2013 तक सपा में रहकर राजनीति की। इस दौरान गजेंद्र ने सपा जिलाध्यक्ष से लेकर प्रदेश कार्यकारिणी सदस्य तक का सफर तय किया। हालांकि 2013 में उन्होंने विधानसभा टिकट मिलने की आस में कांग्रेस का दामन थाम लिया। लेकिन जब कांग्रेस में गजेंद्र सिंह की अनदेखी की गई, तो वो आम आदमी पार्टी के करीब आ गए।<br/>
बताया जाता है कि गजेंद्र सिंह घरेलू कलह से जूझ रहे थे और घर से निकाल दिए गए थे। गजेंद्र ने अपने सुसाइड नोट में भी इस बात की तरफ इशारा किया है, जिसमें उन्होंने लिखा है कि मेरे पिता ने मुझे घर से निकाल दिया है। दरअसल, गजेंद्र के परिवार में किसी लड़की की शादी थी, लेकिन घर से निकाले जाने की वजह से वो दुखी थे।<br/>
गजेंद्र सिंह जयपुरिया साफे का कारोबार करते थे। उन्होंने देश-दुनिया के नामचीन लोगों को अपने हाथों से साफा पहनाया था, जिनमें बिल क्लिंटन, नेपाल के राष्ट्रपति परमानंद, मुरली मनोहर जोशी, अटल बिहारी वाजपेयी जैसी हस्तियां शामिल हैं। गजेंद्र सिंह इस कला में इतनी महारत रखते थे कि वो एक मिनट में 12 लोगों के सिर पर पगड़ी बांध देते थे। इसके अलावा गजेंद्र 33 स्टाइल की पगडियां बांधने में भी निपुण थे। अपने कारोबार को बढ़ाने के लिए उन्होंने बाकायदा वेबसाइट भी बनाई थी, तो फेसबुक जैसे ऑनलाइन प्लेटफॉर्म पर भी वो सक्रिय थे।

disappointed to see an academician makes similar remarks.<br/><br/>
It is surprising that these people do not see that India has never seen a leader<br/>
of his caliber. Indeed Gandhi and Bose were exceptional mass leaders. But Mr Modi <br/>
is an exceptional man who can lead a massive country  like India from 19th century to 21st century. It is an impossible to function is a democratic setup when majority votes on irrational basis. These commentators only add to the difficulty of those who are working so hard for this nation by spewing poison and stupidity.

                            Yet another flood of words in this long meandering article without getting to the point!  So that Rukmini knows, Gandhi was just plain Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi until Tagore came along and decided to confer the honorific Mahatma, 'Great Soul' to him.  Hardly anyone outside North India knows that Mahatma means Great Soul; people still think it is Gandhi's first name.  Sarojini Naidu was given the accolade 'Nightingale of India by Nehru who was, shall we say closely involved with her daughter Padmaja, who Nehru later appointed Governor of West Bengal.  Nobody referred to Sarojini Naidu as Bulbul Sarojini Naidu as Bulbul is Hindi for nightingale.  Pandit Nehru refers to Nehru's caste; he was not even remotely a scholar but just a plain lawyer!  Rukmini should know that in UK people always refer to fellow parliamentarians as 'the Honourable member for xx ' or, if they have been Cbinnet Ministers 'the Right Honourable member for xx'  Similarly in a UK Court, fellow lawyers are referred to as 'my learned friend'.  In the US political protagonists refer to each other by their positions, e.g. Senator of Governor.  Those with manners in India refer to protagonists as 'mananiya'.  As far as Feku and Pappu are concerned, these are epithets coined by the dirty tricks departments of the respective parties.
