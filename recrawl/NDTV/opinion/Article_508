Headline::::Modi's Second Swipe at Secularism While Abroad



DateTime::::2015-04-14T23:43:00+05:30



(Siddharth Varadarajan is a senior journalist and analyst.)
Since Narendra Modi became Prime Minister last May, he has criticized, or mocked, 'secularists' and secularism in India on two occasions. Strangely, each time while speaking to NRIs on foreign soil.
Last year in Tokyo he said that his gift of the Gita to the Japanese emperor was likely to trigger a controversy back home. "Our secular friends will create a 'toofan' (storm) that what does Modi think of himself?" he claimed. "He has taken a Gita with him that means he has made this one also communal."
Now in Berlin, the Prime Minister has blamed (false notions of) "secularism" for neglecting the use of Sanskrit in India. "There was a time when German radio used to have a bulletin in Sanskrit..but not in India...where there is such a storm over secularism that even Sanskrit has been roped into the controversy" the PM was quoted by NDTV as saying. Modi went on to suggest that respect for secularism and Sanskrit cannot go hand in hand. India's secularism is not so weak that it will be shaken just because of a language," he said.
I have written earlier on ndtv.com about Modi's Gita comment but before I get into the merits of his argument on Sanskrit, I want to raise a small point of information. Earlier this year, his government moved hell and high water to prevent a young woman, Priya Pillai, from going to London to criticise an Indian mining project before a foreign audience. So isn't it hypocritical for Modi to target secularism, a guiding principle of the constitution and polity of India, when he's abroad?
Pillai, who works for Greenpeace India, was stopped from boarding her flight at Delhi airport and the word "Offloaded" was stamped on her passport. She later found that the Intelligence Bureau and Ministry of Home Affairs had issued a look-out circular against her. Mercifully, the Delhi High Court rejected the absurd arguments presented by the Modi government to the effect that citizens are free to travel only if they do not indulge in any "anti-India agenda". If it is "anti-India" to criticize a mining project or the pursuit of "growth", why it is not considered "anti-India" to criticize secularism? On Twitter, Modi bhakts have rushed to his defence, claiming the PM was attacking not secularism but pseudo-secularism and 'sickularists'. But Greenpeace could easily say it is attacking only 'pseudo-growth' and corporate skullduggery, and not the actual development prospects of the country, as the government has alleged.
As far as I'm concerned, I welcome a healthy debate wherever it may take place. If the PM or Priya Pillai want to argue about the Mahan mining project or the relationship between Sanskrit and secularism in London, Berlin or Delhi, so be it.
Let us now consider the facts. Germany launched Radio Deutsche Welle's language programmes for non-German audiences worldwide in the 1950s and added Sanskrit to its bouquet of broadcasts beamed at India at some point in the 1960s. Why did it do so? Perhaps to add novelty value at a time when Indian listeners were more likely to tune in to BBC, Radio Moscow or even Radio Ceylon (which was the only contemporary broadcast source for the forbidden fruit of Hindi film music thanks to the puritanism of All India Radio). The fact that Germany had a long tradition of scholarship in Sanskrit would have made the task easier.
In India, the official Sanskrit Commission set up by the 'secular' Nehru government in 1956 made a series of recommendations, including the promotion of Sanskrit in the private and public media. According to All India Radio old-timers, however, the public broadcaster's news bulletins in Sanskrit started only in 1974, when Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister. This was around the same time, ironically, that the Congress leader was busy amending the constitution to introduce the word 'secular' in the preamble! While 'secularism' or 'pseudo-secularism' may or may not have prevented Sanskrit broadcasts in the past, we can say with some degree of certainty that it does not appear to have been an impediment from 1974 onwards.
So what prompted Modi to stir up this pointless, muddle-headed debate on secularism and Sanskrit during a trip that was otherwise meant to be about promoting 'Make in India'? Could it be because of the bruising controversy triggered last year by his government's hasty decision to replace the teaching of German in Kendriya Vidyalaya schools with Sanskrit in the middle of the academic year? Perhaps. But then why praise Germany for respecting an ancient Indian language (and attacking Indian 'secularism' for not) if we have nothing to show in return other than the gutting of a popular teaching programme for German? Or could it be that Modi, despite the conscious image makeover of the past year, simply dislikes the 'S' word and gives vent to this allergy when abroad because it is less likely to create a controversy back home than a comparable statement made in India?
Classical languages are a treasured part of our national heritage and should be taught in school, not as a substitute for modern Indian and foreign languages but for their intrinsic value. Sanskrit may not be spoken any more, but the language spawned an enormous volume of philosophical, poetic, dramatic, political, religious and scientific literature, only a fraction of which has so far been translated. Future generations of Indian scholars can and must be trained to read and translate this literature, and the government must take every step to ensure this happens. But what Modi must not do is mix up this important national goal with the battles he wants to fight over Hindutva and secularism. Fight those battles by all means. But please don't make Sanskrit a pawn.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            This article is an example of an overeducated and biased writer with too much time on his hand.  He is needlessly argumentative and picking a fight where this is none.  Mr. Modi is not making teaching of Sanskrit a political pawn, it is the author's ilk such as Congress et. al. who are.  This author is simply confused.  On the one hand, he says honor Sanskrit.  On the other, he says, yeah, but not if Modi wants to honor Sanskrit.  The anti-national left is simply looking for a stick with which to beat Modi.  Unfortunately for them, Mr. Modi is not ashamed to be an Indian.  India has a thousands of year old tradition of not just tolerating but embracing diverse religions and peoples.  The author and his ilk would like us all to believe that diversity is under threat in Modi's India.  Nothing could be further from the truth.

                            Your article proves the point that Modi is making. Modi grew up as a hindu and has every right to practice his beliefs (just like any other person of any religion). If Modi goes to a temple and donates his personal money, media will criticize him for promoting only one religion. He knows this. That is why when he gave "Gita" as a gift or wants to promote Sanskrit language in India, he has to say to the media (including the author of this article) in a sarcastic manner that please do not criticize me. Worst part of this is that writer knows this but he has to criticize Modi to please his masters! We understand!

                            Meaning of secularism in India : denial of the fact that India is a historical civilisation with a certain culture and philosophical framework (now known as Hindu). The birth land of Islam(middle east) : theocracy, the epicentre of Catholicism (Italy): Christian nation. The birth land of dharma (present day India): 'secular' (which in India means any attempt to acknowledge our collective. Dharmic legacy and identity has to be suspected as 'fascism') It's madness.

                            The swipe is not at secularism but at the distorted form of secularism of the Communists and left liberals like the writer. Secualriam in India has been used as a tool to denigrate anything Hindu while building on vote bank politics and indulging in minortyism and carrying rampant conversions under its garb.

                            Swipe on pseudo secularism, not on secularism. Take off your glasses...please. Wasn't the German and Sanskrit issue raised up here and comments were made about India's relationship with Germany. So it should be correct to address it at Germany....or was it all hyped up comments here?

                            NDTV as usual promotes only minority rights of one minority. As a Jain minority in the North East, I have been the target of reverse discrimination in Congress's India. Atleast, the existing government works for only one kind of India, and one kind of community - the human community. In Congress's India, one has to be born of only one type of a community to gain subsidies or access to government schemes which should be done away with. If you really want India to be secular - implement the Uniform Civil Code.

                            Here are the differences mr vardarAjan <br/>
1. The speech was for indians and not German MPs. <br/>
2. Nobody cares what language kids wanna learn. The whole point was tax payers money was being used to teach german against protocol. Either change the norms or pay out of pocket if you wanna learn foreign language. <br/>
3. Both times PM was absolutely right. So called intellectuals like you have corrupted the true meaning of secularism in India (and you are not even an indian citizen!!) <br/>
4.  The IB report on NGOs was from UPA time. You conveniently leave that fact in each article. Well you the art of spinning facts!! <br/>
5. Why is greenpeace not so active in China? Whole world knows what's going in China? Or is it only in India that environment is in danger? Is it not in danger in Australia, the biggest mining country? <br/>
6. Isn't it surprising that instead of helping tribals educate and grow economically, greenpeace wastes millions in Propaganda? <br/>
I can go on. You get the picture, hopefully.

                            India is secular not because of any constitution or Nehru or so called intellectuals like the writer. India is secular because it is a Hindu majority nation and Sanskrit is part of that legacy. Stop your bile sir will do your health good.

                            When the UPA government introduced German instead of Sanskrit it was done through the back door, and the decision was contrary to the prevailing 3 language policy. If the UPA wanted to change this, they should have been upfront about it and changed the policy publicly. Obviously they did not dare to do this as there would have been an appropriate backlash. What this government has done is to just reverse a wrong decision. However, the paid media of which I presume you too belong given the tone and tenor of this column went berserk and went hammer and tongs against Minister Irani. All Modi has done now is to remind the likes of you about your stupidity and ignorance.

                            Only on NDTV you can mix up secularism, language and green peace. And use all that to criticize Modi. <br/><br/>
The fact that you are clubbing Green peace with political criticism, it's obvious that green peace is not an apolitical organization.<br/><br/>
Also, I think NDTV has been the biggest contributor to promote "sickularism". you have followed an agenda to demonize Indian majority saying that minorities are in threat. But you have failed to reveal the facts once the cases have been probed. The Bengal-nun rape incident was done by a Bangladeshi muslim migrant. One of the Delhi's church attacks were by a drunk stone pelters. Another hyped church attack turned out to be a theft, were thieves were later caught and found to be mix of religions. None of that turned out to be an attack by the majority community. But of course, NDTV would not care to present that. And here comes another secular warrior.

If you are an honest Indian, answer this simple question: is secularism meant for only the Hindu population as both the Church and Islam have "rejected" secularism. So columnists like you and TV channels shouting secularism at every foolish statement from any Hindu only keep quiet when an Azam Khan or Owaisi challenges the very sovereignty or democracy of India. Would you be satisfied if Hindus are exterminated a la the repeat of Hindukush?or the holocaust in Catholic Hitler's Germany

                            No surprises here.. Somehow so called "intellectuals", English Media and Leftist Historians have failed this country for years so I take this as a continuation of this aspect only. It is following age old tradition (from Mr. Nehru's time) to endorse western views at the cost of our culture and values.. By his own terms Nehru setup a mission on promoting Sanskrit in 1956 and then the Sanskrit News were started in 1974 (18 years sir!). Why didn't he questioned Mr. Nehru or Mrs. Gandhi to not set up a Sanskrit University or made Sanskrit a mandatory language in school since independence.. It was only a touch up else they could have acted with same speed and urgency as congress government did in Shah Bano case. Credentials of these type of people and their sympathizers are now well known now thanks to social media. <br/><br/>
On a day when our PM has met kin on great SC Bose in Berlin, I am appalled to see Mr Vardarajan taking up this topic instead of focusing on new doubts that have been raised on his death. It was same Nehru Gandhi dynasty, same media and Leftist historians who never allowed the truth to come out in case of Mr. Bose's death. It is pity on us that people like this author are failing this country time and again. However, now the things are changing as the country is tend to become more literate and knowledgeable - not to be swooped away with comments of such people any more..

                            The so called "S' word should be banned from the lexicon of Indian democracy as it is only used as a tool by half baked intellectuals like Siddarth Varadarajan to bash up Indians who are proud of their heritage and linguistic accomplishments. These scounderals have distorted the meaning of secularism so badly that for the first time in Independent India a Prime Minister had the courage of conviction to question the meaning of the term as it currently understood. It is time that the voice of a minority community (not in the religious sense) to which Siddarth belongs to is drowned by the distilled reason of thousands years of practical secularism practised in India.

                            Ignorant, hypocritical and down-right disgraceful defense of the indefensible. Apparently another "sickularist" ranting about being exposed by the PM Modi for the hypocritical nature of "secularists" in India. The fact that Sanskrit was reinstated into the curriculum after the Congress Government's illegal and improper inclusion of German into the KV curriculum against the national education policy of 2 Indian languages and English - this blowhard wants to criticize the PM's dig at the self-appointed guardians of secularism, while failing completely to realize that it was his own ilk that abrogated the policy on Sanskrit and instead promoted German (where as Germans are learning English!) going against the national policy of offering a third language which was either Sanskrit or a modern Indian language.

                            This an important observation! Modi loves secularism controversies, if there are none he will create one, that's his political strategy! No political party ever questioned whether he gifted Gita to other leaders, it's his choice, and I think it was a beautiful gift idea, but he still tried to create controversy by making a swibe comment on other political parties! Speaking of Congress, they are not as hardliners as the Sangh, but they have traditionally been a very pro-Hindu party and of course nothing wrong in that.

Keeping hatred and spreading dis information against Modi will not work and you people are doing it since 2002. Has it worked once? Instead it might have ruined the health of these haters.

                            Mr. Modi is perfectly right. He is not criticizing Secularism but he is criticizing the "INDIAN VERSION OF SECULARISM" which is far from what is true Secularism &amp; one which Mr. L.K.Adwani calls as "PSEUDO-SECULRISM". <br/>
We are with you Mr. Modi, Keep it up. It is absolutely right to glorify ancient Indian wisdom, knowledge &amp; heritage. If the so called SECULAR feel bad just ignore them.

This debate about secularism is useless and will keep India backward. Congress and its allies have used secularism for years as a tool to get minority votes. The fact is that the worst riots have happened under Congress governments but its only Gujarat riots that the media remembers. Isnt this hypocrisy.<br/><br/>
Also whats its about Priya Pillay, that needs to be mentioned. Modi's statement is to the Indian diaspora, whereas Priya would have been speaking to foriegners. What has this issue got to do with secularism.

1. Lot of people protested in India when Sanskrit was to be introduced in schools.  In the name of secularism we indeed sacrifice our heritage. Even our history is taught in such a way that vedic era and puranic era are pretty much excluded. Achievements of ancient Indian Mathematics as that of Baudayana who referred to Pyathagorus theorem much before the Greeks is not even mentioned. <br/>
2. Also there is a difference in going and testifying to British Parliament against India in a legalistic setting vis-a-vis PM making observation in front of NRIs. This is an inappropriate comparison.

                            I am not able to agree that Modi having a dig abroad at Secularists in India is on all fours with Priya Pillai's anti-India talk on a project in India.Why should Pillai have to go abroad to talk against a project on environmental considerations when she is not prevented talking against the project in India? Furthermore,if Varadarajan's praise of Sanskrit is on the basis of his conviction, what prevented him from talking in support of the introduction of this language even while arguing the point that it need not be introduced in the midst of a session? The answer is that he did not wish to be dubbed as against 'Secularism' as it is fashionable to be called "Secularist" in India. A secularist is praised in this country even if he is otherwise a third rate individual with out character and integrity!<br/>

                            FIRST, everyone should understand that language is always secular, English, Spanish, French  are spoken by people of all religions, language will never be religious even if it is Sanskrit and Sanskrit will never become Hindu even if it is so desired by Mr. Modi. By the way I speak English and I am a Hindu not Christian. Now, some people failed to understand author, I see people doing that everyday, they deny because they want to.<br/>
Modijee does not have option he has to push Hindu agenda otherwise RSS would through him out, look at his status, piddi type bhagwa dharis do not listen to him. <br/>
Another thing, we will see BJP and Modijee would claim their proprietary on all major iconic leaders because they have none in their cadre and history. They started with Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, now Dr. Ambedkar, and Mr. Subhash Chandra Bose is in pipe line to be claimed. I have just heard that Mr. Obama also was having membership with RSS and BJP. And Mr. Modijee and George Washington were friends since 1955.

                            And a well deserved and about time swipe. Secularism at its extreme is dangerous. It is responsible for cleansing the history books to the point where nobody did anything to anybody, pointless. Secularism and its extreme proponents, have ensured that the world sees Hinduism as no more than a mere Myth. Sanskrit has been sidelined to the point of extinction in India. Hindustan is the only country which has lost touch with its past, as the past has been well and truly buried by the over zealous secular army. As a Jewish saying goes, if you do not know your past you cannot chart your future. That is precisely the case with India. At last we have a PM who takes pride in our heritage, ensuring history books are un-doctored and we can be proud of our heritage, irrespective of how we choose to call our God.

                            Senseless criticism. Secularism means the separation of religion from the administration of the state. An individual, even the Prime Minister, is entitled to his personal beliefs. What you have to see is whether his personal beliefs impinge on his administration of the state. Here that is clearly not the case. Every word that Modi utters cannot be tested on the anvil of secularism. And what other members of his administration say or do cannot be charged to Modi's account. Modi has a right to criticise other politicians who use secularism as stick to beat him, and this is a political issue, not administrative. Both offloading Pillai and replacing German were not administrative decisions taken by Modi. And both have nothing to do with secularism. So why link up unrelated issues?

RSS wants to make Congress and Nehru-Gandhi family to be forgotten by Indians. This all the act of fascist ideology in the grab of calling for India development. The matter related to Subash C Bose is also purposely brought during Germany trip, just to malign the image of Pundit Nehru.Disgusting to see PM of India making mockery on main opposition party in foreign land and saying India has changed after I arrived, really shameful. Does Obama ever criticized his opponents Republicans on foreign land? RSS-BJP wants to create communal environment in the country, calling visiting temples and reading Sanskrit is communal.No Indian think like that.All the statements coming from their lower leaders and few allies such as Ghar-wapsi, attacks on Church and voting rights to Muslims etc are part of same communal campaign. Congress should resurrect itself and people of India must realize what game is played to defame India, just to wind election by getting 30% votes, by this government.

                            Foreign funds are helping BJP agenda to talibanise india by spreading hatred towards minorities. These Bakhtis do not understand how the same was achieved in Pakistan by foreign dollar funds where the intolerance towards the minorities has become so high and there is no come back to normal. We must save India from pseudo hindus spreading hatred in India by banning Modi's foreign pleasure trips first.

                            Let me start by saying I respect Sanskrit. As mentioned in the article there is an enormous amount of literature in this language which we can all be proud of. But why did Sanskrit not become widespread in India? I don't think it is because so called "sikular" people or governments tried to kill it or any other such reason. There was a period running into many centuries when people who would like to learn the language were driven away because of caste reasons. Sanskrit was kept so tightly guarded by a few - so was many other things and the vast majority was deprived of all of these. I would say this was the primary reason for Sanskrit shrinking into small pockets. Past is past - what is the situation today? We live in an era where parents talk to their kids in English and not their native toungue. This is becoming more and more prevalent. So I think today we should attempt to save languages like Malayalam, Tamil , Kannada, Gujarati Telungu, Punjabi, Bengali etc etc etc... because the way things are going...the use of these languages would also keep shrinking...I support English education.. but we should learn English as a foreign language and not become English ourselves....Now to Modiji's utterances on secularism.. I think he will spend his 5 year term touring the world and declaring from foreign soil how he treats all sections of Indian people equally and how safe secular ideas are under his regime..but the fact is there for the world to see.

                            Modi ji is a pawn of his own corrupt mind. He has to drag others in the dirt that he himself likes to play in.

                            India, in KV, Germany is moved from third language list to optional foreign languages list and Sanskrit filled that spot (whether Sanskrit is language of museum or useful for indians is not matter here it is as useful or useless to an average indian as german language is especially given the fact that germans are stringent in their immigration policies and non-immigration study/work policies than many western countries).  A hue and cry was made in the name of secularism and german authorities (including Angela Markel) raised "concerns".  So in the way of addressing NRI indian prime minister answered to those concern raising authorities as well. Now coming to ms.pillai's noble idea. Rushing to UK to complaint about an indian project on indian soil that has no concern of the dead empire UK is nothing but image killing in a foreign soil. why should a sovereign nation allow it? It would hold some water if it were in UN which is a bazzar center of world where anyone can raise concern on anyone else in the name of global warming, but to UK is definitely anti-national agenda driven act. Court quashed the stamping on technicalities as the govt. did not give the reason for deporting, which means the govt. is not so keen on not allowing her travel abroad but to just send a warning or perhaps merely wanted to delay her travel. If a PM can talk bad about its opposition party BJP in the name of secularism in foreign soil a PM can talk about the reverse.

                            Have you ever written something good about Modi and BJP? In the last 3 days, he has done lot of good things, why don't you write about that? If you are a neutral journalist, then you have to congratulate if someone does good and criticize if something is wrong? Have you written an article about Rahul Gandhi's absence for the last two months?

                            Well written. During Congress rule, Sanskrit was always held in high esteem by Indians. Modi trying to project some sort of discrimination against Sanskrit is absurd as it his linking it to secularism when there is no connection. That a small percentage of average students may want to study Sanskrit is a fact we have to live with, and choice of languages is to be provided.

                            It will be nice if the writer can define the secularism first. If the writer things that joining hands with MIM and IUML is secularism but supporting cause of Hindus is communalism let it be so.

WHY CAN'T RSS /VHP and AIPML / CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY have a dialogue between them  to work out a common understanding solutions.  When issues are within this communities, why blance BJP govt all the time.<br/>

                            Surprised to see the very values as India which has been settled for decades and culturally accepted is now being challenged. Wondering if we are trying to trace back to our roots? I doubt this is a time. Adding more fuel to it is the stirring of different groups getting ahead with revitalizing hindutva. <br/>
I wonder how deep everyone practising hindutva is aware about its roots to Vedanta and its principles. One must understand and internalize before getting religious all over. <br/>
There are 2 things that have existed in the world. The good and the evil. <br/>
Good gives peace. Evil gives uneasiness. We must understand that secularism in India is not an article of debate but a practise.<br/><br/>
I wonder if anyone out there is really practising or frantically following a leadership team which is probably polarising

I challenge this guy to declare a day by when all its BJP MLAs and MPs could fluently speak Sanskrit with someone I'd chose.

                            Dear Mr. Varadarajan, please don't preach us about india's secularism..Modi made remarks while addressing Indians abroad..he wanted to update them about the sicularists outcry in India....nothing to do with what the greenpeace employee did...it is a foreign funded organization, using the funds to influence parties and helping people to organize protests etc..and she was going to present the case against a project inside india to  British law makers, even though the Indian co. executing it was registered in U.K ....should we ever accept interference of india's internal issues by  outsiders, especially our former colonial masters ?  We have had enough lecture of secularist values....just stop it and do something else..

                            Mr Varadarajan, you suit and tie says it all.  I live in England and inquired into why a tie is worn.  It was to keep out the cold because <br/>
it is very cold in England and Europe and some parts of the world.  Indians do not need suit and tie.  But they wear it to show that they are anglicised.  The British did a good job of educating Indians to feel guilty about their own culture to make them into slaves and rule them.  Our whole education system after the British is to produce workers who will work hard under leaders who will be white men.  Before the British Indian universities were visited by Japanese, Chinese,European scholars to study because it was based on Vedic system.<br/>
You are a product of the British system and your suit and tie in India where it is not needed at all shows how you have been brainwashed by the western system of producing slaves in India.  You are one of the slaves who is still questioning the use of Sanskrit language because you feel ashamed of it.  It is the mother of all languages and I know how much it is revered by the scholars in the west but find Indians ashamed about it because of their westernised education system in India.<br/>
You are also mixing the case of a Greenpeace worker with Modi. This has no relevance.  Modi is saying that India should be represented by Indians and its Indianness should be promoted because that is what we represent.  Under the name of secularism the western countries also promote their own religions and dogmas.  In Britain the church is given all support and is the richest landholder.  Secularism is a label to keep people happy but racism and divide and rule are practised very methodically.  So they only pay lip service to secularism. Similarly all over the world.  Islamic countries care a hoot about secularism and yet the west bends itself backward to do business with them without blacklisting them because of oil.  Islam is the fastest growing religion and you will soon have Isis marching people like you to the shooting grounds if not for people like Modi who are ready to stand the ground to promote Indianness in the world along with its culture and heritage and languages and way of life. Please respect the heat of India and remove your suit and tie and wear Indian cotton and then you will understand.

                            The writer out of ignorance compares some eggs &amp; apples just to prove a point. Priya Pillai went on foreign funds, spoke to foreign audience/law makers against a project in India. Modi on the other hand spoke to Indian audience both in Japan &amp; in Germany. If such senior writers can see both the things as equal then God bless us all. No wonder prime time will have prgrammes like 'Shame on Team India' or 'Shame Gen VK Singh'. Shameless discussions having no meaning at all except pleasing egos of some.
