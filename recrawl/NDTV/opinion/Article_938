Headline::::Where Hardik Patel Could Have Made a Real Impact



DateTime::::2015-11-28T04:50:00+05:30




                                On Constitution Day, Home Minister Rajnath Singh made a revelation in parliament - that it was Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar's fight for justice and equality that inspired Narendra Modi to flag off some of the BJP government's more ambitious schemes like the Swacch Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission), Jan Dhan Yojana (Banking For All Scheme) and the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Andolan (Educate the Girl Child Campaign).
 
The Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Andolan programme was launched by the Prime Minister at the beginning of the year, reflecting his concern for the disappearing girl child in Indian society.
 
Although during his nearly 15-year-long rule in Gujarat, the state's sex ratio did not improve, if anything, it dropped by 1 from 920 females for every 1000 males in the 2001 census to 919 in the 2011 census. In contrast, at the national level, the ratio improved from 933 to 940 for the same period. And worse, in the 0-6 age group, there are just 886 girls in Gujarat, per 1000 boys.
 
Ironically, female feoticide and infanticide are rampant in the economically prosperous areas of urban and rural Gujarat - Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Kutch, Rajkot and Jamnagar districts - which attracted more than 70% of the investments made in Gujarat during the past decade. The lowest sex ratio was registered in Surat, the wealthy diamond and textile hub, which has only 836 girls to 1000 boys, followed by Mehsana at 845 and 847 in Gandhinagar, the state's capital.
 
Most of these districts have a high population of Patedars or Patels. And it is this politically and financially powerful community, longtime cheerleaders of Hindutva and the poster boys of the BJP for nearly three decades, who are the worst offenders. Today in Gujarat, 6.29 lakh men above the age of 30 and 40 are unmarried, many of them Patels. These figures exclude youth in their 20s who are struggling to find wives.
 
The extent of the problem and the way in which it is quietly ruining thousands of young lives was exposed earlier this year when the Patedar community began an agitation to abolish caste-based reservations in educational institutions and government jobs or be included in the state OBC (Other Backward Castes) list to become eligible for the same benefits.
 
A large number of supporters of the Hardik Patel-led Patedar Anamat Andolan Samiti, like Pradeep, are single. The 32-year-old graduate from the Patel-dominated village of Rupal on the outskirts of Ahmedabad runs a TV repair shop. He is convinced, that if he had a government job, finding a partner would be easy. Rupal is home to nearly 40 unmarried men and has a shockingly skewed sex ratio of 75 girls to 100 boys. But this is a reality that Pradeep and community leaders don't want to face.
 
Similarly, 28-year-old Bhavesh Patel from Patan in North Gujarat, while accepting there is a shortage of women, believes that as long as he continues to earn a living as a marginal farmer, he will never be seen as good husband material because there is no future or money in land. Bhavesh is a commerce graduate.
 
Gujarat has the lowest unemployment rate in the country at 1.2 per cent (against the national average of 4.9 per cent), but the state's business model did not create enough white collar jobs to accommodate the aspirations of men like Pradeep and Bhavesh. Presently, their only hope of being employed is in the informal sector, where salaries are low and hiring is largely done on a contractual basis. In this bleak landscape, government jobs offer both financial security and dignity of labour, which is what the increasingly educated young women here want. Remember that Patels for decades made their living either through agriculture, or via small family-owned businesses - both sectors have seen a downturn as the Gujarat model of development focuses on landing investment for big business.
Today, the Patels are running a no-holds-barred campaign against the BJP in the local body elections for failing to address their demand for reservation, which Pradeep and Bhavesh believe will solve their problems. The ruling party, on the other hand, is pulling out all stops to defeat them, playing the caste card by aggressively wooing the OBC voters in the state who are refusing to share a slice of their quota pie with the Patels.  
If only the likes of Hardik Patel had led a mass movement to end the murder of the unborn girl child, political parties would have been forced to follow his lead, and address the frustration and lack of self-worth that appears to have infected a large portion of Gujarati youth.
 
That's why, in these polls, results of which are due on December 2, there will be no winners, only losers.(Shikha Trivedy is Features Editor, NDTV 24x7)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Since the author highlighted some figures from Census, I throw thought I would share some more. Sex Ratio in Andhra Pradesh - 961 in 2001 vs 939 in 2011 (Ruled by Congress), Maharashtra - 913 in 2001 vs 894 in 2011 (Congress). I can go on and on but the author selectively decides to quotes statistics, the entire exercise becomes flawed. As far as Hardik Patel is concerned, we all know that he is nothing more than an opportunist and a sheer hypocrite who has done nothing worthwhile in his life.

                            Interesting analysis. India's skewed gender ratio will affect the politics in other states in the future too. Lots of angry frustrated young men, not able to get partners, roaming the streets will not end well for us. But how it will affect the politics is unknown.

                            Reservation for Patels is not possible legally,  Patels must understand this. Even if government agrees,  court will turn it down, like for Marathas for example.

                            You are missing few very valid points. Do you really know how much patidar community cares for study? If you go further, you will have more female patidars with good education than male. Do you know that last year there were some 9000 places open for the post of constable and the amount of patidar applied was less than 0.5%. Govt jobs are not only solution to their troubles. It's mentality which needs to be changed. It you want money, you need to put effort too. Hardik Patel himself is a commerce graduate with just 49%. Will anybody care to offer him placement? He is out there asking for reservation but has he taken pain to learn any vocational course? No, on the name of caste Congress is dividing people of Gujarat and patidars are becoming toys in their hand. I am not an avid BJP supporter but yes, we can see what is going on. Has anyone guts to ask patidars to pay for the loss of govt property which they caused. They never pay any taxes as being farmers they enjoy almost everything free, but it's our money which is ued to build those properties.

                            When will you talk about sex ratio in states like Pondichery? i.e. 1037 females for 1000 males. Are parents killing the male foetus? or this seems normal? Then why the other way around is always blamed on foeticide/infanticide?

                            I do not agree. Every leader must have followers. And the followers will only follow leaders who promise what they aspire for. When Gujaratis aspire for male children, somebody opposing that, even with good intentions, is hardly likely to create a stir. Plus what is Hardik's personal interest in this issue which cuts across caste and religion? He is interested only in reservation for Patels.

                            How apparent is it now that ndtv is running a major campaign again PM Modi,  is evident through such articles. Did it first reveal statistics about percentage population that has been brought above poverty line in the last decade compared to national average or other states? No. The writer conveniently ignores that the reason aspirations of such youth aren't met, is because the free entrepreneur environment of Gujarat and the culture of meritocracy has actually helped many youth emerge out of poverty,  have built their successful Enterprises and ate self reliant,  not demanding reservations or subsidies and not dependent on government help.

                            It seems she does not want to understand that with investment comes flurry of migrants as skilled or unskilled labours and this is mainly in form of man. For example at Surat, which has lowest Sex Ratio, no of migrant labours will be in the vicinity of 7-8 lacs, out of which hardly 1 to 1.5 lacs will be women. Similar is the case for Ahmadabad due to Sanand, Jamnagar due to Reliance &amp; Essar Petro plants and industrialized  districts of Vadodar, Rajkot.

                            More than this, he should have rode on Gujarat's ever increasing inter-caste marriage trend.<br/>
He should have asked for reservation for children of inter-caste marriage.<br/>
In 40 years, Gujarat could have been the first caste-free state.<br/>
Female foeticide prevention could be a side effect.
