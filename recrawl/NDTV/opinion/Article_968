Headline::::PM Modi Must Come Clean On RSS' Akhand Bharat Agenda



DateTime::::2015-12-30T03:46:00+05:30




                                Let me confess that my first reaction to the Narendra Modi photo-op showing him hand-in-hand with Nawaz Sharif was of shock and disbelief. For this is the same Prime Minister who, in a famous pre-election interview to Rajat Sharma, said, "A neighbour hits you and in response you go to America! Why don't you go to Pakistan instead? Pakistan ko usi ki bhasha mein jawab dena chahiye. Yeh love-letter likhna band karna chahiye (Pakistan needs to be answered in the same language it speaks, stop writing love letters)."
So, PM Modi and Sharif holding hands at the airport and exchanging gifts on the Pakistani premier's birthday has baffled many, including some of his own followers and party leaders. Many of those who have been speaking for amity between India and Pakistan and have been termed bleeding hearts mostly by Sangh affiliates are lauding the magnanimity on the part of PM Modi.
The bonding on the surprise visit by PM Modi to Lahore was a matter of relief after the exchange of barbs and fire across the border.
In the past, the BJP had ripped apart Manmohan Singh on his Pakistan policy with Sushma Swaraj famously suggesting in 2013 that if Pakistan did not return the severed head of the martyred soldier Hemraj, India should "get at least 10 heads from the other side". It is the same party whose ideological fountainhead, the RSS, came down heavily on LK Advani in 2005 when, as party president, he distanced himself from the concept of "Akhand Bharat" (Undivided India which includes Bangladesh and Pakistan) and called the partition an "unalterable reality of history" but saluted the chief architect of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, on Pakistani soil. Standing before Jinnah's tomb, Advani had described the founder of Pakistan as "secular" and an "ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity". Within days, he was forced to step down as the President of BJP.
In 2015, the wheels of Indo-Pak relations seem to have come full circle. PM Modi and his party's foreign policy on Pakistan have been riddled with contradiction. Modi's confidante and National Security Advisor AK Doval, who single-handedly strategises the PM's diplomatic overtures, has not been able to display a coherent or well thought out Pakistan policy, with most of our actions depending on political convenience. Modi's foreign policy so far has fluctuated between catering to national sentiments when needed to win votes with a good dose of hostile statements and warm gestures when he wants to be seen like a statesman. Many foreign policy experts have suggested that our policy on Pakistan has been driven by short-term political interests veering uncomfortably from one extreme to the other.
Modi extended a hand of friendship to Nawaz Sharif, significantly on a day which saw the birth anniversary of Jinnah and the birthday of ex-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, suggesting he is keen to usher in a new era in Indo-Pak relations.
 
But just then, as if on cue, BJP leader and ex-RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav, in an interview with Mehdi Hasan of Al Jazeera, told the world this: "The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) still believes that one day these parts, which have for historical reasons separated only 60 years ago, will again, through popular goodwill, come together and Akhand Bharat will be created." Ram Madhav, who after ten years as RSS spokesperson joined the BJP last year, is unofficially the international face of the RSS and the BJP. He is also known for his proximity to Doval. In a scenario like this, one would want to ask if it was possible that Madhav was unaware of Modi's Pakistan visit and what was to ensue further.
 
Did Ram Madhav play the Akhand Bharat card to placate the RSS and the hardliners while helping the PM inch closer to the image of a great statesman? If PM Modi's Pakistan policy has the blessings of the RSS, then where does it leave the concept of "Akhand Bharat" declared on April 12, 1964, by former Jan Sangh president Deendayal Upadhyaya and socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia and reiterated by RSS leaders on various occasions, including Ram Madhav in his recent interview?
In September this year, Dattatreya Hosabale, the General Secretary of the RSS, told the media, "India is part of SAARC and has family-like cultural relations with neighbouring countries, whether it is Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan or Bangladesh. It was one body which was divided to form Pakistan and Bangladesh. It is natural that people living there are part of the same family... Sometimes relations (go bad), like it happens between brothers, and so we also discussed how we can improve our relations with those who are historically and geographically attached to us."
With this as background, does Ram Madhav's statement suggest that PM Modi is treading on friendly ground only to further the Sangh's Akhand Bharat agenda? If not, it is time that our Prime Minister speaks his mind; else it will again be a case of one step forward and two steps backward in Indo-Pak relations.

                            Can you get out of the mindset that for everything happening in this country, PM needs to give a response?. India is a developing economy and he requires lot more of things to do that you and me.  So lets have some common sense before we drag PM into every silly nonsensical issue.

Where is tolerance level now that even beautiful thought of seeing old India as one again is expressed. Don't want to waste time reading article so jumped to comment section directly.

                            I think Rana you are looking from the wrong lense. The historic comments related to akhand bharat like one in 1964 could be rhetoric with expansionist mindset. But in todays context akhand bharat concept exists in terms of unionization of countries in the region. The SAARC is made up of akhand bharat ideology, but its not a functional organization like European union or ASEAN . Around the world , countries who have common culture and economic agenda, do form such organizations and act as a single identity. As per UN charters their physical borders will always exists, but their political alignment is possible and which is what Akhand bharat concept is. Again stop looking thia from an expansionist mindset. In US, the south asian community does live in the same manner. Thats the best place where you can see Akhand Bharat exists beyond borders. For Modi he has strengthened border and has significantly improved national security along borders and through diplomatic means he has got pakistan to the table to talk and deal with terrorism on world stage. I dont see how this two pronged approach is wrong. Diplomacy changes with situation and time, but its the intent that should be measured on not tactical moves.

                            This article proves that this 'award-winning' journalist still doesn't get it. Modi has in one clean stroke left his detractors again scratching their heads and confused them to the core. They are still trying to figure him out but Modi is way smarter, he has left them far behind. The reactions from Rana Ayyub to the Congress just prove how confused they are.

Ram Madhav clearly said that his interview was recorded on 7th but published later.So, both events are not interconnected.Why PM Modi did what he did is surely surprising and it can prove to be good or bad, we don't know.I do believe that it was not spontaneous and was planned earlier.Am also sure both PMs didn't discuss Ladoos and Jalebis. Surely there is something crucial getting discussed that they don't want to share with cheap and crazy media.<br/><br/>
PM doesn't have to clarify everything RSS says. RSS has their own ideology, some like it, some don't. As PM of country he has a different role and responsibility and he is doing well there. <br/><br/>
Aap ye sab bhool jao, aap SRK ya Arvind Kejriwal par focus karo. That will get you more entertaining stories and likes.

                            Its also worth hearing that interview with Mehdi Hassan. The question on Akhand Bharat was specifically raised by Mehdi Hassam. Ram Madhav was, in fact, replying to his question that sought clarification on the question of Akhand Bharat. I seriously doubt Ram Madhav's reference to Akhand Bharat was not at all pre-meditated

Akhand bharat is a historical reality unless we have read different history. I agree mr Madhav could be more cautious but he has apologised for his remarks. Let PM of India worry about more pressing issues than heeding to your advise.

Nothing can come good out of religion as its very purpose is being negated. I say destroy all religions from the sub-continent and unify these countries. Let the people live with peace and harmony. Many people in Pakistan want to see the countries united. It is these fringe elements who are preventing it. I want to wake up to a morning when all the symbols of religion are destroyed from the ground.

                            He is clean. But the problem is with you. You and people like you think RSS is extremist organization like they see in Pakistan, middle east, europe, ...etc. if so she has to provide proof of its extremist actions like weapons training, physical attack on others, ...etc. Anything you want to talk against RSS or any other organizations then first prove it otherwise you may face defamation. So BJP, Modi &amp; RSS need not come clean on anything. Rana Ayuub needs to come with proof which is admissible in the court of law against RSS or any organization or individual before making a scathing remark or allegation.

                            Akhand Bharat is a cultural concept and should not be read in military terms. Rana Ayyub has so much intolerance in her for PM Modi and BJP that she cannot by objective while analyzing events. PM Modi should be applauded for reaching out to Pakistan in a bid to improve relations. This is far better then the Sharm Al Shaik episode where UPA gave away a lot with nothing in return. Congress has been like that. In 1971 Indian army won a magnificent military victory against Pakistan, only to lose it in negotiations with the Shimla agreement.India had better relations with Pakistan whenever NDA was in power. Congress has not accepted partition fully and hence cannot engage with Pakistan in a sane and normal way.

OMG, you took so much space and time to about much ado about nothing! You must be a very savvy "journo"! Would any country in the right might want to accept a bunch of losers - your countries of concern that is?

                            If you have to ask PM Modi to reply and clarify stand on everything ... why do you (journalists) call others from BJP/RSS etc. as speakers on your program? Send questions to the PM and request him for interviews. That too when you know that from India's perspective this is a non-issue. I don't see Pakistan and Bangladesh crying on this. <br/><br/>
Also, if someone has such a dream, why is that an issue? I feel no one should get offended. They are not talking about splitting a country but uniting countries which were ONE just few decades back. <br/><br/>
And then you say - "does Ram Madhav's statement suggest that PM Modi is treading on friendly ground only to further the Sangh's Akhand Bharat agenda?" - Seriously!!?? <br/><br/>
An earlier para mentions - "In a scenario like this, one would want to ask if it was possible that Madhav was unaware of Modi's Pakistan visit and what was to ensue further." Are you suggesting that almost every one in BJP and Govt knew that Pak visit was planned, except may be best news agencies in India?? Note that this was recorded on 7th Dec - 2 weeks before the visit.

RSS is propagating this from its formation days since 1925.The BJP was found in 1970's.For gods sake how on the earth you ask such things which is irrelevant to a head of government and Prime Minister. These are two different organizations. One is ( the RSS )Socio Cultural organisation &amp; the other (the BJP )is a Political organization.Kindly restrain yourself from these.<br/><br/>

What is wrong in Unification? Are you against Peace in the region? Are you in favor of continuing hostilities in the region? Are you in favor of division of the Great Civiliation on the basis of religion? Are you in favor of spending billions of dollars on arms which will eventually destroy the Brothers who broke apart for some reasons? Did you ever asked a mother whose sons divide the property whether she lives with the hope of family unification one day? Did you bother to answer yourself as to Economics of Size this United Family will create- alongwith the opportunities for growth? Yes, we will fight with each on religious basis as Brothers have adopted different religious belief but does that make us sworn enemies?<br/><br/>
Please ANSWER any of these questions and then you do not have to ask Modi/RSS or anyone for answers.

Agree, that now it's broken into many countries but the idea can still be achieved through trade and culture. Just like EU(European Union ) we can also have seamless access to South Asia or Akhand Bharat. I would say it's an optimistic view, free of tensions and worries.

                            Modi the god is beyond questioning according to bhaktos. Anyone questioning him will have to face filthy abuses by the specially trained trolls. But there are millions of sensible people reading and trying to anyalyze without any bias. Si Rana and the likes should continue to write and bare the deeds/misdeeds which affect the nation. we cant reason out with you bhaktos so you continue to nacho

                            BJP is basically jhoomla party. Since last 19 months they have been coining one or another idea with zero support on implementation or from common man.<br/>
They can't accept hindus becoming less than 80%, God knows how can they advocate for becoming less than two third.
