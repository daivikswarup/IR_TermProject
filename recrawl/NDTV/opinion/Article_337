Headline::::Modi-Ji, This Broken Promise is An Act of Dishonour



DateTime::::2014-12-31T19:36:00+05:30



(Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 14 books, including, most recently, Pax Indica: India and the World of the 21st Century.)New Year's Resolutions, it is said, are made to be broken. There's something about a new dawn that inspires the earnestness of yearned-for virtue in most of us, and we solemnly pledge to do this and that in the course of the New Year which we never thought ourselves capable of fulfilling in the old. And then, as the New Year turns less new, we tend to regret those rash resolutions, modify them, ignore them, or most of all, simply forget them.Our new government didn't wait for the New Year to make something of a habit of breaking its promises, as a celebrated Congress Party publication on the BJP's many U-turns pointed out in early December. To some degree, this is unsurprising in most democracies: after all, as New York Governor Mario Cuomo famously pointed out more than two decades ago, "you campaign in poetry, but you govern in prose". Extravagant campaign promises tend to look much more difficult to fulfil when faced with the reality of government.But still, it is something new to discover a government breaking a promise that it has repeatedly made not just in its campaign but on the floor of Parliament, expressed by the Finance Minister in his Budget speech and repeated by the Prime Minister himself. A failure to fulfil such promises is normally, in most parliamentary democracies, a resigning matter, but our government carries on, blithely unconcerned. Meanwhile, of this particular promise, there is no sign of any intention to actually fulfil it.What am I going on about? Very simple: it is the pledge to ensure "One Rank One Pension" for our retired military personnel, who currently suffer gross injustice through the provision of pensions that have not been indexed to inflation, so that a Brigadier who retired twenty years ago gets a lower pension than a Captain who leaves the force this year. This entirely reasonable demand - made by people who have risked their lives to protect our borders, our nation, and us - was acceded to by the UPA government, echoed by the NDA, and announced again by the new regime after its ascension to power. Barely two months ago, Prime Minister Modi declared emotionally on his visit to the troops in Siachen that "One Rank One Pension has been fulfilled".But Modi-ji, it has not been fulfilled. Not one soldier has received an enhanced pension; meanwhile leaks in the newspapers "reveal" that the Finance Ministry has had a change of heart, saying that justice to our men in uniform would "cost too much". It seems the Comptroller of Defence Accounts has estimated that the cost of One Rank One Pension could be as high as 9,300 crore. It may sound a lot, but the estimated budget for Mr Modi's much-vaunted statue of Sardar Patel is 1,500 crore, which puts this sum in perspective.At a recent media conclave, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar hedged his bets, suggesting that ex-servicemen would get 80% of the promised pension, and adding that "100% satisfaction to everyone is never given in real life."  This is an utter travesty. Is Mr Modi prepared to stand before the nation and say that we should not believe anything he promises, but that he will try to deliver 80% of it? If the Kargil war had happened on his watch, would we have to be content with getting 80% of the heights back?Our soldiers never make 80% effort; they give 100%, indeed more. The nation owes them at least this much.It is true I have a soft corner for our armed forces. I believe they embody the best of what India can be, but so rarely is: they are motivated, professional, meritocratic, competent, reliable, free of caste and religious prejudice, and they take risks the rest of us would not dare to. Yet we treat them in a disgracefully cavalier fashion. During my UN peace-keeping years, when I dealt with a large number of senior military officers and issues from around the world, I was appalled to see how poorly our professional officers were valued by our self-regarding bureaucracy. Whereas our officers, man to man, outshone their counterparts from Western militaries in their competence, intelligence and humanity, our system subjected them to various petty indignities. A full Colonel with over 25 years of service behind him is ranked by our babus below a Director in protocol terms. I have suffered through peacekeeping seminars in which a knowledgeable Indian military officer had to defer to a callow bureaucrat in discussions on military matters. At a time when post-Cold War peacekeeping called for serious levels of military expertise at the UN Headquarters in New York, India remained the only Permanent Mission to the UN (of any major peace-keeping contributor) not to post a military adviser. Our diplomats believed they knew it all themselves.This attitude extends to conditions of service across the board. A Joint Secretary, with nineteen years of professional experience, is deemed the equivalent of a Major-General, who not only has thirty years but has commanded men and materiel, made life-and-death decisions and protected our nation. We pay pensions to a lot more Joint Secretaries than Major-Generals (only 0.8% of army officers ever attain Major General rank). Yet we are now quibbling about the cost.Who are the people we are cheating here by pinching pennies? Some 20 lakh ex-servicemen and four lakh widows. It is time to ask the Government of Messrs Modi and Jaitley: gentlemen, have you no shame?It is ironic that the BJP, which prides itself on a robust attitude to defence, should betray its own promises to the men who actually defend our country. Building a War Memorial is symbolism, which the Modi government seems much better at than substance. Actually making a difference in the lives of our retired service personnel is the kind of tangible benefit this government shrinks from too often.As far back as 2003, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence recommended One Rank One Pension, calling it "a debt" the nation had to pay. It is a debt our Government must honour. Not to do so is an act of dishonor. It dishonours the nation and the flag these men have fought to defend. And it thoroughly discredits those who would treat the well-being of our jawans and officers as one more election promise to be lightly cast aside.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            It would have been wonderful if Mr Shashi tharoor had written this article when UPA was in power. The injustice he is highlighting today is gross and had been happening since last three decades to our hapless veterans who are treated as captive audience because of the oath he has taken while all those who had been doing this gross injustice are not tied to that kind of chaste cord. When women and soldiers of a nation do not get the dignity they deserve, no leadership can take the nation forward towards decency. Anyway even if he has raked up this issue belatedly, i respect him for this and request the present Govt specially the honourable PM who had been advocating and promising OROP for last year and a half to honour that commitment without delay to protect the dignity of this patriot clan. Let not any one come in the way of this implementation because our brave soldiers of yesterday deserve it hands down because they sacrificed themselves for India and never let this nation down. No arithmetic should dilute it and no accountant should be allowed to sabotage it at any cost because it is legitimate and well deserved from every angle. Hope the implementation orders get issued ASAP as per the DGL forwarded to MOD by service headquarters. I salute the great sons of the soil ...our dear soldiers.

                            A soldier and God are only remembered during bad times and quickly forgotten when deliverance is done but the fact is that no one can rule out the divinity and nobility of both. One is omnipotent while other is ever awake. Let the mortals dare forget and ignore both. Nothing else to say. Politics should never be mixed with reality and reality is that our soldiers need to be looked after with great sense of dignity and humility by one and all citizens of this nation else we will be doing a biggest disservice to self. I have faith in our PM and he will deliver for sure.

                            May I know when was the last time a CON-gress PM visited Siachen met our troops?<br/><br/>
Mr.Tharoor, as people of India we got cheated by CON-gress for 10 years with scams named for A to Z and you took the economy back to 1980's. <br/><br/>
Due to that we gave BJP a chance to prove. I request you wait for 5 years and if BJP dont do well, CON-gress is always there to sit on our heads.<br/><br/>
Meanwhile, as you have 5 years to spend, please work with CBI and get your Wife murderer to prison.

                            For 60 plus years congress FOOLED the armed forces and Sashi wants BJP to correct it in 6 months. What a shame. For 60 years congress happily made Indian a weak nation in defence and cheated the armed forcees and Shashi now comments on BJP. Shashi cannot even hold is family together and is commenting on BJP not doing justice to armed forces. Did you do justice to your wife. no isnt it. For 60 years did not congress cheat the armed forces without giving one rank and one pension. for 60 years congress fooled the armed forcees and now this man Shashi wants to do it in 6 months by BJP.

                            Dear Mr Tharoor, your comments are logical so also the relevance of the context, emotions, for our defense personnel. But is it not shame full on the part of opposition parties that they did not cooperate with Government in Rajya Sabha in clearing the bills for the 125 crores Indian's welfare. Your party did not even care to discuss the issues of public relevance. Even if you all ( opposition ) have issues related to religious conversions, with which many-many Indians would be with you all but is it not criminal to make  Rajya Sabha hostage of your political whims

                            One small quibble Mr. Tharoor. As you rightly pointed out, one rank one pension (OROP) was recommended by a Parliamentary committee with jurisdiction on this matter. Your party was in power for two full terms since then and you were part of the cabinet. So my question is what the hell you guys were doing?<br/><br/>
Mind you I am not a fan of Modi but there is an old saying "throwing stone while residing in glass house" etc.

                            Now every one is climbing the band wagon &amp; giving their two bits about OROP &amp; we have never heard most of them talk about any thing connected with defence earlier. What did the UPA do during their 10 years in power? Except for Rajeev Chandrashekhar i dont think we can consider any politician  to be serious about defence issues.<br/><br/>
It would be interesting to know what Chidambaram thought when he allotted a measly 500 crores. Till now he has not opened his mouth &amp; neither Manmohan Singh<br/>
I am sure next we will have Dawood Ibrahim talking about it since the Indian ESM is no one's baby &amp; any one can  pass comments on it.

                            Awww!  It is very touching! One Rank One Pension has been requested for almost the past 10 years. I was just wondering why the Congress party and  Mr Shashi Tharoor took 10 years to write an article supporting our Armed Forces, and what they did about this. Now withing 6 months, they want Modi government to deliver, what they couldn't deliver in 10 years, and that too after leaving a broken treasury for Modi to deal with.<br/><br/>
Our Armed Forces deserve the best and I am sure Modi government knows how to keep their promises. They need to be given reasonable time for that to figure out how to do it.

                            😊<br/>
Soon after getting freedom from British rule in 1947, the de-facto prime minister of India, Jawahar Lal Nehru called a meeting of senior Army Officers to select the first General of the Indian army.<br/>
Nehru proposed, "I think we should appoint a British officer as a General of The Indian Army, as we don't have enough experience to lead the same." Having learned under the British, only to serve and rarely to lead, all the civilians and men in uniform present nodded their heads in agreement.<br/>
However one senior officer, Nathu Singh Rathore, asked for permission to speak.Nehru was a bit taken aback by the independent streak of the officer,though, he asked him to speak freely.<br/>
Rathore said ,"You see, sir, we don't have enough experience to lead a nation too,so shouldn't we appoint a British person as the first Prime Minister of India?"<br/>
You could hear a pin drop.<br/>
After a pregnant pause, Nehru asked Rathore, "Are you ready to be the first General of The Indian Army ?"Rathore declined the offer saying "Sir, we have a very talented army officer, my senior, Lt. Gen. Cariappa, who is the most deserving among us."<br/>
This is how the brilliant Gen. Cariappa became the first General and Rathore the first ever Lt. General of the Indian Army.<br/>

He complaining about Sardar Patel Statue, when tourists flow to see this Statue and when state government earning huge revenue, you and other congress leaders will say it's not because of statue but he was a congress leader.

                            Dear Mr Tharoor, Kindly refrain from making any political comments pertaining to our defence forces and personnel, who are known to be one of the most apolitical forces in the world - not because they are paid very highly but because of traditions, bravery, family traits and above all their love for motherland (unlike many many politicians and civilians). Can you ask anybody to give his life just for some chips? Yes, this is another matter that we MUST look after them after they have retired after serving their cause for the nation - after all there is remaining life! Why blame a nascent government headed by Modi at the Centre? Were there no "responsible" governments before this one? It's easy to blame others. Why did not other governments and prime ministers implemented this plan which is being pursued by our armed forces for decades? This is just one what about "Garibi Hatao", "Mera Bharat Mahan" and so on when most of the rulers were rued in utter corruption? Please have a heart! Support good decisions and let them be implemented and do not do criticism just for doing as an opposition!!!

                            The corrupt babus must have convinced the government that one rank one pension is not feasible. They are fed on the corruption philosophy for the past so many years. It is time for the govt. to shake of the shackles of the well fed bureaucrats. Maybe the govt should ask babus to take a paycut so that they can get the budgeted amount for the army.

                            Developing Sardar Patel statue would be part of large eco system of tourism; There may be political wish behind this &amp; but economically, Rs1500 crores spent on statue would yield dividend on multiple sectors of tourism industry. My simple question to Tharoor is, what did UPA do for the past 10 years with respect to 1 rank - 1 pension? I have answer for that &amp; UPA was busy in making scams &amp; then covering scams from the attack.

                            I am not a fan/follower of Mr Shashi Tharoor but why target him for a valid issue raised by him. Better to comment on his article. Targeting him is like shooting the messenger. <br/><br/>
What he has said is true. Let Modi government deliver what they have promised. There is nothing wrong in reminding PM of his duties towards the soldiers unless Modi govt wants to follow in the footsteps of Congress (which no doubt had the worst approach towards soldiers not only on OROP but on almost all issues concerning them be it court cases against disabled soldiers, cheating them of the dues granted by pay commissions, humiliating them as a group etc). Why do you think soldiers came out in favour of Modi/BJP so strongly?

                            For a true Patriotic Soldier, the faultless fighting equipments he/she is provided by the Government is far more important than monetary benefits. The previous UPA Government, having the opportunity of ruling for entire 10 years has utterly failed in this. They cannot blame the coalition Partner for this as there own "Mr. Clean" was at the helm for 7 long years, in the process being the longest serving Defence Minister(albeit "Mr. Clean" entered via the Rajya Sabha route not Lok Sabha as he has never contested in a Single Lok Sabha election in his entire political career spanning 50+ years).As per the recent Parliamentary Report on Defence  there is critical shortage in practically every area of defence, Fighter Aircrafts, Helicopters, Ships, Submarines, Battle Tanks, Shoes, Guns etc..etc. The list goes on and on. Why was the previous UPA Defence Minister so lethargic and sleeping over the files without clearing them? We would have not be in such a bad situation had he acted swiftly, boldly and with a clear conscience. Sri Shashi Tharoorji  should first introspect the damage done on defence preparedness by the previous UPA Defence Minister before trying to blame this Govt., which has been in office for the last half a year only.

                            Dear Mr Tharoor<br/>
Well written article. But I would say it is a deliberate omission on your part that you have chosen not to talk about the other side of the coin too, not that you do not know about it. I have read articles written by people from armed forces about this. Here goes, while one rank, one pension has a credible arguement in that a brigadier retired 20 years ago, gets a lower pension than a captain recently retired, no doubt, but it also prevents a recently promoted brigadier from receiving the same or more pension than a much senior brigadier. Not just a brigadier, but any rank in the army. Simply because pay scales do get better each year for new candidates and this means an army man needs to spend fewer years to reach a specific pension than earlier. One pension, One rank will only deepen this divide further. The army has to worry about the morale of the soldiers who are serving currently, than those who are not in active service. We cannot have the apple and eat it too.

However I do not grudge you as much as I do Hon Capt Amarinder Singh being an ex Officer and Gentleman, belonging to the Famed Patiala House . He has the audacity to write what you have when he could have done so much when in Power. He makes a statement" do the politicians rule or the bureaucrats" . Capt Sahib please do not joke with us Veterans. The whole world knows that the bureaucrats rule this country and not you politicians. Please do not forget the statement of a senior bureaucrat "OROP over my dead body". That is what your standing is as a politician. I am sure you must be insisting on issue of voucher for every critic you do on an individual for brownie points. Keep them carefully least the termites do not eat them.

                            Mr. Tharoor, very well said for bringing the issue into limelight. But you going by the media gossip and taking leads from leaked info through your contacts, your assumption of BJP not fulfilling their election promises is not the right approach. Instead of resorting to writing columns, why couldn't you discuss with the PM and contribute for the betterment? You are one of those very few from Congress who has direct access to him. Shashi it is time for introspection too, what the current government has done in 6 months, you guys in Congress couldn't do it in 60 x 2 months. India is a very complex country and to satisfy as well as snub various voices ( internal and external ) is a herculian task, who knows the PM could be working flat out to get the issue sorted out. I also appreciate the decent way you have put your thoughts, unlike Tewari. Always like to read your column.

Firstly, I agree that Modi Sarkar has been less than honourable when it comes to OROP. Having made a commitment and thereafter having repeated it personally, the failure to pay up is blot on Mr Modi. Even if he pays up tomorrow, the blot will remain.<br/>
Secondly, turning to you, it is even more shameful for you to write like this now that your party and you are out of power. Please show me a single public articulation by you on the lines in the piece above when your party was in power or when you were a UN bureaucrat. <br/>

                            This is a blithely made argument that ignores economic progression and reality. While the concept does sound good on paper and in politics and is a gut wrenching issue, what is not being considered is economic reality. Inflation and PPP have most certainly continued to take their toll on pensions not commensurately indexed appropriately and hence this issue. However, how does one factor in the benefits that accrued to  those ahead in time who acquired assets like real estate, gold etc at old rates and which are infinitely more valuable now ?<br/>
The Indian middle class invests in these two asset classes as a hedge against inflation and obviously, those who came first have the 'first mover' advantage.<br/>
Therefore, just a demand of equalization at current parity is a reward which cannot be , in totality , deserving.<br/>
The moral of the story for those of today is that inflation is a silent killer of one's dignity after retirement and it is essential to invest in inflation proof assets. Of course, Indian ethos also means that children will continue to support parents and this , hopefully, continues to be inculcated.

                            Holding rajya sabha hostage and not letting bills passed for a stupid reasons of conversions. Good job by modi to bring an ordinance and clear the bills because for modi its always nation first and for congress its family first

                            BTW what were you doing when you were ruling the country ? You could have brought in this 'One Rank One Pension' reform.

                            Mr Tharoor, A very good article and the matter should be paid attention to. I niether support congress nor BJP but my only question is what were you doing to push this matter when congress was in power? I hope you pushed the matter with the same intensity as you are now.

                            Agreed,armed forces are far more professional and competent than the beurocracy. They should be taken care of.

                            Agree with Tharoor -100% too...One Rank One Pension definitely more important than statue...and has been approved by SC and our forces have been waiting for it for far too long!<br/>
Get on with it Mr Modi- 26 Jan looks like a good day to announce it-except you don't make the speech then-n I suppose you would like to announce this thing yourself-how about 10 jan in Ramlila Maidan- when you will be begging for yet more votes?<br/>
Ahh right -that is not to fulfil promises but to make new ones-which you have no plans of keeping too...<br/>
Oh well- leave it to you then..-must be done ASAP though

                            When CONgress was in Govt. Shashi and his party men were too busy in Scams and loot. But now out of work, love for soldiers showing up. There is a name for it and it is called crocodile tears.

                            I think Tharoor  can not use his energy on sincere NATION building,  This is culture of all Congressmen. He  has  full right to criticize
