Headline::::Open Letter to Gajendra Chauhan from a Former Film Student



DateTime::::2015-07-14T15:28:00+05:30




                                Dear Mr Gajendra Chauhan,
Greetings. I write to you today not as a journalist but as a former student of films at one of the country's most reputed institutions, SCM Sophia, a student who often travelled to the Film Institute in Pune (FTII) and whose top memories include that of veteran filmmaker Kumar Shahani explaining the sociological relevance of films like Ritwik Ghatak's 'Meghe Dhaka Tara' and its representation of the milieu it belonged to.
But it is you, Mr Chauhan, who have occupied the imagination of most film-makers, artists and students ever since you were appointed as Chairman of the prestigious FTII which gave us craftsmen like Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani and Om Puri.
With due respect to your body of work Sir, for no work of art should be treated with disdain, I was horrified when you on a national prime time debate called your films 'Jungle Love' and 'Khuli Khidki' silver jubilee films with a social message. Something tells me, Sir, that you must have cringed while watching a rerun of the debate, which saw Anupam Kher asking you to stop defending the indefensible. I am sure, Sir, it must have shaken you to the core when your students refused to accept you as the Chairman?
Do you realize, Sir, that none of these students have a personal agenda against you, but a justified anger? How can an individual whose body of work refuses to inspire be asked to steer an institute to greater heights and push the boundaries of excellence in the field of art? And at the risk of hurting your sentiment as a member of the prestigious film industry of India, let me tell you, Sir, that your appointment is embarrassing for students of cinema, and that embarrassment stems from various aspects.
Let me give you an example, and I hope that as somebody who appreciates cinema, you will understand where this comes from. Every Tuesday, we students would wait with bated breath for our head of department to screen a film that ranged from Francois Truffat's 'The 400 Blows', one of the most famous films of the French New wave, to his counterpart Ghatak's 'Bari Theke Paliye'.
We would get goosebumps through the screening of Pather Panchali and Saeed Mirza's 'Naseem'. These were important films that gave us a glimpse of history of the times they chose to represent.
The best part of the screening would come when the likes of Shyam Benegal or Kumar Shahni took us through the analysis and the artisanship that went into the making of the film. 
Can you imagine how disappointed the students of FTII would be when they try to understand the significance of your body of work which cites films like 'Jungle Ka beta', 'Vaasna', 'Khuli Khidki', 'Reshma', 'Jungle Love'? Films that you chose to believe are A-category because they ran houseful. I am sorry, Sir, but you and I both are well aware that semi-porn films across the globe run to full houses.
The FTII has alum who have placed India on a global map. From Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Jaya Bachchan, Kundan Shah, Mani Kaul to Smita Patil, Om Puri, Naseeruddin Shah, Renu Saluja, Resul Pookutty - the list runs long.
When the likes of Jahnu Barua, Santosh Sivan and Pallavi Joshi resign from the FTII society to register their protest you must realize sir that this is not a personal battle nor is the FTII a battlefield for politics.
Films form an integral part of Indian history; art and its mentoring needs to be in the hands of those who have toiled for years, gained exposure to international forms of it, and witnessed the revolution in Cinema to be able to pass on learnings to new generations. Sir, please let go of that ego and pride and ask if you consider yourself at par with the eminent artists and personalities who have served as Chairman of the Governing Council in the past.
Do you consider yourself at par with Shyam Benegal, Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak, U.R. Anantmurthy, Girish Karnad, Mahesh Bhatt and Vinod Khanna who have been inspiring figures for FTII? Wouldn't your career as a committed film artiste have required you to make Mumbai your karmabhoomi - this is the city which hosts film festivals like MAMI, the Mumbai Film Festival, where cutting-edge independent cinema from India and across the globe is screened. Some of these films have been censored in their respective countries for offending the political sensibilities. Why is it that over the years, none of us ever saw your participation and encouragement for any such film festivals?
We have not objected to you being a member of the BJP whose youth members have famously vandalized film screenings - from the set of Deepa Mehta's 'Water' in Varanasi to Parzaania which was not allowed to be screened in theatres. 
This, though, Gajendra ji, is not a choice between a Leftist and Rightist ideology as it has made out to be by your friends in the political spectrum. Your friends conveniently forget that Adoor Gopalakrishnan, who has been labelled a leftist, is the proud father of Aswathi Dorje; she is the police officer who was once in the thick of anti-Naxal operations.
You, Sir, have acted in the Mahabharata, so you must remember Eklavya, the Hindu prince who honoured the iconic king you played, Yudhisthira, with his shoes, and cut off his thumb to honour his guru, Dronacharya. That's the respect, Sir, that culturally India has accorded to the Guru. So you will understand that nothing can be more humiliating for a teacher whose student disrespects him. 
For the sake of the profession, sir...it's not too late.
Sincerely,

                            I read today in TOI that students at FTII are subsidized by 12 laksh per annum. Why does out money needs to be given as subsidy for these people ? What good they are doing to the society except for filling up their pockets. I am against this subsidy to FTII. Fund your own studies Rana Ayub like everyone else does. Stop asking for alms for my tax money.

                            Very well written Article by Ms.Ayyub.<br/><br/>
However, this controversy must also be Treated as an Opportunity to Raise Larger Issues of "FTII Functioning" or rather Non-Functioning. On NDTV last evening, Gul Panag made an excellent point about the Process of Selection, and that all Govt's, whether past or present, have chosen people with leanings towards them.<br/><br/>
Further, there are various issues of "Students staying back at FTII and not having completed their graduation in time, as much as 4-5 years delay".<br/><br/>
And The biggest issue also, is the Fundamental Question, what Business does Govt. of India have in running a FILM institute? and spending 12 lacs per student per year, double of Medical, Engg etc.<br/><br/>
Is it not time for GoI to pull out of this institute in a Time-Bound Manner?<br/><br/>
I hope such Larger questions are also answered as this controversy is solved.<br/><br/>
and yes of course, Mr.Chauhan must gracefully resign and save the Govt headache.

and instead of preaching him to be eklavya why dont all you anti-indian / anti-hindu leftists do eklavya for a change and instead of instigating revolt against him try to calm students and give him a fair chance to see how he performs....

                            As per reports in newspapers, at least 4 former FTII directors, namely Mr.Anwar Jamal Kidwai, Mr. S.M.H Burney, Mr.R.K.Laxman, Mr. U.R.Ananthamurthy, had not made, acted, directed, written or were not even remotely connected with a single film in their lives. So what's wrong with Gajendra Chouhan? After all FTII director is an administrative post &amp; not a creative post. Its like saying only Cricketers of eminence should occupy the BCCI posts. Is it because Mr. Chouhan is known for his role in the Epic Mahabharata, which makes all the SECULAR INTELLECTUALS angry?

The govt just wants to take India to dark age, with power being in the hands of sadhus, sadhvis, babas, bapus, maharajs, sants, swamis, gurus, rishis etc., who are BJP MPs sleeping in Parliament during session, watching inappropriate videos and riding in BMWs or Audi Q7s at the cost of the common man tax payer.

Why don't you accept that your tribe's idelogical hegemony was destroyed in May'14 notwithstanding the millions of dollors of foreign donations from the Salafists that you drained out trying every bit to stop NaMo. You have been defeated. Period.<br/>
As far as your self proclaimed "liberal" values, I quote this:-<br/><br/>
"Very early in my life I found that those who pretend to be champions of liberaism, are amongst the most prejudiced and closed-minded people"

                            I don't think that Mr Gajendra Chauhan will have the patience to read this. Even if he happens to read, he may not be able to comprehend the real message of this article. If he has any self-respect left in him, he should relinquish the post for some deserving candidate, instead of clinging to a post for which he is most undeserving. But I don't have even the slightest hope that the BJP bhaktas will allow him to resign and leave honorably.

May be it was his genuine bad luck that he didnt get good opportunities after Mahabharat...May be he could try his luck in standing for elections just as Ms. Irani and who knows becomes I&amp;B minister. <br/><br/>
The thing that saddens is the all this is happening under the aegis of the PM and he is for reasons best known to him, selectively destroying (thats the impression coming through) certain reputed institutions!

                            What kind of silly argument protesters are giving for opposing Mr. Chauhan...<br/><br/><br/>
1. Student's opinion didn't consider in his appointment :In how many appointments till now student's opinion was considered?  Even from school to colleges - when appointment principal or chairman or director or president - no one ask student's opinion. It is management decided who would best admin the institute. <br/><br/>
2. He has not enough experience : he has more than 35 years of experience with film &amp; television industry. what more one can expect from chairman?<br/><br/>
3. He is not inspiring figure - at the age of 22+, when you are working in country's most premiere institute, one can't look chairman to inspire. You must have some other role model to inspire yourself....you may inspire yourself. I don't know from school to colleges - how many places principal was inspiring figure. Remember - principal or chairman is there for administration. Not for teaching or inspiring. <br/><br/>
4. His appointment is political one - so till now all appointment were political one. Why no protest earlier<br/><br/>
5. It is undemocratic - what is undemocratic? In democracy, everyone consider to be equal and has right to work anywhere if s/he meets basic qualification.  If Mr. Chauhan meets basic qualification, he has right to work there if appointed by government. Insisting on big name is undemocratic - you are judging on person based on his fame....which is undemocratic one.<br/><br/>
6. Big name dropped and he was selected - naturally when government selects one from 10 nominee, 9 are going to be dropped or rejected whether there names are big or small. And so called big names have there priorities different - they all are busy with multi crores projects and would hardly give time to institute. Mr. Chauhan has promised government to give full time to institute which would be benefit to government<br/><br/>
7. Relationship with financier - NIFT depends on government for all financial aid. If chairman has good repo with government, he would help institute to get more grants and this would be beneficial to students &amp; institutes.<br/><br/>
But student are protecting as government has planned to sack out all students who are staying NIFT hostels even after 3 years and are not able complete course in 3 years. They are in there 35 years but yet gets NIFT subsidy for there hostels &amp; foods. Now they are protecting this appointment so when tomorrow government takes any action they can say it is vendetta <br/><br/>
let see how many more days they continue there strike. they have wasted there valuable one month....

Please ask them to leave the institute. We don't need such unique creativity at the expense of people's money.

                            OK, the sentiments of the artistically inclined are appreciated. Perhaps Chauhan should not have been selected. But there are a few issues. First, Chauhan did not select himself. He was selected by the I&amp;B Ministry, and protests, if any, should be directed there. It is unnecessary to insult Chauhan publicly for what is not his fault. Secondly, who decides what is A grade cinema? There is no accounting for tastes. Just because you claim to have superior tastes, does it mean that others have no right to their choices? The films mentioned in the article, especially foreign ones, are what may be called art films. And most of them do not make money. Which is not particularly good for any industry. The public prefers corny action films, potboilers and tearjerkers with no so called artistic value. They are not interested in art films. So should a bunch of FTII students decide what the public should watch? For God's sake, we are a democracy. Thirdly, every institution first needs discipline. It is not for the FTII students or their misguided supporters to decide who the Director of the institute should be. That power has been vested in the government, and that power cannot be easily challenged without voting out the government. If every government institute including the IITs, IIMs etc. started appointing Directors who suited the whims of the students, we would have a massive mess everywhere. The government in its wisdom has decided that Chauhan fitted the bill. And last, listen to what Chauhan himself said. Give him a chance. See if his performance is so bad. Then decide if he is fit to continue, and petition the government if he is not. The FTII does not require an inspiring Director. Merely an efficient one. And disciplined students.

Your article points to no great achievements. My suspicion is that Mr. Chauhan, not having achieved as much as the luminaries, might actually do something in his job, especially since people like you have made a ruckus.

                            We live in a performance based culture, it is not your eminence but performance matters. Even a Nobel Laureate may get fired from his job if he does not add value. How is it that FTII is in a mess with 39 strikes and students taking double the time to pass out, even with stars heading the institute? Students will regain their perspective if Government withdraws subsidies from fees charged. When you pay fees from hard earned money of your parents, you will think twice before you go on such prolonged strikes.

                            Is there any Selection Criteria in FTII? If No, then what basis are we judging credentials of a person? Just by making Great Films do not make good Administrators and vice versa. The problem with these institutes are that, they will NOT hesitate to take the subsidy from Government @ cost of Public Exchequer, but have problems accepting the government appointed administrator.

                            Read with interest but disappointed. List of great students stops some 30 years ago. However illustrious heads list is up until Gajendra's appointment. I don't see why anyone should think Pallavi joshi is talented as an artist. You can oppose Gajendra that is your choice but then what are you doing to improve the institution?

                            Well thanks to the open letter of the Anti-Indian and Anti-BJP paid and agenda driven journalist, Rana Ayub, it will be easy for the government to completely back the appointment of Gajendra Chauhan to the Film Institute in Pune (FTII). The Government  mantra should be do opposite of everything that Rana Ayub suggests in National Interest.

                            Well people who were eager to see an idiot as PM of India are hurt as a not so rich actor was made chairman of Film Institute. Also, she forgets as a chairman he is not going to be on campus nor teach students....that job rests with director and teaching faculty.....

                            They should have protested when Mahesh bhatt was appointed. What good he has done for the film industry? Except one or two,all of his films are cheap/B grade copies of foreign films. No one prorested that time. And Gajendra chauhan is an actor.Dharmendra and Mithun chakraborty had done numerous B grade movies too. But no one can question their potential and talent. I am not supporting that his appointment is correct but students and other people should judge him on his capability not credentials. Let him prove whether his worth of it or not.

                            Nonsense. principal is never appointed by students or public. It seems those passed out this institute making fun of system . Never try to create indiscipline atmosphere. I even recommend armygeneral to steer the institutes.

                            Only NDTV is giving too much importance to FTII Chairman 's Post and the Strike by its Students. I know Gajendra Chouhan as the Person who played the role of Yduhuistara in BR Chopra's Mahabharata Serial.During the last SOnia Rahul Priyanka's Congress led UPA Rule all Posts were given to Anti Hindutwa and even Anti Hindu People. Are not People like Girish Karnad Congress Sooges?.All these so called Left Wing Artistes supported ignorant Rahul Rajiv for PM Post. Leaving all that is it students that elect the head of their Institution? I am a POst Graduate of 1967 from Andhra University during which time the standards of Education were very high.Even in those days there were some who joined educational Institutes onl;y to conduct strikes.Heavens will not fall even if FTII is closed once and for all.Great Directors like Sathyajit Roy,Shanata Ram,BN Reddy,KV Re4ddy,LV Prasad and actors like Dilip Kumar,Devanaand,Legendray NT Rama Rao and so many great technicians did not come from FTII.

                            The reference to Late Ritwik Kr. Gatak's film "Meghe Dhaka Taara" by the author is astounding!<br/>
Independence came with devastating partition pangs for Punjab, Bengal and Assam. Among other social issues in the movie, Ghatak brought forth the agonising aftermath of partition as faced by a middle class family of Bengal refugees. If the author finds Ghatak so relevant, what does she feel about the post - 1947 Bengal refugees? And plans for their "re-settlement" at Dandakaranya and the Andamans? The author claims to be looking for progressive realism - by God! Hypocrisy must have some limit!

                            The price of the mistake committed by Eklavya is being paid by generation after generation of common people. In our society, Guru has all the right to commit atrocities but Shishya has to follow sincerity if he or she belongs to common people. Thus, one should not expect that somebody will say that I am useless please do not appoint me or somebody is more deserving than me please appoint him or her. Conventionally, people do not like ethics or moral to be followed in practical life and by mistakes those practice it people put frame around them. Most of the post-independence generation is not much use to such things but will get use to it very soon and sounds, slogan of decent will fade away with passing time.
