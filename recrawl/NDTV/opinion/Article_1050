Headline::::Smriti Irani Pulped Her Critics In Parliament



DateTime::::2016-02-25T20:33:00+05:30




                                Listening to Smriti Irani responding to the Hyderabad and JNU student incidents on the floor of the House was mesmerising. It will remain historical for all times as one of the finest defence-attack speeches in parliament. It left "All the Men" and a "Few Women" speechless.
One could feel and see them awestruck. It was as if some gigantic force had hit them. Perhaps anticipating this, some "honorables" exited for they could not see themselves being pulped and trashed for their lies and hypocrisy so meticulously, piece by piece, bit by bit...
Smriti's entire life learning and the challenges she faced all along, which made her a woman of platinum as she is, came through every word, gesture and expression.
She backed every clarification with systematic evidence, which I relished most as a former cop. This is the most irrefutable way to demolish scheming adversaries when it is a vitriolic war of survival.
She has been facing their wrath right from Day One of her taking charge of the Ministry of Human Resources. Many times, the war between her detractors and her was one-sided for those who are bitten by her ascendance had easy access to and generous space in print and visual media. Panel after panel blared giving time to them to spit their venom against her, hurling all kinds of innuendoes. She did not come back always to counter. She let the barking dogs bark till either they would get tired or listeners had something more scintillating to hear.
This time she proved irrefutably why our Prime Minister included her in his Council of Ministers: he knew her capability, capacity, and extraordinary brilliance to articulate with courage and due diligence.
She laid out para by para why our children have grown up doubting India's rich heritage and its legends and asked why are they not proud of their lineage.
It was the way history books for children have been written by some writers who are alleged to be of doubtful credentials. Also, the manner in which these are being taught by teachers who are a by-product of the same contamination.
Bit by bit, day after day, Smriti Irani seems to be sweating to plough, extract, de-weed, re-seed, much to the chagrin of all those pseudo, entrenched, retired detractors regurgitating what was taught to them (Perhaps they chose to be fossilised and convinced that they alone knew best.)
There is a humongous work ahead for the HRD ministry. Smriti Irani as a mother realises that whatever she gets corrected or modified will create another generation of responders - ones who could either be at at war within and vulnerable to saboteurs, or those who grow up as alert citizen-soldiers in defence of the integrity of their own motherland while having the fundamental right to air their grievances (while doing so never allowing infidels to hijack them).
And certainly they must never ever share a platform with those questioning India's geographical boundaries, or blasting pillars of our hard-earned democracy.
Hence never befriend an enemy of the country, even if he shares a room, or a class. Change him if you can. Watch him as your duty. Remember your duty towards your mother-land.
Smriti's expose in parliament underlines the Herculean inadequacies inherited by this government in the errors of history as she substantiated.
An important question to ask ourselves: Is it this government's duty alone to save the future generations from these Himalayan blunders? Or is it not for every teacher and parent to ensure their sons and daughters are proud citizens of India? The sort who will know enough to distinguish between who is for Vision versus those for Division and some of course just for Television.(Kiran Bedi is the first woman to have joined officer ranks of Indian Police Service. Recipient of Magsaysay Award (1994) for police and prison reforms, she has also worked as a UN police advisor. A tennis champion, she earned a PhD from IIT Delhi and is a Nehru Fellow. She's founded many NGOs and is the author of several books.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Indeed it is great speech . really shocking that Teesta was allowed to write NCERT books for children. How was she chosen  ?  this is shocking and disgrace .  Sonia, Kapil sibal  still preach  secularism. Teesta as social activist. No other country has such tolerance as India has.

                            Dr Rajasree Malpath said when she came to examine Rohith, he had been dead for two hours.<br/><br/>
 "There was no pulse or blood pressure. His body was cold, tongue was protruding and rigor mortis had set in," the doctor told <br/><br/>
A video of Rohith's body on the day he hung himself also shows policemen, which contradicts the minister's claim that the police were not allowed near the body till the next morning.<br/><br/>

                            There is no doubt that Irani's speech in Parliament yesterday will go in to history as THE BEST one could have seen and heard. My word what an articulation ,what command of language and what clarity. if only she had bee allowed to continue, she would have gone on and on and on and would have torn the entire opposition into shreds.  For the matter of fact, people like us watching her on TV literally  got mesmerized. Must have seen this speech over and over again so many times that I lost count of it.  Was this the aggression PM wanted his law makers to show in the Parliament? BJP definitely has briefed their law makers very well. A great homework done by Smriti  and hats off to her. Rahul should have been in the Parliament when Smriti was roaring and would have loved to see his reaction.

                            She made one of the most dramatic and fierce-full counter-attacks Parliament has seen. When people from non-political backgrounds enter politics and find their integrity questioned based on fake claims, they do break-down easily. She must not be blamed for her emotional speech. Moreover, her speech was far more than just emotional - amply supported by facts and documents. Sugata Bose speaks very well without any doubt, and what he spoke really made sense, but I doubt that in the name of allowing students to make mistakes and making them learn from their mistakes, he may risk demoralizing our troops guarding the borders. The opposition and the government need to develop a habit of meeting each more frequently especially whenever there is a crisis like situation. Whatever happened be it Mr Vermula's suicide or JNU students raising slogans, should not have turned into a political storm to the extent that the parliament log-jams. The government and the opposition need to learn from these two issues and ensure that if in future such a situation ever occurs they behave as responsible parties rather than school children.

Whatever said and done , She has been harassing the educational institutions and a puppet to bring in to effect what the BJP polluted think heads wants.<br/><br/>
Remember she was the one who wanted all children to come to school on Christmas. She is the one who wanted Yoga to be introduced to schools. <br/><br/>
These guys have an agenda and they must complete it before 5 years is complete coz they now knw they cannot stand long with so many ideologies within one flag. <br/><br/>
BjP s truly an unfied force with unidentified an multiple ideologies. This also can be called polygamy of ideas

More of a TV-Serial style drama, crocodile tears, mis-placed emotions. And 56 inch who has never commented about all these ABVP arrogance, is tweeting Smiti speech. The whole thing looked like a good PR drama.

                            Completely agree with both Kiranji and Smritiji. Correcting the bad economic inheritance is Himalayan task. But correcting an education system inherited with generations of inaccuracies that corrupts impressionable minds and perpetuate with unbridled force is mightily Herculean task. After seeing Smritiji live on loksabha TV during the classic debate , I am convinced she will do her role admirably.

                            Very sad that all political parties mainly Congress came down to the level of supporting anti National groups for their political benefit. By protecting the students who are anti national Congress insulted the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for our country. If, CPM supports them it can be accepted as basically CPM is the party who are funded by China but not Congress. Congress must immediately come out of the controversy to avoid further damage to the party.

                            The leftists have always been despised by Indian voters, as shown by their miserable electoral successes since Independence. Yet hey have managed to disproportionately influence education in India as also the economic policies of the government. This is one of the significant reasons India has not progressed either economically or academically. Leftist thinking basically belongs to the nineteenth century and has little relevance to today's world. The 1991 reforms broke the shackles of the economy to some extent. The academic world has not been so fortunate. Our universities, especially JNU, have been hubs of marxist thinking, which is inherently anti-national. Manmohan Singh had as far back as 2008 identified the red menace in many of our tribal and forest areas as India's most significant internal threat. The aim of any naxalite/maoist/leftist insurgency is to bring down the democratically elected government by using violence. The JNU students are only the young face of this menace and have to be handled accordingly. India needs educational reforms as badly as economic reforms, and Smriti Irani is doing a good job, which is why the left and the pseudo left like the Congress are trying to discredit her.

Despite smashed the entire opposition it's wonder to see playing the victim of woman and micro-minority cards.

She lied through her teeth about no attempt being made to revive Rohith and that the cops weren't allowed in for several hours etc. She's just another talking head for the ruling junta

I am sure you will lose, with more votes polled in favour, than Delhi.Only for the  sympathy and respect to Mr Bedi.

                            Kiran Bedi was once a pride of India, and a role model for Indian Women. Now, she is cheering for a ministrs oratory skills. People have realised the true colour of Modi and his party that all of his promises were just an election gimmick,and the only difference between Modi and Manmohan is oratory skills of Modi. India is still ruled by corporates especially reliance and oil prices are still high. Bihar and Delhi elections have already proved the discontent of people. instead of travelling all over India and realise people of India, our Prime minister is on a world tour. I really dont understand why Kiran Bedi still supports BJP.

A pulped Kiran Bedi can only write such tributes to (not so well educated) HRD minister. Kiran Bedis's achievements in her career are far more superior than Smriti Irani. Do not undermine your achievements Kiran Bedi.

Change him if you can. Watch him as your duty. Remember your duty towards your mother-land." made me say Oh-please!<br/><br/>
While it's a completely correct statement, but for BJP members, "Practice before you preach!" Please tell your party to first bring the same into practice with PDP (who is a clear supporter of Afzal Guru &amp; has sided more with the separatists than has ever shown any commitments with India) in J&amp;K then speak out or send such examples to the youth.

                            Good and eloquent speakers like Smritiji are always few.It is true that parents more than teachers have to come forward to protect their wards from being indoctrinated by untruthful and venomous contents in the school  text books authored by and launched by the vested interests. But it is a pity that it seems no parent had time to look into these text book aberrations, as objections ought to have poured in and inundated by public outrage are apparently absent or the parents are unable to find a forum to express.Actually it is the job of the media to bring into focus these issues.Unfortunately the media is collapsed in the country.<br/><br/>
The time is ripe for people like Kiran Bediji who has come up with the idea should take the lead to form a forum and devise means and a medium for the parents for projecting these evils, before our children are infested and reach the institutions like the JNU.

                            You mentioned that "never befriend an enemy of the country". That was the reason you joined BJP. You are an opportunist. We remember your election speech.  <br/><br/>
Ms Iranians a TV serial actress who knows how to play drama. The doctor who examined Rohit contradict her claim. Shame on you. We can expect such cheap blog from you as you have obliged to support BJP. Earlier I had an administration to you. Now I lost it.
