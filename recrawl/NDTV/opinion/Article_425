Headline::::NDTV.com Exclusive: Will Work Readily With PM for Bihar, Writes Nitish Kumar



DateTime::::2015-02-22T00:56:00+05:30



(Nitish Kumar has taken oath as the Chief Minister of Bihar for the fourth time today.)
	I am humbled by the opportunity to serve the people of Bihar.
	Historians confidently say that the glorious history of ancient India is the history of ancient Bihar. However, it is common knowledge today that Bihar is the poorest state in India and can independently be rated among the poorest state of its size in the world.
	Is this all? I do not think so. I believe that Bihar is the state of greatest potential in the country, and the story of developed India is not possible without the story of developed Bihar. I have and will continue to work forever to make this a reality.
	Even a simple analysis of the model of strength, weakness, opportunity, and threats to its progress can outline the potential of Bihar. The strength of Bihar lies in its people especially its women and youth, its fertile land, abundant water resources, the thousands of years of its rich heritage, and a rapidly expanding multi-skilled diaspora.
	At the same time, the state faces multiple weak fronts. For decades, Bihar lagged behind the rest of the country in the development of basic infrastructure and institutions which is not the case with any rich and better developed state in India. The deficit in infrastructure and institutions has led to a deep deficit in knowledge creation. In addition, Bihar is land-locked. After Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar, the state was left with no natural resources. So there are inherent weaknesses that the state has to deal with.
	However, the future is bright. While no one can take away the strengths of Bihar, one can work in a systematic manner on the weaknesses. This is where the greatest opportunity exists. No state can gain as much from policy formulations and good governance as Bihar. The Central Government has the responsibility to bridge the yawning regional disparity of the country through supportive policy formulations. The Special Category Status is one such policy measure. Merely investing in Bihar to achieve parity in basic infrastructure of road, rail, power, education, and health will propel the state's economy. Leadership and governance will play a key role in ensuring that Bihar gets its due and that projects are executed in time to achieve the necessary infrastructural and institutional upgrade.  
	Bihar today can leapfrog several steps in development through the use of technology. A digitally-powered Bihar will be able to deliver better quality education, healthcare, and social welfare to all in a cost-effective manner. The upgrade in basic infrastructure of the state, better education and training of the youth, resilient law and order, and availability of electricity will set the much-needed foundation for investments and entrepreneurship. This is where lending from banks will play a key role in driving the growth of the private sector. In this frame, no matter where you see, there is a role for investment - be it in developing the infrastructure, upgrading the knowledge and skills of the youth, or enabling investments and entrepreneurship. The investment case of Bihar is simple and will provide time-bound returns to the investor, state, and society.
	In addition, work must continue on the Agricultural Roadmap laid down by the state to lead India into the second green revolution which I often conceptualize as a Rainbow Revolution. Bihar is a land of small farmers who own the most fertile land of the country. The Agricultural Roadmap clearly lays down the policy approach to make agriculture significantly more productive.  
	Urbanization is another key area where Bihar is at the fore-front of opportunity. Today, only one in nine persons in Bihar lives in an urban area. This is naturally set to rise and at least double in less than a decade. The state can ride this phenomenon by ensuring that the emerging urban centres of Bihar are planned better, have power, and become anchors for job creation. With modern technologies, this can be achieved at a faster pace with predictable outcomes.
	A key opportunity for Bihar is the large and diversified skill and resource base of the non- resident people of the state. Their connect with Bihar is not just limited to property and their extended family which is still living in the state, but it is also deeply emotional and drives their interest to work for development of Bihar. I see tremendous potential in channeling the knowledge, resources and aspiration of non-resident Biharis towards the development agenda of the state.
	I am also fully awakened to the threats that Bihar faces on a constant basis. One, the state is vulnerable to natural disasters mainly in the form of floods and drought. The threat which is already high can further rise due to climate change. Two, caste and religion play a defining role in our densely populated and poor state. Therefore, Bihar is vulnerable to injustice, inaction and divisiveness. While proactive governance is the way to mitigate the risk of natural disasters, the only way to make the state resilient on the social front is the approach of Development with Justice. The Government in Bihar has to be able to drive Development, deliver its fruits to the weakest section, and continuously strengthen social harmony. Nowhere in the world have divisive policies and politics transformed a poor state. So, the only way forward for Bihar is strong leadership, good governance and development with justice.
	Even this simple analysis of the  strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats outlines the tremendous potential that the state has. My vision is to realize this potential. The strengths must be tapped - youth must have skills to compete and contribute, women must be able to play their rightful role in society, the productivity of our land must rise, the utilization of water resources must be productive, and people from across the world must be able to experience our rich cultural heritage. The weaknesses have to be alleviated. No matter what it takes, Bihar has to achieve parity in infrastructure, institutions and knowledge. This is the responsibility of the state and the central government.
	Often, people speak about the missed opportunities of Bihar. Not anymore. My vision is to set the approach that Bihar will ride with  the opportunities ahead of us. Our youth, girls and boys  - and they are in tens of millions -  will be trained better and enabled more than those in any other state. Our cities and towns will provide good living standards and job opportunities. And the state will be developed into a hub for entrepreneurs and investors. Alongside, our villages will be vibrant and self- sufficient. This time Bihar will not just participate but in fact lead the second green revolution.
	As I work towards these goals, I must also highlight the most important public message. I will strive to build a state which emerges forever from the shadow of narratives of bad governance. The idea and fear that Bihar can snap back to any regime of unaccountable governance and law and order must be erased from people's hearts and minds.
	My principal strength is the ability to provide good governance, inclusive growth and social harmony. As I have tried in the last nine years, I aspire to build a state where this strength becomes institutionalized. And as I would continue to try forever, I aspire to build a state that confidently carries the narrative of positive future, vibrant culture and resilient harmony.
	And in doing so, I will readily work with the honourable Prime Minister and the Government of India in the interest of Bihar.

I was one of your admirer and looked upto you to end the jungle Raj. But due to your hatred, ego and jealousy you have cheated and let down the entire state and in a way the country too. Doesn't your conscience prick even a little when you join hands with Lalu-Rabri gang today. You are a disgrace and hope people teach you a befitting lesson in the elections.

                            Bihar was doing so good under him and really wished in the "interest of Bihar" he should have continued. But unfortunately, i would see the "ego" came in (how come i will work under Mr Modi) and damn the "interest of Bihar" went to the bin. If it was moral responsibility of the Lok sabha elections then why to become the CM again? Has it automatically fixed the morality? One tangible way was to fight without being the CM and win the Bihar again.<br/><br/>
The ultimate aim of an ego is not to see something, but is to be something. My two cents..

                            Mr. Nitish Kumar has bungled thrice in a row to promote the welfare of Bihar although he can take cover being a secular, neutral and a visionary statesman for Bihar. Does he apologize for all the following actions : 1. Leaving NDA and pitching against Modi and losing miserably to promote the welfare by being a part of the central administration bringing more funds to Bihar.  2. Being emotional and leaving the Headship of Bihar and anointing Mr. Manjhi to be the CM. 3. Joining hands with the past arch rival, Mr. Lalu P. Yadav well known for corruption. He has lost his credibility with all these moves. Has he got answers/apology for all of the above?

                            The opening statement itself is subject to ridicule. How can Nitish Kumar be 'humbled' by the opprotunity to serve Bihar when he himself was the cause and reason behind the toppling of Manjhi's government? His analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the state are well indeed but one cannot help but ask what the hell did he do all these years of a decade when he ruled the roost  in Patna?  For God's sake stop blaming the Center for all your ills but do something at the bottomline for Bihar.The first and foremost thing to be done in Bihar is to get the people out of their stupid and shortsighted caste thinking.

                            Mr Nitish: I cheered for you when you went house to house to rout Laloo gang of jungle raj and really hoped that you succeed. Do you even remember how hard was it to uproot the jungle raj? BJP gave you 100% support all these years. Then your EGO came to full flow and now you are in this position of writing such letters. Bihar is poor? What were you doing for 9 years? Did you not get package from your friend Congress? You won with BJP as partner. When you decided to break away from BJP you should have dissolved the assembly and gone for fresh mandate.  What we the people need is clean politics and I thought you are one such person. But you disappointed me.

                            Congratulations Sir for again taking responsibility of Bihar.I am fully agree with your views to how to drive Bihar growth.<br/>
My small suggestion for you you are talking about non resident Biharis.As a medical student I came out of Bihar to pursue my MBBS as there was very less seat in Bihar in 2006 now I want to go back to Bihar to serve my own ppl But your government changed the rule in 2006 saying Biharis who studied outside Bihar are not eligible to write PG entrance for Bihar Medical college.If I will take seat in the state where I did MBBS then I have to serve that state for 5 years nd bcos of that I m unable to serve my own Biharis ppl.Punjab Orissa MP Karnataka Andhra TN Kerala all allow their own permanent resident students to persue PG in Medical in their respective native states irrespective of from where they have done MBBS so by this way these states are able to keep their Doctors in their state and serve their ppl.Kindly think about this and allow all Biharis students like me to write Bihar PG for MD MS so that we can come back to Bihar and serve our own people.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

                            Let me first congratulate you for making course correction honorable cm designate and assured you there is large portion of people of bihar who see you as one of best leader available in bihar in terms of Good governance, development, and any kind of justice be it social, religious, freedom, economical and opportunity.<br/>
Sir you rightly point out when you see it on simple analysis of the model of strength, weakness, opportunity, and threats to its progress of Bihar you find out tremendous potential for bihar. But every things change when we see the last two year of bihar &amp; development in this year on all front or deliverable you wish to pursue, it shed enough reason to believe the same simple analysis &amp; your kind wisdom - which you earned in your over four decade of public life – were not basis for decision of your good self &amp; for that matter GOB. Story would have been different if same simple analysis and your kind wisdom had been the basis of decision in all these year.<br/>
Sir you kindly acknowledge that initial seven year of your administration, your work were doing the talking &amp; earning lots of appreciation &amp; confidence of the people of Bihar &amp; non-resident of bihar than your current eloquent voice of Mr. Verma &amp; Tyagi without any substance.<br/>
Sir   let me put an example, you made promise to electorate of Bihar about electricity and made enough work to fulfill the same and was appeared to achievable but same has been ruined in last couple of year that makes your task so difficult to reinstalled it on track and even compel you to seek more time from the people of bihar.  More or less same can be said to your all initiative.<br/>
In days to come people will judge you largely on the basis of your agenda you set yourself and with vigor you pursue it not one the basis of your leaning of left, right &amp; center and new friend, enemy and all that.<br/>
May god give you enough blessing to meet all dreams you have for the people of Bihar.<br/>
And sir G do forgive me if I may have become bit emotional in the process of expressing opinion.

                            Nitish Kumar was expecting to be the consensus prime ministerial candidate in the NDA regime. But when Narendra Modi was made the leader of the BJP campaign and thereafter nominated as the prime ministerial candidate, Nitish could not digest this. He broke the alliance with the BJP citing high moral grounds. After every election rally by Modi, Nitish would take it upon himself to tear into him. After elections and the JD(U) rout in Bihar, Nitish once again took a high moral ground and resigned from the chief ministership of Bihar taking responsibility for the defeat. BUT...BUT...the scene changed rapidly after his puppet CM Jiten Kumar Manjhi decided to move out from under his wings and started exercising his authority. It is after this that we are seeing Nitish Kumar as he really is...a power hungry, egotistical and morally corrupt person. People of Bihar need to recognise this person for what he is and not get influenced by what he portrays himself as.

                            An egotistical politician like Nitish will never succeed.  His dishonest resignation as CM and appointment of Manji in his place while all the time being the power behind the throne has been exposed.  In his articles, he is full of homilies and platitudes.  He fails to mention that Bihar is riddled with corruption and that he has jumped into bed with the most corrupt politician Bihar has ever produced, namely Lalu.  He has also jumped into bed with the likes of Mulayam Singh and other corrupt UP politicians.  Obviously, he needs support to achieve his ambition to become India's PM.  Nitish has also failed to mention that millions of Biharis have left the state of Bihar and are ensconced in the slums of other states of India such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and many, many more.  It is time Nitish recognised that his state, Bihar makes little or no contribution to the well being of India.  An egotistical CM of a failed state who wants a major say in India should be firmly put in his place.

                            I visit Bihar once/twice a year since 1973 when I was a kid. I had seen visible positive changes during Nitishji's spells as CM.The best talent in the country is available in/ from Bihar.This is evident from the pass-outs Civil Services and Banking exams and the locals position in MNCs and Foreign Banks.Club this talent pool with the available resources and the State can work wonders. The only requirement is political wisdom sans dirty politics.

                            This could have been achieved by joint effort of all parties. Bihar given mandate also for jointly working of JDU &amp; BJP. But you conveniently choosen to oust the BJP &amp; ruining Bihar progress. Even you oust BJP, then also you could have governed bihar to get its due glory, but alas again you ditched people by throwing chair to a mahadalit in hopes to gain political mileage. You did all wrong to bihar progress &amp; now claiming that its your topmost priority. Its a big hypocracy Mr. Nitish.<br/><br/>
Let the election come, bihar will choose the right person to lead from front &amp; its definately not you sir.

                            NitishJi, was so critical of Narendra Modi and challenged him/hurled abuses at him before and after the last Parliamentary election. Worst of all, he joined hands with the RJD and SP camps, besides bringing disrepute to JDU by installing and then throwing out Manjhi. All these are very bad moves for him, Bihar, JDU. He has wasted the last two years of valuable time in mudslinging, indulging in regional and vote bank politics. Nitish is now doing the Kejri stunt thinking it will work. Bihar would have improved vastly and Nitish would be enjoying much greater  power both at the Centre and in his own province had he not split the NDA. Thinktank diplomats like Pawan Verma have not offered him the wise counsel. Too late and he is now ready to go with the begging bowl again to Delhi. He did this running to Delhi while UPA was in power and he is doing the same thing now.

                            Mr.Kumar - Good luck. Atleast do some solid work this time. You political stunts last time were only media-attention grabbing and looked silly!<br/>
And I remember seeing an 'NDTV-Politician of the year' being awarded to you the last year or the year before that! How this media tries to create an illusionary web just to please their egos!

                            Nitish Kumar is a unsuccessful dramabaaz, who are always caught prentending! Better he should improve himself so that it could be good for him as well as the people of Bihar.
