Headline::::Real Agenda of RSS Pracharak-Turned-PM



DateTime::::2015-10-12T20:54:00+05:30




                                When I had my little spat with Shashi Tharoor over his praising the Modi government for its performance in its first few days of office, my main point was that the new establishment could not be assessed on the basis of its initial words and actions but in the longer perspective of the values and causes it stood for and where it wished to take the country. That view now stands vindicated.
 
For our ever-loquacious Prime Minister, whose oratorical abilities reach their heights when he is abusing the Gandhi family has, but for one brief statement, kept his mouth firmly closed while outrage at what his ideological clan are saying and doing sweeps across the liberal, secular, open-minded, freedom-loving and democratic upholders of our true nationhood. On the solitary occasion he spoke, an "exercise at deflection" as literary critic Ziya us Salam has called it, all he had to say was that Hindus and Muslims should not be fighting against each other but together fighting poverty.  
 
Well, the one who was not fighting Hindus but fighting poverty all his life was poor Mohammed Akhlaq, as was his son, Danish, still fighting for his life after two brain surgeries. But where were Hindus and Muslims fighting each other? Nowhere. There had been the cold-blooded murder of three rationalist writers, followed by the lynching of one poor village blacksmith. It was not a communal riot; it was unilateral communalism. It had in it no element of mutual Hindu-Muslim rivalry. All it amounted to was one section of vicious militant Hindus, united in their ardent support of everything Hindutva stands for, targeting individuals they hate for not sharing their views to the point of killing them and then justifying the killing.
 
It is that which the Prime Minister was called upon to condemn. He elided the question, deliberately choosing to approach the matter in broad, general terms, rather than frontally confronting his most impassioned supporters who had resorted to violence and bloodshed, and then found excuses for these gross excesses. Moreover, these impassioned supporters included several of his Ministers, his MPs and his MLAs, and assorted Hindutva activists. Not one of them has been sacked. Not one has been repudiated. No one has been reprimanded. Instead, an "advisory" has been addressed to the UP government. No advisories have been sent out to Nagpur. No pledge has been made that as far as the Sangh Parivar is concerned, this must stop. No action has been taken to signal "zero tolerance" of any such words or actions in future.
 
In consequence, the entire establishment, ranging from government ministers to the lowliest cadres, has been reassured that they might continue their mayhem with little fear of being pulled up or thrown out. The real agenda of the RSS pracharak-turned-PM is being rolled out.
 
What a contrast to Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru before and after Independence and Partition. One's memory lingers on Gandhiji at Noakhali protecting the Hindus, at Bihar protecting the Muslims, at Calcutta stopping the madness, at Delhi soothing tempers and bringing back good sense: a "One Man Boundary Force". One seems to hear today what Gandhiji cited at his prayer meeting in Birla House on 22 December 1947: "I always like to be with a minority, for a minority as a rule does not commit mistakes, and even if it does, it can be rectified. But a majority is drunk with power and it is difficult to reform it".
 
The Modi majority is drunk with power. It mistakes majority rule for majoritarian rule. It believes it has the mandate to do as it likes, even up to and including condoning murder.
 
One also recalls the immortal words of Jawaharlal Nehru at the Ram Lila grounds on Gandhi Jayanti 1951 after he had vanquished the forces of communalism within the Congress party: "If anyone raises his hand against another in the name of religion, I shall fight him till the last breath of my life, whether from within the government or outside". That is leading from the front, not hiding behind the words of the Rashtrapati in order to save himself the trouble of confronting head-on the forces of hatred and violence within his own ranks.
 
Fortunately for all of us, the last of the Nehrus is still with us. Panditji's niece, Nayantara Sahgal, has spoken and acted, returning her Sahitya Akademi award because the Akademi "remains silent" even as the Prime Minister "dare not alienate evil-doers who support his ideology". That ideology is at variance with our Constitution, for, as Vice President Hamid Ansari whom she quotes has pointed out, our Constitution promises to all citizens "liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship". This is the Constitution that "We, the People of India" - that is the Argumentative Indian - have given ourselves, incorporating the precious right to dissent. The right to dissent, whether it is I from the RSS or the RSS from me, can only be exercised if, as Nayantara says, India's "culture of diversity" is celebrated, not subjected, as it has been in recent times, to "vicious assault".
 
She has proved an exemplar with three other Sahitya Akademi award winners, Uday Prakash (who actually preceded her), Ashok Vajpeyi and Shashi Deshpande, and a host of regional Sahitya Akademi awardees - nine Kannada writers, Rahman Abbas the Urdu writer, Aman Sethi based in Delhi, GN Devy of Gujarat and three eminent Punjabi literati - following suit.
 
Vajpeyi points to our trembling "on the brink of a tyranny of uniformity and parochialism (with) violence, murder, intolerance, bans creating a fearful ethos (in which) being in a minority is almost a crime", echoing Nayantara's warning that "anyone who questions any aspect of the ugly and dangerous distortion of Hinduism known as Hindutva - whether in the intellectual or artistic sphere, or whether in terms of food habits and lifestyle - are being marginalized, persecuted, or murdered".
 
India's most renowned public intellectual, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, quoted by the Vice President, has said, "Indian democracy is a cacophony of voices. But if you scratch the surface, dissent in India labours under an immense maze of threats and interdictions". Shashi Deshpande aims straight at our conscience, individual and collective, when she points out that "silence is a form of abetment". She insists that now "is the right time for writers to reclaim their voices", to stand against "such acts of violence" and fight "the growing intolerance in our country". And Prof. Devy of Gujarat warns against the "increasing intolerance and shrinking space for dissent and free expression in the country."
 
This then is the time to remember the immortal words of Pastor Niemoller, who initially welcomed Hitler and, having kept quiet while others were being persecuted, incarcerated and killed, spent seven years in Hitler's concentration camps:
 
"First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out -
                                                          Because I was not a Socialist.
 Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out -
                                                          Because I was not a Trade Unionist.
  Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out -
                                                          Because I was not a Jew.
  Then they came for me - and there was no one left to speak for me."
 
Before it comes to that in our much-valued secular democracy, it is, as Rahman Abbas has stressed while returning his award, "our duty to raise our voices against fascism, right-wing intolerant forces and lawlessness." Will we rise to the occasion - or "not speak out" NOW?(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

I totally agree! Modiji seems to think that whatever he says/do/or doesn't do has the support of majority. It doesn't. 31% of Indians voted for Modiji for DEVELOPMENT, not for nutcase regligious rashtra.

Till voters are voting for Modi, Modi doesn't need to bothered about such writers. Country neither benefited by giving them award nor going to loose anything by returning such award by writers. let them get media highlights for few days which they are more interested as now no one is asking them...

                            Dear MSI, over decades of Congress rule, the administration chose to nominate, both to run the Sahithya academy and to receive these awards, people with leftist leanings, rather than picking the best scholars, and in some cases (for example, in Kerala) people who make hundreds of grammatical mistakes when handwriting a simple letter in their local language!!! These people never protested the leftist, divisive tactics of your Government (like cleansing Kashmir of native Pandits), and mostly to suppress the local culture and traditions in favor of a more westernized or sometimes communist views foreign to India. If such people feel betrayed when Bharatiya samskriti is recognized, or if the Government does not follow their leftist leanings, or the British Macaulay's agenda to make Indians shameful of their own culture, so be it.

                            It is a fact that undeserving people got many a awards during Nehru, Indira and Rajiv regime. This is nothing but grabbing headlines. Yes what happened was bad and unfortunate, but this not the first time such a killing has happened and blaming Modi for everything is a reflection of ones knowledge of working of the Govt. Law and Order is a state subject. Mani's own state has many a flaws and many killing happening but you think JJ or Mani will allow Centre to take charge, No. But why here. <br/><br/>
It would be good if these winners also return the money they have received as part of the award. Nature has a reason to clean up undeserving people getting awards, this is one of the way.

                            Writers returning awards and  /or relinquishing position in Sahithya Academy, does Send any message to any one, much less to a PM, elected by majority Indians. From their acts and irrelevant expression of "Intolerance", only show that, they neither scholar nor intellectual and are ONLY below ordinary people, with political affinity.  What these writers, poets  and De &amp; nite activists did, when 4000 sikhs were massacred during Congress regime, for 1 life (or) when  Congress aided to murder 100s of 1000s Tamil origin Sri lankan, women &amp; chilren included, again for 1 life. Most of the awardees are during Congress regime and some are related to Nehru clan. What else one can expect. Its better for an Hindustani to be RSS Pracharak, than GHANDY Pracharak.

                            Wonder when we would see an educated person from the right wing in this country. Education means having the ability to argue their case than calling names. Please realise that to disagree with MSA, accomplished writers need not be run down. Literature has many hues and ideological preferences. It it this variety in perspectives that makes a society civil and hence civilised. Hindutva chanting does not in any way guarantee Hindu superiority. In fact, it may work the other way.

                            If anyone thinks that returning a few awards by writers the majority of Indians have never even heard of let alone read, he or she must be severely disillusioned. MSA finds the perfect platform here to continually spew his nonsense and dislike for anything remotely connected to hindutva. The so-called pluralistic and diverse society does have its extremists on all sides but his objections and criticism is only confined to his religion.

If you think you are truly secular and what not, please also write an article explaining the "secularism" and "democratic values" of Congress during the 1984 riots. Pray tell us what values did congress honor during the Emergency? Do tell us. I condemn what has happened. It is against the values of both India and hinduism. But please do not make a fool of us by delivering rubbish week after week. Please look inwards and atone for you own sins first. Modi bashing may get you in Raga's good books but do not attempt to hide your sins under the garb of secularism,Gandhi-Nehru,democracy and what not.Why not set the record straight? Why not write a article to explain Rajiv Gandhi's statement "when a tree falls, the earth is bound to shake". you are a hypocrite and nothing else.

                            One interesting fact.. Nayantara Sahgal received her award in 1986..two years after the sikh riots. I wonder where her sense of patriotism and  "secular values" were at that time? Couldn't she refuse the award at that time? Mind you what is happening today is wrong and lynching  somebody for eating meat, killing writers is not tolerable. But these pseudo-seculars have no right to criticize the govt.

                            1. German is a secular language but Sanskrit is communal<br/>
2. Reading about Galileo (1564-1642) is secularism but reading about Aryabhata (476-550 AD) is Saffronization<br/>
3. Reciting poems/plays of Shakespeare (1564-1616) is secularism but reciting poems/play of Kalidas (5th centuary AD) is Saffronization<br/>
4. Thinking cow/beef as food is liberalism/modernism but thinking cow as mother is orthodoxy/backwardness<br/>
5. Allelopathy and Homeopathy are real science but Ayurveda is pseudo-science.<br/>
6. Physical Training (known as PT in schools) is secular but Yoga is communal.<br/>
7. Criticizing ideal worship is rationalism but criticizing news channels promoting superstition is extremism.<br/>
8. Minorities means Muslims/Christians, but Jains, Bhudhists, Sikhs, Parsi are just extension of Hinduism hence not considered minorities.<br/>
8. Muslim/Dalit man dying is much more TRP than someone else dying.<br/>
9. Agitators doing vandalism/destroying public property are good people/concerned citizens but cops stopping them/arresting them are cruel, death of democracy.<br/>
10. Media writing articles that are biased, full of lies and defaming others is freedom of speech/journalism but deleting comments of "Smart Citizens" pointing out their bias is moderation or else they are right wing hindu trolls.<br/>
10. Terrorism is not related to religion, hence must not be mentioned but (Hindu) extremism has everything to do with Hinduism/Hindutva, whole community has to be blamed for it.<br/>
11. NGO even if flaunting Indian laws is social cause but Government stopping them is dictatorship.<br/>
12. USA spying on its own citizens specially Muslim neighbourhood is security measure but India asking BBC, Facebook and Google to follow its law is privacy concern.<br/>
13. USA sending lander to Mars is pride movement for Indians but India sending Mangalyaan to Mars is wastage of money. (think about poor)<br/>
14. Commencement of talks between Indian and Pakistan is Pakistan's big heartedness but failure of talks is diplomatic failure for India. It is indian shallowness.<br/>
15. Hanging of terrorist like Yakub or Kasab is front page news, but armymen dying at border is not (Most of the time they are not even named).<br/>
16. VP Hamid Ansari invoking his muslim identity is secularism but PM Modi calling himself hindu is communalism.<br/>
17. Organizer is RSS's mouthpiece but Network 18 (affiliation to Congress), Jaya TV (owned by Jayalalita), other leftist media are real and factual media<br/>
18. Rahul Gandhi crying about his father and grandmother is real, but Modi crying about his mother is drama.<br/>
19 Rahul Gandhi from rich and influential family wearing kurta pajma is pro poor/pro farmer but Modi from poor family wearing suit is pro corporate/anti poor.<br/>
20. Dividing Indians based on Hindu. Muslim, Christian is secularism but talking about one India is communal.<br/>
21. Calling India as India is secular but calling it Bharat Mata is communal.<br/><br/>
call me bhakta u think this is right

                            Prime Minister Narendra modi now appears more as a roadside goon elevated to that post and much less a chaywalla whom the democratic traditions/practices of this country decorated with the PM title.  Why the extempore ideas that he showers on the country (and the international audience?) do not leave have any evidence on the ground will perhaps remain a question!<br/>
While it is now no secret that he and council of ministers have umbilical connection with their parent organisation RSS, what is not known is which minister is attached to which rss pracharak.  Modi and his team are just following the orders they receive from the horse's mouth!  <br/><br/>
It is time that supporters of BJP and modi awaken to grand criticism offered on this great person by Vajpayee And Advani at least, before it is too late.

                            The real problem is that nobody actually knows what Modi's mandate was in the last election. He thinks it is for him+RSS+BJP, but many people expected that Modi, outside the BJP/RSS influence would be the new leader. Modi has never been able to distance himself from the right wingers. He plays the Statemen by remaining silent on important issues and then reverts to his electioneering style when abroad or at his campaigns. The RSS is running wild because they never dreamt of this bonanza

                            You've got to hand it to the secular parties...they've done a brilliant job (with the active and vital support of the media) of stirring up a frenzy and convincing the general populace of the country that this country is under siege from communal forces. I'm guessing in reality the the level of atrocities and outrage (admittedly high) is probably exactly what it has been for several decades in this largely medieval country but the media has suddenly propelled these incidents to the forefront and painted everything with a communal brush....I'm curious as to why the average person on the street doesn't put on his/ her thinking cap and think through a simple point carefully...when there is mass hysteria about communal tension and fear of inter-community hostility, which is the political party that stands to gain most from people's fears? Rather obvious if people care to genuinely think things through....

And at the end of it, Mani sleeps and dreams about the wonderful India he and his Congress friends had built up, which BJP is hell bent on tearing apart.  Mani gets up the next day and wonders again "how can I run down BJP today", and Mani's life goes on.  Mani Shankar, and his last crusades.

Find your true worth before trying to throw weight. As common man of this country, I hardly care for you !! I'm more worried about economic prosperity, alleviating poverty, finding India's true space globally, employment, encouraging youth to deliver innovation and environment for growth.

                            Unfortunately in India we have seen riots and all sorts of wrongdoing. Be it 1984, 2002. We have also seen huge number of deaths in Kashmir. I am sure I am missing many. The point is, lot worse than Dadri happened in our country. I think it is getting lot more attention than it should. The culprits should be booked. The media should also show where communal minority forces are doing wrong. Instead of trying to portray a very bad image of our society, I think media should show the positive side as well. If people started returning their award like this, I think by now they should have done this as we have seen lot worse than Dadri. After a long time we have got a decisive prime minister who is trying to make India a strong and prosperous country. Lets help him. It will be good for all of us.

                            To compare India to Nazi Germany is as ridiculous as comparing Modi to Hitler. Modi starts with a major disadvantage in that he once worked for the RSS. That is a red rag to pseudo secular congressmen like Aiyer. Remember that the people of India voted Modi to power. And decimated the congress. And the people are perfectly aware of what they have done. Therefore no reason for Aiyer to preach about communalism. It was the congress and its leaders like Tytler who massacred Sikhs in 1984. It was the foolish Rajiv Gandhi who opened the locks of the Ayodhya shrine leading to the Babri Masjid demolition. It was the same Rajiv Gandhi who amended the muslim law after the Shah Bano case, impoverishing generations of divorced muslim women so that he could pander to the muslim vote bank. Ask Arif Mohammed Khan who resigned from the cabinet in protest. The quote of Pastor Niemoller is irrelevant and senseless in this context. If Modi had been Hitler do you think Aiyer would be around to do his pathetic mudslinging? He would have just disappeared.

                            Not sure what gulam of Gandhi family thinks about RSS, but he has to go and attend few shaka to have a good understanding of RSS. <br/><br/>
I am in UK, have have attended RSS shaka for over 4 years and I would say I never found anything bad at RSS. We always were taught nationalism, patriotism, and service to the nation and humanity.

                            As someone has said we should wait for a few years and see that Modi takes us on the road to Development. Unfortunately only the blind can believe that things are actually getting better. In the past year our humane and tolerant culture is being systematically torn down by the louts and self appointed protectors of the Hindu religion. Hindu philosophy has survived for several thousands of years despite foreign rule of the Mughals and British. Do these benighted people think that it cannot survive without their crude and despicable actions? It is just hatred and vengeance - the two worst emotions with which to build a nation. Nation building needs trust and tolerance.

                            Mani Shankar's rant is directly proportional to his poisonous mindset and inversely proportional to his educated illiteracy which he is trying to project of being a great chamcha.

                            It does not matter how hard they try to break the peace people will reject this kind of politics. If Modi ji sticks strictly do development, he and his ideas will prevail but if he thinks that with media management ,carrying the RSS secret agenda secretly under the carpet he can escape then he is playing with fire and need to be careful. People of India have never accepted people with hatred. So time for introspection PM sir.

                            Nehru, Gandhi stooge and great sycophant of lutaru family has immensely helped NDA parties by his stupid comments like 'chaiwala'. It is best that he continues to spit out garbage so that it helps NDA. No body takes him seriously even in congress.

                            That is some powerful writing, Mr Aiyer. I too would like the PM to speak out more eloquently against such incidents. As PM of the country issues like jurisdiction/protocol should be treated as secondary when events like this are happening. <br/>
Having said that I would hold state govts to account as well. If they are not willing to strengthen the law and order machinery within their jurisdiction these incidents are bound to keep happening. This requires police reforms, something that no govt, state or centre seems to have a stomach for. Till we have a robust law enforcement lumpen elements whether they be from the right or the left will always have a field day and the political class will have something to shout about on prime time TV debates. One side keeps saying this is a law and order issue the other side insists its a right wing conspiracy to brainwash impressionable minds. <br/>
The media too can do a much better job if it does an in depth investigation and brings out the ground reality instead of harping on a response from the PM.
