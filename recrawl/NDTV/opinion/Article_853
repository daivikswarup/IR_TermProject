Headline::::Where Andhra's Masterplan For New Capital Falters



DateTime::::2015-09-28T19:29:00+05:30




                                As a delegation from Singapore, led by the island-state's Home Minister, S Ishwaran, submitted the master plan for the Amaravati capital city on 20 July 2015 to the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh (AP), N Chandrababu Naidu, computer-simulated images of the new urban mega project, the "dream capital," which looked like those on brochures of mega real estate ventures, appeared prominently in the local media. The master plan prepared by Surbana International Consultants, the urban consultancy firm from Singapore, envisages the new capital city to be "the pioneer Smart City of India" with "world-class standards set forth by countries such as Singapore". The Chief Minister has been promoting this city as a "people's capital" and a "21st century city." It has been argued that such projects win legitimacy through, among others, seductive media images, and are often backed by new forms of coercion.
After the bifurcation of AP into Telangana and a separate AP from 2 June 2014, Hyderabad is the joint capital for up to 10 years, by which time AP should have its own capital city. The Government of India had earlier appointed an expert committee headed by former union urban development secretary K C Sivaramakrishnan to study various alternatives on the new capital for AP. The committee submitted its report in August 2014 after consultations with different stakeholders across AP. Its terms of reference had included, among others, the least dislocation of the existing agriculture systems. The committee cautioned against establishing a greenfield capital and diverting fertile farmland, especially in the Krishna-Guntur region. It recommended decentralised development and a smaller capital where government land was available.New Capital and Capital Region
Disregarding the recommendations of this committee, the AP government decided to locate the capital city in highly fertile, multi-cropped land in an area spread over 25 villages and four hamlets in Tullur, Tadepally and Mangalagiri mandals in Guntur District on the right bank of the Krishna river. There was no social or environment impact assessment study. Nor was there any public debate or consultation, despite claims that the government held detailed consultations with urban development experts and various public organisations before deciding on the location of the capital city.
The AP Capital Region Development Authority Act was brought into effect on 30 December 2014 and it selected the Vijayawada-Guntur-Tenali-Mangalagiri (VGTM) area as the capital region. The Land Pooling Scheme (LPS) Rules were issued on 1 January 2015. The new capital city was named Amaravati in April 2015. One of the major issues for those in the present AP state who opposed bifurcation was their association with Hyderabad and the perceived loss of opportunities this represented. Ever since assuming power, the AP Chief Minister has been feeding this sentiment and pledging that he will build a "world class" city that matches or even surpasses Hyderabad.
The government has aggressively pursued land pooling by a series of measures that include generating compliance by offering residential/commercial plots; heavy reliance on land speculation, coercion, blackmail and intimidation; and projecting the involvement of foreign governments through what the local people call "mind games" for taking over agricultural land. This so-called voluntary land pooling has mainly benefited large landowners. The Land Ordinance repeatedly promulgated by the Government of India from January 2015 onwards has immensely helped the AP government in intimidating farmers. In this "mind game", the government exhibited a "rhetoric of urgency" to "justify the speeding up of law-making, regulations and policies to enable a new city to quickly materialise". The relevant act was passed and rules issued in less than three days, they were not made available in the local language, and deadlines were set with short time limits to pressurise farmers for speedy surrender of land before the implications were understood. Making the Singapore team submit a master plan in May 2015 and performing a bhumi puja (groundbreaking ceremony) on 6 June 2015 (although the foundation stone is to be laid only on 22 October 2015) were also aimed at pressurising farmers. Of the land taken so far, about 40% is known as jareebu (wet) land, which is adjacent to the Krishna River on the right. Considered some of the best land in the country, with water tables at 15 to 20 feet, about 120 varieties of crops are now cultivated round the year on this land.
According to the master plan, phase I requires 37,758 acres for a 10-year period up to 2025. The state government claims that 30,000 acres of land have already been pooled under the land-pooling arrangements.A Speculative City?
Analysing Bangalore's "speculative urbanism," Goldman argues that world-city projects "not only represent large-scale place-altering capital infusions" from outside, but also play a role in "restructuring of governance institutions for improved access to public goods and services for international capital" (2011). In AP, the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) is given "absolute power to acquire, sell, transfer, grant license or alienate the land" for the purpose of development or redevelopment. A glance through the draft master plan, especially its careful projection of images, nomenclature of key areas, projection of job creation and population increase, and the backdrop of huge real estate speculation would easily enable classifying Amaravati as a speculative city. The planners from Surbarna also seem to have mastered vastu principles and provided an axis to channel the positive energy from the Kanakadurga temple across the Krishna, and also followed the Vedic principle of having a Brahmastan (Silent Centre) - a central open space in two decentralised modular towns. The master plan is envisaged in three phases up to 2050, which requires a total of about 1,00,000 acres (about 40,000 hectares) of land until 2050, revealing the need to further take over about 70,000 acres of multi-cropped land in coming years.
While Amaravati is envisaged to be built in an area of 217 square kilometres, the master plan covers 391.63 sq km for the long-term period up to 2050. The capital region will be 7,420 sq km. The "Seed" (this acronym is not expanded in the plan) development area will be the core city in about 17 sq km. The master plan adopts four key "place making strategies" for Amaravati - Gateway, Downtown, Government Core and Water Front. The Gateway will "create the first impression" while entering the city. Downtown will be the commercial heart, the Government Core will house the seat of the state government, and the Water Front will have "an iconic image and skyline." The Business District of the new city is expected to house "large corporate houses, the headquarters of banking and financial institutions," with a "corporate hub" and a "financial hub." There will also be a "knowledge hub," and a "tourism/heritage/leisure hub," along with the usual cultural centres, transport infrastructure, and so on of the like which one comes across in city master plans. All these are expected to make Amaravati a mega city.
The master plan proposes to distribute the 4.5 million people who will inhabit Amaravati by 2050 into 18 self-sustainable townships through integration of land use and transport planning. What is envisioned appears to be a highly regulated (and controlled?) city. Can such a city accommodate the urban informal sector and the poor/low-income people who migrate to the city in search of livelihood opportunities? Will Amaravati become a private city - planned, built (and even administered) by private/foreign companies/governments? The Concept Note on Smart Cities by the Government of India specifies that most of the infrastructure in smart cities will be taken up "either as complete private investment or through PPPs" (public-private partnerships). The private sector and foreign capital may take part in a big way in building and maintaining Amaravati. Incidentally, the expert committee includes the chief town planner of Lavasa Corporation of Maharashtra. The Lavasa paradigm of "future cities" may be accountable to only its stockholders and investors, and seems to be inspired by totalitarian city states such as Singapore and Dubai.Speculative Projections
Where the master plan falters heavily is in its projection of huge employment generation, population increase and demand for land in the new city in the next 10-20 years. While the employment projection appears to be over-ambitious, the population projections are very inconsistent with demographic trends in the region.
The Amaravati capital city area now has a population of 0.27 million. The current population of the CRDA region is about 5.81 million, and about half of this lives in urban centres. Surbana Consultants have estimated this to reach 10.1 million in the next 20 years. With the CRDA region divided into eight planning regions, the population is estimated to increase by 90%, with high growth projected in the central region (141.37%) in which Amaravati and Vijayawada are located. Even planning regions that are largely rural are also estimated to grow by about 69% to 86%. Given this, the only way to reach such population figures is a massive influx of people from outside. Can that happen? And is the centre being planned to accommodate such an influx, especially of low-income earners?
The draft master plan admits that the current share of AP in information technology (IT) exports, sans Hyderabad, is about 0.4% in India, and that the AP government seeks to raise this share to 5% by 2020. It may be worth noting that Visakhapatnam, which has a population of close to 2 million, is the only major city in AP that has good infrastructure and is on the coast. Employment in the IT sector in this city is still about 17,000 or so. If the choice were to be outside Hyderabad, it is highly unlikely that IT companies would prefer Amaravati to Visakhapatnam. In the draft submitted in March 2015, the Singapore-based consultants have considered the "growth rates achieved by key capital cities such as Bengaluru and Hyderabad taking into consideration the significant economic growth anticipated" in the capital region in the next 20 years. It is unthinkable that this yet-to-emerge city will generate employment opportunities comparable to the two existing megacities.
It is worth noting that by the time the IT sector appeared on the scene, in 1991, the Hyderabad Urban Agglomeration (HUA), spread over 778 sq km, already had huge industrial, scientific and educational sectors, and a population of 4.36 million. This went up to 5.72 million in 2001 and 7.75 million in 2011. Hyderabad attracted migrants from across undivided AP and the rest of India. To assume that Amaravati as a capital will attract 4 million migrants in the next 20 years is beyond belief.
Who will bring so many companies to Amaravati to create employment, and why? A view that the Singapore government has taken on the responsibility of bringing in companies from abroad is being propagated to show that it is just a matter of time before big companies begin descending on Amaravati. This view has also gained ground because of apprehensions that the land taken from farmers and other agencies may ultimately end up in the hands of foreign companies after the Capital City Development and Management Company (CCDMC) is set up with the power to allot land on 99-year leases to joint ventures or private parties in Amaravati.
Even at the ground level, local geographical conditions seem to pose several challenges to the building of this city. The master plan admits that a large amount of the Amaravati capital city land falls in a "medium to low flood risk zone" and talks of designing an extensive "water-networked city." Is it that simple? It seems that about 10,000 acres of land will have to be raised by 2 metres at an estimated cost of about Rs. 1,500 crore to protect Amaravati from floods in the Krishna River and Kondaveeti Vaagu, a rivulet. Building high rises on a river flood plain is a costly affair because of additional foundation and water-proofing requirements. The opposite bank being hilly and already developed, one would expect a high water table on this side. As the location is just upstream of the Prakasam Barrage, the rise of pollutants in the water is a possibility. Gradually, as the new city grows, urban flooding may become a reality, especially when the river is swollen, as architect Shankar Narayan points out. It has also been reported that the "Singapore government or the private consultants did not conduct any technical studies except for some field visits that lasted a few hours. Baseline studies to collect critical parameters were not carried out". That the CRDA is now planning to conduct soil tests in the Seed Capital area for suitability to build skyscrapers confirms this view.Conclusions
The Singapore companies working on the master plan seem to be seeking 3,000 acres of land in the capital region. In view of this, the Chief Minister's claim that they are providing a free service is highly suspect as the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed with Singapore is not available in the public domain. (It looks like it has not been provided even under the Right to Information Act.) The issue is now before the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The CRDA commissioner claimed in his counter affidavit that most of the land in the capital area are dry lands according to the revenue records of 1908.8 It is quite ironical that a chief minister and a government that showcase the benefits of IT and e-governance in day-to-day life have no qualms in blatantly trying to mislead the NGT by citing records that are more than a century old.
Finally, one is tempted to comment that the draft master plan documents (at www.crda.ap.gov.in) leave much to be desired in terms of readability. The font is very small and the colour combination dull; many boxes and the map indexes become unreadable on enlarging. This gives rise to a legitimate feeling that this could be a deliberate ploy to serve two purposes - to show that the government is transparent and the documents have been shared with the public; and, more important, at the same time ensure that few should be able to read them, let alone understand them.(C Ramachandraiah is at the Centre for Economic and Social Studies, Hyderabad)

                            Sorry sir you will soon be branded as congress stooge. Anyone who speaks bitter truth will be either be called a congress stooge or an anti-national. I have a feeling that all that will happen in the name of new capital is a large scale looting across party lines in Andhra. Everyone will be paid to keep quite and get a share. They will make a lot of noise but actually whats going on is a conspiracy of silence. A few people like you might try to make some sense but will be lost in the noise that goes around. Good luck India. Its testing time foe this country. Next couple of decades is a make or break for Indian democracy.

                            Hopefully TDP Govt and Mr Naidu will realize their folly and withdraw and scale down their Capital City plans. They should realize that sticking to fundamental principles of Good Governance and Long term organic growth plan will work better than imposing an Alien looking behemoth in the name of "out-doing" Hyderabad. Equitable growth and minimum disruption of People's livelihoods should form the underlying principles of the new Capital, rather than a rat race with Hyderabad, Bengaluru or Chennai.

                            Among the current chief ministers in India, only Chandrbabu Naidu can deliver development. He was the one who put  Hyderabad on the global map. today, the infrastructure of Hyderabad is the best in India. Naidu's good work was followed by Rajasekar  as the CM, who succeed him. The way Babu  is aggressively wooing industries to set up shop in AP needs to be seen, to be believed. India needs more Chandrababus and less of such authors......

                            More than 80% of the farmers volunteered to give their land. According to the current law that is more than sufficient to acquire the rest of the land.   Also, please mention how were the farmers compensated. Please don't write a one sided article, just lay down the facts and let people decide about your writing.

                            One is bound to agree with author on various flaws in this plan by CBN. CBN may be day-dreaming but he had no option left but sell this dream to Andhras. Imagine the mood of people after, worse than mega cyclone, devastating division of the state. 5 cr people were not given any idea of what would their capital be. Instead they were asked to run the capital on rent. Till y'day they had connection with huge international city and overnight they became tenants and lost basic rights to education and employment opportunities. <br/>
With a few buildings as among dusty and congested streets as capital, and Hyderabad jut 200 km away, AP can never attract any investment. Means Andhras should live on agriculture and do not think of any other development. <br/>
Even AP agriculture facing danger from neighbors. Much talked fertile multi-crop land may become arid thanks to aggressive upper states Karnataka and Telangana. <br/>
So what author wants is AP spend huge amounts, which they do not have anyway, on welfare educate its kids. These kids will join MNC in Hyderabad and Bangalore creating economy and taxes in those cities and states. While AP rots away in arid lands.

                            An article spiced with numbers and colored glass analysis seems to suggest that the author did his best - but not without some bias. The author completely ignored the realpolitik. Real life seldom goes by the golden rules of the book sir! The division of the State itself was a proof. Yes it is fertile land. But Andhras are forced to do that in the first place. <br/><br/>
If the capital is placed in a North Andhra region, Rayalaseema will call it inaccessible and if a Rayalaseema region is made capital, who knows, another division of the State could be a possibility, besides a capital in barren land, though cheap and easy to build will be a hell to the inhabitants as HYD has now become with water problems. <br/><br/>
As for belittling new investments and population pressure on the new capital, could anyone guess the metamorphosis of HYD in the 80s. <br/><br/>
Yes, some figures do sound too optimistic, but big dreams start with unbelievable scenarios only. <br/><br/>
Finally as for the author's "small font" complaint in the Master Plan document; I am quite comfortable reading the document. Anyone can check it for themselves.

                            @Ramachandraiah.. your article is full of flaws and it will serve your motive with the people of other regions who don't know the facts. I'm  from CRDA area.Below is my point of view.<br/>
 Except villages along the border of Krishna river, all those "palems".. Thallayapalem, venkatapalem, krishnaypalem, borupalem, uddandaarayunipalem and few more villages which have 10,000 acres rest of the land in other villages depend on rain water. Even though they got river near by some villages have salt water, some villages rejected irrigation canals when AP govt asked if they need water, reason being they want to cultivate Virginia tobacco which will get degraded if the fields get excess water. So they are rainfall dependent villages. So your statement of multi crop land is not true.<br/>
Regarding population growth estimate it was done scientifically where people like you think it is insane. Atlanta airport was built thinking of 150 years of growth. So nothing wrong in those estimates.<br/>
Regarding sivaramakrishnan committee.... who are they to decide our capital? you think we are going to agree if some IAS officers coming from Delhi and no one belonging to AP represent that committee decides our capital? CBN throwed that in the trash and declared the capital.<br/>
Why not Amaravathi the place between Guntur and Vijayawada and is the center of AP don't fit as a capital? I can tell you 100 reasons why only that area has the right to be the capital. Rayalaseema people has a history of spearheading separate state movement, Uttarandhra comprising Vizag has a similar history and even today these guys threaten to going out of AP. The only region which never asked for a separate state is the coastal Andhra comprising Godavaris, Krishna and Guntur. So just in case in future if Rayalaseema wants to leave AP they are good to go and similarly with Uttarandhra so that we will not be in a similar situation where we lost capital twice.<br/>
regarding poor people staying in Amaravathi? They don't have to. Can a poor person stay in Beach candy area or Juhu beach of Mumbai, Adayar of Chennai, Jubiliee Hills of Hyd or Jayanagar of Bangalore? So no worries everyone has their place. There are lot of places for every group in Guntur, Vijayawada outskirts or near by villages and there will be excellent transportation to commute to work in downtown Amaravathi. So no worries.<br/><br/>
The only motive you have is you don't want Amaravathi to be built in Vijayawada-Guntur area coz people over there have guts, they are enterprising, they got money, education, vision, hard working nature and more than all these they dream to make their dreams come true. you don't want that to happen. So you want Amaravathi to be built in Donakonda or some other remote place where there will not be any growth. If you are not from Andhra then please mind your business and keep quite for the next 10 years and then you can come to Amaravathi through Vijayawada International Airport or Amaravathi Turnpike expressway (passing through the green fields unlike your telangana barren land) or through waterways on Buckhinghum canal or on cruise lines to Bundar or VANPIC or Suryalanka beaches.

                            One way govt spending billions on irrigation projects to create fertile lands, another hand destroying the same land in the name of capital. Still 70% of AP lands don't have proper irrigation facilities. Who is stopping them to build capital on such lands. One CBN travelling to Silicon Valley to attract Inaidan IT people to new capital and another way travelling to Sigapore and begging them to build the capital. Did he not believe IIT people to do the job. Gopi

                            There is no law as per crda. Non volunteered people were told they will acquire land through land acquisition. This is called playing mind games on pooling. Large tracks of agriculture land to a capital city. Only future will tell the benefits and drawbacks by this kind of ambitious projects. By that time many people who envisaged these ideas will be gone and future generation will see the real benefits and big pit falls of these strategies. It's very clear only politicians and few higher ups in a connected society benefit from this. Because these personalities think that they can buy anything.

                            It is funny that, Naidu and his supporters who call him tech savvy and IT pioneer CM give the reason of capital staying at the center of all regions. In this communication age and this Cm who is known for his tech use like video conferences etc talk about distance. The plain truth is that Naidu and his party which is supported and dominated by a particular caste people want the benefit and development in a region where they are majority. Naidu and these people are also thinking that building a capital will solve all issues and bring growth.  Naidu is certainly a better CM compared to other leaders but he is bound by his caste group.  he forgot that despite his so called development and IT growth people kicked him and his party out of power and kept him away for 10 years. Building a capital city may help 20% of the population but remaining 80% will be far away from development and they will kick him out. It is strange that many of his supporters who are NRI's from US blindlty ignore the fact that 90% of capital cities of states in US are not major cities.  They are smaller cities which are center of administration. Naidu could planned a smaller capital city and used the funds to develop the other 32 regions like seema and north-east region which are very backward. Now these will stay backward and the andhra region which is already well off with fertile lands and water availability will benefit more.

                            For nearly 700 years since the fall of Pratapa rudra, Telanganas were ruled by foreigners including Andhras who they call as settlers. They did not participate in any kind of growth and development by rulers. It is no surprise this author does not understand how the development happens. They were happy with Irani chai, hated Idli Sambar. But by stroke of luck Italian waitress served them Hyderabad. This author cannot understand how their own Hyderabad developed since Shahis till Andhras. Coz they cannot differentiate between "doing" and "happening". Since they do not know how to do, they think it cannot happen. It is good for these people to understand their "boast but do nothing" CM instead of worrying about Andhra capital. If they are really so much concerned by people of AP, they must first answer why Andhras forced out of Hyderabad.

                            Kudos to Mr Ramachandraiah for his objective analysis.The author should have touched upon on environment,sustainability and biodiversity a little more but that doesn't take away any sheen out of what he is trying to convey. The part of the problem in hyping up the discussion stems up from 'deprivation and depression',politicians are cashing it and stoking the flares. Deprivation and depression take their root in unabashed bifurcation,people from Andhra believe that without Hyderabad and its Ring roads,metros,airport,IT parks they lost their 'everything'. An average Andhraite believes that Hyderabad is developed because of the icing -Ring roads,metro etc and any 'Andhra' city with these bells and whistles can stand as an alternative to Hyderabad.It is exactly at this point our beloved leaders from the ruling party are flaring up the passions to keep the irrational beliefs alive.Development of cities ,as witnessed in history, has taken place by sheer accidents,of connivance of geography,sociology,politics and history and not by plans.

                            @ Ravi Kumar, Castism is a common problem for the entire country not just limited to Vijayawada or Guntur. Is there no castism in Vizag? are there no caste fights in Vizag between Gavaras vs Koppu velamas vs Toorpu kapus vs Kalingas? Take a break. <br/><br/>
Why did central govt put al industries in Vizag? Is there no other place in the entire coast of AP other than Vizag? don't say vizag is a natural harbor. Britishers thought Bandar is a great seaport when they entered Andhra. Krishnapatnam is a great seaport and it has been proved now. Dugarajapatnam and Ramayapatnam are equally good and Central govt are planning to build seaports and ship building yards in one of those two seaports, why did Vizag got the first preference by central govt to build a seaport? Why did Vizag got steel plant? is there iron ore mines there? NO. Why did't they select a place in Ananthapur district where there are huge iron ore mines ? <br/><br/>
So please don't create new problems with your regional bias. Think in a broader perspective.<br/><br/>
One more thing about Railway zone. How can a railway zone be in a corner of that zone? Let's say if a Railway field officer wants to check something in Guntakal. how convenient is that for him to travel from Vizag? instead of Vijayawada/Guntur. I would say even for railway zone Vizag is not a good fit. It is better to have that in Amaravathi.<br/><br/>
I can strongly say that CBN is trying his best to develop the state and is also spreading the development across the state. Check the institutions in every district starting from Srikakulam's Tribal university to Ananthapur's central university, every district has something, may be some has more than one. But it doesn't matter we are all one state. Ofcourse we need a Capital and that too we were sent out twice in a humiliating manner. So we need to have that instinct to build a world class capital and we need to strive for that or else we will be seen as losers. This time we are not going to loose and in the next 10 years we will have a bustling capital. Just wait.

                            Only employment that is possible in lieu of the new capital is begging and stealing. Remember the super cyclone that cleared vast tracts of coconut plantation in Kona Seema. Many people lost their means of earning daily bread and turned to begging. Obviously people with less patience and higher ego turned to stealing. Chain of chain snatching started already.
