Headline::::Vajpayee Would Not Approve



DateTime::::2014-12-29T14:21:00+05:30



(MK Venu is Executive Editor of Amar Ujala publications group)It is ironical that the BJP was celebrating Good Governance Day on December 25 in the midst of news that the government would resort to the ordinance route to pass important economic legislation. Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee would certainly not have approved. The new insurance bill and coal mining legislation were done via ordinance. Now the government is proposing changes in the land acquisition law through the ordinance route. There may be more ordinances, for all you know. The narrow-focused business community may be applauding Modi's devotion to economic reforms, but all this does not augur well for our parliamentary democracy. No one expected that the relationship between the ruling party and the opposition would deteriorate so early in the life of this Lok Sabha. This is very serious and will have profound implications for governance in the coming years. Modi will have to take a lot of responsibility for this early deterioration of ties with the opposition.      The BJP argues that the opposition is blocking the legislative agenda in Rajya Sabha, where the ruling party is well below the halfway mark. The opposition has hit back saying the BJP's mentor,  the RSS, and  several associated outfits have vitiated the political climate through a well-planned "ghar vapsi" campaign aimed at reconverting Christians, Muslims and other minorities to Hinduism. Many media commentators, who have been staunch supporters of Modi, are deeply puzzled at the behavior of the RSS which organisationally helped put Modi in the seat of power which he occupies today. Many of them have begun expressing doubts about Modi's ability to create a conducive environment in the country so that critical issues of development could be addressed. No wonder there are newsreports suggesting that Modi has asked for newspaper clippings of negative articles on him and his government, of late.Modi badly needs broad-based political buy-in to carry out developmental reforms. The BJP's calculation that it can cynically resort to the ordinance route until it gets a majority in Rajya Sabha by the end of 2016 is totally flawed. Politics doesn't work purely on numbers. How quickly Rajiv Gandhi frittered away the goodwill that resulted in 414 seats in Lok Sabha is still fresh in our collective memory.  It is the job of the Prime Minister to establish a rapport with opposition leaders, inspite of all the differences, and take the common agenda forward. On this score, Modi seems to be losing the plot. Modi's government and his party must become aware of the kind of hubris that is now on display because of the ruling formation's conduct at various levels. Atal Bihari Vajpayee would certainly have stooped to conquer had he confronted a situation in Parliament requiring him to make a statement on the RSS's campaign on conversion, or on the BJP MP's statement that Gandhi's assassin was a patriot.Vajpayee had a way with words and he was endowed with long-standing personal relationships. Ashok Tandon, who served as the Prime Minister's media advisor from 1999 to 2004, once told me that the Prime Minister would often get a call from the West Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu and they would talk for an hour on all kinds of issues. Vajpayee would tell all his officials to leave the room because the conversation was never strictly official. There was a personal rapport that Vajpayee enjoyed with ideological rivals. After naming Vajpayee a Bharat Ratna, Modi might do well to learn some of the political attributes of the former Prime Minister.It was not as if the Sangh Parivar did not pressure Vajpayee from time to time. The Parivar hated the guts of the all-powerful Principal Secretary Brajesh Mishra. He was Vajpayee's eyes and ears and he tried to keep Sangh's agenda at bay as much as was possible in such a complex arrangement.Crucially, Vajpayee managed to have a conversation with opposition leaders at all times. So much that everyone would speculate whether Vajpayee had a secret understanding with Sonia Gandhi on various matters. That era is clearly over as the new BJP under Modi has clearly decided that a political battle with a residual Congress of 44 Lok Sabha seats is not over. Modi bhakts, within and outside the party, want the "dynasts decimated."Modi's trusted party president Amit Shah goes about threatening to uproot regional leaders who have won big victories in the Lok Sabha polls in their respective states. These leaders perceive that the seven-month-old union government is bent upon letting the CBI loose on them. Mamata Banerjee, whom Amit Shah accused of helping fund terror in West Bengal, is now devoting maximum energy on mobilizing a united political front against the NDA government. Uncharacteristically, even Navin Patnaik has come out in the open, charging the BJP with attempting to destabilize his government in Orissa. Mind you, Patnaik had won the most stunning victory both in the Lok Sabha and assembly polls which were held simultaneously. Even as the CBI goes about questioning Navin's close political associates, Shah's men are ostensibly negotiating with BJD MPs to see whether they would be tempted to create a schism in their party. This has prompted Navin Patnaik, regarded as a clean leader by consensus, to publicly protest against such tactics. Also note the irresponsible manner in which the Assam Chief Minister is being charged with harbouring ISI agents. The moment you say ISI agent, an underlying communal messaging becomes clear. The real puzzle is why is all this happening in the very first seven months of Modi's rule when he is supposed to focus just on the developmental agenda. Normally such aggressive political play occurs towards the end of a Lok Sabha tenure.     There seems to be a larger design to ensure that at the end of this project of confrontational politics, the only "clean politician" India will have is Narendra Modi. But such a project is certainly not going to get parliament working smoothly. And more crucially, it will irreparably vitiate the country's political climate.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            After 60 yrs we have a man pushing development. How long can he wait for Sabhas to approve legislations? I think an ordinance is needed to dismiss members who stall parliament as if this ruckus is reflective of our democratic values. Venu - educate yourself - dictatorships like china, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore are also far ahead of us. We need 12-15% GDP growth for 8 out of next 20 years and atleast 7-9% for remaining 12 years to come out of poverty. Clean, unclean is not relevant here. Corruption is not a threat, socialism and communism is. Our country is exceptionally backward and poor and yet we boast of a democracy. This excessive democracy which is no better than "reservation", "minority" and "women's rights" mobocracy has not at all worked - go around in south east asia, europe , US and may be even place like Thailand and Indonesia to experience yourself. We need to rethink the entire system, that kept us so poor for years and modi is centralizing power to correct this - see results for yourself in Gujarat. Can you provide solutions yourself apart from procedure based open mouthed criticism of Modi that supports stalling of parliament?

                            The Rajya Sabha is composed of a bunch of NON-elected persons. They are nominated in an honorary capacity by the then ruling parties - Eg.s are Tendulkar, Rekha, Vijay Mallya etc. When such a group is hell-bent on obstructionism and intent on not allowing important matters to be tabled then the Govt. is CORRECT to use the ordinance route. The Government has been elected to look after the big picture. A few dozen tribals being "converted" cannot take precedence over legislature which will impact the future of Hundreds of millions of ppl. In any case- On what basis have the Rajya Sabha members taken on themselves the role of self-appointed guardians in such matters. As Amit Shah has repeatedly said- A simply solution is to pass legislature against forced conversion. This they will not do- but will willfully indulge in childish obstructionism on critical issues?

                            No doubt...even Vajayeeji would have opposed or not approved to give 'Bharat Ratna' - highest civilian award to own party member just because he served party lot and remain country's one of the most respected politicians. <br/><br/>
Criteria or reason given to 'Bharat Ratna' to Vajpayeeji - many politicians falls by that merit. Vajpayeeji would have gone actual merit than party favor.

                            It is amazing to see how much hatred and aversion the so called intellectual and political class has against Narendra Modi as person first and then as a Prime Minister of India.<br/>
The overwhelming majority of this section of so called important individuals of our country first want to keep 2002 alive at any cost whether relevant or not does not matter.<br/>
Second all of them want Modi to reply, respond, apologise, clarify and do everything as they want to suit their objectives as if he is there tissue paper.<br/>
Thirdly some intellectuals are actually suggesting that rest of the political class who had taken the nation to doldrums over the decades have all the right to sleep and flirt with notorious and narrow minded parties and individuals as that is what democracy is all about so what that they do all the nasty things but with consensus and in a very gentle and civilised way giving more than enough opportunity to harvest mullah to many individuals who made many from no where.<br/>
And fourth is Modi should be blamed for all the conversions happening and lose talks taking place and also everything that RSS, VHP and other right wing fringe organisation does. Why is silent on this?<br/>
We the citizen of this country has given mandate during the last lok sabha election and we have in majority made BJP to rule based on our faith and belief on Narendra Modi.<br/>
There was no else who could have competed with him as all the opposition were so damn exposed and worthless.<br/>
Ever since he has taken up the responsibility he is making all the right efforts and working over time.<br/>
Is this what bothering many I guess so.<br/>
PM is not the oppositions orderly to obey their dictats in the upper and lower house just to help them to remain relevant.<br/>
For issues on Home, defence, finance, industry and rest of the ministries there is a minister and they can take questions on subjects that relates to their domain.<br/>
Surpassing them and demanding PM to address such issues in the name of parliamentary democracy is all farce and an activity of vested interest.<br/>
Today the aversion of INC towards Modi is pathological and they have been reduced to dust and keep getting, Left parties are the most blessed parties who do not win sits neither have any responsibility nor they are bothered to govern any state as long as they are paid for their byte for criticism and invited to high profile pseudo social gatherings they remain benign to anyone and rest of the opposition is so entrenched in their own mess that beside some ridiculous infantile demands they do not have anything else to do.<br/>
So if the above is to be considered as happening then obviously Mr. Narendra Modi the most observed PM across the world becomes a sitting duck to all such nonsense.<br/>
We have to tolerate such irritants till our PM genuinely make some errors.<br/>
However PM should also take cover from some of his party and organisation members who are also as bad or even worse than many in the opposition.<br/>
Good luck to him and to us.

                            Author has striked the right chord. Modi doenot have the long parliament experience like vajpayee. taking the entire nation together across the party lines was vajpayee style. during 1991 to 1995 vajpayee represented India internationally in many forums and was asked to represent India by a congress government. <br/>
such rapo is required even today . mixing religion with governance would be most dangerous bet which this government is taking . they should not forget that same people who appreciated vajpayee didnot give him a second chance despite bjp india shinning slogan.<br/>
modi should learn from the past and work on aspects like job creation, improved productivity and governance promises he made. thanks to the internatinal oil prices which have come down not because of modi has help him to tackle inflation but how long he can maintain his great image without taking any concrete steps for the betterment of the country.

                            Dear Mr. Venu,<br/><br/>
What needs to be understood here is that Vajpayee was a national leader for many years before he became the prime minister. Hence he could develop a good rapport with the opposition. Unfortunately in Modi's case the opposition is very unsympathetic to his rise from a state leader to prime minister's position. Many MP's in opposition feel that he does not deserve the position and hence have developed an animosity towards him built on jealousy. They do not appear to show him any respect and that is bringing out a negative reaction from many in BJP as well. You could also argue that Modi is fighting a similar battle within BJP as well. It would be good to give him some time and basically some respect for what he has become. People have great expectations from him as they do not see any other credible leader at national level. He will need time to establish some reputation at national level. If ordinance is the route to get the important laws passed, so be it. <br/>
Yes, confrontational politics from BJP is not good and should be avoided. But opposition cannot block the development of the country because a few hundred non-hindus decided to reconvert. That attitude needs to be condemned as well.

                            Rajya Sabha members are trying to stop the functioning of a democratic elected government.  it is not appropriate.  I am sure this kind of behaviour by RajyaSabha members will surely create a undesirable situation in this country going forward. Most of the members sitting in the Rajyasabha are ending there period in next few months. <br/>
Instead of debating on the issues. The members are more intrested in shouting and raising slogans and walkout. <br/>
Be it any party in the center or opposition. they should work together for the nation. you have every right to fight till election. then both have obligations to work for the society.

Any layman , who sees te united opposition protesting against the government in Parliament, will have no difficuly in understanding that this is nothing other than "opposing for the sake of opposing". And one more thing.Did I just hear you saying that CBI is being used against BJD in Odisha :) ? You have to be in Odisha to understand the ground reality a bit better.I also think you need to do a bit more research, before criticizing the governement.

                            Obviously Modi has to beware of these matters if he really wants focus on development. Good decisions should be backed by oppositions as well. As we can say ruling party needs to learn how to rule righteously and opposition needs learn how to be in opposition. It shvould not be tit-for-tat.

                            1. Vajapayee was different from Modi. There is no point in expecting him to become one.<br/>
2. Obstruction of Parliament even when BJP did was not appreciated. It would not have brought them to power, it would have led to hung Parliament. It is Modi and his novelty that brought BJP to power.<br/>
3. If UK and US Parliaments can function in an orderly manner, why our houses can not function. Speakers should deploy their authority. Disorderly Parliament gives a message to nation at large that indiscipline and chaos is OK.<br/>
4. Once indiscipline to force one's view-point is allowed, next logical stage becomes violence.<br/>
5. Even if Modi had made a statement, it would only have been a beginning for Opposition to draw more blood. They still would not have let the house function.<br/>
6. Opposition is standing on quick-sand. They take different stands depending on whether Hindus are involved or minorities are involved for the same issue. Nor do they agree for laws that block all conversion.

                            Your concerns are correct. The consequences of multi party coalition had led our country to most corrupt and undeveloped country despite having all abilities. Lets try only for 5-10 years to work under one leadership so the country can rise and employment can be created. Take example of any country in the world.

                            It is very simple Mr Venu. Ordinance is the way to go if a bunch of self serving fools trying to stall IMPORTANT BILLS.<br/>
  You talk of taking opposition along. You well know that these SO CALLED OPPOSITION would rather demerit/stall the IMPORTANT BILLS on the basis of other political issues rather than actually carry out a meaningful debate which is very rare amongst Indian political flora &amp; fauna.<br/><br/>
By comparing the whole scenario with "What Mr Vajpayee would have done" is nothing but playing politics. <br/><br/>
Please leave Mr Patnaik out of this whole porridge that you're trying to create.<br/><br/>
  And NO, accusing ISI does not make it communal. There is a first I have heard. So, in a way you are telling us that we should be careful of accusing ISI (for whatever reason whether right or wrong) because we become communal by doing so. You must be seriously out of your mind.

We are having the Govt at the centre with absolute majority, with most state elections won by them, therefore unnecessary consensus is unwanted, speaks of people having lower confidence index.<br/><br/>
Moreover, we have more urgent aspects for decision making and ultimately Govt is answerable to the aspirations of common people like us who are sick and tired of hearing that India is a poverty stricken nation

                            With coal linkages to power plants under disarray ever since the Supreme Court ruling, it should have been the joint effort of all elected and nominated members of parliament to find a quick solution to ensure electric supply to all during the next summer through advance planning. <br/><br/>
However, in spite of the public's support to a new government through the last Lok Sabah poll, the members of parliament seem to be still trying to play their petty games. When will they ever true for their country?

                            "Parliamentary democracy"? What are you talking about? When we have Lok Sabha with elected representatives from across the counrty who have been elected by the public directly, why should we have Rajya Sabha, where we get nominated representatives? What kind of people are getting nominated and are they really attending the parliament regularly? For most of them, it's of least priority. Not sure why we need nominated representatives when people across the country vote for the representatives that they want.

                            Why not Ordinance rule, we don't want another Congress like regime, message is clear either allow the parliament to function and pass reforms or do it using Ordinance way<br/><br/>
we don't need Venu's authorization for India to move forward. India has already is 67 years old now and cannot wait another century for Politicians to understand the public mood

                            We thought Congress was arrogant. The media too. In 6 months BJP has more attitude than waht congress gained in 60 years in power. Not to forget that 2 out of 3 people did not vote for BJP.

                            the Editors and anchors have started thinking that they are the masters of this universe and they will decided everything; Venu is no exceptions; these jurnos are equally responsible for India's poor performance in last 10 years

                            Money-muscle power is the old enemy of this democracy. We must bring political parties under RTI to make systems more transparent.
