Headline::::BJP's Co-Opting of Kiran Bedi Isn't Going to Plan



DateTime::::2015-02-02T03:32:00+05:30



Mukul Kesavan is a writer based in Delhi. His most recent book is 'Homeless on Google Earth' (Permanent Black, 2013).
	The Delhi elections should be an annual event, like the Jaipur Festival. They're fun, they're free (well, the voting is) and they perk the city up, they make this sprawling, surly dust bowl coherent. Strangers approach without uttering menaces, they are enthusiastic and sociable, and everywhere people gather purposefully without making other people afraid. It takes an election to make dilliwallahs urban.
	This wasn't always the case. Before Delhi acquired a Vidhan Sabha in 1991, its politics was drearily municipal, almost entirely overshadowed by its status as the Union's capital. Even its municipal politics was fragmented, divided as it was into three urban bodies: the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the New Delhi Municipal Council and the Delhi Cantonment Board. Its politicians, both from the Jan Sangh (later the Bharatiya Janata Party) and the Congress, were resolutely parochial figures, machine politicians who mattered to no one beyond their constituencies.
	In my childhood, Delhi's politics was dominated by the Jan Sangh. Madan Lal Khurana, Vijay Kumar Malhotra and Kedarnath Sahani made this city of small shopkeepers a bastion of majoritarian politics. Flawed though the leaders of the Jan Sangh might have been, they seemed positively genteel compared to the gang of Congress politicians who dominated Delhi's political landscape in the 1980s, men like H.K.L. Bhagat, Sajjan Kumar and the durable Jagdish Tytler. These men did come to national attention, but for the wrong reasons: their behaviour during the Congress-led pogrom that targeted Sikhs after the assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984.
	When Delhi became a state of sorts, thanks to the 69th Amendment, there was great excitement, and the BJP won a handsome victory in the inaugural election in 1993. A series of BJP notables - Vijay Kumar Malhotra, Sahib Singh Verma, Sushma Swaraj - took turns at being chief minister. But thanks to the remarkable success of Sheila Dikshit in making Delhi a Congress borough from 1998 to 2013, Delhi's politics went back to being predictable and local.
	The turning point in the history of Delhi's politics was the assembly election of 2013, when the Aam Aadmi Party led by an inspired Arvind Kejriwal turned both customary wisdom and poll predictions on their head and won enough seats to form a government, which famously lasted 49 days before it committed suicide. For six months between the assembly elections in Delhi and the results of the Parliamentary elections in May 2014, a politics incubated in Delhi seemed central to the politics of India... and then the bubble burst. The AAP won four parliamentary seats in all and none in Delhi. The BJP won a resounding majority and Narendra Modi towered over a political landscape populated by runts and pygmies. Good governance, responsible realism and Amit Shah seemed to carry all before them.
	So why are anchors and pundits excitedly discussing snap polls in late January 2015 when the real polls ought to be a foregone conclusion? Is the resurgent excitement about the AAP's prospects one last spasm of wishful thinking by a defeated commentariat routed by Modi and the BJP? Or does the gossip about Kiran Bedi's induction and the BJP's panic and Kejriwal's new confidence bear witness to the durability of populist politics in India's largest urban cluster? Does it tell us something about the likely trajectory of politics in an urbanizing India, more generally?
	The BJP's calculation in this election has been that the promise of economic dynamism through good governance and charismatic leadership which won them the national election and then a series of assembly elections, should carry the day in Delhi too. Kiran Bedi's co-option has been read as anxiety about this formula not working in the national capital. This might be true, but it is at least as likely that the BJP always saw Kiran Bedi as an ally within India Against Corruption and adopted her as a mascot to lay claim to a share of Anna Hazare's legacy - the authoritarian, discipline-and-punish part of it that fits the sangh parivar's vision of a well-drilled nation.
	In this reading, Kiran Bedi, former policewoman and inspector general of Delhi's prisons, is seamlessly assimilated to Narendra Modi's rhetoric of good, stable governance. She brings the virtuous cachet of India Against Corruption minus the insurgent insolence that was Kejriwal's unique contribution. Thus, she is stable, constant, experienced and true where Kejriwal is mercurial, untried, a bhagora and an anarchist. I don't find it hard to believe that Amit Shah picked Kiran Bedi out as a trump card early on and played her late to finesse Kejriwal.
	I do believe, though, that the move hasn't worked for two reasons. The first, less important, reason has to do with Kiran Bedi's shortcomings as a political candidate. Humourless self-righteousness might work for a 'social activist' (it might even be a credential), but it is an unattractive quality in a politician. Confronted by an audience or an interviewer, Bedi begins with smiling generalities and ends with teacherly scolding. She converses in telegraphic talking points that are sometimes surreally at odds with the questions she's being asked. It isn't hard to see why her handlers don't want her to debate Kejriwal and her refusal to engage does seem to be hurting the BJP's prospects in Delhi.
	But Bedi's persona wouldn't matter so much if the BJP's understanding of the legacy of India Against Corruption was accurate. It isn't. The BJP seems to believe that the extraordinary support the IAC mobilized in Delhi and urban India was provoked by corruption and can, therefore, be addressed by good, honest governance. This is an overly literal reading: corruption in the hands of the AAP was a metaphor for the misery inflicted on citizens by an opaque, unaccountable and distant State.
	The rudeness and insolence that became Kejriwal's trademarks during his first campaign, thrilled his supporters not because their natural home was an anarchist mob, but because it was a public and dramatic way of putting the State, its agents and its enablers in their place. The white Ambassador with its red light and siren, the VIP cavalcade, the predatory cop and the untouchable private corporation became symbols of a system that shuts out its citizens. The obverse of this was that fabled beast, the Lok Pal, a Grand-Inquisitor-cum-dragon that would keep an incorrigible system honest, plus radical devolution that would bring the State within the reach of the neighbourhoods and localities in which citizens live.
	Delhi is wall-papered with wonderfully detailed portraits of Narendra Modi wearing kurtas of many colours, but only two expressions. The first, early batch of posters has Modi, not smiling precisely, but looking gracious. The second, more common sort, has him impressively groomed as always, but impassive, formidable. Kejriwal's posters are more animated: one of them has him in a crowd being greeted by an old man.
	Modi's charisma, Kiran Bedi's administrative experience and the BJP's rhetoric of good governance do not directly address radical disenchantment with an opaque and centralized system. Delhi's election will turn on whether the urban citizen's angry skepticism about the State is allayed by the pharaonic reassurance offered by Modi or harnessed by Kejriwal's theatrical promise to cut Leviathan down to size. Meanwhile, we can enjoy the BJP's questions, the AAP's answers and Kiran Didi's bid to be a small star to Modi's sun. To nit-picking idiots who point out that small stars are big suns up close, she might gnomically say, as she has said elsewhere, "That's my choice. That's my choice. And you have to respect it."(Source: The Telegraph)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            I'm a Modi fan but I hope BJP loses this election. The reason is Modi has become arrogant - his quips about voting for a lucky person, and that the Delhi Govt will be afraid of him deserve punishment. His bubble should be pricked. As for Kiran Bedi, indeed she comes across as a cross schoolteacher than a friend. Amit Shah may be gloating about grabbing Bedi, but I think she comes from the same self righteous strain as Kejriwal. It is time to prick BJP's bubble

                            The move hasnt worked only for media Mr Kesvan. Even AAP supporting channels say KB is close in choice for CM. Idk what's your motivation for writing fiction, but you should realize this is the age of social media. There are substitute source for information now. Do you remember your predictions in LS?

                            You are wrong sir. We have one agenda of governance and development. We do want to convert Delhi into another West Bengal. We do not want chaos and anarchy back into our streets. These are ground concerns.

                            Kiran Bedi is the best choice as the CM of Delhi. BJP should advice her to not make controversial statements . She should interact with the media only when required. Though truthful she might come across as outspoken.<br/>
As a  supporter we request her to stay cool and graceful .<br/>
Mannerisms do count.<br/>
Ms. Bedi We hope you are listening. We want you to win  and not lose because of a few bold statements.

                            I don't want to be judgmental nor am I an expert in politics. Looking at the whole discourse, and without getting into the details of who good, bad or ugly, a sharp contrast is observed between AK and KB -<br/>
One may agree or disagree with AK and his politics. But in last couple of years what he could establish that he is here to stay as a politician. In the first place, had he been taken an opportunistic approach, he would have easily joined BJP, when double anti incumbency was in its supreme against Shila as well as Union Govt. and he could easily have reaped benefit out of it to fulfill his personal ambition. That would have been much much easier option than to set a political party completely from scratch and fight election alone. That was indeed a most difficult track to follow, specifically in a country like ours where, money and muscle power and dynasts rule. Just think, AK in BJP would have swept the 2013 assembly election with a thumping majority. And I am sure offer was open to him as well that time.<br/>
On the contrary, what we saw now, madam KB, who was tearing apart BJP and other political establishments till a few days ago suddenly joined the same party which she was completely against to. He criticized AK several occasions, for diluting the IAC movement and joined in the same mud, what they have started their agitation against. She then suddenly discovered the same discourse to be fit enough to plunge into and even got declared herself for the numero uno position and started vehemently disowning whatever her position was on many issues few months back. <br/>
The contrast is wide and open.

                            Kejriwala's support base was Auto Drivers, when he became chief minister with support of congress his credibility (if any) disappeared. This election congress vote, minority will go to AAP and majority will go to BJP, final result will be a thumping victory for BJP and Shri Narendra Modi.

                            It is what you believe and most analyst who either doesn't have legs on ground or poor strategic sense (but they r called intellectual analyst by media..!) say similar things.<br/><br/>
Before Bedi's name announced, AAP's main tool of campaign was Leadership (AK vs who) and there was wide gap between CM choice (AK - 40% to 50% and 2nd number was at around 10%. Almost 30% to 35% gap which now remains hardly 5% to 10%). Also AAP was blaming charges of corruption against Mr. Satish Upadhyay &amp; other BJP's leader. No one was going to check reality of blames but it would have hurt BJP's prospect.<br/><br/>
By putting KB as CM candidate - BJP neutralize leadership issue. Also it helped BJP to narrow gap between 1st &amp; 2nd Choice of CM. Also many who didn't like BJP's 2nd level leadership would shift to BJP again and women voters would prefer Bedi. <br/><br/>
These would help BJP in final voting. KB is not a crowd puller or orator like AK and she has limitation in debating due to her policing nature. But no one denied her administration experience, her anti-corruption stand and. <br/><br/>
So this was strategic decision for BJP's interest. Yest it has demoralize many 2nd level leaders of BJP but Amit Shah knows that same 2nd level leaders would not able to lift-up BJP's prospect and they were relaying on Modi's karishma only. Then why not use face which can be longer bat for party

                            @rama: The statement doesn't directly corroborate with the ground reality. In spite of UPA was in power, couple of BJP Govts in Chattisgarh, MP were doing good work, Mr. Nitish Kumar in Bihar and Mr. Pattnaik were also trying best of their abilities to perform in their respective states. UPA in power was never a constraint for them to deliver even though most of the states mentioned are very low in different social and financial indicators.  On the contrary, earlier BJP Govt. in Delhi was horrific in terms of performance (1993-98).  And remember, one of then CMs is still in politics and holding an important ministry in Union cabinet. A good person can not necessarily be a good administrator.

And then Modi and his hope of luck, want India to be a Global super power. The fact is that with this kind of leadership, we can say as Cassius  said.."

                            It remains to be seen how AAP will perform with its second chance, now that they have the majority. Winning elections by taking the populist route is easy but the task of governing and making the populist promises into reality is tough. These results are definitely historic and mainstream parties might better want to learn from the trouncing that they got, especially Congress which has become a totally irrelevant party (0 seats,Ouch!!). The post-election result speeches have been interesting, talk about eradicating corruption, cheap electricity/water etc. The voting public which supported AAP have been promised the moon and stars, it will be interesting to see how they go about delivering it.
