Headline::::Why Congress is Untrustworthy Ally for Liberals



DateTime::::2015-11-08T23:17:00+05:30



This was an opening statement in a panel discussion at the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation's conference on republican values. The theme of the discussion was 'Freedom'.
This discussion on "freedom" has two contexts. One is the recent troubles in our country, the feeling that we are living through a time when our freedoms are challenged by an intolerant majoritarianism. This is a good time to reflect on the cardinal republican values: equality, democracy, secularism and freedom.
The second context for this discussion is quite literally this conference's location: the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, an institution closely associated with the Congress. Taken together, these two contexts give me my theme. I want to examine the relationship of the republican Congress with the freedoms guaranteed in our constitution.
 
In this time of political crisis, when anxious citizens look for political allies to defend their freedoms, how likely are they to look to the Congress? Not very likely, because the Congress in its decades in office helped create the legal and administrative apparatus that eroded our civil liberties. Congress governments either pioneered illiberal laws or willingly built on oppressive precedents authored by others.
 
Take the example of cow-slaughter, if only because the lynching of Mohammad Aklaq created such moral revulsion. Congressmen condemned the murder and denounced the BJP for its bigotry in its aftermath. But the historical record shows that it was Congress governments in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh that passed the first cow-protection acts. They didn't have to; directive principles aren't justiciable, but they chose to. It's these precedents that the BJP built upon when it legislated draconian punishments for cow-slaughter in states like Haryana.
The Congress doesn't seem embarrassed by this record. Last month Mr Digvijay Singh claimed credit for it. "Out of 29 states,", he said, "cow slaughter is banned in 24 states and these bills were promulgated during Congress rule." He said this after the lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq. He challenged the BJP to draft an all-India bill which he said the Congress would support. How does a party condemn hysterical mob violence over cow-slaughter one moment and press for a general ban the next? The BJP, for all its wickedness, stands for one side of this argument; the Congress manages to stand for both.
Freedom of religion is a foundational republican value. Several Indian states have passed misleadingly named Freedom of Religion Acts that were designed to curb the individual's freedom to convert, implicitly to Islam and Christianity. The first bills of this sort were passed in the late 60s by non-Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. After the Congress regained power in these states, it made no effort to repeal them.
When a party that fetishises secularism won't defend the freedom of an adult to choose his religious beliefs without government interference, what claim does it have to that value? In 2006, a Congress government in Himachal Pradesh passed a freedom of religion bill on the same lines as the law passed that same year by Narendra Modi's Gujarat government. We know the core issues that define the BJP; what does the Congress stand for? How can it claim religious freedom as a defining principle if it won't expend political capital to defend it?
The Congress's record in the matter of defending civil liberties is dismal. All of us here remember the Emergency as a nightmare of authoritarianism and unfreedom. We forget, though, that a state of continuous emergency prevails in large parts of our country thanks to AFSPA, the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, passed by a Congress government in 1958 and upheld by successive Congress governments up to the present. Indian citizens in Kashmir and the North-East have no civil liberties that can't be abrogated at will, and no recourse. In ten years in office, the UPA couldn't find the courage or conviction to repeal AFSPA. If the Congress sees fundamental freedoms as a luxury that can be suspended in the name of national interest, how is it different from the BJP?
 
Nehru's words on freedom have a special resonance in Delhi at this time of year. 31 years ago in this first week of November, Sikhs in Delhi had neither peace nor freedom nor even the right to life. That hideous pogrom and the Congress's responsibility for it should haunt us all when we discuss abstract republican values in comfortable conference halls. If the Congress wants to claim these values, it should stop treating Indians like clients with needs and start treating them as free citizens with rights. The right to embody freedom can't be inherited from Nehru; it has to be earned.

                            Congress has ruined the country with its corrupt ministers. It will be better if the party gets dissolved and people are given some time to forget Congress. Over a period of time Congress has acquired a wrong 'Brand Value', it is neither respected by Hindus nor trusted by minorities. The weakened state of Congress is the sole reason why radical parties have been elected. Simply speaking there has been no reliable alternative.

                            Yes a well documented article.congress has compramised secularism to merely  win elections<br/><br/>
apart from 1984 ,another blunder was 1992 silent watch of babri demolition.though no muslim worshipped all of a sudden congress made it a sacred mosque to play mere politics<br/><br/>
India's curse is Bjp's communalism and Congresses power hungerNess,both parties used Hindus n muslims to be a party to political games<br/><br/>
still  the  only hope is congress for its great few leaders like Manmohan Singh,P.Chidambaram,manishankar ayar,Mr.scindia,Sachin pilot,AK.Antony,president Mukherjee.Jairam ramesh etc who r true secularists but have no say in partylines<br/><br/>
congress needs to introspect and become a independent secular force than listening n succumbing to allies who looted this country with few congressmen

                            Its very easy to blame Congress but we'll forget that at that particular moment Congress was the only National Party to choose to, there was no better option available.  Even Congress men today say they could have done things differently.  Its easy to judge even BJP or other parties will tell they would have done things or handled things differently today.  Past will definitely haunt Congress but they have to survive and revive themselves after all so many people are involved nobody wants bad for there party who does not intend to get good name and fame.  You can not writeoff organisations just because they are bad then all business houses news rooms will be closed.

                            While there can be disagreement with what Mukul Kesavan says , one must remind him that today's Congress is more different than the strident one under Indira and the more democratic and hence more accountable one before Indira. It should also be added that with the party having ceded its upper caste "clientele"(to borrow Kesavan's words), it has to fall back on others and , may be, this has made it a more syncretic/secular party today than a few years ago. By the way, Jinnah's parting with the Congress had a lot to do with his judgment/assumption/misjudgement that the Congress represented the interests of the Hindus more than that of Indians

                            Absolutely right. Congress either shows no spine to actually defend and safeguard india' s secularism on the ground or it actually in many cases practices stealthy communalism..witness Shah Bano case or Babri locks removal. With BJP at least it is quite clear what to expect, ignoring their leaders' nuanced tokenism once in a while. Devil or the deep sea? Make ur choice.

                            Again intellectual arrogance from liberals where they start with the assumption that liberal position is always the right position. This is intolerance of the worst kind as liberals start with the assumption that theirs is the right position and the way forward is in making this position acceptable to everyone who does not agree.

                            Thanks to Indira Gandhi for more than 45 years Congress has stood for opportunism and very little else. Liberalism died long ago, in the early 60s, even though Congress pretends to be a left of the centre liberal party as a Nehruvian legacy.

                            Poetic as it may seem, but India lies in the Imagination of People than in the Geographical Boundaries.How else do we explain our feeling of Unity inspite of the myriad diversity that we have.Our founding fathers tried to build a national spirit by adopting a common constitution , Flag, National Language etc.Our two major national parties i.e Congress and BJP are both caughtup in some TIME WRAP.<br/><br/>
While the people are trying to move on.These parties seem to be cligning on to ideas about india and its aspirations which is far removed from what people are looking for.<br/><br/>
1) People want to move as far as possible from Poverty.Most of the younger generation dream of better education and better jobs or occupations which can give them a better standard of living.This is the only way out of the rampant casteism which breeds on poverty and scarce resources.<br/>
2) People want to get away from the rampant corruption which pushes them into unethical behaviour and have dignity of Labour.Money in all cultures have been used to earn so called respectability.The day we start respecting people for the work that they do rather than how much they have in their pockets, there may be a lesser urge to use corrupt ways. A corruption less society is a myth but atleast we can do with fewer of them.<br/>
3) The younger generation understand the divides that we have but still they want to maintain atleast some sense of harmony so that they can move on and merely based on romantic notions.<br/>
4) India is a country with abundant manpower but mostly unskilled.Skill developement and Technologies which can harness those skills is what people are looking for.<br/>
                Is anyone listeninig ? The People are looking for alternatives and not Old wine in new bottles.

                            The writer understand the real difference between Congress and BJP, Congress does not spread poison in the minds of Hindus of country about Muslim and BJP does.  However, both are political parties and uses their government (and its polices) for their benefit. Best example of Congress is they pleased Muslims in Sha Bano case and to please Hindus, they opened the controversial Babri Mosque. No one says congress is clean, look into history of India since independence and you will find most riots during congress rule all over the India.  However, the government missionary (of congress) does not involve into the riots unlike BJP, who were part of riots in Gujrath and till now our PM does not take the moral responsibility of riots in spite of Mr. Vajpaee's advice.

                            Unfortunately we do not see any viable alternative (yet). Both Congress and BJP are immoral in their own ways and lack the integrity. And AAP has disappointed big time with their immaturity and lack of leadership. When will we have politicians who do their job well ? Surely it is possible in India - look at the stellar jobs some of the Institutions are doing - like the Election Commission, Supreme Court..

                            While I am a BJP supporter, I also give credit to congress for these laws. In a country where 80% of the population is Hindu, you must respect the Hindu sentiments. No number of lectures and sermons on secularism can deny the fact that the ethos of India is Hindu.<br/><br/>
In fact, India need not have been secular. Why did we choose to do it? Had Muslims or Christians been in majority, would India chosen to be secular?<br/><br/>
is banning cow slaughter such a crime? In fact, many Muslims also support it.<br/><br/>
Regarding religious conversion, the liberals lecture on ghar wapsi. Aren't those adults? Do all the people who convert do it voluntarily, or for inducements.<br/><br/>
I think the congress leaders around independence were very patriotic and nationalistic, and they clearly saw the dangers to the concept of India if many such practices were allowed to be continued.

                            Wishful thinking of Mukul Kesavan, along with many other Bhakts, no surprise. First people like-minded with Mukul Kesavan predicted that the grand alliance will fail even before seat sharing is decided. Then they predicted each one will pull the others legs when the voting takes place. Now they are predicting that the alliance will not last long. But Nitish Kumar is such a great leader, far more forward thinking than anyone in BJP and he will manage all the wishful thinkings of Bhakts like Mukul Kesavan.

                            Good analysis but Who else is the 'reliable' ally for Liberals ?  The left parties and  the regional satraps ? The only party with a pan-India presence and whose core ideology is truly liberal is the Congress party.Congress is the only party you can be sure of not siding with the radical right represented by RSS/BJP.Regional parties are known to ally with BJP for their regional interests.  Left parties with their radical left economic policies would only strengthen the 'Development' facade of the RSS/BJP especially in the eyes of the aspiring youth of the country. <br/>
The aberrations  cited by Mukul Kesavan is due to the failure of the Congress leadership especially from Rajiv Gandhi onwards.It is true that the Congress party is blind to the leadership  crisis facing the party.Let us only hope that sane advise prevails on the powers that be in Congress Party.

                            @everyone Let me tell u something.. UPA is some one who steals ur plate of biriyani and wen u cry tht u have no food they give u a plate of rotten dal-roti and make u feel grateful.. Its a mistake to think that ppl have elected bjp to saffronise India.The issue of beef saddens me too.. am a veggie,have no probs with it,but still saddens me.. but if bjp manages to mute these fringe elements and some of their own stupid ppl they have the ability to take India to an enviable position... historically NDA is much less corrupt than SCAMGRESS(sorry for hurting liberals).Its a shame tht the minorities in India(some of my best frnds r christians and muslims ns they love Modi)get misled by these so called sickular liberal parties and parties like AMIM(owaisi fellow's).. The need of the hour is fiscal deficit in general and funds to reduce it in particular..India with a huge number of unemployed graduates need jobs..Its only wen ppl r well off tht these fringe things disappear.. When Mr.vajpayee was there at regime v had surplus money... But ppl are so used to the rotten dal-roti tht upa offer tht nda lost in 2004...I would say tht it is our mistake.. Modi is doing a fantastic job now.. I hope these prestitute media like ndtv and India today stop damaging the image of India.. As Mr.Anupam kher said,u can b anti-congress or anti bjp but not anti national.. the media has certainly become anti national to nurture their own interests

                            This country claims to be "socialist, democratic, secular republic" - and it is just a "democratic republic".<br/><br/>
If socialism was applied, Naxalism would have been support-less. Now it is too late to act socialist.<br/><br/>
Secularism never came to India. A true secular constitution will have no reference to religion or caste.<br/><br/>
NO political party is ready to make the country truly secular. They fear if they promise it, only one person, me, would vote for it.

                            Yes,you are all right in your thoughts.when your thoughts,resonate with that of a party,slowly you tend to lean towards that party and its ideas without even noticing it.gradually this process becomes complete till something drastic happens to shake you.Thus the leaning is natural and one must have without which you can't be emphatic.Now let's talk about congress.This party originally belonged to India and gradually drifted due leanings of its leaders towards the leaders of other countries for for fame,selfishness or greatness or whatever and in the process this party lost it's indianness and came under the influence and invisible control of other countries and their thoughts.This gradually led to India and Indians loosing respect and dignity.Then comes BJP with a promise of restoring the lost respect and national honour.With all its follies BJP as a party always looks at Indian intetests ,while desperately doing worthy and unworthy things to enjoy power.But the congress too does all those things for power ,but does not hesitate to barter away country's intetests when it comes to its interests or its leaders intetests.That definitely is not the case with BJP at least for now or near future.This unending loud noise of BJP being hardline Hindu party and it being in power will divide the country is the only way all non BJP parties are trying to be together .This again is one of the regular features of Congress for a longtime to perpetuate the idea that Hindus and Muslims in India are sworn enemies and they are ready to kill each other.This is the damage they are causing continuously to Indian psyche and the forcing the rest of the world to look at India in that light.But the fact is Indians as group will not fight a all  and indians love one another and live together.<br/>
In nutshell following are the messages to Muslims:<br/><br/>
Congress and regional parties: You always remain in fear.You will be killed by Hindus if BJP in power.But Same Hindus will not kill you if we are in power.We will protect you. We will treat you special<br/><br/>
BJP: You are not special and you are like rest of the Indians.You live life like others.What congress telling you are lies.Dont believe it and be normal.<br/><br/>
Though it is not true,Muslims tend to believe Congress due to partition history the losses they suffered in riots in congress rule in various states and later in Gujarat due to political manoeuver of congress mostly during pre election periods.Anyone one in their place will tend to believe in congress because Congress is saying "I WILL PROTECT YOU" whereas BJP  is saying "YOU DONT NEED PROTECTION".<br/><br/>
It is for each one of us to judge who and what is good for India in the longrun.Congress wants Muslims to think like Muslims forever and BJP wants them to start  think like Indians. <br/>
Basis above,I believe as an Indian BJP is better than others for a better Indian future due to reasons explained above.Congress at best will maintain status quo while putting Indian interest at risk for their selfish intetests and survival.

                            The Congress &amp; the BJP &amp; the Samajwadi &amp; Lalu &amp; Maywati all represent the feudal- corporate-crony- mafia- journalist-corruption nexus which the country needs to remove and replace with a new kind of poltics which is represented by AAP. Unless poltics is changed from within nothing will change

                            I think enough has been said here on the reason for BJP losing this badly. May I just make a small point? Now sitback and relax until next assembly elections wherever they are due. Couple of months before that event, you can start noticing something to chew upon in the main stream media. Similar to church attacks, dadri, beef, award wapasi. Nothing untoward will happen till then.

                            Politics, especially in a vastly illiterate and proudly indifferent country like our is all about who shouts the most - no matter what the message is or how sensible or idiotic it is. Yours is a detailed article. But just this one piece is not going to be enough in this current melee. The same NDTV which has chosen to publish your article - will it invite a knowledgeable panel and telecast a discussion on this? Will it repeat the telecast ?? Congress right now is singularly focused on rendering Modi Government ineffective. They are calling in favors. We all know how long they have been in power. Imagine how much favors people of various stripes will owe them?? BJP with all its "loud mouths" is also not doing anybody any favor. Need of the hour is sane yet strong voice. Only NaMo can do something about it - hopefully he has realized it is about time now. It might seem petty at his level but in an environment like ours if nonsense is the order of the day, he has no choice but to face it head on. Losing a "cow belt" like Bihar fortunately is not the end of the day.

                            Banning cow slaughter is not the issue, but lynching people in the name of religion is. VHP/Bajrang Dal/ sriram sene etc. will find some pretext or other to attack miniroties because modi-shah are moody towards them... that is the real issue of violence and divisiveness

                            Well written Mukul, May be a bit late. It would have been more effective if you had written this  during the Dadri Uproar!!!! It is not what the Congress did or did not do that matters. The fact of the matter is that over the period of the last 60 years, they  and their entire spectrum of leftists and minority cultivators have infiltrated every institution worth its name in the country and have been on their pay directly or indirectly. the present aggregation of the hindu votes threatens to unwind the entire structure of cast and communal vote bank  and the freebies for many. Hence at the slightest pretext ,the entire spectrum from media to senile intellectuals, rise and create a din. It is sad that none of them realize that in their selfish interest, they are sacrificing the nation and its interests. God Save India.

                            Mr author my answer pity on you. Never in congress rule one felt that they can be killed in the house for being a different religion. We dont see Churches set on fire and police calling it short circuit, who care about cow slaughter law lets talk about human getting killed by BJP minister son, librals that you are talking about dont exist, BJP has called Patriots as Librals and hindu fundamentalists as patriots . <br/><br/>
Modi talks like a woman criticizing and insulting others, Slander, insult and people like you hear to this and clap, have you forgotten how an educated man speaks while addressing citizens.<br/><br/>
Leave Cow slauther law lets talk about Gujrat riot, BJP equates it to 84 riots ,  Let me tell you 84 riot was a reaction to an event which happened only once, but hatred spewed by BJP leaders is perpetual its filling hatred into unemployed ppl turning them into hate robots.<br/><br/><br/>
Bihar result is a slap on your face Mr author, thats what Indians think about BJP. <br/>
As Indian I dont care about your Cow slaughter law (MY foot)<br/>
As Indian I care about country and its people, I dont want my neghbour to be killed for he being diffrent <br/>
religion.

                            Indian electorate system adopted from the British is made for a homogenies society and not suited for a country like India with its huge diversity. Had we chosen the German electorate system, partition wouldn't have happened. As long as we have the British system we will never be free from divisive, vote Bank politics. India just can't  or will not free itself from British soul
