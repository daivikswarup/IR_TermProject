Headline::::PDA is in Our Culture. Hindutva Brigade, Take That.

(Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)
	Happy Valentine's Day! Assuming, of course, that you're celebrating it, which these days in India is a somewhat risky business. After years of attacking couples holding hands on February 14th, trashing stores selling Valentine's Day greeting cards and shouting slogans outside cafes with canoodling couples, Hindutva activists have changed tactics this year. The Hindu Mahasabha has announced that it will send squads out to catch any unmarried couples out for a tryst today and promptly cart them off to a temple to be married. (And, if Sakshi Maharaj has his way, they will be lectured on the virtues of producing between four and ten children forthwith, in order to give his fantasies a voting majority.)
	The changing face of intolerance might be amusing if it weren't for the fact that all involved are deadly serious. The nativists argue that Valentine's Day is an imported celebration, which it is (but so is Christmas, or Id-ul-Nabi, or International Women's Day, for that matter, and they don't have the nerve to attack those). They also argue that it is un-Indian because it celebrates romantic love, and there they're completely wrong. In fact historians tell us that in ancient times, there was a well-established Hindu tradition of adoration for Kamadeva, the lord of love, which was only abandoned after the Muslim invasions in medieval times. But then no one in the Hindu Mahasabha has any real idea of Hindu tradition - their idea of Indian values is not just primitive and narrow-minded, it is also profoundly anti-historical.
	In fact what young people today call "PDA" or "public display of affection" was widely prevalent in ancient India. As late as the 11th century, Hindu sexual freedoms were commented upon by shocked travellers from the Muslim world. Today's young celebrants of Valentine's Day are actually upholding India's ancient pre-Muslim culture, albeit in a much milder form than is on display, for instance, in Khajuraho. How ironic that they should incur the disapproval of the self-appointed custodians of Bharatiya Sanskriti!
	But it's the "self-appointed" part where the real problem lies. All this is being done in the name of a notion of Indian culture whose assertion is based on a denial of our real past. India's culture has always been a capacious one, expanding to include new and varied influences, from the Greek invasions to the British. The central battle in contemporary Indian civilization is that between those who, to borrow from Walt Whitman, acknowledge that as a result of our own historical experience, we are vast, we contain multitudes, and those who have presumptuously taken it upon themselves to define -in increasingly narrower terms -what is "truly" Indian.
	 
	Modern Hinduism has always prided itself on its tolerance for difference. In fact, Swami Vivekananda, whom the bigots ignorantly lay claim to, went farther, and spoke of the hallmark of our civilization being not just tolerance but acceptance - the Hindu idea of sarva dharma sama bhava, that all ways to the divine are equally valid. The Hindu Mahasabha and their ilk, out to despoil the innocent fun of Valentine's Day celebrants and even to impose their puritanical ideas upon them by carting them off to shotgun weddings, are fundamentally betraying Hinduism.
	 
	The central tenet of tolerance is that the tolerant society accepts that which it does not understand, and even that which it does not like, so long as it is not sought to be imposed upon the unwilling. Those who persecute young boys and girls trying to celebrate Valentine's Day have no right to claim they are doing so in the name of a culture which has long been a byword for tolerance. Their narrow-mindedness and bigotry betray the very culture they claim to be defending.
	 
	For where, in the Hindutva brigade's definition of "Bharatiya sanskriti," do the erotic sculptures of Khajuraho belong? Should their explicitly detailed couplings not be pulled down, as Fashion TV's cable signals were during the last BJP government? What about the Kama Sutra, the tradition of the devadasis, the eros of the Krishna Leela - are they all un-Indian now?
	 
	When the late, great Nobel Prize-winning Mexican poet Octavio Paz wrote his final ode to our civilization, In Light of India, he devoted an entire section to Sanskrit erotic poetry, basing himself, among other things, on the Buddhist monk Vidyakara's immortal 11th-century compilation of 1728 kavya, many of which are exquisitely profane. Are poets like Ladahachandra or Bhavakadevi, who a thousand years ago wrote verse after verse describing and praising the female breast, to be expelled from the Hindutva canon of "Bharatiya sanskriti"? Should we tell future Octavio Pazes seeking to appreciate the attainments of our culture that the Mahabharata on TV is "Bharatiya sanskriti," but a classical portrayal of the erotic longings of the gopis for Krishna is not?
	 
	It may not seem to matter very much what some lumpen elements think of Valentine's Day. But it is precisely this kind of narrow-mindedness that also led to the notorious "pulping" of Wendy Doniger's erudite studies of Hinduism. If these intolerant bullies are allowed to get away with their lawless acts of intolerance and intimidation, we are allowing them to do violence to something profoundly vital to our survival as a civilization.
	 
	Pluralist and democratic India must, by definition, tolerate plural expressions of its many identities. To allow the self-appointed arbiters of Bharatiya sanskriti to impose their hypocrisy and double standards on the rest of us is to permit them to define Indianness down until it ceases to be Indian.
	 
	I trust that the police will intervene against the officious busybodies of the Hindutva brigades every time they try to intrude on a young Valentine's Day couple.And maybe the BJP government, with its fondness for rebaptizing Government schemes with new Sanskrit appellations, should give serious thought to just calling Valentine's Day Kamadeva Divas. Then the Hindu Mahasabha could be given a few ancient texts and told to rediscover the glories of their own ancient culture. It might actually broaden their bigoted minds.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            It is true our ancestors were more open about love. But we should also remember they did not cheat women. A man could not dump the woman after making love. Society did not ridicule the dumped woman while the man moved on. In those days, making love was called 'Gandharva vivah' and the woman had all rights and respect of wife. In those days, men did not take videos and share it with the world or blackmail the woman. <br/><br/>
I dont agree with the antics of fanatics in banning valentines day, but at the same time I wish people would also talk about the truth of valentines day, that it only helps greeting card companies , restaurents and jewellers. Most people I know feel quiet miserable on valentines day.

                            Very sensible article. I really hope we strengthen our secondary and tertiary curriculum with real history of India..Not the one right wing tries to impose on young minds..As for Tharoor himself, it is more and more clear to me that BJP's arm twisting to keep him silent is not working. They tried their best to implicate a man who lost his wife. BJP and the paid media highlighted his marital issues as a reason to murder his wife..After all, I don't think there a single marriage exist in this world without issues..some major some minor..

                            Why do all the politicians are anti-Hindus? If things like valentine day or rose day are not part of Hindu culture, it is accept it.<br/><br/>
Politicians endorse Muslims when they include Quran in madrasa. No objection as they cannot even think of it.<br/>
Politicians endorse Christians when they convert other religions to Christians under church. When they teach bible in their schools, no objection. <br/><br/>
But these Hippocrates, two face people, raise their voice when it comes to teach sanskrit in schools. When it comes to saraswati pooja in schools. When we talk about teaching Geeta in schools it become a communal ism.

                            what is the connection to Hindutva? Whether it is right or wrong, the opposition to this celebration is on the ground that this is not Indian way. So, in a way are the people accepting that Indians are hindus only?<br/><br/>
Are all people of other communities in favor of Valentines day?

                            Very well said, Mr Tharoor. You can fight these bigots by bringing in light, the basic tenets of tolerance and sexual freedom inscribed within the philosophy of hindu civilization. No one brings more shame and sophistry to hinduism than these fanatics,whose sole idea is to confront but not to constructively  contribute.

                            In every civilization known to man, there have been groups who opposed man's freedom.  The whole concept of religion is based on this premise of curtailing man's freedom. Man's insecurity about his existence is the root for him to control his environment.  What you see today are fringe losers who can't accept man's freedom the way they see it. This is nothing to do with Hindutva or for that matter keeping of Indian culture.  Tomorrow,  I hope ISIS is not considered keeper of Islam as they are paid mercenaries hired to do a job. The best way to deal with these looser is to ignore them.

the jobless/people suffering from low self esteem or from inferiority complex or just plain J or the ones out to create trouble, enforce the existing laws.<br/><br/>

                            Mr. Tharoor, you say 'from the Greek invasions to the British'...Don't try to rewrite the History! From whatever little we know, Greeks tried but failed. The real onslaught started with Islamic invaders and natives had to endure this for next 1000 years. You also mention about Khajuraho, at that time, natives were identified by a single culture, sanathan dharma, which was and is always a open architecture. Freedom of expression is inbuilt. 1000 years of subjugation might have just made the natives suspicious about such practices!!!

There is no party that called itself liberal till now, and you speak like a true liberal. You must start your own party and bring together like minded individuals. Everyone must live the way they choose to live as long as they don't disrupt the functioning of the society. Free speech must never be curtailed. On a related subject, we must save AIB.

The only challenge is that today we see so many suicides, divorces and crimes after going modern with valientines day, knowing and loving and dating for a long time before marriage but the marriage ends in divorce. The divorce rates are increasing very steadily even after celebrating valentines day. Any idea why.

                            Agreed on all points..well, lets also ask "What are really the premises that makes a person a hindu, and what not? Same applies for a Muslim or a Christian and likewise for all religions"..my definition of a hindu is "One who understands the Hindu teachings, and abides by the norms set forth by them, and NOT simply by birth into a "Hindu" family"..after all what is a religion?..it's a belief system, you develop your belief system and are not born with it..going by this definition, I don't think just by proclaiming oneself to be "Hindu by birth" (again what is "Hindu by birth" really!! I would not know), one neccessarily does not become a Hindu..and if all one does is bigotry in the name of Hinduism, a Hindu Mahasabha activist does not become a hindu..

                            the most important point  you missed out Mr. Tharoor about Ancient India is that ALL PDA in ancient India was among the MARRIED couples. Get that straight.<br/><br/>
Not just that, just because some king built the khajuraho temples doesn't mean that the "sastras" and the culture accept it as legitimate. A king did what he wanted to. <br/><br/>
Please do not mislead people with your half knowledge of what happened in the Ancient past. The only "pramanas" / proofs you have are the surviving sastras about what the culture of India ought to be and the easiest one to understand them are the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.<br/><br/>
Please point us to one instance of any PDA among unmarried couples that has been scripted as an accepted practice in either of these two texts.

                            Often when dealing with cultural expressions of the subcontinent, the critique is not based on real foundational moorings. These were largely astrological, as the two epics reveal. In the context of sexuality, perhaps the main focus of the evolving society was the transformation of a particular part of the human constitution that was the most demanding of attention since it involved the atavistic drive embedded in the human race. It was Mars, a factor related not only to sexuality and eroticism, but also to death in the zodiacal system. When the entire zodiac of 12 is know as the ‘journey' demanded of the Initiate, and whose ‘doors are opened by the months and the years' (Rig Veda), this reveals the explicit reference is to the month/signs, or the various stages of the journey that constituted the areas of the nature that had to be transformed in order to reach the summit of the quest. We note that at the 8th stage the issue of either sexuality and/or death is presented to the aspirant. He/she has to pass through this test in order to attain the condition of Immortality and to eschew the atavism of ordinary humanity. The interesting aspect to note is that sexuality, or what could be considered the lower aspect of Mars, was not denied its place and function, but was simply understood as a stage one had to pass through if higher aspects of life were to be enjoyed. This is portrayed in temple architecture at Konarak in the famous Sun Temple. The erotic sculptures are on the temple's external façade. In addition, the Journey (through the months and the years as stated in the Veda) is emphasized by the temple portrayed as the Sun's chariot, precisely moving from month to month in the ecliptic journey. Once inside the temple, that eroticism vanishes. The aspirant has entered the solar world, Swar of old. He or she has passed beyond the lower aspects of Mars but on the basis of those very transformed Mars energies the victory is secured. Appropriately this takes place in the 10th month of the year known as Makar in India, which is the month known as the ‘exaltation of Mars'. This could be a long story, but enough for now.<br/><br/>

                            you preach very well but don't practice. Why did you have to shout at Sunanda in the flight if you are so particular about people and how they should display their love.<br/>
Shashi- talk sense. there are bigger challenges that the country has to face. <br/><br/>
