Headline::::Rahul Gandhi Returns With Recharged Batteries



DateTime::::2015-04-20T20:54:00+05:30



(Mani Shankar Aiyar is a Congress MP in the Rajya Sabha)
I have just returned from the Kisan-Khet Mazdoor rally. What a smooth and seamless return it has been. There was no sense of disconnect between the departure of Rahul some 60 days ago and his return now. The prophets of doom find their mouths stoppered. Tragedy has not accompanied his going away. Disintegration has not heralded his coming back.
That Rahul decided, apparently suddenly, to disappear from the public sphere is not as unusual as is being made out.  Mahatma Gandhi himself took "leave of absence" from politics for all of four years between 1924 and 1928 as he introspected over whether non-violence and religious harmony could, in fact, be taught to hundreds of millions of people or whether Chauri Chaura and communal rioting symbolized the real India. For reflection, he preferred the sanctorum of his ashram at Sabarmati to the politics of the time. Indeed, he was not even contemplating a second innings. That was thrust upon him by Motilal Nehru almost begging him to attend the 1928 Calcutta session of the All-India Congress Committee to provide the elder Nehru a protective screen against his own son, Jawaharlal, who had taken up cudgels against his father's Nehru Report on constitutional change for advocating Dominion status, not 'Purna Swaraj'. As seamless was the Mahatma's return to centre-stage after absenting himself for four years, equally seamless was Rahul's re-emergence after two months. It is not necessary to always be the cynosure of all eyes to do one's political duty.
As for Rahul not disclosing his destination, it does not need a long memory to recall that when Sonia Gandhi fell ill a few years ago and had to go abroad for treatment, no one knew where she had gone and speculation was rife about both her whereabouts and the cause of her absence. We now have some idea of where and why she went. It was not necessary for us to know then, any more than it was necessary for us to know now, that Rahul had gone to Myanmar for a course of meditation. Unlike anywhere in India or perhaps anywhere in the world, Myanmar is the most closeted country in the world for anyone who seeks privacy, besides being an outstanding Buddhist centre for meditation and vipassana. Privacy is most demanded by those who have the least of it. Rahul has had to suffer the invasion of his privacy since infancy. Remember the post-Emergency ditty when little Rahul was all of seven years old:Desh ki neta Indira Gandhi,
Yuvaon ka neta Sanjay Gandhi,
Bachchon ka neta Rahul Gandhi,
Bhaad mein jaye Mahatma Gandhi.
There are some who take to their security detail like ducks to water. They love being surrounded by gun-toting guards. There are others who hate the way their private space has been usurped by the AK 47. For them, escaping constant surveillance is as much a relief as having Black Cats hanging around is a thrill for others. If Rahul prizes his privacy, as he has done these last two months, it warrants sympathy, not censure.
Moreover, sententiousness about politics being a 24x7 job was negated the moment Rahul mounted the stage. The party was in readiness for him, not moping about his having been away. And, in any case, it is only in India that this nonsense about politics being 24x7 is bruited about. Prime Ministers and Presidents in most countries take time off to recharge their batteries. Those who talk of 24x7 politics are those who get most bored and feel most neglected when they are not surrounded by a thousand suitors a day - with no vision beyond their own advancement, and no interests other than the lowest forms of politicking, plus fear that if they are out of sight, they'll soon be out of mind. Rahul has no such apprehension.
It was argued that it was eccentric, at best, and thoroughly irresponsible, at worst, for Rahul to vanish just as the Land Acquisition Ordinance was capturing national attention. The confidence with which Rahul spoke at Sunday's rally, and the attentiveness with which he was heard, demonstrated that his absence notwithstanding, the Congress, under the leadership of his mother, had built up the momentum for Rahul's homecoming to be a memorable occasion. Of the speeches made at the rally, I, for one, found his intervention the most substantive - careful delineation of the arguments against the ordinance, followed by a stinging direct attack on Modi for promulgating the ordinance as payback to the "capitalists" who funded Modi's poll campaign to the tune of tens of thousands of crores of rupees.  It was a speech that nicely blended hard-nosed logic with a rousing political theme. That is the mark of leadership.
Unerringly, Rahul targeted the usurpation by the state of land belonging to subsistence farmers and the landless agricultural labour that works the land, as being the essence of the "Gujarat model" that Modi hopes to replicate all over India. Big Business funded him in the expectation that he would return their gift manifold by seizing hundreds of thousands of acres worked by the poor to hand over to the super-rich at dirt cheap prices. That is why this battle is not over legal technicalities, but goes to the heart of the question of whether governance in our country should be for the rich or the poor.
The Congress stands for striking the right balance while tilting towards the poor. Modi believes soothing words can pull the veil over the dirty hijack he has planned. Rahul's speech signaled a return to Nehru and Indira and Rajiv Gandhi, a definitive leftward shift in the party's public stance. It has sent Modi running for cover.  
Seeing mother and son together on the platform, succeeding each other in the speaking order as per the demands of protocol, one wondered why anchors, commentators and BJP spokespersons have been tying themselves in knots predicting an imminent split in the party, even a split in the Gandhi family. It's all been idle speculation, sufficient to fill the empty hour around dinner time, but highly misleading in terms of sound political analysis. Of course, every Congressman and woman has a view on the future leadership. Some have given expression to their views. Others have kept their opinions to themselves. Most will go with the prevailing wind.
But far from spelling confusion, all it means is that a democratic political party  must allow space for a bouquet of views - and the Congress is, despite being maligned to the contrary, a democratic political party. Notwithstanding attempts to paint Congress workers and leaders as automatons just waiting for one of the two ji's to tell them whether the sun rises in the east or the west, almost every Congressman I have ever met has lively views on virtually everything under the sun. He/she is vociferous in discussing these matters with their comrades. Media persons love listening in to the gossip. The moment the media hear two views, they start seeing dissidence.
Dissidence is not dissent. Nor is dissent equal to descent. Internal debate is lively, sometimes heated. But the genius of the party has lain in following debate with consensus, and everyone accepting the final decision, not undermining it.
That is why the spectacle of Rahul and his mother on the stage together was reassuring. Their individual posts, and the relative pecking order, are of secondary significance. The important thing is that the two are together, a duumvirate that works together as a single team with the party and the growing number of other parties that wish to join hands in the struggle against Modi.
So, Modiji, watch out! A united Congress and a united Opposition are coming after you.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

Prime Minister Modi had seen enough from 2002 to till date. Rate your Government from 1947 to till date. You have played vote bank politics on Farmers,Poor etc. U waived 70000 cr loan in order to win again in 2009 election. u never empower anyone, u will align with corrupt in Bihar.

                            Straight to comments section as usualy...it took 56 days to charge the battery, it must be a dud battery which may not lost long. When and how long will it take to recharge again. I think his battery is completely discharged with 15 minutes of blabbering, he may speak only after 5 years.

                            Mr Aiyar: The fact is that  Rahul Gandhis speech was uninspired, mediocre, and along expected lines. Only a fawning sycophant can sing praises about it in this manner.<br/><br/>
Your comparison to MK Gandhi voluntarily leaving politics, and Rahul's unexplained absence is seriously flawed. For one thing, MKG was not a member of parliament whom people had voted to work as a legislator. RG was voted in to do a job, and he gets paid for that by the taxpayer. (Not to mention all the other ways in which the taxpayer bears the burden of supporting him, like SPG protection.) When he is sent to parliament and given a salary for being there, it is rather insolent of him to go meditating in Myanmar, and that too without informing his boss (the people who voted him in and pay his salary) where he is going and why. An employee who does this in a private firm will find his office occupied by a new employee when he returns. He will be fired. Shouldn't that standard apply to parliamentarians as well?<br/><br/>
By the way it is curious to hear you saying that Rahul Gandhi very virtuously shuns security detail and "AK-47s", when the fact is that he and his family are the only people other than the Prime Minister of India, entitled to SPG protection. The SPG, which was raised as an elite unit to guard the PM and his/her family, now has the additional mandate of protect the Gandhi family in perpetuity. And you have the audacity to say that he doesn't like security guards, unlike others - when he enjoys the protection of India's most elite close protection unit, without ever having become PM. By the way, the SPG does not use AK-47s.<br/><br/>
Most of your article is empty verbiage repeating the same slavishness ad nauseum, so there is nothing to counter. As for the last sentence, supposedly a warning, but only ending up as comedy - sure, there will be an opposition to the BJP. The BJP was soundly defeated in the recent Delhi elections by an upstart party. I do not know what will happen in future, whether the BJP would face a tough challenge, and if so, from who. What I do know is that it will not be from the Congress party - not unless cogressis find a few worthy and capable leaders, instead of somebody who happened to be born in the royal dynasty. You know, what they call leadership? Yes, that.

                            Mani comparing Pappu to the great Mahatma Gandhi is the height of sycophancy. And drawing the parallel of great Mahatma to the not-so-great Indira, Sanjay, Rahul.  How can you miss out Rajiv, Sonia, Priyanka and our own Robert?   By the way, the last line of the article takes the cake. 'Modiji?'!  Some entertainment to start the week.

                            Whether Rahul Gandhi has returned with recharged batteries , only time would tell. Experience so far has been RAGA has been non issue as far Indian Politics. During last 10 years there is nothing he could boast that he has done for the country, except tearing ordinances, making guest appearances here and their. People who could not even ensure to keep intact their deposits in 2014 elections ( read Mani Shankar) is fully charged for sure as without sycophancy , they would not be their where they are now.

If world leaders acknowledge Modi then this fellow and Congress  sycophants gets hear burn, Mouth burn and rear end also burns. Raja Sabha elections is due and his time is running out- Lost his deposit and made sure congress lost with his arrogant remark. Now after this the Gandhis will kick his rear end out .

                            sycophancy at its height. Mr Iyer is sort of reassuring to himself that all is well in the Congress and its leadership. His gloating over inner party democracy in Congress reminds me of a cold war era joke.  An American and a Russian were talking about freedom of speech in their respective countries and the American said that in US we can go outside the White House and shout American President down down. The Russian said that in the then USSR too we can go to Kremlin and say American President down down.  In Congress democracy prevails as long as it is not about president and vice president. Wish these talented people could use their talents much better than just singing the praise of the two Gandhis and maybe in a short while from now the 2 Gandhis plus a Vadhra

                            Aiyer should be given the Nobel prize for sycophancy! The ditty was awful. How can grown men behave so shamelessly? Even if you are only a congresswala, you should maintain your basic dignity. Remember that you are a citizen of India. It is basic science that you cannot recharge fused batteries. Modi has to watch out for whom? A united congress and a united opposition? Is this some kind of a sick joke? The kindest explanation to all this seems to be that Aiyer is trying to boost the flat morale of the congresswalas. Well good luck to him and the Congress. Both need lots of it.

We as a race have a problem that everyone even a fool on the street has an opinion on what should not be done but no one ever has an idea of what needs to be done and let alone end up doing it.........just tiring!!!!!

But in Pappu's case, it is reverse, he has to loan it from external source and pass it on to his cadere, by this time Cong cader's filaments got dropped off from poles.   Only poles (Rahul, Sonia) remain, rest every one wiped off.  <br/>

His chai wallah comment had come back to haunt him and anything he says or does reeks of sycophancy. It remains a mystery to me that why do congress people who are educated and many are at the top of their game in their professions choose to put up such a sycophantic show for the Gandhi family. Will someone from congress please clarify? Is there a secret here that the general public in India are missing?

                            A vibrant democracy needs a strong and a balanced opposition party, which can offer an alternative. The erstwhile Congress model was tried for 10 years and found to be woefully wanting. Perhaps the voters expected a return to PV Narasimha Rao's era of economic development. Some parts were shown in UPA I but UPA II was a singular disaster. The GoP of India needs to regroup itself, not just for its followers but for the sustenance of Indian Democracy. For this, unfortunately they have to look beyond the Nehru-Gandhi family. Sonia's distinct crony socialism in UPA II with her NAC did the damage to Congress in the 2014 elections, wherein people have rejected their model outright. RaGa is a disaster in the making. Need a breathe of fresh air in the Congress. Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka should step aside and let someone else emerge from the churning. Mani Shankar Iyer, please see the writing on the Wall.

                            However Rahul approaches his political career is up to him. It is clear that he needs time and experience and I wish him the best of luck. The question for Congress Party is, do they need to just wait and pray for Rahul Gandhi to get ready? Shouldn't they pick someone who is ready now? It is painful to see many able and experienced leaders within the party waiting on the sidelines for him to get ready and rule over them.<br/><br/>
Ruling a democracy requires intra-party democracy in the first place - allowing the best person to be elected to the top post within the party. That's the only way a party can progress - allowing for change, choosing the best leader and charting a new direction. I hope Congress evolves out of this over dependency on a single family - for their sake and for the sake of the country.

                            So basically Mr.Mani Iyer is telling, apart from Nehru-Gandhi family all other congress leaders are "powerless, ineffective, ineffectual, inadequate, weak, feeble, useless, worthless, futile" Is it really worth for Rahul to lead this "powerless, ineffective, ineffectual, inadequate, weak, feeble, useless, worthless, futile" people staying in the party? <br/>
No, No, No Rahul Kick them out and ask them to shut their both. You cannot survive with this flock around you. You need better people around you to rule this nation, if you really have aspiration to be a PM. Don't be forced by someone, who are looking to help themselves and loot the nation putting you in front of everything. At least Ms.Sonia Gandhi has built a circle of loyal political and business friends. She has a fortress around here, she has one agenda to lead the congress and protect the family interests. It Looks very different for you Rahul, you need to build that loyal friends as you age in political career. Once Ms.Sonia Gandhi (read as mother) steps back from political career and passes the baton it's not easy for you. It's not easy to believe in Mani, Manish, Abhishek, Pilot,etc., They just write for heck of writing and speak for the job they have given, no love for the party or for you. Be careful.

                            Dear Mani Shankar Aiyer; can we use Rahul Gandhi's batteries for powering electric cars? If yes, then we can reduce pollution in Delhi significantly as we can expect Rahul to donate his batteries for free for a public cause. Are these batteries powerful enough to run DTC buses? Possibilities are endless. The only problem is that the buses will have to be sent to Thailand for recharging! I did not know that Italian technology in batteries was so advanced.

                            Rahul may have benefited from meditation, but his rhetoric about the land acquisition bill and his 'concern' for farmers is more political than genuine. In Kerala, where his party is in power, huge tracts of land has been forcibly taken over in the name of development and road widening. However, the people who stand to gain most from this are the big businesses, construction companies, and black money launderers. It is high time that the Congress found people other than the Gandhis to lead them. The people of the country are sick and tired of seeing the dynasty carrying on. This is not a healthy trend for any democratic country. People are also tired of sycophants like Mani Shankar Iyer, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Kapil Sibal and others bending over backwards to cow tow to the Gandhis and hold the nation to ransom. The Gandhis have now become a threat to the unity and integrity of the country, and should never be allowed to come anywhere close to power again in this country.

So finally you compare Mahatma Gandhi with Mr. Pappu. Hats off. Please advise Mr. Pappu also to take "leave of absence" for FOUR YEARS like Mahatma gandhi. It will be a great relief to India.

                            @Sarika Bhatia: You are spot on about the Congress in Delhi and if they continue on this path they will be a Big ZERO in Lok Sabha Elections of 2019

                            I have not seen such a funny speech as RaGa in parliament. He was surrounded by some chamchas, they were just shouting Shame...Shame... as it is the only task assigned to them by their god Gandhis. That Gogoi was smiling shamelessly on the issues of farmers, just because they had better figures. It clearly shows they have no pain for farmers, they just want to let govt down, and they are happy to do that.

                            Am sure at some point Mani must have lost belief in his own words while writing an erudite praise for RAul!!

                            accepted. So there is a definite period within which Rahul will get<br/>
discharged.  How long or soon it is going to be!  perhaps only Congress man can guess.  The nation can't be waiting for a leader to get charged!
