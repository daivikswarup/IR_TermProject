Headline::::PM Modi's Olive Branch to his Critics



DateTime::::2015-02-18T19:27:00+05:30



(Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)
	 
	After eight months of silence decried by all of us in the Opposition and by most commentators, Prime Minister Modi has finally raised his voice against the growing climate of religious intolerance unleashed by a rampant Sangh Parivar. Addressing a Christian congregation in New Delhi that was meeting to celebrate the elevation to sainthood of two Catholic figures, Kuriakose Elias Chavara and Mother Euphrasia, and doing so in the wake of mounting concern over the vandalization of six Catholic churches in and around the capital, Mr Modi spoke clearly. His government would not "accept violence against any religion, on any pretext," he declared unequivocally. "I strongly condemn such violence. My government will act strongly in this regard."
	 
	And about time too. Many of us had expressed concern about the damage the irresponsible statements and actions of the Hindutva brigades were doing to Mr Modi's development agenda. The attacks on the churches were symptomatic of a far larger problem that was leaving all minorities feeling insecure. Foreign leaders were taking note too, with President Barack Obama telling a Delhi audience that "India will succeed so long as it is not splintered along the lines of religious faith" and commenting adversely on religious intolerance in India at a Prayer Breakfast on his return to the US. This was clearly not the way the Prime Minister wished his government to be perceived.
	 
	"We consider the freedom to have, to retain, and to adopt, a religion or belief is the personal choice of a citizen," Mr Modi averred. "My government will ensure that there is complete freedom of faith and that everyone has the undeniable right to retain or adopt the religion of his or her choice without coercion or undue influence. My government will not allow any religious group, belonging to the majority or the minority, to incite hatred against others, overtly or covertly. Mine will be a government that gives equal respect to all religions."
	 
	While foreign reporters were quick to portray this as a gesture to Christians and other minorities, rebuking his own followers in the BJP and Sangh Parivar, who had gleefully led the ghar wapasi and love jihad campaigns and repeatedly affirmed that India was a Hindu country rather than the pluralist land of Constitutional practice, some Indian commentators saw it also as Modi signalling to the minorities that they too should look beyond minority rights to India's ancient heritage of tolerance. After all, he said: "My government will not allow any religious group, belonging to the majority or the minority [italics added], to incite hatred against others, overtly or covertly. Mine will be a government that gives equal respect to all religions."
	 
	It is striking, in this context, that the PM used the words "without coercion or undue influence", which some see as a swipe at alleged inducements offered by Christian proselytizers to low-caste Hindus. These four words echo his citing of a declaration made at an Inter-Faith conference at The Hague on 10 December 2008, along the same lines. There is comfort there, surely, for those Hindus who claim to be alarmed about the galloping pace of Christian and Muslim conversions of their co-religionists.
	 
	On the whole, though, there was less here for the Hindutva elements than for others: this was the speech every Indian pluralist was waiting for the PM to make. "Equal respect for all religions," he went on, "must be in the DNA of every Indian. ... I appeal to all religious groups to act with restraint, mutual respect, and tolerance in the true spirit of this ancient nation which is manifest in our Constitution."
	 
	Lest his speech be seen as responding to Obama's tutelage, the PM was firm in affirming the indigenous roots of Indian religious tolerance. "Our Constitution did not evolve in a vacuum. It has roots in the ancient cultural traditions of India. The principle of equal respect has been a part of India's ethos for thousands of years and that is how it became integral to the Constitution of India.... As Swami Vivekananda said: 'We believe not only in universal toleration, but we accept all religions as true.'"
	 
	That was a welcome reminder to those Hindutva activists who have been advocating Hinduism as a badge of identity rather than a set of principles and traditions which are at odds with their narrow-minded bigotry. Modi reminded them that "We believe that there is truth in every religion. Ekam Sat Vipra Bahudha vadanti."
	 
	The speech was welcome, but the real challenge for Prime Minister Modi, as I tweeted immediately yesterday, will be to get the Sangh Parivar to live up to it. The fact remains that the Modi regime has given free rein to the most retrograde elements in Indian society, who are busy rewriting textbooks to glorify Hindu leaders, extolling the virtues of ancient science over modern technology, advocating ghar wapasi, and asserting that India's identity must be purely Hindu. Majoritarian communalism, as Nehru had long recognized, is a fundamental threat to our pluralist democracy. But as a lifelong RSS pracharak, Modi had devoted himself to the very worldview he has now repudiated. Does he really mean it, or will this be yet another fine speech completely divorced from any action?
	 
	I have often pointed out the fundamental contradiction Mr Modi faces, of advocating liberal principles and objectives whose fulfilment would require him to jettison the very forces that have helped ensure his electoral victories. The tension between his indulgence of the Hindutva brigades and his responsibilities as Prime Minister of India had become increasingly apparent. It was affecting not only his credibility as an effective leader of a government committed (as he reminded us in this speech) to "sab ka saath, sab ka vikas", but also his ability to attract the goodwill and investments of foreigners increasingly alarmed by media reports of mounting intolerance. This speech implies the crossing of a Rubicon: he has made his choice. Government and development must prevail, at least in the short-term. Hindu zealotry can wait.
	 
	Indeed, in parallel with the Modi speech, Hindutva leaders have been appealing to the faithful to cool their ardour for intemperate statements and extreme actions. On Sunday, VHP international president Raghav Reddy called on all Hindu leaders to restrain themselves; the next day, VHP joint general secretary Surendra Jain added, "No one should create any roadblock for the PM through any statement, as he is working to realize the aspirations of this country." To add to the impression of orchestrated messaging, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat declared that India's diversity was to be celebrated and chided those who were speaking of Hindu women as baby-manufacturing factories. Mr Modi's speech sets the capstone on a clear and unambiguous policy that development will take precedence over minority-bashing.
	 
	Obviously there are short-term political calculations involved as well: the Budget Session of Parliament begins on 23 February and the Government's legislative plans can't afford the kind of disruptions that were provoked during the winter session by Hindutva extremism.  The Delhi election results, which were in part a rejection of the Hindutva message in favour of AAP's welfare and development advocacy, have also boosted the morale of the opposition. Mr Modi has learnt his lesson, and heeded his critics. His conciliatory speech offers an olive branch to his critics.
	 
	This doesn't mean that the lifelong RSS pracharak has abandoned his commitment to Hindutva or auctioned off his convictions like his controversial name-striped suit. Rather, it suggests that if Hindutva wants to triumph in the long term, it can only do so on the back of a government that is seen by the Indian public to have delivered development. For now, at least, that means swallowing the "garv se kahon ki hum Hindu hain" message in favour of "sab ka saath, sab ka vikas".  If such an approach gets Mr Modi the results he seeks, the Hindutva brigades may rise again. Everyone will be keeping their powder dry.

                            VHP is doing openly, what others were &amp; are doing silently. VHP's Ghar-Wapsi is not communal, if other conversions are Secular. If Ghar-Wapsi is communal, then Other Conversions can't be Secular. Either Stop all types conversion &amp; if that is against freedom of religion, then allow all types of conversion. That would be True Sarva Dharma Samabhaav.

                            This is a welcome move by the PM, it has to be "development for all". The fringe elements have been bogging the headlines inspite of economic revival and good measures by the government. It has to be only development related work going forward

                            Why so much cynisism at the end, Dr. Tharoor. Can't we take what the PM of this country says at face value, instead of attaching lateral meanings and intentions.

                            Shashi Tharoor does not and will not understand Modi in this life. I will point out just two aspects.<br/><br/>
Modi's message was also meant for Christian Missionaries/Evangelist - who denigrate Hinduism, ridicule Hinduism, and fool the ignorant with money, bait and switch tactics to convert- all of which are forms of mental violence and incitement to hatred. Ditto for the Islamic Jihadists.<br/><br/>
Second Tharoor's whole thesis is based on hollow scare mongering Nehruvian ideology. Nehru was the last white ruler of India  as he himself said once, he was more English than Indian and hence his ideology is based on Western view.

                            There are around 6 crore christians and 20 crore muslims in India, did they come from distant lands or were they converts from hinduism. Secular medias mascot, Tehelka, in its earlier edition came out with a report of how conversions are changing demographics of Punjab.Andhra Jyoti came out with an article on how coastal andhra had seen an upsurge of christian population. There are so  many cowboy pastors who openly admit to converting thousands of hindus and healing them from all ailments through prayer. The mainstream english  media should also report on this, otherwise they would be perceived as prejudiced, biased and antihindu.

                            In 2013 3 non tribal hindus were burnt to death in Shillong, Meghalaya a Christian majority state by the locals. Everyone is so silent about it including the so called Sang Parivar who is advocating the rights of Hindus. <br/>
Lets face it there is lot of hypocrisy and holier than thou attitude. Swami Vivekananda was not only a super champion of secularism by word, deed and practice but he was very blunt as well, he had that massive strength and character to openly question Christian Missionaries their way of condemning hindus and forcing them to conversion , albeit with a very professional attitude. Modi seems to talk a lot on Swamiji, I hope he can implement atleast 0.0001% of his ideas.

                            Why is this country and its future hostage to nehruvian legacies ?? Is india  only a 68 year old country ?? Who will answer for the genocide of millions of hindus by invaders and foreign rulers for simply being hindu . Its important for india to set the past right before we move to a brighter future. Our future cannot and should not be decided by the ideas of a man who didnt even deserve to be our prime minister.

                            Converting from any religion to a religion of your choice is the most personal issue of an individual. How it affects either the mainstream or the fringe is devoid of logic.

                            The writer has referred to prime Minister Modi as life long RSS Pracharak.it may be added here that Modi at the moment is holding a Constitutional position of the Prime Minister of India,Personal ideologies of a person do not come in the way of governance,every step of which is to be taken as per provisions of the Constitution.ideological alliances do not find any place in discharge of responsibilities as the Prime Minister.
