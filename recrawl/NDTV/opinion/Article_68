Headline::::What Rohith Vemula's Friends Told Me In Hyderabad



DateTime::::2016-01-21T13:58:00+05:30



- "Please serve 10 mg of Sodium Azide to all Dalit students at the time of admission. With direction to use when they feel like reading Ambedkar."- "Supply a nice rope to the rooms of all Dalit students."
I like to think of myself as a hard-nosed man, even a bit cynical at times and rarely stunned into silence. But when I read the lines above from the letter PhD candidate Rohith Vemula wrote to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hyderabad on December 18, 2015, I was left horror-struck. I found myself groping for not just words but thoughts.
Here was a fine young man, so evident from his scholastic achievements and powers of expression, crying out for help from the head of his institution. A month later, Rohith was dead, driven to suicide by an insensitive university administration, an environment of toxic intolerance, and a society indifferent to the complex issues that trouble the minds of not just young students, but particularly young Dalit students, battling millennia of prejudice.
Five students of Hyderabad University, all members of the Ambedkar Students' Association, had been protesting following their suspension from the institution. The suspension was instigated by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student arm of the BJP. The ABVP was trying to capture the campus and combine political muscle with social bigotry - there is no other word to describe it.
The entire establishment - the local MP, a BJP union minister, the HRD Ministry, now run by a tweet-first-think-later star of the ruling party, and the pusillanimous Vice-Chancellor - simply played second fiddle to the ABVP. The result is a monumental tragedy, not seen on our campuses for years now.
How do I know all this? How am I so convinced? It is because I have seen all the necessary documents and spoken to the students - Rohith's four friends and his other associates. They are remarkable young people - articulate, intelligent, able to marshal facts, capable of running a movement. They contacted us just after Rohith's death. After ascertaining the details, we offered to hold a press conference or a protest in Kolkata, or to visit Hyderabad. They asked us to come.
I flew to Hyderabad on January 19 as the head of a two-member Trinamool Congress delegation; my colleague Pratima Mandal, accompanied me. We were with the students for two hours from 9:30 pm to 11:30 pm, well after the cameras had gone. It was an educative, emotional and inspiring conversation. Those young people are heroic.
The following day, January 20, the students began a relay hunger-strike. They asked me to be present. I was honoured and said a few words. We were being accused of politicising a tragedy. I said, well, if seeking justice for Rohith and his family was politicisation, then so be it. The Congress Vice-President had already visited. The Delhi Chief Minister and a Janata Dal (United) delegation were expected. The CPI(M) and the YSR Congress too had come to show their solidarity. Clearly a disgust with the noxious atmosphere of intolerance that the BJP and its various frontal organisations have created across the country since the election of 2014 has united us. Of course, this is a confrontation. This is a confrontation between tolerance and intolerance. This is a confrontation between justice and injustice.
The students, the friends and associates of Rohith, who are demanding justice for him and compensation and a job for a member of his family, are not political in the party sense. The 14-member Joint Action Committee they have formed comprises students who are otherwise members of different, even disagreeing parties. For them, this is not politics; it is justice for a friend, and a community. It is a determined quest for social justice.
At such moments one cannot be neutral. The self-important news television anchors going on and on about "rent-a-cause politicians" and "parachute politics" have to answer to their conscience. I am at peace with mine.
I write this as I prepare to leave Hyderabad. I have promised the students I will be back whenever required. Trinamool stands by them. The young and brave friends of Rohith, many of them Dalits like he was, deserve that. They are aghast at the Goebbelsian BJP parivar propaganda on Twitter and other social media platforms that seeks to dispute even Rohith's caste. Imagine the mindset - to quibble and quarrel over a dead boy's caste! Can politics fall to lower depths?
I left the students with two pieces of advice. Keep the movement above party politics. We formal politicians are the side cast. The students are the protagonists and the moral soldiers. Stay united, don't break into factions. Your unity is your biggest strength. Don't let the establishment break it, as they will try and do. Fight the good fight, as Rohith would have wanted you to. And as Rohith did.(Derek O'Brien is leader, Parliamentary party Trinamool Congress (RS), and Chief National spokesperson of the party)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Mr. Brien, your description of this tragic event is so moving, and many facts are indeed a part of intolerance of the hindu society for centuries, but putting blame entirely on one political party, is not just insane but stupid. And why couldnt muster same courage to visit along with your team in your home state in Malda, which witnessed much bigger bigotry. OHHH but damn... you couldnt muster a courage to get over your party vote bank... is'int it. If u have even little so called courage you can still visit that place.... But Alas...!! i wonder!!!! wud you....

                            Dear Mr. Derek O'Brien,<br/><br/>
Your opinion piece is very well articulated and I must say even touching. You have presented the dalit students' side of the story very well. Since you were already there at the university campus, did you try to meet the other group of students and get to know their side of the story? After all, this entire episode began primarily as a clash between two different sets of students on the campus. Since the other set of students belong to ABVP, are they untouchable and hence not worth listening to? These are students first and amedkarites or hindu fundmentalists later. This kind of compartmentalization of the students suits opportunistic politics. It gives ample opportunity for politicians like you to fish in troubled waters. If you had bothered to meet the boy who was supposedly beaten up and presented his version here, your feelings for Rohit and his friends would have carried greater conviction. I gather from the news stories that this boy too belonged to a backward caste. If your heart beats so much for the dalits, why does it not care for this boy? Is it because he did not hang himself? Or is it because if you are seen talking to  a ABVP member, you will not get dalit and muslim votes in the coming assembly elections in west Bengal?

                            Your intentions may be right. You and TMC have probably not earned the moral right...at least yet to become a stakeholder where you don't belong. People are cynical about your intentions because you still don't have the political maturity to take criticism yourselves. At least yet. And before you start, am a proud Indian and Bengali. And not a CPIM or a BJP supporter. Just an intelligent Indian who knows to recognize when one is fishing in troubled water without good intention. Atleast yet...

                            Well, almost all of the Universities and colleges in West Bengal are reeling under lawlessness, interference by political parties, poor quality infrastructure and poor quality research and education. Even colleges like Presidency and Jadavpur should now be considered below average going by the indiscipline and poor research. Instead of working on those I am surprised West Bengal politicians have time to work on the issues of other states.

                            Very nicely articulated. In less than 2 years everyone has figured out that BJP did not come in power to deliver a development agenda but a communal agenda. PM Modi will be a 1 term PM due to his neglecting the development agenda and instigating all communities: Muslims, Christians, Dalits etc.  This is very disheartening as we had so many expectations.  We can only encourage these students to fight the good fight at this point.<br/><br/>
BJP feels they can bully everyone since they have so much money power. In fact the BJP troll army will start their attack on your Opinion I am sure.

                            when so many dalits becoming victims of vote bank in UP, Bihar and WB(becouse BJP is not involved in that context), people were dumb.But when it related to a ABVP students , suddenly people are becoming voices of Dalit Students.<br/><br/>
I'm not supporting either ABVP or BJP or any other. But Irony of our nation is everybody wants equality, special incentives based on Caste and but when they treated equally, people say lower/OBCs are discriminated.<br/><br/>
Yes this is Student problem,let us fought in that perspective but not on caste.<br/><br/>

                            I am from a small village in Guntur, lower middle class, disabled and studied in HCU more than 25 years back. I found it challenging since I was shy and found difficult to adjust to university culture, city culture and language (studied in telugu medium up until then). So I concentrated in studies rather than involving in unwanted issues. It is very easy to blame the system rather than amend our behavior, which is so true in Rohith's case. All problems he and his colleagues faced are nothing to do with their studies (funding, supervisor allocation etc). Instead, they fought with another student union ABVP on issues (Yakub Memon hanging, beef festival, tearing the party banners) not related to their studies. So it is incorrect to make the issue as Dalit vs Non Dalit. Rohith chose to be Dalit (mother SC and father BC) and to prove he is true dalit (converts are more religious than those are born into) he behaved as if  he hates hinduism (his father religion) and loves other minority religions and Ambdekar. His FB account filled with news on ASA but not much on Science. So we shouldn't treat this as a Dalit issue for political gains.

If this ugly motley crowd had not come to make political profit out of Rohith Vemula's suicide, what had they come for? Where the carcass lies, there will the vultures be gathered. How true and how terribly grim. Poor Vemula. If he had known that this was how his death would play out, he would have had many reasons not to follow that tragic path.

You are just losing respect day by day. <br/>
First of all, don't make it a caste issue.<br/>
Second, Even if Rohit's frnds called you to see their plight, simple logic is to make it a political issue. Third, Please dont jump to conclusion so early. Did you try to hear the other side of the story. I assume no, as your political thoughts doesnt permit it.<br/>
Fourth, The deceased scholar hasnt done a brave stuff. Why didnt he fight against the system? Point is his he would have never known that after his suicide people like you and Khujliwaal will bake political rotis on this issue. Such a shame.<br/>
Last please think about the nation before you do such things. This doesnt potray a good picture.<br/><br/>

                            BJP are right! This is not a dalits vs non-dalits case. This is a dalits vs BJP case. BJP getting desperate to cover up the fact that they instigated the matter and were instrumental in his death. The proof is there for the world to see.

                            Very nicely articulated. Unfortunately the BJP gov't has been a big disappointment as most of the public has figured out in less than 2 years, that development is not on their mind only division. PM Modi will be a 1 term PM - we had so much high expectations.

                            Dear Derek. Boasting of knowing everything about the lives, activities and intentions of a person, after a two hour conversation with a few people is outrageous, probably immature. Please keep focus on West Bengal and make it a place for locals to live in peace.

                            seems students are misdirected from their aim, and finally they fall pray. This TMC or that Kejri or RaGa, will not listen as they are in election mood. advise to students, never join any community based association in educational institutes, for that matter anywhere in your lifetime. even if you think that it will protect you. do not do it. if you want to be a real scholar and help society, do social work. [if you clear out all the associations from educational institutes and ask these students to join social work like clearing water channels, planting trees, helping aged/orphaned/patients, I swear none of them will turn up. All are after money, and these politicians feed them enormously to fullfill their desires]

                            There is a difference between propaganda and spreading baseless  lies. Before the Bihar election, the Grand Alliance had setup an IT division and recruited a number of young professionals. Their job is to add comments for online news articles and spread nonsense through social media. They used fake names in all their comments. So the genuine comments by ordinary news readers went unnoticed. The same trend has started again and it is very sad that responsible political leaders are also spreading lies. The mercury will rise further as four state elections are nearing

I thought you were different, but you're the same rotten POS which most the people you share seat with in parliament are! You have no moral rights to question the conditions of Dalits, you are an elitist scum who is doing what is needed for the political mileage.

We may never know the truth in this case with so much political interference and efforts to blame the 'caste factors', but we should now let the police do its work without apportioning blame.

                            Shame on you Derek - did you ask <br/><br/>
why did Rohith and his friends attacked a fellow student? <br/><br/>
What if, if that student had committed suicide due to the shame and subjugation? <br/><br/>
Why did Rohith and his friends chose to oppose a criminal convicted by Supreme court of India?<br/><br/>
Do you know  Mr. Derek - merely posting something relating to Saddam Hussein, Osama, or ISIS can lead to removal of post on Facebook - Try that - and then Have you wondered why? reason is - when criminals are made heroes by innocent beings then emotions get flared up.<br/><br/>
This is why ABVP opposed the protest of ASA but peacefully - What did Rohith and his friends do - Assaulted a fellow student. <br/><br/>
WHO is the culprit here?<br/><br/>
For God's sake - do not misuse and draw mileage from a culprit's death.<br/><br/>
ROHITH's friends should be tried and charged for assault and inticing violence and flouting university norms. Anti - national activities - what would you call if a criminal is being painted as a hero&gt; indeed anti-national. If students are indeed worried about their education - study well - get good grades - stop playing politics over some criminal's conviction. In India, capital punishment is given in rarest of rare cases. YAKUB MENON deserved it. He evaded indian judicial system for 10 years and then kept sending 8 mercy and review petitions. ALL rejected. Have you seen Saudi Arabia - 43 executions in a day. Read about the past of capital punishment around the globe and then protest. ROHITH and his friends protest for a criminal YAKUB was and is an ANTI NATIONAL PROTEST.

From the news it appears suicided gentleman attacked another man for which he was punished. If Yakub means wife commit suicide will all the judges who has rejected his pleas will b charged For abatement.  Apparat did a similar action. It is unfortunate he had suicided but he did commit offence. Perhaps that pain forced him to end his life or .......... Life of Dalit or non Dalit is equal. If a Dalit get killed it become national issue. Otherwise ignored. Kejriwal enjoyed when farmer committed suicide in front of him. Hypocrisy.

In my view students body should focus only on student issues and improvement of facilities available to them instead of talking politics.

                            Once the news about the death of the student was heard  many reputed politicians of India did not take food. Immediately they spoke to their Friends to arrive at a consensus on How to deal with the shocking news. All of them agreed to rush to Hyderabad and console the friends in NEED!<br/>
They honestly requested everybody to keep the matter ABOVE POLITICS and in every word they uttered they used POLITICS. Perhaps what they wanted to avoid the INTERNAL POLITICS of the individual parties, where there is internal quota based on various categories for their internal Leadership!<br/>
Is there a political party in India who can even think above POLITICS?<br/>
Politics means "opportunism", "Fishing in Troubled waters", "Making hay while the sun shines", all means same thing! Otherwise how many parties sent UPPERCASTE representatives to Hyderabad to condole the demise of the student was CONFUSED rather DETERMINIED to end his life! Every politician is responsible for his death!

Because if one were to believe you then anything which is non TMC is wrong, bigoted and evil. So when Malda is burning what are you doing in Hyderabad...or is it expecting too much to expect you to be in your home state at the time of crisis especially when you can be in Hyderabad trying to whip up sentiments against the BJP.

Can you set one atrocity in your state or your constituency.<br/>
You and Mamata banerjee are a total failur.<br/>
You have the audacity  to pontificate on every issue.

                            It has become fashion to politicize deaths and only give one sided story for political score.<br/><br/>
Anything said by so called secularist, self claimed intellectuals is hard to believe , this is the impression they have created due to politics they play. This is sad as people do not know the real reason behind deaths.

                            Reading the title I thought Mr O Brien had something insightful to say but there is hardly any insight in what has written. Its easy enough to cry out intolerance and discrimination but have the Dalits studetn associations actually made any concret suggestions that will help improve the situation and give them a fighting chance. Does Mr O Brien or his party have any concrete suggestions. The way BJP uses political affiliations across campuses is no different from the way Congress used to do it or for that matter other political parties of West Bengal do. They made the mistake of leaving a paper trail that shows clear involvement of union ministers which either makes them look very stupid or very brazen in their approach. Its the latter that TV channels are trying to prove. But no amount of writing or talking on this issue is going to be helpful if the stakeholders dont talk of solution. And since no one is that is why this deep suspicion of mere politicization of a serious issue

                            The university politics is so vicious because the stakes are so small- Henry Kissinger

                            Derek WO Brain. Suicide on campus is normal as you do find people who are not having the will to live life as it presents itself. Dont make this what it is not. The student killed himself because he was a coward and ran away from life. Cowards should not occupy prime space in the news.
