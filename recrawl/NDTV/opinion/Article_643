Headline::::Why Modi Visit to Israel is Important for India



DateTime::::2015-06-03T14:40:00+05:30




                                In a historic first, Narendra Modi is set to visit Israel later this year. He will become the first prime minister of India to visit the country. Ahead of Modi's visit, External Affairs Minister, Sushma Swaraj will visit Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories.
Modi had visited Israel as chief minister of Gujarat in 2006. And as Indian Prime Minister, he had met his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly's annual session last year. Home Minister Rajnath Singh had visited Israel in November to boost counter-terror cooperation.
A hallmark of Modi's foreign policy has been a self-confident assertion of Indian interests. This is reflected in his government's moves vis-a-vis Israel, marking a distinct break from unnecessary and counterproductive diffidence of the past. Despite sharing 23 years of diplomatic ties and working closely on defence, counter-terrorism, agriculture and energy related issues, no Indian Prime Minister or President has ever visited Israel.
When it comes to India's Israel policy, hypocrisy has been the norm. Just last year, Israel's actions in Gaza were deemed so unacceptable by Indian parliamentarians that all perspective was lost. Calling for suspension of military purchases from Israel, the CPI-M's Sitaram Yechury had suggested that "India cannot be a party to this genocide."
Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad demanded that the Rajya Sabha pass a resolution condemning the attacks and hit out at the government saying it was regrettable that New Delhi did not raise its voice against the "massacre". Ahmed Hassan of the Trinamool Congress wanted India to raise the issue at the United Nations, and CPI's D Raja called for a "categorical stand condemning Israel."
Despite representing a nation that is one of the biggest victims of cross-border terrorism in the world, our esteemed members of Parliament have had no compunction in equating the actions of a liberal democratic Israel with the murderous extremism of a terrorist organisation such as Hamas.
Couched in the humanitarian concern for the plight of Gaza residents, the opposition did its best to play to the gallery, insinuating that because of the BJP government, religious motives cannot be far behind. In her reply, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had done well to remind her opposition colleagues that India's relations with Palestine and Israel were a legacy of previous governments, including the Congress-led UPA government of the recent past.
There has been a steady strengthening of India's relationship with Israel ever since the two established full diplomatic relations in 1992. It is a tribute to Narasimha Rao's foresight that he was able to lay the basis of Indo-Israeli partnership. In contrast to the back-channel security ties that existed before the normalisation of bilateral relations, India has been more willing in recent years to carve out a mutually beneficial bilateral relationship with Israel, including deepening military ties and countering the threat terrorism poses to the two societies.
Over the years, the Indian government has also toned down its reactions to Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. India has also begun denouncing Palestinian suicide bombings and other terrorist acts in Israel, something that was seen earlier as rather justified in light of the Israeli policies against the Palestinians. India is no longer initiating anti-Israel resolutions at the UN and has made serious attempts to moderate NAM's anti-Israel resolutions.
This re-evaluation has been based on a realisation that India's largely pro-Arab stance in the Middle East has not been adequately rewarded by the Arab world. India has received no worthwhile backing from the Arab countries in the resolution of problems it faces in its neighbourhood, especially Kashmir. There have been no serious attempts by the Arab world to put pressure on Pakistan to reign in cross-border insurgency in Kashmir.
On the contrary, the Arab nations have firmly stood by Pakistan, using the Organisation of Islamic Conference to build support for Islamabad and the jihadi groups in Kashmir. If Arab nations, such as Jordan, have been able to keep their traditional ties with Palestine intact while building a new relationship with Israel, there is no reason for India not to take a similar route, which might give it more room for diplomatic manoeuvring.
Keeping India's wider strategic interests in perspective, successive Indian governments since the early 1990s have walked a nuanced line between expressing genuine concern for the Palestinian cause and expanding its commercial and defence ties with Israel. India is the world's largest buyer of Israeli weaponry and was Israel's third largest trading partner in Asia in 2013, just after China and Hong Kong.
The domestic political milieu continues to exert its substantial influence on the trajectory of India-Israel relations. Israel has been a good friend of India but New Delhi continues to be shy of demonstrating its friendship. At crucial times, when India needed Israeli help, it got it unreservedly. Israel was willing to continue and even step up its arms sales to India after other major states curbed their technological exports following India's May 1998 nuclear tests.
Israel provided India with much-needed imagery of Pakistani positions using its UAVs during the Kargil War in 1999, which was instrumental in turning the war around for India. When India was planning to undertake a limited military strike against Pakistan in June 2002 as part of "Operation Parakram," Israel supplied hardware through special planes. The terrorism that both India and Israel face comes not only from disaffected groups within their territories; it is also aided and abetted by neighbouring states, increasingly capable of transferring weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organisations.
And yet previous governments had been reticent in acknowledging Israel's partnership. In diplomacy, public affirmation of friendships at the highest levels is often as important as drawing red lines for adversaries. The Modi government is doing well by repudiating the discredited Israel policy of its predecessors. An open relationship with Israel serves India well and it's about time Tel Aviv gets the recognition it deserves from New Delhi.Harsh V.

                            About time India opened up to Israel. Israel has been a major supplier of defence equipment and also an ally against pakistan. Also the Israeli system of agriculture and drip irrigation is extremely efficient and can be useful for India's agriculture..

                            Very nicely articulated and well researched article.<br/>
It's very interesting observation that India kept romancing the arab world even when we never received any reciprocal love from our arab friends. It's irrational but obvious as to why a certain party ruling the country did that. but what's more unfortunate is that our people never really had (and they still don't have) any problems with such dirty politics where national interests took a back seat only to please a certain section of minority, which minority was also never benefited by such stupid acts of our parliamentarians.<br/>
I am constantly surprised by the fact that our people continue to buy lies of certain political parties that have ruled the nation for such a long time and still expect the current government to change everything for good in one year. A classic strategy to increase the expectations and tell people that Look They Are No Better Than Us; we at least keep sprinkling some crumbs for you to lick and stay stupid and irrational. <br/>
It's great to see the current government flexing India's muscles and taking smart decisions in international politics to keep every country guessing as to which side India is on only to realise that this government is on the side of its citizens and no brotherhood or group. I wish this was done a long time ago and I would appreciate if successive governments (regardless of party) continue to follow an objective and rational external affairs policy.

It's methods may be questioned, but to survive against such odds and hatred, it has to act with a heavy hand. Too bad that the same people have a soft spot for those harming innocent unsuspecting civilians. There is no reason to hide our ties with Israel.

                            Excuse me? Is the writer implying Israel has a halo, and that it has been a victim all along? And that the forcible settlements in Palestine land is justified? The entire world, including their good friend the USA is fed up with Israeli hard headed ness. That India should develop good relations with Israel is without a shadow of doubt. But that does not mean India should look the other way at Israel's misdeeds. In fact, it should use this friendship to try and resolve the Palestine issue. But it is doubtful it will overcome Israel's stubbornness.

                            What do you mean mr harsh when you say - "actions of a liberal democratic Israel with the murderous extremism of a terrorist organisation such as Hamas." Blowing up kids with 35 caliber guns, spectators watching while civilians are being bombed and clapping as they hear a bomb explode.- is this not murderous? Israelites believe their race is superioir over all other human beings.  There is no sin upon them no matter what they do. Thats why for them it is so easy to kill. . During Kargil war, Israel sold us ammunition at 3 times the price.

                            The "actions of a liberal democratic Israel" put forth by the writer above also includes:<br/><br/>
# IDF snipers shooting innocent Palestinian children playing on the streets. And no, they are not human barriers.<br/>
# Israeli police force evacuating Palestinians from their own homes.<br/>
# Isreali police beating and torturing old aged civilians.<br/>
# Aparthied policy of Israeli government disallowing commoners from travelling with Jews on public commutes.<br/>
# Treatment of Ethiopian Jews or the Black Jews by Israeli government as second class citizens, limited to being construction workers.<br/>
# Promoting hostility and violence in all its neighbouring countries.<br/>
# Construction of Aparthied wall to secure Israelis while Palestinians are chased off their lands.<br/><br/>
All of the above are few of the human rights violations by the Zionist regime of Israel. And the above cannot be justified as mere actions of providing security to its citizens. Over 80% of the current population in Israel are not descendants of the Jews who resided in Palestine. They are the ones who were flown in from different parts of the world to live under the name of Israel, by displacing its original inhabitants. The writer here seems to be less knowledgable of their history.<br/><br/>
Our reasoning to engage positively with Israel only for arms is just a sign of our limitations in research and development inspite of having so many IITians and scientists in the country. Yet we go for the easy way out to buy "solutions" from the greatest human rights violator country in the world.

                            I agree with Pant that this visit is important for India, however it is strange he as a journalist terming Hamas as terrorist. Modi is good in assessing the situation of the Middle east and he going to Israel while ignoring the GCC and Arab nations; who are in my opinion doing nothing but fighting with each other, so are they worth any attention? However if Modi thinks that he has high regard for the American Desis and not the Labor class NRIs of the Gulf then he may think again and find an approach. I would also really appreciate is Modi spends some time with the Ghaza residents to give them confidence and mutual understanding and a human touch.

                            and of course the author is importantly missed out- important arab nations including saudi, qatar,egypt, uae etc themselves have gone against Hamas which is backed by Iran.Currently there is an ongoing crackdown on the muslim brotherhood/hamas elements. egypt has gone a bit further by destroying smuggling tunnels across its border and  throing them into jails. Hence, this time around, no arab nation will cry foul when the PM visits Israel.
