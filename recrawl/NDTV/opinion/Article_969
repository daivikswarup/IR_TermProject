Headline::::Gandhi's Agenda Of Prohibition Created Dawood Ibrahim



DateTime::::2015-12-30T15:43:00+05:30




                                I have been a lifelong admirer of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, although the reasons for the admiration have changed over time. He was a great political strategist and tactician and one who simultaneously amalgamated moral integrity, popular proclivities and pragmatic politics to overthrow British colonial rule.
His views on spirituality, relationships, personal habits and economics are less admirable. They ought not to have mattered, but for their being upheld as norms for everyone else, and for Indian society at large. It is possible to respect Gandhi without respecting most aspects of Gandhism.
Gandhism has had many unintended consequences that have harmed Indian society. The most egregious example of this is how Gandhian values created Dawood Ibrahim. Yes, you read that right. There is a causal link between Gandhian values and the dons of the underworld.
Consider. Gandhi was a strong proponent of total prohibition. This became part of the agenda of the Indian National Congress and made its way into the Constitution, as a Directive Principle calling upon the Republic of India to "endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption except for medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks..."
Morarji Desai, an ardent disciple of Gandhi, became Home Minister and, later, Chief Minister of Bombay State. He duly ordered restaurants closed at midnight, banned kissing scenes in films and introduced prohibition.
In Dongri to Dubai, a gripping account of the Mumbai underworld, Hussain Zaidi writes, "With such imposition in place, the mafia had a brilliant opportunity to increase their profits-provide the illegal goods not available to interested customers at exorbitant prices. This was the time when [Shaikh Mohammed Al] Ghalib and [Haji] Mastan came into their full form. Within months of the imposition, they started raking in money....the ban, especially of liquor, only provided licence to a growing illicit liquor trade. This trade required brawn and this proved to be the first turning point in the life of Varadarajan Mudaliar."
Once they established themselves, the organised crime syndicates of Mumbai expanded into other areas, creating a number of gang leaders, including in the 1980s, a young man called Dawood Ibrahim. (By the way, Haji Mastan and Karim Lala were detained by Indira Gandhi's Emergency government. They were subsequently released by the government of Prime Minister, er, Morarji Desai. History is like this, sometimes.)
It stands to reason that prohibition was an important reason behind the growth of the underworld and, ultimately, the rise of characters like Dawood Ibrahim.
Unfortunately, governments after Morarji Desai have either not learned the lesson from his puritanical zeal or decided that moral corruption of society is the price they are willing to pay to tackle the problem of alcoholism. Yes, prohibition not only fails to tackle alcoholism, but promotes corruption, greater criminality and erodes moral values of society.
Think about it. Just because the government bans alcohol, the demand doesn't go away. Only the supply falls into the hands of unscrupulous entrepreneurs. Once the industry goes underground, neither government nor society can regulate it or tax it. This means the risk of spurious and dangerous alcohol goes up, especially for the poor who can't afford expensive smuggled bottles of liquor. Also people tend to drink more when they get the opportunity, exacerbating the problem of alcoholism. There is abundant evidence for this around the world.
Worse, the illicit producers of alcohol will offer bribes to law enforcement officials and politicians, creating a vicious cycle of corruption. This will create the conditions for gangs to expand into other areas of activity - from film production to real estate, from fast food to narcotics, raising the levels of criminality. Worst of all, gang leaders, corrupt officials and violent criminals will become role models for impressionable young people as they see such people rise in wealth and social status. I am not indulging in hypothesis. I am explaining Mumbai and many other cities in our country where bans on economic activity have resulted in massive social problems that we are unwilling to acknowledge.
We can cite Gandhi, allude to the Directive Principles, and cite the problem of alcoholism to argue that prohibition is a good thing (especially for the poor, not the rest of us). That is what the Supreme Court done by upholding the Kerala government's decision to impose prohibition in the state. This means the 700 bars that the government closed down will continue to remain shut and government-run liquor retail stores will close down (curiously) at the rate of 10 percent a year. In a state which consumes 200 ml of alcohol per person per week, only 27 five-star hotel bars will serve drinks.
As happened elsewhere in the world, the demand won't change much. Only the suppliers will change. We can reliably expect criminal gangs to move into alcohol distilling, smuggling and retailing. We can expect bribes to flow to police, excise officials and politicians. It's not as if the Supreme Court does not know this. In fact, in its judgement, the bench acknowledges that "History has painstakingly made it abundantly clear that prohibition has not succeeded." Amazingly, it then goes on to say, "Therefore strict state regulation is imperative." It is inexplicable why the bench feels that the Kerala government will be capable of overturning the painstaking lessons of history.
Bihar and Tamil Nadu are also toying with the same bad idea. Prohibition does not work. It is far better to allow the production, sale and consumption of alcohol, regulating for safety and taxing to cover the costs of tackling alcoholism. Politicians contemplating prohibition can think of setting up a fund to tackle the problems of alcoholism, and finance it with liquor taxes.
Gandhi would perhaps have changed his mind if confronted with the evidence we have now.(Nitin Pai is director of the Takshashila Institution, a think tank and school of public policy. These are his personal views.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            The writer and some of the comments cannot be more wrong. PROHIBITION WORKS; it does reduce alcohol consumption and I have personally seen this in Gujarat, where growing up meant hardly any exposure to alcohol consumption. Being illegal meant it was not available on every street corner like it is in many cities. By and large the general population does not get access to alcohol. You do not have drunks on streets and no incidences of drunk driving. I agree enforcement could be better, but that does not mean the policy is wrong. How many Gujaratis can regularly go to Maharashtra or Rajasthan to get their drink. Most law abiding citizens will also not try to get illegal alcohol. There will certainly be a small section of people who are willing to break laws for their drink and they will do that. Better enforcement will reduce even that. <br/>
Law enforcement agencies cannot prevent murders being committed in any society, does that mean that we should legalize murder and violence? This is the logic that so many people seem to be giving against prohibition.

                            Absolutely, spot on. This is true. Whenever, you try to suppress a desire, it gives way to crime. Be it spurious supply or supply which is illegal, in turn it breeds corruption. The menace soon spreads like a cancer to other areas. Ways are devised to earn from a normal transaction. <br/><br/>

                            The Indian Constitution, which incidently was drafted by well-off professionals and bureaucrats and passed of as representing "we the people of India", has no elements of Gandhian thought in it. When a few individuals protested this in the Constituent Assembly debates, as an after-thought some Gandhian ideals were incorporated (reluctantly) in the Directive Principles by the Drafting committee. None of those Directive Principles have been implemented in any serious manner, as the country has been constantly trying to ape Western ideas of 'development' and 'liberalism'. And, even when a late attempt is made by one State to implement one of the Directive Principles, we have shallow intellectuals (like this Nitin Pai) immediately crying hoarse with highly twisted arguments and perverted logic!

                            The argument about illicit liquor  is a very old one used by the opponents of Prohibition in this country except that the author  has given a new (un)holy twist by using the Mahatma's name. It is amazing how one can have such a condescending ‘admiration' for the Mahatma. HEY RAM!  <br/>
The author is the Director of Public policy institute and he seems to have employed  all his knowledge  and resources to  conclude that Prohibition will fail  because of   criminals and corrupt law enforcement officers .   Does he realize  that in the process he is actually justifying/ rationalizing  criminals and corruption.  When the public discourse in this country and opinion of young people  in this country is so overwhelmingly in favour of  rooting  out  corruption  and criminals  in public life , public policy research efforts should be  directed  towards  finding  ideas and measures  to achieve the same.  Instead  he has  labored to trash a good  and courageous policy decision  taken against a  social evil .<br/><br/>
Sir,  for heavens sake,   step out of your ivory tower and try to understand   the anguish of  millions of women, children and  ordinary citizens of this country who have been the victims of the free flow of liquor in our streets. The governments who have taken the decision have heeded to these anguished voices  and the last thing  they need is   the specious arguments  from experts(!) like you. <br/>
And Please, Please, Please Donot denigrate the Mahatma.

                            @:@Anonymous: I fully agree with those who have seen the good effects of prohibition and the bad effects of free sales of liquor.<br/><br/>
To say that prohibition creates a mafia is to ignore the fact that liquor sellers in on prohibition states like Karnataka form a far bigger mafia.They not only have to pay massive bribes to politicians to get their licenses, but to also have to pay the police huge sums every single month to stay open. <br/><br/>
And how to evaluate the cost of so many people becoming criminal due to alcohol consumption? Rape, murder, armed robbery are most often committed by people who aredrunk, or in need of money to support their liquor habit. Let's not even start talking of wife beatings, rapes of intoxicated young girls, and endless accidents caused by drunk driving.<br/><br/>
So many people will  not drink if i is not easily available in every corner. Public limited companies entertainment bills will drastically fall. Worker absenteeism will fall.<br/><br/>
Even if prohibition is only 25% successful, it would be a massive gain for society.<br/><br/>
So - congratulations to the activists of Kerala for forcing a reluctant Congress party to implement prohibition. Congratulations to Bihar, and I hope Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and other states follow suit soon.I have no hope for Karnataka, because the money flow to crooked and powerful people is too large for them to contemplate giving it up... they are going to increase the number of outlets massively.

Your analytical mind has scored self Goal. Your long article sums up in one phrase " Encourage rapes for the fear of birth of rapist". Circles of Guards against evil to individual are Personal controls, Family restrictions, Social restrictions,  Local law, State Law, Country Law and international law. In the case under discussion, harm to individual has become life threat specially for women due to porous guarding circles at each level. Porosity was more in the guarding circles of international law (protection to lawless in foreign countries , in the name of religion). State sponsored damage to moral education had broken the Family and social guarding circles.<br/><br/>
Intellectuals like you should not live like observer alone. Own more responsibility and come up with solution to the problem faced by young children and women. In my opinion, you should join me for moral education. <br/><br/>
Idiotic quest of pleasure by drinking is never satiated by opening up prohibition. Idiotic quest still chases the pleasure in brands and increased frequency,  costing fortunes of the country. So-called under world threat does not come from liquor alone, it comes from any goods or  service. What do you say for fake currency ? fire arms ? killing female child ? child labour? Porn ? list is endless.

                            The trade off is between legal availability, with attendant legitimacy, and illegal availability with the attendant corruption. Gujarat is an example. Alcohol is available, pretty easily, in the state, but no public exhibition of drunkenness. Hooch tragedies, corruption are prevalent. Families also get ruined, but perhaps, statistically, less significant in number.  It is a trade off that the society makes with the help of the government of the day. Drinking is unlikely to vanish.

Since I am about to say offensive to many, Apologies before hand and I do respect and love my mother.<br/><br/>
Many points to answer his logic-less article.<br/>
1) with that logic, many mothers have made mistake by giving birth to all these. First Mother who gave birth so this article came into existence, second so Gandhi came third so Dawood appeared into world forth myself fifth you all are who is reading and writing over here. Oh! Come on.<br/><br/>
2) By that logic, Why do we force people to fasten their seat belt. It's their life, do they not have right to choose. All drivers are adult so can they not make their own decision.<br/><br/>
3) By that logic, Why ban anything at all. If Gujarat government allows heroine the drug, Cocaine, marijuana or any narcotics, it will flourish their economy then anything.<br/><br/>
4) By that logic, Why ban prostitution? On other side, Government should make prostitution legal and amend constitution to give that as basic right. Government should start legalized brothel, club for free for under 18 and subsidized for over 18. If this happens then there will be rap and crime against woman. Anytime anyone feel, just call toll free number and woman/man is there for free or subsidized rate. Are you kidding me??<br/><br/>
What logic drives this article???

                            Mr Nitin Pai has to read closely the original of My Experiments in Truth to understand Gandhi.His approach to Gandhi is too superfluous to make any significant meaning. Gandhi was just &amp; too an ordinary person with all possible frailties of any human being. He admitted all these openly in his autobiography. Only the life in South Africa made a rebel of him. He was against liquor consumption in India as he saw that it ruined the poor all the way &amp; the women were practically nowhere because of it. He never opposed liquor consumption per se when he was in England or South Africa. Both Sudheendran &amp; Nitish Kumar have undertaken in favour of prohibition only for the good of the women of their states.

                            True. Gandhi preached prohibition. And several state governments, notably Gujarat, have implemented it with varying degrees of success. But just because it fuels an illegal market is not a good reason to condemn prohibition. The state has to try for the good of the citizens. It is for the citizens to make a success of any policy. Remember that states introducing prohibition also stand to lose revenues. Therefore the prohibition policy also costs the states heavily, and yet they go ahead with it for valid reasons.

That old man fought for wrong generations to come... may be you and I should also have experienced little bit of pre-independence days..<br/><br/>
Gujarat: Yes liquor is available illegally.. May be they drink more than others... The difference:- You will not see drunks on roads, criminals in open... The one big crime in gujarat is to somehow get liquor and consume it secretly.. so they get it and drink it and feel satisfied of liquor as well as committing the "heinous crime" of procuring liquor illegally... When there is no prohibition, driniking anywhere is not crime... so crime moves one step further and you know what that means, dont you? By the way, kuch din to gujaro Gujarat mein...

In fact, the prime place should have been given to Subhas Bose, Bhagat Singh &amp; Chandrashekar Azad. If Word War II had not taken place, we would have been free only in 2000's.

                            This is the most childish Indian minded logic! Gandhi was not a parliamentarian - he was a social reformer. His messages was to the people to enhance their lives. The law makers don't have only the prohibition as a tool - they also have the police as a tool. They failed to provide legal force to the implementation of prohibition - a lack of administrative capability. We failed Gandhi not vice versa. In 1947 India should have gone the Communist way for the next 60 years and implemented strict rules which would have taken us quite far out of social, religious, political and economic garbage we are living in now. New Delhi is a few hundred km from Bakhara Nangal Dam but there is water black market! China has electricity, roads, hospitals, One language, control on population, and a vibrant economy to the edge of the world - TIBET. India has freedom for garbage journalism. To blame Gandhi for ones failure is like taking a fight with his goat. Bmhaaeee!!!

It is the politicians, police and the unholy gangs which provided protection and cover for Dawood Ibrahim and the likes of  him. Nitin Pai or Nitin Bhai would then probably also profess that prostitution is rampant in the Country because of Gandhi. It is more like "intolerance" stories of Khans.

                            Prohibition is nothing but a political gimmick.<br/>
But to point at Gandhi's views on prohibition and therefore Dawood, is a bit rich.<br/>
There will be Dawoods always. With Gandhis or without.<br/><br/>
Coming back to prohibition.<br/>
The US went to the extent of poisoning industrial alcohol during prohibition.<br/>
To prevent people from patronising bootleggers.<br/>
The result? Over 10,000 Americans died.<br/><br/>
AK Antony banned arrack, the poor man's drink, in Kerala.<br/>
The result?<br/>
1. Hooch-deaths.<br/>
2. The arrack-drinker started buying IMFL.<br/>
Thus impacting his family's resources ever more.<br/>
Now, it's available only in 5-star hotels and govt. liquor shops.<br/>
It really is interesting to visit 5-star bars, these days.<br/><br/>
Gujarat?<br/>
Prohibition keeps a bootlegging alive and healthy.<br/><br/>
Andhra? Failed.<br/>
Mizoram? Failed.<br/><br/>
Taxing it more is also not going to work.<br/>
It just makes families impacted by alcoholism, poorer.

                            Dear Nitin,<br/>
Well said and written. You have hit the nail. Today what we see around us is the direct result of under world activities by the criminals. The rot has taken roots in all spheres of our daily life. The value system has changed. The bad breed has spread in all directions. Executive, administrative and judicial systems have been effected. There are no moral principals. <br/>
Well done for high lighting the root cause.<br/>
Thank you.<br/>

                            Unless an individual concerned take oath and get away from such addiction,no law can succeed. Banning of liquor is a stupidity and in a state like Bihar where corruption is high in every section of the society. Police,Govt. officials and politicians will mint money. Illicit liquor will rule the roost. Nitish Kumar wants to score over Lalu Yadav and for that he is experimenting in cheap adventure. Which Bihari ministers are not drinking and chewing kaini(raw tobacco). As regards Ms. Jayalalitha is sensible and will not indulge in such stupidity.

                            Hi,<br/>
100% agree with your views. Let me give another statistics from another country. The great USA. In 70s and 80s drug consumption increased to historical highs. To tackle this, both republican and democrats played with emotions of people who were affected and not on rationality, wrote laws which criminalised not only drug trafficking but also drug consumption. Effectively, USA today has world's highest jailed people in the world. (Jail maintenance activities are privatised also creating more wealthy people). (16 lakh people are jailed in USA due to drug related offences). Now after 30 years, majority of people and effectively politicians are started legalizing drug consumption in some states. (This will cover all of USA in future according to me.).<br/><br/>
My point is, the USA with reasonable uncorrupting police force themselves are not able to fight drugs, understand what will happen in India with majority of our police force are corrupt).<br/><br/>
Lastly, a Machivilian idea. Don't dream of a morally superior society. It never existed. It never will exist even in future.<br/><br/>
Let us understand the complications and arrive at a conclusion that there will be some people who will be affected by any, so called immoral activity (Drug, Alcohol, Prostitution). If you try to stop it. You will not only fail, but will affect more people than intended. <br/><br/>
Live in real world.<br/><br/>

                            You are absolutely right, Nitin. Unfortunately, people think banning something or gagging an idea means it's gone. Sadly, it comes back in more vicious forms. We need to tax liquor and use those funds towards addressing alcoholism. Remember alcohol and alcoholism are two different things.

First, labor across India will be at least as disciplined as Gujarati labor.<br/>
Second, industrial growth of rest of India will match that of Gujarat.<br/>
Third, liquor will be needed to be smuggled across international borders.<br/>
At least 66% positive, isn't it?

                            With great respect to Gandhi while he was alive he was confronted with great number of evidences on issues of those times but he refused to change, he was extremely stubborn and some say politically very sharp, that he would do a somersault is not typical of MK Gandhi, his immediate family had to bear the brunt of his stubborn attitude. Prohibition, politicians believe, makes a great way to grab votes often with disastrous consequences of the type that the writer has correctly referred to.

                            as a lover of marijuana i would just like to share the story if iduki gold or idukki gold and make a analogy with booze ban. This is the famous strain of marijuana  which was grown in kerala alongs the hills of idduki. second only to the weed from beas and parvati.<br/><br/>
I also have some keralite friends and they used to swear by its high. Some years ago "Ol'man chandy had a farm" decided to eradicate marijuana from the state of kerala. Kerala has rich past of cultivation and consumption of ganja.<br/><br/>
I visited Kerala earlier this year and could not score even a spliffs worth of weed in 15 days. The Idduki gold strain has vanished of the planet earth. The kerala admin has come down hard on it. They went to jungles and destroyed any grow they found. inside those thick rain forests. imagine. I have heard accounts of police visiting homes to destroy a single plant which may be growing as a weed.<br/><br/>
You can not find any indigenous marijuana in kerala. none. open market or black market.<br/><br/>
My point being: if kerala govt wants, it can very well do it and there will be no blackmarket / underground just like in the case of marijuana. You have to understand kerala is different / better from rest of the country. look at their clean rivers, their conservation of resources and protection of heritage. Their planning of public services. just see their public transport and well laid out and organized bus stands. These people do it better.<br/><br/>
I am not mallu. i live in pune and have been to delhi, punjab, himachal,  assam, goa, kerala, haryana, UP, Uttarkhand , J&amp;K. <br/>
You would be unfair if you compare kerala to any other state. if kerala govt wants it can have a liquor free state without the blackmarket.

                            This observation is totally absurd. Prohibition is a verygood policy. While implementing any rule imposing social morality and discipline, such anti social counter moves will normally come. Is it right to relax everything including brathel to disband dadas and kangaroo's courts? This article is fully incorrect and illogical. This intends to belittle Gandhiji for obvious reasons. Sorry.

                            Totally agree on the consequence of alcohol prohibition in current time context, but fundamentally disagree on your opinion about Gandhi's idea of total prohibition is somewhat not inline with the time of the call. Per se, Gandhi or Gandhism is last one to be blamed. At that time of mass awareness, Gandhi's call on banning alcohol was a successful agenda, that united the illiterate countrymen to the mainstream of opposition to British-rule. The execution of the prohibition call had been volunteered by the then intellectual mass in the form of educating the comparatively less privileged community. But where as during the self ruled state the elected law makers took a break from the hard work of freedom fighting and considered execution is any rule as such is a easy task among the newly independent Country. And that assumption along with personal interests of the policy-makers became a serious consequence in the form of promoting a third class society which was missed from the vision of the preachers of non-violent activism. So my point is Gandhi whose only ideology of getting the SWARAJ to the country at that crucial; point in time should not be dragged into the debate of lack of his vision towards spirituality, relationships, personal habits and economics. It was the job of the other leaders who actually reaped the advantage of his sincerity to the nation to fulfill many dreams that have been viewed during the Civil Disobedience movement of 1930, Satyagrah, Padyatra, Harijan awareness that made him Mahatma the great soul.

                            Education against consuming liquor, warnings and more taxes on Liquor will reduce the consumption. Well consuming little liquor is not bad in real. So why ban ? Instead make it costly drink.

From thee on the more ruthless  Irish , South American cartels dealing in canabis, cocian and now synthetic drugs. The Talban and likewise groups financing their terror through illegal sales of banned substances which are highly addictive and lethal.Banning of alcohol leads to ruthless crime syndicates,corruption and misery to the poor

For youth it is no more exciting to take drug. Europe the government and Police would become corrupt the day they introduce prohibition. USA is still fighting organized criminality which was created during prohibition. Here I clearly see a hidden political greed presented with Godly arguments.

                            Prohibition is a sure shot way of raising illegal money, and fast. The Congress now in just two states - Karnataka and Kerala, they have to do the fund raising from somewhere. Karnataka is at a saturation point in terms of political extortion. Where else? Kerala, without industry, won't cut it. Thus, this out of the box solution. Wreck the state's finances, raise money for the party.<br/><br/>
