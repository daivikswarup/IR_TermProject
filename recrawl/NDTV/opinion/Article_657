Headline::::Modi vs Kejriwal: the Chief Minister is Ahead



DateTime::::2015-06-17T04:57:00+05:30




                                There's a nice symmetry to the way in which the Aam Aadmi Party's leadership loses people. Its most plausible metropolitan members are purged from within by Arvind Kejriwal while its most brutish stalwarts are disabled from without by angry policemen or estranged spouses. The loss of its most cultivated members is balanced out by the loss of its coarsest, and in this way, a happy equilibrium is found.
During these periodic ructions partisan critics gloat, bien pensant fellow-travellers despair while the AAP explores new ways of being insurgent. The last mentioned isn't hard; the central government, maddened by the Delhi elections is rampaging about doing its rogue elephant routine. The plan - shackled as we are to political reason, we have to look for a plan - must be to show Delhi's voters that the man they made chief minister via an electoral avalanche, is just a gelded mayor, constitutionally disbarred from picking his nose without the central government's permission.
Delhi's voters knew that the Delhi government doesn't control the city's police; they now know through a notification issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs that it doesn't run the civil service either. The BJP's plan seems to be that if the AAP can be shown to be impotent, voters, both in Delhi and elsewhere, will come to think of the Delhi election as a bad bet and turn to the politically virile alternative: Narendra Modi and the BJP.
The legal cover for the Modi government's exercise in AAP-baiting is derived from a contested reading of the National Capital Region of Delhi Act (1991) and Article 239 AA of the Constitution which together laid the legislative groundwork for the establishment of the Delhi Assembly. The Act withheld certain powers which are normally the prerogative of state governments and vested them in the central government.
The Home ministry claims that public services, hitherto seen as the Delhi Government's domain, fall under the jurisdiction of the central government. Invoking this reading of the law to hamstring the Delhi government and provoke Kejriwal into indiscretion must have seemed a sharp scheme to Messrs Modi & Shah, still hurting as they were from February's rout, but it really isn't.
It makes no political sense to pit a nominated constitutional functionary against the largest electoral majority that Delhi (or for that matter any state assembly) has ever seen. There is no rhetorical mileage to be had from it. Or there is but only for Kejriwal; for him, this stand-off is the gift that keeps on giving. The Yadav-Bhushan purge, the dodgy law minister, the incorrigibly unattractive Somnath Bharti, these blots that keep threatening to reduce Kejriwal & Co to machine politicians are dry-cleaned into a snowy whiteness by this ongoing spectacle: plucky David assaulted by that prince of bad losers, Goliath.
The division of executive powers at the state assembly level has a particular colonial history. Once the electoral principle was conceded by the British Raj early in the twentieth century, it was anxious to ensure that provincial governments weren't hijacked by upstart Indian netas intoxicated by electoral success. One way of doing this was by making crucial administrative and law and order functions the prerogative of unelected civil servants who answered to the colonial government, not Indian electorates.
This pre-emptive division of powers where civil servants exercised authoritarian control over the sinews of government - police, justice, law and order and land revenue - while elected desis pottered about looking after 'soft' portfolios like sanitation and education, was formalised by the Government of India Act of 1919 into a system that is described in history textbooks as 'dyarchy'. It was a system detested by Indian politicians as a mockery of responsible government and in 1935, a new colonial constitution abolished 'reserved' subjects and transferred complete control over provincial administration to wholly elected provincial governments.
The strangeness of trying to reprise a quasi-colonial dyarchy in a republican democracy has been obvious ever since the current avatar of the Delhi Assembly was constituted in 1992. There is a reason why every political party in Delhi, including the BJP, has demanded full statehood including control over the police and the bureaucracy. Had Delhi not been granted an assembly and had the capital city been run in a frankly unrepresentative way as Washington is, the question of self-government might never have arisen, but that ship has sailed.
There is a reasonable case to be made for creating safeguards that prevent Delhi's governments from encroaching upon the central government's freedom of action in the nation's capital, but on any reasonable view, these fall well short of the sweeping control over the city's land, police and bureaucracy that is currently claimed by the union government.
The Aam Aadmi Party is perfectly placed to make the democratic case for full self-government. It has a massive popular mandate, a limitless appetite for confrontational face-offs - its political stock-in-trade - and a populist agenda that it can plausibly claim is being thwarted not by an inability to govern, but the obstructionist hostility of a union government which refuses to acknowledge an elected government's political remit.
So long as Arvind Kejriwal isn't provoked into a dharna on Rajpath or a quixotic resignation, there is no downside for the Aam Aadmi Party in this game of chicken. The cost to the BJP could be substantial. For one, it seems to have written off Delhi, once a BJP stronghold, as an electoral arena. When Nalin Kohli, the spokesperson of a party once committed to full statehood for Delhi, derides Delhi's newly elected chief minister as a 'glorified municipal commissioner', you know that the BJP's pique has gotten the better of its sense of political self-preservation.
Mr Modi's commitment to cooperative federalism seems not to extend to chief ministers who best him in electoral contests. No one who lived through Delhi's election campaign is likely to forget that Mr Modi literally put his face on the line... and lost. Now, his government seems to be bent on smothering the political infant birthed by that election in its crib.
Public vindictiveness is a charmless trait in a political party. We have to assume that the BJP's leadership has a reason for declaring open season on AAP, but for anyone but party diehards, the optics of this are awful.Mukul Kesavan is a writer based in Delhi.

                            How can you even compare Modi with Arvind? Are you coming to say that 49 days + 100 days are good enough to judge well a person, that too in politics and that too in a country like India. You guys try to be an intellectual but fail to produce, when you don't even find a single digit logic in your journalism. Do you come to say that Delhi statehood was Kejriwal's plan? Then why didn't he mention it in his election manifesto? I dont think he is such a visionary leader. He is honest man but immature politician. As simple as that..

                            Kesavan is comparing a leader with a track record of winning 3 consecutive elections in Gujarat with Kejriwal who has one 2 consecutive elections in Delhi. Kejriwal should now have another mid term election and make it 3 all. It's no more 5 saal Kejriwal. It's 3 all Kejriwal. Forget the forged certificates, sex maniacs who sleep with student volunteers and wife beaters. It's all allegations. AAP is still a clean party! Also Kejriwal has now put a case on his own administration for power hikes. Ultimately the Judge will hear arguments from both of his lawyers and pass a power hike verdict and Kejriwal will promptly follow court orders in a democracy. It's a very clean image party!

                            What the hell has Modi to do anything with running against Kejriwal. He is PM of country and Kejri is just a Dharne baaj, incompetent Politician. Kejri and AAP writers are like Rakhi Sawant, just compare yourself to higher ups and blame them for where you are.  <br/><br/>
Mr. Mukul Kesavan, since you like to make farcical comparisons, please also write a article about:<br/><br/>
"Obama vs Kejriwal: the Chief Minister is Ahead" and <br/><br/>

                            Kejriwal's mistake was that he should not have opted for political power. Perennial agitators like him can never be effective administrators. There are many examples. Anna Hazare, JP, and the greatest of them all, Mahatma Gandhi. Once you have power you lose the moral high ground. When so many in his own party show feet of clay, how can he tell others to be honest? And the controversy a day schedule does not improve administration in any way. Remember, you campaign in poetry, but govern in prose. To compare Modi and Kejriwal is downright ridiculous. Modi was an extremely successful CM of an important state like Gujarat for 13 years before he won the national elections single handed by a landslide. By comparison Kejriwal is still a babe in the woods who is yet to make an impact with his administration. No CM can be compared with the PM on any parameter. Especially with a PM as overpowering as Modi. The comparison, like the article, makes little sense.

AK will not hesitate to quote from this article and say that even Kesavan wrote in my favour and I am right..........let us not fool ourselves. AK has not come to govern or do good for Delhi with or without power. His agenda is to pin and prick and enjoy the fun. He is like the cartoon of India today AK surrounded by all the toys but still wants something else. If he was serious he should have started a dialogue with LG and central govt and go wilth a assembly resolution and ask for more powers, just like Andhra was divided. The people struggled for 40 years n got it finally................for that we need leaders not anarchists......so AK is a failed experiment. Hit and run thugs need different medicine.

                            people have realized that news will keep floating but nobody can deny facts on the ground. All MLAs are accessible to people, resolving their issues (earlier people saw their MLAs only during election). Using swaraj, 12 constituencies made their own budget and decided where they want to spend money (normally babus sitting in secretariat plan budget in closed doors and their is bound to be corruption).<br/>
electricity/water prices are low, corruption/bribery is way down, no extortion by police.....<br/>
Good start by AAP. Keep improving and show to India what a good and responsive governance is.

                            It is strange that well read people like Mukul fall for the rhetoric of AAP. It is ridiculous to think that Modi who is a seasoned politician will resort to this kind of tactics to crush AAP. This centre vs state issue came up only because of the appointment on a temporary basis of the senior most bureaucrat and AAP in their exuberance called her tainted and they have gone ahead with upping the ante.  And then the other side used the opportunity to try and play up. AAP did seem to start on good intentions but they seem to think that whatever they know is correct and the rest are corrupt.  Their spokesperson said that the officer was trying to gift away 11000 crores and so on and what it implies is that they had no clue as to what sort of transaction that was.  When the government has  49% shareholding and a comfort letter is given it could have reduced the borrowing cost and helped in turn to reduce the tariff and not as portrayed by AAP.  So to cover up their error they have gone on confrontation mode and the LG seems to have fallen into the trap. To think that Amit SHah and Modi will indulge in this tit for tat with Kejriwal is an insult to their political acumen and their leadership itself

As far as cases like Tomar are concerned, AAP is the only party well placed to take action despite we all know that there are many Tomars in all parties.<br/>
Hope Courts will not all allow selective usage of IPC by Delhi police and Modi government.

                            Kejriwal is doing nothing but blaming others for his own incompetence. He is failure and trying to stay in news by doing drama politics. He killed a farmer in attempt to earn political mileage.

Central govt should not give full powers to AAP govt,though the demand is justified..even BJP or Congress has demanded that earlier.. But AAP has no maturity to use and exercise these powers and giving full statehood to Delhi as long as kejriwal and his tribe is in power will be a total disaster.AAP has no talent,experience and will to run a govt and they will only completely ruin the state.<br/>
 Whatever English I have followed and recalling my limited knowledge of Queen s english.I have tried to reply to Mukul s article here.Forgive me Mukul if I am not in sync with you ...

Without getting into nedless fights he could concentrate on improving the bus service ...totally under him and used by  'aam aadmi'. His claim on cheap electricity is a sham.  The consumers may be directly billed less but are indirectly billed in taxes used to give out subsidy.  Actually kejriwal ensures that Reliance, Tata or others never ever have to suffer any loss.....! AAParty is full of  extemporeanious prevaricators of truth.

On the other hand you will see a person (AK) who has done all the hard work himself to be educated also for his family and able to handle personal and political life. Someone MODIfied his affidavit while submitting to EC as well. going my lead by example He should be one who should step down and be investigated.

                            It is not a question of which party has majority. It is a question of national security. There is a reason why Delhi was not given statehood and that perfectly makes sense. We should not change just because some party has a majority. Why did these AAP supporters and intelligent journalists not raise issue of statehood to Delhi before? It shows that for them party is more important than nation. Their move must be opposed.

                            Hah, Mr Kesavan, you bare your own elitist and snobbish self... You call yourself a writer who is an epitome of honesty? Well I see some serious integrity issues in your expressions. Otherwise you would not be so shamelessly defending a man and his group (mostly of goons) who has given up any claims to accountability and responsible governance. Delhi has had this structure for more than 20 years, and yet repeated Congress governments have done a good job of ruling it, in spite of adversarial governments in the Centre. What AK and his gang are doing is to take advantage of the messy division of power that exists in Delhi, as that sits very well with AK's style of not doing any work of consequence. If you have any shame (which I seriously doubt you do Sir), you would reconsider the stand you have taken. But I guess you hate Modi too much to think straight.

                            There is absolutely no comparison between the two as purported to be portrayed by the author. It is the inability of the AAP to govern and their tendency to find fault with everyone else, is the root cause of the problem. They have made tall promises to the voters of Delhi despite knowing the constitutional position of Delhi government. The hike in power tariff is an example. By the way what happened to the audit of DISCOMS? Is there any proof of corruption as alleged by them. They just make allegations without any substance and if challenged, then apologise or face legal action. Overall, an extremely costly experiment by the Delhites.

                            Arvind intentions do not reflect in his actions and he has not done any thing that proves that he is capable of doing some thing at all.  Through his demonstrations in the street, he has repeatedly demonstrated in intentions and his emotions. Nothing more or less. He has not shown, even after coming to power, that he is capable of developing some plans or does he know that he is capable of doing some thing.  Rather he had chosen not to take up any responsibility at all.  It indicates that he has downloaded his responsibility to his next in command and he would like to continue his conformational politics where is good at.  Unfortunately, it does not work in governance, where one needs to know his limitations, seek the cooperation of bureaucrats &amp; experts, and he has to deliver what he promised to the people of Delhi, given the challenges in the governance of a state.  We have not seen any sign of it at all.
