Headline::::Jayanthi Natarajan, Accomplice Not Martyr



DateTime::::2015-01-31T03:34:00+05:30



(Suhel Seth is Managing Partner of Counselage: India's only strategic brand advisory.)
	So Jayanthi Natarajan has resigned from the Congress. For many in the Congress, this is betrayal by a woman who has herself proclaimed to have Congress blood run in her veins. Whereas I always thought it was the Gandhi blood that was in the veins of every Congress person. What is saddening is that for most she has become a martyr rather than an accomplice.
	Jayanthi Natarajan ran one of the most critical ministries in the Government of India. As the presiding deity of the Ministry of Forests and Environment, she had the unique power of stopping projects ostensibly on the grounds of damage to the environment;  now it is apparent that more than damage to the environment, it was the damage caused to Rahul Gandhi's agenda which made her the obstructionist that she was widely known to be.
	What is even more galling is that as a minister she took her oath of office owing allegiance to the constitution of India and not to some party functionary who was not even in the Cabinet. You can easily call Manmohan Singh a Prime Minister who was silent, but with these revelations it is clear that the Prime Minister was remote -controlled with the mute button often pressed.
	Hence what the Congress did is reprehensible. They interfered with the progress that was easily within India's reach; they completely sidelined the Prime Minister; worst, they created an extra-constitutional authority in the form of Rahul Gandhi who acted on whim rather than through reasoned debate. Equally distressing is the role that they made the then Prime Minister play.
	I am not in the least bit bothered as to what happens to the Congress, Natarajan or for that matter Rahul Gandhi. What I am concerned is by the silence of evil complicity that disallowed the kind of economic progress we deserved,  and the fact that no one in the Cabinet thought it important to flag this to the citizen at large.
	What is surprising is that Natarajan has made this her affair. It is not about Jayanthi Natarajan. It is about India. It is about the functioning of the Government and what's more about not the collective responsibility, but the collective complicity of the Cabinet.
	So will Jayanthi Natarajan quitting the Congress suffice? Should there be no legal action against her or for that matter against Rahul Gandhi? Should we not re-open the cases of those projects that were impacted by some whimsical person who had all the power but zero accountability? The political grandstanding apart, there are four critical questions that need to be addressed for the future:
	1) Do we need greater transparency and objectivity in the manner in which environment clearances are sought and then given?
	2) Would it be wiser to entrust this process of approval to a committee rather than a single individual only to bypass this whole area of individual subjectivity and / or an agenda that the person may be pursuing?
	3) Do we need new laws or should tweak existing laws to ensure there is a course for redressal through our justice system?
	4) What will be the interplay between the Centre and States in areas of environment clearances because it is apparent that while Rahul Gandhi wanted to benefit the tribals in Nyamgiri, he robbed the entire state of Odisha of its fair share of economic progress.
	Neither Natarajan nor for that matter  can Jairam Ramesh answer these questions because they will debate their future in hindsight. But this present Government needs to act swiftly and with great firmness to restore investor confidence that India is a democracy and not a family-owned enterprise.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Extremely well written. All relevant questions that needs to be answered. The way Jayanthi Natarajan, Rahul and Sonia have been running this country and ministry is like running their own home! Whatever they want and like. Unbelievable. Need to hold them accountable!

                            Whatever the revelations, does anyone in this world think that the BJP will be pressing for an investigation? The answer is a big NO! They would not want to hurt their colleagues in the parliament, either in their party or in the opposition. A CBI investigation will be initiated, pulled on for years, and the case will die a "traditional congress" death. The petitioner will be defamed and the guilty will become a minister again. In this case, who knows? Rahul might even become someone important in Indian politics. Such is the shameless legacy we have been handed over by our politicians of the yesteryears. Has any politician been jailed for life for conspiring against the country or its development? None to date! Take for example the Purulia arms drop case. When people like Geelani can make anti-India comments and get away with it because of the incompetence of the govt of the day, what can be said of the politicians? It is rightly said that the last resort of a criminal is politics....specifically Indian Politics! Criminality in politics is not a branch in political science in colleges and schools, but this branch of politics comes easily without even attending classes! And we, the Indian public, search, research, probe, discuss, weigh credentials, convince ourselves and elect the same criminal politicians! A debate on who is to be blamed for this practice is to be called nationally, immediately! Will NDTV spread this message? Since this is anti-congress, I have serious doubts on this comment even being printed. Lets wait and watch. Independence and freedom of speech has still a long way to go in our country, even though it figures in our Consitution! But do the parliamentarians know where the Consitution is or at least the meaning of the national song or national anthem?

                            It is not extra constitutional for a Member of Parliament to write to a minister to consider the complaints/grievances of an NGO or group of people whom they are representing.<br/><br/>
What is an MP or MLA for if they do not represent the views/complaints/grievances of people to the ministers??<br/><br/>
Seems like people of India have forgotten what democracy means. As vice President of the ruling party and an MP, Rahul had every right to send letters to ministers whenever NGOs or people complain.<br/><br/>
And why is it wrong to ask the minister to consider the implications of a project on landless poor, adivasis etc? Govt is there for the welfare of the people, not growth. Growth can be achieved even if few companies like Reliance, Tata an Adani grow at 20% per year(since they constitute more than 5Lakh crore) But India will truly grow if the welfare of the people is taken care by the government

                            Thank you. You have hit the nail on the head. This whole sordid affair is not about the career of a woman who willingly slept with the Devil. It's about how Sonia and family have destroyed the office of the Prime Minister of India and the country's constitution. Any thing short of a Judicial commission to look into the entire sordid affair will not restore anyone's confidence in India's political system. The culprits must be punished. Sonia and family must be thoroughly investigated... it wouldn't be surprising to find that they have compromised the national security....

Vedanta's project got stalled by the competition who never wanted Anil Agarwal to expand his Aluminumm business. Looks like NGO was used to block it. Hope this angle would be investigated by CBI. Definitely millions must have exchanged.

                            Mr.Seth , do not conclude your investigations with baseless allegtions. Why anyone should believe Ms.Natarajan now. Is it because she wants to jump the party and there is no other better way than pleasing her new masters by blaming Rahul or Congress? Grow up man, you are better than just saying what others say. All may want to sing the same song but you must keep your openion to yourself until something is proven.<br/>
Is Rahul siding Tribals and poor is a crime? What is wrong in him suggesting to keep their land from brazenly destroying by these ruthless Industrialists who want to make money for themselves. Are the locals given any job opportunities in these massive plants coming up in grabbing their land and leaving them nothing?

                            The pertinent question is - what was the opposition doing all those years in the Parliament...why were they stalling the Parliament and did not raise questions on the progress of these projects...what stopped them from debating in the lower and upper houses...why Jayanthi Natarajan did not resign and speak up when she was the minister - why was she cozying up on her seat then and there...the party has the responsibility for politically influencing her decisions as they are there to do politics only but it is the minister who needs to act responsibly and in this case she is very irresponsible to have spoken out to the BJP party president instead of the people of the nation !!

                            Facts : Ms Natrajan was ineffective as cabinet minister and obstructive, was asked by a firm PM to quit and go. Just how is this interpreted - weak PM, Ms Natrajan was carrying out some other agenda of Gandhi family. Suddenly being environmentally conscious has become evil, current administration driven by industrialist lobby is doing well to build a perception that India's growth is limited by being environmentally conscious and not because of lack of efficiency of capitalist class who have been used to protection, free natural resources to amass wealth as one of key reason for lack of capital growth. Long being used to free doles and lack of competition, the class of industrialist are driving the agenda like diluting land acquisition, obstructing green peace funding or even travel of activists..hiring people like Suhel to blog and further build drive the perception that environment needs to be sacrificed for GROWTH...

                            In all this, are we not forgetting something else? What about the culpability and accountability of the then PM MMS? He seems to have abrogated all his constitutional authority to someone else! 2G he said Raja did everything without his knowledge, Coal same story. Was he the boss or the door mat? Like Yeshwant Sinha, I have always maintained that MMS is an over-rated Economist and an underrated politician. Should we set up an 'Accountability Commission' to look in to all the misdeeds of the previous government? Or, will it set another bad precedent? If Jayanthi is now screaming that her and her family's reputation was blown to smithereens by people from her own party by planting false stories etc, just imagine what they can to do ruin ordinary citizen's reputation? Isn't it frightening? Gestapo?

                            Revelations in the press on Jayanthi Natarajan's version (in a November 2014 letter to Sonia Gandhi) of what happened before and after her resignation as Minister of State for Environment and Forests seem credible on basic facts.  But they also raise deep concerns about the way UPA conducted our polity.  She says that as Minister she took decisions based on ‘specific inputs'.   If Rahul Gandhi had been giving her directives and she faithfully followed them while discharging her Ministerial powers and duties, obviously the fault did not lie only at one end.  And if the Minister gave effect to inputs and recommendations from Sonia Gandhi who, being Congress President, was also acting as the Chairperson of the National Advisory Council (surely the status of head of NAC could not be above or equal to that of the Prime Minister) then Jayanthi Natarajan was really not in ‘independent' charge of her portfolios.  In all these of her actions the now disowned Minister should take her share of the blame and shame game. <br/><br/>
Jayanthi Natarajan further says she attacked Mr. Narendra Modi, a political opponent at that time, at the behest of the party though, as she says, she was not for it. Could be so.  But the question is also this.  If she had not been dropped but allowed to continue – and implement more of Rahul Gandhi's and Sonia Gandhi's inputs or orders – will she have talked about them in protesting tones to hint that she was not responsible for some of her major acts and decisions as a Minister or for launching personal attacks against an opposition party leader?  Her readiness to do these deeds – especially those concerning with her Minister's job - does more damage to our polity than to the image of her family as she complains in her letter.   Indeed her doing the bidding of party leaders in some important transactions as a Minister – or not being told till she wrote her letter what wrong she committed to deserve such treatment from her party - would not at all sully the image of her grandfather M. Bhaktavatsalam who was known as an upright Congress Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.  If he had been in her place he would not at all have done what she did as a Minister at the behest of scheming and self-centred party orchestrators.  He had acquired such a stand-alone reputation for his conduct and integrity that it will not be tarnished by how the Congress party treated Jayanthi Natarajan decades later.  The other side of it is, the way Jayanthi Natarajan took it all loyally and willingly and obeyed her party bosses and served their orders in her Minister's functions could bring her reputation as a public servant under a cloud.  <br/><br/>
Jayanthi Natarajan's letter to Sonia Gandhi reveals another sad facet of Dr. Manmohan Singh's tenure as Prime Minister, though she did not intend to do that – i.e., he was acting as a proxy Prime Minister who was telling her to resign because he was just told to tell it, and that the Minister also did so instantly without any further questions because she knew that an unseen hand was moving the Prime Minister too.<br/><br/>
The disclosure does a good thing.  It makes us more sharply aware of the power wielded by extra-constitutional authorities in our polity till so recently, with many intelligent Ministers at the central government, many of them acclaimed lawyers, going along with it.  All stake holders must introspect on its potential ill effects.

                            Berating the former environment minister is a side issue. Let us put light on the main reason why the writer is angry with her: she let environmental considerations trump the desires of the majority. This is the real debate! To me, even if a million people want to cut down a forest to build a factory, I say, let them go to hell. There are plenty of wastelands in India. Get your precious 'development' projects done there.

                            Jayanthi Natarajan might be an accomplice or martyr,but one thing is clear..She became victim when she declined to toe line on environments dictated by Bosses of the Party..

                            @RAHMAN: Your comments are the best and very relevant. There is no point in investigating to find what went wrong but to set things right and expedite with. Rider each project has to plant 10,000 trees over the next 5 years. <br/><br/>
Those who may not agree on expediting projects then we might as well wear Langoti and go back to our roots. May be our version of Kunta Kinte.

                            mr. suhel is one sided and selective and also does not doubt that bjp must have blackmailed her to resign at this time of election.he has also chosen to remain silent about her involvements in corrupi practice.further she was no loyal to congress as she once joined tmc.suhel dose not seam to be a fair journalist.

                            WHY DID SHE NOT EXPOSE THE SITUATION TO THE NATION AND RESIGN AT THAT TIME?  DID SHE NOT FEEL THAT SHE WAS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE NATION NOT TO ANY SINGLE PARTY OR INDIVIDUAL...NOW THAT HER PARTY IS NOT IN POWER AND SHE TRIES TO DAMAGE HER OWN PARTY WHERE SHE ENJOYED THE BENEFITS FOR DECADES....

                            MR SUHEL SETH, IT SEEMS FROM YR ESSAY AS TO HOW THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCES SHOULD TAKE PLACE - IS SUGGESTION TO GOVT. !! 1ST, MRS JAYANTHI NATARAJAN IS RESPONSIBLE AS SHE WAS MINISTER. SHE SHOULD HV TAKEN APPROPRIATE DECISION AT THAT TIME. NOW TALKING ANYTHING BY HER IS OUT OF TIME. 2ND, DO U HV ANY CONCRETE PROOF ABOUT MR RAHUL GANDHI THAT HE HAS GIVEN SUCH &amp; SUCH ORDERS. U R JUST PRESUMING. ALL GOVTS. WORK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PARTY HIGH COMMAND BECAUSE ANY &amp; ALL MINISTERS ARE BASICALLY PARTY MEMBERS AND IT IS EXISTING IN ALL PARTIES. U SUGGESTED REMEDY IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS &amp; U WROTE AS AN AUTHORITY WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY BASELESS. U HV TO HV AN INDUSTRIALISTS TO KNOW THE REMEDY BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT R THE DIFFICULTIES &amp; HOW THE CLEARANCE GRANTED. WHAT STEPS/DIFFICULTIES THEY GO THROUGH. LASTLY, PRESENT GOVT. NEED NOT GO TO FIND OUT WHAT WENT WRONG ETC. ETC., BUT THEY SHOULD TRY TO CLEAR PROJECTS ASAP - WITHOUT COMPROMISING RULES.

                            I am a little confused by this issue. So, an MP writing letters to the Govt. (also of same party) expressing opinion about tribal rights (which has been later also the position of the courts) is interference, but, the corporate houses who are NOT parliamentarians are making the Modi govt. dilute all environmental concerns and pass all projects without even a 2nd look is NOT interference. And taking a pro tribal position is Crony Capitalism, whereas passing all projects to increase corporate profits is not crony capitalism. LOL. Goebbels Jaitley Jai Ho!!

                            It is with great dismay I am writing this. People are not fools. Recent activities by BJP does not give them a decent look. Ajit Pawar corruption, Vadra land deal, Jaya scam and Hon'ble Arun Jaitley meeting her recently, conversions issue, Shardha scam, black money all has been dragged. no concrete steps taken and looks like BJP is using these to gain advantage or even blackmail parties and they keep these issues just simmering. People are watching. They are already getting a feeling that what ever the party, politicians are corrupt. Mr Modi was voted to power on expectations. These activities are disproving the expectation. Please, BJP and Mr Modi, act fast, and do not lose confidence of the people of India. Do something to show you REALLY mean it.

                            Well said Mr.Seth.The new Govt must thoroughly inquire the entire issue including urgent clearances given by Moily.The country knows the entire UPA rule was centered around Gandhi family and run on their whims and fancies.

                            Economic progress should not be at the cost of damage to the environment? We need to strike a balance between the two... <br/>
Are we not capable of progressing economically without doing much damage to he environment? Let our industrialists &amp; politicians think  about the environment before damaging it badly in the name of PROGRESS. <br/>
Progress should never be at the cost of our future generations.
