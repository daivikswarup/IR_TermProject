Headline::::Smriti Irani's College Degree is Not the Problem



DateTime::::2015-06-29T04:09:00+05:30




                                One really can't blame Smriti Irani, our Education Minister, for the mess in education - since she is really not much educated herself. Oh, she did pass her school-leaving exams, but can't quite remember what degree course she applied for or at which University, although she does remember spending five days at Yale - and has a certificate to prove it. But does that really matter? After all, Kamaraj did not need a University degree to prove himself an outstanding Chief Minister, and both Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi went to University abroad but returned without a degree. Â 
No, an education is no more required to be an Education Minister than a flying qualification is indispensable to being a Civil Aviation Minister. And God help us if a General were to become Defence Minister - for that would make us Pakistan.
Moreover, what Smriti lacks in graduation papers, she makes up for in fluency in both English and Hindi (and, I am told, in Marathi and Gujarati). She is articulate and self-confident in Parliament, and has a natural flair for the cut and thrust of public debate, which she deploys with great effect at the hustings. She made a considerable mark in her earlier career as a star of the small screen. Little wonder that she caught Modi's attention at such a young age, or that he should have opted for her to take the Human Resource Development (HRD) portfolio.
What surprises me is that a Minister of her personality and oratorical skills should be so mishandling the work entrusted to her. I suspect that has less to do with her own qualities of intellect and upbringing than with the forces that are attempting to control policy-making in her Ministry. The two forces I have been able to identify are the Sangh Parivar and the Prime Minister - the Parivar providing the Hindutva thrust and Modi the authoritarian mindset.
The worst display of Hindutva has been at the Indian Council of Historical Research where a wholly unqualified mythologist has been appointed Chairman, a post that should be earmarked for an outstanding academic with world-wide peer recognition, as has been the case so far. It is possible to be a right-wing intellectual and yet gain international recognition. Indeed, a large number of renowned Western mind-workers have been precisely that. For example, no one would dispute the intellectual stature of both Isaiah Berlin and Isaac Deuscher, representing between them the right-to-left spectrum of historiography and political philosophy; or of, say, the right-leaning Karl Popper and the left-leaning E.H. Carr. All four of them merit, and continue after their passing away to merit, prime niches for themselves in academia's Halls of Fame. Why not in India?
Of course, it cannot be gainsaid that most contemporary Indian historians who have earned the admiration of their peers world-wide have been to the left of centre, with little sympathy for the fantasies of Hindu or any other mythology. That can neither exclude the major role that right - and religiously-inclined Indian historians of high distinction have played in the past in the Rediscovery of Indian History from Imperial myth-making, nor the possibility of finding similarly inclined historians at present. It is not their leaning but their academic standing that is the moot point. After all, if two eminent economists like Amartya Sen and Jagdish Bhagwati can have such radically differing ideologies, or two great historian-novelists, such as VS Naipaul and Amitav Ghosh can belong to such diametrically opposed schools of thought, it should not be beyond the bounds of bureaucratic (or Ministerial) possibility to find a respectable right-wing Hindutva-inclined historian to match, say, Irfan Habib.
True, I am not immediately able to think of a single eminent Indian historian who bends towards the religious right. But then I am not the HRD Minister and do not possess the powerful search engines at the Minister's disposal. To take the easy way out of easing out a whole panoply of top historians merely because they are not devotees of Savarkar or Golwalkar, and bringing in someone of a different ilk precisely because he does not believe the aeroplane was invented by the Wright brothers, is to do the worst that any Minister who holds Smriti Irani's position could possibly do.
Similar outrages are in the process of being performed on school text books under the malevolent patronage of so-called historians like Dina Nath Batra, who is better suited to organize a crusade against Mohammad bin Qassim than teach genuine history to innocent young minds. The manipulation of syllabi, and the excising or inclusion of text books for ideological not academic reasons, apart from partisan packing of the Central Advisory Board for Education, is but the beginning of a process of twisting the Idea of India to fit a perverse ideological mindset. She might as well move the NCERT (National Centre for Educational Research and Training) from Delhi to Nagpur!
If it is Hindutva that is setting the work-agenda of the HRD Ministry, it is Moditva that is setting its authoritarian style of work. The attempt to shut the mouths of a student think-tank at IIT, Guindy is one example of the Emergency-style of functioning that Modi seems to have learned from Sanjay Gandhi circa 1975-77.
So is the manipulation of appointments and transfers of heads of Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). The current rumpus over the draft Bill to regulate the Indian Institutes of Management to make them subserve the diktats of the Government is but the latest example of Modtiva in action. Centralization of authority, authoritarianism in decision-making, undermining of academic freedom in the administration of institutions of excellence is being prioritized.
Universities are also under threat in the proposed Universities Bill. As Romila Thapar has remarked, "With standardization and centralization, Universities will become teaching shops and coaching schools". Is this the way to bring acche din to our burgeoning student population? For, to quote Prof. Thapar again, "Poor quality education and large numbers of young people who are unqualified for the jobs they seek doesn't make for a healthy society". That is the nub of the problem. If Smriti Irani does not recognize it, our so-called "demographic dividend" could turn into a "demographic disaster."
If, of course, the courts decide that her affidavits regarding her educational qualifications (or, at any rate, her attempts to secure them) disqualify her from continuing as Minister, they might put her out of her misery before she can inflict more on the country.

                            Smriti Irani has been amazingly articulate but that doesn't defend her decisions. Certain decisions have been tad bad.<br/>
Education of course cannot be a barometer, if that would have been the case you would have gone places. All said and done "You are a moron and a moron you will be"

                            MSA is spot on. All modi could find in 130 crore Indians was a school pass to head our HRD effort at educating 50 crore Indians. Only in India can an uneducated minister be in charge of education. Smriti barely managed to understand education, and is messing up , every well known Institutions, such as IITs and IIMs. All Fekutards are cursing MSA out of scorn and hatred. Not one of them would gladly ask their kids to just aim for a school pass qualification. Shame on Modi Bhakts.

                            Irani is the only cabinet minister to walk into the PMO without being frisked. They do not say whether a similar facility existed for the Gandhis during Congress rule. This breakneck accent isn't the stuff of good news, at least for BJP old timers. It's rumoured to have even caused discomfort to party president and Modi aide, Amit Shah.

                            Well Mr.Mani Shankar Aiyar, you invested a lot of time to write this article and is highly appreciated. As you said , everyone has their own school of thought and i do respect everyone`s perception, no matter if I like it or not. Finally I would like to request you to have a look at the interviews given by Ms.Smriti Irani with Mr.Arunab Goswami and Mr.Rajdeep Sardesai and I hope you will be exposed to multiple views on the issues addressed above. Honestly, I find Ms. Smriti Irani as the only capable and eminent leader &amp; individual to lead the this 2nd largest population to a much greater heights. She has faced worst of the challenges posed to her and if I request you to look at the scenario from a third person`s view, you might understand my point to certain degree. While the women across the world are raising voices to empower them, there is one women who does not require others to empower her and stands for herself. <br/>
I hold a neutral view towards politics or any party but I carry a strong view towards efficient leaders, starting from Sachin Pilot to our Hon.PM a and towards our HRD minister. India has developed exponentially and more people are literate, civilized and educated. We definitely understand the framework on which education policies are formed and she has empowered us with online portals to raise our voice in case we have a concern about them.None of us do not want something bad for us. We always needed a leader who took feedback from the people they govern too before forming any new policies and procedure and she excels in it. India is a democratic country and it`s a government of the people of union republic of India, by the people of Union Republic of India and of the people of Union republic of India.<br/>
Last but not the least the one who succeeds more is condemned more. I can too publish posts similar to the one you posted but chose not to do so because people simply know the truth.

                            Mani the moron's educational qualifications are well known but to remind the hapless NDTV readers, he started at Doon School where mere chaiwallas like me would have been kicked by the prim and proper Mani types before being allowed to do our normal work.  Mani then went on to St Stephen's, another elitist institution that, being Christian in outlook looks down at other institutions particularly with the word 'Hindu' in any nomenclature.  Here Mani the moron's claim to fame was that he was the top student.  Mani the moron then went on to Cambridge where he got a poor 'second'.  Whilst at Cambridge, regarded generally as an institution producing 'Soviet Spies' such as Philby, Burgess, Maclean and Blunt, Mani the moron was a passionate Marxist.  The aforementioned spies were all rabid homosexuals and so it is likely that the homosexual traditions remained when young Mani the moron was a student there.  One can make what one wants of Mani's hero worship of Rajiv Gandhi and his useless offspring Rahul but the atmosphere at Cambridge has probably informed on Mani the moron's proclivities towards these two dreadful characters.  Rumour has it that whilst at Cambridge, Mani the moron was raising funds for the Chinese who at that time were in a life and death struggle with India where China was very much inclined towards the 'life' part whilst India was as near 'death' as possible.  Mysteriously, his slate was wiped clean when Mani the moron entered Babudom but then again, a fellow Cambridgewalla was in charge, a certain Jawaharlal Nehru!  Mani the moron's career in the babu world was singularly unremarkable but he did reach the dizzy heights of becoming joint secretary, Travels and Tours for his hero Rajiv.  It was at this juncture that Mani the moron developed his world famous sycophancy skills.  Such has been his success in this arena that he now speaks on every matter under the sun on behalf the dreadful Nehru-Gandhi parivar.  All that Doon School, St Stephen's and Cambridge education and Mani the moron ends up being world famous only as the parivar's undisputed sycophancy champion.  Those of us who have never been anywhere near a University let alone studied in one would make our choices as to what we prefer by the logical process of comparison; as far as I am concerned, give me mythology, give me right wing Hinduism, give me stories about successful elephant head to human body transplants via plastic surgery, in fact give me all that Mani the moron despises but please keep Mani the moron away from me; the one thing I do not want to be is a sycophant!!!

                            Mani is building an Alibi so that his masters and madam need not be discussed in public. So he has safely proclaimed that its ok not to have any degree....<br/><br/>
Also, the seculars are desparately trying to further their school of thinking , be it in school, history, art or literature.... They are trying ot protect each other, defend each other so that collecctively, they remain RELEVANT..<br/><br/>
In the history of Indian Civilization, every school of thought had its period and relevance. For example rituals had its primacy when philosophy took over... Same way, with the caste atrocities becoming peak, anti-brahmanism was immediate reaction to the opression. However, the relevance of Periyar and caste based and anti-Hindu views have lots its place in the time. Society continues to evolve in spite of the seculars and anti-hindu morons ( both within and the missionary types) making noises.... <br/><br/>
India will rise once again in the middle of these morons and would prove to be a worthwhile civilization. And mind you, the likes of seculars would continue to remain on the extreme fringe as it represents one philosophy of thought !!!!

                            Jamaicans often say 'if you throw a stone in pig-sty one that screens the loudest has been hit'.--- <br/>
So by rightly pointing out how under RSS controlled Prime Minister Modi's complete bimbo cabinet minister Smriti Irani everything is getting saffronised and screwed, Shri Mani Shankar Aiyar has managed to hit not only one but virtually all the Hindu Fundamentalist Fascist pigs in one go.--- <br/>
because Mani Shankar Aiyar is exceptionally well informed and good at analysing and exposing the real danger of obnoxious  organisations like BJP, the puppet of evils like RSS, it is hardly surprising that the brainless wonders who hero worship Indian version of Hitler, Narindra Modi, get agitated  like rattle snakes every time Mr. Aiyar tells few hard hitting truths about the dangers of the policies of this useless  government.--<br/>
 If decent Indians keep on ignoring the warnings of people like Mr. Aiyar, the extreme rightwing Hindu Fundamentalist Fascistic Mob will turn India into mirror image of failed rouge country Islamo Fascist Pakistan or world's most primitive place Saudi Arabia. <br/>

                            Very true, Mani Aiyerji. See how Sonia Gandhi who is also not well educated, served people in a bar, and see how she even without enough qualifications, manipulated a highly educated PM of a country of 125 crores for her personal gains and made tons of money in the process. Or see how Raul Gandhi who is also not so very qualified is making a fool of the entire congress party which is bowing in obedience and urging him to lead the country of 125 crores.

                            Despite the eloquence with which you have sought out to prove wrong the appointment of a mythologist as a chairman of the Indian Council of Historical Research, I would like to point out that the people who crave the peer recognition of the west have only tried to tow their line (whether you call it left, right or center) - the eminent scientists have looked so westwards that the effect of simple exercises of yoga are relegated to a scorned AYUSH, while physiotherapy is acclaimed as a science! We need to move out of the mindset that if the westerners approve, then the person is great. Please understand that the westerners will approve of those items only if they benefit from it. How else can you defend the success of Stephen Covey's 7 habits, while the Gita stated long-ago 'dharma (the first word) mama (the last word)' is the beginning. You rubbish Gita as mythology but sell Covey!? A cultural change is required to protect our culture. You may say it is extreme right thinking, but I would say it extreme left thinking as I do not want my national priorities to be dictated by West that has successfully ruled over us for long.

                            I cannot agree less. But at the same time our other great highly educated leaders have not also brought any repute. IITs and IIMs have lost their charm .. their standard is going down , they stand nowhere in world ranking.<br/><br/>
so what is the point ?

                            Can you compare this with Sonia Gandhi, who faked the degree, and everything, then heading the party which ruled 10 straight years making one of the best talent Mr Man Mohan a Joke, cannot articulate or show confident in speech neither in parliament nor in public, not able to bring the only son to some level of decency of leadership ? Even Smriti Irani faked or ignored to put correct degree, she has the charisma to face public and answer in parliament, not hiding in Bangkok, God knows what people do there :). You being such a towering and eminent leader, really doesn't suite to lick mother son parody, please come out of that and do some ideal stuff. I appreciate what Mr Chidamberam and Mr Pranab Mukharjee have done.

                            The problem is that left wing historians have given no space to alternate historians in India, even when they are not able to explain inconsistencies of their theories. They also erect barriers against scientists and Sanskrit scholars, even when ancient India had confluence of literature, poetry, histrory, science and philosophy in the minds of sages. Same sage uses mathematics to design Vedic Altars for sacrificed and prescribed rituals in Sulaba Sutra.

                            AAPtards regularly try to compare Smriti and Tomar and but differences are huge.<br/>
First Smriti put wrong qualification but she didn't take out a fake degree to match her wrong qualification.Secondly she corrected her mistake in 2011 and 2014 submission.Mind before 2012 it was not criminal offence to fill wrong submission.<br/>
Regarding abilities as speaker and worker no Tomar can match her ever.

Congress will be left with Maa-beta-Beti-Damad and coteries like you. APP and other regional parties will be opposition. Congress will continue writing meaningless blogs.

                            MSA ..i think if there's something good to get from the religion in terms of education, it should be taken. After all there's a proven track record of scientific discoveries in the ancient times, and at that time people were pretty religious and education was based on the religion. Stop highlighting Religion as the villain when the actual devil is people's narrow mindset and misinterpretation of Religion. Charaka, Shushrut etc are just some examples of advances in medicine and suregeries and i think you'll be shocked to know that both of them were Hindu Rishis. Unani Medicine..which is non-the-less effective is a derivative of Muslim Faith.

Come on - in order to fix the education system of our country - one has to have a deep understanding of the system and an understanding and knowledge of the system would REQUIRE HAVING GONE THROUGH THE SYSTEM. Therefore minimum requirement for the HRD Union Minister of India must be a PHD. One doctorate mandatory preferable 2. Mr Aiyer, without ever having experienced an 'education' at our institutes of learning - how does one know how to fix all that is wrong. All we have to do is imitate Singapore. Right now the country's education - which is the single most important need for our young nation, is in the hands of somebody who has no clue! Nobody is arguing that ms Irani is smart - mr Modi could have given her any other portfolio but NOT education. So whichever party is in power at the center - do not play around with the HRD ministry!
