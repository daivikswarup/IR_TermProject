Headline::::Congress Reeling from Anti-Leadership of Gandhis



DateTime::::2015-01-22T19:18:00+05:30



(Siddharth Varadarajan is a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Public Affairs and Critical Theory, Shiv Nadar University)Eight months on from its stunning defeat at the hands of Narendra Modi, the Congress party still does not know how to find its footing on the frightening new political terrain where it is placed.With just 44 MPs in the Lok Sabha and only a handful of state governments under its control, the party has slipped into a deep existential crisis in which neither its 125-year-old foundations - such as they are - nor the stifling embrace of its dynastic leaders is able to hold the party faithful together. The defection of Krishna Tirath to the Bharatiya Janata Party is perhaps the first time someone who was a cabinet minister in an outgoing government has crossed over to the winning side so soon after an election. In Haryana, senior Congress leader Birender Singh switched sides on the eve of the recent assembly election and was promptly rewarded with a berth in the Union cabinet. Between the electorate's anger towards the Congress and Amit Shah's skill in engineering key defections, the BJP's project of a 'Congress-free India' is making remarkable progress. And what remains of the party is slowly being destroyed by the anti-leadership of the Gandhis and by the ideological and organizational disarray visible at all levels and branches of the party (like Punjab, Assam and Tamil Nadu) and also now in its upper echelons.A telling example of the ideological confusion and even panic prevailing at the top is the recent comment by senior party leader Janardan Dwivedi describing Modi's rise to the prime ministership as "the victory of Indianness". "Modi and the BJP have been successful in convincing people that from a social point of view, they are closer to Indian citizens", he told rediff.com's seasoned bureau chief, Sheela Bhatt on Wednesday. "In essence, without spelling it out further, in a way this is a victory of Indianness," he said. Dwivedi, as any reporter who has covered the party knows, is not any old Congressman. He is not a maverick like Mani Shankar Aiyar or a junior leader like Shashi Tharoor, but the man Sonia Gandhi relies on the most for public political communication. So how do we interpret the meaning of what he has just said? Had the remarks been made right after the election result, one could put it down to shell-shock. But coming nearly a year after that catastrophic verdict, his views suggest the condition pyschologists call post-traumatic stress disorder has breached the walls of the party's "high command". Since he has not sought refuge in the claim of being misquoted, it is reasonable to conclude that Dwivedi is either preparing the ground for his defection or has lost the capacity to reason. I say this because his claim is not even one the BJP has ever made publicly. It fought the 1999 and 2004 elections on the platform of Sonia Gandhi's Italian origins - some BJP leaders even targeted Rahul Gandhi for not having an Indian mother -- but chose to attack the mother-son duo in 2014 for being dynasts and not 'foreigners'. The BJP, and most independent analysts, see Modi's victory as an expression of the electorate's aspirations for economic betterment, and they are right. Indians voted for the man they believed was better placed to deliver employment and development. They did not vote for him because he was more "Indian" than Rahul Gandhi. So why did Modi win? Apart from leveraging his experience in administration and the support of corporate India, he proved to be better skilled in the art of politics and communication than anyone in the Congress - which compounded the accumulated sins of misgovernance with political blunders that the BJP made ample use of. No rocket science or deep cultural theory is needed to decode the meaning of the result. All one needs to do is plot the contours of India's recent political history. Every time a ruling party has been completely out of sync with the aspirations of the electorate, it has ended up being trounced at the hustings. The popular yearning for democracy unseated Indira Gandhi in 1977, the aspiration for economic justice and social harmony saw Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani lose in 2004, while the desire for growth, jobs and development led to the defeat of the UPA in 2014.These three electoral defeats were not the product of  parties that were "un-Indian" in a cultural sense but of party organizations so beholden to their familial or corporate stakeholders that they lost their political instincts and started believing their own propaganda.Truth to tell, the reason Dwivedi cannot look at the defeat of the Congress in this way and finds refuge in pseudo-pyschological babble is because the party has long stopped functioning as a political organism. Sonia Gandhi has cracked the whip and got the party to officially denounce Dwivedi's formulations. But what will she do about the underlying pathology? There is no scope in family-run enterprises for critical analysis and thinking. The reason the Congress is unable to grasp and respond to the demands of the country is not because its president was born in Orbassano, Italy, but because she is not an effective leader, her designated successor, the Indian-born Rahul, is arguably worse, and there is no scope for women and men with sharp political instincts to rise to the top. It is a pity Dwivedi could not bring himself to say this. Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the

                            A very balanced assay by the Author.I am in full agreement.Mr.Dwivedi and Sashi Tharoor in my opinion are contemplating a switch to BJP and it should be welcomed.The Congress is terminally ill,the only way out is for Mrs Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to formally resign and take MS Aiyar,Diggi and other sycophants with them.The Congress can hope to rebuilt in the coming 10 yrs.Mr.Modi is going to be India's PM at least until 2024.

                            The Congress debacle is due a feeling that its their birth right to rule. Days have changed .The common man wants more. He wants governance , a safe place to live in, and earn a decent salary. This has eroded over time. Unfortunately it was a case of choosing between the better of the two evils. However, Modi has shown the people a ray of hope and people have trusted him. He should therefore be given a chance. <br/>
Yes for true democracy we should have a vibrant opposition. But not the type to stall important sessions but to contribute to the betterment of the country and its people. <br/>
As some have rightly pointed out there is no dearth of good, honest,learned and efficient youngsters in the Congress. Sachin, Scindia, Jr Deora etc. The problem is who is to bell the cat ? How dare anybody opposes the family. Honestly the family looks jaded and disinterested. Why is the Congress trying to flog a dead horse. They should allow the younger blood to nurture and revive the Congress. Sycophancy in the Congress should end and merit should be the only criteria. Its best the family takes the lead and gracefully steps down.

                            I think it is Siddharth Varadarajan who doesn't get it. Dwivedi knew all along that the Congress was a continuation of the British mindset. Nehru openly called himself "the last Englishman to rule India". Congress always pretended to value Indian-ness, but it was done to satisfy their own ego - at their core, they didn't respect Indian-ness or even thought it capable of world class. I can't really blame Nehru for propagating that mindset - he was born in British India. What the West thought of him mattered a lot. <br/><br/>
Modi comes from the RSS class. He has no pretensions about looking Westernized or seeking their social approval. He is fully aware of what he said about Ganpati. No Nehru or Congress leader would ever say that. I too see Modi's victory as India finally claiming governance of itself, tossing the British mindset aside. The identity of European and North American nations are that they are Christian nations. Not in an intolerant sense, but it is a practical statement of truth. India under Congress could not acknowledge itself as a Hindu nation. The new Indians can, in the same way as the West.

                            India should have only one party rule. It has to be BJP because it is highly nationalistic,respects women leadership (Rajasthan CM,Gujarat CM,now would be Delhi CM),most of the leadership is non corrupt as they do not even have families,they all come from the janta. Represented well by all classes of society and very focused for India.

                            Very rightly said. They reportedly prevented "The Red Sari" from being published in India only because the book revealed details of her humble birth and living in that village in Italy. This would not accord with the deservedly  "Royal" status accorded to her here. But while she and her party were totally rejected by the voters, Modi, who openly claimed to have once been a Tea seller, was taken to their bosom by Indians who, through their  overwhelming choice, made him their PM, notwithstanding, or perhaps very much because of, Mani Shankar Iyer's ridicule of Modi as a "Chaiwalla". 'Poetic justice' cannot be defined any better.

                            There is lot of truth in what Mr. Diwedi said, Indians are fed up with english speaking elites who think they are the rulers and look up to west. Modi's win is win of Indianess, people see Modi as one of the them, he speaks hindi, he uses English as second language  and doesn't think that he is an elite born to rule.

                            Why just Gandhis? Almost all the leaders are second or third generation politicians in Congress. There is nothing inherently wrong in it - except for Indian social structure.<br/>
Once you become well-to-do, your next generation starts becoming "baba-log", away form reality. Politics is a business of reality (and perception). <br/>
That is where Rajiv was luckier than Rahul is. He still could manage some decent first generation politicians around him.<br/>
The rest is history.

                            [1/22, 11:57 AM] Binoy Thomas: Railway fares hiked. Petrol prices hiked. Black money gone. No politician involved in Swiss bank accounts. Old congress policies continued. So, what next?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
Abki baar Modi sarkar<br/>
[1/22, 3:49 PM] Binoy Thomas: I don't agree congress has done nothing and we have not progressed. Few years back, especially after independence we did not have anything to eat. People were literally starving. If you see old photos you can notice hollow faced emaciated peasants all over India. Even telephones and cars were out of bounds for the middle class. Water borne diseases were very common. No gas connection and fridge. People struggled to survive. No jobs. If not for Rajiv Gandhi we would not have progressed. I remember then communist party blaming Rajiv Gandhi , they felt all jobs will be eaten up by computers and people will face unemployment if computerization is done. No compress and IT are generating millions of jobs. The average height and health of our population has increased. Kerosene stoves are out. Many housewives used to die due to in-house smoke chullas. Mobile, mobikes, cars are now common. Internet has penetrated rural India. We have the best doctors in the world. The best engineers, the best army. We can conquer UK if they did not have pacts and treaties with other countries. We have a strong consumer market, which every international brand is greedy to enter. So we definitely have developed after Rajiv Gandhi<br/>
[1/22, 5:19 PM] Binoy Thomas: :  India's arable land area of 159.7 million hectares (394.6 million acres) is the second largest in the world, after the United States. Its gross irrigated crop area of 82.6 million hectares (215.6 million acres) is the largest in the world. India is among the top three global producers of many crops, including wheat, rice, pulses, cotton, peanuts, fruits and vegetables. Worldwide, as of 2011, India had the largest herds of buffalo and cattle, is the largest producer of milk and has one of the largest and fastest growing poultry industries<br/><br/>

                            Nice article and I agree with most of what the author said. I disagree though, with the statement that the BJP's "Congress Mukt Bharat" project is going well. To the common man, that meant elimination of everything the Congress represented - corruption, nepotism, dynasty, indifference, elitism and so on. If Amit Shah is trying to achieve this objective by simply engineering defections, all he is doing is importing Congressmen accused of the above sins into his own party. The underlying problem is still there. I sure hope that's not the plan. If it is then we won't have a Congress Mukt Bharat. It will remain a catchy slogan. One that may not win Modi his next election.

                            it is really amazing to see all these comments. 80 percent from rss/bjp stooooges and chamchas. just explain what is the real face of bjp. a party that has thrived on lies deception and double speak. take each of its leaders and see their life full of lies and double speak. in most social media forum the congress as a political party is commented upon, bashed and critized. the most frequent question is what the congress did for 60 years. my answer: where u a country like usa 60 years ago.it takes time to build a nation. nehru, indira, rao , rajiv , mammohan great leaders in their own right. they have done great things for the country. you RSS/BJP chamchas using social media, this is possible due to indira and rajiv gandhi. the strides in space technology, communicataions, defence, maruti, sattelites, asian games, 1971 war victory, NAM etc. Compare with bjp/rss achievements parliament attack, kargil, coffin scam, yeddi, purti, judev, petrol bulk scam, ic 814 hijack and a foreign minister accompaniying terrorists and so called iron man home minister not knowing it(lying). who did in bjp/rss participate in the freedom struggle. Remember ur great leader vajepayee gave in writing that he would participate in freedom  struggle. your feku and false promises. your 5 inch chest fooled as 56 inch. this congress is thousand times better than u fekus bjp . they may be down but not out. a 100 year old party cannot be dumped just like that. sonia gandhi hindi is much better than half of chamchas in bjp/rss.so wake up stupids.
