Headline::::India Has Taken A Rash Decision On Juveniles



DateTime::::2015-12-23T09:48:00+05:30




                                The Juvenile Justice Amendment Bill lowering the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16 years was passed in the Rajya Sabha after opposition parties like the Congress and the TMC resiled from their earlier stand of referring the amendment to a Select Committee for further deliberation.
 
The Left parties walked out of the Rajya Sabha in protest against the refusal of the Government to send the JJ Act Amendment Bill to a Select Committee as decided earlier. The Left MPs were specifically opposed to the proposal to lower the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16.
 
Further deliberation was all the more necessary since the Parliamentary Standing Committee of the HRD Ministry had unanimously rejected the recommendation for lowering the age of the juvenile from 18 to 16 years as proposed by the BJP government. It had held that the government was basing its argument on misleading data and that it violated certain provisions of the constitution. Apart from the CPI(M), there were other speakers from the Samajwadi Party, the NCP, and the DMK who also raised the demand, but at the end, the ayes carried the Bill through.
 
One of the reasons for the shift to a decision to pass the Bill without reference to a Select Committee was the successful role of the BJP, helped by sections of the media, in building up a hysterical campaign that it was because the Rajya Sabha was not passing the Bill that the juvenile in the Nirbhaya case was going to walk free. In fact, it was well known that the Act in any case had no retrospective effect, and that this would not have  impacted in any way the Nirbhaya case, but this did not prevent a misleading and misinformative campaign. The entire focus in the media was not the argument for or against the amendment, but on the basis of the the specific Nirbhaya case and the images of the expressed grief of Jyoti's mother, Asha Devi.
 
After the High Court and Supreme Court rejected the petitions to prevent the juvenile from walking free, Asha Devi said that she felt let down and that all the assurances given to her proved to be lies. Who had given a grieving mother such false assurances? How did she come to believe that a change in law would affect her case? Is this not exploitation of grief and sorrow for political ends? Yet, day in and out, it was this grief which was used to mount an irrational campaign.
 
Regretfully, the Delhi Commission of Women (DCW) also became party to these false assurances, which is, perhaps, why Jyoti's mother accused the Commission of indulging in "drama." The Chairperson filed a petition on the utterly bizarre report pushed by interested parties that the juvenile had been " radicalized" by sharing a cell with a Kashmiri militant and posed a threat to society. Can an official institution such as the DCW make such grave accusations without any evidence on the basis of unverified press reports? Does she know that it was Subramanian Swamy, whose petition against the juvenile had been rejected by the Supreme Court, who first made this accusation which was never accepted in a single report of the Juvenile Justice Board? Further, just because an adolescent is a Kashmiri, does that automatically make him a recruiter for terrorist activity? Even worse, the DCW Chairperson made an entirely unverified statement that the juvenile showed "no remorse." Who told her that? Did she check with the Chair of the Juvenile Justice Board? It is extremely unfair that taking advantage of the confidentiality of all reports of the Board concerning juveniles, wild charges are made against an individual.
 
There can be no sympathy with any of those guilty, including the then juvenile, of the horrendous crime against Jyoti. But stick to the facts.The charge quoted by official institutions like the DCW that he was the most brutal of the criminals repeated ad nauseam in these three years is based on what? The investigation officer in the case has said it is not true that it was he who had committed the brutality with the iron rod. The charge sheet does not mention it either, nor does the report of the Juvenile Justice Board. Yet, it is this campaign which has dominated public debate on the issue.
 
In 2014 a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court specifically quoted the scientific evidence of the processes of brain development of adolescents as one of the reasons to reject eight petitions which sought to challenge the age of 18 in the JJ Act. In March 2014, a bench of the Supreme Court headed by the then Chief Justice P Sathasivan, along with Justices Ranjan Gogoi and Shivakirti Singh, in their judgement said "studies of adolescent anatomy clearly indicate that regions of the brain that regulate such things as foresight, impulse control, resistance to peer pressure are in a developing stage upto the age of eighteen.These are normative phenomenon that a teenager cannot control and not a pathological illness or defect..." This is not to justify juvenile crime but to find  ways in which to address it.
 
However, when in the Rajya Sabha debate, a member raised the issue of  development of the brain, the Minister made a totally confused reply. Maneka Gandhi said this is "nature versus nurture." How can a Minister refer to a debate which is about genetic traits in a person's nature as opposed to the environment which develops his/her nature,  which is entirely different from what was being discussed, namely the physical anatomy of the brain? This just shows the utter lack of thought, fudging of data and the distortion of concepts in the discussion from the official side.
 
The issue of increase in juvenile crime, which was one of the main reasons cited for lowering the age to 16, is also entirely decontextualised. Yes, juvenile crime has increased, but not as a percentage of all crime.When our society is getting more and more violent, are our children not going to be influenced? For the last five years, juvenile crime as a proportion of total crime is 1.5 per cent. That's it. These are official stats from the National Crime Research Bureau. But the even more significant fact - that the percentage of repeat offences by those who have been through the reform process has in the last five years actually decreased from around 12 per cent to 5 per cent - was also not cited.
 
And who are these children? They are overwhelmingly the children of the poor. Of the 48,230 juveniles in custody in 2014, only 439 belonged to families who had an income over four lakh rupees a year. 37,000 belonged to families with an income of less that 50, 000 rupees a year or 6,000 rupees a month. Does it mean that because they are poor, their crimes should be ignored or they should be treated differently? Not at all; but to ignore the socio-economic characteristics of juvenile crime and to think that treating 16-year-old as adults is going to prevent further crime is a foolish proposition. Sending 16-year-olds to jails like Tihar to serve a seven-year sentence is more likely to create hardened criminals.
 
The present maximum term of three years in the JJ Act could have been enhanced through an amendment that after the three years, there could be a system of a halfway home in which the released juvenile/adult could stay, being monitored and supervised to assist in his/her mainstreaming with the aim of reform not retribution.
 
There are societies where children are tried under adult laws and institutions. Has it helped stop juvenile crime?
 
A good example is the United States of America. In 2000, by raising the juvenile age to 18, India complied with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The United States of America was one of the countries which refused to comply with the Convention. In the US, the age of the juvenile differs and in some states is as low as 12-14 years. Hundreds of thousands of children are tried, sentenced and incarcerated under adult law. According to one assessment, 1.6 million arrests of juveniles were made during 2009-2010. According to another assessment, on any given day, there are 10,000 children in adult jails across America. But has this prevented juvenile crime? On the contrary, the US continues to have one of the highest crime rates among juveniles in the world.
 
It would have been better for justice if the JJ amendment had not been passed, if it had been referred to a Select Committee which could have weighed the various options, and come out with a law which is not one based on vengeance.(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            I have a sincere question to you human rights activists: whose side are you on, the victim's or the criminal's? Your claim of "brain developing till the age of 18" is rubbish. Anyone who commits a crime of rape, is party to a crime or rape, cannot claim he didn't know what he was doing. It is a violent crime and looking at the brutality of the crime committed, you cannot grant him the benefit of the doubt by saying he was a juvenile.

                            It's disappointing to see an eminent person write an immature article. The JJ act amendment bill does not lower the juvenile age. It treats juveniles above 16 equally in case of heinous crimes such as rape and murder(which have punishment of 7yrs or more) This act is so far the only real tribute the country has paid to Nirbhaya. Please cite facts whenever you write a critical arcticle.

                            This is amusing coming from elite circles. They are unlikely to face such issues with their families. For a commoner like me it makes sense that if an adolescent is capable enough of committing heinous crimes he should be capable of facing trial as an adult as well. CPI once used to represent the aspirations of the common people. Now they are irrelevant.

                            The CPM is the party with the largest number of young hardcore criminals. No wonder they will take a stance at variance with the national mood. A criminal is a criminal to his victim. What has age got to do with it? If you are old enough to kill and rape, you are old enough to be punished for it. All criminals are not amenable to reform, but without fail all should be punished. The certainty of punishment is the biggest deterrent. Compassion to criminals is a misplaced virtue.

What was your party doing for all the three years and the whole 2015. Why you and your party spearhead the case so that the juvenile who raped Nirbhaya excaped the amended law? In UK , USA and other democratic countries lawmakers take quick decisions and they come out successfully and we feel proud to quote them. You lawmakers are only to be blamed. Do not try to escape from this act.We Indians only know how to crticize but do not know quick implementation. We keep on discussing for years a simple point which can be settled in 24 hrs. Reason my country cannot progress. This actions do not bring votes. Please understand the grave situation we have been put to by stalling Parliament.<br/>

                            All the parties that opposed the bill, are usually associated with on the ground bullying to get their votes. Such acts are carried out by young adults who would get away as these parties will focus on youth below the age of 18. With this rule, these parties would suffer the most. Facts are normally quoted to suit the argument. Eg if person is over 18 and in jail, the ratio of poor would remain the same.

"On the contrary, the US continues to have one of the highest crime rates among juveniles in the world..."<br/><br/>
Being from the US, this is because here crime is REPORTED. In India, crimes are not readily reported, especially in poorer areas of the country. As more crimes are reported, the official crime rate will naturally increase.

                            It would be great if the writer actually reads this comment. We all know that it hardly happens, but I'm posting it only so that people who read the article know the full story and then decide for themselves whether this bill makes sense.<br/><br/>
Typically in India, when a corrective action is taken, we tend to over do it, by considering only the present in mind. Though I've been extremely disgusted, like so many others, to see the guy walk out free even after being involved in such a crime, I have spent considerable time in objectively analyzing the implications of passing such a bill.<br/><br/>
What was very apparent as I read through is that the article/writer is guilty of the deliberately not considering/revealing certain details to suit one's agenda (whatever that is).<br/><br/>
Of course, the accusations of the DCW were ridiculous. No doubting that. <br/>
But passage and implementation of this bill does not mean '16 to 18 year olds will be tried in the same manner as adults' and just that.<br/><br/>
If you look at the full text of the bill, it is quite clear that everything the writer raises as a concern is taken into account. <br/><br/>
Here is the text copied verbatim from the bill:<br/><br/>
 - The Bill permits juveniles between the ages of 16-18 years to be tried as adults for heinous offences.  Also, any 16-18 year old, who commits a lesser,   i.e., serious offence, may be tried as an adult only if he is apprehended after the age of 21 years.<br/><br/>
 - Juvenile Justice Boards (JJB) and Child Welfare Committees (CWC) will be constituted in each district.  The JJB will conduct a preliminary inquiry to determine whether a juvenile offender is to be sent for rehabilitation or be tried as an adult.  The CWC will determine institutional care for children in need of care and protection.<br/><br/>
So, for one thing, this is applicable for heinous offences. And a preliminary inquiry is to be conducted to determine how the case is to be taken forward. We know that adult offenders are not tried this way, at all.<br/><br/>
Knowing that the bill has enough provisions, I personally feel that it is not as 'illogical' as the writer seems to make it look like. That's my opinion.<br/>
But the thing with opinions is, one is entitled to an opinion. But it can only be respected if the opinion is formed after considering all the details.

The age of treating a person as juvenile is NOT lowered, but what has changed is the possibility of treating a juvenile aged 16+ as a adult for heinous crimes.<br/>
The bigger issue here is IF juveniles committing heinous crimes should be treated as adults. While this law may not retrospectively affect the Nirbhaya case, how many such cases should be enough for Parliament to enact the reforms?

                            Shame on you and your party. The proposed change in law is specifically for Juveniles between 16-18 who commit heinous crimes like rape and murder and you just want to poke your nose into it for your vested interests and for publicity. Nobody buys your stupid arguments any more, you have done enough damage to the country in the garb of civil society. Grow up.

                            The indian communist parties ,thankfully a forgotten one,specialising in upholding a brutal regime, where ever they were in power, are a confused party,with out any value.The communist parties are like a nice looking plastic replica of say, rice fruits,vegetables etc,meant for only a visual treat but actually useless for a hungry mouth.They only understand disruption ,for anything,with out any constructive role.<br/>
They support strike altering normal life process and in the name of supporting trade unions, supported successive pay commission to govt employees who do not work for more than one hour,supported bank employees who do not work efficiently,forced the govt of the day to increase their salaries astronomically,not knowing that they have increased the digitas  divide, fueled inflation,increased the level of corruption,and never allowing the situation to stabilize.<br/>
However communism is a discarded romantic thought process constantly dividing people and never allow human value to guide the civil society, and hence virtually out of power world over, and in china too it is waiting to burst at the seams, sooner than later.

                            Brinda you and your communists live in multiple worlds ..<br/>
- If you take the data of all adult crime, the statistics say they are 80% poor. <br/>
- If you take the case of pick pocketer with many children, poor as an example, when caught he MAY be almost killed, crippled for life <br/>
- If you take case of all cases of all cheating case by poor they are petty .. <br/><br/>
But all above are morally good, and might even report a henious crimes.. stating some international law, you cannot as communist take a view on the world's most populous democracy, with most unequal life styles <br/><br/>
You can have international moratorium of nuclear testing and can even sign CTBT but commonsense say, that we cannot have same criminal laws across all countries .. <br/><br/>
It is as a communists your real bosses in china, slaughter people if they have to for a dam construction and you talk of international laws for rapists and you wrecked woman talk of 16 and 18 age ?? I cannot say god forbid, Nirbhay did not happen, because it did happen but I can wish that victim were you Brinda and your daughter by 15 year educated and high society politicians son..  <br/><br/>
How my blood boils seeing you as woman..

                            I suspect such campaigns by impractical activists who want to save ' juveniles ' at any cost could be paid by some outside influence. it could be a case of sabotage of India's already poor law enforcement and justice system. On top of that there is a battery of people in all the time in the world to fight against capital punishment for most gruesome killers, criminal rights for 3 times good meals, yoga and bail on call. I have never seen them fighting for victims, witness protection and changing laws for better. I suspect their is a conspiracy to further destabilise Indian society by spreading anarchy through apparently innocent looking but sinister ideological miscampaigns.

                            Does she wants to protect any similar criminal ? For law loving citizens it will be discouraging to dilute punishments for criminals on basis of age. The criminal in Nirbhaya case and any other clean boy of same age will be at same level. Isn't it encourage the clean boy to commit crime without bothering society. Every criminal should definitely loose something in life as price. Most important aspect is victim. Rape like crime leaves irreversible effects for victim, criminal should be punished with similar effects for lifetime.

                            After 3 years of study/drafting/submitting the bill you ask it to forward to select committee. What is the guarantee that it will stop there. Some one else says it should go to some other committee and it never ends.<br/><br/>
You guys had all the opportunity to discuss in details and come up with flaws if any in the bill. But you did not allow the RS to run and in the end says it should not have been passed..<br/><br/>

                            Cure the patient not the disease- Increasing crime is a symptom of sick and uncivilised society. By just lowering the juvenile age and passing punishment bill will not solve the problem. If we want to defeat the crime, it is important to look at the root causes of crime. We all know the root causes that include terrible public infrastructure, gender inequality,  illiteracy, poverty, socio economic conditions, terrible law and order, deteriorating human culture and values, and living conditions. State has responsibility. State must take blame of not providing equal and quality education and assure necessary economic conditions to millions of kids who are deprived and forced to live in unhuman conditions that can leads to  terrible crimes. True justice shall be delivered to Nirbhya when we eliminate the root of causes of crime. Prevention is the only way. Government can not run away from its responsibility by just passing new bill- it must deliver its constitutional and moral responsibilities by building a just and equal society by providing equal opportunities to its citizens. I believe the bill has been passed in a rush keeping people's prevailing sentiments and gain political mileage. We need comprehensive bill that provide balanced approach including deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation, and clear state commitment to provide necessary means to stop future crimes. <br/><br/>

                            Madam, Your opinion is well written, appreciate your starting of statement as "India" NOT Modi or BJP (your did not politicize the statement).<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, when a Child is provoked with Adult act and behavior the Child in that person is dead - it is just the reference frame "Age" is left out.<br/><br/>
As a society, all of us responsible for the Child turning into that - it is a "Social Impact" or "Economic Speed" or "Financial Gap" or "Media Cult" which has contributed.  Statistically, the crimes which I could see from the reports in the media are belonging to certain group of people related to "Economic Speed".<br/><br/>
As a parent of a girl child, we need to have some sigh of relief and thought of protection. It is like a security guard at ATM.<br/><br/>
We need a tougher act to contain it now and not later when it turns into a bigger issue.  Thanks to all MPs in both the houses who did pass this bill to protect our innocent and tender girl child. <br/><br/>
"Well done Team India"

                            I fully and entirely agree with Mrs Karat. It has become fashionable in India to succumb to the pressures of the so-called "civil society" which shouts about issues on the basis of half-baked information. Law-making is serious business: it cannot be done in television studios or on the basis of a trial by media. Indeed, the Supreme Court should lay down some parameters and countours within which TV studio debates and media debates may be conducted, to eliminate any chances of the Judges becoming biased.

                            Me Karat and lot like her like rational talks, though they don't mind to indicate a political party while talking. Anyway, let me improve there highly questionable knowledge of Democracy. In democracy everybody had right to say his piece of mind, but decisions are made by popular mendate, or majority public opinion, and I am sure you guys are aware of these words.<br/>
So when decisions are made, laws are made or changed or update, it is purely govern by what majority is thinking (represented by someone who is just a popular choice may be 30% of voting age population). Don't go on 30% because 40-50% of Indian population doesn't vote and rest are influenced by 100's of available option and selfish motives... it's number game... but in any case fact remain unchanged that majority took the decisions.<br/>
So Me Karat you are actually questioning intelligence of Indian population. Moreover, punishment should purely be goverend by severity of crime and intent and not age... because none can say u r a dumb piece till 25 all of a sudden you got super natural powers and start giving opinion.<br/><br/>
I read you talk about highest crime rate of juvenile crime in US but you missed that US has highest standard of living which you consider as one of the influencing factor in Juvenile crime. You talk about poverty as one reason of Juvenille crime and forget to mention that in 30 years of leftist era in West Bengal actually industrilisation dies across WB, poverty increases many fold, poor people migrated across India, bangladeshi infiltration incresed (that again contribute in your WB loot).. and thus in conclusion your left party and as a supporter of leftist politics .. you are partially responsible for Juvenille crimes.. so as a grown up mature adult.. you should be punished, isn't it.<br/><br/>
So in your own language law is rational Crime and Punishment is just an extension of What if Scenario... and law reflect what society in general think.. for example Sharia in KSA is a law... and chicken heads like you never dare to raise a question on inhuman interpretation and implemetation of side of Sharia .. and I agree its law of land.. people accept it and that's why rulers survive.. so u accept it too if u r in that land.... In the same line if you are in India and if Indian majority (I hope you are mature and intelligent enough to not to read "Majority" as Hindu or Muslim) is not agreed with law it has to be changed... and nobody cares about what you think..... me too.

                            CPM in Kerala has always used Juveniles for their dirty political gains. I would encourage readers to check the stats of the number of youngsters who took to hate politics in Kerala which lead to many families losing their loved ones. Organizations like SFI used to destroy public property and were known for their misbehavior during the 80s and 90s. No wonder Brinda is against the bill. This shold act as a deterrent to those young minds and in turn help them develop as good citizens for the country and bring much needed solace to their struggling families.

                            "To consider the socioeconomic characteristics of the poor juveniles "?? What are you talking about?? How is this to be justified for the horrible crimes that were committed? How is being couple of months younger than 18 justify the actions?

                            I fully agree with Mrs. Karat. JJ bill has really been hastened. Maybe in future, it would be reconsidered. The humanitarian aspects were not considered.

                            She makes a valid point. When data has shown that reform indeed does reduce the rate of crimes in juveniles, how would putting them in jail make it better? senseless bill.

                            You should have asked to send it to select committee. And before we even go there was there any feedback or letters written by you or your party to the ministry...! I guess not!!

                            what were all the law makers doing when it was in abeyance for so long ? Instead of complaining and creating a ruckus on every topic, would it not help improve the image of the parties concerned to help make our Country a safer place to live ? It is so apalling to look at the bickering in the parliament, does anybody care for our Country's image ?
