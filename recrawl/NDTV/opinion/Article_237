Headline::::The Left's Sheer Desperation Shows - And It's Ugly



DateTime::::2016-01-25T13:50:00+05:30




                                Let's begin this column with a question: "What is the height of desperation?" The answer is simple: "The CPI(M)". Or rather: "The current leadership of the CPI(M)". A party that ruled and ruined Bengal for 34 years (1977-2011) is now desperately, shamefacedly begging around for an alliance, issuing appeals to even the Congress - all in a non-starter of an attempt to defeat the Trinamool Congress in the coming state assembly elections and somehow crawl its way back to power.
It knows the effort will be fruitless. Alliance or no alliance, the people of Bengal are certain to give Trinamool a second term as a well-deserved reward for what people recognise as the honest effort of the Mamata Banerjee government to restore the dignity and stability of Bengal, so sabotaged and crippled in the three decades of Communist hell.
I remember that period well. It was a time when one by one, so many of my school friends, college friends, business friends, social friends left Kolkata. Companies shut down; the best young minds of our state fled to universities and jobs outside; the bright lights of Park Street were darkened by the red flags of Communist trade unions and ransom seekers, hijacking a city and its vitality. Colleges were regimented with party whole-timers appointed as vice-chancellors and principals. English was banned as a medium of education in government primary schools, (though the comrades sent their own children/ grand children to the St. Xaviers and the La Martinieres) depriving two generations in the state of adequate knowledge of the language to enable them to compete for employment. The stories can go on. Kolkata and Bengal can weep for the lost decades of CPI(M) raj.
So could have Mamata di. She could have spent the past five years simply reminding people of the mess she had inherited and warning of the possible return of the CPI(M). Yet, she did not do this. Instead she persevered and made determined attempts to turn things around. Has she succeeded entirely? There's still more work to be done. Has she succeeded substantially and managed to turn the direction of the ship, dangerously close to crashing into rocks by 2011? I would certainly say so.
But it has not been easy. The healing touch - social, economic and political - after the 34 years of Communist dystopia is beginning to take effect, but gradually. We are still paying interest of Rs. 28,000 crore a year as a state government - servicing the Rs. 2 lakh-plus crore debt accumulated and left to us by the CPI(M) government. To give you an indication of that legacy do consider that the ratio of total outstanding liability to gross SDP is 42.9 per cent in Bengal. The all-states average is 26.5 per cent. In the past five years, any savings and surpluses Bengal has generated, the extra revenue we have earned by rationalising the tax system, has gone into paying back the CPI(M) debt. And the Communists have the cheek to want to come back to power!
Bengal was once a prized economy. That was before the CPI(M) wrecked it. In 1975-76, the share of manufacturing in the state's economy was 19 per cent. By 2009, when we defeated the CPI(M) in the Lok Sabha election, it was 7.4 per cent. In the same period Bengal's share of jobs in the manufacturing sector in India came down from 13.3 per cent to just five per cent. In the wake of CPI(M) raj, all we were left with were miles and miles of gutted and closed factories - and a small-scale industrial sector on the outskirts of Kolkata that had been throttled of its energy and very existence.
When such questions were asked of the CPI(M) and its self-important leaders, we were told all this talk about the economy and jobs was important only for the city elite. Kolkata was not relevant, the rural areas were, we were told. Apparently, rural Bengal was prospering under the CPI(M). I half-believed that nonsense till I began to travel deeper into rural Bengal and study the situation there in the mid-1990s. It was a Potemkin-like myth that convinced only CPI(M) cheerleaders in their pet newspapers, in Kolkata and Delhi.
What was the reality? Rural Bengal was a nightmare that the CPI(M) and its cadre imposed on poor, ordinary folk. In 2007, the National Sample Survey found that nearly 11 per cent of families in Bengal encountered starvation for several months of the year. This was the highest for any state. Odisha, where the starvation crisis in Kalahandi made national news since the 1980s, reported only five percent of families in such conditions.
Far from a happy life, rural citizens in West Bengal faced bullets and knife blades from the CPI(M). From Marichjhapi in 1979 to Nandigram in 2007 to Netai in 2011, the 34 years of CPI(M) rule saw 34 events of mass murder - one genocide a year. The government and the police looked the other way, or collaborated with CPI(M) cadre to murder ordinary people. From 1977 to 2009, there were an estimated 55,000 political murders. In 2011, the High Court were so exercised at the influence of the CPI(M) on the police that it took away investigation of the Netai pogrom from the state police and transferred it to the Central Bureau of Investigation.
In the past five years has anything even remotely similar to what I have described in the paragraph above happened? Can the CPI(M) and its intellectuals and tabloid writers contest that?
In her term as chief minister, Mamata Banerjee has diligently tried to rebuild the economy and make Bengal safe for investment once again. She has also tried to rebuild social capital, focusing on those basics: drinking water, electricity, roads,Â  health and education. There is much to write, but I will leave you with two sets of numbers.
Infant deaths in Bengal are an old tragedy. The CPI(M)'s response to the challenge was to set up six specialised neonatal (new-born) care units between 1977 and 2011. Trinamool has set up 49 such units between 2011 and 2015. But we are not satisfied. Deaths still happen, and each death is a tragedy. In healthcare, we have begun in right earnest but still have some way to go.
Higher education was once Bengal's forte. When the CPI(M) demitted office in 2011, it left Bengal with 32 government colleges. In the past four-and-a-half years, the Trinamool government has established 46 new colleges and 15 new universities.
Those figures tell a story. More next week.(Derek O'Brien is leader, Parliamentary party Trinamool Congress (RS), and Chief National spokesperson of the party)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Derek, under Mamata, the situation has only worsened, whether you agree or not. No development in terms of industry or employment or in the field of education is visible. Infact it has gone from bad to worse. A two way flyover is being used for one way traffic, need i say more?

Abhishek it looks like the only person from a jungle is you.You seem to be clueless about facts or you're paid to much by CPIM to come and post your nonsense. Looking forward to more eye opening articles like this. Kudos NDTV.

                            But, isn't the state unit of the Congress and several Congress leaders in Delhi also salivating at the prospect of an alliance with the Reds, for the same reason: somehow grabbing power? Why do you not attack the Congress?

                            The CPM was awful. And Mamata no better. Even today Bengal is a mess, and will continue to be so if either of these parties come to power. O'Brien is a rootless wonder and he can say anything he likes. But the ground reality in Bengal has not changed after the coming of the TMC and nor will it change with the TMC in power.

                            Derek, agreed that CPM ruined Bengal but have you seen what you ( trinamool) has done in the last few years. You have even superseded and increased the pace of decay in Bengal. I feel sad and I hoped that you would have risen above politics to point this out to your dear "mamata di"

                            I think bengal has worsened under TMC. CPM party is outdated and lead by backdated people.<br/>
What bengal needed was a open minded govt with clear agenda of getting industry in bengal. <br/>
Unemployment is the main problem in bengal for ages now. Show us what TMC did to get business in bengal. I think singur is going to haunt TMC forever as no industrialist would risk his money. <br/>
But how difficult it is to mainatain law and order if clear instructions are given to police to arrest criminals irrespective of their party affliation. Even that has not happened.

Every political party shows height of desperation to come to power, to retain power, to come back to power.<br/>
TMC too has shown it , not too long ago, its called Singur!It is showing now, Its called Dadra. It will show in future, have wait for the name.

                            Derek you were hero for many of us and I used to follow you on Radio. Encyclopedia and after that you were my hero. When I heard you joined TMC then I was so happy that people like you will bring a positive change.<br/>
Unfortunately when I see you commenting now then I see you a hero who has failed and more than anger I feel pity that rather than transforming the goons of TMC, you have become one of them.<br/>
Have guts to talk about Malda, talk good and bad of Modi, support what Mamata is doing good for state but blast her off for misdeeds.<br/>
I still have hope in you and India has the best PM so far that it can get so help Modi and criticise him when he steps on wrong foot. DO you think Mulayam, Lalu, Rahul, Kejriwal or Mamata as a better PM than Modi?

                            Derek, I do not see more desparate politicians that you, your didi, Kejriwal and Communists. While you cannot handle Malda in your back yard, all of you jumped to Hyderabad to make ruckus out of Rohit's suicide. BJP or its one Minister might be at mistake, but can you imagine the damage you are doing to the social fabric of vertically dividing youth across the country. Please stop these nonsense politics. If you guys can fight on development and improved life standards, as citizens of this country we will be proud of you politicians. You do not support GST bill neither tell exactly what your demands are. Please feel ashamed to stop the development of the country. Stop dividing country on narrow lines of religion and castes. please unite people rather than spoil the fabric. Today more ashamed to look at the educated young politicians like you, Kejrival, Jagan Reddy and Rahul Gandhi. I am really worried that the new generation politicians are doing still low level politics than seasond politicians like Lalu, Mulayam, Mamatha and seasonsed communists. Please for heaven sake  save the contry not just being power hungry.

                            While I do agree that the Left Front rule was the darkest period, the present change on ground has been marginal. How much MoUs have been translated into actual business? Has the brain drain from Bengal stopped?<br/>
It's still a handful of Marwari businessmen (not industrialists) calling the shots in Bengal. It's still the dangerous vote bank politics been played out in Bengal. It's still a government that's anti-centre. <br/>
Finally, as the saying goes, 'people get the government they deserve'. If the people of Bengal decides to give TMC a second term, it's their call. However, that won't change the reality.

                            good post Derek. I would also congratulate the effort that has gone in transforming a state plagued by bandhs and non performing babu's to one where at the least, the government machinery is functioning. this is a phenomenal change. however, a lot needs to be done in media &amp; PR management which are important vehicles of public perception wherein the only things that surface are the crimes &amp; how bengal is a lost cause. it would be good to keep on posting such facts and figures which can put qualitative biased comments to rest. bengal is doing great, considering what it was 4 years back.

                            One will agree to most of what Derek O' Brien has expressed.34 years(1977-2011) of continuous Left Rule resulted in approx. Rs 2,70,000 Crores of debt to West Bengal. Again, Left Rule of about 34 years since Independence,(although not continuous) resulted in approx.Rs 1,35,000 Crores of debt to Kerala. The similarity between CPMs in Kerala and Bengal have been forced outward migration of Millions of Bengalis and Keralites for Employment Opportunities to Gulf Countries or other economically developed states and in many cases, work in inhuman conditions in Gulf Countries. Both are Revenue Deficit States, economically surviving on Remittances received from Gulf Countries(in case of Kerala) and other states like Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra ,TN etc.(in case of Bengal). Being anti-Capitalist, per CPM ideology, CAPITAL(MONEY) should be shunned. But, when in power in Kerala or Bengal, CPM in both states SHAMELESSLY took long term loans (CAPITAL/MONEY) from different sources, both India and abroad to fund their Social Sector Schemes. If they have aversion towards Capital/Money, they should not touch or take Long Term Loans from others. Instead, CPM should first generate wealth on its own by working hard and then use the self generated money for Social Sector Schemes. First WEALTH or REVENUE CREATION by its own efforts and then REDISTRIBUTION of wealth towards Social Sector Schemes. CPM, should first giveup their negative mindset and stop being JEALOUS of hard working Wealth Creating Entrepreneurs like Azim Premji, N R Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, Tatas, Bansals  etc etc as they have contributed more to the Country by way of new Employment creation, Taxes, Technology, Charity etc. than 34 years  each of CPM rule in Kerala and Bengal. More employment and taxes are generated by PRIVATE Sector than Government or Public Sector.
