Headline::::99 Per Cent Cut-Off: St Stephen's Principal Says 'Don't Blame Us'



DateTime::::2015-06-17T22:00:00+05:30




                                "It would be a great disappointment for me," writes Ashok (name changed), a hearing-impaired applicant to St. Stephen's, "not making it to St. Stephen's and that too because of a very marginal differential." (Email received soon after the cut-offs were announced).
"Tell us how much more should my son do to get into St. Stephen's?" wrote an anguished parent on my Facebook page almost at the same time.
Tales of woes, narratives of frustration, grumblings of incipient anger could stretch out to the crack of doom.
It is such an infelicitous expression - this 'cut-off'. Sounds gratuitously callous. Akin, perhaps, to the butcher's art. What, who are we cutting off, for God's sake?
Our children, some of the brightest, earnest, keenest.
We can, perhaps, afford to be a little more humane in our terminology. Shall we cut out 'cut-off' in favour of an Americanism - "bottom-line"- overlooking, for mercy's sake, its bumptious banality?
I was groping for an image for this infamous and ever-ascending 'cut-off' (herein after termed 'bottom-lines'). Especially because each year many sound surprised that 'bottom-lines' continue to rise. Well, it could be like this. It is in the nature of water to flow from a higher to a lower level. But water ascends uphill if pumped. We overlook the pumping process (that remains hidden) and target the strange, unnatural behavior of water in going uphill. We look surprised. Even indignant.
Now to the bare facts.
Yes, 'bottom-lines' have risen in St. Stephens this year. Consider a comparison with the levels in 2014.
In economics, the increase is marginal as compared to the levels in 2014. There is only a .5 per cent increase vis-a-vis the commerce stream. All other norms remain the same.
English, I know, is in the news, though the extent of increase is exaggerated. There is a .5 per cent increase for the science stream, one per cent increase for the commerce stream and no increase for humanities.
In History there is a 1 per cent increase each for all three streams. Philosophy has registered the highest increase. There is a 1.25 per cent increase in the Science stream and 1.75 per cent in the humanities stream, whereas the bar has come down by .25 per cent for the Commerce stream. The shifts in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry are marginal.
It is obvious that while the bar has nearly kissed the ceiling, the extent of increase is both marginal and inevitable, under the circumstances.
St. Stephen's is a comparatively small institution. The best from around the country aspire to study in the College. As years go by, this craze seems only to increase. So, our "bottom-lines" may not necessarily be typical. But they still highlight certain issues.1. The issue of demand-and-supply.  For all the pious professions made from time to time by those who matter, this country still lacks the political will and sincerity of purpose to meet the exponentially growing educational aspirations of our youth. The fact that the enrolment ratio is still less than nine per cent should be deemed a national embarrassment. When you have room only for nine per cent of those who finish Class 12, you subject students from their early years in school to the anxiety of having to outperform in order to find a foothold in the rarified sphere of higher education. As a result, thanks also to the manner of assessment by school boards, they produce unearthly marks; making marks, in the process, virtually meaningless. So 'bottom-lines' will keep going up. Soon we will have to invent something higher than 100 per cent and win a Nobel in the process.  
One wonders what is happening to the thousands of crores the Government has collected as education cess. If we do not have enough colleges for a population of 1.25 billion, it is surely not because we do not have resources. I understand that the problem the Human Resource Development Ministry is facing is to decide what to do with the huge amounts at its disposal, especially under the head of education cess.2. The problem of quality. The agony that I am condemned to witness, year after year, of those who cannot make it to St. Stephen's - several applicants break down and weep inconsolably - is as much because of quality as of quantity. I have no hesitation in saying that the domain of higher education (here I refer largely to under-graduate education) is in a lamentable mess. Mediocrity stifles the promise of India in our class rooms. Worse than mediocrity is teacher truancy. Far worse, is the mendacity of managements. The environment that prevails, as a result, in educational institutions around the country is hardly conducive to learning. It is this, for example, that makes St. Stephen's weep at the time of admissions, for candidates from all over the country who pitch their hopes on this tiny institution.3. The problem of aptitude. What, if any, is the correlation between the aptitude of a candidate and the marks scored by him/her is a matter of some puzzlement.  Fortunately, the Supreme Court granted St. Stephen's the right to have its own admission procedure. So, we conduct interviews and do this part of our work with utmost earnestness. Interviews invariably highlight the scandalous discrepancies between Boards and even between candidates from the same Board. We denounce learning by rote, but design assessment formats only to encourage and reward the same. It is a rare student who, in the course of the interview, can even attempt to apply an idea to a context and say a word of two about it. The thinking ability is so under-developed! General awareness is at an all-time low. The "pump" that sends the water of "bottom-line" uphill is our school system, driven by a latent  intent to 'filter out' students through schooling so that higher education becomes a Darwinian jungle for the survival of the luckiest.
It is pointless, hence, to look at the so-called 'bottom-lines' in isolation from the larger context. It is hypocritical to keep lamenting year after year, like some sort of secular ritual, the malicious propensity of these apparently animistic bottom-lines to keep rising as though they have some atavistic scores to settle with the innocent school graduates. For God's sake, open colleges in adequate numbers. For our children's sake make them good enough to study in. Let us reduce the burden on our little children in schools. Let them have something that, in later times, they may be able to recall as their 'childhood'.
Bottom-lines are not the issue. A vision for the nation is the issue. Love for our children is the issue. Justice for our youth is the issue. A little more of honesty for ourselves is the issue.

                            Sir, please start admission test. Give 50% weight to school living marks and 50% to score in admission test. Your problem will be solved. Whether or not you are allowed to take an admission test is a different question.You can explore this option. I scored only 73% in higher secondary exam in West Bengal Board in 2000 but got admission in the then Presidency College, Calcutta because my score in admission test was very high. Greetings from Germany.

                            This cut off issue was always there. As long as you have exams and marks, then there will be cut offs when you apply for higher studies. Is there any better way? Changing the terminology will not change the reality. Generally speaking, the brighter and more industrious students get better marks. Which is how it should be. Life is not fair. This goes to prove it. Grin and bear it.

                            With such a high cut off, all these stundents must be winning Nobel prizes, this is all BS, there is not much intellectual difference between students who score 95% mark and 85% mark. How many of the Nobel laurates were topper from their school or university exam, the answer is almost nil? Their exploratory nature will make them naturally 'mediocre' in examinations since they will not be able to do rote learning as efficienty as a guy getting 99%.

                            All their talk about quality is restricted to General category people only. Quality is compromised without blinking when they take 50% students from the Christian communities at 70-80%. You really want to maintain/improve quality without being helpless about 99% cut offs? Do away with this reservation. Cut offs would come down by 2-3% in each stream and average quality of students too would go up!

                            The problem with our society in general is we are marks obsessed and what our padosi, mohalla and biradri will think and talk about us more than what we actually want to do in our lives.<br/><br/>
Big deal if your kids don't get into St.Stephens or IIT or IIM. Successful people don't demand the best of everything, they make the best use of what they have.<br/><br/>
So, stop obsessing about what college/school your kids go to and start believing in the abilities of your children, that, no matter what college/school they go to, they have it in them to be successful. As parents, if you start doing this, then you are enabling and empowering your children to achieve great things in life.

                            This is the real reason why the cut off marks are so high-Indeed demand and supply. I quote from the prospectus- <br/>
"<br/>
up to 50% of seats shall be set apart for Christian candidates. They shall be filled as<br/>
follows:<br/>
(a) 17% of the seats that are set apart for the Christian candidates (or 8.5% of the total seats) shall be reserved for Christian ST<br/>
applicants.<br/>
(b) 3% of the seats that are set apart for the Christian candidates (or 1.5% of the total seats) shall be reserved for Christian PwD<br/>
applicants.<br/>
(c) Up to 40% of the seats that are set apart for the Christian candidates (or up to 20% of the total seats) shall be reserved for<br/>
applicants from the Church of North India.<br/>
(d) Half the seats earmarked for the Church of North India (that is, 20% of the seats set apart for the Christian candidates or 10% of<br/>
the total seats) shall be filled by applicants from the Delhi Diocese of the Church of North India that manages the College.<br/>
(e) The remaining 40% of the seats set apart for the Christian candidates (that is, 20% of the total seats) shall be filled with candidates<br/>
from all other Christian denominations to be referred to as "Christian Others" (or COTH, for short). "

St Stephen cutoff is not national news. The rest of India, vast majority which lives outside the NCR doesn't give a damn about it. Please don't hype it. Have you reported the cutoffs for other government colleges some are even Higher... Get over this arrogance that somehow a college admission detail in Delhi is national news, it is not... Grow up.

The people who got 99% deserve an applause . Let's not take credit out of their effort. Other candidates do deserve good options but they should be more flexible than sticking to a named college or course .....Rest is the race of life ...who will move forward no one knows

                            Look at it like CLAT. The students with the highest marks applying will get in. I'm not saying that there aren't two-three cases of people getting in through power and money but that is not a standard you set for the entire institution. If you really think that this is one of the finest colleges in India, then they cannot drop down their "bottom-lines" when students are achieving higher results (Note:- If their "bottom-line" was 97% and 3000 students got that percentage, can they accommodate all of them?). It is a necessary evil caused due to the higher percentages received by the young graduates these days. There has to be some form of elimination (to thin out the herd) and unfortunately THIS is one of the only ways left. Happy Hunting.

                            Now comes the question of quality. A class full of 99% and above students will be taught by St Stephens's teachers who possibly never secured 99% in their life time and so do the so called 'father' or Principal. Can he tell us how much percentage he secured in his last exam? Ideally Why should a teacher be inferior in education than the students!! I am sure apart from religious quota this college has a lower cut off marks in recruiting teachers. St Stephen's will play the religious card as and get an waiver on quality. Rahul Gandhi is the biggest example. He was admitted possibly for two reasons: one he is a Christian, two son of a VVIP. No cut off marks no demand and supply reasons applicable.

                            People fail to understand that just by studying in a famous institution does not guarantee you success in any job or in life, so they keep running after famous institutes and waste their time.

I totally agree with your views. St' Stephen's was a the second option for me when I completed the "O" level Sr. Cambridge Exam in 1975, since Economics was not my preferred 'subject' as I was not too strong in Math.I went to Sydenham in Bombay. I think St. Stephen's may have made a mistake by opening up other streams besides Economics.

I forgot to add that Sydenham too had a cut-off ... only marks in Accounts was considered...so if  a person had 99 % in geography , commerce and english with a modest 70 in accounts....well he would not have made it to Sydenham.<br/>

This depresses the capability of true research brain and rather makes student to follow an idea taught by someoneSuch things does not allow students think openly with their own views and just follow something that makes them to 'learn' things in a strict fashion rather with their originality in explanation. There are enormous examples where students who never topped in colleges are in top positions on earth
