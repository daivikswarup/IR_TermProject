Headline::::Not My Idea of India



DateTime::::2015-10-01T15:50:00+05:30




                                Last month, I was reading Nathuram Godse's statement to the court in his defence of murdering Mahatma Gandhi. The statement published in the form of a book titled 'Why I Assassinated Gandhi' had me in a state of shock with Godse's justification of his intolerance. I was convinced that men like him were a minority, that Godse was a lunatic and the thought that killed Gandhi would not be tolerated by a civilized India.
In one of the paragraphs, Godse goes on to say, "I firmly believed that the teachings of absolute 'ahimsa' as advocated by Gandhiji would ultimately result in the emasculation of the Hindu community, and thus make the community incapable of resisting the aggression or inroads of other communities, especially the Muslims. To counteract this evil, I resolved to enter public life and form a group of persons who held similar views". This was the thought that killed Gandhi and deepened the roots of religious polarization and communalism in Indiasix decades ago.
On 28th September, the brutal murder of 50-year-old Mohammad Ikhlaq in Dadri, in Greater Noida, by a lynch mob of 200 people on the suspicion that he consumed beef has proved once again that the thought that killed Gandhi is gaining momentum.
Ikhlaq, who worked as a carpenter barely 50 kms from Delhi, lived with his ageing mother, wife, younger son and daughter.Â His elder son, Sartaj, an Indian Air Force personnel is posted in Chennai. The idea of India that Ikhlaq's son Sartaj was trying to protect as an engineer in the Air Force betrayed him and his family earlier this week.
By killing his father, and leaving his brother in a critical condition, Sartaj's nationalism was rewarded in the most ghastly, unthinkable manner. The modus operandi used in the murder was no different than those used by radicals in the past. An announcement was made on a loudspeaker that a cow had been slaughtered and its carcass had been found near a transformer. The rumor later spread in the village with WhatsApp and other messaging tools, something that reminds us of the method used by extremists and bigots triggering the Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013. Within minutes of the announcement, the mob had killed Ikhlaque and severely injured his family. As if this act was not savage enough, government officials sent the meat found in the house to ascertain whether it was indeed beef - the suggestion being that if it indeed was beef, then the murder of two sons of India was justified.
Yes, this is the new India we are referring to where we talk of a revolution in technology, where our Prime Minister visits the Facebook headquarters and we get encouraging photo-ops from Silicon Valley.
This is the new India where the Prime Minister a day after the murder congratulates his Minister for Culture, Dr Mahesh Sharma, on his birthday on Twitter, the same minister who just this month famously pledged to cleanse Indian culture of Western influence. While the PM has every right to congratulate his ministers on their birthdays (birthday celebrations being a Western concept according to the Sangh Parivar), it was shocking that he had no word of condolence for the family of Sartaj, a patriot serving the country. He had no word of condemnation for those savages and murderers who had brought cultural cleansing into action.
This incident comes days after revelations that the Sanatan Sanstha, another outfit with members responsible for the murders of rationalists, had intended to kill senior journalist Nikhil Wagle. In the last two years, three rationalists have been killed, the last being less than a month ago.
There is something very numbing about this. As I write this, I have messages from my friends who tell me they are feeling helpless, friends who believed that this country is headed towards extreme intolerance and they see no future for liberal, peace-loving Indians.
If this message had arrived a week ago, I would have ended up convincing my friends to have faith in the idea of India, but since Tuesday evening, I am unable to identify with my country. Is this the same country which I refused to leave for higher education, for better job prospects, for fellowships by suggesting that I would get homesick within a week of having stayed away? Is this the same country I defended when my NRI friends would mock its backwardness and ask me to move out for my own sanity?
My father saw my tweets on the Sanatan Sanstha a week ago and asked me to stay silent. He is becoming increasingly anxious about the outcome of my views which most often are critical of the establishment unable to contain the increasing bigotry. My friends are asking me to delete certain Facebook posts and tweets which they think might get me in trouble. A friend suggested that the next time I felt like speaking truth, I should speak to her about it than making my views public. 'You never know Rana, anything is possible now' she suggested in a telecon last week.
Something very strange and disturbing is taking place in the country .
There is an increasing intolerance towards what a section of this country believes is against its ideology. There is a lynch mob waiting to label us and shred us to pieces should we wish to disagree with the norms set by them. Let us understand that the beef-eating rumor is not the reason why we should be worried, or even a beef ban in some states which takes away a fundamental right from us. At the crux is the reemergence of the thought that divided this country that killed the Mahatma more than 50 years ago.
The kind of thought we would mock our neighbouring country for on most occasions. As I write this, I am nauseous, pained, ashamed of being a part of this alleged India growth story. This is not the idea I grew up with and the new idea of India has shaken me to the core today.
India, my country, my motherland, why am I unable to recognize you anymore?(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer.

                            We know it's not the idea of the peace loving Indians but Its the idea of Modi, BJP &amp; RSS. We have to live with these acts of intolerance and intimidation until 2019.

                            "An eye for an eye makes the whole world Blind" - Gandhi. The intolerance of one community is fought by the intolerance of another community.. Its not good for India. and India is not middle east. Communalism is not good for any community... whether it is majority or minority.. Secularism needs to be followed by majority and minority... Sad that one's eating habit resulted in his death!! what is the message it gives to his son who is defending our country!!!!

                            I truly support Rana's viewpoint and perception. PM must speak against the madness of Sanghis. Or soon we will the dream of progressing India down the dream. Enough of rhetoric "sabka saath sabka vikas". We  know how well Mr PM speaks but it is not going to work when the government is interfering in private life of citizens, on what they eat, what they see, what they read, what they speak. On one side we build India's image while these mouses damage the India's reputation of peace and tolerant nation with such a large diversity.

                            Anything can happen Rana because the politics of appeasement has finally made the country boil. None can justify what happened with Ikhlaq irrespective of whether he ate beef or not; yet, we need to be aware of ground realities especially in the villages of India. Sadly, you don;t seem to have the slightest inkling of how rural dynamics work. Its a well-knit society where tradition, honor and religion play crucial roles in shaping identities. So the slightest of scratches yield disproportionate results. Even small issues trigger major incidents especially if they are related to the subterranean realities of Hindu-Muslim relations. You cannot blame singular or multiple incidents as the symptom of changing times. If Hindu Right is gaining ground, who is responsible? The same Gandhi and his brand of politics that was continued by the Nehru dynasty. It may be 'secularism' or 'rationalism' to you and to all those who have congenital problems with their own identities; to a vast majority, it was plain favoritism and appeasement for the sake of vote banks. Last, but not the least, I have never seen you dedicating an entire piece to the brutal killing of Hindu families in Assam or elsewhere. It is this selectivity and then generalization that works in the other way and makes you look what you, perhaps, don't intend to.

                            First of all I condemn the act of the mob and pray for the family of the victim. Killing somebody because he/she killed a cow and ate beef is inhuman and outrageous. It is a shameful act. <br/>
It's not still clear that whether the person indeed kill a cow or not. Even if he has killed and ate beef I don't think mob has any right to fight him. If killing of cow is a criminal act (as per law of land), one should report such people to police and let the judiciary punish guilty. We are no one to punish people.<br/>
What I feel more sad is Ms.Rana jumping on this issue and criticizing Modi for it. She misses the fact that the incident took place in UP and SP is in ruling the state. In the whole article she doesn't even mention about the bad state of law and order in UP and unnecessarily she is dragging PM's US tour into this. Seems like PM meeting corporate seeking investment for India is not some thing Rana is happy about. She never misses any opportunity of criticizing the Prime Minister and spreading the victimhood feeling in  minorities in the society. Mr.Owaisi and the gang is doing the same thing in rude way and Ms.Rana is also doing the same thing in a highly smart way through her writings.

Any sane Indian should be deeply disturbed over the ghastly alleged "beef' incident.<br/>
This is the idea of a 21st century India, as envisioned by Modi et al!<br/>
Not one Muslim intellectual/Leader ( if there is one) has spoken a word about this,leave alone condole the family.<br/>
You have,as always the courage,conviction and guts to express your mind,freely and forcefully. The risk you are taking far outweighs the convictions and morals others lack.<br/>

                            No words could be strong enough to condemn what happened in Greater Noida. However, how does it compare with Godse? Remember Godse was child of his times - a turbulent times. People were killing people; even Sardar Patel said "If there is a cancer in one part of the body, it is better to cut it off to save the whole body." Was Patel a fanatic? For many hypocrites in India, it is easy to pass judgement on Godse and yet side with people like Afzal Guru. The former surrendered with will and his last speech at the court banned by "liberals" for many decades! So please avoid absurd reductionism like Godse was a devil and Afzal Guru a mere victim of his circumstances.

                            India is a country of 1.3 Billion people and some isolated incidents of mob violence do occur from time to time.  Just because there is a BJP government at the center, one need not jump to the conclusion that there is a massive saffronization of the country taking place.<br/><br/>
By and large India has been a success in terms of upholding secular values. Otherwise, the muslim population in this country would have diminished like the hindu population has, in our neighbouring country. <br/><br/>
There is no country in the world where minorities do not face problems in spite of the fact that the state stands for their protection.<br/><br/>
In fact, India owes its secular credentials to the religion of its majority population.

                            Let me tell you the tale of "thirteen-point-four".<br/><br/>
As a non-resident-Indian living outside of the country, one evening a few of us gathered socially at a friend's place and while during casual talks a query was raised about the percentage of Muslim population in India today, I equally casually said it may be around thirteen percent, having read it somewhere, and an Indian Muslim friend sitting next to me, who was highly educated and a banker by profession, exclaimed out saying "thirteen-point-four", drawing a mild laughter from all around including a Pakistani Muslim and leaving the Indian Muslim with a blush on his face.<br/><br/>
With two proclaimed Islamic nations, one on the left and the other on the right, being state-sponsored emptied out of Hindus, perhaps Godse's thoughts were not far from the reality.

"Religious sentiments" is a bogus argument, Rana, and I hope you agree with me. But every community raises this argument! Incidents like a pig slaughtered near a masjid, a torn page of Koran, a dead cow, all enrage a bunch of people and instigate riots. <br/><br/>
But I am surprised that you are insinuating that this is a NEW phenomena, happening only under Modi Raj. As if this intolerance is NEW and never happened before. I am surprised that you are asking Modi, not Akhilesh Yadav, to offer words of condolence for the family of Sartaj.

                            Responses to this article are in 3 broad categories: 1. We condemn this but why are you not condemning Hindus being killed by Muslims - Seems that one has to keep track of who is killing whom on daily basis and issue suitable condemnation to be eligible to condemn the killings next day? The Issue is not riots or crimes being committed, but the ideology behind these crimes is being mainstreamed by the ruling BJP and its cohorts. It seems as if the concept of Digital India is to ensure rumors and falsehood can be spread more quickly to wider sections to establish an alternative reality before any verified on the ground reporting can happen.  2. Oh this is all because of "appeasement politics" and the pent up frustration of Hindu community against the same - Seriously? Appeasement Politics? All surveys and government reports put them at the bottom rungs of the economy. What is the example of appeasement? can we get into specifics? It is not Hindu Frustration of appeasement politics, but a carefully synchronized messaging aimed at fear mongering and incitement that is at the root of this manufactured anger. This was always happening at a local level but has gained increased momentum once the main stream political party threw its weight behind this at the height of Ayodhya Movement. With the party in power, closet Godse Fans are increasingly coming out in the open, justifying the violence in the name of Hindu awakening. 3. Don;t like India, emigrate, go somewhere else - hahaha, what predictable response. Someone who is really proud of Hindu culture would rather say yes we are open to introspection and you need not entertain any fears that criticism would not be tolerated in this country. But some of our self certified Patriots who follow Pseudo Hinduism are bent upon converting this country into mirror image of Pakistan. Mr. Jinnah must be smiling in his grave with an I-told-you-so smirk.

Blaming political personalities or parties will only subdue the issue, as our politicians are masters in divulging things. The main issue is the mindset of extremist and their influence, with things like this they are going to become a group like ISIS in the our country where no constitution and law &amp; order is needed as they themselves are law.

                            Ms. Rana if you are not happy in India you can move to anywhere else in the world. You may go to Iraq,  Syria , Pakistan , Bangaladesh and so on where only good people are there and there is no Modi , RSS ETC. But don't politicise this murder in communalism colour. It's state matter of UP and secular govt of UP will take care of it. As a citizen of this country I condemn this brutal murder of a fellow citizen and expect law will take its course. Expect your views / comment on Muslim radicals in India and over the globe. Do you feel any pain on killings of an Italian citizen in bangaladesh by ISIS. INDIA is a Hindus place be amicably with them. Hindus are most tolerant community in the world.

I afraid this will result in equal and apposite uprising of extreme leftist. Only a momentous possession of power at centre has brought the reality of outfits like R.S.S. &amp; co. in open for everyone to notice. Every person belonging to the mainstream of India has a opinion that rightis in the secure and safe neighborhood are much more ferocious and ruthless than leftist in far away  interior and insecure heart land of  India. Question is - Whether leftist are ready to take on ever growing menace of rightis.

                            No Indian will justify any of these acts, and will condemn it unconditionally and equivocally. Anybody who supports Modi and his development agenda is not necessarily a Sanghi nor a bhakth. There are violent elements in our society who think their views about truth, God, women are enough to commit daylight murder of critics, couples in love, homosexuals, throw acid on women or rape them, or slaughter innocents. What we need is a sensible police force and unbiased judiciary, these things will not happen. Try and convict just 10 of these cases with speed and clarity and then you will see the change.

Where the world has not been broken up into fragments<br/>
By narrow domestic walls<br/>
Where words come out from the depth of truth<br/>
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection<br/>
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way<br/>
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit<br/>
Where the mind is led forward by thee<br/>

                            None of us so far knows the truth behind the story of Bilwasa. Therefore, it is premature to put blame on any one. Yes, any killing is unpardonable. Law should have taken its own course. That needs better spread of education in the country. So far as columinists like Rana etc, it is a piece of pleasure for them to develop hatred in the society by their writings , rather than creating harmony even in worst of the situations.

Where as the history tells that it was musleems who did not want to live with hendus and forced the partition of India by doing riots and then kelling lakhs of hendus at the time of partition.  The history tells that Godse took the extreme step of eliminating Gandhi because Gandhi was doing too much pampering and one sided support of musleems when the majority was seething with pain at the partition and mass murdering of their people.

Why these double standards specially when you have so many liberal &amp; secular Hindus always condemning these acts.

                            Dear Rana<br/>
I feel the pain as you do. The murder of that gentleman because of eating beef reminds me of the heinous AQ and Taliban. These zealots are Hindu Talibans and Hindu AQ. Therefore, I interpret each of your words as spits cast on the face of the Hindu Zealots. ItÂ´s so amusing that PM  Modi hugs the FB boss (less than half his age) while at the same time doesnÂ´t bother to say a word of sympathy toward the victimÂ´s family. Finally, bigotry wonÂ´t lead India to nowhere really. Only thing you can do Rana is to keep writing (read spitting on the face of the  Hindu Zelots)as a conscientious Indian and donÂ´t feel hopeless. Please keep faith in your country as long as you can. Moving abroad wonÂ´t solve neither IndiaÂ´s problem nor your personal agony, as a minority. Whichever country you might choose to emigrate, you will , unfortunately, always remain a minority, if not for your religion, for your skin or hair color. In India at least you have a "home". Keep fighting for safeguarding your home from the dangers of the claws of Hindu Zealots. DOWN with HINDU ZEALOTRY!

                            Rana - very soon you would be labelled anti national by the govt and policy complaint would be filed in some corner of the country to frames charges againt you and then the case would be transferred to CBI who would raid your house middle of the night.

                            Rana, your pain is shared by millions who think like you. Unfortunately, India voted for progress and development. But the man who was to deliver this rode on the backs of thugs and Hindu Taliban. Quite frankly, for all the sheen about Modi's glossy visits abroad, the country is getting less governable because politics is now reduced to numbers and the crass means to achieve this. Hopefully, India will have learnt from this disastrous election of people and parties who will make India resemble intolerant creeps in neighboring countries

                            The murder of Mohammad Ikhlaq rests squarely with the BJP's policy of beef politics. Instead of taking up any significant matter, the rascals at the helm of the party wants to take up sensitive topics and make them a big issue. North Indian Hindus, especially the UP-Bihar variety, have always been a wild lot, given to superstitions, casteism, racism, xenophobia, animosity towards south Indians, east Indians and west Indians. It is not surprising that such an incident has taken place in UP. <br/><br/>
While vegetarianism may be a virtue, it is a virtue that has to be enjoyed only by the vegetarians. It gives them no right to impose their beliefs on others. At best, they can try to promote the virtues of vegetarianism by means of propaganda and other methods. In this case, the mob only had objection to the family eating beef. So, according to them, eating chicken, mutton or pork is all right. Only if you eat beef, you need to be killed. This is a logic which will be accepted only in India. Go to any other part of the world, whether west, east, north or south, to any continent, whether other parts of Asia, Europe, the Americas or Africa, this concept will only attract ridicule. Taking the life of chicken, goats and pigs can in no way be considered lesser evils than taking the life of a cow. Just by drinking the milk of a cow, how can it be called mother? If that is the case, then why is the buffalo not considered with the same respect? After all, in most cities and towns in India, the milk that is distributed is mostly buffalo milk. There seems to be racism in this attitude. The fair cow can be a mother, but the dark buffalo cannot be!<br/><br/>
Although I am not a Christian, it is pertinent here to note the words of Jesus Christ, as mentioned in the Bible. Once Jesus was about to have meals at a devotee's house. He and his disciples did not do the ritual hand cleaning procedure which was expected of all Jews. The Pharisees or Jewish religious leaders who were present with him at that time, and who were waiting for an opportunity to find fault with Jesus, asked him why he did not do so. Jesus replied that it was not the food that people ate that made them unclean. The food that you ate goes into the stomach, part of it gets ingested and the waste goes out of the body. However what made people unclean were the dark and evil thoughts that resided inside the hearts and minds of people. These were the thoughts that made people do evil things, indulge in crime and commit murder. Jesus said that it were the hearts and minds of people that had to be cleaned for people to be truly cleansed, and not their hands. Needless to say, the Pharisees did not have anything to say to this, and their anger against Jesus grew. <br/><br/>
It seems that the BJP has opened the proverbial Pandoras box. Not withstanding all the theatrics and gimmicks of Narendra Modi, he does not seem to be capable of or willing to do anything against these kinds of bigotry. One wonders where all of this nonsense will end.

                            People like Rana and her group were supposed to be living in pakistan or bangladesh. The idea of India was created in 1947 with the partition that pakistan is for musleems and India is for rest of the religion people.

                            Did u ever thought about the idea of India when thousands of pandits were kelled and kicked out of Kashmir. Did u ever thought about the idea of India when a region in India was ethnically clinsed one group of people. Did u ever thought about the idea of India when native indians were forced to move out and out numbered by illegal bangladeshi musleems in Assam and changed the demography for ever and the govt watched over it ?

                            In this great nation now and under the very able leadership at the centre a cow will be saved and a man will be killed. A minister will worry more about dogs and immediately comment but will maintain studied silence when human beings will be killed. Another minister will dismiss the killing as a 'misunderstanding'. India is poised to achieve greatness soon.

                            I believe it has nothing to do with BJP. To destroy the image other parties have created this real life drama.  Beware of this plot. Also this has nothing to do with hindu , muslim as those who tried to help the family were also hindus!! So see the plot and act sensibly guys. Don't fall to politicians tricks whichever party he may belong to. Do what u feel is right to your consciousness and don't blindly follow  politicians. Apply your thoughts

                            The problem here is not so much if the PM should have commented on a "law &amp; order" situation or even why the meat sample was sent for testing. The real problem is the intolerance that is rampant in India these days, gone are the days when rational thought prevailed over hot heads. Knee jerk reactions, mob frenzy on one hand and gradual turning of India into a police state is what is cause of concern.<br/>
PM had an opportunity to come out and speak against this behavior (like the condoning of the murder by the BJP MP), but he may be too tired from his US visit.<br/>
He is fortunate that while in US he did not face the US media - on one hand he was selling Digital India and on the other hand he had banned Internet in Gujarat and Kashmir just a few days ago. <br/>
I am afraid under all the glitz and fanfare of development, the Indian spirit that kept India going for thousands of years, of tolerance of sanity of balance is getting destroyed rapidly. At this rate Godse may well find his photo on a 500 Rs bill in 20 years.

                            ever since the general elections there is a new wave of hindu nationalism seen in India probably because the right wing idelogy of the rss-sangh parivar seems to have been validated by the runaway victory of a known right wing sympathizer that is Narendra Modi.  This kind of validation has led to the extreme right feeling empowered and we see religion and caste based oppression in India that was not seen for a long long time.  That is why Modi was the absolute wrong candidate by BJP to nominate.  He never took responsibility for his inaction during Gujrat massacre and this lack of moral accountability has far reaching implication in the lives of everyday Indians

Since you are crying so much, do you also cry and write Opeds and blogs when news comes in from Bengal and Kerala and J&amp;K of Muslims killing non-muslims? I would be really interested to know.

                            Why is eating beef your fundamental right? That one line of your article tells everything about how you think.  Your NRI friends living in USA should be asking that question to you. They cannot kill pet animals or horses and by US law will go to jail. They respect the sentiments of people living in US why cannot you respect the sentiments of millions of Indian people.
