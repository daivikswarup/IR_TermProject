Headline::::#GoHomeIndianMedia - What Went Wrong in Nepal



DateTime::::2015-05-04T19:25:00+05:30




                                "Desi Media - Hai Hai. Murdabad... Murdabad..."
Indian media - this is a serious wake-up call! Pay attention to what Nepal is saying.... and change your offensive approach.
"Dear vultures, you've picked the bones of the dead clean. Go home now." This is but one of the politer tweets from Nepal that has fired up social media over the weekend. #Gohomeindianmedia has been trending with good reason. Let's face it It's time to own up and confess we have seriously s*****d up. Of course, not every journo is guilty. But most are. Why do we do this? We are serial offenders when it comes to antagonising our neighbours! We do it over and over again. Is it our arrogance? Are we such villains? Do we really not give a damn? Or are we just naturally crude, insensitive and clumsy when it comes to covering  tragedies - our own included?
The people of Nepal see it differently. We have a mixed history with our neighbour. There is the troubling love-hate relationship to contend with. It has been there for decades. Our patronising Big Brother attitude has always touched a raw nerve. The April earthquake and its aftermath have tested the limits of this fragile 'friendship' between the two countries. And unfortunately, the presswallas have become the fall guys - Nepal's favourite punching bags. We are no good when it comes to exercising restraint during such crises. We manage to do it to ourselves at home as well. But that is our 'andar ki baat'. We can deal with it later. Right now, the people of Nepal are reeling... and they are furious . They have an unprecedented calamity to deal with. The death toll may hit 10,000. Valiant rescue efforts are still on.
These will continue for months to come. Putting  the country together is  going to be the government's biggest challenge, with zero quick fix solutions. How does one piece together centuries of  heritage? The funeral pyres will continue to burn and smoulder, as families bid tearful farewells to loved ones. It is at such a delicate and difficult time that the people of devastated Nepal  are pleading for the one thing they need the most - precious privacy to grieve with dignity. Surely that isn't asking for too much?
It's pack up time for desi mediawallas. Our ham-fisted television reporters must put away those intrusive cameras and head home before they risk getting lynched by angry locals.
"How does it feel.... what are your emotions right now?" asked an ill-mannered reporter to a mother crying uncontrollably over her dead child's body. What does such horrifying callousness establish?
Well... a couple of things. But the most serious crime being committed in such a scenario is the obvious lack of professional training. The thing is, anybody can become a television reporter in India. Anybody! All you need is a certain level of (over) confidence in front of a camera, and the dubious ability to keep up a steady if incoherent babble. The pressure to 'be the first channel at Ground Zero' supersedes all other criteria. Professionalism be damned. This is amateurism at its clumsiest.
"Stop your media-quake," urged another tweet. But did we pay attention to the anger and anguish generated by our gauche coverage? Nope. We were busy in a brutal domestic war - the fiercest one - it's called the Battle of TRPs.
So... whose fault is it that we have distracted attention from the good work done by Indian volunteers  - the genuine ones - and become Public Enemies No. 1? It's not about hogging credit or grabbing the limelight ... a monumental human tragedy demands involvement from every person. We are morally obliged to ease the pain and suffering of the affected. This is what good neighbours should do automatically during an emergency - without a second thought. Without demanding applause. Without publicising the effort. Instead, we indulged in cheap chest thumping... we gloated and boasted. And Nepal holds us guilty.
Should Indian media apologise? Why not? If we have hurt the feelings of those we were helping, it's the least we can do. Nepal needs every bit of support the world can provide to get back on its feet. India's official response has been brilliant. It is the Indian media that has ticked off the people of Nepal.
There are a few lessons we can learn from the social media outrage. What our inexperienced television reporters need is a crash course in how to cover human tragedy. There are certain ground rules that must be followed. Nobody but nobody has the right to capitalise on anybody's grief. Cameras must stay away from mass funerals and display respect at all times to the dead and those in mourning. Is that too much to ask?
This is the perfect time for Indian media to invest in a constructive dialogue around self-regulation during calamities. Winning the TRP war is a petty triumph when what you lose is basic decency in the bargain.(Shobhaa De is an established writer, columnist, opinion shaper and social commentator, who is considered an authority on popular culture.)The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Thanks Shobha De for an insightful postmortem of what has failed India yet again- Media! This is also a good time to introspect into what happened in Kashmir last year. Exactly for the same reasons, human tragedy was sensationalized , and human emotions were flared to gain brownie points! The real heroes- locals who led the biggest rescues- remained unsung. Instead Indian Army, who led selective, limited and often delayed rescues (ask any locals-Irrespective of religion- they will tell you who were helped, where and when!) was extolled! Having experienced this treatment time &amp; again, Kashmiri people would have no problem with that, however, exactly for the same sentiment that has cropped up in Nepal, they could take it no more! These lines are not a critique but a message to invigorate self-introspection. Thanks!

                            Well deserved boot. The Indian media asked for it. In the shameless battle of TRPs you should not forget basic humanity. The Indian media does not know where to draw the line. Thumbs up, Nepal. You have dealt with your tragedy with grace and dignity. So sorry that the hypocrites in the Indian press could not. Our apologies.

                            Very well written piece. There isn't a single word I don't agree with. I want to sincerely thank Indian government, forces and related organisations that helped us in our times of need. Nepali people will be forever greatful to you. Also, it's not that we don't watch Indian channels in Nepal. Indian medias' style of reporting wasn't something new to us. However, it wasn't the time to mess with our emotions. Wrong place in wrong time. If not anything else, we are well known for our abilities to fight back. This time, you fell the victim. <br/>
The sad part is, media's irrational behaviour made everyone forget about how greatful they were to Indian government until the day before. That shouldn't have happened.

                            A lesson to media vultures using human tragedy for sensationalizing. Well when these same vultures were also portraying farmers suicides it's the same thing because suicides of farmers is happening for atleast 2 decades and never media was so proactive on this issue . Instead of trying to find solutions they only play to gallery of politicking..

                            It gives immense pleasure to read articles like this that acknowledge the ground reality. It takes years in building trust between countries and respect which doesn't simply happens through Diplomatic but through people to people.Times like this could have helped to great extend in cementing the relationship where there was gap created over the years due to multiple issues. <br/><br/>
Whilst the relief and humanitarian activities being carried out by Indian Air Force,Volunteer was worth mentioning and doesn't need to proved it through media which anyways would have been appreciated. However with unprofessional and inhuman behavior shown by Indian Media has done all the damage for its efforts...!!

India media (Ndtv included) should bow their heads in shame.It was disgusting to see how some reporters were covering the "so called news".Channel were showing the tragedy with background music and sad songs from old hindi movies. Media, if you not sensitive okay, but atleast be sensible!!!

                            Indian Media, one that never ventures into the space for justice to 1984 riots victims within India, went uninvited to all the way into the insides of Nepal. Perhaps that was the best way for Indian journalists to escape the summer heat at their employer's cost.

How many times have each of us felt to do the same when we see the screaming anchors/reporters repeating the same silly inane reporting.<br/>
Will these channels ever do some introspecting ? Please !!<br/>

                            Dear IndianMedia,<br/><br/>
We appreciate all the love &amp; Support from Indian PPL, especially the response from the Indian Government. We will always be Thankful. However, when it comes to coverage of such tragic event, Media needs to learn when to draw a line. (When asking a Question, covering Funeral, people crying &amp; so on.). With that being said, Once again Thank You India for all the help &amp; Support. <br/><br/>
Lets take this as an opportunity &amp; start the beginning of a good relationship between two Neighbours. Media please do not ruin this.<br/><br/>
Sincerely<br/>
From NEPAL.

                            Kudos to Shoba De for this well written criticism of vultures in the Indian media who bring disgrace to the entire media and the country. When they are censored, they cry foul and start lamenting about muffling media freedom and yet they are not able to exercise their freedom with responsibility. Talking about big brother attitude, it is not just with Nepal that India has this problem but with every other small peaceful neighbour as well. The people of these nations view India with suspicion and when they drift towards India's opponents like China and Pakistan, India becomes apprehensive. If India is to be respected as a regional power, then they should earn it by respecting the sensibilities of their neighbours instead of taking relationships for granted.

This can be seen on TV channels which we are forced to watch. All idiots discussing but the Journalist from TV- He /She think that they are best gift to mankind.

                            i have been following up the leading medias on recent coverage of certain events. How insensitive these people can be, only a sane person can tell. These people are shameless, just going after their TRP , media does not care about human values. take recent  event, Rajendra suicide in AAP, media did not even allow the family to grieve, they masqueraded and asked questions after questions when they are supposed to grieve. Does a human tragedy become an important tool to improve your ratings. Shame on you media. Nepal tragedy, rather than showing the destruction and help them get attention, media went too far. times india ARNAB, puts up street fights in name of debates, NDTV, follows the same thing but with a pretest that it is more decent. other media are biased in their reporting and has sided with some parties. These media even brought the intellectuals to their programs and used them to fulfil the TRP improvement agenda. please media, get some maturity. People will watch both good and bad and they give judgement in their own way- for politicians by votes, to you, by shunning the programs. you will lose popularity and die a slow death. mark my words.

                            Professional training is lacking in every sphere of public life in India. If you listen to TV debates, you will find out pandemonium breaks loose as everyone shouts over one another without making any intelligible  and constructive discourse. <br/><br/>
Journalists, politicians, social activists, ... all of them should be put through rigorous training program before they are certified to enter into public life. <br/><br/>
Nepal tragedy should be a wake-up call for these people to know that crass consumerism without any class and aplomb is looked down by people who watch from outside of India.

Have you seen the coverage on CNN.how patronizing is it..like nothing will happen till the Americans come or on BBC that appears only the western rescue teams are working..or the report in New York Times which seemed to be very patronizing about cremation. This is only because Indian news media is watched most on Nepal. For once, this has been the triumph of Indian media.

                            I'm pleasantly surprised at who the writer of this piece is. Its like a fresh breath of honest introspection, although I've little hope of any rectification. Sadly, Indian media has become as morally vacuous as most of the international corporate media. One only needs to quickly check the day's news (with several channels, so as to confirm that its not an outright lie) and click out. Watching the talking-head shows has become an useless exercise too - crass rudeness and shouting is all that's going on in these shows.

                            This time i agree with de , there should b ethics n code which media should follow . As media preach others about ethics codes n moral values the same media should follow it . Dear media would u cover da news if their is any tragedy in ur family or ur near n dear ones . Would u ask ur family members on how thy r feeling for lose  thy suffered . Media u too r humans , ur life is nt TRPs .

                            I am from Nepal. I came to know about this article from the link posted on facebook by a Kantipur Nepalese Daily correspondent.  The anti-India image in Nepal is more a media issue then the real issue. The main policy of Kantipur and many other media houses in Nepal has been to carry out anti-India propaganda in Nepal. This is not new as this has been happening since last 30 years. I am from Nepal and I am more then convinced that this attitude of our Nepalese media houses is not natural, I believe it to be sponsored by any or all of the western, Chinese and ISI outfits in Nepal. Rakesh Sood, an Indian diplomat during UPA once locked horns with Kantipur Publications for their continuous and untrue propaganda against India. But, he succumbed to pressure presumably from Indian journalists. You should understand that #GoHomeIndianMedia was a trend started by media houses in Nepal. The journalists and writers in India also supported and publicized this trend may be due to political inclinations or competitions. You should realize that many Indian links and connection prevail in Indian mainstream media that clandestinely support anti-India propaganda in India's neighborhood.   Anyway, I am happy that this issue is being talked in Indian media. Many people in India now understand the real situation. I hope India, Indian Diplomats, Indian people &amp; Indian media together will be able to find a remedy to a very old disease. As a Nepali, I thank you all for your unprecedented support and aid in "2071 sal ko bhuikamp". Before I end, I will say that Indian TV channels should grow above Pipli Live type coverage at home and abroad. I am not fan of Indian media, but I can't stop myself from speaking the truth.

Time for Indian media to introspect self to ensure that they do not overshadow the efforts of their own people and government.

It's similar to asking an overseas IPL player as to how it feels in India? Are these foreign players expected to trell the truth and berate India Another one: After a player scores a century, asking him whether his team will win. Of course his team will win.?<br/>
Similarly, ask Obama as to how his visit to India is and whether India is a more preferred partner to the USA than China? what a dumb question.<br/>
But then only India media cans and do ask such silly questions.

                            India did its best to help Nepal. Media also did good reporting, helping the global citizens understand the extent of calamity better and help in bringing much needed aid from across the globe. There is no reason to hate India or its media for helping Nepal. The above article is Nonsense. Keep doing the good work INDIAN MEDIA. Is it a crime to help Nepal? Is it a crime to report good work done? Definitely not.

                            Very well written piece. There isn't a single word I don't agree with. I want to sincerely thank Indian government, forces and related organisations that helped us in our times of need. Nepali people will be forever greatful to you. Also, it's not that we don't watch Indian channels in Nepal. Indian medias' style of reporting wasn't something new to us. However, it wasn't the time to mess with our emotions. Wrong place in wrong time. If not anything else, we are well known for our abilities to fight back. This time, you fell the victim. <br/>
The sad part is, media's irrational behaviour made everyone forget about how greatful they were to Indian government until the day before. That shouldn't have happened.

                            It is the total absence of regulations on Indian media that makes them so obnoxious. They can say anything, allege anything and get away with it. When their 'news' is proved wrong, they never come back and apologise. to add to it, the correct news is always on some ticker on the screen below while they outraged and debated it initially 24X7. Most of the 'news' is without any confirmation or research. If they are asked the source, they say that's our prerogative and we cannot reveal our source in interests of journalist freedom to report. Media today is having the time of their lives. They can do anything, report anything without any worry over the consequences. As soon as a 'news' is breaking, media has already announced judgements on who is responsible for what is happening. They don't wait for investigation to even start. Seems they are the cop, lawyer &amp; judge. <br/><br/>
Shobhaa De is right in what she has written but I can't help but wonder what if the tragedy happened in India and Indian's trended something like this. Would she still ask media to introspect or would she call those trending as bhakts?

                            Media always reached on time for news but never for help. many a times they are busy shooting, when some ones getting beaten up or in problem. stop asking questioned to the victims. In the process of getting their News and  exposing others the media people have lost their humanity. I have never seen any person from the media helping under  any circumstances.  Even the people of India who we  often see protesting for justice becomes a spectator when  help is needed. Its a real shame.

                            Well said. Just imagine, media houses send their celebrated anchors to all glamorous events. Only the new comers will be sent to cover the tragedies.

                            Very well said Indian media is going out of control and trying to make any news sessional even not thinking of its gravity. Many reporters or interviewers are so arrogant they think that a soft speaking person is stupid in front of them. This all got to stop and media got to introspect and improve too save their loosing credibility.

                            Isn't it true for every single "news" that our media brings out, whether it is political, social, criminal or whatever.... All the news are favored to a particular section of the mass.  Whatever happened to the unbiased reporting in journalism!!

                            Everything will be fine if one person is banned from appearing on TV. Don't think it is necessary to mention the name.

                            Thank you, Shobhaji for this courageous article. Media in general is a money making machine for most stakeholders. The big names have divorced with the core principles of Journalism. They are no longer neutral reporters BUT motivated manipulators. Shame on them.

                            If only Arnab hadn't been so loud, if only he was not audible even without tv sets across the border directly from the Times Now studio, if only the nation really wanted to know, India wouldn't have to see this day. Very well written Shobha, cheers and Kudos

                            What went wrong in Nepal is what goes wrong everyday in India at the hands of the media. Except in India, nobody dare say anything for they will hunt you down. No solid evidence, the bias is obvious, the self righteous preservation is absolute and no room for dissent if you are being cross examined. The proof is right here in India, the training ground for all reporters and journalists. Indian media will exact a similar reaction if they dare venture into every day lives of people anywhere in the world, not just Nepal.
