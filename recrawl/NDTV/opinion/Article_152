Headline::::In Defense of My Speech in Pakistan



DateTime::::2015-11-19T05:26:00+05:30




                                When I accepted the Jinnah Institute Distinguished Lecture for 2015 in Islamabad, I could have chosen a boring and meaningless topic. But that would have been a wasted opportunity, though a small one, in a saga of wasted opportunities between India and Pakistan.
As External Affairs Minister (my term during UPA-II), one is too bound by policy and protocol to explore innovative ideas. Now was the chance to try it. At the same time I was conscious that there are people in India (as indeed in Pakistan) who do not want peace or believe that they have a birth right over ideas about India-Pakistan relations. So if we want peace with Pakistan, or perhaps whether we should seek peace, we have no business to talk to Pakistan, but must pay court to these worthies of the idiot box. When they want peace, we must seek peace, and when they declare war, we should go into battle without seeking reason. "Into the valley of death...".
I told my Pakistani audience that five hours of interaction with the intellectual elite of the country to add some confidence would be hopelessly demolished at home by Arnab Goswami in ten minutes. Perhaps, that was greater impudence than giving the Pakistan PM credit for having tried! I might be faulted for anything but not for predicting the reaction of India's No. 1 'prosecutor, judge and executioner' package. I would have added ''grave-digger" but then he would accuse me of communalism in being partial to grave-diggers over pyre lighters. I found it strange that he still wanted action from my party; does he not have confidence in own ability?
Not surprisingly, the text of my lecture was discarded by friends and foes alike. One leading paper toyed with carrying it on their OPED page, only to apologetically surrender to growing right-wing opposition (their phrase). One Ms Lekhi of the BJP put me in the league of ISIS, mouth frothing with indignation! Surely, there is a difference between someone who rapes women of other faiths, takes sex slaves, enjoys slitting throats, threatens to destroy civilisation - and someone who happens to disagree with you. In confusing the two, the ''lady doth protest too much, methinks'' as Macbeth would say and indeed is showing signs of something called fascism. The Hafiz Saeed school on venality and violence, not to mention the perversity personified in ISIS, are the common enemy of humanity and would like nothing better than humanity beginning to fight amongst itself so that they continue with their destruction. I wonder if Ms Lekhi has received her bouquet of blood-stained thorns with a "tashakkur" from the forces of evil.
Meanwhile, I am still unclear whether inviting Nawaz Sharif to the PM's oath-taking ceremony, exchanging shawls and sarees with him, offering him biryani meals are fine, but giving him credit for trying to help is not; Atalji taking a bus trip to Lahore is fine, but addressing the Jinnah Institute is unacceptable.
My theme of the lecture was carefully chosen: ''Separated at birth or separated by birth: the story of South Asian Twins''. The main thrust was to question Pakistan's unwarranted claim regarding Kashmir. I did that by separating two conceivable elements of their claim: (1) ideology, and (2) political tactics. On ideology (concern with Muslims), I told them India has more Muslims than Pakistan, and they not only oppose Pakistan's claim, but have also sacrificed their lives for the nation as Brigadier Usman and Havaldar Abdul Hameed did. On political tactics, I suggested that three generations down the road from 1947, they needed to re-look at tactics. India and Pakistan have much to gain by going beyond the decades-old dispute.
If the BJP has a better idea, I will be happy to consider it. But if they do not, and the PM is stuck on some self-centered idea, what can the world do? Preaching to the converted is not diplomacy. Screaming at opinions is not democracy. The cheerleaders of the BJP are turning us away from the enemy of humanity to becoming enemies of the world of ideas. Humanity survives massacres, but the death of ideas is the death of humanity. We need the peace of homes, schools, streets, work places, not the silence of a grave yard or the quietude of lobotomy.

                            It's funny how NDTV is the only media house that publishes opinion articles of such morons. Mr. Khurshid seems to have a problem with everyone except his party and of course NDTV. He's desperately clutching straws to get some respect but has further squandered by just writing a mud slinging piece.

                            Why do you need to defend if you are so confident that whatever you said was justified? But I am really glad to know that you are a clever writer and not a duffer like your friend Mani Shanker Ayyar. Clever writer because you hid the main issue and blamed BJP for all this s..t. Didn't you say -"India has not responded to Pakistan's overtures for peace in South Asia the way it should have" and "your PM took a brave, farsighted decision. What we said and did made things uncomfortable for Pakistan after the visit"? And you justify this? I don't compare you with ISIS as they are stuck to their organization policy but you are worse as you criticize your own country's foreign policy just to win some brownie points from madam and her prince? Shame on you!

                            This nation may agree or disagree with NDA's foreign policy approach but let me tell you categorically this nation rejects your 10 years of approach (with only exception to engaging with Myanmar)<br/><br/>
1) So if i were to get this right, when you were in authority and really at helm, you were "too bound by policy and protocol to explore innovative ideas" and now that you have literally nothing else to do, you have donned your "innovative hat". So this benefit of hindsight of your failed external affairs policy with Pakistan makes you more smarter than the new government and hence you suggest this almost non-sensical approach that you self-righteously rephrase "re-look at tactics".<br/><br/>
2) The fiasco at Sharm-al-Sheikh of UPA to include "Balochistan" in joint statement was not sufficiently innovative I guess for you.<br/><br/>
3) Giving an exit route to Pakistan's ISI, that masterminded, incubated and executed Mumbai terror attacks in 2008 using LeT and Jamaat, a new tactic of coordinated terrorist attacks as against the "lone wolf" attacks was not sufficiently innovative approach to foreign policy i guess.<br/><br/>
4) Where was your innovation when Pakistan successfully "re-looked at tactics" to brand terrorists as non-state actors. I guess you were paralysed with "policy and protocols" when they were innovating terrorism and its new forms.<br/><br/>
5) What was your strategic response to beheading of an Indian soldier at LoC by LeT terrorists that crossed LoC under the cover of fog and Pakistani Rangers. An ungrateful government led a nation ungrateful towards its very own soldiers led by your mute prime minister was quite innovative "tactically" in registering its protest to High commissioner of Pakistan in New Delhi. You must have felt great in ticking one more check-box of following "policy and protocols" because afterall you were helpless. You might want to check what Israel did when Hizbollah captured two of its soldiers and response of US army when its soldiers were captured by Taliban in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>
6) And I am not even talking about your laughable foreign policy towards China when all you could do was regsiter protest with Chinese ambassador in Delhi when People's Republic Army was crossing Line of Actual Control at Ladakh sector. You were i guess innovating while sleeping.<br/><br/>
7) Smoke your pipe and spare this nation from your innovative foreign policy/ies. Congress under Nehru, Shastri and Indira administration at least had a respectable vision but Manmohan Singh and his cabinet comprised of minister's like you were like headless chicken. No idea of how to deal with Pakistan or even a friendly country like Sri Lanka under Mahindra Rajapakse.<br/><br/>
And seriously you draft your policy and ideology keeping Arnab Goswami in mind ! <br/>
That's definitetly a " relook at your tactics" because last time Lord Rahul Gandhi (saviour of all Indians) wasn't tactful enough with Arnab.<br/><br/>
My sympathies for your defense.

                            It may be easy to talk a lot about BJP but author was quoting the examples of Atal initiating Samjhouta express and Modi inviting on PM Swear in ceremony. There were no other initiatives from Non-BJP Govts to quote. BJP is branded as anti-Pakistan but it was the party which atleast tried a few things very early of their tenures. If Sharif or Musharaf wants to speak to separatists first rather than the country head and if they are still praised about "More keen" about the resolution, there is something wrong consistently with our so called Intellects. Pakistan refused to invite J&amp;K Speaker when talks were initiated again. Do they reject to accept the democratically elected J&amp;K and accept only separatists? And when our great intellects keep making these statements against Indian Govt I feel we have more enemies within our country.

                            There is nothing wrong in initiating peace talks with Pakistan. I thought then Prime Minister AB Bajpayee did just that by starting Samjouta express and visiting Pakistan but then Kargil happened right after that so what's the point.

Both happened after your heroic statement in Pakistan. Shocked to hear your views on Shariff attending the swearing ceremony and eating biriyani. As ex. external affairs minister you are well aware that India has to observe certain diplomatic protocals, even if to Nawaz Shariff. But you are equating that with your action of taking a opposite view of our foreign policy that too in Pakistani soil!! By the way, the whole world is comparing the Paris incident with Mumbai 26/11, the mastermind of which was stitting probably not very far from where you gave the lecture.

Especially at a time when Pakistan, a country which wiped out all other minority religions, is busy exploiting few recent episodes to blanket entire India as an anti-Muslim Hindu extremist country? They used you as a pawn that helped serve their agenda. We may bicker and fight internally, but beyond the borders we have one Prime Minister and one foreign policy. As a member of the opposition party and former minister of external affairs, you did a disservice to this nation by undermining both. Shame on you.

                            Unfortunately the Congress party has nothing to show on Indo-Pak relations in its 60 years in power except 26/11 and a number of bombing incidents that claimed innocent Indian lives because Pakistan rightly believed that India under UPA would not react in their mistaken belief of vote bank politics. The Congress &amp; Khurshid are least qualified to question the present goverment's policy since their own record was disastrous.

                            There is a tendency by congresmen and liberals to equate India and Pakistan. They ignore that Pakistan is fomenting trouble in India not the other way. They ignore Pakistan is Muslim country and India is secular country. They have been able to solve the problem in last 60 years but still have guts to criticize Modi. FOr the first time, Indian Government has taken decision not to talk to Pakistan unless they fulfill some conditions, what is wrong in that. If Pakistan is so een on peace, let them fulfill those conditions.

                            I had more respect for Salman before his speech and this writeup hurts him even more. Let us recognize that the Pakistani elite are manipulators of the truth par excellence. The Diwali ads in Pakistani papers is a manipulative attempt to cash in on Modi's troubles with the Indian press. That said, telling Pakistanis that Modi isn't doing enough is to give them a handle to whip the Indian PM, and hence India. I expected better judgment from Salman. Also please recognize that apart from coming to India and Ufa, Nawaz has been under the control of the military. So to pretend as if Nawaz is the one calling the shots is to give Pakistan credit where none is due. The action of meeting the Hurriyat is a clear example of bad teamwork on the Pakistani side. But the bottom line is: even if you hate your PM, don't forget the people elected him. You don't have to support him, but when you attack him on Pakistani territory, you attack India.

                            Political wisdom is missing in our generation of politicians. If we take the account of contributions of Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr.Bhimrao Ambedkar, Kamraj, EMS Nambudripad, Madalmohan Malviy, Jyoti Basu, Bhai Dange, Radha Krishnan, Somnath Chatterji, Indrajit Gupta, Atal Bihari Bajpai, we don't find that class and intellectual competancies in present generation. Its basically lack of charactor and values are different. Whethr if these above mentioned stalwards and legends would have survived under the leadership of current generation of party suprimo such as lalu yadav, mulayam yadav, mayawati, sonia gandhi, amit shah, jailalitha, sitaram yechuri. <br/>
If Indians expect curent generation of politicians to deliver same intellectual standards policy or visionary statements then its like expeting cowboy to fly aeroplane without skills/training.

And same people of India gave massive mandate to Modi so please allow him to deal with pakistan. As a matter of fact his foreign policy is till date the best one we ever had. Wat was your achievement as external affairs minister can you name one good thing you did in your entire tenure? Don't try to undermine democratically elected govt.

1. Defended the now banned organisation SIMI and got the right treatment from Supreme Court of India. Only a greedy communal person can think of this.<br/>
2. At Azamgarh, made a statement that Congress president Sonia Gandhi cried for the death of terrorists during Batla House Encounter. Then realised that UP public would not fall prey to this and then retracted his statement.<br/>
3. All of us know about the Zakir Hussain Memorial Trust embezzlement. <br/>
And this time he took is dirty habit a bit too far. You would not be scoring anything in India for your dimwitted statements.As some of the comments, you have milked the country enough and its time you and your other block head friend(MSA) retired from politics.

So Mr Khurshid you know now that what kind of confidence you and your Congress party has tried to create in Pakistan in the last 10 years. But Mr Khurshid, you have forgotten to say that the same Pakistan never tried to create confidence in Indian politico. Have you or your party ever tried to extract the same from Pakistani establishment? A big NO. You are defending yourself by writing article means you said something that many could not understand in India including you patry colleagues. So they stopped defending you as they do not know exactly what you said or what you said was not the view of many in India including you party. When we do not control our tongue and use excess intelligence, these kind of problems do occur. Careful in future.

This will be again packaged as intolerance if denounced and congress has in fact shown its hand once again reminding us of its similar pro pak tendencies during partition. Many in congress like mani will appease pak if only to demonstrate their secular and high moral standards which only exposes the deep seated anti majority feelings that they have nutured over the years. We may soon hear from congress that pak is more democratic than bjp and modi india.

How independence and freedom are being abused by these people in power and authority. I pity my self,I pity my country's helplessness and I pity us the indians. Democracy in this country has become- just an act of voting once in 5 years or so. We are forced to depend on these people to control our nations security and honour.

                            stand by u Mr.Khurshid.either war or peace with pakistan is in india's interest<br/><br/>
this slow politics will only empty our revenues and make our weapon suppliers richer<br/><br/>
we are still not mature enuf to look beyond hate and act to our common interests<br/><br/>
we indians  are better poised n matured.but not many matured as u and mani sir.critics may hate u but when sense prevails they will some day know what was good for our development

                            Dear Salman Khurshid:<br/><br/>
You can have your opinion in line with the stand of the country - which you claim to do, by way of referring to your past government position and that too none less than the position of Minister of External Affairs. During all the years you and your party were in power, you experienced how difficult and insincere was Pakistan and the total absence of a responsible leader - either from the government or the military to talk to. No one in Pakistan - government and military - ever want to live peacefully with India - that, the end of hostilities with India, would be the end of the hegemony that they both - political leaders and the military - successively enjoyed, because the raison-d-etre would have disappeared.  One need not tell this obvious fact to a person who and whose party has spent long years in the government.  India always ends up never-ending circles - as far as its dealings with Pakistan - when you were in power, the party in opposition always insisted on the government to take hard position.  Surprisingly, purely out of cheap political gains and by paying scant regard and respect to the country's national interests, you and your party have been advocating negotiations with Pakistan.  This is a total dishonesty and borders on treachery. That is, giving up national interests, that were precisely its own when it was in power, and asking the present government to give up everything and appease Pakistan.  <br/><br/>
Your unrelated to the main issue references about "grave digger vs. pyre lighter" and again "grave like peace,"(you should have mentioned grave and pyre like peace" to be politically correct) and another reference to Ms. Lekhi being the "cheer-leader", are statements that were made with the utmost disregard of and a complete show of disrespect to the Bharatiya culture, tradition and beliefs - first, "pyre-lighters" are NOT PAID PROFESSIONALS - they are the sons. So, to talking about "pyre-lighters" very casually shows your arrogance and disrespectful character.  Second, Ms. Lekhi, who is in the government as a senior minister, only chipped in in this very specific and special, sensitive issue - viz., relations with Pakistan and an Ex-MEA Union Minister talking in an "enemy" country in praise of its leaders while disparaging and discrediting his own country and the government in power. It was commendable for Ms. Lekhi to intervene rather than respond to you through the usual spokespersons, who are there regularly on all issues.<br/><br/>
It is absolutely sad to see a man of your (self-proclaimed) stature who was a long-standing face of the Congress to behave in a deliberate and treacherous[to the country] way that you did along with another of your calibre.

                            Indo-Pak relations. Excellent at level of individuals, terrible at government level. Why?

                            It is a pity that the media is approving, supporting and promoting the congress leaders who speak ill about the country and its PM, support ISIS and its brand of terrorism. On the other hand one small statement by a district level functionary of BJP, made in front of 10 supporters, is turned into a shrill national campaign against "intolerance" and a platform is created for congress to stage a recovery by 2019. The Indian public will fall for this media sabotage of an elected government? Media has to learn by their foreign counterparts, about responsible, mature and knowledgeable coverage of news.

                            Why all preaching and ideas are centered around Muslims? Why nobody cared/ cares about Hindus and Sikhs who choose to be in Sindh, Peshawar, Lahore, villages of Pakistan and Dhaka but eliminated from 30-40 in 1950s to less than 1% today?

                            Completely unimaginative speech that lacked in analytical rigor and eloquence what it amply made up in the misplaced self-regard this ordinary thinker has as regards his presumptions for his station and intelligence. One does not critique one's PM on foreign neutral ground, far less in non-neutral grounds especially with a nation that's global headache number 1, as very aptly put by Hilary Clinton. And to do this without eviscerating Pakistan's policy of terrorism and duplicitous-ness that its followed all these years is just rank opportunism and the worst kind of obsequiousness not worthy of ex-FMs of India. Really, shame on him.
