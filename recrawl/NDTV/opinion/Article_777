Headline::::Delhi's Electricity Scam - What AAP is Missing



DateTime::::2015-08-24T15:59:00+05:30




                                Everything Mr. Ashutosh writes about the AAP perseverance to ensure that the power companies run by Reliance and Tatas were subjected to an audit by the CAG is true. It is absurd for either the Congress or the BJP to now claim that they had the same policy.
According to the first reports of the CAG audit, the culpability of the Sheila Dikshit Government in the (estimated) 8,000 crore fraud seems to be well-established. It cannot be a coincidence that every time important policy decisions were to be taken, the government-nominated Directors on the Board, according to the CAG report, were conveniently absent. Not once but several times. Why should any Government permit such obviously pro-company behavior from its nominees? This is clearly connivance.
Ashutosh is also right in criticizing the BJP and Congress demand for a CBI probe into the CAG findings. When there is prima facie evidence, the companies concerned should be directly charged and prosecuted. There could be an independent inquiry into one aspect of the report, that is, the nexus between the companies, the then ruling party leaders and a section of the bureaucrats, so as to identify and prosecute the individuals involved.
However, two important issues emerge from the AAP position as articulated by Mr. Ashutosh which require reconsideration by the AAP leadership if it is not to be an exercise in self-praise.
The first is a fundamental issue of his party's approach towards the responsibility of the Government in the provisioning of essential services to the people. The AAP position is "it was not against the privatization of electricity, but companies should not be allowed to loot in the name of privatization." Thus there is no difference in the policy approach towards  supplying electricity in the Capital between the AAP, the BJP and the Congress. They are all agreed that it should be handed over to private companies, and certainly none of them will say that they are for loot in the name of privatization.
AAP has further articulated its position by asking the Centre to cancel the-long term contracts with the Reliance and Tata Discoms (power distribution companies) and allow the AAP Government to give the contract to other companies, who presumably would not "loot" and agree to terms more reasonable to consumers.
AAP support to Congress and BJP policies of privatization of essential services flies in the face of global experience about privatization in the electricity sector.
There is more than adequate literature available of the experience of the dozens of countries which in the 80s and 90s started the privatization processes of electricity generation and distribution. The general reasoning to push privatization was similar to that used to privatize the Delhi Vidyut Board: to improve "economic efficiency",  to "rationalize" (read retrench) the workforce, to improve technology, to check wastage in transmission, to ensure correct meter measurement of use of electricity etc. all in the name of reform.
But as described by analyst Sharon Beder ten years ago "The blackouts from California to Buenos Aires to Auckland, government bailouts to companies in California and Britain, electricity rationing in Brazil, and the fact that it is too expensive for millions of people from India to South Africa" soon showed up the fallacy of the privatization reasoning. In the light of global experience, the very institution which had been pushing for privatization, the World Bank had to admit in its report in 2013 " It is difficult to find consistently beneficial effects of the reforms actually implemented in many countries." (quoted in David Hall, Global Experience with Electricity Liberalisation, Dec. 2009).
In the light of post-privatization realities, many countries which had been at the forefront of handing over publicly-held power utilities to the private sector are reversing the processes of privatization and taking over the companies. These include countries in Latin America like Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and also many provinces in the United States and municipalities in Germany.
In India, we have the example of the failure of the privatization of electricity distribution in Odisha,  which was  the earliest state in India to privatize. Four distribution companies were created and privatized in 1999, with US-based AES Transpower taking over one, while BSES (Now Anil Ambani's Reliance Infra) took over the three other discoms.
AES walked out in 2001, after refusing to restore transmission and distribution lines to rural areas after the Orissa cyclone. Recently, the state power regulator - Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission - revoked the licenses of Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Infra for gross failure, stating, "Even after 15 years of operation, the licensees have consistently failed to run the enterprise in a commercially sustainable manner." The Odisha government, a strong votary of privatization, had to follow their advice. Remember when Mumbai was flooded in 2005? The areas where private power companies operated remained in darkness for seven days. State-owned utilities provided power within 24 hours.
Why does AAP not pay heed to these experiences? It is a myth being sold by AAP that it is going to find private companies which will act differently.
A differential rate for electricity users with cheaper rates for those below a particular cutoff - in the case of Delhi, 400 units - certainly brings relief to the poorer sections. After Delhi under AAP took this step, it has led to the halving of the bills for such users. But this will not protect such users against the inevitable rise of prices if electricity remains in the hands of private companies.
The second question that arises is  has the AAP or the Delhi Government  dialogued with Delhi-ites on its support to privatization? It would appear that the democratic exercises that AAP projects as its USP are confined or limited to selective issues that do not require a fundamental change in the policy frameworks of the Congress or the BJP.
It is only when electricity is seen as an essential service and is the responsibility of the Government that  the loot of thousands of crores of rupees as exposed  by CAG will not be repeated. The AAP and the Delhi Government should take the only logical step, which is to re- takeover the electricity utilities. Essential services for the well-being of the people cannot be held ransom to the profit-hungry private companies.(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Give the discoms to Brinda so that the communists can run it the way it is in communist countries.This way only the party cadres can make billions as they did since the WWII in Eastern Europe, USSR, China, etc.,  before they were thrown out by the public out rising in all countries except China. Communism is surviving in China by brute force and it is more capitalistic than Europe, except that the power rests only with the party. In China to which CPM is loyal, the communist party is having the cake and eating it too.

                            Yes, Madam Brinda, it is very easy to criticise from outside. Do you know the state of the electricity boards in Kerala and Bengal where the CPM ruled for decades? Please find out about the Lavlin scam in Kerala where the CPM's Pinarayi Vijayan is one of the accused in a Rs. 100 crore scam. Then pass stupid observations on others. And conduct performance audits. The future of all public utilities lies in the private sector, as the public sector is inefficient, wasteful and politicised. You need strong regulators who know how to do their job. PSU utilities have always been a drain on public resources, and is a backward regressive step to go back to them. The CPM supporting the AAP. Now that is really rich!

                            Agree completely with Ms Karat- a very well articulated argument against privatisation of discoms where all these "bania" capitalists if India only want to make money by trading electricity and do not want to invest in rural India.<br/><br/>
The fact that both the BJP and the Congress are just two sides of the same coin is well known and their reactions after the CAG Report shows they are merely trying to protect "their capitalists". What Ms Karat has highlighted is that AAP in turn is trying to promote another bunch of banias, who add no value but want to make money any which way.

                            In principle, what Ms. Karat says is OK but given our horrific experience with the public sector and babus, it is probably best that honest fair contracts with the private sector is best. The public sector and it's babus appear to have only one purpose in whatever they do - humiliate and give the public as much trouble as they can.

                            @Those who are supporting privatisation. If you really believe in privatisation - that they are more efficient etc. - ask the private companies to start from scratch, build their own infrastructure. In most of the countries, private companies are doing business on the infrastructure built by Govt. over 100s of years. All the infrastructures will be set up by tax payers money and then the cream (profit) will be taken away by private companies - what type of fairness is it. The elitists and the upper middle class may be happy about privatisation so far as they are able to bear the slight rise in cost of the service. But imagine, if the companies would have required to build the infrastructures for electricity supply from the scratch, how expensive the service would be - many of you pro-privatisation guys wouldn't be able to bear it.<br/><br/>
If you ask the private companies to build their own infrastructure and compete with the govt companies - see how many of them will be interested in business.

                            The communist ruled state of west Bengal had perennial shortages of power. Majority of the power generating units were either shut down or dilapidated - thanks to CPI/CPM Trade unions. The only business of government is "governance". Governments should not be in the business or doing business.

                            Ms Karat has a point but like all political parties she also preaches something but does not practice it. I would like to remind Ms Karat that CESC ( Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation ) is held by a private entity, which has the sole responsibility of supplying power to the whole of Kolkata. This changes were done in the late 1970s and early 80s by Jyoti Basu govt when there was no concept of privatization in India.<br/><br/>
I am not in favor/against privatization. For example the Goenka's who own CESC were once anti Mrs Gandhi, hence it is OK to hand over the power distribution, hospital ( read AMRI) etc to all such people. Ms Karat would do well to dust the skeletons in her own backyard and then accept responsibility and then preach. This is not petty cadre who has deviated from party line. This is much more than that. An official policy of a communist party led govt who would now claim that they could not keep something in public hands in the state where they ruled for the reasons best known to them. <br/><br/>
We Indians have this very bad notion of preaching something and practicing something else. The news on OROP as well as this shows that. I hope Ms Karat will get sometime from her schedule to read my comment.

                            Where there is space to be filled, one can always be sure that Brinda will fill it, no matter how much she is lacking in merit on any subject she writes on.  Such lack of merit was laid bare when she claimed to the world that Tata were trying to swindle their British workers of a 'whopping £100,000' (her words)in a pension related matter.  Those with even a modicum of knowledge of the pension system in Britain could only wonder at how such a nincompoop could be given space in a serious news channel.  Other examples of her empty head making loud sounds include her taking the Norwegian government to task for taking an Indian child into care only for the truth to emerge that the child was indeed being abused by its parents.  Now she will have her say on the merits of electricity supply.  Quoting Sharon Beder and David Hall, both officials of minor foreign universities does not make her bogus case any better.  The fact that there were dodgy directors on the boards of electricity suppliers and that the electricity companies overcharged is no reason for nationalisation.  This would only open the door for millions of babus to hold sway at the expense of the poor consumer.  Rather, Brinda should look at the success stories of private enterprise such as Westinghouse and General Electric as pioneers in electric supply.  She should know that India holds the dubious record for the largest power outage in the world when largely as the result of Sushil Shinde, Congress Minister being in charge of power, 500 million people in India or double the population of the USA had their power cut off in 2012!  Do we want somebody like that to be in charge or do we want an ace businessman like Tata?  I know which way the readers think!

                            I totally agree with Brinda's arguments about looting in privitization of public services, where the goal for the involved company and stakeholders is only profit. I also understand her doubts about AAP's ideology. AAp's economic ideology is no different from BJP's, as Ashutosh has demonstrated in his previous blogs showing total ignorance about and criticising socialist history and ideas in different parts of the world.<br/><br/>
Privitizing of education and health services is benefitting only a small percentage of population. Majority of people cannot get admission for the childern to highly branded private schools (boasting of air conditioned class rooms and swimming pools). But it will be day dreaming to expect from AAP's leaders to understand that if they cannot provide equality in opportunity to decent education to childern, catching a few corrupt teachers/headmasters will just be for sloganeering.<br/><br/>
All AAP has been able to achieve so far is more justification for the rotten capitalistic system. They think if some "faces" are replaced, the system will improve. New lies but with the same purpose of cheating the Aam Aadmi!!

                            @brinda Karat , There is a third option and that is exactly what AAP is asking for. Be it privatized but with strict auditing as market competition cannot play a role here. The profit has to be regularized after strict auditing. This can also be a practical solution as going back to the Gov owned discom is a huge U turn and may not find many takers.

I would even say we should have nation-wide regulator the same way as TRAI and whole sector should be opened up. All companies involved in public service should be subject to RTI and CAG audits.

                            @Seshadri: i just want to say one thing!!! get some thinking!!! prove her wrong on odisha!!! and in WB, WBPTCL a state owned power transmission company received gold medal from president presided over parliamentary committee in which active and high participation of BJP members was there!!! With the amount of population that WB has with a less land mass, till 2009 only 1858 mouzas were not electrified, out of which around 380+ electricity posts were washed away in the sunderbans due to cyclone!!! so get some thinking when u speak!!!

                            What is needed is to let private gen /trans / discoms run the show with adequate regulatory control.<br/><br/>
Brinda mired in her own ideological quicksands, is offering well-informed analyses of how Cong BJP politicians loot public assets, one way or another.<br/><br/>
One only wishes the Communistss had set a great track record of progress with sensitivity for the poor in WB and Kerala!!!<br/><br/>
With the kind of genetic material pervading public space in our country, no quick fixes, sirjee.

                            Extremely well written and revealing article, Brinda! I agree. Electricity being a fundamental right can not be left to private parties to dispense. We must consider public sector involvement again. But the paradox is that public sector enterprises have invariably failed on most counts in the past. How do we make them accountable? surely the old model for these organisations will have to be scrapped. Hiring young talent from the IITs and IIMs and getting retired executives from the private sector will be a step in the right direction. Can AAP take this plunge? To be fair, it is the only political party that can: hope Arvind reads your piece and suggestions like these.

                            A party with a minscule representation (CPM) supports halfheartedly another party which is a Delhi phenomenon and equally minuscule party (AAP). So much for a third front !!! This is why BJP and Congress have nothing to worry about. Crabs in the well will pull down each other !! I hope Congress gets over the Raga madness and becomes a constructive opposition so there are checks and balances in this country

                            Brinda mistakes AAP ideology as leftist.<br/>
At no time has AAP claimed to be a leftist organisation.<br/>
It has always been for capitalism but not Crony capitalism.<br/>
Capitalism is not bad, except when it is used for the rent seeking cronies, like during UPA and probably under NDA as well( not seen any evidence to the contrary yet).<br/>
Privatisation has to be with checks and balances and transparency and periodic impartial audit.<br/>
That is what AAP is aiming for, not merely changing the contractor.

                            Brinda Karat, Stop living in 18th Century. This is a service &amp; Information era in which only Private sector can provide service.<br/>
Look at your own pathetic public sector service delivery in west Bengal.Stop having problems with every solution. No wonder communist parties are not appealing to new generation.

                            Why was the private power company CESC supplying power in Bengal when your CPM was in power? Is hypocrisy the primary requirement for being a communist?

                            Is it possible to charge all the electricity companies what ever extra money they have been charging for the last decade for example. Also, hand of BJP and congress be investigated to find the reason as to how these parties participated in loots.

                            Privatisation in this country is fraught with danger of total monopoly one day without control. Wherever privatisation is planned parallaly a strong regulator has to be there. Given the culture in this country of people working for improving only self and not benefit of society, the regulator should have 5 members two of whom are subject matter experts and three from Judiciary to maintain balance of decision in case of deciding by vote. The chairperson for all these regulators should be ONLY from Judiciary.

                            Though Brinda is correct in her assesment here..but the CBI or any police had to conduct an inquiry as CAG is not a prosecuting agency.<br/>
If any issue of fraud is found...The state should prosecute.<br/>
But these things are lost in political rhetoric...BJP AAP Cong are parties but the govt is govt and is run by rules and procedure..

                            AND WHAT WAS BRINDA KARAT'S EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY RULED BENGAL TO THE GROUND FOR 34 YEARS, WHEN THERE WAS NO ELECTRICITY FOR DAYS AND YEARS<br/>
AND WHAT ABOUT THE PWOER DISCOMS IN KOLKATA CESC SOLD OFF TO THE GOENKAS AND THEIR CLOSENESS TO THE CPM LEADERSHIP IN BENGAL?<br/>
BRINDA KARAT FORGETS THEIR OWN HISTORY<br/>
CPM IS NOT A COMMUNIST PARTY, IT IS A HARD CORE PETTY BUORGOISIE PARTY IN THE GUISE OF COMMUNISM, WITH ZERO ETHICS AND ZERO COMMITMENT FOR ITS PEOPLE<br/>
THE PEOPLE OF BENGAL HAVE SEEN THEM FOR 34 YEARS AND THEY HAVE BECOME HISTORY
