Headline::::Can PM Share his Mann Ki Baat on Giriraj Singh



DateTime::::2015-04-02T15:00:00+05:30



(Brinda Karat is a Politburo member of the CPI(M) and a former Member of the Rajya Sabha.)
	Wouldn't it be a step forward towards a Swacch Bharat if the Prime Minister gave as much importance to cleaning up garbage in public life as on the streets? If that is too ambitious, can he at least start with his own Government and party? In a single day, two senior and elected leaders of the BJP made gender-offensive and racist statements.
	Â 
	Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar showed his contempt for working women when he mocked nurses on a hunger strike for better wages, telling them that they would ruin their marital prospects if their complexions darkened by their demonstrating in the sun. He says he has been misquoted, but the nurses stand by their version. His reported statement is objectionable on several grounds. It ignores and trivializes the genuine demands raised by nurses who serve and save sick people in his State, and is thus anti-worker. It is blatantly sexist - would he have said the same for men sitting in the sun? It is racist, because it promotes a discriminatory attitude against dark-skinned women. It is wholly patriarchal with its assumption that the aim of a woman is to get married.
	Â But such are the low levels to which political discourse has descended that this objectionable statement from a Chief Minister was overshadowed by the utterances of a Minister of State in the Modi Government. Giriraj Singh's disgraceful and uncouth comment on Sonia Gandhi got the reaction it deserved: outright condemnation. If he can make personalized comments about the colour of skin of the President of the main opposition party in Parliament, what can women in his constituency expect when they have to go to him as their MP for any assistance they require?
	Â 
	The man is a serial offender. He was banned from campaigning by the Election Commission after his statement that all opponents of Modi should be sent to Pakistan. Three cases were registered against him for hate speech in Jharkhand and Bihar. This did not deter him from making another communal statement that all terrorists belong to one community. Needless to say, he was a vocal supporter of the individuals belonging to the Hindutva brigade who are in jail for terrorist attacks targeting Muslims and the killing of innocent people. He came out in support of the violent love jihad campaign.
	Â 
	But his target is not only Muslims. He is a supporter of the banned landlord militia outfit ofÂ Â  Bihar - the notorious Ranvir Sena, a terrorist organisation backed by Bhumihar and other upper caste landlords in Bihar responsible for massacres of dalit families, as in Lakshmanpur Bathe, in the name of fighting Naxalites. In this massacre in 1997, 61 dalits, including 16 children, 27 women and 18 men were brutally killed. The massacre was led by Brahmeswar Singh alias Mukhiya who in 2012 himself became a victim of the violence he had bred, and was shot dead in his village. At the funeral, Giriraj Singh was a prominent mourner. Speaking on the occasion, he equated the killer of dalits as a disciple of Mahatma Gandhi and a patriot. At the time, he was a minister in the Nitish Kumar government.
	Â 
	He is both a product and a representative of the brand of politics which India is currently subjected to. The politics propagated by the RSS Hindutva brigade does not just co-exist with, but strengthens the Trimurti of communalism, casteism and patriarchy; they march together in Modi's Bharat and Giriraj Singh is their Ambassador.
	Â 
	BJP chief Amit Shah is reported to have asked him to exercise "restraint." The words sound familiar. Was it not the same advice given to "Sadhvi" or to the notorious "yogi" and others? In truth, these people and others of the parivar are speaking exactly as they are meant to. Their language, the words they use, are meant to polarise society on religious and also on caste lines. Their attitude towards women is part of the DNA of the ideology they represent. Therefore they take the advice of "restraint" as they know they should. Bow your head and wait for the tap on your shoulder for the next election, or the next dispute when your divisive speeches will be the order of the day.
	Â 
	This time the damage has gone further - upto the door of the Nigerian Embassy. It is astounding how the Government practices hypocritical and double standards. A documentary on a brutal gang rape in Delhi if shown will get India a bad image, but an insulting and racist statement actually naming a country by a minister in the Modi Government is treated casually, even though it has caused damage to India's standing among African countries and in the international community.
	Â 
	But even that will not affect our Prime Minister. The legitimate demand to remove Giriraj Singh will be ignored. The Prime Minister's Mann ki Baat is how to ensure the next round of victories in the elections scheduled for 2016. That is the only measurement. So Giriraj Singh will stay on as a minister because of the supposed vote bank he represents, and his apologists will advise us not to make a mountain of a molehill.

Isn't it because they are physically attractive, why is it that Meera Kumar not used as their star campaigner and not Rahul, Sonia and Priyanka campaign. Did the cong party share its Mann Ki baat when Congressmen called Modi - Azgar, Bandar, Chipkali, cockroach, did your blood boil when Modi was called this. If not then why now. What has Sonia done for this country that your blood boils for her and not for Modi who is son of the soil whereas Sonia is a foreigner.

                            I do not see any comment from Brinda Karat and her leftist team on Development, terrorism in Kashmir. Giriraj's comments are absolutely incorrect and has no place in our society. But when are leftist friends are going to participate on the real issues of India and solve them. Or are they best suited as detractors. <br/>
Thankfully we have great leader like Mr. Modi, who is steering India out of the clutches of congress and leftists.

                            Left party is an outdated useless party...It has no ideas bereft of will to do better. 30 years it had governed it could have done something better..However with ego of marxists they are ones which will kill industries. It is ok if they are against capitalists but what good they are doing if govt enterprises fail and show substandard service..These parties never whip the employees of PSU or govt organizations to give better service and root out corruption but will always side with employees and labor however inefficient and bloated they are. Fools are people who support these pseudo intellects.Example: In Telangana(Ramagundam) FCI (Fertilizer corporation of India) which was shut down for 2 decades is being restarted with 5000 crores from conglomerates of PSUs. All power plants sanctioned in Telangana are being given to PSU's(NTPC and BHEL and Singareni).3 decades back IDPL(Indian Drugs and pharmaceuticals limited) was shut down and plans are being done to revise with govt money..All these are now being revised with new Govts at center and state. So on whose side these things are done? This CPM is a useless party and its time it is booted out of Bengal..

                            Again we see a communist spouting platitudes and exhibiting holier than thou attitude. Communism as a system of governance has been thoroughly dis-credited globally and it should be thrown in the dustbin of history. It is the sad truth of India that the intellectual space has been occupied by communists and left liberals.Sooner this dominance ends the better it is for the country. Can Brinda Karat apologize for the mis-rule, goonda raj and atrocities that the left front committed through their cadres and administration on the people of west bengal for over 30 years. I lived in Bengal during the 1990's and I have seen first hand the atrocities that were committed by the left front. One example; if you apprehend a criminal red handed in your locality, you do not take him to the police but you should take him to the sector committee of the Left front in your locality. The leader of the sector committee will decide whether he should be handed over to police or not. TMC is using the same template of violence that was first set up by the left front.

                            Giriraj Singh's comment has ignited a very significant issue: the colour obsession of the Indian Society. Didn't some cultured VVIP talk about the dark complexion of a certain class of women? Examples are aplenty but the issue has never been discussed fully by informed circles of public opinion. Okay, how many Indians have taken a wife from "black" skinned communities? or how many Indian women have chosen a husband from the black skinned members of the human society?

                            Why we want to talk random topics which sway away from this article ? Yes , we got burning issues to address , but whatever is being trying to raise in this article irrespective of political affiliation , It's genuine.                                        Don't blame hierarchy before we change they way we respond . Want to make difference? Then do admit , calling someone inferior because of race , color and religion is pathetic. Now what's the big deal ? Well it is ! If someone like our ministers ( be it Congi/ bjp ) stirs the pot on such aspects , we got right to condemn it and ask questions about it . Are you superior just because you are white or black or Hindu or Muslim ? That's the big deal we are trying to ask .

                            "Can PM Share his Mann Ki Baat on Giriraj Singh?"  Ms. Karat...NO.....I am sorry to say that our PM has been so busy touring other countries that he has forgotten Hindi and needs a translator to check what Giriraj singh said about any woman....so, he is not obliged to share his mann ki baath.

                            It is harsh reality that Indians don't treat whites and blacks on par. Several African students in India have complained about occasional harassment. At the same time Indians face racism in other countries, for many whites Indians and Blacks are the same and most recently a Gujarati Grandpa was beaten and paralyzed just for taking a walk in the neighborhood. So how come somebody who makes an observation is the culprit here, when in case of "India's daughter" everybody jumped in favor of BBC reporter. Is freedom of expression not for politicians? Only for journalists?

                            Brindaji, I am at loss to understand what Modi has to do with the improper comments of Giriraj. The title of your blog needlessly drags Modi into the issue. Do you expect PM to waste his precious time by involving himself in such unsavory issues? Such things are unfortunately happening on daily basis in our country.I think media, politicians, law enforcing agencies,etc., are enough to show people like Giriraj their place.
