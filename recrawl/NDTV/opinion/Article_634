Headline::::Muslim and the City: Flats Rented to Us Become Off-Limits Overnight



DateTime::::2015-05-28T14:51:00+05:30




                                I saw some outrage yesterday on social media and news channels about a young woman in Mumbai asked to vacate her flat because of her surname. Misbah Quadri, who had moved into a three-bedroom apartment  in Wadala, was allegedly told by her broker that she could not move in the flat as the society was averse Muslim tenants.
The girl was interviewed by various news channels, and we pretended that we woke up to a phenomenon . Really ? How many of us have Muslim friends who haven't  shared stories of not being able to get an apartment because of  their surname in "cosmopolitan" metros like Delhi and Mumbai?
I remember arriving at a Greater Kailash apartment in South Delhi with my bag and baggage all the way from Mumbai to find the door locked. I had met the family who owned the flat a week before that - the son, a doctor who was in Delhi for vacation from London, the father a businessman from Haryana. When I landed at the gate, the watchman said he had no instructions to allow me in. I had a contract; a deposit had been paid to the owner, and brokerage to the concerned broker. I called the broker half a dozen times and he pleaded ignorance. He reached the house half an hour later to return the deposit and the brokerage commission.
"Madam, kuch Nizamuddin mein dikhaoon, aapke type area mein," he said, pointing me in the direction of a neighbourhood popular with Muslims in Delhi." I don't think I have ever felt so humiliated. Others have shared this crisis. A photo journalist from the city had to stay in a sort of hostel in Daryaganj in Old Delhi for two months because the owners who promised to rent him their flat were concerned about terror links - after all, he was both a Muslim and a Kashmiri.
The incident of Misbah Quadri has shocked us because it took place in Mumbai, a cosmopolitan city. Apologies, but I am hugely surprised at the outrage. Remember, this is a city where brokers tell you that certain pockets of Nariman Point are only meant for occupancy by Jains, and an owner of a popular penthouse in Walkeshwar has said he wants no Muslim to enter his house for fear of Goddess Lakshmi walking out in protest.
For a moment, let's forget the upmarket, elite, educated South Mumbai circle. My family stays in Navi Mumbai; my younger brother will be moving into a three-bedroom apartment close to where my parents stay in Vashi. For the last eight months, the builder and his broker have been trying to convince him to sell the flat, with the owner of the apartment building personally willing to placate him with a wholly unexpected profit margin. The reason - out of about  60 flats in the fifteen-storey building, the rest belong to non-Muslims and they "would not want any display of flesh during Bakri Eid" in the words of the builder.
In the last six months, my brother has had the humiliating experience of being called to the society's office and being asking to vacate, though the requests are now less aggressive with my brother threatening to file a police case should there be any attempt at intimidation.
His friends tell him he is lucky to have managed an apartment in a posh locality in Navi Mumbai because mostly, Mussalmans stay only in 'their' areas, which would mean pockets in dirty localities owned by fellow Muslims. Yes, this is the same city which is forever in homage to the Khans, the troika of Aamir, Salman and Shah Rukh. But unfortunately, that's the extent of cosmopolitan Mumbai on far too many occasions.  Remember a less popular Emraan Hashmi complaining of being refused an apartment by virtue of his faith.
I feel nauseous when I am told these are exceptions to the norm for this is the city of Manto from where he gave us his best work. Manto wrote about the colourful brothels in the city while staying in the famous Arab Gully in Byculla (a Muslim-dominated suburb). He wrote from Lahore  "I am a walking, talking Bombay. Wherever I happen to be, that is where I will make a world of my own". But the same Manto who wrote his seminal work in then Bombay had to be saved by actor Ashok Kumar with whom he was riding in a car during post-partition riots in the city.
Yes, this was a city of the liberals, a city where Muslim actors like Dilip Kumar, Madhubala, Meena Kumari, Mehmood, Johny Walker were revered with realms written about their iconic status. Who made Bandra and Andheri posh suburbs to live in.
The same suburbs where you can easily identify the pockets inhabited by Catholics and  Muslims. And for those who are disappointed, my earlier defense of this city's cosmopolitan character was shredded naked  during the Mumbai riots, when the two main communities sought blood. Urban, classy Mumbai ends somewhere near Byculla, and the less-educated perceived-as-crass Mumbai is represented by pockets like Nagpada and Mohammed Ali Road, where liberal and fashionable Mumbaikars make a trip during Ramzan to eat that lavish spread awaiting them . That is when  every non-Muslim in the city flaunts that Muslim friend who will provide a tour of the Ramzaan iftaar spread of firni and bheja fry and dal ghee at Mohammed Ali road . The same locality where my friend from Peddar Road has been asked not to venture into unless it's very urgent and she is accompanied by a driver.
This is a city where most non-Muslims would get goosebumps while watching Naseeruddin Shah perform at Prithvi Theatre and lose no time in outraging over his 'friendship with Pakistan' remark.
The unfortunate news for my friends who appear  naive about this ugly face of the glamorous Mumbai is that much as we may pretend otherwise, Mumbai is as guilty as far less modern parts of the country when it comes to the 'us' and 'them' demarcation.  We have as a city accepted it, though we rarely acknowledge it.  I did too, when, after the Mumbai riots,  my family moved from the 'cosmopolitan' Sahar Colony in Andheri East to Deonar, another Muslim suburb. This was not very long ago.
There are a thousand Misbah Qadri cases that take place in this metropolitan city, only many like me, do not have the time , energy and zeal to fight it. And for this, we are all complicit.(Rana Ayyub is an award-winning investigative journalist and political writer.

                            I'm a Hindu - Maharashtrian and I was denied a flat for purchase in a society which according to the broker was of Gujratis &amp; Jains. Imagine, I'm a Maharashtrian who was denied a flat in Maharashtra. If people in the society have such mentality what's the point in living with such people?<br/>
Please don't make this a anti-Muslim thing. This is quite common and in the end you can always choose another.

                            Dear writer please keep in mind that these type of stories with vested interest will not work much now a days. These type of propaganda would have worked 15 years before. Now the people are more educated and connected through social media which gives a less biased view of every news than the press media.

                            There are muslim owned businesses in hyd that only hire muslims. Also in the muslim dominated old city only muslims are elected. And the treatment of non-muslims in middle east, pakistan needs no introduction. Sad but true. I'm not defending any religion here but these are the consequences of religion being placed above and beyond everything else.

                            Just look at the dirt and filth Muslim dominated areas have created.. Visit Kurla once and you will know. When a Muslim cuts a bakra in the society where small kids see .. You will know the reason why Muslims are not allowed in societies... They don't have a sense of hygiene and care for others sentiments.. It's nothing to do with religion or cast. So stop your filth Rana

                            What has happened to that muslim woman not allowed for rent - we need to condemn anyway.<br/><br/>
But Recently I went into some old lanes of my Old City to buy some herbal medicines and dry fruits in some muslim areas.<br/>
I was stared by the Muslims there as I has a small tilak on my fore head.<br/>
Even if Tilak was not there - they generally stare and dont allow non muslims to come into their areas.<br/>
There are No Go Areas also in lots of Old City Muslim lanes in India.<br/><br/>
Can you please also resolve this issue. Please.

                            Agree, Muslims should do some introspection. Its not just Hindus but other communities as well who do not want them in their housing societies. Ours was a very reputed Mumbai suburban housing complex which many years ago welcomed Muslims even though our neighboring societies did not. Today our society is in a mess with Muslim boys (literate but not uneducated) behaving like gundas and lot of other problems. Today people of all other communities in the society are fed up with the nuisance and have started to sell their flats and leave. We repent the decision now and every one says that in future they will not repeat this mistake. Rana Ayyub please advise whats our fault?

                            Total nonsense, I personally faced problem finding flats in Mumbai because I am a non vegetarian. I never complained, I took it as a bad match and thats all. Still I got my flat rented in the same city. This is absolutely rubbish to see these stories through religious specs. Please tell some thing good.

                            If you want to visit a Muslim locality, Bakrid is your day. Blood flows through the narrow open drains and severed heads displayed outside houses.

I am a Maharashtrian, born and brought up in Mumbai. Just recently I contacted a plush developer for a 3 BHK in Goregaon. He was quoting a premium price in the range of 3 - 4 crores which was well within my budget. He heard my name and said - "Aap Mumbai mein kahan dekh rahey ho. Aap log Virar Vasai mein dekho naa". I was shocked! <br/><br/>

Sometimes it is not discrimination. Like there are societies which are only constituted for people working in a department, or if they are of certain caste or religion of society. It like having separate toilet for men and women. Do you think it is sexist?

                            I live in Bangalore. A hindu family stays in front of my house.Their owner is a Muslim. The Muslim owner does not allow them to put Rangoli during festivals, saying its not allowed in Islam.what do u have to say about this, Rana??<br/><br/>
It happens with everyone. Do not act victim for each &amp; every minor incident by giving it a communal angle. North Indians are not welcome in Southern states, South Indians are looked down upon in North,Biharis are not welcome in Maharashtra,Hindus are not welcome in Muslim areas,there are jobs only for Muslims,there are houses only for Muslims,Political parties favor the Muslims, Hindus were thrown out from Kashmir,Hindus were burnt alive in a train in 2002. There are numerous such examples where religion,caste,language have been placed above anything.<br/><br/>
If  Hindus can be alienated in their own country, if Hindus can feel unsafe in their own motherland, in spite of being the majority, then who are you?? stop cribbing about each and everything that happens to your community

I believe we are just looking at the two communities, but the fact remains that such discrimination are alike from people from all religious background Hindu, Muslim, Christians, Jains, and all alike. On the better side, this discrimination based on cast &amp; religion is mind set of a few people and not the majority. So I see this case &amp; issue is over amplified.

                            The herd mentality and exclusiveness is not just against muslims but it applies to anyone who is considered a minority in our society. Every part of India it happens but what is striking is only if it happens to a muslim it is highlighted and blown out of proportion.  A 76 year old Brahmin priest was physically assaulted by a group of youngsters calling themselves athiests recently and that has not got attention of anyone including the police.  Here we do not know the full truth and we already jump to conclusions. While the girl might have been thrown out of the apartment it might be the action of the broker or that of an overreacting individual and so please do not pass judgments and pronounce the verdict as guilty

                            Please dont make this a religious discrimination only issue. It is a racist issue which is part of the fiber of our society. We are bengali brahmins who eat non-vegetarian food and we are denied housing in many buildings in vile parle wrst and east since the majority of population there are Gujaratis, Jains and Maharashtrian Brahmins. We dont even get function halls for rent as we will serve non- veg food to our guests. This is part of the society we have created to divide people based on their preferences. Since we are Hindu Brahmins we cannot even claim religious discrimination. Media is creating a sensation of this and similar news but people living in Mumbai know that this is nothing new and toms of people face such discrimination daily. Please dont feel that you are being singled out due to your faith.

We both live happily and even share food on festivals. There are many streets and areas where people of different countries and religion live happily with no issues or anything. Why on earth Hindus and Muslims in India live together. My Hindu friends please grow up to stop discriminating people on the basis of their religion. <br/><br/>
I have many friends in Mumbai with similar problem not able to buy flat because they are Muslim. Hindus will leave peacefully in UK, US , Dubai with Muslims from different countries then why Indian Hindus can't live with Indian Muslims.<br/>
The right wing party and external organisations are trying to divide people on the basis of religion for their benefit. We shouldn't be supporting them. Indian Muslim should go to Supreme Court to punish builders and brokers. At the same time good Hindus need to come forward to support Muslims.

                            Hello Rana Ayub!<br/><br/>
Thank you for your article. <br/><br/>
I understand what ever happened to Misbah Quadri, is wrong certainly. <br/><br/>
I have some questions if you can answer them.<br/><br/>
1) Are only non-muslims to be blamed for this mishap?<br/>
2) Do non-muslims get homes in muslim dominated areas or societies or localities?<br/><br/>
You &amp; me both know highly muslim dominated societies or localities &amp; suburbs hence will not point out those again.<br/><br/>
I do not understand how Misbah Quadri did not find house for herself in Wadala / Antop Hill as it does have good population of muslims.<br/><br/>
Localities like Mumbra, Agripada, Mahim, Nagpada, Bandra, Kalwa, Chunnabhati, some part of Dharavi these localities are dominated by slums mostly owned by muslims. Now I DO NOT mean that Misbah Quadri should stay in these slums what I mean to say is if a non-muslim has to get a hut in these localities are you damn sure that non-muslim will get it?<br/><br/>
Mira Road is 95% population of muslims no complaints. Find a house for me in Mira road.<br/><br/>
Misbah Quadri should have been more interested in having a apartment to stay. Is having a apartment important or having an apartment in a particular locality important? She could have certainly looked for apartment in Mira road &amp; she would have got it easily.<br/><br/>
Nallasopara &amp; Virar - both have 75% muslim population. Find a house for me in a muslim dominated society.<br/><br/>
Mohammed Ali road- Find a house for me here too.<br/><br/>
Malad West Chincholi bundar link rd, I can take you to this society &amp; you will have to convince society to give a flat on rent to me. in 2004 I went to this society for a PG accommodation but I was denied after that I did try n number of times.<br/><br/>
Malad Malwani - get a me house here too.<br/>
To summarize if muslims do not get houses in non-muslim localities then non-muslim also do not get house in muslim localities too. Which I truly believe is really very bad.<br/><br/>
You need to understand it is not just one person is responsible.<br/><br/>
Personal choice per se I would be comfortable in staying in a locality which has people of my faith however discrimination / caste biased is certainly NOT GOOD.

                            I agree that the hurt felt by the aborted of the tenancy was unacceptable and I agree that the incidents complained about cannot be justified.  However, in the interests of balance, why no mention of the fact that Muslims do have a well deserved reputation for violence and other crimes.  The rape of the photo-journalist was not committed by Hindus who phoned their friends to say 'Maal aa gaya'.  The 1993 bombings were not carried out by Hindus.  The 26/11 incident was not carried out by Hindus.  Underworld dons Haji Mastan Mirza and Dawood Ibrahim were not Hindus.  Abu Salem is not  Hindu.  Mustafa Dossa, who was auditioning 'models' while awaiting trial is not a Muslim.  On another point, Hindus and Jains do have the right to live in 'societies' where meat is not allowed just as Muslims would be entitled to have 'societies' where pork consumption is forbidden.

                            Hindus feel equally nauseous when we are told in no uncertain terms that we will be welcomed into hell for not believing in the west asian stories of jesus or allah. How could you patronizing folks from Christianity and Islam forget all the nonsense which you heap on Hindus? You folks say that we will go to hell and likewise some Hindu thinks that Lakshmi Devi will walk out because of your faith. What's there to complain? Take it on the chin and move on as we Hindus have been doing for millennia now. No?

                            This happens all over the World. Like in US, Jews community protect their pockets, Whites protect their neighborhood from Blacks... I am sure there are such Muslim pockets in India too. Muslims in India have been pampered by Congress party for too long and made them into 'Cry Babies' !!!

                            Marathi man in Maharashtra cannot get flat in a Gujarati Jain area. This is the reality of Mumbai but no one shouts for they are rich and wealthy

                            Pls read midday mumbai today.. Now the entire story has a different spin and miss misbahs explanations sound hollow now.. What's the point though. Damage is already done.. One has been made into a martyr and blame already shifted on who knows who all..

                            Good article! Its about time that somebody pointed out the hypocrisy of the so called 'cosmopolitan' city! I am a Gujrati Mumbaiker and I agree that we need to get our heads out of the sand and seriously introspect the city that we want to live in...

                            All writers writing this kind of story should first talk about the plight of Kashmiri Pundits, advocate strongly their rehabilitation back in Kashmir in the same places they lived before. They should write about tortures on Hindus, Christians and others  in many non-secular countries. Otherwise, they will prove themselves to be one-sided.

                            Pained by the expressions of intolerance masked by justifying this discrimination by citing seemingly similar but totally irrelevant examples. Isolated biases are a ever present experience but blatant, continuous religious discrimination of minorities is plain wrong. We in the majority have to uphold the values of fairness for minorities, stop this hypocrisy of being the oppressor AND the victim.

                            This is an article about problems of Muslims trying to find accomodation in Mumbai, not about Kashmir or Afghanistan or Iraq. Is it so difficult to understand that?
