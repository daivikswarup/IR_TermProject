Headline::::AAP Full of Alka Lambas, Come, Break Our Bones



DateTime::::2015-08-11T14:22:00+05:30




                                It was 7:20 or so in the morning. I was still fast asleep when my mobile rang. I picked up the phone though half asleep. The person on the other side told me that Alka Lamba, an MLA from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had been attacked and was bleeding profusely. I immediately jumped out of bed. It was raining very heavily. I called and spoke to her. She was shaken but very determined. I asked her to go to the hospital and have her wounds seen to. Alka Lamba had spent years in the Congress, but in December 2013, she joined AAP and successfully contested the Delhi assembly elections from the Chandni Chowk constituency.
It was a gloomy Sunday morning. I took my umbrella and drove all the way to Aruna Asaf Ali hospital. Alka was there, surrounded by party volunteers and a few policemen. Her head was bandaged and she was composed. She narrated the incident. She, with more than fifty volunteers, had gone to the nearby Hanuman temple. This area is overflowing with drug addicts and drug peddlers. On the anniversary of the 1942 Quit India movement, she had started a campaign against the drug menace in this area.
A day earlier, she had tweeted about this program and also called up the local SHO and Deputy Commissioner of Police, Madhur Verma, and sought security for the campaign as any attempt to fight the drug menace was fraught with risk. Mr Verma promised support. She reached the venue around 5 in the morning but there was no police. She waited for some time and when no police person was seen, she again called up DCP Verma who promised to do the needful immediately. The police reached the spot and in their presence, she started talking to people when suddenly a stone hit her on the head. Volunteers saw a young boy wrapped in a quilt trying to flee from the roof of a sweet shop. The boy was caught and handed over to the police. People from that area told me that they had cross-checked and that the sweet shop belonged to OP Sharma, a BJP MLA (he has denied this in multiple interviews).
I phoned DCP Verma again and apprised him about this fact; he said the shop owner was related to Mr. Sharma. I requested him to handle this carefully and asked that those responsible for the attack be identified. But I was shocked to see that 24 hours later, it was Alka who was booked for trespassing by police. The Police had apparently reached the conclusion that her allegations were false. Mr Sharma was not even questioned. Rather, a new video had surfaced in which Alka was seen to be throwing the cash register in the sweet shop from where the stone had been hurled at her.
Not only this, Mr Sharma called Alka names and threatened her with dire consequences if she attempted the same (a raid to highlight the drug menace) again. He said that the next time, she would "go back on a stretcher" and her "limbs would be broken". But nothing happened to him. No case. No questioning. In less than 24 hours, it was Alka who was held responsible for the incident.
Can a state be more brazen and more shameless?
Alka is the sixth AAP MLA to bear the brunt of the brutality of the Delhi Police. Every minor incident is blown out of proportion and false cases are slapped against them. I don't need to say yet again that the Delhi Police is under direct control of the central government, and the central government is led by none other than the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, who, as Chief Minister of Gujarat was known for the fact that he seldom forgets or forgives those who are not his friends. 
AAP's crime is that it dared to challenge the might of a leader and a party who in its nature is intolerant and leaves no space for dissent and disagreement. Fortunately or unfortunately, AAP is here to stay in Indian politics. We are not here to play a 20/20 match but a test match. A test match is a real test of skill, technique, talent and finally, of patience. We are aware that many lethal bouncers will be hurled at us, injuries will be inflicted on us, hands and limbs will be broken, and our souls will be brutalized. We know political brutalities will follow, and many of us either will be politically finished or physically damaged. 
But the fight will continue. Of this, be sure.(Ashutosh joined the Aam Aadmi Party in January 2014.)Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

                            Honestly when I saw and heard Aravind first I felt he should win and show new way to Indian politics, but so unfortunate that these guys have turned out to be a bunch of immature jokers.  So rightly the more experienced Pranab da handed over constitution book to kejriwal when he met him first.<br/><br/>
Just to have right views is not good enough, how maturely you turn those views to acceptable legislature is important.  Don't work like a gang of thugs.  And this fool comes out to air his stupid views getting more disrepute to AAP.<br/><br/>

                            You all in AAP are worthless dramatists. For you the whole world except AAP (so long as one is not thrown out of AAP) is corrupt, dictator, liar, useless, fascist etc etc. You have become swollen headed as well as blind. Yours is the kind of blindness that makes you see conspiracy by others in everything including your constipation or diarrhoea which people witness during debates and interviews on TV screens. You quarrel and fight with and curse everyone over everything. You are the erstwhile Indian Gods and Goddesses of virtue who had gone missing at the end of Satyuga and have now found their way out of the cave in which they had disappeared and now emerged to take India out of the dark period in which India finds itself. You are the purest of the pure 67 children of God led by the high priest of honesty, integrity, morality and governance whom God has given the contract for cleansing anything and everything. The tragedy however is that all the filth that you collect from your so called system cleansing crusade ends up in spreading deep and unbearable stink around you and the irony is that you don't realise that you stink horribly bad and hell of a lot!

                            Ashutosh, we already know that AAP is full of criminals and foul mouthed people. No need to say it aloud. What more can we expect from an anarchist party that uses drama as political strategy. How can you guys be so shameless and protect someone who has been caught on CCTV doing vandalism. If the AAP MLA was injured, she should have gone to the hospital/doctor for treatment rather than vandalize the shop. Moreover; the AAP MLA said that there was a lot of bleeding from her injury, but the CCTV footage did not show any blood on her face or head?

You have all the AAP leaders and ex-AAP leaders becoming paranoid. It was Pande who was screaming that the Delhi Police tried run their Vehicle over him and now Alka saying the same thing and not to miss the bus, Yogendar Yadav accusing that Delhi Police tried to finish him off.<br/><br/>

                            Isn't NDTV intelligent enough to verify the facts of Alka Lamba? <br/>
If she can support her claims with time recorded photographic evidence of her presence at the sweet shop at 5:00AM and the subsequent joining of her co-workers and recordings up until the event of someone throwing stone at her, then the Police can investigate the matter.<br/>
Else she and her co-workers are better of behind bars in the Police station.<br/>
Shame to to see Kejriwal praising her instead of ensuring his goons don't take the law into their hands.<br/>
In India no single party respects Law &amp; Order and always they think they are Kings or Queens.<br/>
We should ensure the Police always show their place in the society.

BJP+Cong nexuses with drug mafia and Delhi police is responsible for easy flow of drug to youth of the city and surrounding areas. What police has done is nothing but what was expected from Delhi police - they shielded the criminals and put the victims behind bars. More such things will happen in future as APP will progress towards cleaning the Capital of our country from these goons/ criminals/ drugs/ corruption.
