Headline::::Who Deserves Reservations? Supreme Court's Big Verdict



DateTime::::2015-04-07T16:24:00+05:30




                                
	(Dr. Shashi Tharoor is a two-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, the former Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Human Resource Development and the former UN Under-Secretary-General. He has written 15 books, including, most recently, India Shastra: Reflections On the Nation in Our Time.)
	In all the understandable attention paid to the Supreme Court's judgement on Section 66A, the media and the commentariat have overlooked another Supreme Court decision at roughly the same time which is potentially even more far-reaching and significant for our democracy.
	In a 64-page judgment, a Bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and Rohinton Nariman (who also wrote the 66A judgement, though this one is mainly Justice Gogoi's work) struck down the UPA Government's notification including Jats in the Central list of OBCs. Equally significant was the rationale the Justices provided: they observed that the State should not go by the "perception of the self-proclaimed socially backward class or advanced classes" on whether they deserved to be categorised among the "less fortunates." New formulae, the Court averred, have to be found to determine backwardness.
	Most significantly, the Supreme Court held that caste, while acknowledged to be a prominent cause of injustice in the country historically, could not be the sole determinant of the backwardness of a class. "Owing to historical conditions, particularly in Hindu society, recognition of backwardness has been associated with caste. Social groups who would be most deserving must necessarily be a matter of continuous evolution. New practices, methods and yardsticks have to be continuously evolved moving away from caste-centric definition of backwardness," the Court argued in its judgment.
	The Court ruled that the State should maintain a high level of vigilance to uncover emerging forms of backwardness in a continually evolving society. "The gates would be opened only to permit entry of the most distressed. Any other inclusions would be a serious abdication of the constitutional duty of the State," the court warned.
	The Government had claimed that the inclusion of the Jats on the OBC list was based on the "compelling factor" that the Centre is obliged to "work in tandem and not at cross purposes" with the States, which had already included Jats in many State OBC Lists over a decade ago. The Court rejected that reasoning, observing that such "grave and important" decisions in reference to Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution must be made on the basis of "contemporaneous inputs", which were not available. (The statistical data on which the Government had based itself was more than ten years old and the Court felt that it was already "outdated and antiquated" for the purpose).
	Most striking are the court's observations on what constitutes "social backwardness". It says that educational backwardness, which the Government referred to, isn't enough; neither is purely economic backwardness, though both may contribute to social backwardness. "But social backwardness," the Court observes, "is a distinct concept that emerges from multiple circumstances ranging from the social and cultural, to economic, educational and even political."
	What about caste, since Jats are, after all, a caste in nine northern Indian states? The Court concedes that caste may be a prominent factor for 'easy determination of backwardness', but the judgment discourages "the identification of a group as backward solely on the basis of caste" and calls for "new practices, methods and yardsticks" to be evolved. It adds the observation that class may be a factor too, since a class is "an identifiable section of society", but again it may not be enough to justify reservations. Citing its own decision to recognize transgenders as a distinct community with justiciable rights, the Court pats itself on the back for identifying a form of social backwardness that has nothing to do with caste or class. Its judgement points to the shifting definitions of various groups in determining their eligibility for Government benefits.
	This is fascinating philosophically, but it opens up a proverbial can of worms for government policy-makers. The most contentious element of the Court's judgement is, of course, its proposition that caste, and the need to right historical wrongs, is no longer sufficient grounds for government benefits. Nor is the self-perception of a caste that it's backward; not even the perception by other castes that a caste is backward is good enough. New methods, the judgement insists, have to be developed to identify the backwardness of a group of people.
	The Court, drawing a somewhat fuzzy line between 'past' and 'emerging' forms of backwardness, advances the presumption of the "progressive advancement of all citizens on all fronts, i.e., social, economic and educational" that makes history an insufficient guide. You can't keep citing historical wrongs and propose reservations as a solution to redressing them, the Court says. What it doesn't do, though, is to take the logic of its own reasoning one step farther, by challenging caste-based reservations altogether.
	Still, it has set off a conceptual bomb under the complacent edifice of the reservation system. We have long accepted the logic of reservations in our country as a means of making up for millennia of discrimination based on birth. This is why the Constitution inaugurated the world's oldest and farthest-reaching affirmative action programme, guaranteeing Scheduled Castes and Tribes not only equality of opportunity, but guaranteed outcomes, with reserved places in educational institutions, governmentÂ  jobs and even seats in parliament and the State Assemblies. These reservations were granted to groups listed in Schedules of the Constitution on the basis of their (presumably immutable) caste identities. The addition of the OBC category --after the acceptance by the VP Singh Government of the recommendations of the Mandal Commission -- added more people to the numbers benefiting from reservations, but it didn't change the basis on which they benefited: despite the "C" in "OBC" referring to "classes", the OBC lists contained castes and sub-castes.
	So we witnessed the unedifying (and unwittingly hilarious) spectacle of castes fighting with each other to be declared backward: the competitive zeal of the Meenas and the Gujjars in Rajasthan to be deemed more backward than each other would have been funny if both sides weren't so deadly serious. As an uncle of mine sagely observed, "In our country now, you can't go forward unless you're a backward."
	The transgender judgement, and the latest one disqualifying Jats, opens the floodgates to far-reaching questions. If caste isn't a good enough basis, and class isn't either, and now lack of education or income doesn't suffice, but the misfortune of being born transgender does, then how do we determine who deserves reservations in our society? The Supreme Court says historical wrongs are passe; the Government needs to establish that a group of potential beneficiaries is suffering backwardness right now. But it doesn't tell us what criteria to apply.
	This leaves open all further Government classifications to future Court challenge. That may be what the Court wanted, but they should beware the doctrine of unintended consequences. What if someone goes to the Supreme Court saying that following this decision, the entire existing system of reservations - and every established list of SCs, STs and OBCs -- should be reviewed, since they were all based on historical wrongs and "antiquated" data? Why should only Jat claims be dismissed on that basis, and why not everyone else's? And if that happens, doesn't it open the Court to the logical follow-up question: since the very basis for deciding them has been demolished by the Court, are reservations themselves unconstitutional?
	The shadow of Pandora now hovers over the Supreme Court -- but her notorious box may already have been opened by this dramatic, and surprisingly under-reported, judgement.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

I strongly say "They are. Reservations is social injustice when equally and rather more qualified person is denied the opportunity and the same is given to less deserving person. It is a very big social inequality".

                            'As an uncle of mine sagely observed, "In our country now, you can't go forward unless you're a backward."' - Since you are a Nair, it is not surprising that your uncle opposes reservation. For centuries nairs have plundered and eaten off the hard work of others. When you are able to give compensation for that, we can think about removing reservations.

                            Supreme Court made sure that common sense prevailed. Including social, economical &amp; educational parameters to determine affirmative action is the most logical but un-popular verdict(un-popular for politicians).Lets implement this policy in government services. For e.g., any central or state government employee who earn more than 300k p.a. should not have his next generation avail affirmative action. As they are socially, educationally and economically well off like the rest of people around him/her. Alongside, we can bring in people from other class/caste into the affirmative action until they also use up. This will be ensure everyone benefits and no one considers this as their 'Jagir'

                            Muslims have been marginalised by successive Governments,this is inspite of many commissions giving evidence that they r indeed backward,eg the Justice Sachar Commission and some others as well.When Muslims r given reservations in Gov jobs,educational institutions etc courts strike down those reservation as unconstitutional for they r on the basis of religion,but Dalits r given reservations only when they r Hindu,when they convert to Islam or Christianity they r denied that privilege.Why it is that Dalits get reservations only when they r Hindu? is this reservation not on the basis of Religion? how is that constitutional?.

                            Reservation on caste greatest menace in our society ...Reservation is a discrimination from not the upper caste but the other 99% of lower caste which never appears in these exams due to lack of resources..<br/><br/>
 You may not appear in exam due to lack of resources but appearing and scoring low counts to your individual efforts.<br/><br/><br/>
We all know the real  backward caste sufferers rarely get a platform to appear in such exams...and those creamy layer which never get them self registered as creamy layer of the backward caste turn out to be most corrupt of executives.<br/><br/>
Cant reservation be on individual family income....It can be but poltical parties and vote bank ....these rotten people have not even left a inncoecent child studying out of it.<br/><br/>
We have followed reservation from some 50 years has it bought any change to lives of majority of lower caste adivasi , mahadalits ...no... but it has kept the vote share of these parties united<br/><br/>
reduce fees for them in their education, Enable free schooling for them , not giving 1 out of 1000(usually a rich backward call individual)  a chance to snatch seat from a more deserved( might be hard working student of any upper caste).

                            Not against the reservation. But there is no plan to systematically lift the reservation. once enjoyed the reservation should bar their children to enjoy the reservation. I know one well known doctor who studied on reservation and well settled, but instead of he lifts his own children, the childrens are also studying in reservation. Reservation should not be a right for the community permanently irrespective of their economic status. If the parents are able to spend for their children, then reservation should not be allowed for them. Social injustice.

                            Mr Akshay has clearly explained about injustice made by human in caste system. The majority of upper class people are not allowing lower class people to uplift their standard.Every lower class people are struggling hard to lead life in the society.All should understand each and every body in the earth are born to live happy. Nobody is allowed to discriminate by caste.In this scientific and advanced scenario people should understand every body is getting birth through their mother and father only.Nobody can change this nature.And every body dies one or other day.In between every body needs basic things to lead their life.This is same for all.Then where upper and lower has come. Only few uneducated people made this discrimination earlier.Why at present also it is followed blindly.Because of that it is necessary to up lift the lower class people through reservation system.

                            Reservations, if provided to any person under any category, must be purely only a ONE TIME instance. Providing reservations at every level, from LKG school admissions to jobs to promotions at each and every level, is denying capable and meritorious candidates from rising, and driving India into backwardness. Present policies of providing reservation to SC/ST candidates from the Muslim and Christian societies is strange. These religions do not preach any caste, so defining the reservations on caste basis to these people on caste basis is not logical. A new definition of 'backward' is rightly to be made, as stated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Hope sense rules, and these strange reservations finally are struck down, or restricted to a ONE TIME basis.

                            55 ppl in India's Richest list are Baniyas, except Ajim Premji, and  there is isnt much inclusion of other communities even when list moves to 100.<br/>
So if we have reached equality in our state why hasn't anyone from other communities have been able to breach this wall.It shows that historical placement and community bonding does have an effect. People do not see merit while doing or starting or inviting someone else to business but only their caste. If you have caste card you will face least resistance<br/>
After Independence, like communist state, we didnt take everyones property and brought everyone on same line. People who were placed well are still well or have improved. There is caste dividend that pays. <br/>
In private education instituition, which are owned by caste organisations, do see that only people belonging to their community are getting jobs and many of these institutions are sponsored by governments. Even if others are given jobs, they see too much of resistance in getting promotions. Like, if you're taken as Lecturer you will be stuck their but a person of institutions caste background will reach the top easily. So how many of private educational institutions are owned by backward communities. Most of the prominent institutions were started during or just after Independence struggle when backward communities, were, of course backward.<br/><br/>
Just today Lohia statue was cleaned after Manjhi garlanded it and last time I checked it is 2015[no discussion on whtr manjhi is capable or not, discussion is on something else].

                            While Caste was a predominant criteria for deciding reservation, it needs to be reviewed with regard to actual fulfillment of objective in the absence of such a review, the efficacy of the approach remains unproven. Review of the scheme would constantly add/ delete the beneficiaries &amp; eventually goal met. What is currently being felt is that only the top layer of the specific castes or class, reap the benefits and continue to avail despite really not deserving any more.

                            Mr.Tharoor. The criteria to determine a group as backward need not be specified by SC. By asking this you seem to render the Parliament  useless.  Also there is nothing wrong in reevaluating the whole system of reservation as it must never be based on caste/class. I would like to read another blog of yours as a follow up to this with your plan to eliminate reservation in India.  It won't happen in a century in our country notwithstanding

                            Reservations were created decades ago when some people were not being given equal opportunity based only on their caste. The rest of the world has moved on a lot since then and India should re-visit the caste-based reservation policy. The government should empower economically backward people so they get quality education, healthcare and jobs. The caste has nothing to do with equal opportunity in 21st century. I'm all for giving free education and resources (books, scholarships, etc.) to poor people... and upto a certain extent jobs too. But once you are in a school/college or a workplace, how you progress should be based on QUALITY, not the caste of that person. This will definitely benefit the country and its people.

It will take decades for Congress and its policies to change reservation system which should be purely baased on economic criteria rather than caste based reservation.

                            Actually there should be economic criteria also for reservations..<br/>
Some of the *so called*Back ward classes which in reality are very rich and powerful are exploiting the benefit of reservations ,<br/>
where as some of the *so called* upper castes are economically so poor that they are not even able to eat 2 times a day leave alone their education.  <br/>
Scheduled tribes are the  ones who are to some extent real in claiming the benefit of reservation..<br/>
Some others belonging to backward castes  are getting fake certificates of most back ward and scheduled castes .<br/>
There is is so much  corruption in the issue of certificates and the rich and powerful seem to exploit it well.<br/>
 in short today reservation is being misused by certain sections...using money nd muscle power <br/>
Time to review reservation policies ..If it is not possible to abolish it since the politicians wont do it fearing loss of votes ..atleast they should include economic status and eliminiate the rich and powerful from enjoying the reservation benefits unncessarily..

                            @MK <br/><br/>
So will you allow all religions to enter temples?<br/>
If people of other religion( read muslims and christians) respect Hindu beliefs and stop calling names to idol worshippers they are more than welcome.<br/><br/>
Will you allow dalits to do poojas in our temples?<br/>
By all means sir. How many dalits with open mind without any bias are ready to learn not just pooja but all scriptures. It takes many years to become well versed in scriptures.You cannot force anyone to learn scriptures so its not just about pooja. Infact many temples have poojaries from different background and no one asks them any questions about their earlier background. Only people like you have less knowledge.<br/><br/>
Will you stop insulting low castes for being born in that caste?<br/>
There is no guarantee.Ambedkar said reservations for only 10 years and all agreed to that.Did they respect Ambedkar and his 10 years philosopy. Will so called low castes who have tremendously benefitted in last 67 years because of reservations give guarantee that they will not insult so called upper caste people to keep continuing their reservations. Its not a one way street sir. Why creamy layer no giving up their benefits.<br/><br/>
Will you marry a dalit.. or will you allow your sister to marry a dalit man? <br/>
Yes if that so called dalit has open mind and open thinking. Was it not a upper caste lady who married Ambedkar.So whose openness and broad mindedness you are testing.The mindset of forever a victim will not lead you anywhere. You have to grow also.<br/><br/>
Will you allow dalits to sit along with you in a college or a school... A BIG NO. .<br/>
Since last 40 or so years i have seen everyone sitting with each other even eating with each other. I am not sure in which era you live. Either you are a non hindu or a creamy layer person who is just making nonsense.<br/><br/>
Toilet cleaners to continue as toliet cleaners for generations.. Brahmins to continue doing poojas for generations... You just wanted to stop reservations and enjoy the fruits of being an upper caste Hindu..!!<br/><br/>
Doing pooja does not yield you money. Many lower caste people are richer than a poor brahmin doing pooja in temple. Many brahmins also clean toilets because they cannot get any benefit of reservations.

                            Reservations is just excuse for not doing anything.Why these Indians dont understand that your population is more than a billion and will reach 1.5 billion soon how much reservation can you give when resources are stretched. Reservations is not a means to pull millions out of poverty and backwardness. Only way is to create processes which are same for everyone. We have disparity in providing facilities to people. People of this country are not idiots, give them tools they can find there own way.Reservations can only benefit small portion and pace is so bad. Some say till the last backward is uplifted we will continue reservations t them i can only say, if your population is not coming down how will you find the last backward. Also what is the mechanism to remove people from these reservation benefits once they have come up in life.<br/><br/>
The need in India is to remove people to people dependence, make everyone independent through digital economy this will break all barriers to caste, religion.

                            Finally a good article by Shashi, free of bias and full of logic. The apex court is right in its judgement that caste based reservations in an evolving society are not the right criteria for judging backwardness.People like Mayavati, a multimillionaire, gets reservation as a dalit. The famous Bill Gates Foundation motto, every human being deserves to lead healthy and productive life' should be followed in letter and spirit while framing policies.

                            People eligible for reservation would love reservation. On the other hand the ineligible ones will always condemn it and come up with a million reasons why it should be abolished. That is human nature. But unfortunately since this is such a controversial topic, it is eating away our society. So I would urge our policy makers to clearly proclaim the justification for the current system of reservation comprehensively.  This will clear the fallacy most people have about reservation.

                            Why are we talking about only reservations for job and education, and why not about political reservations?

                            If reservations is social injustice, why are we even talking about the British owing reparations to us?

                            You deserve reservation... you're a sort of Dalit albeit an intellectual type!

                            Here comes the time for another constitution amendment to bypass courts verdict. All parties will compete with one another to be messiahs of social justice.

                            Talent cannot be suppressed. Brahmin were denied professional college admission by  successive Dravidian Tamil Nadu parties. Result? Most merit students of the advanced communities took the US higher studies route and showed how to respond eminently to an unfair challenge.

                            Unless we lift the caste based reservation completely from our country, we will never achieve our potential. Our useless politicians have milked the system completely and the result has been a completely skewed system without the correct competitiveness. Only the poor need reservations and help. We all know that but out politicians like Karunanidhi, Yadavs, etc will never agree. Anyway, they are all on the wane and in a few years we may have a better set of people.

                            In our country reservation has been a thorny issue from Independence. Nobody likes to be considered backward unless there are significant benefits attached. Our reservation policy is almost completely caste based. Since the SC now feels that caste is only one component of backwardness, it is only a matter of time before this entire edifice of caste based reservation is challenged. It is true that caste based reservations have not fulfilled their basic promise of converting India into an egalitarian society. It may never do that, as any amount of affirmative action is unlikely to make black people equal in the USA. As the SC said, new yardsticks have to be developed. It is perhaps time to make financial backwardness the new template for reservations. The sticky point is political. How do you remove privileges from those who have enjoyed them for long? A long hard road ahead. Perhaps only SC decisions will be able to remove caste based reservations in India. Who will bell the cat?
